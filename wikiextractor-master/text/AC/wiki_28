After going on hiatus in 1973, the band returned with their original line-up in 1990 and has been active since then.\n\nThe Ides of March began in Berwyn, Illinois (a near western suburb of Chicago) on October 16, 1964, as a four-piece band called \"The Shon-Dels.\" Their first record, \"Like It Or Lump It,\" was released on their own \"Epitome\" record label in 1965.\n\nIn 1966, after changing their name to The Ides of March (a name suggested by bassist Bob Bergland after reading Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" in high school), the band released their first single on Parrot Records, \"You Wouldn't Listen.\" The song reached #7 on WLS Chicago on June 17, 1966 and #42 on the Hot 100 on 23-30 July 1966. This record and its follow-ups (all pre-\"Vehicle\") have been re-released on the Sundazed Records CD \"Ideology.\" \n\nIn early 1967, trumpeter Steve Daniels was added. He was succeeded in late 1969 by two horn players, John Larsen and Chuck Soumar, with Bergland often doubled up on tenor saxophone.\n\nParrot singles:\n(** these are the only two tracks they recorded in stereo during the Parrot years)\n\nKapp single:\n\nRay Herr, a folk singer who had been gigging with another local outfit, the Legends of Time, joined the Ides as alternate lead singer, (alongside Peterik), and rhythm guitarist. This allowed Peterik to concentrate on lead guitar. Herr first appeared on \"Girls Don’t Grow on Trees\" in 1967.\n\nLike Columbia's The Cryan Shames, they had local success in the Chicago area without much label support. Unlike the Cryan Shames, who issued 3 albums on Columbia, Parrot never scheduled an album for the Ides of March.\n\nHaving secured a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1970 the band released the track \"Vehicle,\" which allegedly became the fastest-selling single in Warner's history. Fourteen seconds of the completed \"Vehicle\" master tape (primarily the guitar solo) were accidentally erased in the recording studio. The missing section was spliced in from a previously discarded take.\n\nThe song reached #2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #6 on the corresponding \"Cash Box\" listings. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc in November 1972. The following album, \"Vehicle\", reached #55 nationally.\nThe band toured extensively throughout 1970 in support of many top acts, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Led Zeppelin. The Ides of March were also among the participants in the \"Festival Express\" train tour documented in a 2003 film, although they were not featured in the film.\n\nDuring the summer of 1970, Ray Herr was forced to leave the Ides to investigate his status with the local draft board. He changed his name to Ray Scott and formed the short-lived group Orphanage before relocating to Nashville to pursue a career in country music.\n\nIn 1971 the band released their second album \"Common Bond\". The featured single was \"L.A. Goodbye\". The song was at #1 on regional charts for five weeks, #2 on WCFL Chicago, #5 on WLS Chicago, but only #73 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn 1972 the band moved to RCA Records and released \"World Woven\". At this point, the band departed from the \"brass\" sound (though one song featured a single trumpet) and the album produced no hit singles.\n\nIn 1973 the \"Midnight Oil\" album was released. The band played its final show of their \"first era\" at Morton West High School in Berwyn that November.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1990, The Ides of March went on an extended hiatus, during which Jim Peterik co-founded the band Survivor and co-wrote all of their platinum hits including \"Eye of the Tiger,\" \"The Search Is Over,\" \"High on You\" and \"I Can't Hold Back\".\n\nHe also began a career of writing collaborations which resulted in many platinum hits for other artists, most notably \"Hold on Loosely,\" \"Rockin' Into The Night,\" \"Fantasy Girl\" and \"Wild-Eyed Southern Boys\" for .38 Special and \"Heavy Metal\" for Sammy Hagar.\n\nIn 1990 The Ides' home town of Berwyn offered to have the re-united group headline their \"Summerfaire.\" The concert was attended by over 20,000 and the Ides returned to live performances. The following year they released their first new music since 1973, a four-song cassette EP entitled \"Beware – The Ides of March\". Trumpeter and backing vocalist Chuck Soumar is credited with being primarily responsible for reuniting the band.\n\nIn 1992 the album \"Ideology\" was released with re-recordings of \"Vehicle\", and \"You Wouldn't Listen\", plus new material.\n\nAfter another five-year gap, 1997 saw the EP \"Age Before Beauty\" being released. And by 1998 the band wrote and released \"Finally Next Year\" to commemorate the Chicago Cubs' season. The song was included on a CD entitled \"The Cubs' Greatest Hits\" which was sold at all Major League ballparks. The song was used on many Cubs-themed radio and television programs.\n\nBy 2001, The Ides had expanded their schedule and returned to national touring. The band recorded a two-hour live performance for XM Satellite radio in Washington, D.C.. Also, \"Vehicle\" was used for an extensive national advertising campaign by General Motors.\n\nA double live album, \"Beware: The Ides of March Live,\" captured their concert at the McAninch Center at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. This live set was released on Rhino Records in 2002. Handmade Records released \"Friendly Strangers,\" a double CD limited run set of the original Warner Bros. recordings.\n\nIn 2004 the Ides of March celebrated 40 years since their original formation, together with a series of multi-media shows emceed by Dick Biondi. The sold-out show at the Arcada Theatre in St. Charles, Illinois can be seen on the DVD, \"A Vehicle Through Time.\"\n\n2005 saw \"Vehicle\" get further promotion when American Idol runner-up Bo Bice performed the song three times on the show. That same year, the Ides released their compilation CD, \"Ide Essentials.\" It included past hits (\"Vehicle,\" and \"You Wouldn't Listen\") and versions of Survivor songs including \"Eye of the Tiger\", \"High on You\" and \"Rebel Girl\", as well as new material. It featured the new single \"Come Dancing\", and a re-release of the Ides' first recording \"Like It or Lump It.\"\n\nThe Ides sang their Christmas carol \"Sharing Christmas\" to a capacity crowd at the 6 o'clock Mass at Chicago's Holy Name Cathedral in 2005, at the request of the church's pastor, Father Dan Mayall. They sang along with Dick Biondi and have continued to perform at the cathedral's 6:00 Christmas Eve Mass since then. A total of four Christmas songs were recorded by them and appeared on the \"Sharing Christmas\" album; copies were sold to raise funds for Holy Name Cathedral's Thursday Night Suppers.\n\nIn 2006 The Ides' first two albums, \"Vehicle\" and \"Common Bond,\" were nationally re-released on the Collector's Choice label. Sony BMG released \"Ides of March Extended Play\" nationally; the album was culled from the band's live recordings. \n\nIn September 2010 the City of Berwyn, Illinois, dedicated Home Avenue between Riverside Drive and Cermak Road (the location of J. Sterling Morton High School West, the school most of the band members attended) to \"Ides of March Way\" in tribute of the band.\n\nRay Herr (born on September 24, 1947 in Arlington Heights, Illinois) died on March 29, 2011 in Hainesville, Illinois, from esophageal cancer at age 64.\n\nJohn Larson (born on November 6, 1949 in Elgin, Illinois) died on September 21, 2011 in Warsaw, Indiana, from cancer at the age of 61.\n\nChuck Soumar quit the band in 2011 to pursue other interests.\n\nIn 2014 the Ides celebrated the 50th anniversary of the band. The original four members – Bergland, Borch, Millas and Peterik – are still playing together (after Peterik's hiatus to form Survivor). They have released a 50th anniversary career retrospective box set and a DVD called \"Last Band Standing,\" and continue to write and record new music. At their anniversary concert on September 27, 2014, they received a citation from the State of Illinois honoring their achievement as well as their charity work (the band established a scholarship fund at their alma mater, Morton West High School in Berwyn, IL).\n\nAs of 2018, the band continues to tour, both by themselves and as part of the \"Cornerstones Of Rock\" series where they act as the house band for a variety of '60s-era Chicago-area bands. They are also in the writing stages for a brand-new album.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An expansion pack titled \"\" was released in 2007.\n\nBecause of legal issues between Bohemia Interactive and Codemasters (the original publishers of \"Operation Flashpoint\"), Codemasters owns the intellectual property to the name \"Operation Flashpoint\". Since Bohemia Interactive severed its connection with Codemasters and no longer has the legal right to use the \"Operation Flashpoint\" name, \"Armed Assault\" is considered to be the direct descendant of \"Operation Flashpoint\". \"ARMA 2\" (previously referred to as \"Game 2\") was released in June 2009. Codemasters has released a rival title to Bohemia Interactive using the name \"\", in which Bohemia Interactive has no participation.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game features a \"Join in Progress\" option, so that players can play without waiting. The number of people allowed in a multiplayer game is limited only by the server's capability. NPCs are also available in multiplayer missions, both as allies and enemies, while the mission editor allows users to script battle scenarios. A cooperative mode of gameplay is also included, allowing players online to complete the single player missions as a human player squad. The \"Armed Assault\" community also creates custom content such as new missions, campaigns, factions and weapons.\n\nA new multiplayer mode that blends FPS and RTS elements was released as \"ArmA Warfare\" in the official update 1.14. \"ArmA Warfare\" contains team-based multiplayer missions with realtime strategy. Two sides fight for control of the entire map or destruction of the enemy base. Players must capture whole cities to gain resources that can be channeled into manufacturing even more weapons, units and \ncars.\n\nThe campaign in \"Armed Assault\" is narrated by Private First Class William Porter of the United States Army (voiced by Todd Kramer), and takes place on the fictional Atlantic island of Sahrani, an island nation which is divided in two, with the northern section a Communist nation called the Democratic Republic of Sahrani (DRS) and the southern one an oil-rich monarchy called the Kingdom of South Sahrani. The narrative begins when American forces, after a few months of training the South Sahrani military, begin to depart the island. Prime Minister Torez, leader of the DRS, uses this moment of perceived weakness to launch a full-scale invasion of South Sahrani. The player takes on the role of an American soldier in one of the U.S. Army platoons not yet rotated off the island before the conflict began. The few U.S. Army platoons remaining on the island aid the Royal Army Corps of Sahrani (RACS), the South Sahrani military, in fending off the more powerful northern neighbor's offensive, being spearheaded by the North Sahrani military, with the Sahrani Liberation Army (SLA) at the forefront. While the SLA offensive is successful at first, U.S. Army manages to halt the offensive and starts driving the occupying forces from the southern part of the island with plans to topple the regime on the north.\n\nThe campaign follows a linear storyline. However, each level in the campaign has options for the player on how to progress through the mission. The player's in-game performance and choices determine how the storyline progresses and ultimately will have a bearing on the war itself. For example, a mission to seize a crucial town can have a substantial effect on the story depending on the player's level of success or failure. Failure to successfully complete an objective does not result in the game ending but will affect the storyline. Hostile squads act independently of the player's actions so that they may be engaging in an activity dictated by the game A.I. that does not necessarily involve the player. This implies that the game has high replay value as no two games will be identical.\n\n\"ARMA\"'s expansion pack, \"ARMA: Queen's Gambit\" (also known as \"Royal Flush\" in the USA), was released on September 28, 2007 and contained a followup to the original storyline and added a second event afterward.\n\nThe campaign, Royal Flush, is the story of a Mercenary Team hired by Queen Isabella to eliminate chemical weapons. After the death of the original team leader, the team uncovers that the Queen has built detention camps for political prisoners and supporters of the Prince. Depending on the squad's actions there are a two outcomes:\n\n\nRahmadi Conflict follows up on the original campaign following Special Forces Commander Leon Ortega and his squad as they assault the last remaining SLA stronghold on Rahmadi, with the discovery of a \"President\" that is leading the SLA remnants. Depending on the team's action, The President will be captured, killed, or escapes the island.\n\n\"ARMA\" received average reception on its release, praised for the unique believability of its action but criticized for its difficulty, complexity, and bugs. IGN said \"\"ArmA\"'s adherence to realism and accuracy in terms of weapons and world design is highly commendable and hopefully will inspire other developers in similar directions.\" GameDaily praised its \"spectacular graphics\" and its multiplayer, but criticized its bugs and \"complicated menu system\". Computer Games Online said \"It’s hard...to believe that they actually thought that such an unpolished game would enjoy any kind of success.\"\n\nThe game has sold 300,000 units as of 28 February 2008. By 2010, sales has surpassed 400,000 copies.\n\nThe sequel, \"ARMA 2\", is a standalone military simulation video game for Microsoft Windows that was released in June 2009 using the Real Virtuality game engine. A well known mod DayZ was released on this title, it requires the standalone expansion pack game titled ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead.\n\n"}

The GC-2 motorway passes north of the town.\n\nThe Church of San Juan Bautista is the leading architectural and social monument in the municipality. It was built entirely in Arucas stone by local master masons, and it dates from 1909. Apart from the wealth of the carved stone columns and column heads, there are also some beautiful stained glass windows, the works of Canary Island painter Cristobal Hernandez de Quintana, and an extraordinary carving of the Reclining Christ, by Manuel Ramos. To the north is the Montaña de Arucas which is thought to be the area where courageous Doramas the Guanche leader was killed in 1481 by Pedro de Vera in the Battle of Arucas. Arucas is known for the production of rum.\n\nArucas was rebuilt in 1480 after being completely destroyed in 1478. Since the 15th century, the main crop of the Arucas area was sugar cane. Rum was produced here long before sugar plantations were cultivated in Cuba. One of the main features of modern-day Arucas is its rum factory. Arucas boomed with the demand for cochinilla (a beetle feeding off cactus pear, crushed to produce red dye) in the second half of the 19th century.\n\n\n"}

Originally, 60 students were enrolled in the school, which at that time was called Vocational High School. It was the first public school in California to offer summer school.\n\nThe school was named after J.W. McClymonds, who at one time was the superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District. Ida Louise Jackson, the first black teacher in the Oakland district, taught at McClymonds before her retirement in 1953.\n\nIn 1927, with $325,000 spent on additional classrooms, the school became more of a regular school than a summer school. In 1933, the legislative act was passed, regulating school building construction. This required that schools have steel and structural support on the inside. The building did not meet these requirements.\n\nThe school decided to move to 14th and Myrtle Street in the same building with Lowell Junior High School. McClymonds High thereby became a four year high school. The name changed from J.W. McClymonds to Lowell McClymonds, then to McClymonds Lowell High School. Finally, in September 1938, the official name of the school became McClymonds, and it was moved to 26th and Myrtle.\n\nIn 2005, McClymonds was split into three smaller schools: BEST, EXCEL, and Kizmet Academy, collectively known as McClymonds Educational Complex.\n\nIn 2010, McClymonds Educational Complex returned to being McClymonds High School. The school's 2010-11 theme was \"Mack is Back!\"\n\nOn September 24, 2010, the school opened a new, state-of-the-art football field, William Belford Stadium, named in honor of the late William \"Bill\" Belford (often called the \"godfather\" of McClymonds sports).\n\nMalcolm X gave a speech at McClymonds at a function sponsored by the Afro-American Association. A young Muhammad Ali also spoke at the function. The Black Panthers co-founder Huey P. Newton was in attendance.\n\nCurrently, many students are working in conjunction with students from nearby UC Berkeley to revitalize a dilapidated drug-ridden park into a history learning park and expand it into the school's campus.\n\nMcClymonds was featured in the book \"Black in School: Afrocentric Reform, Urban Youth & the Promise of Hip-Hop Culture\", by Shawn Ginwright.\n\nMcClymonds's average SAT score for 2013 was 1155 out of 2400. The nation's average SAT score for the year was 1497.\n\nIn 2007, McClymonds had over 100 graduates. \n\nIn 2008, McClymonds had the highest CAHSEE test scores in the Oakland Unified School District.\n\nThe McClymonds varsity football team which was led by captain and starter on both sides of the ball Keyshawn Roberts won the Division 5A state championship in January 2017. The Warriors defeated the La Jolla Country Day HS with a score or 20-17. The following year, McClymonds won a second consecutive state championship, defeating the Golden West High School Trailblazers in the California Division 5AA Football Championship 42-12. \n\nThe McClymonds varsity basketball team won a state Tournament of Champions held in 1978 at the Oracle Arena.\n\nMcClymonds offers a variety of sports, including football, baseball, basketball, cross-country, and track. Although McClymonds is separated into two schools, the sports teams are still one, with the mascot of the Warrior.\n\nOn May 16, 2006, the Oakland City Council adopted a resolution, sponsored by Council Member Nancy J. Nadel (District 3), congratulating the McClymonds Football Team For Excellence in Athletics and Academics, recognizing that McClymonds High School had ranked #1 in the East Bay and Northern California as the high school with the most football players (9) attending Division I universities, under the direction of head football coach Alonzo Carter. McClymonds was the only high school in the nation that year with three Top 100 prospects, and, with only 600-650 students, ranked #1 in Northern California for Division I Signees, and ranked #2 in the State, behind Long Beach Poly, which had 5,000 students.\n\nOn March 15, 2008, McClymonds achieved its first ever Division I state championship basketball win over Dominguez High School of Compton, California, 73-54, at the Arco Arena, as the culmination of their undefeated streak of 32 wins and no losses.\n\nMcClymonds' health center, founded by Children's Hospital doctor and UC Berkeley alumna Barbara Staggers, and named after activist Chappell Hayes, was opened in 2005. In creating the Health Center, Dr. Staggers partnered with Lisa Hardy, MD., Division Chief of Psychiatry at Children's, to ensure that mental health services would also be available to the school community. It serves McClymonds' students and alumni, and members of the West Oakland community.\n\nIn February 2020, a report stated that groundwater beneath the school was contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical.\n\n\n\n"}

The office was created by the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which provided for a period of transition from direct American rule to the complete independence of the islands on July 4, 1946. It replaced the office of Governor-General of the Philippines, who had direct executive authority. Under the Commonwealth, executive power was held by an elected Filipino President. The role of the High Commissioner was largely ceremonial.\n\nThe office of High Commissioner was held by:\n\n\nMurphy had previously served as Governor-General. Sayre's tenure was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. McNutt became the first United States Ambassador to the Philippines after Philippine independence in 1946.\n\nWith the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth, Malacañan Palace was turned over to the President of the Philippines, necessitating a new home for the highest American government official in the Philippines. A new location was found along now-Roxas Boulevard and a High Commissioner's Residence was built. According to the book titled Manila Americans by Lewis Gleeck. \"On April 1, 1937, McNutt arrived (in Manila) with Mrs. McNutt and a sixteen-year-old daughter. Since the relinquishment of Malacañang, there had been no official residence for the High Commissioner, so (Paul) McNutt moved into El Nido, the sumptuous Dewey Boulevard residence of Attorney E.A.

On February 22, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, again raised the flag at the High Commissioner's headquarters after recapturing Manila.\n\nThe High Commissioner's headquarters today houses the American embassy in the Philippines.\n\nThe American Residence in Baguio was built to be the summer home of the High Commissioner, to replace The Mansion that was the Governor-General's summer residence and that had been turned over to the president of the Philippines upon the inauguration of the Commonwealth.\n\n\n"}

The voice actors have stated that because of their personalities and tendency to goof off when together as a group, they would never get anything completed if they performed their lines collectively.\n\nStanford Leonard \"Stan\" Smith (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the title character on \"American Dad!\" who has an exaggeratedly masculine voice and manner about him. Stan is Francine's husband and Hayley and Steve's father. Hayley may or may not be Stan's biological daughter since Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party in the episode \"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\", but Stan regards Hayley as his daughter. As the Smith family breadwinner, Stan is a CIA agent. Early on in the series, Stan was exaggeratedly patriotic and Conservative. His character, however, has progressed over the course of the series from the ultra right-wing it had been. All the same however, Stan has proven to be drastic and extreme in numerous other ways beyond politics. He is often shown rashly taking extreme measures in ways that are conspicuously destructive, disastrous, and life-threatening to others. Making his extreme-measure taking worse, Stan is utterly inconsiderate and insensitive, thus he does not stop to think of how others are negatively impacted, nor does he care. As examples of this: in the episode \"Dope & Faith\" when Stan found out one of his friends was an atheist, he tried getting him to pray by blowing up his home, spreading the bird flu at his restaurant, brainwashing his wife into thinking she was a lesbian, and taking his kids away; in the episode \"I Can't Stan You,\" Stan evicted his entire neighborhood and his own family just for overhearing some of his neighbors gossiping about him behind his back; in the episode \"Four Little Words,\" Stan framed his wife as a murderer all so as not to hear her say the words \"I told you so\"; etc. Not a stranger to going to any and all lengths to achieve his desired ends—even to the point of shamelessly harming others—Stan is characterized as very dog-eat-dog. Aside from his thoughtlessly drastic and endangering behaviors, he has an endearing and sensitive side as well. It has been revealed that he very much desires fatherly love and attention but has always lacked this. Stan's parents separated when he was very young (later learned because of Stan himself in the episode \"Blood Crieth Unto Heaven\"); thus he has a father (Jack Smith) who was not around much and mistreated him.\n\nFrancine Lee Smith (née Ling, voiced by Wendy Schaal) is Stan's wife and the mother of Steve and Hayley. Indignant, Francine can usually be seen nagging and scolding her family (particularly Stan) over their wrongdoings. Francine often nags at her family to uphold certain virtues and over any unwholesome or reprehensible behaviors they engage in. Ironically, it is mostly in the midst of all her moralizing and urging others to do the right thing that she demonstrates blatant inappropriateness, indecorum, and inelegance. Sporadically while engaged in moralizing others, Francine will randomly throw in remarks and behaviors that are in bad taste and lack all propriety. Adding to her paradoxical nature, Francine's behaviors have been known to become downright immoral and sometimes even fiendish, all the while trying to get others to live more wholesomely and do what is right. For example, in the episode \"The Boring Identity,\" Francine made efforts to get Stan to be a more civilized and respectable husband. In the process, she deceived him into thinking he was an entirely different person after he got struck with amnesia. Another example, in the episode \"Can I Be Frank With You,\" Francine was disgruntled by the fact that she and Stan were not a closer couple. To achieve this, she encroached in on Stan's guys' night using a male disguise that could fart for extended periods of time. Francine has also been shown to have a randomly wacky and peculiar side. For example, in the episode \"The Scarlett Getter,\" while Francine was engaged in an angry rant about Stan, she stated \"Those two are stuck on each other like gum on a hot summer sidewalk on a summer afternoon. I'm sorry, I'm taking a creative writing class.\"\n\nHayley Dreamsmasher Smith (voiced by Rachael MacFarlane) is Stan and Francine's new-age hippie daughter and college-aged oldest and the sister of Steve. As revealed in the episode \"The Kidney Stays in the Picture,\" she may or may not be Stan's biological daughter, Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party; nonetheless, Stan regards her as his daughter. One to stand up for her beliefs, Hayley is passionate, insistent and vocal in her convictions. In mentality, she is portrayed as Liberal, what was originally intended to be the antithesis to her father's ultra-conservative mentality. These character traits were particularly emphasized in the show's beginnings back when Hayley was a focal character in the program; however, they were heavily toned down after early seasons. Intuitive and insightful, Hayley is able to instinctively grasp the hidden, inner, and obscure nature of situations. As examples, instantly upon entering the room in the episode \"Finger Lenting Good,\" Hayley realizes what Stan and Steve are up to in trying to get Jeff to hug them so as to lose his finger for engaging in a vice. As another example, in the episode \"Da Flippity Flop\" when the essence of Klaus has entered Stan's body and taken control over it, he attempts to deceive Hayley and Francine into thinking he is truly Stan; however, Hayley instantaneously and lackadaisically acknowledges that it is Klaus. Hayley can also be casually rude and insulting, particularly towards her brother, Steve. Several story arcs have been used with regards to Hayley's romantic relationship to Jeff. Back when the two were dating, they had several breakups. In one of their breakups, Hayley dated an urban black man in a koala body (Reginald the Koala) across a string of episodes. Since then, Hayley has married Jeff but continues to live under her parents' roof.\n\nSteven Anita \"Steve\" Smith (voiced by Scott Grimes) is the baby of the family and sometimes middle child who is Stan and Francine's high-school aged son and the brother of Hayley. He attends Pearl Bailey High School. There have been three versions of the \"Steve\" character over the course of \"American Dad!\" The first version was a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not to be confused with the season premiere episode entitled \"Pilot\"). This original version of Steve stood out as most contrasting and atypical, particularly in appearance and voice. In this precursor pilot, he was voiced by Ricky Blitt. Here, he was much nerdier, gawkier, and scrawnier than his later versions. By the series premiere, Scott Grimes began voicing the character. Also by the series premiere, Steve became taller, thicker, manlier and more mature than before, though still nerdy. By Steve's third design, he was made softer, more emotional, cuter, and more endearing than before. As part of his emotional and sensitive character, Steve is combined with a screechy wail. Despite his wimpy and nerdy characteristics, Steve is particularly conceited and obnoxious. Along with this, he often proves to be a showman, always ready to put on a performance and show off his abilities, often singing-wise. Steve shows great ambition and enthusiasm for his various interests and pursuits. He possesses a keen interest in the opposite sex and has had an obese girlfriend, Debbie, who Stan disapproved of. Steve's relationship with his father is strained with Stan often behaving judgmentally and intolerantly over Steve's nerdiness, immaturity, and sensitivity. Steve has been known to cop attitude, sometimes rightfully so at Stan over his offensive acts. Steve has three best friends: Snot (with whom he shares a bromance), Toshi, and Barry.\n\nRoger Smith (voiced by Seth MacFarlane impersonating Paul Lynde) is the very zany pansexual alien who lives in the Smith family's attic. Blithely so, Roger is depraved, devious, and cruel. He typically exhibits a lighthearted, carefree temperament while also engaged in his freakish grossness, outrageous malice, and rascally shenanigans. Having no limits on his shocking and brazen ways, Roger typically says and does anything and everything that comes to his mind.\n\nInitially being banned by the family from going into the public and often being depressive because of that in early episodes, Roger later begins to be shown to assume different aliases and has a carousel of seemingly endless costumes, which allows him to do almost everything he wants.\n\nKlaus Heissler (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker in a German accent) is the Smith family's hapless and saturnine goldfish. He is consultative and full of sage advice, sometimes even wearing glasses and taking on a scholarly appearance. Klaus was once an East German Olympic ski-jumper until his mind was transferred into the body of a goldfish during the 1986 Winter Olympics by the CIA to prevent him from winning the gold medal, leaving him permanently trapped in the goldfish's body. Klaus has yet to come to terms with what happened, at times malcontent and gloomy. Not confined to his fishbowl, Klaus is often seen uniquely scooting himself about the Smith residence, reclined in a glass of water. In these moments, it is only his very lower back that is actually in the water. In the early going, Klaus had an obsessive crush on Francine and often made sexual advances at her. For much of the series discounting its beginnings, the Smith family and particularly Roger have been shown to treat Klaus with disdain, take him for granted, and even mistreat him. Ironically, Klaus started out on the series as a bully, known for his ridicule and cruel teasing of all the show's main characters, particularly Roger.\n\nJeff Smith (né Fischer; voiced by Jeff Fischer) is Hayley's slacker, mellow, hippie, often stoned boyfriend and later husband. An unemployed high school dropout with no apparent skills, or employment motivation, he is emasculated, weak-willed, pathetic and frequently behaves naively. Jeff is often shown to be infatuated with Hayley's mother, Francine, having made subtle passes at her on many occasions. Jeff's own mother abandoned him early on, giving birth to him in a van, within which he lives until moving in with the Smiths. His relationship with his father, Henry, is abysmal, with Henry viewing and treating Jeff as a failure. Before moving in with the Smiths, Jeff lived from his van, which he had parked in front of the Smiths' residence when he started dating Hayley.\nIn the episode \"Joint Custody\" however, Jeff moves in with the Smiths as a result of Stan having a demolition crew crush his van into smithereens with a wrecking ball. Stan effected this in an effort to get Jeff away from his [Stan] property. Throughout the series, Hayley repeatedly dumps Jeff for being a needy, clingy pushover, leaving Jeff crushed until their inevitable reconciliations.\n\nIn the show's one-hundredth episode, the two finally marry.\n\nIn the episode \"Naked to the Limit, One More Time\", Jeff learns that Roger is an alien. Because of this, Stan informs that he must kill either Roger or Jeff to protect his family. Roger, however, informs that he will call his fellow aliens to take him back to his birth planet; however, Roger surprise chucks Jeff into the spaceship while he stays behind on Earth.\n\nIn the Season 9 episode \"Lost in Space\", Jeff escapes from an alien spaceship and starts to make his way back to Earth.\n\nIn a Season 10 episode \"Longest Distance Relationship,\" Jeff is able to communicate with Hayley through a CB radio and discovers a way to return to earth through a wormhole. Jeff and Sinbad's Ghost arrive 60 years in the future and learns that he cost her a chance to have a great life with Millionaire Matt Davis. Unhappy with having upset the family and giving the elderly Hayley a heart attack, he and Sinbad's Ghost return through the wormhole. Jeff tells the again-young Hayley to move on with her life.\n\nIn the season 12 episode \"Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!\", it is revealed that Jeff was killed by aliens and his body dissected, before an alien disguised as Jeff is sent to Earth to capture Stan. The alien later has Jeff's brain planted into his body so he can remain on Earth with Hayley as Jeff.\n\nIn the episode \"Portrait of Francine's Genitals\", Jeff revealed he took Hayley's last name, making him Jeff Smith. Later in the season, in the episode \"Roger's Baby\", Jeff is reborn as a human, via Roger eating his brain and rebirthing him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in \"Homeland Insecurity,\" it is revealed that Roger's excrement is solid gold and jewel-encrusted. The Golden Turd enters the life of different characters which often end with someone dying or suffering some other terrible fate. The following characters appear in \"The Golden Turd\" sketches:\n\n"}

{"id": "2082696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082696", "title": "Paula Modersohn-Becker", "text": "Paula Modersohn-Becker\n\nPaula Modersohn-Becker (8 February 1876 – 20 November 1907) was a German painter and one of the most important representatives of early expressionism. Her brief career was cut short when she died from postpartum embolism at the age of 31. She is recognized as the first known female painter to paint nude self-portraits. She was an important member of the artistic movement of modernism at the start of the twentieth century.\n\nBecker was born and grew up in Dresden-Friedrichstadt. She was the third of seven children in her family. Her father Carl Woldemar Becker (January 31, 1841 Odessa – November 30, 1901, Bremen), the son of a Russian university professor of French, was employed as an engineer with the German railway. Her mother, Mathilde (November 3, 1852 Lübeck – January 22, 1926 Bremen) was from an aristocratic family von Bültzingslöwen, and her parents provided their children a cultured and intellectual household environment.\nIn 1888 the family moved from Dresden to Bremen. While visiting a maternal aunt in London, Becker received her first instruction in drawing at St John's Wood Art School. In 1895 she was introduced to works of the artists' circle of Worpswede; Otto Modersohn, Fritz Mackensen, Fritz Overbeck and Heinrich Vogeler presented their paintings in Bremen's Art Museum, Kunsthalle Bremen. In addition to her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Becker received private instruction in painting. In 1896 she participated in a course for painting and drawing sponsored by the Verein der Berliner Künstlerinnen (Union of Berlin Female Artists) which offered art studies to women.\n\nBecker's friend Clara Westhoff left Bremen in early 1899 to study in Paris. By December of that year, Becker followed her there, and in 1900 she studied at the Académie Colarossi in the Latin Quarter.\n\nIn April 1900 the great Centennial Exhibition was held in Paris. On this occasion Fritz Overbeck and his wife, along with Otto Modersohn, arrived in June. Modersohn's ailing wife Helen had been left in Worpswede and died during his trip to Paris. With this news Modersohn and the Overbecks rushed back to Germany.\nIn 1901 Paula married Otto Modersohn and became stepmother to Otto's two-year-old daughter, Elsbeth Modersohn, the child from his first marriage. She functioned in that capacity for two years, then relocated to Paris again in 1903. She and Modersohn lived mostly apart from that time forward until 1907, when she returned to Germany. In a letter to Rainer Maria Rilke written from Worpswede on February 17,1906, signs of a troubled marriage emerge, \"And now, I don't even know how I should sign my name, I'm not Modersohn and I'm not Paula Becker anymore either\".\" Less than a month later she writes from Paris to her husband, \"try to get used to the possibility of the thought that our lives can go separate ways\". \n\nBy 1906, Becker (now known as Paula Modersohn-Becker) had reversed her previous desire to avoid having children and began an affair with a well-known Parisian \"ladies' man\". However, by early 1907 she returned to her husband, became pregnant, and in November delivered a daughter, Mathilde.\n\nAfter the pregnancy, she complained of severe leg pain, so the physician ordered bed rest. After 18 days he told her to get up and begin moving, but apparently, a thrombus had formed in her leg, and with her mobility, broke off and then caused her death within hours.\n\nIn 1898, at age 22, Becker immersed herself in the artistic community of Worpswede, where artists such as Fritz Mackensen (1866–1953) and Heinrich Vogeler (1872–1942) had retreated to protest against the domination of the art academy style and life in the big city. She studied under Mackensen, painting the nearby farmers, and the northern German landscape. At this time she began close friendships with the sculptor Clara Westhoff (1875–1954) and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926).\n\nUntil the years when Becker began the practice, women painters had not widely used nude females as subjects for their work. The only notable exceptions to this dearth are works by Artemisia Gentileschi, three centuries earlier; for example, art historians assume that Gentileschi used her own body as the model for her work \"Susannah and the Elders\". Becker's work on the female nude is unconventional and expresses an ambivalence to both her subject matter and the method of its representation.\n\nBecker was trained in the methods of realism and naturalism, along with a recognizable simplicity of form. She was able to achieve a distinct texture to her work by scratching into the wet paint. She later abandoned those techniques to move into Fauvism. There is evidence to suggest that a number of Paula Modersohn-Becker's self-portraits were influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Rossetti, including \"Self-portrait with a bowl and a glass\" (c.1904; Sander Collection), \"Self-portrait nude with amber necklace\" (1906; Private collection), and \"Self-portrait on my sixth wedding anniversary\" (1906; Museen Böttcherstrasse, Paula Modersohn- Becker Museum, Bremen). She may also have influenced one or more of Picasso's paintings, as Diane Radycki posits in her 2013 monograph on the artist.\n\nUntil 1907 Modersohn-Becker made another six extended trips to Paris for artistic purposes, sometimes living separately from her husband, Otto. During one of her stays in Paris she took courses at the École des Beaux-Arts. She visited contemporary exhibitions often, and was particularly intrigued with the work of Paul Cézanne. Other Post-Impressionists were especially influential, including Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Fauvism influences also appear in her works such as \"Poorhouse Woman with a Glass Bottle\". \n\nIn 1906, Modersohn-Becker left Worpswede, as well as her husband, Otto, to pursue an artistic career in Paris. In a journal entry dated February 24th, 1906, a sanguine Modersohn-Becker wrote, \"Now I have left Otto Modersohn and am standing between my old life and my new life. I wonder what the new one will be like. And I wonder what will become of me in my new life? Now whatever must be, will be.\" Despite her sister's and mother's general disapproval of Paula's decision to leave Otto for Paris, her relocation there proved to be quite prosperous for her. It was during this time frame that she accomplished her most intensive work. From this body of work she produced a series of paintings about which she felt great excitement and satisfaction. During this period of painting, she produced her initial nude self-portraits, unprecedented for female artists, as well as portraits of her friends, including Rainer Maria Rilke and Werner Sombart. Modersohn-Becker was incredibly optimistic about her artistic progress during her final trip to Paris. In May of 1906, she wrote a letter to her elder sister, Milly Rohland-Becker, in which she stated, \"I am becoming somebody - I'm living the most intensively happy period of my life.\"\n\nIn 1907 Paula Modersohn-Becker returned to her husband in Worpswede, despite period correspondence that indicated her desire for independence. She wrote in detail about her love for her husband but also of her need to delay motherhood in her pursuit of artistic freedom. She continued to express ambivalence regarding motherhood as she was concerned about her ability to paint while raising a child; her diary entries indicate that she had planned on achieving a painting career by age thirty, then having children. So, when her daughter Mathilde (Tillie) Modersohn was born on November 2, 1907, Paula and Otto were joyous. The joy became tragedy nineteen days later, when Paula suddenly died. She had complained of pain in her legs after the delivery, and was advised to remain in bed. When the physician returned on 21 November, he advised her to rise. She walked a few steps, then sat down, called for the infant to be placed in her arms, complained of leg pain, and died, saying only \"What a pity.\" She was buried in the Worpswede Cemetery. \n\nModersohn-Becker employed the same technique throughout her short career as a painter. She worked in tempera and oil with a limited range of pigments such as zinc white, cadmium yellow, viridian, and synthetic ultramarine. \n\nBy 1899 Clara Westhoff had made a bust of Modersohn-Becker, saying that it was a symbol of their friendship and shared passion for art. In 1908 Rainer Maria Rilke wrote the renowned poem \"Requiem for a Friend\" in Modersohn-Becker's memory. \n\nIn 1927 the businessman Ludwig Roselius opened in Bremen the Paula Modersohn-Becker Museum, designed by Bernhard Hoetger. Local Nazis denounced its art and architecture in 1935, but Roselius ignored this until Hitler denounced his entire Böttcherstraße in September 1936. After Roselius's secretary Barbara Goette intervened on his behalf with Hitler, the Nazi leader allowed the street's buildings to remain as a monument of \"degenerate art\".\n\nMathilde Modersohn (1907–1998) founded the Paula Modersohn-Becker Foundation (Paula Modersohn-Becker-Stiftung) in 1978. \n\nIn 1988 a stamp with the portrait of Paula Modersohn-Becker was issued in the series Women in German history by the German post-office authority Deutsche Bundespost.\n\nPaula Modersohn-Becker was not widely known at the time of her untimely death, and would have dropped into obscurity but for her voluminous writing. She maintained a diary, and corresponded regularly with friends in her artistic circle. Her letters were collected and widely published (in German) during the 1920s, and it was largely through them that her legacy was maintained. In the 1970s, US art historian Diane Radycki first translated them into English (they have also been translated by others since then). Two-thirds of the correspondence occurred from age 16 to the early years of her marriage, and it is full of youthful optimism and energy.\n\nOn the 8th of February 2018 Becker's birthday was celebrated in a Google Doodle.\n\nModersohn-Becker was included in the 2018 exhibit \"Women in Paris 1850-1900\".\n\nModersohn-Becker's house in Bremen, where she spent much of her life, opened in October 2007 as a private art museum and gallery. Her family moved from Dresden to Bremen in 1888 and lived in this house. Becker lived here until 1899, when she was 23 years old, and set up her first studio in this house. There was an active artist community in Bremen and via Becker's mother's friendships in the art world, Paula grew to be part of the community. Apart from her teacher training in Bremen in 1893–1895, Paula took private instruction in painting. It was not well known that the young Becker had lived here for ten years; in 2003 Heinz and Betty Thies bought the then run-down house, and had it restored in time for the 100th anniversary of the artist's death. At that time (November 2007) it was turned into a public museum.\n\nThe life of Paula Modersohn-Becker is fictionalized in Sue Hubbard's 2012 novel, \"Girl in White\". She was also the subject of a 2016 German biographical film called \"Paula\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes called the Beck tripleability theorem because of the older term \"triple\" for a monad.\n\nBeck's monadicity theorem asserts that a functor\n\nis monadic if and only if\n\nThere are several variations of Beck's theorem: if \"U\" has a left adjoint then any of the following conditions ensure that \"U\" is monadic:\n\nAnother variation of Beck's theorem characterizes strictly monadic functors: those for which the comparison functor is an isomorphism rather than just an equivalence. For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism.\n\nBeck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the descent theory, which plays a role in sheaf and stack theory, as well as in the Alexander Grothendieck's approach to algebraic geometry. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of algebraic structures (e.g. those in FGA and in SGA1) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via fibered categories and descent data was shown (by Jean Bénabou and Jacques Roubaud) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach.

Both appeared, alongside several other important theorems, in a well-known paper by József Beck. The two results described below primarily concern lower bounds on the number of lines \"determined\" by a set of points in the plane. (Any line containing at least two points of point set is said to be \"determined\" by that point set.)\n\nThe Erdős–Beck theorem is a variation of a classical result by L. M. Kelly and W. O. J. Moser involving configurations of \"n\" points of which at most \"n\" − \"k\" are collinear, for some 0 < \"k\" < \"O\"(). They showed that if \"n\" is sufficiently large, relative to \"k\", then the configuration spans at least \"kn\" − (1/2)(3\"k\" + 2)(\"k\" − 1) lines.\n\nElekes and Csaba Toth noted that the Erdős–Beck theorem does not easily extend to higher dimensions. Take for example a set of 2\"n\" points in R all lying on two skew lines. Assume that these two lines are each incident to \"n\" points. Such a configuration of points spans only 2\"n\" planes. Thus, a trivial extension to the hypothesis for point sets in R is not sufficient to obtain the desired result.\n\nThis result was first conjectured by Erdős, and proven by Beck. (See \"Theorem 5.2\" in.)\n\nLet \"S\" be a set of \"n\" points in the plane. If no more than \"n\" − \"k\" points lie on any line for some 0 ≤ \"k\" < \"n\" − 2, then there exist Ω(\"nk\") lines determined by the points of \"S\".\n\nBeck's theorem says that finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points.\n\nAlthough not mentioned in Beck's paper, this result is implied by the Erdős–Beck theorem.\n\nThe theorem asserts the existence of positive constants \"C\", \"K\" such that given any \"n\" points in the plane, at least one of the following statements is true:\n\n\nIn Beck's original argument, \"C\" is 100 and \"K\" is an unspecified constant; it is not known what the optimal values of \"C\" and \"K\" are.\n\nA proof of Beck's theorem can be given as follows. Consider a set \"P\" of \"n\" points in the plane. Let \"j\" be a positive integer. Let us say that a pair of points \"A\", \"B\" in the set \"P\" is \"j-connected\" if the line connecting \"A\" and \"B\" contains between formula_2 and formula_3 points of \"P\" (including \"A\" and \"B\").\n\nFrom the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, the number of such lines is formula_4, as follows: Consider the set \"P\" of \"n\" points, and the set \"L\" of all those lines spanned by pairs of points of \"P\" that contain at least formula_5 points of \"P\". Since no two points can lie on two distinct lines formula_6. Now using Szemerédi–Trotter theorem, it follows that the number of incidences between \"P\" and \"L\" is at most formula_7. All the lines connecting \"j-connected\" points also lie in \"L\", and each contributes at least formula_2 incidences. Therefore the total number of such lines is formula_9.\n\nSince each such line connects together formula_10 pairs of points, we thus see that at most formula_11 pairs of points can be \"j\"-connected.\n\nNow, let \"C\" be a large constant. By summing the geometric series, we see that the number of pairs of points which are \"j\"-connected for some \"j\" satisfying formula_12 is at most formula_13.\n\nOn the other hand, the total number of pairs is formula_14. Thus if we choose \"C\" to be large enough, we can find at least formula_15 pairs (for instance) which are not \"j\"-connected for any formula_12. The lines that connect these pairs either pass through fewer than 2\"C\" points, or pass through more than \"n\"/\"C\" points. If the latter case holds for even one of these pairs, then we have the first conclusion of Beck's theorem. Thus we may assume that all of the formula_17 pairs are connected by lines which pass through fewer than 2\"C\" points. But each such line can connect at most formula_18 pairs of points. Thus there must be at least formula_19 lines connecting at least two points, and the claim follows by taking formula_20.\n"}

As a child, he was often ill, suffering from a variety of conditions. In 1955, young Carl took advantage of the temporary political thaw following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, obtained a 1-month visa to West Germany and biked there, then decided to stay when he learned there that his application to Humboldt University (in East Berlin) for the study of chemistry had been turned down (because of his poor performance in mathematics). However, Otto Friedrich (a brother of Carl's father's first wife) was willing and able to help him. Two years later, he met and fell in love with Otto's niece, Matilda Friedrich, the daughter of Carl Friedrich, the political scientist and constitutional scholar. With the support of the Friedrich family, Carl emigrated to the United States in 1959, learning English on his trip across the Atlantic (he could read Beatrix Potter when he boarded the boat).\n\nHaving earned only a high school diploma after 3 and a half years of study at Hamburg University, de Boor entered Harvard as a graduate student of mathematics. After working for a year as a research assistant to Garrett Birkhoff, he went to work for General Motors Research in Warren, Michigan, where he met splines. He received his first postgraduate degree, a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, in 1966, and then became an assistant professor at Purdue University. In 1972, he accepted a position as professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, working out of the UW's Army Math Research Center, which had recently been bombed in opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nA chief attraction of the UW job was the opportunity to work directly with Isaac Schoenberg, considered the father of splines, the piecewise polynomials de Boor would further develop. In particular, he formulated a relatively fast and numerically stable algorithm for calculating the values of splines (used extensively in computer-aided design and computer graphics), and advocated for the formulation of spline functions in terms of the basis splines, or B-splines developed by Schoenberg and Curry.\nHe was a teacher, guiding numerous graduate students. He is the author of a number of works, including an introductory textbook on numerical analysis (with S.D. Conte) and a textbook on spline approximation. Carl has also worked with MATLAB extensively over the years and is the author of the Spline Toolbox.\n\nCarl de Boor retired from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2003 and relocated to the Pacific Northwest, where he continues to work with colleagues on mathematical problems, and to travel. He currently lives on Orcas Island, in Washington state, with his second wife, Helen Bee, author of numerous texts in human development, to whom he has been married since 1991. In addition to his emeritus status at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he is also an affiliated professor at the University of Washington.\n\nde Boor has been listed as an ISI Highly Cited Author in Mathematics by the ISI Web of Knowledge, Thomson Scientific Company.\n\nIn 1997 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and he received the 2003 National Medal of Science in mathematics. Other honors have included election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987 and the National Academy of Engineering in 1993, honorary degrees from Purdue University and Technion (the Israel Institute of Technology), as well as membership in the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in Germany and the Polish Academy of Science. He won the John von Neumann Lecture Prize from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 1996 and the John A. Gregory Award of Geometric Design in 2009.\n\nCarl is a lover of music—especially classical, and more especially Johann Sebastian Bach—walks, good food, and games of all sorts. \nIn 1981, he bought his first personal computer, an Apple II with 32KB of memory with an old reel-to-reel tape recorder hooked up to store programs. He required his children to write any computer games they wished to play. With them he wrote an accounting program for tracking his checkbook, which he kept using long after the kids went to college, though he had to edit the program to use the Z key for recording a new transaction when the R key finally wore out, as well as implementations of a number of his children's favorite board games.\n\nHe is a lover of the quirky and easily enthralled by art. He used to keep a print of The Garden of Earthly Delights in his dining room, to the distress of some of his children, and others.\n\nCarl learned to play the cornet, as a child, to combat asthma. He was also fed a vast quantity of raw eggs, whipped with a sprinkle of sugar, supposedly to help strengthen him during his early, sickly years. As a father, he made his children eat such egg treats.\n\nDuring his Madison years, he played the bass drum in the neighborhood Fourth of July parade, and each August celebrates his arrival in the United States, where he is a citizen.\n\n\nSelected publications by Carl de Boor:\n"}

An original video animation, \"Burst Angel Infinity\", was released on March 23, 2007. The music for both the series and OVA was composed by Masara Nishida.\n\nIn the near future, due to an unusual rise in criminal activity, it has become legal to possess firearms in Japan so lawful citizens can protect themselves. At the same time, the government established the Recently Armed Police of Tokyo, whose methods are exterminating criminals rather than arresting them.\n\nThe story opens with Kyohei Tachibana, a student at a culinary arts school with dreams of someday becoming a pastry chef, motorcycling down an inner city street and becoming caught up in a shoot-out between a mysterious silver-haired woman and a psycho gangster. Kyohei escapes unharmed and ends up working as a cook for Jo, Meg, Amy, and Sei in an effort to gather up enough money to travel to France. The girls, ranging in ages of eleven to nineteen, turn out to be pseudo-mercenary agents for a larger international group known as Bailan. \n\n\"Burst Angel\" focuses on the group as they investigate a series of mutated human monsters with glowing brains that cause various amounts of mayhem in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete collection of DVDs from Funimation have been released as of January 2, 2009.

It was first described in 1942.\n\nWeddellite, or calcium oxalate dihydrate, crystallises in a tetragonal system: the classic crystal shape is the eight-face bipyramid. Using bright field microscopy, the weddellite crystals are recognised easily by their shape, reminiscent of a postal envelope. More complex shapes of weddellite are possible; the dumbbell shape is not rare and has no precise angles or sides. This form is, in reality, a microcrystalline agglomerate that takes the shape of a biconcave disc. Weddellite crystals are poorly birefringent and do not show any interference pattern under polarised light.\n\nWeddellite crystals are usually of little clinical value.

His first race for the team was the 2010 1000 km of Algarve, finishing fourth overall and winning the LMP2 class. He remained with the team for the next round, the 2010 1000 km of Hungaroring, where they finished fourth in both class and overall.\n\nCollins competed in the final meeting of the 2010 Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship, driving a BMW for the Motorbase Performance team. He finished his first race in 14th and bettered that with a 12th in his second. However he retired in the third and he never returned the following season.\n\nCollins is a regular writer for \"Autosport Magazine\" testing the latest racing cars, has written for \"The Sunday Times\", fronted Sky Sports' televised NASCAR coverage, along with appearances on the British car-focused television programmes \"Top Gear\" (BBC Two), \"Pulling Power\" (ITV1) and \"driven\" (Channel 4).\n\nHe worked as a precision-driver in the film \"\" where he doubled for the actor Nicolas Cage and drove in some of the high-speed sequences in London. As a precision-driver in the 2008-film \"Quantum of Solace\", Collins drove James Bond's Aston Martin DBS as a stunt double for Daniel Craig in the lead role. He has also worked as a stunt driver on Skyfall and Spectre.\n\nHe also holds a World Record for the maximum distance of driving a car on two wheels (a manoeuvre called \"skiing\").\n\nCollins presented television programme \"Xtreme Teen Drivers\", shown on BBC Three on 15 December 2007; as an advanced driving instructor within the programme, he was trying to teach a young boy racer to drive more safely.\n\nCollins' company Ben Collins Auto-sport has provided its logistics and third-party liability insurance for prize-winner track day events promoted by \"Top Gear\" magazine.\n\nCollins has appeared on the popular BBC television programme \"Top Gear\" as himself, with his company providing drivers and driving services since December 2003. In Series 2 Episode 10, Collins appeared as one member of \"BBC Top Gear\"-team in the 24-hour Citroën 2CV racing event. The team finished thirteenth, out of thirty four cars, 24 laps behind the leaders, with Collins setting the fastest lap.\n\nIn 2004, Collins made an appearance during the fourth series of \"Top Gear\", alongside parachutist Tim Carter. The stunt involved Carter and an aerial cameraman jumping out of a Cessna light aircraft then landing in the open-topped Mercedes car being driven at a speed by Collins. The open-top car was introduced as belonging to Collins and had earlier been used, driven by The Stig, during a wig test in Series 3 Episode 5.\n\nIn 2004, the driver featured during series five, driving a Lancer Evo VII and then a Bowler Wildcat vehicle in a rally race against mountain boarding world champion Tom Kirkman\n\nAt the start of series six, Collins appeared with other British Touring Car Championship racing and stunt drivers for a Five-a-side football game using a fleet of Toyota Aygo cars. Collins played in a team captained by \"Top Gear\" presenter Richard Hammond. The other drivers were Paul Swift, Tim Harvey and Tom Chilton (blue team); playing against James May, Russ Swift, Matt Neal, Dan Eaves and Rob Huff (red team).\n\nCollins could be seen driving the Honda Civic Type-R against Jeremy Clarkson in Episode 6 of Series 10.\n\nThe sixth episode of series seventeen of \"Top Gear\" featured a team of amputee soldiers training driving a Bowler Wildcat and being trained by Collins to take part in the Dakar Rally.\n\nCollins also appeared in the Top Gear Special, '50 Years of Bond Cars', on the set of Skyfall. Collins, who worked as a stunt driver on the film was interviewed by Richard Hammond.\n\nOn a separate occasion, following an accident involving Richard Hammond in September 2006, the Health & Safety Executive report into the event recorded that Collins had \"worked closely with \"Top Gear\" as a high-performance driver and consultant\" and had prepared a briefing for Richard Hammond preceding the event.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" ran a story claiming that they had \"outed\" Collins as being one of the people behind the white-suit incarnation of The Stig, at the same time noting that \"Collins, from Bristol, has always denied being the Stig\".\n\n\"The Times\", in a follow-up article, stated that the \"identity of the white-suited Stig ... has been an open secret within the motoring world for some years, with newspapers refraining from publishing his name, to uphold the spirit of the programme\" which concluded that \"a newspaper broke with the convention to out Mr Collins, 33, after following up a story in a Bristol newspaper\".\nSimilar allegations were repeated by \"The Sunday Times\" during August 2010.\n\nTwo Bristol-based local newspapers had published articles a week before \"The Times\" in January 2009, on the basis of information leaked from a local art gallery. Collins had previously commissioned a Clifton-based business in September 2008, to produce a limited-edition run of poster prints. Collins had initially portrayed himself as a BBC marketing executive and only confirmed a more detailed connection to the \"Top Gear\" show after the signing of confidentiality agreements by the business owners.\nThe signed poster image showed a salt flat scene, with The Stig positioned standing on it.\n\nHowever, at the time \"Top Gear\" presenter James May claimed that the Stig's identity had not been outed. There had been speculation that there may have been more than one person who plays the Stig.\n\nDuring August to September 2010 the BBC started legal proceedings against Harper Collins, with the BBC attempting to obtain a High Court injunction to prevent the publishing of a book entitled \"The Man in The White Suit\", apparently authored by Collins. The injunction was quashed by the High Court, allowing the possibility of the book being published on its intended release date of 16 September 2010 in the United Kingdom and 1 October 2010 in Australia.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \"WitneyTV\" recorded on 3 September 2010 and broadcast on 7 September 2010, \"Top Gear\"-presenter Jeremy Clarkson confirmed that Collins had worked as The Stig, and that Collins was \"history as far as we're concerned, he's sacked\". On 7/8 September 2010, \"The Guardian\", \"The Sun\" and other papers re-reported Clarkson's assertions in the interview that Collins had been fired from his role on the television show.\n\nIn the fifteenth series Christmas special, \"Top Gear\" presenters referred to the Stig as \"The Splitter\" and publicly ridiculed the Stig, using the picture of the Stig for drive-by shooting targets.\n\nDuring Collins' appearance with the military amputees broadcast in July 2011, Collins was introduced and acknowledged by \"Top Gear\"-presenter Richard Hammond as \"ex-Stig ... Ben Collins\". Though Hammond still referred to Collins as a \"romantic novelist\", he said that \"to be honest, [he was] quite glad to see 'the old Splitter' back, and [he does] know how much giving these guys a hand means to him. So this is all right.\"\n\nIn his appearance in the \"Top Gear\" Special, '50 Years of Bond Cars', Collins was wearing a T-shirt on which was printed the words, \"I AM THE STIG.\" Richard Hammond, (who interviewed Collins) reacted, saying to him, \"Nice T-shirt by the way.\" Collins admitted that he needs to \"update that a bit\", pointing to the word \"AM\", to which Hammond exclaimed, \"Was.\" After hearing about some of what Collins had been doing for the film, Hammond remarked, \"You should write a book.\"\n\nCollins joined the presenting staff of Channel 5's \"Fifth Gear\" in Series 18, participating in racing challenges on several occasions. He did not return to the cast for Series 19.\n\nFollowing his departure from \"Top Gear\", Collins has subsequently appeared on the \"Top Gear Live\" touring show. He appeared onstage in a show in Poland and also served as a racing driver for at least one pre-recorded clip. Introducing him, Clarkson joked Collins' was \"living rough\", in a racing track paddock, as Collins was shown to be sleeping on cardboard with a shopping trolley with books and Daniel Craig face cuttouts for his possessions. Collins' role was identical to his previous one as the Stig, except wearing an open face helmet and he was referred to as \"The Ben Collins\" by Clarkson. He has written a second book, \"How To Drive: The Ultimate Guide, from the Man Who Was The Stig,\" published in 2014.\n\nCollins served as a consultant during the development of Project CARS and Project CARS 2.\n\nIn 2007 Collins started a career as a stunt driver in the Nicolas Cage movie \"National Treasure 2.\" This followed by multiple films for the James Bond franchise and other blockbusters including \"Dark Knight Rises\", \"Han Solo: A Star Wars Story\", \"Jack Ryan\", and \"Mission Impossible.\" He had a dual role as a stunt driver and actor in \"Ford v Ferrari / Le Mans '66\" in the role of Denny Hulme \n\n"}

{"id": "2082836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082836", "title": "Maryland Route 5", "text": "Maryland Route 5\n\nMaryland Route 5 (MD 5) is a long state highway that runs north–south in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from Point Lookout in St. Mary's County north to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland, Prince George's County. MD 5 begins as the two-lane undivided Point Lookout Road which runs from Point Lookout, St. Mary's County, to an intersection with MD 235 in the northern part of the county. Point Lookout Road passes through rural areas as well as the county seat of Leonardtown. After the MD 235 intersection, the route becomes the four-lane divided Three Notch Road and continues into Charles County, where it becomes Leonardtown Road. Here, the route bypasses Hughesville and continues north toward the Waldorf area, which it bypasses to the east on Mattawoman Beantown Road. The route merges onto U.S. Route 301 (US 301, Crain Highway) and enters Prince George's County, splitting from US 301 at an interchange in Brandywine. From here, MD 5 continues north on Branch Avenue, running through suburban areas, before becoming a freeway as it passes Andrews Air Force Base and interchanges with Interstate 95 (I-95)/I-495 (Capital Beltway). Past the Capital Beltway, the route runs through suburban areas of Hillcrest Heights and Suitland before reaching the D.C. border, where Branch Avenue SE continues, crossing Pennsylvania Avenue SE and eventually terminating at Randle Circle.\n\nMD 5 was designated in 1927 to run from Point Lookout to the Washington, D.C. border in Suitland. The route was realigned to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. line in 1939, while MD 637 was designated along the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border. Between 1939 and 1949, the route continued into Washington, D.C. as District of Columbia Route 5 (DC 5), which followed Naylor Road SE, Good Hope Road SE, 11th Street SE, and DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue) to US 1 and US 240 near the White House. MD 5 was realigned to head to the Washington, D.C. border along Branch Avenue in 1950. During the course of the 1950s and 1960s, most of MD 5 between the MD 235 intersection and the Washington, D.C. border was widened into a divided highway. In 1993, the route bypassed Leonardtown; the original alignment was designated MD 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) before it was decommissioned in 2012. In 1997, MD 5 was realigned to bypass Waldorf to the east along what had been designated as MD 205 in 1989. The former alignment through Waldorf followed what is now MD 5 Bus. and US 301. In Prince George's County, multiple interchanges were built along MD 5 between MD 223 and the Capital Beltway in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, a four-lane, divided bypass of Hughesville was completed, alleviating the traffic bottleneck within that town at the intersection of MD 231. The former alignment through Hughesville became MD 5 Bus. The portion of MD 5 between US 301 and the Capital Beltway is slated to be upgraded to a full freeway, with an interchange at MD 373 (Accokeek Road)/Brandywine Road completed and the remainder of the freeway upgrade still in the planning stages.\n\nMD 5 begins within Point Lookout State Park in St. Mary's County by heading west on Point Lookout Road, a two-lane undivided road which continues south from the route’s southern terminus along the shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay to the confluence with the Potomac River. The route turns north, passing a fee booth for the park at the entrance before continuing into wooded areas. A short distance later, the road makes a left turn and heads northwest through a mix of woodland and farmland. MD 5 passes through Scotland and continues north through more agricultural areas with intermittent residences. It reaches Ridge, where MD 5 intersects the southern terminus of MD 235 (Three Notch Road). From here, the road heads into more wooded areas. MD 5 passes through agricultural and residential areas before turning northwest and entering St. Mary's City. Here, the route makes a turn to the north, with MD 584 looping to the west of the route through the center of St. Mary's City. The road runs long the shore of the St. Marys River and passes near St. Mary's College of Maryland before leaving St. Mary's City had heading into forested areas. It reaches Park Hall, where MD 5 intersects MD 489 (Park Hall Road).\n\nPast MD 489, the route turns to the west and heads through a mix of woods, farms, and homes. It heads to Great Mills, where it briefly becomes a divided highway at the intersection with MD 246 (Great Mills Road). From here, MD 5 continues west to an intersection with MD 471 (Indian Bridge Road). Past this intersection, MD 5 continues to Callaway. Here, the route intersects MD 249 (Piney Point Road). It passes some businesses before heading into wooded areas with residences. The route turns north, passing through Redgate, before heading toward Leonardtown.\n\nUpon reaching Leonardtown, MD 5 passes between Leonardtown High School and the Dr. James A. Forrest Career and Technology Center to the west and the St. Mary's County Fairgrounds to the east before it intersects MD 244 (Medleys Neck Road). Following this, the road reaches a junction with MD 4 (St. Andrews Church Road). Past this intersection, the route becomes a divided highway again, entering Leonardtown, where it heads northeast of St. Mary's Ryken High School and Fenwick Street heads west toward the downtown area. MD 5 heads northwest through woodland before passing by the Leonardtown campus of the College of Southern Maryland. Past the college, the road intersects MD 245 (Hollywood Road) and Washington Street. The road widens to four lanes and heads through a mix of residences and businesses, passing near MedStar St. Mary's Hospital. It leaves Leonardtown and becomes a divided highway at the intersection with MD 243 (Newtowne Neck Road). MD 5 passes commercial areas before heading into farmland at the intersection with MD 234 (Budds Creek Road).\n\nFrom here, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road again. It heads north through a mix of farm fields and residences, eventually coming to an intersection with MD 247 (Loveville Road) in Loveville. The Loveville area is home to several farms belonging to an Old Order Mennonite community. MD 5 turns northwest, heading through woodland and reaching Morganza, where the route intersects MD 242 (Colton Point Road). The road heads west through a mix of woods and farms to Helen, where MD 5 comes to an intersection with MD 238 (Chaptico Road). Here, the route turns north, with residential neighborhoods increasing along the road as it continues through rural areas. The route passes east of a park and ride lot before it comes to another intersection with MD 235 (Three Notch Road) in Oraville, where MD 5 makes a left turn onto Three Notch Road, a four-lane divided highway. The route heads northwest through a mix of rural residences and businesses, with the median widening briefly to include some businesses when the route reaches Mechanicsville. The road continues through rural commercial areas before reaching Charlotte Hall. Here, the median widens again and MD 5 intersects MD 236 (Thompson Corner Road) and MD 6 (New Market Turner Road). From here, the median narrows again as the route turns to the north and continues through a mix of farms and woods with some businesses, passing to the east of the St. Mary's County Welcome Center. Farther north, MD 863 loops off to the east of MD 5 and serves a farmers market. The area around Mechanicsville and Charlotte Hall is home to several Amish farms and businesses.\n\nMD 5 crosses into Charles County, where it continues north on Leonardtown Road through areas of rural residences. The route reaches Hughesville, where MD 5 bypasses the community to the east on a limited-access highway and MD 5 Bus. (MD 625) continues to the north through Hughesville on Old Leonardtown Road. The bypass heads through wooded areas before coming to a dumbbell interchange with MD 231 (Prince Frederick Road) that features roundabouts where the ramps meet MD 231. Past MD 231, the bypass continues through woodland before intersecting MD 5 Business again. From here, MD 5 heads northwest through a mix of woods and farms with some residences and businesses. The route turns to the west and passes through Bryantown, where it intersects Olivers Shop Road/Bryantown Road intersection.\n\nThe road turns to the northwest past Bryantown and heads through wooded areas, passing through Zekiah Swamp. MD 5 comes to an intersection with MD 488 (La Plata Road) and turns north again, heading through a mix of woods, farms, and residences. The route heads through wooded residential neighborhoods before it heads back into farmland. The route reaches the eastern edge of the planned community of St. Charles, where it comes to an intersection where St. Charles Parkway heads south into St. Charles, MD 5 Business heads to the west on Leonardtown Road, and MD 5 turns north onto Mattawoman Beantown Road.\n\nMD 5 follows Mattawoman Beantown Road, a four-lane divided highway that bypasses the center of Waldorf to the east. The route intersects Poplar Hill Road, which leads to the house of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd. Mattawoman Beantown Road carries MD 5 north through farm fields before heading into woodland, passing west of a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses. It continues into suburban residential areas of Waldorf, passing by the entrance to the Pinefield neighborhood, which used to be intertwined with several Nike Missile installations. The route crosses over CSX's Popes Creek Subdivision before coming to an intersection with US 301 (Crain Highway). This intersection has no direct access from northbound MD 5 to southbound US 301, with access provided by Mattawoman Road. Here, MD 5 forms a concurrency with US 301 and continues north as a six-lane divided highway.\n\nThe Crain Highway crosses the Mattawoman Creek into Prince George's County, where it heads north through wooded areas with some businesses along the road. US 301 splits from MD 5 at an interchange near Brandywine with MD 5 continuing to the north on four-lane divided Branch Avenue. A short distance past US 301, the route comes to an interchange that connects to Brandywine Road and MD 373 (Accokeek Road), where it briefly widens to six lanes. It continues north as a four-lane divided highway through woodland with some businesses and adjacent residential areas before passing by the Southern Maryland Hospital Center at the Surratts Road intersection. Past Surratts Road, the route heads through suburban residential areas of Clinton as a six-lane road before turning into a freeway that comes to a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with MD 223 (Woodyard Road).\n\nThe route heads northwest through commercial areas, with interchanges located at Malcolm Road (MD 5M)/Schultz Road and Coventry Way (MD 5L), the latter being a single-point urban interchange. The route has a southbound exit to Old Branch Avenue and a northbound entrance from Old Alexandria Ferry Road before it turns north and heads through wooded surroundings, forming the western boundary of Andrews Air Force Base. MD 5 comes to another SPUI with MD 337 (Allentown Road) in Camp Springs. A short distance later, the road interchanges with Manchester Drive (MD 5R)/Linda Lane (MD 5Q) before heading north as a freeway to an interchange with I-95/I-495 (Capital Beltway).\nPast the Capital Beltway, MD 5 meets MD 535A (Auth Road) at a northbound right-in/right-out intersection; MD 535A provides access to northbound MD 5 from southbound I-95/I-495 as well as from northbound MD 5 to the Branch Avenue station at the terminus of Washington Metro's Green Line. The route continues northwest into commercial areas, coming to a southbound left exit and left entrance with Woods Way that serves Branch Avenue station before it becomes a surface road again and intersects MD 967C (Simpson Road)/Auth Way and MD 967A (Old Branch Avenue). The route narrows to four lanes and turns west, coming to an interchange with MD 414 (St. Barnabas Road) in Marlow Heights. MD 5 turns to the northwest past this interchange, passing by the Marlow Heights Shopping Center and continuing to Hillcrest Heights, where the route intersects MD 458 (Silver Hill Road) adjacent to The Shops at Iverson.\n\nThe route passes more businesses and heads toward Suitland, where it intersects MD 414 (Bonita Street) again. The road continues north to an intersection with MD 637 (Naylor Road). North of Naylor Road, the route passes under the Green Line of the Washington Metro east of the Naylor Road station, has an interchange with the Suitland Parkway, and narrows to a 2-lane undivided road in quick succession. MD 5 passes through wooded areas before coming to an intersection with Southern Avenue SE at the Washington, D.C. border where the route ends and Branch Avenue SE continues into the District of Columbia toward Pennsylvania Avenue SE.\n\nIn 1911, the road between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border was completed as a state highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, the entire length of the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road.\n\nMD 5 was designated in 1927 to the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border was designated as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road SE, Good Hope Road SE, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue SE). By this time, the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along Pennsylvania Avenue to US 1 and US 240 at the east side of the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned.\n\nIn 1950, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Branch Avenue to the Washington, D.C. border, replacing MD 637; MD 637 was designated onto Naylor Road between MD 5 and the Washington, D.C. border by 1966. In addition, the route was widened into a divided highway along the US 301 concurrency between the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB and along Branch Avenue between south of the Henson Creek and the Washington, D.C. border. MD 5 was upgraded from a bituminous to a paved road between St. Mary's City and Great Mills in 1953. The same year, the portion of route along the US 301 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border was widened into a divided highway. MD 5 was relocated to a new alignment to the east between TB and north of Camp Springs in 1956, with a northward extension of MD 381 designated onto the former alignment. This section of MD 381, called Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue, was transferred to county maintenance in 1965. In 1959, MD 5 was paved between south of St. Inigoes and St. Mary's City. A year later, the remainder of the route south to Point Lookout was paved. In 1962, MD 5 was widened into a divided highway between south of Newmarket and the St. Mary's-Charles county border and between MD 223 in Clinton and Camp Springs. An interchange was built at the northern terminus of the US 301 concurrency in 1963. The route was upgraded to a divided highway in the Beantown area in 1964. In 1965, MD 5 was improved to a divided highway between MD 235 and south of Newmarket. The divided highway was extended south from Beantown to the MD 488 intersection in 1966. In 1967, the route was widened into a divided highway between the St. Mary's-Charles county border and MD 488 with the exception of the portion through Hughesville. MD 5 was upgraded to a divided highway between US 301 and MD 223 in 1969. An interchange was constructed at MD 414 in 1970.\n\nMD 5 was routed to bypass Leonardtown by 1993, with the former route becoming MD 5 Bus. During the 1990s and early 2000s, multiple interchanges were constructed along MD 5 in Prince George's County. In 1992, an interchange was built at MD 223. The interchange with MD 337 was built in 1996. In 1999, an interchange was constructed at Coventry Way. In 2001, an interchange was constructed with Manchester Drive and Linda Lane in Camp Springs.\nWhat is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was constructed as a gravel road by 1927. This road was designated part of MD 233. In 1956, MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part of what had been MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown. MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989. That same year, MD 205 was assigned to the westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two-lane Mattawoman–Beantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman. The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997. The portion of MD 5 from what had been MD 205's southern terminus west to US 301 became MD 5 Bus.\n\nIn February 2007, a $56 million limited-access bypass around Hughesville was completed, redirecting MD 5 to the east of the community. The bypass was built due to the heavy amount of congestion at the old intersection of MD 5 and MD 231 in Hughesville's central business district. Groundbreaking for construction of the bypass took place on November 5, 2004, with $10 million in federal funds given to the project. The old portion of MD 5 that went through Hughesville received the official MD 625 designation in 2006, even though it is signed as MD 5 Bus. The bypass was formally opened on August 8, 2007.\n\nThere are plans to improve MD 5 in Prince George's County due to traffic congestion along the route. An interchange was built with MD 373 and Brandywine Road in Brandywine that also widened the route to six lanes in the vicinity of the interchange. Construction of Phase 1, which widened MD 5 to 6 lanes in the vicinity of the interchange, began in November 2009 and was completed in August 2011. Phase 2, which will build the interchange itself, went through the design phase, with construction beginning in 2016 and be completed in 2020. On February 4, 2019, the intersection with MD 5 and Brandywine Road was replaced with a bridge over MD 5 at the new interchange. In addition, the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road/Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road. This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway, adding reversible lanes or high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and various interchange designs.\n\nMaryland Route 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) was a business route of MD 5 that looped through the central part of Leonardtown. The route headed west from MD 5 on Fenwick Street, a two-lane undivided road with a traffic count of 7,271 vehicles in 2007. It headed through wooded areas before it reached into the downtown area of Leonardtown. Upon reaching the town center, MD 5 Bus. turned north onto Washington Street, which followed a one-way pair with two lanes in each direction. The road turned into a four-lane undivided road and continued through residential and commercial areas before intersecting MD 5 again. Past here, the road becomes MD 245 (Hollywood Road). The route was decommissioned in 2012 when it was transferred from the state to the town of Leonardtown. Despite being decommissioned, some signs still remain for the route.\n\nMaryland Route 5 Business (MD 5 Bus., officially MD 625 in MDSHA internal documents) is a business route that was designated in 2006 along the former alignment of MD 5 in Hughesville after that route was moved to the Hughesville Bypass. The route heads north from MD 5 south of Hughesville on Old Leonardtown Road, a two-lane undivided road with a traffic count of 3,458 vehicles in 2007. It passes a mix of residences and farm fields before becoming a four-lane undivided road and passing businesses in the center of Hughesville, where the route crosses MD 231 (Prince Frederick Road). Past this intersection, the route passes more businesses before narrowing to two lanes and ending at MD 5 north of Hughesville.\nMaryland Route 5 Business (MD 5 Bus.) is a business route that runs along Leonardtown Road between MD 5 in St. Charles and US 301 in Waldorf. The route heads west from MD 5 (Mattawoman Beantown Road) and St. Charles Parkway as a four-lane divided highway with a traffic count of 29,430 vehicles in 2007. The route passes north of Thomas Stone High School before it heads into commercial areas. The median ends and MD 5 Bus. gains a center left-turn lane. It crosses CSX’s Popes Creek Subdivision before coming to an intersection with MD 925 (Old Washington Road). A short distance later, MD 5 Bus. becomes a divided highway again and ends at US 301 (Crain Highway), where the road continues west as MD 228 (Berry Road).\n\n"}

The necessary parts are then fashioned out of a suitable material, such as wood, plastic, plaster, clay, metal, polymer clay, or even paper, and then assembled. Some purists consider a model not to be truly scratchbuilt unless all of the parts were made from raw materials. However most modellers would consider a model including commercial detail parts as scratchbuilt. Scratchbuilding a new body onto an altered ready-to-run chassis is also acceptable.\n\nThe reasons hobbyists scratchbuild may vary. Often a desired model is unavailable in kit form in the desired scale, or entirely non-existent. Sometimes the hobbyist may be dissatisfied with the accuracy or detail of kits that are available. Other times a hobbyist will opt to scratchbuild simply for the challenge. Less frequently a hobbyist will scratchbuild out of economy, as often the raw materials cost less than a packaged commercial kit.\n\nMost hobbyists develop their skills by building kits, then progress to kitbashing, where various kits are combined to create a unique model before attempting to scratchbuild. Sometimes scratchbuilders utilize discarded parts of other models or toys, with or without modification, either in order to speed up the building process or to allow the process to continue in spite of certain parts being difficult to make. Some companies sell parts that are of little use to anyone but scratchbuilders.\n\nBuilding stock, in whichever material, can be plain sheets, strips, bars, tubes, rods, or even structural shapes such as L or T girders. Stock can also be embossed or textured to replicate a certain prototype material (such as plastic sheet embossed with grooves to mimic a scale brick wall).\n\nFor example, to scratch-build a small board fence, the modeler could use plastic rod stock to form the vertical posts, then use plastic bar stock to form horizontal rails affixed to the posts, lay plastic strip stock vertically on the horizontal rails (perhaps 'distressed' with a wire brush to mimic wood grain, or by using thin strips of actual wood), trimming the top and bottoms of the strips to be even, adding details like nail holes (using a small pin), and then finishing and weathering (making a model look like it has been used via dust, dirt, stains, and wear).\n\nThere are as many ways of scratch-building models as there are modelers, but generally the modeler obtains plans of a prototype, or designs his own, transfers these plans to paper or other material as patterns (much easier since the arrival of household computer printers and copiers), and uses these patterns to cut, trim and affix the stock together to form the model. Finishing work (such as sanding and polishing, painting, weathering, distressing by forming dents and rust, dust, etc.) is done to complete the model and (hopefully) bring it to a lifelike state.\n"}

Their native language is called Deg Xinag. They reside in Alaska along the Anvik River in Anvik, along the Innoko River in Shageluk, and at Holy Cross along the lower Yukon River. \n\nThe Deg Hitʼan are members of the federally recognized Alaska Native tribes of Anvik Village, Shageluk Native Village, and Holy Cross Village. The Iditarod Trail's antecedents were the native trails of the Dena'ina and Deg Hitʼan Athabaskan Indians and the Inupiaq Eskimos.\n\nTheir neighbors are other Athabaskan-speaking and Yupik Eskimo peoples: Yup'ik (west and south), Holikachuk (north), Upper Kuskokwim (north and east), and Dena'ina (south).\n\nThe autonyms used by this group of Athabaskan people are: Deg Xitʼan (local people) and Deg Xinag (local language). Sometimes the \"Deg Xitʼan\" or \"Deg Hitʼan\" is used for the language in English. Deg Hitʼan rather than Deg Xitʼan is a somewhat unfortunate spelling choice. Xitʼan is the orthographic representation of /χətʼan/ \"people of (area)\", a nominalized verb form. There is no contrast between /χ/ and /h/ in the verb prefixes of Deg Xinag, and acoustic evidence indicates that the normative pronunciation in that context is [χ] rather than [h]. \n\nThe most common older name is Ingalik (from Yup'ik \"Ingqiliq\" «traditionally Athabaskan; now also any other Indian», literally «having louse's eggs» < \"ingqiq\" «nit, louse nit, egg of louse» + a postbase \"-liq\" «one who is V; one who Vs; one having V; one similar to N») and its derivatives are offensive to the Deg Hitʼan.

He was also a sporting director for Verona.\n\nSomething of a footballing nomad, at club level, Toni played for twelve different Italian teams throughout his career. A late bloomer, he spent several seasons in the lower divisions of Italian football, as well as promising spells with minor Serie A clubs Vicenza and Brescia, before finally making his breakthrough with Palermo: he helped the team to Serie A promotion during the 2003–04 season by winning the Serie B title, and was the league's top scorer with 30 goals; the following season, he helped the club qualify for Europe, scoring 20 goals in Serie A. After two prolific seasons with Fiorentina, Toni also spent three seasons with German side Bayern Munich, where he helped the club to a domestic treble during the 2007–08 season, also reaching the UEFA Cup semi-finals; after falling out with the club's manager during his third season with the team, and being demoted to the reserve squad, he later returned to Italy on loan with Roma in 2010, and subsequently had spells with Genoa and Juventus. In 2012, he played for Al-Nasr Dubai SC, in the UAE Arabian Gulf League, but returned to Fiorentina for a season later that year. He retired in 2016, after three seasons with Verona, the last as team captain.\n\nAt international level, he represented the Italian national team on 47 occasions, scoring 16 goals. He made his international debut in 2004 and took part at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, and the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup with Italy; he most notably contributed to Italy's 2006 World Cup victory, as he scored twice and was elected to the tournament's All-star team.\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Toni scored over 300 goals throughout his career, and is one of the top-five highest scoring Italians in all competitions; with 322 career goals, he is currently the fourth-highest scoring Italian player of all time. In addition to the team medals he has collected, he also won several individual honours: during his first spell with Fiorentina, he won the \"Capocannoniere\" (Serie A top scorer) award during the 2005–06 season, in which he scored 31 goals (the most goals in a Serie A season since 1958–59), which also earned him the European Golden Shoe, becoming the first Italian player ever to win the award; he was also the league's joint top scorer in the 2014–15 Serie A season, in which he became the oldest player to win the award at the age of 38, with 22 goals. Toni also finished as top scorer in the 2007–08 Bundesliga, with 24 goals, and in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, with 10 goals.\n\nToni started his professional career at Modena. This was followed by a number of seasons spent around Serie B and Serie C1 with teams such as Empoli, Fiorenzuola, and Lodigiani. After a Serie B season with Treviso in 1999, he moved to Vicenza, playing in Serie A for the first time. He then moved to Brescia, playing for two seasons under manager Carlo Mazzone, alongside Roberto Baggio and Pep Guardiola.\n\nIn 2003, he agreed to join ambitious Serie B club Palermo, being one of the main factors behind the winning team campaign that brought the \"Rosanero\" back to Serie A after over 30 years, thanks to a record 30 goals scored during the season. He consequently gained his first cap for the Italian national team in a friendly match 18 August 2004 lost 2–0 to Iceland in Reykjavík, which also marked Marcello Lippi's debut at the helm of the \"Azzurri\".\n\nIn the following season, Toni confirmed his prolificity by scoring 20 goals in Palermo's first Serie A campaign, leading the Sicilian club to a historical first qualification to the UEFA Cup.\n\nToni's move to Fiorentina was marked by controversy as the fans dubbed him a traitor for his departure. \"La Viola\" paid €10 million to sign him.\n\nDuring his first season in Florence, he scored 31 goals, making him one of the most prolific Serie A strikers of all-time (the most goals ever scored in a season being 35); this was also the first time in 50 years that a Serie A player had scored more than 30 goals. Toni was awarded the European Golden Shoe for this feat, the first Italian player to win this award. His goal scoring ability brought Fiorentina to heights never seen since the late 1990s, when Gabriel Batistuta was playing for them. They clinched fourth spot and qualified for the Champions League.\n\nThis league position, however, was revoked in the courts during the \"Calciopoli\" scandal. Italian courts recognized Fiorentina as culpable of shady dealings and convicted them to start the 2006–07 season with a 19-point deduction. Toni expressed his desire to leave the team several times during the summer to the press, but was eventually convinced by club President Andrea Della Valle to stay and help the club overcome its unfavourable position.\n\nThe following season was plagued by injury, limiting Toni's goals to a less considerable, albeit impressive, 16 goals. This was Toni's final season at the Florence club, as they agreed to sell him to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. Before he left, Toni promised Della Valle not to sign for any big Italian clubs, which is believed to be the main reason he went to Germany.\n\nOn 30 May 2007, Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed that Toni had signed a four-year contract with the club after agreeing to a deal worth €11.58 million with Fiorentina. On 7 June, Toni was presented at a Bayern press conference along with fellow new signing Franck Ribéry. Toni was given the number 9 shirt.\n\nToni scored four goals in a 19 December 6–0 home win against Aris of Greece to help Bayern win their UEFA Cup group. On 17 February 2008, he scored his first Bundesliga hat-trick (a \"perfect hat-trick\": a goal with each foot and a header, all coming in one half) against Hannover 96. Bayern won the away fixture 3–0.\n\nIn a quarter-final second leg match in the UEFA Cup, Toni scored two dramatic goals on 115th and 120th minutes of extra time, in a game which finished 3–3 and lifted Bayern Munich past Getafe CF of Spain on away goals. Bayern eventually lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg in the semi-final. At the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, he shared the first place with Pavel Pogrebnyak from Zenit at the top scorers list with 10 goals.\n\nHe scored two goals in the German Cup final against Borussia Dortmund in a 2–1 win; his second goal was the winner in extra time to give Bayern Munich another cup victory. Toni finished as top scorer in the 2007–08 Bundesliga season with 24 goals. Overall, Toni finished the season with 39 goals and 12 assists in 46 matches.\nIn the 2008–09 season, Toni maintained his high-standard of form for Bayern. In the Bundesliga, he started 13 games from January, in which he scored nine goals, a notable one being a late stoppage-time winner he scored against TSG Hoffenheim.\n\nToni battled an Achilles tendon injury for most of the second half of the 2008–09 season, but still finished as Bayern's leading scorer in league play, tallying 14 goals in 25 Bundesliga appearances.\n\nRecovering from his injury he appeared in two matches of the second team Bayern Munich II in the 3. Liga in September 2009.\n\nOn 7 November 2009, he was fined for leaving the stadium during the match after being substituted at half-time.\n\nFollowing his fall out with Bayern manager Louis van Gaal, Bayern's President, Uli Hoeneß, stated on \"DSF Doppelpass\" that Toni would be allowed to leave the club on a free transfer. Eventually, Toni, by mutual agreement with Bayern, was loaned out to Italian club A.S. Roma.\n\nOn 31 December 2009, Bayern Munich confirmed the transfer of the Italian striker on a six-month loan basis to Roma, which offered him pre-tax basic salary of €3.1 million. He debuted for Roma against Cagliari on 6 January 2010. He scored his first two goals for Roma against Genoa on 17 January 2010 (for 2–0 and 3–0). Toni would go on to score five goals in total for the \"Giallorossi\" during the remainder of the 2009–10 season, including the winner against Internazionale to cut the Milanese club's lead in \"Serie A\" to a single point ahead of Roma.\n\nOn 16 June 2010, Bayern announced the termination of Toni's contract. In the same month, after some days of speculation, it was confirmed that Luca Toni had found an agreement with Genoa for a two-year contract, reportedly at a net salary of €4 million per season, as subsequently confirmed by club Chairman Enrico Preziosi. The player, who was presented to the press on 1 July, took on the number 9 jersey.\n\nOn 7 January 2011, a statement in the Juventus official website announced that Luca Toni would be joining Juventus on a free transfer deal, until 30 June 2012. Toni scored his 100th goal in Serie A with a header from 16 meters against Cagliari, which was also his debut goal for Juventus. Toni also scored the first goal at the new Juventus Stadium against Notts County on 8 September 2011.\n\nOn 30 January 2012, Juventus confirmed that they have agreed a deal for Luca Toni with Emirati club Al Nasr.\n\nOn 31 August 2012, in the closing hour of the transfer market, Fiorentina announced that they completed the signing of Luca Toni, after he had been previously linked with a move to Siena. Toni made it a goal-scoring return for \"La Viola\" when, after coming on as a 64th-minute substitute for Adem Ljajić, he scored with his first touch the second goal in a 2–0 win over Catania in the Stadio Artemio Franchi on 16 September 2012.\n\nOn 5 July 2013, Toni signed a one-year contract with newly promoted to Serie A club Verona. On 17 August, Toni scored his first goal for Verona in a 1–0 victory over Palermo in the Coppa Italia. In his Serie A debut for the club on 24 August, Toni scored twice as Verona recorded a 2–1 home win over Milan on the opening day of the season. Toni displayed fine form for Verona and after scoring two as well as assisting a goal in successive games there were calls for him to return to the national squad with Toni stating \"I am thinking about doing well. Then it is for Cesare Prandelli to decide. For me, it would be a pleasure and an honour to go to the World Cup, but whatever happens there would be no issue\".\n\nHe ended the 2013–14 season with 20 goals, making him the second-top goalscorer in Serie A at the age of 37.\n\nDuring the 2014–15 season, he maintained a high standard of performance, scoring his 300th career goal in a 2–1 win over Udinese on 14 December 2014. He finished the season with 22 goals, which took him to the top of the Serie A goalscoring charts, along with Mauro Icardi, at the age of 38 becoming the oldest Capocannoniere in Serie A. In 2015, France Football rated him as one of the 10 best footballers in the world who are over the age of 36.\n\nToni's third season with the club was less successful, as injuries and clashes with the club's manager Luigi Delneri saw him struggle to gain form and playing time. After Verona was seen relegated from the 2015–16 Serie A season, Toni confirmed his retirement from football on 4 May 2016. He scored his last ever career goal on his final match from the penalty spot in a 2–1 home win over Serie A champions Juventus, with a Panenka style penalty, and later also started the play which led to Verona's second goal; this was his 23rd appearance and sixth goal of the league season. In the 85th minute, a visibly emotional Toni was substituted and received a standing ovation from the fans. In total, he had managed 48 league goals for Verona during his three seasons in the Italian top division with the club, 157 career Serie A goals in 344 league appearances, and a career total of 324 goals in all competitions (with 659 appearances and 306 goals at club level, and 47 appearances and 16 goals with the Italian national team). Toni explained his decision to retire after the match, stating that he would not be playing in Verona's final match of the season, in an away fixture against his former club Palermo, as he wanted to play his final career match in his team's home stadium.\n\nToni scored 16 goals in 47 appearances for the Italy national football team. He received his first international call-up in August 2004 under manager Marcello Lippi, and subsequently made his debut for the Italian national team as a substitute on 18 August 2004, in a 2–0 friendly defeat against Iceland. He scored his first international goal on 4 September 2004, after coming off the bench in a 2–1 home win against Norway, in a World Cup Qualifying match.\n\nOn 17 November, Toni made his first international start in a 1–0 friendly home win over Finland. On 11 June 2005, he captained the Italian squad for the first time in his career in a friendly match in New York against Ecuador, due to the absence of Fabio Cannavaro and other experienced players; he scored Italy's only goal in the eventual 1–1 draw. On 7 September, Toni scored his first international hat-trick in a 4–1 victory against Belarus in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, becoming the first Fiorentina player ever to do so.\nToni was selected to Italy's 23-man 2006 World Cup squad, and was given the number 9 shirt. In Italy's opening match against Ghana, he hit the crossbar as Italy won 2–0, and he later scored two goals in the quarter-finals against Ukraine on 30 June, his only goals of the tournament, as Italy won 3–0 to advance to the semi-finals against the hosts Germany. In the final against France, he hit the crossbar with a powerful header and later netted another header, although the goal was disallowed as the attempt was controversially ruled offside. Italy eventually defeated France 5–3 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw following extra-time, to win their fourth World Cup title; Toni finished the tournament as Italy's top goal-scorer, alongside Marco Materazzi, with 2 goals, also producing 20 shots and hitting the crossbar twice. He was also fouled 28 times throughout the tournament, more than other player. For his performances, Toni was named to the 2006 World Cup Team of the Tournament.\n\nOn 28 March 2007, Toni scored two goals in Italy's 2–0 home win over Scotland in a Euro 2008 qualifier. After undergoing surgery due to an injury to his left foot which he had struggled to overcome since the beginning of the 2006–07 season, he missed Italy's next two qualifiers against the Faroe Islands and Lithuania. He returned to action for his nation's qualification game against Georgia in Genoa on 13 October, and assisted Fabio Grosso, who scored Italy's second goal in a 2–0 win. On 17 November 2007, Toni struck in the first minute of a 2–1 win in a qualifying match against Scotland at Hampden Park, which secured Italy's place at the final stages of the competition. Four days later, he scored the second goal against the Faroe Islands, as Italy closed off their qualifying campaign with a 3–1 home win. He finished the qualifying round as Italy's top-scorer with 5 goals in six appearances.\n\nToni was called up to the 23-man Italian squad for UEFA Euro 2008 by manager Roberto Donadoni, but his form in the tournament was disappointing, as he failed to score; he managed a goal in Italy's second group match against Romania, but it was controversially disallowed for offside, as Italy drew the match 1–1. Toni's main contribution for the team was winning a decisive penalty kick in the final group match against France, which ended 2–0, and allowed the Italians to progress to the knock-out round. Italy then bowed out of the tournament on penalties to eventual champions Spain in the quarter-final, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time.\n\nDespite disappointing at Euro 2008, Toni was called up by returning coach Marcello Lippi for Italy's first two 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Toni also scored an equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Greece, in an international friendly on 19 November 2008, which was his final international goal. He was subsequently named to Lippi's 23-man Italy squad that took part at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa, and appeared in all three of his nation's group matches, although Italy disappointed, suffering a first-round elimination. Following the tournament, he was no longer called up to the national team, and he was not included in Lippi's provisional 30-man Italian squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup final tournament.\n\nToni's goalscoring form with Verona in 2014 saw him become a popular potential candidate for a place as a reserve in Italy's 23-man 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, although he was later excluded from Cesare Prandelli's final team for the tournament.\n\nFollowing Toni's retirement from professional football at the end of the 2015–16 season with Verona, the Italian Football Federation paid tribute to him before Italy's friendly match against Finland at the Stadio Bentegodi in Verona on 6 June 2016; he was presented with a commemorative shirt by FIGC President Carlo Tavecchio, and was awarded a city plaque by Verona's mayor, Flavio Tosi, and the town's sports councillor, Alberto Bozza.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Toni undertook a course to become a director of sport with his former club Verona. However, Verona announced that he would leave the club after his contract expired on 30 June 2017. On 15 December, he received his coaching licence. In August 2019, he enrolled in the UEFA Pro Licence courses at Coverciano.\n\nA prolific goal-scorer, Toni was a traditional centre-forward, who excelled in the air and acrobatically; although in his youth he was known for his attacking movement, which allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line or off of his teammates, he mainly operated in the penalty area in his later career, as he lost his pace and his work-rate decreased. Although naturally right footed, he was an accurate finisher with both feet, and an excellent penalty taker. Although his physical, opportunistic, \"goal-poaching\" style of play was at times criticised as unrefined and unorthodox, due to his lack of notable technical skills, he also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership and ability to utilise his height, solid first touch, and strong physique to win aerial challenges, hold up the ball for his teammates, and provide them with assists when playing with his back to goal, in addition to his ability to score goals himself. His strength, aerial prowess, and power saw him become one of the best ever headers of the ball in the Italian League.\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Tom Mason has said of his play, \"His retirement marks the end of not only a remarkable career, but of a whole breed of striker...he seems to be a relic of an out-dated and discredited ideology. In a world where forwards are the first line of defense, where high-intensity pressing and sharp bursts of energy are a prerequisite for strikers, there seems to be little room for players in the mold of Luca Toni. Ill-equipped for a fast-paced counter-attack, unlikely to trouble defenders in behind, his domain is the 18-yard box and little outside it.\" In the final season of his career, Toni was described as \"the last great Italian centre-forward\" by Italian sports newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\".\n\nThroughout his career, Toni was known for celebrating his goals by looking at his teammates and rotating his right hand next to his ear, as if to say, \"do you realise what it is I have just done?\"\n\nIn 2010, he declared to be Catholic.\n\nToni is married to Italian model Marta Cecchetto. Their son was stillborn on 1 June 2012. Their daughter Bianca was born in June 2013. On 30 July 2014, a second son, Leonardo, was born in Florence.\n\nIn March 2015, German authorities sued Toni for €1.7 million in unpaid taxes to the Catholic Church. That July, he sued his former tax adviser for the same amount, claiming that he had been registered without prior knowledge as a Roman Catholic in Germany and thus had paid taxes to the Church in conflict with his own beliefs. In December, he received a payout of €1.25 million when the court found in his favour.\n\nIn 2019, he revealed that he has center-right political ideas and that he is a supporter of Matteo Salvini, going up with him on stage during a rally in Modena.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Known as the athletic world's \"Boy Wonder\", he competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London and the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. He was born in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIn 1908, at just 19 years of age, Tait won his first round heat of the 1500 metres with a time of 4:12.2. Despite the relatively slow time (other heat winners ran as fast as 4:03.4), Tait won by nearly fifty yards. His time in the final was much quicker, at 4:06.8, and he finished in fourth place.\n\nTait also competed in the 1908 marathon and the 5 miles, failing to finish in either event.\n\nIn 1912, facing speculative news from doctors that his heart had become enlarged from eight grueling years of training and competition, Tait finished fourth in his heat of the 1500 metres, failing to qualify for the final. He also competed in the marathon, again failing to finish.\n\nOutside of the Olympics, Tait was one of the most versatile middle and long distance runners in the world, and one of the great milers of his era. In November 1907, he finished just 10 yards behind close friend and sometimes-rival Tom Longboat in the gruelling 15-mile Montreal Marathon road race, with both runners being watched in the streets by a crowd of 200,000. Tait and Longboat duelled and had the time of their young lives three times, in 1907-1908, over the famed 2.5 and 5-mile West End YMCA courses up-and-down the Dovercourt Road—with Tait beating Longboat over 5 miles in July 1907 as a 6-year old Lester Pearson watched in awe from the crowd at the finish line. Tait ran 4:05 for 1,500 metres at the 1908 Olympic Trials in Rosedale Stadium, Toronto, a Canadian record that stood until 1933. He also won a gold medal in the mile at the Festival of the Empire Sports, the first British Empire Games ever held, in London, 1911. Most importantly for him, Canada's team won the championship at Crystal Palace over Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. He was awarded both of his pure gold medals by King George V (the 'stutterer's' father). Upon returning to Toronto, his friends and teammates looked on in front of a crowd of 20,000 people outside Old City Hall, as Jack Tait sheepishly accepted a new Grandfather Clock from the mayor for his win in the mile. That evening, he received his second great reception in two years inside the Great Hall of the vaunted West End YMCA.\n\nTait also set world indoor records for 880 yards (1:54) in 1909, 1,000 yards (2:14) and 1.5 miles (6:52) in 1910, and established Canadian records at 3 and 5 miles . He remained a devoted amateur and worked throughout his athletic career, running for the West End YMCA of Toronto from 1902 to 1914. Overseeing his career during the \"Y\" days was YMCA elder and his older brother Will Tait, a coach on the 1908 Canadian Olympic Team and later manager of the Edmonton Gradettes women's basketball team from 1924 to 1936 (which served as the junior/feeder team to the world-famous Edmonton Grads). Jack Tait was also a founding member of the Balmy Beach Harriers Club in 1905, where he and other members of the West End Y and Canadian Olympic teams would set-up residence - starting in the Y's 'Marathon House' on the shores of Lake Ontario - and a full training camp all summer, near the bottom of Silver Birch Ave. and the boardwalk, in Toronto'd east-end Beach neighborhood.\n\n\"Smiling Jack\" was well-known among fellow athletes and fans throughout North America for his raw speed and talent, public sense of fair play, and for his legendary humour. After he ran his 'slowish', tactical 4:47 to win that Festival of the Empire mile championship, Tait confessed to a group of English reporters: \"I'm telling you, boys, if I'd run a mile like that in my own country I'd be shot. They actually accused me of using my brains out there today. Can you imagine?\" Funny indeed, as between 1909 and 1913 he ran the mile on four separate occasions in 4:22, almost fifty years before the 4-minute barrier was finally broken.\n\nTait counted among his close friends and teammates the likes of Mr. Longboat, Alfred Shrubb and Bobby Kerr, journalists Doug Laurie and Lou Marsh, and the great American middle distance stars Abel Kiviat, George Bonhag and Mel Shepherd. Kiviat remained the world's oldest living Olympic medalist through the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Astonishingly, after more than 60 years passed since they last saw each other, Kiviat paid tribute to his great friendship and rivalry with Tait—citing the support and encouragement he received as a naive 17 year-old from the \"older runner with the big heart\"—during a televised interview with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. All Carson asked Kiviat was: \"Of all those great athletes you were around, like Jim Thorpe, who do you remember most?\"\n\nAfter 1911 Tait also found fame as a sports reporter and columnist for the Mail and Empire, Toronto Telegram, Toronto Daily World and the Toronto Sunday World, co-founding the famous \"Yap Yaps Corner\" (a popular celebrity sports and humour column) with Mr. Laurie. From 1915-18 he served double-duty in The Great War as an artillery gunner in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and as a war correspondent for the Telegram.\n\nIn 1910, Tait ran a series of famous indoor \"match\" races against George Bonhag, the undefeated world's \"indoor king\" and multiple Olympic medalist. With North American telegraph services and newspapers hanging off every race, Tait defeated the American in 2 of 4 races held in New York City at Madison Square Garden, and in Buffalo, NY. In one of his victories, Tait beat Bonhag in the Garden one night after the two were hilariously forced to share the same bed for-rest in the afternoon, due to overcrowding in the New York Athletic Club. That evening in front of a crowd of 9,000 they both ducked under the existing world indoor record for 1.5 miles, with Tait ahead by 25 yards. He was later celebrated as a conquering hero in the Great Hall of the West End YMCA, at Queen St. and Dovercourt Road -- 'The house that Jack Built', as they called the 'West End Y' from 1904 to 1911, until the famed facility moved to Dovercourt and College St.\n\nJack Tait actually lived on Dovercourt Road in Toronto's west end during his athletic career, where from 1903-1907 his neighbors were the Rev. Edwin Pearson family. Almost fifty years later, in 1952, one of Mr. Pearson's sons, Lester Bowles Pearson—Prime Minister of Canada from 1963-1968—finally let it slip in great detail—in his first-ever interview about growing up in Toronto—that Jack Tait was his first and most profound boyhood hero. Pearson and Tait then began a memorable, hilarious correspondence by mail, telephone and telegram until 1969. From 1926 - 1971, Jack Tait and family lived at 207 Wineva Ave. in the heart of Toronto's famed Beach neighborhood.\n\nTait is also the grandfather of Paul Williams, former Canadian record holder for 3,000, 5,000 and 10,000 metres between 1979 and 1994. Williams was a three-time Olympian in 1984, 1988 and 1992, a Commonwealth Games bronze medalist (10,000 m) in 1990, Goodwill Games gold medalist over 5,000 metres (1990), and the first Canadian ever to run under 28 minutes for 10,000 metres.\n\n"}

During this time he set South African records at both the 880 yards and 1 mile. While posted to Ireland, he ran with Clonliffe Harriers and won the Irish 1 mile and 4 mile titles in 1901. Returning to England, he joined Herne Hill Harriers in 1903 and soon established a reputation as one of the country's finest cross-country runners, winning an individual bronze (1905) and team gold medals (1905, 1906 and 1908) at the International Cross Country Championships.\n\nHe finished second in the English national cross-country championships in 1907 and showed sufficient form in track races during the early part of the 1908 season to be selected to race in three events at the Olympic Games. Deakin won his first round heat of the 1500 metres event with a time of 4:13.6. Despite being one of the slowest first round winners, Deakin won by seventy-five yards.

{"id": "2082886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082886", "title": "Johann Andreas Stein", "text": "Johann Andreas Stein\n\nJohann (Georg) Andreas Stein (16 May 1728 in Heidesheim – 29 February 1792 in Augsburg), was an outstanding German maker of keyboard instruments, a central figure in the history of the piano. He was primarily responsible for the design of the so-called \"Viennese\" fortepiano, for which the piano music of Haydn, Mozart, and the early Beethoven was written.\n\nHe learned his trade in part at the Silbermann workshop in Strasbourg (1748–9), working for Johann Andreas Silbermann, nephew and pupil of the great instrument maker Gottfried Silbermann. He settled in Augsburg, where he also served as an organist.\n\nHe built not just pianos, but other keyboard instruments, some of them of novel invention. One extraordinary instrument, called the \"Poli-Toni-Clavichordium\" (1796), combined a large harpsichord having four choirs of strings (registration 8', 8', 8', 16') with a piano. He also built (1772) the \"Melodika,\" a small organ in which the player's touch could alter volume; thus it stood to regular organs much as pianos do to the harpsichord. He also built \"vis-à-vis\" instruments, with a piano and a harpsichord facing one another in a single case.\n\nToward the end of his life, Stein's business was largely taken over by his daughter Nannette (see below). Pianos with his name after 1790 are held to be Nannette's work, as Stein was himself too ill to build instruments by this date.\n\nStein's most important innovation, his piano action, was perfected around 1781. This is the so-called \"Prellmechanik\" with escapement. In this arrangement, each hammer was mounted on top of the key, with the head on the end closer to the player, a traditional arrangement in German pianos of Stein's day. The hammers were like small, asymmetrical levers, with the hammer head far from the fulcrum, and a small upward-facing hook (\"beak\") on the other side of the lever, much closer to the fulcrum. When the player depressed the key, the whole hammer assembly would rise. The beak would engage an escapement hopper attached to the keyframe. The escapement hopper pulled down on the beak as it rose, in turn causing the hammer (the other end of the lever) to fly upward and strike the string. The escapement hopper was hinged and sprung; this permitted the beak to move downward past it as the key sank back to rest position.\n\nLatcham (see Grove reference below) calls this invention \"a breakthrough in the piano's history;\" it \"offer[ed] the player a remarkable control of the hammers, especially when playing softly, and [wa]s astonishingly responsive to the player’s touch.\"\n\nStein may have been the first to produce a fully functional damper pedal, in which the player can lift all the dampers from the strings. Such a device had been devised by Stein's predecessor Gottfried Silbermann, but Silbermann's device required the use of the player's hands to work, and thus could only be deployed during pauses in the music. Stein's device was controlled by a knee lever, pushing upward on the lower surface of the instruments, permitting the full equivalent of modern piano pedaling.\n\nMozart visited and befriended Stein in Augsburg in 1777, during the (unsuccessful) job-hunting tour that took him also to Mannheim and Paris. The enthusiastic letter that Mozart wrote to his father Leopold is informative concerning Stein and Mozart's own preferences in pianos. The letter is very widely quoted. The following translation, by Emily Anderson, is taken from Broder 1941:\nThis time I shall begin at once with Stein's pianofortes. Before I had seen any of his make, Späth's claviers had always been my favourites. But now I much prefer Stein's, for they damp ever so much better than the Regensburg instruments. ... In whatever way I touch the keys, the tone is always even. It never jars, it is never stronger or weaker or entirely absent; in a word, it is always even. It is true that he does not sell a pianoforte of this kind for less than three hundred gulden, but the trouble and the labour which Stein puts into the making of it cannot be paid for. His instruments have this special advantage over others that they are made with escape action. Only one maker in a hundred bothers about this. But without an escapement it is impossible to avoid jangling and vibration after the note is struck. When you touch the keys, the hammers fall back again the moment after they have struck the strings, whether you hold down the keys or release them ... He guarantees that the sounding-board will neither break nor split. When he has finished making one for a clavier, he places it in the open air, exposing it to rain, snow, the heat of the sun and all the devils in order that it may crack. Then he inserts wedges and glues them in to make the instrument very strong and firm. He is delighted when it cracks, for he can then be sure that nothing more can happen to it. Indeed he often cuts into it himself and then glues it together again and strengthens it in this way ... The device too which you work with your knee is better on his than on other instruments. I have only to touch it and it works; and when you shift your knee the slightest bit, you do not hear the least reverberation.'\nThis letter dates from slightly before the Stein action was fully perfected; presumably, the version that Stein had developed by 1777 was good enough to impress Mozart at the time.\n\nDuring the years following his move to Vienna (1781), Mozart made enough money to buy a fine piano, and he bought one not from Stein, but from Anton Walter, a Viennese builder who followed Stein's principles. It is not known whether Mozart actually preferred Walter's pianos to Stein's, or simply wanted to buy locally rather than having an instrument shipped all the way from Augsburg.\n\nStein was the founder of an important piano-making dynasty. His daughter Nannette (Augsburg, 1769 - Vienna 1833) was a skilled builder, and continued the family business under her husband's name, Streicher. The Streicher firm built pianos for Beethoven and played an important role in the technological development of the piano. Run by family members, it endured until 1894, still making (much larger) pianos with the basic action design from Stein.\n\nThe Stein pianos remain prestigious today and have served as models for contemporary builders (such Philip Belt and Paul McNulty) of historically-styled instruments.\n\n\n"}

It was used as the floating prison for the conspirators in the Abraham Lincoln assassination and was the site of the autopsy and identification of assassin John Wilkes Booth.\n\n\"Montauk\" was built by John Ericsson at Continental Iron Works, Greenpoint, Brooklyn; launched on October 9, 1862; and commissioned at New York on December 14, 1862, Commander John L. Worden in command.\n\nA principal ironclad in the naval attack on Charleston, South Carolina, \"Montauk\" departed New York on December 24, 1862, arriving Port Royal, South Carolina on January 19, 1863, to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Taking advantage of the opportunity to test the XV-inch Dahlgren gun and armor of the \"Passaic\"-class ironclad for the first time, on January 27, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont sent \"Montauk\", with the gunboats , , and mortar schooner to bombard Fort McAllister, Georgia. Although hit 13 times, \"Montauk\" was undamaged. The ironclad made a second attack on February 1, badly battering the fort; but \"Montauk\" was hit 48 times. She destroyed the blockade runner \"Rattlesnake\" on February 28 in Ogeechee River but while descending the river was herself damaged by a torpedo (mine) which exploded under her.\n\n\"Montauk\" steamed into the North Fork of the Edisto River on April 1 in preparation for the attack on Charleston. At midafternoon on April 7, Admiral Du Pont's ironclads attacked Fort Sumter. The Union ships braved intense fire from Confederates coastal artillery, and kept their own guns operating effectively until withdrawing toward evening. Damage to the monitors prevented Du Pont from resuming the attack the next day with \"Montauk\" taking 20 hits.\n\nThe ironclads launched an attack on Fort Wagner, Morris Island on July 10. Capturing this island was important as it would permit access to the interior defenses of Charleston Harbor. Assuming command of the naval forces, John Dahlgren boarded \"Montauk\" on July 16 and after consultation with the captains, renewed the attack on Fort Wagner and bombarded it daily until it was evacuated by the Confederates on September 6. The ships then turned their attention to Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie operating for the rest of the year against these fortifications which guarded the Cradle of the Rebellion. However, the Confederate works would never be taken by sea.\n\n\"Montauk\" remained off Charleston until July 1864, when she shifted operations to the Stono River. In February 1865, she transferred to the Cape Fear River. Proceeding to the Washington Navy Yard after the end of the conflict, she served as a floating bier for assassin John Wilkes Booth on April 27 and a floating prison for six accomplices.\n\nShe was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865. She remained there until sold to Frank Samuel on April 14, 1904, except for a stint from May 1898 to March 1899, when she served with a crew primarily consisting of local naval reservists to protect the harbor of Portland, Maine during the Spanish–American War.\n\n\n\n"}

The fish hatchery is located in Shasta County, California near the town of Anderson on the north bank of Battle Creek approximately east of the Sacramento River. Coleman NFH covers approximately of land owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), with an additional of land in perpetual easements for pipelines and access. It is the largest salmon hatchery in the continental United States.\n\nBefore the construction of the Shasta and Keswick Dams, Chinook Salmon and steelhead were free to migrate to the upper reaches of the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud Rivers to spawn. Chinook salmon and steelhead returning from the ocean, travel up the Sacramento River and Battle Creek where they are enticed by water flow into the hatchery. Eggs are collected, fertilized and incubated artificially until they hatch. The young fish are then raised in ponds at the hatchery until they are sufficient size to be released and return to the ocean. Long term production goals for Coleman NFH Complex are as follows: 12,000,000 fall Chinook salmon, 1,200,000 late-fall Chinook salmon, 250,000 winter Chinook salmon, and 600,000 steelhead annually. Winter Chinook salmon are reared at the Livingston Stone National Fish Hatchery, a sub-station of Coleman NFH, located at the base of Shasta Dam.\n\nColeman NFH was constructed in 1942 as a mitigation measure to preserve Chinook salmon populations following construction of Shasta Dam. Shasta Dam permanently blocked approximately 50% of key spawning and rearing habitat(s) for Chinook salmon and steelhead (Skinner 1958). The Shasta Salvage Plan authorized the construction and operation of a fish hatchery (Moffett 1949; Black 1999) to offset natural production losses. Fish production began at Coleman NFH in 1943. Production objectives for Coleman NFH include two runs of salmon and steelhead. The facility goal(s) are to ensure contribution from upper Sacramento River salmonid populations to commercial (ocean) and sport fisheries (ocean and river). Coleman NFH contributes substantially to the multimillion-dollar commercial and recreational fishing industry in California.\n\nThree intake structures and associated conveyance facilities are used to divert and convey water directly from Battle Creek and the Coleman Powerhouse tailrace (Figure 1). The primary intake (1) is located within the tailrace of Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) Coleman Powerhouse, on the north bank (Figure 2). Intake water is transferred through a conveyance pipe and diverted into Coleman Canal. The secondary intake (2) is located on the south bank of Battle Creek (across from intake 1). Intake 2 shares the conveyance pipe with intake 1 and diverts water to Coleman Canal. Intake 2 serves as an emergency back-up water diversion structure for intake 1, supplying water to Coleman Canal 17 days annually (10-year average 1990-2000). Intake 1 and 2 are approximately upstream of Coleman NFH. Intake 3 is upstream from Coleman NFH and acts as the tertiary diversion for the hatchery. Water is diverted from Intake 3 to the hatchery through pipe. Water from all intakes may be diverted to the ozone facility or sent directly to hatchery rearing units at Coleman NFH\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2082902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082902", "title": "Celtic art", "text": "Celtic art\n\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.\n\nCeltic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \"Celtic\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \"Celtic art\" only from the La Tène period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. The Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the Book of Kells and other masterpieces, and is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called Insular art in art history. This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.\n\nBoth styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare. Possibly the few standing male figures found, like the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the so-called \"Lord of Glauberg\", were originally common in wood.\n\nAlso covered by the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by Modern Celts, mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and nationalism, and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations, and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from Celtic cross funerary monuments to interlace tattoos. Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age. Another influence was that of late La Tène \"vegetal\" art on the Art Nouveau movement.\n\nTypically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the classical tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: \"Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces\".\n\nThe ancient peoples now called \"Celts\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples. The extent to which \"Celtic\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial.\n\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.\n\nThe term \"Celt\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Κελτοι, \"Celtae\"). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic—and Goidelic—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.\nThen in the 18th century the interest in \"primitivism\", which led to the idea of the \"noble savage\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \"Irish revival\" came after the \"Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829\" as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \"Celtic Revival\".\n\nThe earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture (from \"Hallstatt C\" onwards), comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC. Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on \"Celticization\" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions. Megalithic art across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many rock drawings left by the Neolithic Boyne Valley culture in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later. Other centres such as Brittany are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today. Other correspondences are between the gold lunulas and large collars of Bronze Age Ireland and Europe and the torcs of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck. The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.\n\nUnlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern \"Celtic nations\", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for \"town\", oppidum, is now used. The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves. The work of the German émigré to Oxford, Paul Jacobsthal, remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his \"Early Celtic Art\" of 1944.\n\nThe Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles. Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as \"Celtic\".\n\nAs Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek krater from the Vix Grave in Burgundy, which was made in Magna Graecia (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited. It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres. Another huge Greek vessel in the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others. Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.\nFigures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are \"cult wagons\" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect. There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a \"leaf crown\" — two flattish rounded projections, \"resembling a pair of bloated commas\", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.\n\nHuman heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based. Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions. In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large. There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.\n\nThe most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including reliefs, come from southern France, at Roquepertuse and Entremont, close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed. These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.\n\nIn general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people. There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the Waterloo Helmet, often have no similar other finds for comparison. Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.\n\nAbout 500 BC the La Tène style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction. The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy and modern Hungary. In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all. Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including Scythian art and that of the Greeks and Etruscans among others. The occupation by the Persian Achaemenid Empire of Thrace and Macedonia around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance. La Tène style is \"a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes\".\n\nThe most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display. Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery. Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich \"princely\" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from inhumation burials to cremation.\n\nThe torc was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner. Bracelets and armlets were also common. An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant. The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, Chamalières, France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at Clermont-Ferrand.\nSeveral phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain. In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the \"early\" or \"strict\" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the \"vegetal\", \"Continuous Vegetal\", \"Waldalgesheim style\", or De Navarro II, where ornament is \"typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface\".\n\nAfter about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into \"plastic\" and \"sword\" styles, the latter mainly found on scabbards and the former featuring decoration in high relief. One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a \"Disney style\" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an \"Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC\". De Navarro distinguishes the \"insular\" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V, and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.\nThe often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. So a torc in the rich Vix Grave terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the Snettisham Hoard that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up. The 1st century BC Gundestrup cauldron, is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69 cm, height 42 cm), but though much of its iconography seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of Thracian manufacture. To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark. The Agris Helmet in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.\n\nBy the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.\n\nA form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.\nDespite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality. Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard chapes, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern Northern Ireland, notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion. It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.\n\nBut in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations. Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south. However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a period of instability in Ireland.\n\nAfter the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles. Roman Britain produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the fibula but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult, for example a \"hinged brass collar\" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context. Britain also made more use of enamel than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element. Enamel decoration on penannular brooches, \"dragonesque\" brooches, and hanging bowls appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.\n\nCeltic art in the Middle Ages was practiced by the peoples of Ireland and parts of Britain in the 700-year period from the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of Romanesque art in the 12th century. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.\n\nIn Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period. The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late Iron Age La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there. With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called the Insular or Hiberno-Saxon style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before Viking raids severely disrupted monastic life. Late in the period Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings and mixed Norse-Gael populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the Norman invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.\n\nThe interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were in fact introduced to Insular art from the Mediterranean, both directly and via the animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art, though they were taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the types and forms of object used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life, especially in England.\nIn the 7th and 9th centuries Irish Celtic missionaries travelled to Northumbria in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of manuscript illumination, which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon metalworking knowledge and motifs. In the monasteries of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the Anglo-Saxon art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice. New techniques employed were filigree and chip carving, while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The Book of Durrow is the earliest complete insular script illuminated Gospel Book and by about 700, with the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed carpet pages that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the Book of Kells, the most elaborate Insular manuscript. Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic art for the rest of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the 9th and 11th century plain silver became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver penannular brooches were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. Sculpture began to flourish in the form of the \"high cross\", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice and the Ahenny High Cross.\nThe impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the Scandinavian Ringerike and Urnes styles, for example the Cross of Cong and Shrine of Manchan. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of Dublin, but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at Kilfenora and crosses at the Rock of Cashel.\n\nSome Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century Lichfield Gospels and Hereford Gospels. The late Insular Ricemarch Psalter from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence.\nArt from historic Dumnonia, modern Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Brittany on the Atlantic seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period. However archaeological studies at sites such as Cadbury Castle, Somerset, Tintagel, and more recently at Ipplepen indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the Byzantine Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the 'Old North'. Many crosses, memorials and tombstones such as King Doniert's Stone, the Drustanus stone and the notorious Artognou stone show evidence for a surprisingly cosmopolitan sub-Roman population speaking and writing in both Brittonic and Latin and with at least some knowledge of Ogham indicated by several extant stones in the region. Breton and especially Cornish manuscripts are exceedingly rare survivals but include the Bodmin manumissions demonstrating a regional form of the Insular style. \nFrom the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.\n\nThe heavy silver Whitecleuch Chain has Pictish symbols on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the Norrie's Law hoard. These are thought to be relatively early pieces. The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of Pictland and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD. \n\nPictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire).\nClass II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross).\n\nClass III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife).\n\nThe following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney.\n\nThe revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in Celtic literature. By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries. Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades. The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as Louis Sullivan, and in stained glass and wall stenciling by Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy, both based in Chicago with its large Irish-American population. The \"plastic style\" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty & Co.\n\nThe Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, Thomas Bodkin, writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, \"National art all over the world has burst long ago, the \nnarrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation.\" George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. \"Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.\n\nInterlace, which is still seen as a \"Celtic\" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-Dark Ages setting. \"The Secret of Kells\" is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.\n\nBy the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance. By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries. \n\nJune 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2082916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082916", "title": "Hantsport", "text": "Hantsport\n\nHantsport is a Canadian community located in Hants County, Nova Scotia. It is administratively part of the Municipality of the District of West Hants.\n\nThe community is located at the western boundary between Hants County and Kings County, along the west bank of the Avon River's tidal estuary. The community is best known for its former industries, including shipbuilding, a pulp mill, as well a marine terminal that once loaded gypsum, mined near Windsor. The community is the resting place of Victoria Cross recipient William Hall.\n\nHantsport (GAA) is rooted in deep sports tradition such as the Hantsport Shamrock but there is no tradition deeper than \"The Townies\" vs \"The Outta Townies\" football games once held on Cedar ave. The Townies put together many great seasons but the power house Outta Townies, who always seemed to be running downhill, walked away with the championship and most of all, bragging rights.\n\nThe area around Hantsport was known to the Miꞌkmaq as Kakagwek meaning \"place where meat is sliced and dried\" and the town is still home to a small Miꞌkmaq community known as the Glooscap First Nation or Pesikitk.\nAlthough no Acadians are known to have lived on the lands within the boundary of Hantsport proper, the area was part of the Acadian parish of Paroisse de Sainte Famille (established in 1698). Etienne Rivet and his progeny farmed the nearby marshlands of the Halfway River (currently the boundary between the town and the community of Mount Denson, Nova Scotia) and his son, Etienne, operated a mill on the river near where the marshlands meet the uplands on the town's southern boundary.\n\nAfter the Expulsion of the Acadians, the Acadian region of Piziquid was formed into the Township of Falmouth. These lands were granted to New England Planters, and officers of the British army. Colonel Henry Denny Denson, a retired British officer, was granted an extensive tract of land (Mount Denson), which included the lands lying north of the Halfway River and south of the Horton Township boundary. In 1789, after Denson's death, his consort and heir, Martha Whitfield, sold Lots Three & Four (the area of Hantsport) to an Edward Barker.\n\nEdward Barker (born at Lowdham, Nottinghamshire, England, 1745) was a British soldier, having arrived in Halifax in 1769 as a member of the 59th Regiment of Foot. In the early 1770s he mustered out of the army and by 1774 was at Falmouth, having married Rebecca Chadwick (see note) of Newport, Rhode Island. He appears to have either worked on Abel Mitchener lands or rented farm lands until 1788 when he purchased land in Falmouth. A year later Barker purchased the Hantsport lots and soon thereafter moved his family to Hantsport. Barker's arrival marks the beginning of the settlement which was initially known as \"Halfway River\" being the point halfway between Grand-Pré and Windsor.\n\nShipbuilding (see Ezra Churchill) emerged as a major industry in the 19th century and the town produced a large number of wooden sailing vessels and some steam vessels before the decline of wooden shipbuilding in the late 1800s. Notable vessels included the barque \"Hamburg\", the largest three masted barque ever built in Canada, and the barque \"Plymouth\", famous for the diaries of Alice Coalfleet, who raised a family aboard her. Hantsport shipbuilders active to the very end of the age of sail in the late 19th century and also built tugs and one steamship before wooden shipbuilding collapsed in the early 1900s. William Hall, an African-Canadian mariner born near Hantsport, was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1857 and is buried at a monument beside the Hantsport Baptist Church.\n\nThe arrival of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1869 stimulated a number of local manufacturers which provided some relief from the demise of shipbuilding. A cluster of small factories and fruit warehouses grew around the Hantsport station. Gypsum exports emerged as a major employer in the 20th Century, followed by the pulp mill and paper factory of the Minas Basin Pulp and Power Company established by the Jodrey family in the 1920s.\n\nArtifacts from the town's history are preserved at Churchill House, Hantsport, the restored mansion of the Churchill shipbuilding family (see Ezra Churchill) which serves as a community centre and museum.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the port was used for shipping gypsum which was quarried at two locations east of Windsor and shipped to Hantsport using the Dominion Atlantic Railway, and later the Windsor and Hantsport Railway which ran frequent gypsum trains controlled by the Hantsport station. The marine terminal used a loader to move gypsum from the storage building to waiting ships and was one of the fastest ship-loaders in the world, necessitated by the fact that the extreme tides in the Minas Basin require ships to enter and leave the port within a four- to five-hour period. Operations at Fundy Gypsum Company's ship loading facility were idled in early 2011, with the facility permanently closed later in 2011.\n\nOn November 1, 2012, the Minas Basin Pulp & Power pulp mill, which had been in operation in Hantsport for more than 85 years, announced it would cease all operations. This mill closed in December 2012, resulting in the loss of 135 jobs. The largest remaining employer in Hantsport is CKF Inc., a paper products maker originally founded by the Joudreys to provide a lcola market for the Minas Basin pulp mill, produces Royal Chinet paper plates, as well as egg cartons, cup carriers and other molded pulp products at its plant on the community's waterfront.\n\nIn the wake of the closures of the marine terminal and the pulp mill, Hantsport town council voted on April 16, 2014 to dissolve its municipal incorporation. The town was formally dissolved into the Municipality of the District of West Hants effective July 1, 2015.\n\nSports have been a significant part of the atmosphere in Hantsport. The Hantsport Hawks junior high team won the regional banner in 2015 and they repeated in 2016. The Hantsport Shamrocks are one of the most well known baseball clubs in Nova Scotia. The Hantsport Bruins are a dynasty in the Hants County Hockey League, winning 7 Howard Dill Cups since 1998. Some say that sports in Hantsport are \"the glue\" that holds the town together. In the 2005-06 track and field season, Kira Pederson set the Hantsport Junior High 100 m dash record with a time of 13.34 s, which still holds to this day.\n\n\n"}

Bush in order to restart orders for nuclear power reactors in the U.S. by providing subsidies for a handful of Generation III+ demonstration plants. The expectation was that these plants would come online by 2010, but it was not met.\n\nIn March 2017, the leading nuclear-plant maker, Westinghouse Electric Company, filed for bankruptcy due to losing over $9 billion in construction losses from working on two nuclear plants. This loss was partly caused by safety concerns due to the Fukushima disaster, Germany's Energiewende, the growth of solar and wind power, and low natural gas prices.\n\nThe \"Nuclear Power 2010 Program\" was unveiled by the U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham on February 14, 2002 as one means towards addressing the expected need for new power plants. The program is a joint government/industry cost-shared effort to identify sites for new nuclear power plants, to develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies, evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants, and demonstrate untested regulatory processes leading to an industry decision in the next few years to seek Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval to build and operate at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the United States.\n\nThree consortia responded in 2004 to the U.S. Department of Energy's solicitation under the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative and were awarded matching funds.\n\n\nOn September 22, 2005, NuStart selected Port Gibson (the Grand Gulf site) and Scottsboro (the Bellefonte site) for new nuclear units.

Entergy announced it will prepare its own proposal for the River Bend Station in St. Francisville.

Bush on August 8, 2005, has a number of articles related to nuclear power, and three specifically to the 2010 Program.\n\nFirst, the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act was extended to cover private and DOE plants and activities licensed through 2025.\n\nAlso, the government would cover cost overruns due to regulatory delays, up to $500 million each for the first two new nuclear reactors, and half of the overruns due to such delays (up to $250 million each) for the next four reactors. Delays in construction due to vastly increased regulation were a primary cause of the high cost of some earlier plants.\n\nFinally, \"A production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 6,000 megawatt-hours from new nuclear power plants for the first eight years of their operation, subject to a $125 million annual limit. The production tax credit places nuclear energy on an equal footing with other sources of emission-free power, including wind and closed-loop biomass.\"\n\nThe Act also funds a Next Generation Nuclear Plant project at INEEL to produce both electricity and hydrogen. This plant will be a DOE project and does not fall under the 2010 Program.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new nuclear power reactors in the United States. \nHowever, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak U.S. economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan after a tsunami. Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.\n\nOnly a few new reactors will enter service by 2020. These will not be cheaper than coal or natural gas, but they are an attractive investment for utilities because the government mandates that taxpayers pay for construction in advance. In 2013, four aging reactors were permanently closed due to the stringent requirements of the NRC and actions by local politicians.\n\n"}

He was also a movie producer, and Choctaw Indian historian. Ferguson is best known for writing the bestselling songs \"On the Wings of a Dove\" and \"The Carroll County Accident\". The \"Carroll County Accident\" won the Country Music Association Song of the Year in 1969. In 1983 \"Wings of a Dove\" was featured in the movie \"Tender Mercies\" starring Robert Duvall. In 1987, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) awarded Ferguson with the \"million air\" plays for the \"Wings of a Dove.\"\n\nThe country song \"Carroll County Accident\", recorded by Porter Wagoner, made No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the \"Cash Box\" country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton. Ferguson married twice, first to Harvie June Van (1950s/60s) then to Martha Jean Lewis (1970 to 2001).\n\nFerguson was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, the third son of John Carl and Mary Willie Boles Ferguson. His brothers were John Carl, Alan Claude, and Paul Eugene. John Carl attended the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1944. Alan Claude became a renowned forest ranger. Paul Eugene, as an enlisted sailor, witnessed many Pacific Proving Grounds atomic tests while aboard the USS Estes. The Fergusons have a rich legacy including ancestors whom participated in the American Revolution.\n\nWhile in high school, Ferguson was a typesetter at the local newspaper, a fire tower lookout for the U.S. Forest Service, and a member of the Missouri State Guard during World War II. After graduating from high school in 1945, he entered the U.S. Army. He attained the rank of sergeant and served as a radioman for two winters in Alaska. He tested military equipment under Arctic conditions. He went on to study at Southwest Missouri State University.\n\nAfter discharge from the Army, Ferguson went out West and worked for the U.S. Forest Service as a fire tower lookout and trail crew boss. He also worked as a laborer in the wheat fields and a typesetter for the newspaper in Moses Lake, Washington. He led the Boy Scout Troop from that city to the Boy Scout Jamboree at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1950.\n\nFerguson then entered Washington State College, Pullman, Washington, under the GI Bill and earned a BS in Speech. He specialized in radio and television production.\n\nWhile in college, Ferguson joined a U.S. Marine Reserve unit. He was called to duty during the Korean War (1950–1952). Ferguson served as a Drill Instructor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and producer of Marine training motion pictures.\n\nFrom about 1955-1961, Ferguson worked at the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, headquartered in Nashville, where he produced films for the agency. In 1959, Ferguson was to produce for the commission a 39 segment series on hunting, fishing, and wildlife subjects. In 1960, the North American Wildlife Conservation Association named his production \"The World Outdoors\" the \"Best Motion Picture of the Year.\" \"The World Outdoors\" influenced many wildlife television shows, most notably \"Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom\" series.\n\nWhile working there, Ferguson also started in the music business. In 1958 he wrote his first multi-million seller song \"On the Wings of a Dove\". It was recorded by Ferlin Husky whom Ferguson met in El Cajon, California. It has since been recorded by many artists and in many languages around the world. It was featured in the movie \"Tender Mercies\" (1983), starring Robert Duvall. In 1987, \"Wings of a Dove\" received BMI's \"One million airplays\" Award.\n\nPerforming with Husky, Ferguson played a character called Eli Possumtrout in \"The Good Old Days\", a motion picture produced by the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission.\n\nAfter graduation from college, Ferguson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, as manager for Ferlin Husky.\n\nThe success of his song \"On the Wings of a Dove\" enabled Ferguson to turn full-time to music. He became a senior producer with RCA Victor, where he helped create the Nashville Sound of the 1950s and 1960s. He served as executive assistant to Chet Atkins until his retirement. While there, he produced records, many in RCA Studio A. He particularly worked with producing the acts of Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton, (from 1967 - 75 he produced nearly all of Wagoner and Parton's duet albums, as well as all of their respective solo releases during that time) and Connie Smith. He also produced records by Floyd Cramer, Danny Davis, The Browns, Helen Cornelius, Lester Flatt, Homer and Jethro, Charlie Pride and many others. With Atkins, he played a major role in the development of what was to become known as the Nashville Sound and elevated Nashville as the country music capital of the world. He also played a major role in developing the Country Music Association. His first successful single was with The Avons.\n\nFerguson developed a comedy role as \"Grandpappy Eli Possumtrot\", a name which he took from a crossroad community near his childhood home in the Ozarks. In that role, he recorded his own song, \"Eli's Blue\", a lament about a man who accidentally shot his dog.\n\nFerguson wrote several other songs, including the million seller, \"Carroll County Accident\", first recorded by Porter Wagoner. In 1969 it received a Country Music Award for the \"Song of the Year\". In the 1960s Ferguson also wrote \"Natividad\", a Christmas song, and \"Choctaw Saturday Night\", a tribute to Choctaw Native Americans.\n\nThe country song \"Carroll County Accident\" was written when Ferguson passed through Carroll County when driving from Nashville to a concert for the Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia, Miss., according to an interview Ferguson granted with Steve Eng for the Wagoner biography \"A Satisfied Mind\". He recounted that he passed a sign for Carroll County in Tennessee, which inspired the song's title, and when he saw a sign for Carroll County in Mississippi the song was a finished work. Wagoner took the song to No. 2 on the Billboard country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the \"Cash Box\" country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton.\n\nWith Jesse Burt as co-author, Ferguson wrote two books: \"So You Want to be in Music\" and \"Southeastern Indians: Then and Now\".\n\n\"So You Want to be in Music\" is a book about the music industry for aspiring songwriting and recording professionals. \"Southeastern Indians: Then and Now\" is a general-interest book about Native Americans of the Deep South, covering the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes.\n\nWhile working at RCA, Ferguson earned a Master's Degree in anthropology from Vanderbilt University. He served as volunteer Project Director and President of Southeastern Indian Antiquities Survey and in that role oversaw the survey, recovery, and preservation of remains and artifacts unearthed during construction in the Nashville area. One startling discovery was the remains of the first saber-toothed tiger found east of the Mississippi River. It was found during construction of the Regions Center, former First American Bank building, in downtown Nashville. On September 25, 1997, the newly established hockey team, the Nashville Predators, adopted the head of a saber-toothed tiger as their logo.\n\nAfter his retirement from RCA, Ferguson moved his family to live near the reservation of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He had worked in various capacities with the tribe since the 1950s. There he served as editor of the \"Choctaw Times\", and historian and audio- visual producer for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. In that role, he helped establish the Museum of the Southern Indian (Choctaw Museum) in 1981. He also worked part-time as promotional director of the Chucalissa Prehistoric Indian Village in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1983, he created the foundation for Choctaw Video Productions and created numerous tribal productions.\n\nIn 1987, Ferguson established WHTV as local cable service for Pearl River/Philadelphia, Mississippi. He retired from that position in 1998, when he was also named Tribal Historian \"Emeritus\". He established the tribe's organic gardening program in 1978.\n\nRobert Bruce \"Bob\" Ferguson, Sr. died of Cancer on Sunday, July 22, 2001 at 1:05 a.m. in the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. He was buried at Phillip's Cemetery in rural Neshoba County near Philadelphia, MS.\n\nFerguson was the recipient of many awards and recognitions during his multiple careers. He was also a member of Mensa, a society of people with high I.Q.s.\n\n\nFerguson worked for nearly 30 years at RCA's Studio B producing hundreds of albums for artists such as Chet Atkins, Dolly Parton, and Porter Wagoner.\n\n"}

It is similar to Chapter 13 in structure, but it offers additional benefits to farmers and fishermen in certain circumstances, beyond those available to ordinary wage earners. Chapter 12 is applicable only to family farmers and fishermen.\n\nFor much of the history of bankruptcy law in the United States, there was no provision applicable specifically to farmers. The 1898 Bankruptcy Act contained no special provisions, with one exception that farmers were immune from an involuntary bankruptcy petition. Section 75 was enacted by the Bankruptcy Act of 1933 and provided specific provisions for farmers. However, many of these provisions were limited in scope, and ultimately required the voluntary cooperation of mortgagors and creditors.\n\nIn addition, section 75, as it was originally conceived, was a temporary measure. It was scheduled to expire on March 3, 1938.\n\nThe Frazier-Lemke Act expanded the scope of section 75, providing for stronger protections available to farmers operating under bankruptcy protection. These changes too were initially temporary, but they were extended a number of times until they ultimately expired on March 31, 1949.\n\nBy and large, after the expiration of section 75, farmers were subject to the same rules of bankruptcy as other debtors. The application of the same rules was the case after the passage of the Bankruptcy Code of 1976 until 1986.\n\nChapter 12 was added to the Bankruptcy Code in 1986 by the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986. It went into effect on November 26, 1986.\n\nThe modification of the bankruptcy code were intended as an emergency response to tightening agricultural credit in the early and mid-1980s, in the middle of a number of notable bank failures.\n\nThe Act was to originally expire on October 1, 1993, but it was extended a number of times without expiring until it was made permanent by the 2005 BAPCPA.\n\nChapter 12 provides additional benefits not available under chapter 13 and chapter 11. These benefits include higher debt ceilings than those under chapter 13, and more advantageous exemptions.\n"}

She was the first woman elected to state-wide office when she was elected Missouri's first, and thus far only, woman Lieutenant Governor.\n\nBorn Ruth Harriett Friedman in Cleveland, Ohio, she received her Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from the University of Michigan where she was the first woman to serve as Senior Editor of the Michigan Daily during peacetime. \n\nShe married Jim Woods on January 2, 1953 and had three sons. Beginning in the early 1960s, Woods began working as a writer, moderator, producer, and talk show host on local television stations. Her programs covered serious topics such as child abuse, women's issues, civil rights, and the Vietnam War. Her political career began as a member of the University City Council in 1967, where she served for seven years, before being appointed to the Missouri Highway Commission in 1974 by then-Governor Kit Bond.\n\nWoods was first elected to the Missouri State Senate in 1976, becoming the second woman ever elected, and was re-elected in 1980. In 1982, she made a strong bid for the US Senate, running against moderate incumbent Republican John Danforth. Aided by a strong grassroots base that rallied under the slogan, \"Give them hell, Harriett!\" (a play on a similar slogan used by supporters of another Missourian, Harry S. Truman), Woods built a political presence in the state. Danforth defeated Woods by a mere 26,000 votes, a margin of less than two percent, the closest election of the 1982 election year. Some have argued that the deciding margin in the campaign was Woods' strong support for abortion rights in a state where many rural voters, and the large Catholic population in the St. Louis area, generally opposed abortion.\n\nIn that 1982 election, Harriett Woods carried the rural areas of the state including every county in the southeast part of the state. She also carried the \"Little Dixie\" area of the state, an area of mid-Missouri traditionally linked to southern, more conservative, political views, along with the heavily Democratic Kansas City area.\n\nHowever, she had problems in some traditionally Democratic areas as she lost St. Louis County to Danforth, despite the fact that she lived and worked as a television producer and newspaper reporter in University City, a suburb of St. Louis. Danforth was also from the St. Louis area. Using her skills as a journalist and former television producer and personality, Harriett Woods was able to communicate her message effectively over television. After trailing Danforth in some polls by more than fifty points after the primary, by mid-October, she was running dead even in the polls with the more widely known, and heavily financed incumbent—Danforth (grandson of William Danforth, the founder of Ralston-Purina and the Danforth Foundation). Her narrow loss, by a mere 26,000 votes, was the closest of the 1982 election year. \n\nAnother important reason for Hariett Woods' narrow loss was the fact that she was outspent ($1,849,025 for Danforth and $1,193,966 for Woods) with almost half of her total coming in the last few weeks of the campaign, too late to allow for the purchase of substantial media. As a result, Woods ran out of money during the latter stages of the campaign, forcing her to pull her very effective television ads for an entire week. Nationwide, publicity over the narrow loss of a candidate who, with a little more money might have been the first woman ever elected Senator from the State of Missouri, led to the creation of the political action committee called Emily's List in 1985 (\"Early Money is Like Yeast\") \n\nIn 1984, Woods ran for the office of Lieutenant Governor. She succeeded in her bid, even as voters elected Republican John Ashcroft as Governor and as Ronald Reagan carried Missouri on his way to a 49-state re-election victory. Woods thus became the first woman elected to statewide office in Missouri.\n\nIn 1986, she once again was chosen as the Democratic nominee for the Senate, this time running against former Governor Kit Bond for the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Thomas A. Eagleton. In another tight race, Woods lost by a three-point margin. She continued to serve as Lieutenant Governor until 1989.\n\nAfter her retirement she remained prominent, especially as an activist for women in politics. From 1991 to 1995, she was president of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1999, she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She also taught classes on gender and politics at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, Pace University, and Hunter College. Woods was inducted into the St. Louis Hall of Fame in 1999. In January 2001, she joined other Missouri Democrats to oppose the nomination of John Ashcroft for U.S. Attorney General.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2082945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082945", "title": "Fimbriation", "text": "Fimbriation\n\nIn heraldry and vexillology, fimbriation is the placement of small stripes of contrasting colour around common charges or ordinaries, usually in order for them to stand out from the background, or perhaps just because the designer felt it looked better, or for a more technical reason (in heraldry only) to avoid what would otherwise be a violation of the rule of tincture. While fimbriation almost invariably applies to both or all sides of a charge, there are very unusual examples of fimbriation on one side only. Another rather rare form is double fimbriation (blazoned \"double fimbriated\"), where the charge or ordinary is accompanied by two stripes of colour instead of only one. In cases of double fimbriation the outer colour is blazoned first. The arms of Mozirje, in Slovenia, show an example of fimbriation that itself is fimbriated.\n\nFimbriation may also be used when a charge is the same colour as the field on which it is placed. A red charge placed on a red background may be necessary, for instance where the charge and field are both a specific colour for symbolic or historical reasons, and in these cases fimbriation becomes a necessity in order for the charge to be visible. In some cases, such as a fimbriated cross placed on a field of the same colour as the cross, the effect is identical to the use of cross voided, i.e. a cross shown in outline only.\n\nAccording to the rule of tincture, one of the fundamental rules of heraldic design, colour may not be placed on colour nor metal on metal. (In heraldry, \"metal\" refers to gold and silver, frequently represented using yellow and white respectively. \"Colour\" refers to all other colours.) Sometimes, however, it is desired to do something like this, so fimbriation is used to comply with the rule.\nIn vexillology that is not specifically heraldic, the rules of heraldry do not apply, yet fimbriation is still frequently seen. The reason for this is largely the same as the reason for the heraldic rule of tincture: that is, the need for visibility — the separation of darker colours by white or yellow is an aid to the visual separation of the darker colours. A good example of a flag which uses fimbriation is the national flag of South Africa which is fimbriated in white above and below the central green area, and in yellow between it and the triangle at the hoist.\n\nThough fimbriation is, heraldically, intended to be used to separate areas that are both colours (by the use of a metal) or both metals (by the use of a colour), occasionally flags may be found which use fimbriation in non-standard ways. One example of this is the flag of the Faroe Islands, which separates a red cross from a white field with blue fimbriation. Another example of this non-standard fimbriation is the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, which separates areas of blue and red with black fimbriation. The flag of Uzbekistan also uses this form of \"pseudo-fimbriation\" - it adds a thin red band between a colour and a metal, separating blue (above) and green (below) from a central white stripe.\n\nSome 15 to 20 countries use fimbriation on their national flags. National flags that use fimbriation include those of Trinidad and Tobago, North Korea, Botswana, Kenya and - most famously - the British Union Flag. On this last flag the fimbriation is unusual, as a white fimbriation separates a blue field from a red cross (representing England) but also from a divided red and white saltire (the red representing Ireland and the white representing Scotland). The white fimbriation along the white part of the saltire - possibly unique in vexillology - is responsible for the famous \"lopsidedness\" of the Union Jack, giving it the appearance of having a red saltire fimbriated more widely on one side than the other.\n"}

Created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung, the character first appeared in \"Young Avengers\" #1 (April 2005). The character's appearance is patterned on that of two prominent Marvel superheroes, Thor and Scarlet Witch, both of whom are members of the Avengers. Like the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan possesses powerful magical abilities which make him a key member of his superhero team.\n\nRecruited to the Young Avengers by Iron Lad, Wiccan's story includes the discovery that he and fellow teen hero Speed are in fact long-lost twin brothers, and that the pair are the sons of Scarlet Witch and her husband Vision. Significant storylines for the character include him and his brother's search for their missing mother, learning to master his powers, and an ongoing relationship with his teammate Hulkling.\n\nAlongside his permanent role as a member of the Young Avengers, Wiccan has also been a member of Avengers Idea Mechanics and is currently starring as a member of Strikeforce.\n\nWiccan first appeared in \"Young Avengers\" #1 (April 2005). The issue was scripted by Allan Heinberg and drawn by Jim Cheung. One of the original four members of the Young Avengers, the team was founded after the Avengers disbanded in the story line \"Avengers Disassembled\".\n\nInitially, Heinberg assumed that Marvel would not allow him to write two leading homosexual characters. Because of this, he originally planned to write Billy's love interest, Hulkling, as a female shapeshifter named Chimera. Chimera would discover that her true form was male, which would force Billy to decide if he was still in love with him. However, due to the complexity of this proposed story line, editor Tom Brevoort suggested simply making both characters gay.\n\nWiccan appeared in the new 2013 \"Young Avengers\" series by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie.\n\nAs part of the All-New All-Different Marvel rebranding, Wiccan (along with Hulkling) appears as a member of the New Avengers led by Sunspot along with Songbird, Squirrel Girl, Hawkeye, Power Man and White Tiger. He later guest-starred in the Scarlet Witch series written by James Robinson.\n\nIn 2019, he will star in \"Strikeforce\" alongside Blade, Angela, Spider-Woman, Monica Rambeau, Daimon Hellstrom and Winter Soldier.\n\nBilly Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Jeff Kaplan, a cardiologist, and Rebecca Kaplan, a psychologist.\n\nRegularly bullied in school because of his homosexuality, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash healed Billy's wounds, and a few weeks later, he stood up for another kid being bullied, demonstrating his mutant powers for the first time, and nearly killing his tormentor.\n\nHe was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Iron Lad's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian, but later changed it to Wiccan.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from \"self-help books\" owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, \"I want Iron Lad to forget\") and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can manipulate reality, causing certain events and effects to happen.\n\nBilly has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision.\n\nIn the past, the Scarlet Witch used her reality warping powers to create twin sons, unknowingly, from two (of five) scattered fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto that were previously lost to him in an ill-fated encounter with the powerful mutant child, Franklin Richards. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepherd, the Young Avenger Speed, and Billy.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations.\n\nWhen the Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli Bradley (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico Minoru to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan, Karolina, and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him.\n\nWiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers (Captain America). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead, slain by Ragnarok, the cyborg clone of Thor. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side.\n\nBilly and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells.\n\nBilly is shown to be a member of the Initiative, along with Hulkling. However, it is later revealed that some, perhaps most, of the Young Avengers did not actually join The Initiative or even register. They were registered by their Earth-A counterparts; both Wiccan and Hulking are seen complaining about being registered to their \"A Selves\".\nIt's been subsequently shown that since registration, Billy has spent most of his time at home, apparently grounded, with his parents wanting him to register.\n\nWiccan and Speed later search for the Scarlet Witch following the events of Civil War. While Billy and Tommy both search for Wanda (referring to her as \"Mom\") they encounter Master Pandemonium, who recognizes Wiccan's magic as that of the Scarlet Witch and further explains their original history as the Scarlet Witch's children. However, he likens the boys' search for their past and Wanda to his own former life as rising actor, and tells them that their past was \"darkness and chaos\" and advises them that they should embrace who they are now. This appears to have satisfied Wiccan, who calls off his search for now, deciding that he is happy with the person he is and the people in his life.\n\nBilly, with the other Young Avengers, teams up with the Runaways again when the Skrulls invade.\n\nWiccan gathers the Young Avengers together at the Avengers Mansion to respond to wave of supernatural chaos caused by Chthon. The team is turned to stone by Chthon's magic, except for Vision and Stature, who arrive too late.\n\nDoctor Strange, the former Sorcerer Supreme and one of Marvel's premiere magic users, visits Wiccan to discuss his potential candidacy and ability to assume the position as the new Sorcerer Supreme. When the Hood finds Strange and engages him in magical combat, Wiccan aids him, contrary to Strange's orders to flee. Wiccan and Strange teleport to the New Avengers seeking help. Later, he is seen controlled by Nightmare in \"Doctor Voodoo\".\n\nDuring the Siege of Asgard, Wiccan and the other Young Avengers were among those who answered Steve Rogers' assembly call for the purpose of overthrowing Norman Osborn's regime and defending Asgard. Wiccan, a lover of Asgardian mythology, fought in the battle, and alongside Hulkling defeated the Wrecking Crew, who were looting the Throne Room after the fall of Asgard. He displayed a fearsome level of power producing lightning bolts to conquer the villains, much to Hulkling's worry.\n\nDuring a fight between a group of nuclear-armed Sons of the Serpent and the Young Avengers, Wiccan loses control of his powers and renders the entire group of terrorists comatose. The Avengers arrive and take Wiccan to their base stating that they want to examine his full capabilities, concerned that, like the Scarlet Witch, if he were to lose control of his powers, he could cause massive devastation. In the process, the Avengers reveal to the team that the Scarlet Witch, having gone insane after losing her twin sons, killed several of her teammates, changed all of reality into House of M, and then was responsible for the depowering and deaths of millions of mutants. Wiccan reiterates his belief that he and Speed are truly the transposed souls of the Scarlet Witch's children and that she may not have been purposefully behind those events. Seeing the Avengers' and his friends' distrust of the Scarlet Witch and their discomfort with him due to uncertainty of his powers, he storms out, only to find that Captain America has informed his parents of what occurred during the early battle. Wiccan, accompanied by Hulkling, goes with Captain America and is situated for observation. However, the other Young Avengers decide to break them out, urging Wiccan to search for the Scarlet Witch. By showing her that the children she lost may be alive and well, the Young Avengers believe that she may be cured of her madness and be able to reverse the damage she had done. In particular, Stature hopes that locating and curing the Scarlet Witch could mean a chance at reviving her father. Immediately, Magneto arrives, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather.\n\nHowever the Avengers intercede in the conversation and go into battle with Magneto and the Young Avengers. Wiccan is attacked by Wolverine and is then convinced by Ms. Marvel that this is a battle they cannot win. Wiccan then teleports his team and Magneto to Wundagore Mountain in Transia, The Scarlet Witch's birthplace, leaving the Avengers behind, who decide to let Wiccan find the Scarlet Witch so they can take care of both of them at once. Upon arriving, Patriot lashes out in anger at Wiccan, but Hawkeye intercedes and decides that they will look for the Scarlet Witch together. Patriot then confides with Hawkeye that he believes the Avengers are right and that they need to go back. However Hawkeye tells Patriot that he needs to pick a side and walks away angry. The Vision confides his fear that Stature may sacrifice herself to bring back her father, and that that is something that neither he nor her father would want. Finally, the group reaches the Grave of Magda, Wanda's mother, and Magneto tells the children about the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's birth. Wiccan then reaches out with his magic and finds the Scarlet Witch in the town, and Speed goes to investigate, only to run into Quicksilver. Quicksilver then threatens Magneto and kidnaps Wiccan. Speed however catches up with Quicksilver and the two race, with Wiccan being carried by Quicksilver the whole time. Eventually, Quicksilver decides that the only way to stop his father and get Wiccan to help him find his sister is to kill Magneto. He fashions out stakes using fence posts and runs back to the village, throwing wooden stakes at Magneto, who dodges them. In the process, Quicksilver seemingly impales Wanda, who is discovered to be a Doombot, and that Doctor Doom has the real Scarlet Witch.\n\nThat night, everyone, Magneto and Quicksilver included, debates over invading Latveria to retrieve the Scarlet Witch, and they decide to sleep on it until the morning. Wiccan secretly leaves the group and is in the middle of a spell to teleport himself to Latveria. Quicksilver interrupts him, pointing out their similarities and again trying to get Wiccan to help him. However, Hulking arrives with the rest of the Young Avengers, threatening Quicksilver and reprimanding Wiccan. Meanwhile, the Avengers meet with Wonder Man, hoping to use him to find Wanda and Wiccan. Simon, however, refuses and decides to go and find Wanda himself and help bring her back. Late that night in Transia, Wiccan writes a note for Hulkling expressing his love and apologizing for leaving for Latveria alone. Wiccan then teleports to Doom's castle and disguises himself as the Scarlet Witch to gain access. He is escorted by Doombots to a room where he is then assaulted by an amnesiac Scarlet Witch. Wiccan tells Wanda that he plans to rescue, omitting that he is her son. However, Wanda states that there is no need for that as she is about to be married. Doctor Doom then arrives to tell Wiccan that it is he whom Wanda will marry, and then attacks Wiccan.\n\nWiccan tries to tell Wanda about her past life as the Scarlet Witch, but Dr. Doom knocks him unconscious during the battle before Wiccan can finish. Later, Doom tells Wiccan that Wanda came to him, and although he does not understand how, he has truly fallen in love with Wanda. Later, Wanda comes to see Wiccan asking him to tell her everything about the Scarlet Witch before she marries Doom. In the meantime, Magneto and the Young Avengers plan to invade Doom's castle in order to get Wiccan back, but are stopped by Wonder Man, and the Avengers who followed him secretly. A battle ensues, and Wolverine goes to find Wanda and Wiccan to kill them, but is stopped by Iron Lad, who states that the future depends on Wiccan's survival.\n\nEventually Wanda recovers her memory and powers. Billy asks her to use her magic to determine whether or not they are truly mother and son. It becomes clear that they are, and Wanda begs Billy's forgiveness. Mother and child embrace lovingly and weep for joy. Wanda is now determined to undo the harm she did, and restore the mutants. The first beneficiary is Rictor.\n\nHowever, the X-Men intervene, and as the Avengers arrive, the two teams fight. Wanda teleports herself and the Young Avengers back to Latveria. Wiccan decides to help Dr. Doom and Wanda cast a spell to give the mutants back their powers. However, Patriot refuses to trust Dr. Doom, and shoots an explosive arrow at him to stop the spell, which results in Dr. Doom attaining Wanda's reality altering powers. The new Dr. Doom teleports the team after Wanda begs him to relinquish the power. Dr. Doom appears in front of the X-Men, the Avengers, X-Factor, the Young Avengers, and Wanda, and a battle ensues ending in Cassie's death. Wanda and Wiccan manage to drain the power from Dr. Doom, and he leaves. Iron Lad wants to take back Cassie's body into the timestream to find someone who could bring her back, but the Vision stops him and is subsequently destroyed. Wanda leaves to find herself, the X-Men go back to Utopia, and the Young Avengers decide to disband.\n\nWiccan blames himself for everything that has happened, and ends up falling into a depression, but with Hulkling proposing to him the two get back into costume with Hawkeye and Speed (Patriot moved to Arizona) and Captain America makes the team full-fledged Avengers.\n\nIn a one-shot issue of \"Children's Crusade: Young Avengers\", a flash to the future shows Billy wearing the uniform of Dr. Strange, implying he has attained the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme at some point in the future.\n\nSome time later, it is revealed that the group went their separate ways due to their several losses. Billy and Teddy are living together with Billy's parents. Billy discovers though that Teddy has broken their promise to give up being superheroes by fighting crime at night. After getting into an argument, Billy tries to make it up to Teddy by shuffling through different realities to find one identical to theirs at the moment before Teddy's mother died. Billy finds this moment and brings Teddy's mother back to life. However, the Mother soon displays strange abilities and attempts to kill Billy and Teddy, with somehow Billy's parents not noticing. After escaping her, they run into Loki, who due to recent events, is a child again. He tells them that the Mother is not actually Teddy's mom, but a parasite from the multiverse who takes the guise of whatever travelers are looking for. Due to its strange abilities, adults are oblivious to whatever happens around the Mother, and any parents around them become part of her personal army (save for Scarlet Witch, who is able to resist, but still remains oblivious to what is going on, as with the rest of the Avengers). The three soon reunite with Kate, who has been having one night stands with Noh-Varr, while joined by America Chavez, a god from another universe with super-strength and the ability to kick holes in reality. Discovering that any parents around the group fall prey to Mother's spell, the group uses Noh-Varr's ship to leave Earth, while Loki will train Billy in magic to hopefully reverse what he has done.\n\nOn their travels, Loki talks to Teddy about Billy's powers, saying that it's highly unlikely that some attractive alien prince would just happen to find Billy, happen to be gay, and happen to fall in love with him. Teddy begins to wonder if he was indeed created by Billy to fill a hole in his life. Soon they are summoned back to Earth by former X-Men member David Alleyne, who has been working a temp job with Tommy. According to him, a mysterious figure wearing Patriot's old outfit kidnapped Tommy, and he requires their help to find him. Apparently, Tommy was brought to another reality, and America uses her powers to let them travel between worlds. The group hop from universe to universe for a while, eventually finding a universe of adorable creatures worshipping Billy as a god named 'the demiurge'. Loki and America have been trying to hide this from Billy for a while, but they reveal that one day he shall become an entity known as the demiurge, and during his time as this being, will change the laws of magic in every universe and every time period, past, present, and future.\n\nHowever, the group is soon ambushed by Mother while in between universes, and they become separated. When reuniting, Teddy tells Billy and what he and Loki discussed, and the two break up while on Earth. Teddy takes a break from the group, soon finding a support group for those wronged by the Young Avengers, apparently led by Mother. Mother kidnaps Teddy, and the Young Avengers prepare to save him.\n\nLoki develops a plan to have Billy access a fraction of the demiurge's power, which should be enough to kill Mother. Thinking they will be outnumbered by the armies Mother has been amassing made up of other-universe versions of the group and the parents she has brainwashed, David calls every super-powered hero under the age of 23 to help them fight, while all the world's older heroes and villains remain unaware that any of this is happening. Loki, however, tells Billy that Loki can only help if he is at full power, and Billy uses a spell to restore Loki to a young adult. Loki and Billy prepare to give Billy near-unlimited power while the battle in central park begins between Mother's army and the world's teenage and young adult heroes. Kate, America, Noh-Varr, and David save Teddy, Teddy finding Billy on the battlefield, who is unable to access his power. Teddy tells him it is okay, and the two kiss, this being the spark Billy needed to access the demiurge. Billy uses his moment of power to successfully kill Mother, getting rid of her spell and any trace of her through the multiverse. Billy reunites with his parents, introducing them to the group, though Loki has vanished.\n\nLater, a party is being held at a club by a mysterious benefactor, which the group and all the heroes who fought in the battle attend. Here, Billy and Teddy are shown to be once again in a happy relationship. The Young Avengers soon get ready to leave, save for Loki, who was watching from a distance, and was the benefactor for the party. The group leaves, as Loki reminisces while looking at a selfie they all took during their journeys together.\n\nLoki and America's prophecy comes true soon after Billy and Teddy are recruited by Sunspot to become members of the New Avengers, a team working alongside A.I.M.. A group of Kree-Skull hybrids arrive on Earth, intending for Teddy to finally ascend to his position as the Emperor who will unite the two warring races. Unable to stop their teleportation ray, Billy goes with him to their planet whilst the rest of the team attempt a rescue. Upon reaching the planet, they discover that one of the hybrids has been taken over by a ghost wizard named Moridun. He is killed by Teddy who resolves to return and take his place as Emperor when he is ready. Unbeknownst to the New Avengers, Moridun was not destroyed and has actually taken over Billy, who changes his codename to Demiurge. Under the control of Moridun, Billy begins acting weird, suggesting that they should kill some of the thieves they are fighting. It is only when a group of future avengers travel back in time to warn them does Teddy realise what has happened. Despite the future avengers preparing to kill Billy, Teddy encourages him to fight and he successfully drives Moridun out of his body, averting the huge amount of death that was to be caused. Later, Sunspot goes rogue, separating A.I.M. from the New Avengers and abandoning the team.\n\nDuring the second superhero civil war, Wiccan joins forces with several other sorcerers lead by Doctor Strange to destroy a Celestial. Although initially doubtful of his right to fight alongside such powerful magic users, his confidence is restored by Scarlet Witch. He is contacted by Sunspot, who convinces Billy, Teddy and Squirrel Girl to reform the New Avengers and work alongside A.I.M for one final mission. Wiccan teleports the trio onto a SHIELD helicarrier to aid in the rescue of Songbird before regrouping with Sunspot and facing off against the Maker and his Revengers. After this, the New Avengers permanently disband and, as a thank you, Sunspot gifts Wiccan and Hulkling an apartment overlooking Central Park, allowing the couple to focus on their personal lives for the time being. \n\nWhen Dark Elves invade Manhattan, Billy is summoned by Loki, who is initially disguised as Kate Bishop, to a drag bar where he attempts to convince him to side with Malekith in the war. Loki tries to gain Billy's forgiveness for attempting to manipulate him and steal the power of the demiurge when they both served as Young Avengers but he refuses, telling him it is not his place as he was not the only one wronged. While fighting Malekith's forces, Billy and Teddy see Loki's murder at the hands of Laufey and silently embrace.\n\nBilly suddenly finds himself in a medical facility handling biological weaponry alongside Angela, Spider-Woman, Spectrum and Winter Soldier with no memory of how he came to be there. He is taken into custody with the others and is greeted by Blade, who explains that the group were taken over by mysterious shapeshifters and framed for their actions. Angela quickly identifies these shapeshifters as Asgardian and the team track them to their base. Wiccan is reluctant to join the mission, believing that they are doing the wrong thing by keeping the Avengers in the dark about their mission but he is convinced that it is best if only a small group of people know about the shapeshifters as their power comes from people having knowledge of them. The group is attacked by Daimon Hellstrom and, assuming he is a shapeshifter in disguise, Blade kills him before receiving a phone call from Satana who explains that her brother is with her in Las Vegas and is acting strangely. The team go to Satana's club and Wiccan is tasked with destroying the shapeshifter but stresses that his powers don't allow him to resurrect Hellstrom. Destroying the shapeshifter causes it to burst into a swarm of smaller creatures who capture Wiccan, take his form and send the fake Wiccan to meet with Hulking. The shapeshifters keep the real Wiccan in a cell where they reveal that they have also captured Doctor Doom and command Wiccan to use his powers to gain Doom's secrets. Due to his history with Doom, Wiccan is apprehensive but quickly learns that they have captured a Doombot and have no idea that it is not the real Doctor Doom. Wiccan animates the Doombot and uses it to escape. The team retreat to a safehouse where Wiccan confronts the newly-resurrected Daimon Hellstrom about why he was working with the shapeshifters.\n\nAs Wiccan, Billy Kaplan possesses an innate mystical ability which allows him to alter and manipulate reality at will. While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning-based spells. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down force-fields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, astral projection, and telekinetic force beams.\n\nBilly must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others, and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.\n\nWiccan was one of the many possible candidates for the title of Sorcerer Supreme, and has been described by the Vision as \"one of the most powerful mages on the planet.\" Doctor Strange has partnered with a time traveling Wiccan from the future and was confirmed that he succeeds Strange being the Sorcerer Supreme. Loki Predicted that Wiccan will evolve into a god by his own right one day.\n\nIn Young Avengers vol. 2, it is revealed by Loki that Wiccan is destined to ascend to a god-like reality warper who will rewrite the rules of magic known as the Demiurge. He briefly achieves this form, and is able to view the past, present and future, as well as freely alter the universe. However, deciding that he is not ready to wield this power, he relinquishes it and reverts to his human form.\n\nIn \"Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme,\" Stephen Strange travels to a dimension in which past and future Sorcerer Supremes are all gathered. Billy is revealed to become the Sorcerer Supreme in the future after Stephen.\n\nHeinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans, \"According to Billy's theory, the souls of Wanda's twins inhabited his and Tommy's bodies when they were dispersed from Mephisto. But it's only a theory.\" He also stated in another interview that his plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda, stating \"If everything goes according to plan, Wanda will indeed return to \"Young Avengers\" early in Season Two, when Billy and Tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers.\" Indeed, the \"Young Avengers Present\" issue from March 2008 involves the \"twin brothers\" Wiccan and Speed looking for their \"mother Wanda\".\n\nThe Super-Skrull and the Vision's files consider Kaplan and Shepherd to be siblings. While Kaplan believes himself and Shepherd may be Wanda Maximoff's reincarnated children, Shepherd is more skeptical about the situation.\n\nDuring their search for the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan is even more certain that he and Tommy are siblings. Both boys refer to one another as \"brothers\" and Speed claims to be the older of the two (though neither knows for certain) and also refer to the Scarlet Witch as \"Mom\" while searching for her.\n\nIn \"Children's Crusade\" #6, Scarlet Witch confirms that Billy and Tommy are the genetic reincarnations of her sons.\n\nWhen Wanda is discussing her life with a psychiatrist, she again confirms that Billy and Tommy are the reincarnated souls of her sons. However, seeing as they are already teenagers, Wanda doesn't know if they were normal kids before her sons' souls took over their bodies (effectively killing whoever they were before) or whether the spirits went back in time to be born and raised by different parents.\n\nExchanges between Wiccan and Hulkling had led to speculation that the two teens had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship. Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly.\n\nKate advises that Asgardian should change his codename to avoid puns regarding his sexuality when the press discovers that he's in a relationship with Hulkling, implying that the others already knew the two are gay. Kate, along with Stature, suggested the codename, \"Wiccan,\" which Billy adopts.\n\nWhen the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell, Jessica Jones warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true. After some deliberation, the two decide to tell Farrell, with Teddy adding, \"Why should Northstar have all the fun?\"\n\nIn \"Young Avengers Presents\" #3, Hulkling and Wiccan's romantic relationship is handled much more openly than previous issues. In it, they refer to one another as boyfriends. Speed also asks if their relationship is \"getting hot and heavy\" and jokes that Billy and Teddy would have a disastrous \"mixed marriage\" due to Teddy's alien heritage.\n\nIn the aftermath of \"The Children's Crusade\", Billy falls into a months long depression, watching from the sidelines as New York is turned into \"Spider Island\" and the Human Torch is resurrected. Teddy is able to bring Billy back \"out of the dark\" by proposing to him.\n\nIn Young Avengers Vol. 2, Billy and Teddy's relationship is tested due to the meddling of Loki, who plants the idea in Teddy's head that he is not real and was unknowingly created by Billy using his reality warping powers. Teddy is kissed by Prodigy. The couple reconcile at the conclusion of the storyline and are last seen happily dancing together at Marvel Boy's party.\n\nIn \"New Avengers\", the hybrids refer to Teddy as Emperor Dorrek VIII and Billy as his \"prince consort\". A flashforward to possible future 20XX shows an older Billy and Teddy living happily together with a daughter, Katie.\n\nAsked about Billy's codename, Heinberg said \"It turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters. When Kate suggests 'Wiccan' to Billy in \"Young Avengers\" #6, she, like me, was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of Wicca, but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word 'witch.' It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with 'Wiccan.' And since adopting the code name, rest assured Billy has been doing his Wiccan homework, so keep reading...\" During their time fighting the Mother, Loki eventually questions Wiccan about his codename. He complains that since he is a pagan deity, he takes some offence to its use, and jokingly states that he has a list of better names.\n\nIn the pages of New Avengers, Power Man questions Billy over his choice of codename. Although he explains that he has been researching the religion of Wicca, he admits that it is not his faith. Victor then suggests that he should change it (with Teddy begging him not to revert to Asgardian). Billy later changes his name to Demiurge whilst under the control of the ghost wizard Moridun.\n\nWiccan has received generally positive reception, with particular focus on his relationship with Hulkling. Heinberg reported that when the relationship was initially suspected before its confirmation, most fan were supportive, with minimal negative reaction. Wiccan and Hulkling have been called \"Marvel's most prominent gay couple,\" and received praise for showing diversity and progression in comics. Writer Andrew Wheeler ranked the couple as #6 on a list of fifty comics and characters that LGBT readers have connected to. He wrote: \"Something about the sweetness of the love between Hulkling and Wiccan, aka Billy and Teddy, has struck a strong chord with readers looking for a little romance to melt their hearts. After dealing with time travellers, alien invasions and mad mutants, their story stands out as an It Gets Better for the superhero set.\" While accepting the Corporate Vanguard Award for Marvel Entertainment at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Marvel's VP of Animation Development, Cort Lane, cited Wiccan and Hulkling's relationship as one of his favorite story lines featuring LGBT characters.\n\nIn the one-shot Avengers Fairy Tales, Wiccan appears as the March Hare in an adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\nIn a reality where after the Hulk was jettisoned into space and discovered by Annihilus, killing him and taking the Annihilation Wave to Earth; Wiccan appears as one of the few remaining superhumans and part of Quentin Quire's Exiles. Like his mainstream counterpart, he refers to Speed as his brother and the Scarlet Witch as his mother.\n\nIn a one-shot story about the final Avengers story, Billy and Tommy grew up as the children of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. As a child, Billy witnessed the accidental murder of his mother by his uncle, Quicksilver. Her death eventually caused Billy (known as \"Billy Maximoff\") to become a villain, calling himself \"the Grim Reaper.\" He and his brother Tommy communicated via holograms where Tommy implored his brother to give up his villainy, stating that he was apprehensive to fight him. Eventually the Reaper joined forces with Kang and Ultron-59 and their \"final battle\" with the Avengers. Billy appeared to be friends with this future's Oddball and the two discussed Billy's desire for revenge against his brother and father.\n\nBilly and his brother were locked in battle until their father, the Vision, destroyed Ultron, ending the fight. As the Vision lay dying, he implored Billy not to give up on humanity the way he had when Wanda was killed. What exactly became of Billy following the Avengers' victory is unknown.\n\nUnlike Earth-616, Tommy inherited their mother's mystical abilities and the nature of Billy's powers were unspecified. As the Grim Reaper, Billy wielded a scythe of unknown nature, either technological or mystic, that could teleport back to him if it left his hand. The scythe could presumably cut what he wanted it to while harmlessly phasing through what he did not, such as when he impaled Jessie Wingfoot without injuring Ultron-59. During the battle with Tommy, his scythe was able to deflect mystical force bolts conjured at him.\n\nDuring \"Battle of the Atom\", Billy is seen as a member of the future X-Men who travel back in time to stop a group of impostors led by Beast. He is the Earth's new Sorcerer Supreme, and possesses the Eye of Agamotto.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, Wiccan and his twin brother are the twins of Wanda Magnus.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2082958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082958", "title": "Wheel bug", "text": "Wheel bug\n\nThe wheel bug (\"Arilus cristatus\") is a species of large assassin bug in the family Reduviidae (literally, \"hangnail\"). The species is one of the largest terrestrial true bugs in North America, reaching up to in length in their adult stage. They are sexually dimorphic, in that males are somewhat smaller than the females. A characteristic structure is the wheel-shaped pronotal armor. Wheel bugs prey on caterpillars and beetles, such as Japanese beetles, the cabbage worm, orange dogs, tent caterpillars, and the Mexican bean beetle, all of which they pierce with their beak to inject salivary fluids that dissolve soft tissue. Wheel bugs are most active in daylight, though they may engage in predatory behaviors at night in areas illuminated by lights. Because most of their prey are pests, wheel bugs are considered beneficial.\n\nThey are camouflaged and very shy, residing in leafy areas and hiding whenever possible. Specifically, habitats of the wheel bug include sunflowers, goldenrod, cotton, trunks of locust trees, and various fruit and tree groves. They have membranous wings, allowing for clumsy, noisy flight which can easily be mistaken for the flight of a large grasshopper. The adult is gray to brownish gray in color and black shortly after molting, but the nymphs (which do not yet have the wheel-shaped structure) have bright red or orange abdomens. It was described in 1763 by Carl Linnaeus. Despite the prevalence of the wheel bug in many habitats, the information compiled concerning the species is haphazard and incomplete.\n\nThe wheel bug has a characteristic dorsal crest, shaped like a wheel or cog. It moves and flies slowly, and in flight produces a noisy buzzing sound. As with other assassin bugs, its proboscis arises from the anterior end of its long, tubular head and unfolds forward when feeding.\n\nIt possesses two scent glands (red-orange in color) that can be ejected from its abdomen, usually in reaction to being disturbed. The scent produced by it is not as powerful as that produced by stink bugs, but is still strong enough to be detected by humans.\n\nWheel bugs exhibit armored forewings and membranous hind wings which allow the wheel bug to take flight. As a result of its inability to move swiftly, wheel bugs rely heavily upon camouflage, the effect of their bite, or the production of unpleasant odors in order to avoid predation.\n\nWheel bugs are most common in eastern Canada and the United States, and their range extends into Mexico and Guatemala. Among the four species of \"Arilus\", a western hemisphere genus, only \"A. cristatus\" is found in the United States.\n\nWheel bugs initiate predation by gripping and pinning their prey with their front legs. The bug plunges its beak into its victim before injecting it with enzymes, paralyzing it and dissolving its insides, and proceeds to drain the resulting fluids.\n\nThe wheel bug is also noted to be very aggressive in the wild, and cannibalistic behaviors between them have been noted; for example, nymphs may prey on one another and the female may feed on the male after mating is concluded.\n\nAdditionally, like many reduviids, the species is capable of producing audible sound by rubbing the tip of its proboscis in a groove under its thorax. The purpose of this sound is unknown and may serve as a means of communication between members of the species.\n\nThe reproductive cycle of the wheel bug initiates in autumn. After mating, the female will lay 40-200 small, brown, cylindrical eggs, and eventually die. Females lay eggs on trees, bushes, twigs, and other objects. Secreted glue serves as an adhesive which maintains the cluster formation of the eggs. The eggs will hatch in the following spring into eight millimeter long red nymphs, which will undergo 5 molts until they reach the adult stage the following summer.\n\nAfter the nymphs hatch, the average length of each molt is roughly 18.8 days, though the interval of the 5th and final molt prior to the adult stage is the longest. Eggs generally hatch in the beginning of May and finally mature into adults by July. Overall, it takes roughly 94 days for nymphs to reach maturity. However, the phenology of this life cycle varies based upon the climate which the population occupies. For instance, communities in warm climates may not overwinter as eggs.\n\nIn a laboratory test conducted at Southern Illinois University in 1997 and 1998, research revealed that the species’ eggs may be attacked by parasitic wasps, such as \"Ooencyrtus johnsoni\". Of the 12 clusters of eggs monitored in the lab, 10 were ravaged by parasites which prevented the eggs from hatching normally.\n\nWheel bugs are predatory immediately upon hatching, but the distinctive wheel unique to the species derives only after the bug reaches the adult stage following the final molt.\n\nWheel bugs are highly regarded by organic gardeners because they consume a variety of insects and their presence indicates a healthy, pesticide-free ecosystem. \"They're the lion or the eagle of your food web,\" Dr. Michael J. Raupp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland, notes. \"They sit on top. When you have these big, ferocious predators in your landscape, that tells me that this is a very healthy landscape, because all these other levels in your food web are intact.\"\n\nThough wheel bugs are a welcome agent of pest control, they also prey on several ecologically beneficial species, such as lady beetles and honey bees.\n\nThe species is generally indifferent concerning the presence and interruption of humans. Although evidence suggests that wheel bugs can seemingly be domesticated in controlled environments, if provoked or mishandled, they may attack in an act of defense. As a cautionary warning, the bite of a wheel bug is generally considered to be of greater severity in terms of the level and duration of pain than the sting of common insects such as wasps. The resulting wound is documented to be extremely painful, lasting, and lingering, accompanied by an unceasing numbness which can persist for days. These effects can be avoided by handling the docile insect with gloves. The bite is not considered highly venomous, so is not serious in the short term. Furthermore, the vicinity of the injury is known to become heated and irritated. A white crust sometimes forms around the wound during the healing process, though it eventually deteriorates, leaving the small puncture wound visible. Discomfort may persist for 2 weeks and up to 6 months in some cases. However the latter timeline is frequently attributed to allergic reactions or recurrent infections of the original wound.\n"}

He is the scion of a distinguished family, as a son of Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau (a former Deputy Prime Minister and one of modern Fiji's founding fathers), and brother of Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, who has served as President of Fiji since 2009.\n\nIn the parliamentary election of 1999, Cokanauto, a candidate of the Fijian Association Party (FAP), won the Tailevu North Ovalau Open constituency on a recount, having failed to win on the initial count by a mere two votes. Although the FAP was part of the victorious People's Coalition, Cokanauto was not included in the new Cabinet announced by Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. Following disagreements over the party's nominations to the Senate and the style of leadership, Cokanauto challenged Deputy Prime Minister and Fijian Affairs Minister Adi Kuini Speed for the leadership of the party on 11 September 1999. He initially ousted her, but the High Court subsequently ruled in Speed's favour. A vote to resolve the impasse narrowly confirmed Speed as leader, and Cokanauto and his supporters moved to the Opposition benches in January 2000, forming a breakaway faction of the FAP.\n\nFollowing the failure of the coup, Cokanauto was appointed on 19 July 2000 to the Cabinet of interim Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, as Minister for Local Government, Housing, and the Environment. His brother, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Fijian Affairs in the same government.\n\nIn the general election held to restore democracy in September 2001, Cokanauto stood as an independent candidate. He was defeated by Josefa Vosanibola, the candidate of Qarase's party, the \"Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua.\"\n\nAs of June 2005, Cokanauto was serving as a director of the Native Land Trust Board, which administered the 83 percent of the land that was communally owned by indigenous Fijians.\n"}
{"id": "2082964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082964", "title": "1999 Stanley Cup Finals", "text": "1999 Stanley Cup Finals\n\nThe 1999 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1998–99 season, and the culmination of the 1999 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Eastern Conference champion Buffalo Sabres and the Western Conference champion Dallas Stars. It was the 106th year of the Stanley Cup being contested.\n\nThe Sabres were led by captain Michael Peca, head coach Lindy Ruff and goaltender Dominik Hasek. The Stars were led by captain Derian Hatcher, head coach Ken Hitchcock and goaltender Ed Belfour. It was the Sabres' second Stanley Cup Final appearance; the first was a loss to Philadelphia in 1975. It was the third appearance for the Stars' franchise, and their first since moving to Dallas from Minnesota in 1993. Minnesota (known at the time as the North Stars) lost in the Final to the New York Islanders in 1981 and to Pittsburgh in 1991. The Stars defeated the Sabres four games to two to win their first Stanley Cup, becoming the eighth post-1967 expansion team to earn a championship, and the first Southern team to win the Cup. \n\nThis was the first time since 1994 that the Stanley Cup Finals did not end in a sweep. It is the Stars' only Stanley Cup win, while Buffalo has not returned to the Finals since. Dallas returned to the Finals in 2000 but lost to the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe series ended with a controversial triple-overtime goal in game six, when replays showed that Stars forward Brett Hull scored with his skate in the crease. Despite the Sabres' protests to the contrary, the league stated that the goal was good, as Hull had maintained possession of the puck as it exited the crease just before he shot it.\n\nBuffalo defeated the Ottawa Senators 4–0, the Boston Bruins 4–2 and Toronto Maple Leafs 4–1 to advance to the final.\n\nDallas defeated the Edmonton Oilers 4–0, the St. Louis Blues 4–2 and the Colorado Avalanche 4–3 to advance to the final.\n\nThis was the third time that Big Four teams from the Dallas and Buffalo metro areas faced each other for a championship, all in the 1990s (the Cowboys beat the Bills in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII).\n\nThe opening game was in Dallas and it was the visiting Buffalo Sabres who struck first, winning 3–2 in overtime. Dallas led 1-0 on a power play goal by Brett Hull, but Stu Barnes and Wayne Primeau scored 5:04 apart in the third to give Buffalo a 2–1 lead. Jere Lehtinen tied the game in the final minute of the third period, but Jason Woolley scored at 15:30 of overtime to give the Sabres the series lead.\n\nDallas struck back in the second game, winning 4–2. Dallas attempted to rattle Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek in the first period, as Brian Skrudland was assessed a charging minor after running Hasek, who had gone into the corner to his right to play the puck, at 12:25 of the first period. With three seconds left in the period, Dallas center Mike Modano tripped Hasek away from the play in almost the same spot, and a number of scrums broke out as time expired. Dallas winger Joe Nieuwendyk—who had been \"freight-trained\" (in the words of Fox play-by-play man Mike Emrick) into the boards by Buffalo center Brian Holzinger with seven seconds left in one of a series of big hits—dropped the gloves and fought Holzinger in the circle to the right of Hasek. These were the first fighting majors in three years in the final round, and it was also Nieuwendyk's first fighting major in five years in either the playoffs or regular season. Nieuwendyk's decision to drop the gloves—so out-of-character for him—seemed to inspire the team and was one of the reasons he eventually won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1999.\n\nAfter the scoreless opening period, the teams traded goals in the middle frame. Craig Ludwig's first goal in 102 playoff games gave Dallas its first lead of the game in the third period, but Alexei Zhitnik tied it 71 seconds later. Brett Hull scored on a slap shot, a one-timer on a pass from Tony Hrkac, from the top of the circle to Hasek's left with 2:50 remaining in the game, but Buffalo had an excellent chance to tie the game with Derian Hatcher being assessed a high-sticking minor 19 seconds later. During the power play, Buffalo pulled Hasek for a 6-on-4 attacking advantage, but the Stars were able to kill the penalty, and Hatcher scored an empty-netter just three seconds after emerging from the penalty box. The empty net goal sealed the win for Dallas, and evened the series at one game apiece. Mike Modano left the game with approximately ten minutes to play after suffering a broken wrist.\n\nThe series shifted to Buffalo for games three and four. It was the visiting Dallas Stars turn to win one on the road, winning 2–1. With Modano hampered by his wrist injury, and Hull leaving the game with a groin injury, Joe Nieuwendyk's two goals, including his sixth game-winner of the playoffs, led Dallas to the win.\n\nFacing a two games to one deficit in the series, the Sabres came through with a 2–1 victory.\n\nWith the series tied at two games apiece and returning to Dallas, Ed Belfour made 23 saves to shut out the Sabres, and move Dallas within one win of the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe series shifted back to Marine Midland Arena for the sixth game on June 19, 1999, where the Dallas Stars would seek their first Stanley Cup, while the Buffalo Sabres would fight for a win to extend the series to a seventh and final game.\n\nDallas, which allowed the first goal in the earlier two games played at Marine Midland Arena, took a 1–0 lead on one of its few scoring chances in the first period when Lehtinen scored his tenth goal of the playoffs at 8:09. The Sabres tied the game with their first goal since the third period of game four when Barnes' wrist shot eluded Belfour with 1:39 to play in the second period.\n\nThe game remained tied at one through the third period and the first two overtime periods, despite several chances by both teams to score. At 14:51 of the third overtime period, Brett Hull scored to end the series and win Dallas their first Stanley Cup.\n\nIt was the longest Cup-winning game in Finals history, and the second-longest Finals game overall, after game one of the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals, which ended at 15:13 of the third overtime.\n\nIn the third overtime, Brett Hull took a shot from just outside the crease that was stopped by Dominick Hasek. Hull was not in the crease for the first shot. The rebound came near Hull's left skate, which Hull used to kick the puck to his stick, which was just outside the crease. His left skate entered the crease just before his second shot went in and ended the series.\n\nNone of the Sabres players or coaches questioned the legality of the goal in the immediate aftermath. It was not until league commissioner Gary Bettman was on the ice to hand out the trophies that Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff returned to his bench and began screaming at Bettman to explain why the goal had not been reviewed. In the Sabres' locker room, players who had seen the replays were infuriated. Hasek recalled, \"My first reaction was 'Let's get back on the ice.' But it's 2 o'clock in the morning and I look at everyone and it's like, 'I'm already out of my pants. It's impossible.'\"\n\nThe NHL had sent a private memo out earlier in the season with a clarification to the in-the-crease rule. The memo stated that if a player was in control of the puck, a skate could be in the crease even if the puck was not, and a goal in that circumstance would count. NHL Director of Officiating Bryan Lewis said after the game that the goal had been reviewed, just as every goal that season had been, and the officials in the video review booth had determined that since Hull was deemed to have been in possession of the puck throughout the play, he was allowed to shoot and score a goal, even though one skate had entered the crease before the puck.\n\nAmong Sabres fans, both the game and the play itself are often simply referred to as \"No Goal\".\n\nBolded years under Final appearance indicates year won Stanley Cup.\n\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC. In the United States, this was fifth and final year in which coverage of the Cup Finals was split between Fox and ESPN. Fox aired games one, two, and five; while ESPN had games three, four, and six. Had there been a game seven, it would have aired on Fox. Under the U.S. TV contracts that would take effect beginning next season, ABC would take over for Fox as the NHL's network television partner.\n\nThe following year, the Dallas Stars successfully returned to the Stanley Cup Finals. At that time, they faced the New Jersey Devils but lost in six games. As for the Buffalo Sabres, they lost in the first round to the Philadelphia Flyers in five games.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2082987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082987", "title": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara", "text": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara\n\nCombining the side-scrolling gameplay of a beat 'em up with some aspects found in a role-playing video game, \"Shadow over Mystara\" has many game mechanics not commonly found in arcade games, such as finding and equipping new gear and earning new spells as the player gains experience. Players can wield a large variety of weapons and armor, although this selection is limited by the character the players chooses; there is also an extensive assortment of magical and hidden items in the game, many of which are completely unknown to exist to the typical video gamer. This, along with the addition of multiple endings and forking paths, gives the game much re-playability and has led to a cult following among fans of the genre.\n\nIt was one of the last 2-D arcade side-scrollers created by Capcom; only \"Battle Circuit\" (1997) came after \"Shadow over Mystara\". The game has seen two home releases as part of the compilations: \"Dungeons & Dragons Collection\" published for the Sega Saturn in 1999, and \"\" made available on the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam in 2013.\n\nIn addition to the original four heroes found in its predecessor, \"\" (Cleric, Dwarf, Elf and Fighter), \"Shadow of Mystara\" adds a Thief and a Magic-User to the selection. Furthermore, with the inclusion of two separate versions of each character's sprite set, the game allows up to two players to select the same character (in \"Tower of Doom\" each of the characters could only be selected once), effectively giving the game 12 \"different\" characters to choose from. The two Clerics and two Magic Users also have subtle differences within their spell books.\n\nThe controls use four buttons: Attack, Jump, Select (brings up a small inventory ring around the character allowing the player to choose what item is set in the Use slot) and Use. The Cleric, Elf and Magic-User also have two extra rings for their spells, with the Jump button used to switch from ring to ring. While the game uses the same kick harness as the previous game, the Select and Use buttons are reversed.\n\n\"Shadow over Mystara\" also introduced a selection of special moves which are executed by moving the joystick and tapping the buttons in certain combinations, in a way similar to the \"Street Fighter\" series. The characters (except for the Magic-User) have a Dashing Attack as well as a Rising Attack which can be used to combo monsters or even juggle them in the air. Most characters (again, with the exception of the Magic-User and also Cleric) also have a Megacrush, a move common to nearly all of Capcom side-scrollers, which damages all enemies standing close enough to the character but in turn also damaging the player themselves.\n\nPlayers, as they fight their way through each level, will come across an assortment of treasure. Treasure is found in chests, stolen from monsters, dropped from dead enemies and bosses, or even found simply lying on the ground. Most treasure is gold and silver, which is used to buy simple items in shops (see below), or precious gems, which add to a heroes experience points. Other treasure include weapons and equipment. Treasure on the ground is picked up by standing near it and pressing the Attack button. Due to this feature, characters that stand too close to loot while fighting will instead bend down and retrieve the nearby item. It was very difficult to fight monsters in room full of treasure in \"Tower of Doom\", and Capcom addressed these complaints with the addition of sliding. This maneuver allows players to automatically pick up any treasure and equipment a hero slides over, quickly clearing the area of items.\n\nThe game offers a small selection of arcane magic, available for the Magic-User and Elf, and divine magic, available to the Cleric. Instead of an MP system, characters use \"D&D\"'s Vancian magic system where a certain amount of each spell ready to cast. Extra uses of the spells can be picked up off the ground, represented graphically as scrolls of paper, or occasionally recharged after certain boss fights. When a spell is cast the entire game is momentarily paused during which the spell effect is played out (some spells can be controlled during this time).\n\nEvery character starts with their armor (the second slot) already filled, specific to their character, and remains unchanged the entire game. The character's helmet (the first slot) and shield (the fifth slot) are the other two items that lend to a character's defensive ability. Most characters also begin with a shield, except the Magic-User and Thief, who cannot use shields. While magical items in traditional \"D&D\" rules are practically invulnerable or tough, the magical items in \"Shadow over Mystara\" are very fragile. Magical boots (slot three), gauntlets (slot four), and rings (slot six) are all destroyed after the player is damaged a few times. The eighth slot is used for miscellaneous items, such as the \"Skin of the Displacer Beast\" or the \"Eye of the Beholder\"; many bosses drop rare items such as these and they either grant special abilities or can be traded in for special magical equipment. There are also many unique hidden items (for example, hidden near the end of the game is a treasure chest which contains the Staff of Wizardry when opened by the Magic-User: if the Magic-User wields the staff during the final boss fight and there are at least three players with a combined total of over 1 million experience points, the Staff will glow and the team will be able to use the powerful Final Strike attack).\n\nIn between many stages the players find themselves inside small town stores where they can restock on common items such as arrows, burning oils, throwing daggers and healing potions. Players can sell items for gold and also trade special items found during boss battles with shopkeepers (by clicking on the shopkeepers head) to earn unique magical items. The players can also come across a special gnome village where the townfolk beg to be saved from a chimera (the gnomes, unlike traditional \"Dungeons & Dragons\" gnomes, are very minuscule, standing about a foot tall).\n\n\"Shadow over Mystara\" contains a system which allows the players to name their characters. Abusing this system using methods involving typing a space as the first character of the name, followed by a long string of repeated letters, cause the game to become incredibly glitched, giving the players powerful items in the beginning of the game. This exploit also has a nasty side effect of causing the game to have an incredible amount of visual bugs (flickering sprites, missing sprites and mistakes in the text) and often causes the game to reboot, or worse, to freeze up. Arcade owners, unaware that the players themselves were the cause of the troubles, would often shut down the machine for repair or simply remove the game completely. Gamers on the Internet, aware of these consequences, would often refuse to post instructions on how to activate the glitch. Revision 2 of the game prevented the use of this bug.\n\nA less dangerous glitch, known commonly as \"\"Highlander\" Mode\", allows the Magic-User and Thief to become more or less immune to all damage. Players must simply swap their default headgear to use the exploit—any Magic-User wearing a Hood (the Thief's default hat) or any Thief that wears a Magician's Hat (the Magic-User's starting hat) cannot be killed from any standard damage in the game (the character \"will\" be reduced to 1 hit point but \"will not\" be killed). Some examples of non-standard damage that can still drop the player below 1 hit point are bite attacks, breath weapons, treasure chests thrown by allies, and spells. This bug was never addressed in the arcade.\n\nAfter defeating the Arch Lich Deimos, the heroes continued on their journey through the Broken Lands of Glantri after realizing that Deimos is only part of an even greater evil plan, and he was in fact being used by a mysterious sorceress named Synn. Synn, who appears to be a young woman but commands incredibly powerful magical abilities, has been scheming to control the Kingdom of Glantri and conquer the humanoids of the Republic of Darokin. But now that Deimos has been defeated, Synn vowed to punish the land that she desired.\n\nAt the game's end the player discovers that Synn is in fact a centuries-old huge red dragon, bent on harnessing the mystical forces of the lands she has conquered, in order to awaken a creature of even more devastating physical prowess than herself - known and described only as The Fiend. The heroes then fight against Synn in her lair; when she is slain, her monster is also destroyed by airship bombing.\n\nAfter the heroes beat the final boss, each member of the group is treated to a short epilogue detailing his or her future exploits. Endings are titled with a simple code: the first letter of the character class followed by the number of the ending. Therefore, the Cleric's second ending is called \"C-2\", the Fighter's best ending is named \"F-1\", and so forth. There are four separate endings per character class and the hero earns an ending based on multiple factors that are specific to the character's class above ?-3 endings. With the exception of the Dwarf and Cleric, characters can receive a ?-3 ending if they have collected at least 3000 SP. All character classes have a message based on having struck the final blow to Synn, but it is not always their ?-1 ending. Several classes have endings based on beating the game while wielding a weapon or simply having it in their inventory, including the Battle Axe, the Sling, or the Sword of Legend, among others. Higher numbered endings can be achieved without meeting the requirements for lower numbered endings.\n\n\nPlayers, upon completion of their first stage, are prompted to enter a character name. Unlike many games at the time which only allow a person to enter three letters, \"Shadow over Mystara\" has space for six. The game provides a default name for each of the characters; the default name is also automatically used if the player tries to submit a blank name or use vulgarity.\n\nThe arcade version of the game was released in 1996. The guide/art book was published by Shinseisha in the \"Gamest Mook\" series that same year.\n\nIn 1999, Capcom compiled both \"D&D\" arcade games as \"Dungeons & Dragons Collection\", released for the Sega Saturn in Japan only. Although, graphically, the games are basically identical to their arcade counterparts, due to the limitations of the Saturn there is a maximum of two players instead of the original four. Furthermore, there are minor modifications to many areas of gameplay, such as changes in spell damage and the removal of certain software bugs.\n\nCapcom announced at PAX East 2013 that they would release \"Tower of Doom\" and \"Shadow over Mystara\" as part of the \"Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara\" HD compilation on Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe game has been very well received. A preview in \"VideoGames\" praised the game's \"astounding\" graphical details and called it \"Capcom's latest masterpiece\". On release, a reviewer for \"Next Generation\" said it \"is full of the stuff that made the first so fun.\" He further said that the game had refined \"Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom\", improving the animation quality to \"\" level, expanding the number of playable characters, adding more stage branches and endings to create deeper gameplay and story, and incorporating more interesting character abilities such as wielding two swords. Despite this, he gave it only three out of five stars.\n\nAccording to GameSpy in 2004, \"\"Shadows Over Mystara\" was a stellar game back when arcades were still a good place to find the hottest games. And it's still fun today.\" In 2011, GameSpy ranked it #50 on their list of the top arcade games, calling it \"one of the most purely entertaining titles ever released for any platform.\" In 2013, it was ranked as the 18th top beat 'em up video game of all time by Heavy.com, and included among the best looking beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era by Kotaku. \"Retro Gamer\" ranked it as the 16th top retro arcade game. IGN ranked \"Shadow Over Mystara\" No. 9 on their list of \"The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time\" in 2014.\n\n\n"}

Around the Formigas Reserve, including the Dollabarat, sea cliffs fall rapidly between , although gently to the north and south. The gradient around the Dollabarat is less accentuated.\n\nThe highest point is below sea level. Dollabarat Reef is one of the higher parts of the Formigas Bank, a seamount with similar volcanic origins as the Azores islands. The reef was formed from rocks emerging from volcanic activity in submarine volcanoes and deeper spaces composed of drained lava holes with an irregular morphology. The deeper parts of the Dollabarat are covered with large rocks and irregular plains covered with a carpet of seaweeds.\n\nGiven the relatively shallow waters, the reef is a peril to navigation, similar to sandy shorelines. \n\nThe strong currents, deep waters, and presence of sharks make diving difficult for those not familiar with open-ocean diving. The sub-tidal zone is a shelter for many fish species, and the abundance of black coral located about deep in the eastern part of the reef has resulted in a small reef habitat.\n\nThere is a large abundance of sea animals in the vicinity. In addition to species of sharks, other aquatic animals such as sea chub, trigger fish, mantas, turtles and dolphins have been observed in the waters around Dollabarat, including the Atlantic goliath grouper (usually found in depths between 10–40 m). The floor of the seamount is generally covered by a dense layer of seaweed, dominated by the \"Cystoseira\" species, a seaweed found in deeper areas. In shallower depths less than from the surface there are populations of \"Laminaria\" (large colonies of chestnut seaweeds). The Department of Oceanography and Fisheries at the University of the Azores (Ponta Delgada) monitors and studies these species annually through scientific missions to the reef and surrounding islets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2082992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082992", "title": "Electricity sector in Canada", "text": "Electricity sector in Canada\n\nThe electricity sector in Canada has played a significant role in the economic and political life of the country since the late 19th century. The sector is organized along provincial and territorial lines. In a majority of provinces, large government-owned integrated public utilities play a leading role in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Ontario and Alberta have created electricity markets in the last decade in order to increase investment and competition in this sector of the economy.\n\nHydroelectricity accounted for 59% of all electric generation in Canada in 2016, making Canada the world's second-largest producer of hydroelectricity after China. Since 1960, large hydroelectric projects, especially in Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador, have significantly increased the country's generation capacity.\n\nThe second-largest single source of power (15% of the total) is nuclear power, with several plants in Ontario generating more than half of that province's electricity, and one generator in New Brunswick. This makes Canada the world's sixth-largest producer of electricity generated by nuclear power, producing 95 TWh in 2017.\n\nFossil fuels provide 19% of Canadian electric power, about half as coal (9% of the total) and the remainder a mix of natural gas and oil. Only five provinces use coal for electricity generation. Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia rely on coal for nearly half their generation while other provinces and territories use little or none. Alberta and Saskatchewan also use a substantial amount of natural gas. Remote communities including all of Nunavut and much of the Northwest Territories produce most of their electricity from diesel generators, at high economic and environmental cost. The federal government has set up initiatives to reduce dependence on diesel-fired electricity. Due to this portion, the electricity sector accounted for 10% of total national greenhouse gas emissions in 2017.\n\nNon-hydro renewables are a fast-growing portion of the total, at 7% in 2016. Notably, Prince Edward Island generates nearly all its electricity via wind power.\n\nCanada has substantial electricity trade with the neighbouring United States amounting to 72 TWh exports and 10 TWh imports in 2017.\n\nCanadian homes, offices and factories are large users of electricity, or \"hydro\", as it is often called in many regions of Canada. In 2007, Canadian per capita power consumption was among the highest in the world, with an average of 16,995 kWh per annum.\n\nElectricity has been significant for Canada's economy and politics since the late 19th century. In the 1890s, three firms competed to develop the Canadian Niagara Falls. After the First World War, the provincial utilities were created. The public companies focused on rural electrification and hydroelectric development.\n\nThe electricity sector in Canada is organized along provincial and territorial lines as part of their jurisdiction over natural resources. All provinces and territories have set up utilities boards and regulate transmission and distribution rates.\n\nThe liberalization process of the 1990s changed some parameters such as the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution functions of incumbent utilities in order to foster a competitive wholesale market or, as in the cases of large exporters like Quebec and British Columbia, to comply with Order 888 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other U.S. market rules. Most provincial governments still maintain a strong financial stake as operators in the electrical markets.\n\nIn a majority of provinces and territories, utilities are vertically integrated Crown corporations operating as regulated monopolies. This is by and large the case in New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Nunavut. A second model involves a Crown corporation as a large generator or in transmission, alongside an investor-owned distributor, as in Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and, to a lesser degree, Prince Edward Island. Nova Scotia has granted a virtual monopoly to Nova Scotia Power, when it divested its investments in the sector in 1992. However, there remain half a dozen small public electric distributors - the Municipal Electric Utilities of Nova Scotia who have the right to buy power from other parties, or generate their own. NS has a feed-in tariff program to encourage smaller generators. \n\nTwo provinces, Ontario and Alberta, have deregulated their electric industry to different degrees over the last decade. Both provinces operate electricity markets, but there are significant differences between the two systems. The Ontario market is a hybrid, with the Ontario Power Authority (now merged with the IESO) \"contracting for supply, integrated system planning, and regulated pricing for much of Ontario's generation and load\". In Alberta, the generation business is competitive, while transmission and distribution are rate-regulated.\n\nA number of municipalities operate local distribution systems. Some of them, such as EPCOR in Edmonton, are also significant players in the power generation business, under their name or through their control of publicly traded companies.\n\nThe federal government, through the National Energy Board, issues permits for inter-provincial and international power lines. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has jurisdiction over nuclear safety. Ottawa and the provinces share jurisdiction over environmental issues such as air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Also, major hydroelectric developments trigger federal environmental assessment processes, as the Government of Canada has the power to regulate waterways and fisheries.\n\nEnergy-intensive businesses, such as the aluminium smelting and pulp and paper industries have made significant investments over time in power generation. One such company is Rio Tinto Alcan, which owns and operates 7 hydroelectric generating stations in Quebec and British Columbia, with a combined installed capacity of 3,300 MW.\n\nIn recent years, partial or complete deregulation of the wholesale generation business have created a number of Independent Power Producers, who build and operate power plants and sell over the long term, through power purchase agreements — with terms of up to 35 years — and in day-ahead and hour-ahead transactions, where such markets exist.\n\nIn 2013, Canada generated 651.8 terawatt-hours (TWh), a 10% increase since 2003. Approximately 822 generating stations are scattered from the Atlantic to the Pacific, for a nameplate capacity of 130,543 MW. The 100 largest generating stations in Canada have a combined capacity of 100,829 MW. In comparison, the total installed capacity of Canada was 111,000 MW in 2000.\n\nIn 2013, the leading type of power generation by utilities in Canada is hydroelectricity, with a share of 60.1%. Nuclear (15.8%), natural gas (10.3%), coal (10%), wind (1.8%), fuel oil (1.2%), biofuels and waste (0.\n8%), wood (0.4%) and solar (0.1%) follow. Other sources, such as petroleum coke make up the remaining 0.5%.\n\nHowever, these figures do not account for the variety of provincial generation mixes. Historic producers of coal, like Alberta (66.9%), Nova Scotia (58.2%), and Saskatchewan (54.8%) have come to rely mainly on coal-fired generating stations. In hydro-rich provinces, such as Manitoba (99.5%), Quebec (97.2%), Newfoundland and Labrador (97.1%), and British Columbia (88.7%), hydroelectric power accounts for the bulk of all electric generation.\n\nIn Canada's most populated province, Ontario Hydro has developed 11,990 MW of nuclear capacity between 1966 and 1993, building 20 CANDU reactors at 3 sites: Pickering, Darlington and Bruce. New Brunswick and by extension, Prince Edward Island, which buys 96% of its power from the neighbouring province, has a diversified mix, including a nuclear reactor and hydroelectric dams. However, the province is dependent on expensive fuel oil generation.\n\nThe electrical generating capacities of the provinces and territories in Canada are broken down below. Numbers are given in megawatts (MW) and gigawatt-hours (GWh). The tables below use 2010 data from Statistics Canada.\n\nNote: Ontario eliminated coal in 2014.\n\nIn 2009 the Canadian production of electricity was 18,566 kWh per person and domestic use about 94% of production (17,507 kWh/person). In 2008 the OECD average was 8,991 kWh/person. 64.5% of Canadian domestic electricity use was produced with the renewable sources. The non renewable electricity use, i.e. fossil and nuclear, in Canada in 2009 was 6,213 kWh/person, respectively in UK 5,579; Germany 5,811; Denmark 4,693; Spain 4,553; Finland 11,495 and the United States 12,234.\n\nThe Canadian transmission networks extend over . The grids generally follow north-south orientations since most population centres in Canada are concentrated in southern regions along the American border while the largest hydroelectric and nuclear projects are located in sparsely inhabited areas to the north. This particular situation forced Canadian utilities to innovate. In November 1965, Hydro-Québec commissioned the first 735-kV AC power line linking the Manic-Outardes project to the Lévis substation. In 1972, Manitoba Hydro connected generating stations part of the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project to the Winnipeg area through a high-voltage direct current power line, the Nelson River Bipole.\n\nThe Canadian transmission networks are largely integrated to the US power grid. There is greater integration and trade with the US than there is between Canada's provinces. The transmission utilities of provinces sharing a border with the United States are taking part in regional reliability organizations such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC); the Maritime provinces, Quebec and Ontario are part of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) with utilities in New England and in New York State, Manitoba participates in the Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), while Alberta and British Columbia are linked to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC).\n\nUtilities across Canada are making large investments in the maintenance of ageing infrastructure and in the construction of new power lines and substations to connect new generation sources to the bulk power system. For instance, Ontario is spending $2.3 billion on a series of transmission projects aimed at connecting new renewable capacity fostered by the Green Energy Act. In Alberta, the AESO is recommending the construction of a $1.83 billion, 240 kV looped system in the southern part of the province to integrate up to 2,700 MW of new wind generation. In Quebec, Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie filed a $1.47 billion investment plan to connect 2,000 MW of new wind generation scheduled to come on-stream between 2011 and 2015.\n\nAlberta was the first Canadian province to implement a deregulated electricity market. The market was established in 1996, following the adoption of the \"Electric Utility Act\", the year before. Local distribution utilities, either investor- or municipally owned, retained the obligation to supply and the 6 largest utilities were assigned a share of the output of existing generators at a fixed price. The province moved to full retail access in 2001 and a spot market, under the Alberta Electric System Operator, was established in 2003. After consumers complained about high prices in 2000, the government implemented a Regulated Rate Option (RRO), as a means to shield consumers from price volatility.\n\nThe generation sector in Alberta is dominated by TransAlta, ENMAX, and Capital Power Corporation, a spin-off of Edmonton's municipally owned company EPCOR. Although 5,700 MW of new generation was added and 1,470 of old plants were retired between 1998 and 2009, coal still accounted for 73.8% of utility-generated power in 2007, followed by natural gas, with 20.6%.\n\nInstalled capacity reached 12,834 MW in 2009, with coal (5,692 MW) and natural gas (5,189 MW) representing the bulk of the province's generation fleet. Recent additions to the grid have increased wind capacity to 657 MW, while hydroelectric capacity stands at 900 MW. Despite tougher new emission measures announced by the federal government in June 2010, industry officials believed the province will continue using coal to generate electricity into 2050. In November 2015, the government announced a coal phase-out by 2030. Syncrude's Mildred Lake and Aurora North Plant Sites, the coal fired Sundance Power Station and the coal fired Genesee Generating Station are the top three sources of greenhouse gases in Canada.\n\nBC Hydro was created in 1961 when the government of British Columbia, under Premier W. A. C. Bennett, passed the BC Hydro Act. This act led to the amalgamation of BC Electric Company and the BC Power Commission, and the creation of the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BCHPA). \nBC Hydro is the main electric distributor, serving 1.8 million customers in most areas, with the exception of the Kootenay region, where FortisBC, a subsidiary of Fortis Inc. directly provides electric service to 111,000 customers and supplies municipally owned utilities in the same area.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1984, BC Hydro completed six large hydro-electric generating projects, including the 2,730 MW W. A. C. Bennett Dam and Gordon M. Shrum Generating Station and Peace Canyon on the Peace River, Mica and Revelstoke on the Columbia River, Kootenay Canal on the Kootenay River and Seven Mile Dam, on the Pend d'Oreille River.\n\nA third dam and 900 MW generating station on the Peace River, the Site C dam near Fort St. John, has been discussed for decades and was rejected in the early 1990s. In April 2010, the British Columbia government announced moving the project to a regulatory review phase. A notice of Site C construction commencing in 2015 was issued July 2015. Revelstoke Dam built in 1984 was the last new dam built by BC Hydro.\n\nThe province's Liberal government has promoted the construction of a slew of small-scale hydro projects by private businesses. As of April 2010, 63 long-term power purchase agreements have been signed with Independent Power Producers for 2,629 MW of capacity and 10.3 TWh of energy.\n\nIn 2015 Hydropower made up 87% of total generation, the rest being biomass, wind and some natural gas.\n\nBC Hydro via Powerex trades electricity eastward with Alberta and south to all of the western US through the Pacific-Intertie. In 2014 BC had the largest volume of electricity imports in Canada (9700 Mwh), from the Western Interconnection in the US which is 60% fossil fueled. BC Hydro typically imports power during off-peak hours when thermal plants in the US and Alberta have excess power for sale, Then exports hydropower during peak hours when prices are higher.\n\nManitoba Hydro is the crown corporation in charge of electricity generation, transmission and distribution in Manitoba. Its installed capacity stands, as of 2015, at 5,701 MW, mostly generated at 15 hydroelectricity generation stations on the Nelson, Saskatchewan, Laurie and the Winnipeg Rivers.\n\nThe company has completed the 200-MW Wuskwatim hydroelectric project in partnership with the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, with first power from the project in June 2012. By advancing the completion date of the project by 3 years, Manitoba Hydro hopes to cash in on lucrative exports in the Midwestern United States. The utility is currently building a new 695 MW station at Keeyask on the Nelson River, expecting completion in 2019.\n\nThe utility is also planning the construction of a third HVDC power line linking northern Manitoba and the Winnipeg area. The Bipole III project involves the construction of a 1,364 km power line and two new converter stations. With Keeyask under construction, Manitoba Hydro has also undertaken studies of one more large hydroelectric project, the Conawapa generation station.\n\nNew Brunswick has a diversified generation mix, featuring fossil fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear capacity. Established in 1920, the provincial utility, NB Power owned 3,297 MW of installed capacity as of March 31, 2008. Since then, the company retired 2 power plants and plans to permanently shut down the 300-MW oil-fired Dalhousie generating station.\n\nIn the last decade, the government-owned utility has faced problems with the failure of a plan to switch two of its large thermal facilities to Orimulsion, a heavy bitumen fuel produced by PDVSA, the Venezuelan government oil company, and a 2-year delay in the mid-life refit of the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station.\n\nIn October 2009, the provincial government signed a memorandum of understanding with Quebec to sell most of NB Power's assets to Hydro-Québec. The controversial deal was cancelled in March 2010.\n\nSince then, a couple of options are discussed to modernize New Brunswick electricity infrastructure, including a plan to build a 500-MW intertie with Nova Scotia and a preliminary agreement with France's Areva to evaluate the feasibility of a second nuclear generating station at the Point Lepreau site. However, the nuclear expansion plan was shelved within hours of the election of a Progressive Conservative government led by David Alward in September 2010.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador Hydro, a subsidiary of government-owned Nalcor Energy, has an installed generating capacity of 7289 MW and is the fourth largest of all utility companies in Canada. It owns and operates most generation in the province, the transmission grid and sells directly to large industrial customers. The company also serves remote communities not connected to the main power grids, on Newfoundland and in Labrador.\n\nNewfoundland Power, a subsidiary of St. John's-based Fortis Inc., is a regulated distributor serving 239,000 customers, making up 85% of all electricity consumers in the province. The company buys 90% of its energy from Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador mainly relies on hydropower for its generation needs, supplemented by the 500-MW Holyrood Thermal Generating Station, near St. John's. The province's main power station, the 5,428-MW Churchill Falls Generating Station, was commissioned between 1971 and 1974. The generating station is owned by the Churchill Falls Labrador Corporation Limited, a joint venture between Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (65.8%) and Hydro-Québec (34.2%). Most of the output of the plant is sold at a fixed price to the Quebec utility under a 65-year power purchase agreement due to expire in 2041.\n\nThe Lower Churchill Project is a planned hydroelectric project in Labrador, to develop the remaining 35 per cent of the Churchill River that has not already been developed by the Churchill Falls Generating Station. The Lower Churchill's two installations at Gull Island and Muskrat Falls will have a combined capacity of over 3,074 MW and have the ability to provide 16.7 TWh of electricity per year. The Muskrat Falls Generation Facility will consist of a dam, a spillway, and a powerhouse with four Kaplan turbines and a total generating capacity of 824 MW. Construction of the Muskrat Falls Generation Facility began in 2013 and is expected to be complete in 2019.\n\nNova Scotia Power Inc. (NSPI), a subsidiary of Halifax-based Emera, is the public utility in charge of the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Nova Scotia. Formerly a government-owned company, it was privatized in 1992 by the conservative government of premier Donald Cameron, in what was called at the time the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in Canadian history. From the $816 million proceeds, \"$616 million was used to recapitalize Nova Scotia Power by paying down debt owed by the utility\".\n\nNS Power has a generating capacity of 2,293 MW: 5 thermal plants fired with a mix of coal, petroleum coke, fuel oil and natural gas, provide the bulk of the 13 TWh yearly supply. The company also operates the Annapolis Royal Tidal Generating Station, the only one of its kind in North America and 33 hydroelectric generating stations, most of them small ones, with the exception of the 230 MW Wreck Cove Generating Station, inaugurated in 1978.\n\nOver the years, NS Power has been blamed by Nova Scotia residents for its poor maintenance record and its failure to quickly reconnect customers after storms. In September 2003, 700,000 Nova Scotia residents were without power for up to two weeks after the passage of Hurricane Juan. The Category 2 storm damaged 27 main transmission lines, several transmission towers, 117 distribution feeders, and 31 major electrical substations. More recently, the issue of the company's investment in the provincial grid has been raised at a leaders' debate during the 2009 election campaign. The company received praise from premier Darrell Dexter for its efforts in restoring power after the passage of Hurricane Earl in September 2010.\n\n\"For information on the small utility cooperative of Riverport and public utility electric distributors (of Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Antigonish, Berwick and Canso) see those towns' main articles. For information on their cooperative see Municipal Electric Utilities of Nova Scotia.\"\n\nElectricity is generated in Ontario from nuclear power, hydroelectric power, natural gas and renewables such as wind, solar and biomass. Total production in 2017 was 132.1 TWh (i.e. 132.1 billion kWh.) The various sources of generation used in 2017 are shown in the pie chart to the right. In April 2014, Ontario eliminated coal as a source of electricity generation. The generation mix for the current hour can be viewed at the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) webpage.\n\nAs noted above, total electricity production in Ontario 2017 was 132.1 TWh. Adding imports of 6.6 TWh and subtracting exports of 19.1 TWh leaves 119.6 TWh usage within Ontario. With an estimated 2017 population of 14,193,384, electricity usage per person in Ontario in 2017 was 9,307 kWh per year, or about 60% of the Canadian average shown in the table Electricity per person and by power source displayed earlier in this article. (Note that this number includes all use—commercial, industrial and institutional use as well as household use—and it is at the point of production, i.e. before subtracting transmission and distribution losses.) Usage per person in Ontario may be lower than the national average because natural gas is more widely available and has a significant cost advantage for heating.\n\nOntario has been considered a summer peaking grid since 2000, however due to particularly cold winter temperatures and moderate summer temperatures, Ontario was winter peaking in 2014. In its 18-Month Outlook issued September 2014, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) predicts a winter 2014–2015 peak of 22,149 MW under a normal weather scenario, and a summer 2015 peak of 22,808 MW, also under a normal weather scenario. The all-time record for Ontario demand was set on August 1, 2006, when peak demand for electricity reached 27,005 megawatts. (See 2006 North American heat wave.)\n\nOverall, Ontario is a net exporter of electricity. Ontario imports electricity, primarily from its neighbouring provinces of Quebec and Manitoba (both of which are primarily hydroelectric systems), and exports electricity, primarily to Michigan and New York State, which rely heavily on fossil fuels—coal in the case of Michigan, and natural gas in the case of New York.\n\nIn 2017, Ontario's gross exports were 19.1 TWh, i.e. roughly equal to half its hydro generation of 37.7 TWh in 2017. (Although Canada is the world's third-largest producer of natural gas, Ontario imports natural gas from the United States and from western Canada.) If all the carbon emissions associated with natural gas-fueled generation were allocated to the exports, almost all the electricity consumed within Ontario would be from non-carbon or carbon neutral sources. (Note however that the natural gas generation is not necessarily coincident with exports and natural gas plants sometimes need to be operated due to regional transmission constraints, and as backup for wind generation which is intermittent and somewhat unpredictable.)\n\nOntario embraced nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s, building 3 major nuclear facilities and 18 CANDU reactors, which in 2013 provided 59% of the province's electricity production, or kilowatt-hours equal to 65% of the electricity consumed within the province. The completion of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in 1993, \"at a cost several times the original estimates\", caused huge rate increases and a reassessment of Ontario's electricity policy. Three major policy documents, the Advisory Committee on Competition in Ontario's Electricity System (1996), chaired by former federal minister Donald Macdonald, a government White Paper on electricity policy (1997) and the Market Design Committee report (1999) paved the way for a major overhaul of the industry.\n\nIn April 1999, Ontario Hydro was split into five successor companies: Ontario Power Generation (OPG), in charge of generation; Hydro One, a transmission and distribution utility; the Independent Market Operator, responsible for the operation of a deregulated wholesale electric market in the province; the Electrical Safety Authority and the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation, in charge of the $38.1 billion stranded debt, derivatives and other liabilities of the former integrated public utility.\n\nIn 2001, OPG leased Canada's largest power plant, the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station to Bruce Power, a private consortium originally led by British Energy, reducing its share of the provincial generation market to 70%. The government opened the competitive market on May 1, 2002, but heat waves and droughts in the summer of 2002 caused wholesale prices to soar to peaks of $4.71/kWh in July and $10.28/kWh in September. Faced with bitter complaints from consumers, the Ernie Eves government announced a price freeze for small customers while leaving the wholesale market intact, on November 11, 2002.\n\nAlthough Eves was praised for the pause in generation market deregulation the cancellation of Hydro One's initial public offering and his handling of the 2003 North American blackout, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated by Dalton McGuinty's Liberals in the provincial election of 2003. In the meantime, the phasing out of coal-fired generation — including North America's largest coal plant, the 3,640-MW Nanticoke Generating Station — became a political issue. In 2002, the Conservatives promised to shut down Ontario's 5 coal plants by 2015, while McGuinty committed to a 2007 retirement date, which was pushed back to 2014.\n\nIn April 2009, the Ontario legislature passed the Green Energy Act establishing feed-in tariffs for power from renewable sources and streamlining the approval process for new generation sites. Two months after passing the bill, Ontario announced the suspension of a competitive process for the purchase of 2 new nuclear reactors at Darlington, citing the price tag, later evaluated at $26 billion. Critics of the government strategy stress the Act will increase the price of electricity and undermine the system's reliability, while pitting some local residents against wind developers.\n\nThe impact of the Act has been notable in terms of the price impact on end consumers. Since 2009, electricity prices have risen by 95% for homeowners and by 115% for small businesses in the province of Ontario.\n\nAs of June 2018, Ontario's wind capacity stood at 4,412 MW. As of 2010, Ontario's wind capacity represented more than a third of Canada's total.\n\nPrince Edward Island is the only Canadian province without a hydroelectric power station. The province is largely dependent on imported power from NB Power generation facilities in New Brunswick. Two submarine power lines provide more than 80% of the provincial load. Since the early 2000, the provincial government has promoted the province as a good place to set up wind farms.\n\nMaritime Electric, a subsidiary of St. John's-based Fortis Inc., operates the integrated public utility serving most of the province, with the exception of the city of Summerside, which has been providing electric service to its residents since 1920. Both utilities own and operate diesel plants, used as peakers or during emergencies.\n\nElectricity rates in Charlottetown are the highest of the 12 large Canadian cities surveyed by Hydro-Québec in its annual compendium of North American electricity rates. According to the document, a residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month would pay 17.29 cents/kWh, a rate two and a half times higher than the one paid by consumers in Montreal, Winnipeg or Vancouver.\n\nIn November 2009, Premier Robert Ghiz hoped to reduce the price of electricity while limiting atmospheric emissions by opening talks with the government of Quebec for a long term supply agreement. Negotiations, with Hydro-Québec, and other suppliers, including current supplier NB Power, are ongoing.\n\nThe Quebec electricity sector is dominated by Canada's largest utility, government-owned Hydro-Québec. With an installed capacity of 36,810 MW, including 34,118 MW of hydropower, the utility generated and bought 203.2 TWh in 2009, almost one-third of all electricity generated in Canada. Benefiting from low generation costs, favorable interest rates and high export prices, Hydro-Québec paid $10 billion in dividends to the Quebec government between 2005 and 2009.\n\nSince 2003, the company commissioned 8 new hydroelectric generating stations for a total of 2,343 MW and is currently building 6 new power plants: Eastmain-1-A (768 MW) and Sarcelle (150 MW) scheduled for 2012, and 4 generating stations on the Romaine River (1,550 MW) to be commissioned between 2014 and 2020. Hydro-Québec's latest strategic plan, released in 2009, outline a further 3,500 MW of new generation capacity, including 3,000 MW of additional hydro projects, to be built by 2035. The company's total investments in generation, transmission, distribution and energy efficiency for the 2009–2013 timeframe are expected to reach $25.1 billion.\n\nQuebec also intends to increase its wind generation capacity. The government's 2006 energy strategy calls for the construction of 3,500 MW by 2015. Two calls for tenders initiated in 2003 and 2005 resulted in the signing of 22 20-year Power Purchase Agreements between Hydro-Québec and independent power producers, for a total capacity of 2,990 MW. A third one, geared at small-scale community- or First Nations-led projects, is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. The province got 99% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2013.\n\nIn 2007, Saskatchewan produced 12,362 GWh of electricity through its coal-fired power plants, on a total generation of 20,278 GWh. SaskPower, the government-owned public utility is the main power generator in the province. The company has a generating capacity of 3,371 MW and 17 generating facilities. These include three coal-fired baseload facilities (1682 MW), five natural gas-fired plants (674 MW), seven hydroelectric developments (854 MW), and two wind farms (161 MW). Two independent power producers, the Cory and Meridian cogeneration stations have a combined capacity of 438 MW, while 5 waste heat facilities have a maximum output of 31 MW.\n\nThe current state of the electric system will require heavy investments in the next decade. Discussion have been undertaken with Manitoba about building a 138-kV interconnection between the two neighbouring provinces. A new privately owned natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation turbine in North Battleford is under construction. The 260-MW facility is expected to be completed in 2013.\n\nYukon Energy Corporation is the crown corporation that generates most of the power consumed in Yukon. Hydro is the main generation source, with a 93.2% share in 2007. It is supplemented by a wind turbine in Whitehorse and diesel generators in remote communities. Yukon has two separate grids. Neither are connected to the continental power grid. Yukon Electrical Company is the main distributor in Yukon.\n\nIn its \"Energy Strategy\", released in 2009, the Yukon government has stated it wants to increase the supply of renewable energy, hydro and wind, by 20%. The government is also considering linking Yukon's two main power grids by completing the Carmacks to Stewart transmission line. No timetable has been set.\n\nAlthough the Northwest Territories are not connected to the North American power grid, there are two electric networks operating in the territory, the first one in the Yellowknife area and the other in Fort Smith. In most communities, loads are served by local diesel generators.\nThe government-owned Northwest Territories Power Corporation is in charge of power generation, while Northland Utilities, a subsidiary of ATCO, operate the distribution networks.\n\nThe government-owned Qulliq Energy Corporation is the only power generator serving the remote communities of Nunavut. Qulliq, operating under the name Nunavut Power, has a total of 27 diesel-powered generators, serving 25 communities. The territory is not connected to the North American power grid.\n\nQulliq Energy plans to build a small hydroelectric project at Jaynes Inlet, not far from the territorial capital, Iqaluit, which is currently served by two diesel generators. The 5-MW generating station, which could cost upwards of $200 million, has been delayed by lower oil prices and the financial crisis. Construction could start in 2015 or 2016.\n\nin 2013, electricity generation was responsible for 105 Mt of carbon dioxide emissions, 20% of the nation's total, second only to transport at 32%. This represents an 18% reduction since 2005.\n\nWhile Canada reduces the carbon footprint in the US by exporting 10% of total hydroelectricity, more than half of all Canadian homes and businesses burn natural gas for heat. Hydro power, nuclear power and wind generate 80% of Canada's electricity, coal and natural gas are burned for the remaining 20%.\n\nAs of 2008, Alberta's electricity sector was the most carbon-intensive of all Canadian provinces and territories, with total emissions of 55.9 million tonnes of equivalent in 2008, accounting for 47% of all Canadian emissions in the electricity and heat generation sector. It is followed by Ontario (27.4 Mt eq.), Saskatchewan (15.4 Mt eq.) and Nova Scotia (9.4 Mt eq.). Of all provinces, Quebec has the lowest carbon intensity in the electricity sector with 2.45 g of eq. per kWh of electricity generated.\n\nOntario registered a large drop in emissions in 2008, due to lower demand, natural gas prices and government instructions to Ontario Power Generation regarding a gradual decommissioning of coal-fired generation by 2014. According to the Independent Electricity System Operator of Ontario, 4,700 MW of new natural gas-fired generation and 1,100 MW of wind farms have been commissioned in the province between 2003 and 2009. The new natural gas capacity will allow Ontario to retire 2 units each at the Nanticoke and Lambton generating stations by the end of 2010, on track for a complete phase-out by the end of 2014.\n\nIn Alberta, TransAlta and Capital Power Corporation undertook the construction of a carbon capture and storage project at the 450-MW Keephills-3 supercritical sub-bituminous coal-fired power station. The project, which received a $770 million grant from the federal and provincial governments, involved storing the captured through geological sequestration and enhanced oil recovery. It was scheduled to be operational by 2015; however, the project was canceled in 2012. In March 2010, SaskPower has announced its own carbon sequestration project at the Boundary Dam Power Station, the province's largest coal plant. In British Columbia, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to remove the 50-year-old gas-fired Burrard Generating Station from its roster of baseload plants.\n\nSome provincial hydro companies benefited a great deal from the liberalization of the United States electricity sector brought by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 888. New Brunswick, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec have been net exporters while BC Hydro has created an energy marketing subsidiary to actively trade on the neighbouring electricity market.\n\nIn 2009, Canada exported more than 53 TWh of electricity — approximately 9% of its output — to its southern neighbour the United States, while it imported 18 TWh. While occupying a relatively small part of the overall U.S. market, Canadian supplies constitute a significant share of the power consumed in key markets, such as New England, New York State, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn August 2010, Hydro-Québec signed a 26-year renewal of its 225-MW power contract with the largest Vermont public utilities, Central Vermont Public Service and Green Mountain Power. To facilitate the deal, a new renewable energy law, H.781, was signed into law by governor Jim Douglas on June 4, 2010, after passage in both houses of the Vermont Legislature. The Act makes Vermont the first U.S. state to declare large-scale hydroelectric power as \"a renewable energy resource\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2082995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082995", "title": "1823 papal conclave", "text": "1823 papal conclave\n\nThe papal conclave of 1823 was convoked following the death of Pope Pius VII on 20 August 1823. The conclave began on 2 September and ended 26 days later with the election of Cardinal Annibale Sermattei della Genga who became Pope Leo XII.\n\nPius VII, who had been elected in 1800, had reigned as Pope for what was considered a very long pontificate. During his reign as Pope, the Catholic Church had faced, in the French Revolution and its aftermath, a severe attack on its power and legitimacy. Pius himself had been a prisoner of Napoleon in France for six years.\n\nDuring Pius VII's papacy, the cardinals had tended to divide into two groups, the \"zelanti\" and the '. The \"zelanti\" were more radically reactionary than the ' and wanted a highly centralised Church and vehement opposition to the secularising reforms that had resulted in France. The \"\", though anti-liberal, were much more moderate and favoured a conciliatory approach to dealing with the problems that new ideologies and the incipient Industrial Revolution were creating. The leader of this faction was Pius VII's Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi, but the \"zelanti\" wanted a much less moderate pontiff and they set fervently to this task from the time of Pius VII's death.\n\nThe length of Pius VII's papacy had a significant influence because of the forty-nine electors who participated in the conclave, only Giulio Maria della Somaglia and Fabrizio Dionigio Ruffo were already cardinals when Pius VII was elected in 1800. Forty-seven of the forty-nine electors had had no experience electing a pope.\n\nA number of cardinals were thought at the beginning of the conclave to be possible successors to Pius VII. Antonio Gabriele Severoli was at first seen as the most likely \"papabile\", but the veto of Francis I, Emperor of Austria ruled him out when he looked to have a reasonable chance.\n\nFrancesco Saverio Castiglioni then emerged as the most likely candidate. The deceased pope Pius VII had in fact seemingly endorsed Castiglioni by having referred to the latter as Pius VIII, and indeed the candidate who was eventually elected predicted during the conclave that Castiglioni would someday reign under that name (as he did, succeeding the elected Leo in 1829). Castiglioni lost support in the 1823 conclave when the \"zelanti\" Cardinals came to realize that he was quite close to Consalvi.\n\nFollowing the decline of Castigioni's support in this conclave, the experienced Cardinal della Somaglia then had a turn as a possible candidate, but for some the mere fact that he had signed his letters \"Citizen Somaglia\" during the occupation of the Papal States by Napoleon I of France ruled him out.\n\nIt was only then that the eventual winner, Vicar of Rome Annibale della Genga, who was being promoted by the \"zelanti\", began to gather support.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 7, 1999. In the episode, a school presentation on sexual harassment prevention leads to Cartman suing Stan for sexual harassment, which in turn kicks off a series of sexual harassment lawsuits across South Park.\n\nThis was the first episode to air after the release of the theatrical film \"\". According to the DVD commentary of the episode, Parker and Stone were so exhausted and hungover from doing the \"South Park\" film, that they have no memory of making this episode.\n\nMr. Garrison's class is visited by an educational mascot, \"Petey the Sexual Harassment Panda\", who attempts to teach the kids about sexual harassment so as to prevent it in school. During the visit, Stan calls Cartman an \"ass-sucker\", and Cartman, \"inspired\" by the panda's teaching, sues Stan for sexual harassment claiming that he's sexually harassed him for the last time; Kyle's father, Gerald Broflovski, acts as his lawyer, and Cartman wins half of Stan's possessions. Gerald then decides to encourage Cartman (and later, others) not only to sue each other but also the teachers and the school, leading to chaos throughout the town as he gets rich. Kyle's dad quickly becomes the target of many people's wrath, while he continues to renovate his family's house into a mansion with his newly gained assets. Soon afterwards the whole town is suing each other and Gerald is taking advantage of this by being a lawyer for them all, getting more and more money from every case. Because everyone is scared of being sued, no one can stand up to Gerald.\n\nBecause the school board needs to cut costs, Sexual Harassment Panda is fired. He cannot get a new job as a panda mascot, and refuses to change his costume due to an apparently genuine belief that he's a panda. Thus, he goes to the Island of Misfit Mascots Commune, for mascots whose messages simply make no sense (one mascot kills Kenny by accident). Many mascots there also seem to believe they are the animals they portray. The boys, however, seeing the negative results of the lawsuits on their school, track Sexual Harassment Panda down and convince him to return to town with a new message. Meanwhile, Gerald is litigating the biggest sexual harassment lawsuit ever, \"Everyone v. Everyone,\" where he represents \"everyone\" who hires him to take on everyone else (flagrantly disregarding conflict of interest in the process).\n\nThe panda arrives back in South Park under a new name, \"Petey the Don't Sue People Panda\", and delivers a sermon on how people should not sue each other constantly because it does nothing but damage the school system, taking away money from classrooms, schools and themselves, the taxpayers. The people, realizing the sagacity of this statement, angrily cry that they should sue Gerald, who quickly agrees to file no more lawsuits about sexual harassment in schools or anywhere else. In the end, all the sexual harassment suits are dropped and Kyle's dad presumably gets away with millions of dollars.\n\nThis episode satirizes the widely publicized lawsuits over sexual harassment in schools that occurred in the late 1990s, as well as ambulance-chasing lawyers. The \"Island of Misfit Mascots Commune\" is a parody of \"The Island of Misfit Toys\" from \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Sexual Harassment Panda is a parody of Ike the Coast Guard Panda, a mascot for the United States Coast Guard who encourages kids to wear life vests. Parker and Stone indicated in the DVD commentary that the panda is Santa Claus from \"Jesus vs. Frosty\", as they have the same voice.\n\n"}

{"id": "2083029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083029", "title": "D-Bus", "text": "D-Bus\n\nIn computing, D-Bus (short for \"Desktop Bus\")\nis a software bus, inter-process communication (IPC), and remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that allows communication between multiple processes running concurrently on the same machine. D-Bus was developed as part of the freedesktop.org project, initiated by Havoc Pennington from Red Hat to standardize services provided by Linux desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE.\n\nThe freedesktop.org project also developed a free and open-source software library called libdbus, as a reference implementation of the specification. This library should not be confused with D-Bus itself, as other implementations of the D-Bus specification also exist, such as GDBus (GNOME), QtDBus (Qt/KDE), dbus-java and sd-bus (part of systemd).\n\nD-Bus is an IPC mechanism initially designed to replace the software component communications systems used by the GNOME and KDE Linux desktop environments (CORBA and DCOP respectively). The components of these desktop environments are normally distributed in many processes, each one providing only a few —usually one— \"services\". These services may be used by regular client applications or by other components of the desktop environment to perform their tasks.\n\nDue to the large number of processes involved —adding up processes providing the services and clients accessing them— establishing one-to-one IPC communications between all of them becomes an inefficient and quite unreliable approach. Instead, D-Bus provides a software-bus abstraction that gathers all the communications between a group of processes over a single shared virtual channel. Processes connected to a bus don't know how it is internally implemented, but D-Bus specification guarantees that all processes connected to the bus can communicate with each other through it.\n\nLinux desktop environments take advantage of the D-Bus facilities by instantiating not one bus but many:\n\nA process can connect to any number of buses, provided that it has been granted access to them. In practice, this means that any user process can connect to the system bus and to its current session bus, but not to another user's session buses, or even to a different session bus owned by the same user. The latter restriction may change in the future if all user sessions are combined into a single user bus.\n\nD-Bus provides additional or simplifies existing functionality to the applications, including information-sharing, modularity and privilege separation. For example, information on an incoming voice-call received through Bluetooth or Skype can be propagated and interpreted by any currently-running music player, which can react by muting the volume or by pausing playback until the call is finished.\n\nD-Bus can also be used as a framework to integrate different components of a user application. For instance, an office suite can communicate through the session bus to share data between a word processor and a spreadsheet.\n\nEvery connection to a bus is identified in the context of D-Bus by what is called a \"bus name\". A bus name consists of two or more dot-separated strings of letters, digits, dashes, and underscores. An example of a valid bus name is .\n\nWhen a process sets up a connection to a bus, the bus assigns to the connection a special bus name called \"unique connection name\". Bus names of this type are immutable—it's guaranteed they won't change as long as the connection exists—and, more importantly, they can't be reused during the bus lifetime. This means that no other connection to that bus will ever have assigned such unique connection name, even if the same process closes down the connection to the bus and creates a new one. Unique connection names are easily recognizable because they start with the—otherwise forbidden—colon character. An example of a unique connection name is (the characters after the colon have no particular meaning).\n\nA process can ask for additional bus names for its connection, provided that any requested name is not already being used by another connection to the bus. In D-Bus parlance, when a bus name is assigned to a connection, it is said the connection \"owns\" the bus name. In that sense, a bus name can't be owned by two connections at the same time, but, unlike unique connection names, these names can be reused if they are available: a process may reclaim a bus name released —purposely or not— by another process.\n\nThe idea behind these additional bus names, commonly called \"well-known names\", is to provide a way to refer to a service using a prearranged bus name. For instance, the service that reports the current time and date in the system bus lies in the process whose connection owns the bus name, regardless of which process it is.\n\nBus names can be used as a simple way to implement single instance applications (second instances detect that the bus name is already taken). It can also be used to track a service process lifecycle, since the bus sends a notification when a bus name is released due to a process termination.\n\nBecause of its original conception as a replacement for several component oriented communications systems, D-Bus shares with its predecessors an object model in which to express the semantics of the communications between clients and services. The terms used in the D-Bus object model mimic those used by some object oriented programming languages. That doesn't mean that D-Bus is somehow limited to OOP languages —in fact, the most used implementation () is written in C, a procedural programming language.\nIn D-Bus, a process offers its services by exposing \"objects\". These objects have \"methods\" that can be invoked, and \"signals\" that the object can emit. Methods and signals are collectively referred to as the \"members\" of the object. Any client connected to the bus can interact with an object by using its methods, making requests or commanding the object to perform actions. For instance, an object representing a time service can be queried by a client using a method that returns the current date and time. A client can also listen to signals that an object emits when its state changes due to certain events, usually related to the underlying service. An example would be when a service that manages hardware devices —such as USB or network drivers— signals a \"new hardware device added\" event. Clients should instruct the bus that they are interested in receiving certain signals from a particular object, since a D-Bus bus only passes signals to those processes with a registered interest in them.\n\nA process connected to a D-Bus bus can request it to \"export\" as many D-Bus objects as it wants. Each object is identified by an \"object path\", a string of numbers, letters and underscores separated and prefixed by the slash character, called that because of their resemblance to Unix filesystem paths. The object path is selected by the requesting process, and must be unique in the context of that bus connection. An example of a valid object path is . However, it's not enforced —but also not discouraged— to form hierarchies within object paths. The particular naming convention for the objects of a service is entirely up to the developers of such service, but many developers choose to namespace them using the reserved domain name of the project as a prefix (e.g. ).\n\nEvery object is inextricably associated to the particular bus connection where it was exported, and, from the D-Bus point of view, only lives in the context of such connection. Therefore, in order to be able to use a certain service, a client must indicate not only the object path providing the desired service, but also the bus name under which the service process is connected to the bus. This in turn allows that several processes connected to the bus can export different objects with identical object paths unambiguously.\n\nMembers —methods and signals— that can be used with an object are specified by an \"interface\". An \"interface\" is a set of declarations of methods (including its passing and returning parameters) and signals (including its parameters) identified by a dot-separated name resembling the Java language interfaces notation. An example of a valid interface name is . Despite their similarity, interface names and bus names should not be mistaken. A D-Bus object can \"implement\" several interfaces, but at least must implement one, providing support for every method and signal defined by it. The combination of all interfaces implemented by an object is called the object \"type\".\n\nWhen using an object, it's a good practice for the client process to provide the member's interface name besides the member's name, but is only mandatory when there is an ambiguity caused by duplicated member names available from different interfaces implemented by the object —otherwise, the selected member is undefined or erroneous. An emitted signal, on the other hand, must always indicate to which interface it belongs.\n\nThe D-Bus specification also defines several standard interfaces that objects may want to implement in addition to its own interfaces. Although technically optional, most D-Bus service developers choose to support them in their exported objects since they offer important additional features to D-Bus clients, such as introspection. These standard interfaces are:\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines a number of administrative bus operations (called \"bus services\") to be performed using the object that resides in the bus name. Each bus reserves this special bus name for itself, and manages any requests made specifically to this combination of bus name and object path. The administrative operations provided by the bus are those defined by the object's interface . These operations are used for example to provide information about the status of the bus, or to manage the request and release of additional \"well-known\" bus names.\n\nD-Bus was conceived as a generic, high-level inter-process communication system. To accomplish such goals, D-Bus communications are based on the exchange of \"messages\" between processes instead of \"raw bytes\". D-Bus messages are high-level discrete items that a process can send through the bus to another connected process. Messages have a well-defined structure (even the types of the data carried in their payload are defined), allowing the bus to validate them and to reject any ill-formed message.\nIn this regard, D-Bus is closer to an RPC mechanism than to a classic IPC mechanism, with its own type definition system and its own marshaling.\nThe bus supports two modes of interchanging messages between a client and a service process:\n\nEvery D-Bus message consists of a header and a body. The header is formed by several fields that identify the type of message, the sender, as well as information required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or signal name, interface name, etc.). The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets —for instance the input or output arguments. All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the \"wire format\" which supports the serialization of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on, also referred to as marshaling.\n\nThe D-Bus specification defines the wire protocol: how to build the D-Bus messages to be exchanged between processes within a D-Bus connection. However, it does not define the underlying transport method for delivering these messages.\n\nMost existing D-Bus implementations follow the architecture of the reference implementation. This architecture consists of two main components:\n\nThe library (or its equivalent) internally uses a native lower-level IPC mechanism to transport the required D-Bus messages between the two processes in both ends of the D-Bus connection. D-Bus specification doesn't mandate which particular IPC transport mechanisms should be available to use, as it's the communications library that decides what transport methods it supports. For instance, in Linux and Unix-like operating systems typically uses Unix domain sockets as the underlying transport method, but it also supports TCP sockets.\n\nThe communications libraries of both processes must agree on the selected transport method and also on the particular channel used for their communication. This information is defined by what D-Bus calls an \"address\". Unix-domain socket are filesystem objects, and therefore they can be identified by a filename, so a valid address would be codice_1. Both processes must pass the same address to their respective communications libraries to establish the D-Bus connection between them. An address can also provide additional data to the communications library in the form of comma-separated codice_2 pairs. This way, for example, it can provide authentication information to a specific type of connection that supports it.\n\nWhen a message bus daemon like is used to implement a D-Bus bus, all processes that want to connect to the bus must know the \"bus address\", the address by which a process can establish a D-Bus connection to the central message bus process. In this scenario, the message bus daemon selects the bus address and the remainder processes must pass that value to their corresponding or equivalent libraries. defines a different bus address for every bus instance it provides. These addresses are defined in the daemon's configuration files.\n\nTwo processes can use a D-Bus connection to exchange messages directly between them, but this is not the way in which D-Bus is normally intended to be used. The usual way is to always use a message bus daemon (i.e. ) as a communications central point to which each process should establish its point-to-point D-Bus connection. When a process —client or service— sends a D-Bus message, the message bus process receives it in the first instance and delivers it to the appropriate recipient. The message bus daemon may be seen as a hub or router in charge of getting each message to its destination by repeating it through the D-Bus connection to the recipient process. The recipient process is determined by the destination bus name in the message's header field, or by the subscription information to signals maintained by the message bus daemon in the case of signal propagation messages. The message bus daemon can also produce its own messages as a response to certain conditions, such as an error message to a process that sent a message to a nonexistent bus name.\n\nD-Bus was started in 2002 by Havoc Pennington, Alex Larsson (Red Hat) and Anders Carlsson. The version 1.0 —considered API stable— was released in November 2006.\nHeavily influenced by the DCOP system used by versions 2 and 3 of KDE, D-Bus has replaced DCOP in the KDE 4 release. An implementation of D-Bus supports most POSIX operating systems, and a port for Windows exists. It is used by Qt 4 and GNOME. In GNOME it has gradually replaced most parts of the earlier Bonobo mechanism. It is also used by Xfce.\n\nOne of the earlier adopters was the (nowadays deprecated) Hardware Abstraction Layer. HAL used D-Bus to export information about hardware that has been added to or removed from the computer.\n\nThe usage of D-Bus is steadily expanding beyond the initial scope of desktop environments to cover an increasing amount of system services. For instance, NetworkManager network daemon, BlueZ bluetooth stack and Pulseaudio sound server use D-Bus to provide part or all of its services. systemd uses the D-Bus wire protocol for communication between and systemd, and is also promoting traditional system daemons to D-Bus services, such as logind. Another heavy user of D-Bus is Polkit, whose policy authority daemon is implemented as a service connected to the system bus.\n\nIt is also used as the Wire protocol for the AllJoyn protocol for home automation, to this end AllJoyn adds discovery, session management, security, header compression, embedded device support and makes it transport agnostic.\n\nAlthough there are several implementations of D-Bus, the most widely used is the reference implementation \"libdbus\", developed by the same freedesktop.org project that designed the specification. However, libdbus is a low-level implementation that was never meant to be used directly by application developers, but as a reference guide for other reimplementations of D-Bus (such as those included in standard libraries of desktop environments, or in programming language bindings). The freedesktop.org project itself recommends applications authors to \"use one of the higher level bindings or implementations\" instead. The predominance of libdbus as the most used D-Bus implementation caused the terms \"D-Bus\" and \"libdbus\" to be often used interchangeably, leading to confusion.\n\nGDBus is an implementation of D-Bus based on GIO streams included in GLib, aiming to be used by GTK+ and GNOME. GDBus is not a wrapper of libdbus, but a complete and independent reimplementation of the D-Bus specification and protocol. MATE Desktop and Xfce (version 4.14), which are also based on GTK+ 3, also use GDBus.\n\nQtDBus is an implementation of D-Bus included in the Qt library since its version 4.2. This component is used by KDE applications, libraries and components to access the D-Bus services available in a system.\n\nIn 2013, the systemd project rewrote libdbus in an effort to simplify the code, but it also resulted in a significant increase of the overall D-Bus performance. In preliminary benchmarks, BMW found that the systemd's D-Bus library increased performance by 360%. By version 221 of systemd, the sd-bus API was declared stable.\n\nThe libnih project provides a light-weight \"standard library\" of C support for D-Bus. Additionally, it has good support for cross compiling.\n\n \"kdbus\" was a project that aimed to reimplement D-Bus as a kernel-mediated peer-to-peer inter-process communication mechanism. Beside performance improvements, kdbus would have advantages arising from other Linux kernel features such as namespaces and auditing, security from the kernel mediating, closing race conditions, and allowing D-Bus to be used during boot and shutdown (as needed by systemd). kdbus inclusion in the Linux kernel proved controversial, and was dropped in favor of BUS1, as a more generic inter-process communication.\n\nSeveral programming language bindings for D-Bus have been developed, such as those for Java, C# and Ruby.\n\n"}

It was a Saturday on the 38th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, and according to an account by a reporter for the \"Washington Union\", twenty thousand people attended in and around the park. Senator Stephen A. Douglas was the keynote speaker at the unveiling. There are three other castings in New Orleans, Jacksonville, Florida, and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBeginning in 1860, the \"Statue of Freedom\", which sits atop the United States Capitol, was cast in five main sections by Mills, whose bronze foundry was located on the outskirts of Washington.\n\nMills also captured a tense and crucial moment in the American Revolutionary War with the creation of an equestrian statue of Lt. Gen. George Washington in 1860. Congress commissioned this work in 1853 because of the tremendous popularity of Mills' equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson. The elaborate high pedestal that Mills originally designed, with three tiers of sculptured relief panels and smaller equestrian statues of Washington's generals, were never executed because of a lack of adequate funds.\n\n"}

In antiquity the title was also written \"Naupaktika\" (Latin \"Naupactica\"), and it is also in the present day sometimes referred to among scholars by the Latin phrase \"carmen Naupactium\" (\"Naupactian poem\"). Naupactus is a city in Greece on the Corinthian Gulf.\n\nThe \"Naupactia\" was probably composed in the 6th or 5th century BCE. Its authorship is uncertain: most ancient writers simply refer to \"the author of the \"Naupactia\"\". The 2nd-century CE travelogue writer Pausanias records that most people in his time considered that it was by an anonymous Milesian poet, but he himself judges that it was most likely by Carcinus of Naupactus; Pausanias' reasoning is open to doubt.\n\nIt is not known how long the poem was. In current critical editions, only ten lines of the poem's text survive. Pausanias records that the poem was \"written about women\"; fewer than a dozen other fragmentary references give indications as to the content, but they tend to suggest that the content was largely genealogical. These two facts combined suggest similarities with the pseudo-Hesiodic poem the \"Catalogue of Women\". More than half of the surviving fragments are devoted to the heroic story of the Argonauts: it is likely that this occupied a large proportion of the poem, and probably influenced later poetic accounts of the story such as Pindar's fourth \"Pythian\" ode, and the best-known version, Apollonius' \"Argonautica\".\n\n"}

This battle was won by the Métis in Red River. Since this battle the Métis flags have been important in Métis culture.\n\nThe flag is used in traditional Métis territories in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and extended into Northern Ontario. The blue background flag has been accepted by the Métis National Council as the official flag of the Métis Nation. The red flag now stands as the provincial ensign for the Métis Nation of Alberta.\n\nThe flag shows a white infinity symbol on a field of either blue or red. The infinity symbol has two meanings: it represents the faith that the Métis culture shall live on forever, and the mixing of the European immigrants (primarily French) and the First Nations peoples. As such, it can also be perceived as two conjoined circles, standing for the unity of two cultures. It was a symbol bringing people together. The flag was a gift from the North West Company, which was responsible for the design of the flag.\n\nThe Métis flag first came into existence in 1816. The flag first appeared at the beginning of the Battle of Seven Oaks. Throughout history in present-day Manitoba there were several flags that have existed. The two red flags represent the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company. There was a great amount of competition between the two companies.

{"id": "2083090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083090", "title": "Washington Circle", "text": "Washington Circle\n\nWashington Circle is a traffic circle in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., United States. It is located on the border of the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods, which is a part of the Ward 2 section in Washington. It is the intersection of 23rd Street, K Street, New Hampshire Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. The through lanes of K Street (which are U.S. Route 29) travel underneath the circle in a tunnel, while the service lanes intersect the circle.\n\nWashington Circle was first drawn on Pierre L’Enfant’s map in 1791 (Washington Circle, as well as the majority of the map, is unlabeled in L’Enfant’s original plan). Looking at L’Enfant’s Map, one can see that streets were laid in form of grids and there were many intersections around the circle. In addition to the street grids, there are a couple of other circles beside the circle. These features indicate the strategic positioning of the circle within the city. The circle intersects four major roads. On the northeastern side of the circle there’s a vista along New Hampshire Avenue that leads to DuPont Circle while on the southeastern side, there is another pleasant vista from Pennsylvania avenue that leads to the White house. The circle also intersects 23rd and K streets.\n\nIn 1850, Washington Circle and its surroundings were gradually developing. Looking at the 1850 map of Washington Circle, one can see that both New Hampshire Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue were more pronounced on the map than they were in L’Enfant’s map. This shows that the two avenues were well paved in 1850. Although the avenues were developing, 23RD and K Streets were yet to be properly developed. Also the Washington Circle, itself, was very bland during this period, it had not been beautified and was known as a dangerous part of the city. The 1851 map shows that K Street, known as the area’s broadest thoroughfare also became paved. The map also illustrates the development of the circle’s surrounding with over thirty-three buildings between the New Hampshire and Pennsylvania intersection. Carefully observing the 1852 map, one can infer that not much had changed from the previous year’s map. The growth of Washington Circle was indeed a very slow one and this may be, because of the unwillingness of the congress to back up the development of the city.\n\nThe American Civil War was fought from 1861 to 1865 and Washington Circle was an instrumental location for the Union Army during the war.\nIn 1862, streetcars tracks were laid around Washington Circle, but were not properly maintained during the turbulent years of the Civil War. Track improvements were made during the 1870s and the park was redesigned in 1885. These tracks were used to transport war weapons and machineries for war efforts. Also the south of the circle along 23rd street was used as a Union army encampment, named Camp Fry. Camp Fry served as a camp for wounded soldiers to recuperate. After the civil war, the camp was dismantled. St. Paul’s Episcopal church, popularly known as Old St. Paul’s Church was built in 1866 and was the first church built around the circle at the corner of 23rd street. With the influx of the African American population after the civil war, the church was built to act as a form of missionary to the people. St. Ann’s Infant Asylum was also present during the 1860s and it occupied the building that the British Legation once occupied.\n\nIn the 1892 map of Washington Circle, one can see the detailed structure of buildings present then. The majority of the buildings present during this period were built with stone. Between New Hampshire Avenue and K Street, most of the buildings were built with brick. There were very few green houses and most buildings served as stables or sheds. The neighborhood around Washington Circle changed during the 20th century with the relocation of the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom campus. Foggy Bottom (including the area surrounding Washington Circle) was meant to be a residential area. With the new presence of the George Washington University which was brought on during the twentieth century, the area became much more institutionalized as seen through the George Washington University Hospital, located on the southeast end of the park.\n\nThe Foggy Bottom campus of The George Washington University (GWU) adjoins Washington Circle. GWU's Square 54 complex is located directly south of the circle, near The George Washington University Hospital. The closest Washington Metro station is Foggy Bottom–GWU.\n\nA bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Clark Mills and depicting George Washington riding his horse during the Battle of Princeton, was installed in the center of the circle on February 22, 1860. The Continental Congress voted to build the statue in George Washington’s honor in 1783 but the statue was not commissioned until 1853 at a total cost of $60,000. Mills depicted General Washington in the heroic, idealized Romantic style, reminiscent of Jacques-Louis David's painting \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps\". Washington's horse was modeled on a wild horse that was captured on the plains of Kansas. The National Park Service now maintains Washington Circle's park, the public space surrounding Washington's statue.\n\n"}

In addition to the original Latin, Szyk translated the text of the Statute into Polish, Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, German, English, and Spanish. In 1929, Szyk's Statute miniatures were exhibited throughout Poland, namely in Lodz, Warsaw, Kraków, and Kalisz.

These three reflected lines concur at the isogonal conjugate of \"P\". (This definition applies only to points not on a sideline of triangle \"ABC\".) This is a direct result of the trigonometric form of Ceva's theorem.\n\nThe isogonal conjugate of a point \"P\" is sometimes denoted by \"P*\". The isogonal conjugate of \"P*\" is \"P\".\n\nThe isogonal conjugate of the incentre \"I\" is itself. The isogonal conjugate of the orthocentre \"H\" is the circumcentre \"O\". The isogonal conjugate of the centroid \"G\" is (by definition) the symmedian point \"K\". The isogonal conjugates of the Fermat points are the isodynamic points and vice versa. The Brocard points are isogonal conjugates of each other.\n\nIn trilinear coordinates, if \"X\" = \"x\" : \"y\" : \"z\" is a point not on a sideline of triangle \"ABC\", then its isogonal conjugate is 1/\"x\" : 1/\"y\" : 1/\"z\". For this reason, the isogonal conjugate of \"X\" is sometimes denoted by \"X\". The set \"S\" of triangle centers under trilinear product, defined by\n\nis a commutative group, and the inverse of each \"X\" in \"S\" is \"X\".\n\nAs isogonal conjugation is a function, it makes sense to speak of the isogonal conjugate of sets of points, such as lines and circles. For example, the isogonal conjugate of a line is a circumconic; specifically, an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola according as the line intersects the circumcircle in 0, 1, or 2 points. The isogonal conjugate of the circumcircle is the line at infinity.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\"Prionotus carolinus\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight.\n\nThey are bottom-dwelling fish, living down to , although they can be found in much shallower water. Most species are around in length. They have an unusually solid skull, and many species also possess armored plates on their bodies. Another distinctive feature is the presence of a \"drumming muscle\" that makes sounds by beating against the swim bladder. When caught, they make a croaking noise similar to a frog, which has given them the onomatopoeic name gurnard.\n\nSea robins have six spiny \"legs\", three on each side. These legs are actually flexible spines that were once part of the pectoral fin. During development, the spines separate from the rest of the fin, developing into feeler-like \"forelegs\". The pectoral fins can be used to walk on the sea floor as well as to explore the bottom in search of food. The first three rays of the pectoral fins are membrane-free and used for chemoreception being highly sensitive to amino acids prevalent in marine invertebrates.\n\nGurnard have firm white flesh that holds together well in cooking, making them well-suited to soups and stews. They were often caught in British waters as a bycatch and discarded. However, as other species became less sustainable and more expensive, , gurnards were becoming more popular in Britain, and the wholesale price between 2007 and 2008 was reported to have increased from £0.25 per kg to £4. Sea robins also are now appearing in fish markets in the U.S. One source says that gurnards are rather bony and lacking in flavour, and usually sold quite cheaply; others praise its flavour and texture.\n\nThe flesh of this fish is commonly used in the French dish \"bouillabaisse\".\n\nSea robins can be caught by dropping a variety of baits and lures to the seafloor, where they actively feed. Mackerel is believed to be the most efficient bait for catching sea robins, but crabs, bunker and other fish meat can also be used successfully depending on location. Sea robins can also be caught by lure fishing if lured near the substrate. They are often considered to be rough fish, caught when fishing for more desirable fish such as striped bass or flounder.

The third movement incorporates a funeral march, clearly anticipating the watershed of the Eroica Symphony that Beethoven wrote in 1803–1804. This is the only movement from his sonatas that Beethoven arranged for orchestra, and was played during Beethoven's own funeral procession in 1827.\n\nThis sonata is also unusual in that none of its four movements is in sonata-allegro form.\n\nIn most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, the third movement is in and in ternary form, while the second movement is slow and in a different key from the other movements. In this sonata, the second and third movements have switched roles, where the second movement is the ternary scherzo and trio, while the third movement is the slow movement in the tonic minor.\n\nThe movement consists of a theme by Beethoven and five variations. The third variation has been called a \"pre-echo\" of the funeral march movement by Andras Schiff during his lecture on the sonata. This movement is also unusual in the sense that it is not in sonata form but rather a set of variations on a theme.\n\nIn some editions there are no tempo markings, just \"Marcia Funebre, sulla morte d'un Eroe\"(\"Funeral March, regarding to the death of a hero\")\n\nThe main theme of Schubert's Impromptu in A major, Op. 142 No. 2 is strikingly similar to the theme in the first movement of Beethoven's sonata. The four-bar phrases that open these pieces are almost identical in most musical aspects: key, harmony, voicing, register, and basic as well as harmonic rhythm. Another less immediate connection exists with the main theme, also in A major, of the \"Adagio\" movement in Schubert's piano sonata in C minor, D. 958. Indeed, Schubert may have borrowed these themes from Beethoven, as he often did in his compositions.\n\nThis sonata was greatly admired by Chopin, who repeated its basic sequence of scherzo, funeral march with trio, and perpetuum mobile finale in his own Piano Sonata in B minor. His first movement, however, is also animated and in sonata form, unlike Beethoven's \"Andante con variazioni\".\n\n\n"}

Helen Wells (1910-1986) wrote volumes #1-7 and 17-27, and Julie Campbell Tatham (1908-1999), the creator of Trixie Belden, wrote volumes #8-16. Wells also created the Vicki Barr series. During World War II, the series encouraged girls to become nurses as a way to aid the war effort. \"Cherry Ames\" original editions are prized by collectors and fans. The series generated a few spin-off items, including a Parker Brothers board game; some titles have been reprinted.\n\nThe series stars a job-hopping, mystery-solving nurse in the Nancy Drew mold, named Cherry Ames. Cherry (short for Charity) hails from Hilton, Illinois (based on Wells' hometown of Danville, Illinois), and was steered into nursing by Dr. Joseph Fortune, an old family friend. Cherry's training at the Spencer Hospital School of Nursing is chronicled in the first two books. There, she meets the classmates who become lifelong friends.\n\nWith the third book in the series \"Army Nurse\", Cherry joins the Army Nurse Corps, and, after the war, she moves to Greenwich Village. Whenever Cherry isn't working with the Visiting Nurse Service, Dr. Joe sends her on assignments in various parts of the country. Unlike other nurses of girls' fiction, such as Sue Barton, Cherry remains unpartnered throughout her career, although an occasional beau will crop up, such as Dr. \"Lex\" Upham.\n\nCherry's early adventures are set during World War II. In these early adventures, Cherry solves problems and captures criminals when men in authority have failed to do so, \"demonstrating that women can succeed in the public, working world.\"\n\nThe books were written by Helen Wells and Julie Tatham and published in the United States by Grosset & Dunlap between 1943 and 1968. They were extensively printed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s and 1960s. Beginning in 2005, the Cherry Ames series was licensed to the Springer Publishing Company and are currently being re-printed. In addition, a new edition of \"Cherry Ames, Student Nurse\" was released by the Palm Healthcare Foundation, Inc., through its Palm Publishing LLC subsidiary. Proceeds from the sale of the books were used to support nursing scholarships.\n\n1. \"Cherry Ames, Student Nurse\" (1943)\n2. \"Cherry Ames, Senior Nurse\" (1944)\n3. \"Cherry Ames, Army Nurse\" (1944)\n4. \"Cherry Ames, Chief Nurse\" (1944)\n5. \"Cherry Ames, Flight Nurse\" (1945)\n6. \"Cherry Ames, Veterans' Nurse\" (1946)\n7. \"Cherry Ames, Private Duty Nurse\" (1946)\n8. \"Cherry Ames, Visiting Nurse\" (1947)\n9. \"Cherry Ames, Cruise Nurse\" (1948)\n10. \"Cherry Ames, At Spencer\" (1949)\n11. \"Cherry Ames, Night Supervisor\" (1950)\n12. \"Cherry Ames, Mountaineer Nurse\" (1951)\n13. \"Cherry Ames, Clinic Nurse\" (1952)\n14. \"Cherry Ames, Dude Ranch Nurse\" (1953)\n\n15. \"Cherry Ames, Rest Home Nurse\" (1954)\n16. \"Cherry Ames, Country Doctor's Nurse\" (1955)\n17. \"Cherry Ames, Boarding School Nurse\" (1955) \n18. \"Cherry Ames, Department Store Nurse\" (1956)\n19. \"Cherry Ames, Camp Nurse\" (1957)\n20. \"Cherry Ames, At Hilton Hospital\" (1959)\n21. \"Cherry Ames, Island Nurse\" (1960)\n22. \"Cherry Ames, Rural Nurse\" (1961)\n23. \"Cherry Ames, Staff Nurse\" (1962)\n24. \"Cherry Ames, Companion Nurse\" (1964) \n25. \"Cherry Ames, Jungle Nurse\" (1965)\n26. \"Cherry Ames: The Mystery in the Doctor's Office\" (1966)\n27. \"Cherry Ames: Ski Nurse Mystery\" (1968)\nBetween 1957 and 1964, the \"Cherry Ames Girls Annual\" was printed and distributed in the UK, usually before Christmas. Each annual had two original Cherry Ames short stories by Helen Wells, and additional stories by other authors.\n\nIn 1959, \"Cherry Ames' Book of First Aid and Home Nursing\" was published by Helen Wells for adolescents as a companion volume to the series.\n\nAlso in 1959, \"Cherry Ames' Nursing Game\" was published by American board game titan, Parker Brothers Inc.. Designed for 2 to 6 players, the game consists of a center-seamed, illustrated game board depicting various rooms in a hospital, 6 colored tokens, 36 colored rings, 20 directional cards, and a spinner. The object of the game is to travel about the board, gather six rings, and then leave the board at the space marked 'graduate.'\n\nIn the 1990s, Mabel Maney created a series of little known gay parodies of the girl-sleuth series books, bringing out their imagined lesbian subtext. Her first book, \"The Case of the Not-So-Nice Nurse\", had lesbian detectives “Cherry Aimless” and “Nancy Clue” doing more than just detective work with each other.\n\n\n"}

It is separated from the island of Newfoundland by Baccalieu Tickle, a small strait and an abundant fishing ground. The island has some trees but mostly rocky.\n\nThe name \"Baccalieu\" is derived either from the Portuguese \"bacalhau\", Spanish \"bacalao\" or the Basque \"baccalos\", all meaning \"codfish\". Early Portuguese maps dating before Columbus' voyage indicate an island west of the Azores named Terra do Bacalhau which may have been the whole island of Newfoundland. Modern Baccalieu Island was known to Europeans by that name since at least 1556, when it was drawn on the Gastaldi map as \"Bacalaos\".\n\nBaccalieu Island is the largest seabird island in Newfoundland and supports the greatest diversity of breeding seabirds in eastern North America. The island supports the largest known colony of Leach's storm-petrel in the world, approximately 40% of the global population and about 70% of the western Atlantic population of this species. It is a nesting area for 11 breeding species:\n\n\nThe island has a surface of 5 km, and the reserve spans 23 km, including all of the island and one kilometre of ocean around the coast.\n\nHistorically, two lighthouses were operated on Baccalieu Island; today both are automated. The lighthouse on the northern end is not operational any more; its light was extinguished in the early 1990s. This lighthouse was replaced as an aid to navigation by an automated light on a skeletal tower. It was originally a brick tower and was later encased in iron. The two storey residence attached was removed after 1950. The old tower's data:\n\n\nFour generations of the Ryan family \"kept the light\" at Baccalieu from 1858 to 1950. Other keepers at Baccalieu included Felix Noonan, Eric Blundon, John Hyde, Linus Walsh, Joseph Hatch, Pat Rice, and principal lightkeeper Raymond Hyde.\n\nIn 1884 the merchant brig Resolven was founded abandoned in the waters off Baccalieu and Catalina, Newfoundland and Labrador. The fate of the crew is unknown.\n\n\n"}

Gaster stated in his extensive preface his view (p. xx) that the \"Chronicles\" were compiled from several Hebrew sources, some quite ancient and others more recent.\n\nThe actual compiler of the chronicles identifies himself as \"Eleasar ben Asher the Levite\" who, according to Gaster, lived in the Rhineland in the 14th century. The most recent events depicted in the \"Chronicles\" refer to the time of the Crusades, but the entire rest of it pertains to the period before AD 70. Among the early sources quoted in the work is the 1st century Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus.\n\nGaster explained that he chose to title it \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\" instead of \"Chronicles of Eleasar\" because of his analysis that Eleasar was merely a compiler, while the enigmatic \"Jeraḥmeel\" is the source most extensively reproduced, following the \"Yosippon\" which is otherwise extant. This 'Jerahmeel' has since been identified as Jerahmeel ben Solomon, thought to have flourished in Italy around 1150. After a thorough discussion of all the textual evidence, Gaster further concluded that, like the closely related \"Sefer haYashar\", it relies on sources ultimately dependent on Isidore of Seville, particularly evident in its mention of \"Franks\" and \"Lombards\" among the Sons of Noah.\n\n\n"}

He commanded square-rigged ships for films, including \"Moby Dick\" and \"Billy Budd\". He also commanded the \"Mayflower II\" on its voyage from the United Kingdom to the United States.\n\nVilliers wrote 44 books, and served as the Chairman (1960-70) and President (1970-74) of the Society for Nautical Research, a Trustee of the National Maritime Museum, and Governor of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society. He was awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross as a Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve during the Second World War. \nAlan John Villiers was the second son of Australian poet and union leader Leon Joseph Villiers. The young Villiers grew up on the docks watching the merchant ships come in and out of the Port of Melbourne and longed for the day on which he too could sail out to sea.\n\nLeaving home at the age of 15, he joined the barque \"Rothesay Bay\" as an apprentice. The \"Rothesay Bay\" operated in the Tasman Sea, trading between Australia and New Zealand. Villiers was a natural seaman. He learned quickly and gained the respect of his shipmates.\n\nAn accident on board the barque \"Lawhill\" beached Villiers in 1922, by then a seasoned Able seaman. He sought employment as a journalist at the \"Hobart Mercury\" newspaper in Tasmania while he recovered from his wounds.\n\nThe call of the sea was strong, and soon Villiers was back at sea when the great explorer and whaler Carl Anton Larsen and his whaling factory ship, the \"Sir James Clark Ross\" came to port with five whale chasers in tow in late 1923. His accounts of the trip would eventually be published as \"Whaling in the Frozen South\". Named for the Antarctica explorer James Clark Ross, the \"Ross\" was the largest whale factory ship in the world, weighing in at 12,000 tons. She was headed for the southern Ross Sea, the last whale stronghold left. Villiers writes: \"We had caught 228, most of them blues, the biggest over 100 feet long. These yielded 17,000 barrels of oil; we had hoped for at least 40,000, with luck 60,000.\"\n\nVilliers' passage on board the \"Herzogin Cecilie\" in 1927 would result in his publication of \"Falmouth for Orders.\" Through it he met Captain Ruben de Cloux, who later became his partner in the barque \"Parma\". He wrote \"By Way of Cape Horn\" after his harrowing experiences on board the \"Grace Harwar\" in 1929.\n\nThe full-rigged ship \"Grace Harwar\" was beautiful as the \"\"wind in her rigging called imperiously as she lay at the pier at Wallaroo\"\". As Villiers stood on the dock, a wharf laborer warned \"\"Don't ship out in her! She's a killer.\"\" The warning would prove true, as Villiers' friend Ronald Walker was lost by the time \"Grace Harwar\" made Ireland. More than 40 years old at the time, the ship had barnacles and algae growing along her waterline. \"Dirty bottoms make slow ships, and slow ships make hard passages.\" Villiers had a desire to document the great sailing ships before it was too late, and \"Grace\" was one of the last working full-riggers. With a small ill-paid crew and no need for coal, such vessels undercut steam ships, and maybe 20 ships were still involved in the trade. The ill-fated voyage took 138 days, the \"Grace\" the last of the fleet for the year.\n\nThe voyage was filmed in both movie (6,000 feet) and still form, serving as a record of significant images of that period.\n\nVilliers reunited with Ruben de Cloux in 1931, becoming a partner with him in the four-masted barque \"Parma\". With de Cloux as captain, \"Parma\" won the unofficial \"grain race\" between the ships of the trade in 1932, arriving in 103 days despite broaching in a gale. In 1933, the ship won in 83 days. Villiers sailed as a passenger on both voyages.\n\nAfter selling his shares back to de Cloux, Villiers purchased the \"Georg Stage\" in 1934. A full rigged sailing ship of 400 tons, originally built in 1882 by Burmeister & Wain in Copenhagen, Denmark, she was employed as a sailing school ship by Stiftelsen Georg Stages Minde. Saving her from the scrapyard, Villiers renamed her the \"Joseph Conrad\", after the author of \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\", \"Typhoon\", and \"The Shadow-Line\", who was also an accomplished seaman.\n\nA sail training pioneer, Villiers circumnavigated the globe with an amateur crew. He used the unique environment of the sea to build character and discipline in his young crew and, with his contemporaries Irving and Exy Johnson, he helped form the modern concept of sail training. It is used not to teach youth for a life at sea, but to use the sea to teach youth for life.\n\nReturning almost two years later, Villiers sold the \"Joseph Conrad\" to George Huntington Hartford. He published two books of his adventures, \"Cruise of the \"Conrad\"\" and \"Stormalong\". The \"Joseph Conrad\" is maintained and operated as a museum ship at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, USA, where she continues to educate the youth of today in the rich history of the age of sail.\n\nIn 1938 Alan Villiers embarked as a passenger on an Arab dhow for a round trip from Oman to the Rufiji delta, and depicted the way of life of Arab sailors and their navigation techniques in a book called \"Sons of Sindbad,\" illustrated with his own photographs.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Villiers was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1940. He was assigned to a convoy of 24 LCI(L)'s, or Landing craft, Infantry (Large). Ordered to deliver them across the Atlantic, with a 40 percent loss rate expected, Villiers got all but one safely across. He commanded \"flights\" of LCI(L)'s on D-Day in the Battle of Normandy, the Invasion of Sicily, and the Burma Campaign in the Far East. By the end of the War, Villiers had been promoted to Commander and awarded the British Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nMarried in 1940 to his second wife Nancie, Villiers settled in Oxford, England, and continued to be active in sailing and writing. He was the Captain of the \"Mayflower II\" in her 1957 maiden voyage across the Atlantic, 337 years after the original \"Mayflower\", and beating her predecessor's time of 67 days by 13 days. He was involved in almost every large Age of Sail ship then still in existence , including the \"Balclutha\", the USCGC \"Eagle\", the \"Falls of Clyde\", the \"Gazela\", the \"Sagres\", and would also prove instrumental in the restoration of the \"Star of India\". From 1963-67 he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to build a replica of HM Bark \"Endeavour\". He advised on the 1962 MGM movie \"Mutiny on the Bounty\". Villiers was a regular contributor to the National Geographic Magazine throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nVilliers produced a travel lecture film, \"Last of the Great Sea Dogs\", which ran at the Dorothy Chandler pavilion in 1976. The film contains 16mm color, filmography of his adventures. There is a digital restored master of the performance with an audio track, narrated by Villiers.\n\nIn 1951, the Portuguese ambassador to the United States, Pedro Teotónio Pereira, a sailing enthusiast and later a close friend of Villiers, invited him to sail on the schooner \"Argus\", a cod fishing four-masted schooner, and to record the last commercial activity ever to make use of sails in ocean-crossings. Villiers wrote \"The Quest Of The Schooner Argus: A voyage to the Grand Banks and Greenland on a modern four masted fishing schooner\". The book was a great success in North America and Europe and was later published in sixteen languages. The voyage made news on the BBC, in the main London newspapers, the \"National Geographic Magazine\", and the \"New York Times\", and the Portuguese government made Villiers a Commendador of the Portuguese Order of St. James of the Sword for outstanding services to literature in March 1951.\n\nIn 2010, the Society for Nautical Research, the Naval Review, and the Britannia Naval Research Association jointly established the annual Alan Villiers Memorial Lecture at St Edmund Hall, Oxford.\n\nCivilization VI includes a quote from Villiers: “There is little man has made that approaches anything in nature, but a sailing ship does.” \n\n\nVillers, Alan, August, 1962.

Fell (November 10, 1808–February 25, 1887) was a Bloomington, Illinois businessman and land owner instrumental in the establishment of communities throughout Central Illinois and for the founding of Illinois State University. A close friend of Abraham Lincoln it was Fell who urged him to challenge his opponent, Stephen A. Douglas, to their famous series of debates.\n\nFell was born in rural southeastern Chester County, Pennsylvania, to Quaker parents of modest means, Rebecca (Roman) and Jesse Fell. He attended local Friends schools as well as a private boy's academy and briefly taught in local public schools before migrating to Ohio to study law in 1828. In 1831 Fell moved to Illinois, opening Bloomington's first law offices and beginning his career in real estate. Fell was especially active during the Illinois land boom in the late 1830s; with James Allin, Fell co-founded the town of Clinton, Illinois and worked to create DeWitt County arranging for his brother, Kersey H. Fell, to become the clerk responsible for organizing the new county. He established Livingston County, which he named, and backed the founders of Pontiac, Illinois, which he also named. Fell invested in lands in Bloomington, Chicago, Milwaukee, Danville, and other places in central and eastern Illinois.\n\nFell also founded Bloomington's first newspaper, \"The Bloomington Observer and McLean County Advocate\" in 1837 and, after several years running a fruit orchard in Adams County, returned to McLean County and work as an agent for the former Alton & Springfield Railroad to secure the right of way through McLean County. He helped found the town of Towanda and with his brother founded the town of Dwight. and later defeated an effort to have the railroad bypass his extensive land holdings in Pontiac. He sold lots in Decatur, Lexington, Clinton, El Paso, Joliet, and LeRoy and in 1855 he purchased timber land and began operation a sawmill near Ullin in southern Illinois.\n\nIn 1854 Fell arranged for the Chicago and Mississippi Railroad to cross the Illinois Central Railroad north of Bloomington where he had founded the town of North Bloomington. In 1860, Illinois State Normal University relocated there from a site in downtown Bloomington, resulting in the town being renamed Normal in 1865. Fell was an enthusiastic arborist who developed an extensive park around his home, and was known for planting trees in his real estate holdings.\n\nFell died at his home in Normal, Illinois on February 25, 1887. The Normal Town Council declared that through his \"untiring and disinterested efforts\" he had secured the crossing of the two railroads and they passed a resolution stating that, \"Normal without Jesse Fell is comparatively like a family without a father.\"\n\n\n He was nationally known for his love of trees. Holder was a partner in many of Fell's projects...In the summer of 1869 Fell traveled to northwestern Iowa and selected a tract of about forty sections, more than 25,000 acres (100 km2) of land.

The grunt sculpin generally remains close to shore and is often found in empty giant barnacle shells. It was first identified by Albert Günther in 1874 and was named in honor of naturalist John Richardson. The common name comes from reports that the fish vibrate or \"grunt\" when held. Its defining feature is its tendency to “hop” along the ocean floor on its orange fins. The short, stout body of the grunt sculpin has a long, small mouth which is adapted for eating smaller prey.\n\nIt is a member of the Actinopterygii class which are the ray-finned fishes. It is further classified into the order Scorpaeniformes commonly known as the mail-cheeked fishes. The superfamily Cottidae which is classified within this order includes \"R. richardsonii\" and all other sculpins. However, the grunt sculpin is the only member of the Rhamphocottidae family.\n\nIts name comes from “rhamp” meaning snout and “cottus” meaning sculpin based on its physical characteristics. The second part of its name is in honor of the naturalist John Richardson.\n\nThe largest recorded length for the grunt sculpin is only 8.9 cm. Its main features are its big head, short, stout body, long pig snout, and orange fins. The body is usually a yellow color with brown stripes contrasted by its very orange pectoral fins. Compared to other sculpins, it has a small mouth with a longer snout affecting its feeding habits. Although it can swim in an abnormal manner with its head pointing up, it mainly “hops” along the bottom of the ocean using its several pectoral fins. It’s phenotypically classified by its pectoral fins being separated from the upper lobe, the presence of anal and dorsal fin stays, and its hypural-parhypural bone being made of a singular piece.\n\nThe grunt sculpin is found around the coasts in the eastern Pacific Ocean, stretching from southern California to the Bering Sea, although it has also been seen off of the coast of Japan. In these regions, the grunt sculpin resides in a variety of habitats such as rocky shores, kelp forests, sandy beaches, and coral reefs. In these habitats, it generally remains in shallower waters (as shallow as two meters) but it has been found at depths of 165 meters. It prefers to shelter in empty giant barnacles, but it will also live in debris under piers and floats in the absence of giant barnacles. Within the barnacles, the grunt sculpin will stick out its fins and wave them around to try to mimic the appearance and movement of the cirri of a living barnacle.\n\nThe grunt sculpin has a small mouth for a sculpin, therefore it mainly preys on small crustaceans but sometimes small fishes and worms as well. Their main predators are rockcod and other carnivorous fishes. Classifying whether \"R. richardsonii\" are ram or suction feeders is difficult as it has physical features of both types and it feeds on both prey types (elusive and grasping) with similar success, though it fares better with smaller elusive prey. Ram feeders envelop the prey with a quick movement of their body while suction feeders use negative pressure to draw water and prey into their mouths. Elusive prey are prey that can initiate evasive maneuvers while grasping prey tend to hold onto the substrate to avoid being eaten. \"R. richarsonii\" tend to attack with lower velocities and from shorter distances (less than half its body length away) in comparison to other Cottidae fishes. \n\nSpawning generally occurs at the rocky shores from August to October. The female is the dominant mate in reproduction and will chase and trap the male within a rocky crevice until she has laid all her eggs (about 150). The eggs will hatch 16-20 weeks after fertilization depending on the temperature conditions. Larvae forms have been reported from March to June. The larvae must remain near the shore as that is the habitat in which the grunt sculpin can survive. If the larva is lost to planktonic dispersal in the open ocean then the fish is unlikely to survive. How the larvae are adapted and influenced by environmental factors to remain close to shore is unclear.\n\n"}
{"id": "2083176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083176", "title": "Dragon Poker", "text": "Dragon Poker\n\nDragon Poker is a fictional card game from the \"MythAdventures\" series by Robert Asprin, featured primarily in the book \"Little Myth Marker\". The game is an absurdly complex Poker variant, with the same basic rules as stud poker but with different names for the suits and face cards and the added concept of \"conditional modifiers\". A conditional modifier is a modification to the rules based on variables such as the day of the week, the number of players, chair position, which hand of the game it is, etc. As a result, the game quickly gets ridiculously complicated.\n\nAsprin has never provided the full rules for Dragon Poker; it is used in the book only as a plot device in a parody of professional gambling, and not as a fully developed game. This has not stopped fans from creating a set of \"Rules For Dragon Poker\".\n\nDragon Poker is played with a standard 52-card deck with the usual four suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. However, the Dragon Poker deck's face cards are Elves, Ogres, Unicorns, and Dragons, corresponding to jacks, queens, kings, and aces, respectively. (Like aces in poker, Dragons can be either the high card or the low card in a straight, but not both.)\n\nDragon Poker is a kind of stud poker. That is, each player plays the cards he gets, with no chance to draw better cards. Unlike most poker variations, the scoring hands are made up of six cards rather than five, and a total of nine cards are dealt to each player. Thus, a total of five players can play for each deck.\n\nThe game is played with all cards on the table, with four face-down \"hole\" cards and five cards face up. The hole cards are the first three and the last one to each player. (Down - down - down - up - up - up - up - up - down).\n\nWith six-card hands, the variations of possible hands are far more numerous than in standard poker. Thus, the standard order does not necessarily apply.\n\nThe hands, with descriptions, from lowest to highest:\n\n\nA few hands require some explanation:\nNormal hands — One and two pairs, three of a kind, full house, and four of a kind are exactly the same as in five-card poker, with an extra, \"don't care\" card. Flushes, straights, and straight flushes are similar to their counterparts, but that the sixth card must fit with the same rule as the other five.\n\nAdded hands — Three pairs is as it would seem: three pairs of cards put together. A full belly is two sets of threes of a kind, and a full dragon is a four of a kind plus a pair.\n\n\nThe Corps-a-Corps hand — The \"corps-a-corps\" hand was given no official definition in the book \"Little Myth Marker\".\n\nDragon Poker has six rounds of betting: once after each round of up cards is dealt (the fourth through eighth), plus a final betting round before everyone shows their hole cards. As in traditional poker, the person who starts each round is the one with the best hand \"showing\", that is, from just all the face-up cards.\n\nWhat makes Dragon Poker so intriguing (and confusing) is the concept of conditional modifiers. These are a standard set of rules that, depending on the day, weather, number of people playing, and other factors, determines what cards are wild, what cards are \"dead\" (unusable), and other subtle changes in how the game is played.\n\nIn the books, the rules delineating conditional modifiers vary as well, depending on the dimension where the game is being played. It is not known if there exists a set or rules for modifiers that applies to Earth's dimension, nor, if they exist, what they are.\n\nIf a player makes a mistake in his interpretation of the current hand's conditional modifiers, so that he undervalues his own hand, the opponent is not required to point out the error (although he is not forbidden from doing so, either).\n\nA few of the modifiers mentioned in \"Little Myth Marker\":\n\n\n Hand Combinations Odds (6 of 6)\n\nHere \"N\" means \"natural\" (that is, without any wild cards), and \"W\" means \"using at least one wild card\".\n\nNotes:\n--At least 1 Wild ==> 13,915,044 (43%)\n--exactly 1 Wild ==> 10,395,840 (32%)\n\nNotice that certain hands (2 pair, 3 pair, full belly) will be natural-only hands, because wild cards can make better hands. (For example, two pair using a wild card is no longer two pair, but three of a kind.) This effect boosts the probabilities of some high-scoring hands, such as straights, at the expense of lower-scoring hands.\n\n\n"}

Originally a small village near Khoraka, Soahwa merged with Khoraka after several years of human settlement. The original village is part of the main town (Khoraka) and is called \"Ward #1\" or \"Purana Sohawa\" (literally \"old Sohawa\").\n\nThe most famous village is Kot Dhamiak (Fort of Dhamials), which has existed since the time of Sultan Raja Dhami Khan. It was a fort at the time when Shahab Din conquered this area in the 16th century, as well as being the place where Shehab-ud-din Ghori was murdered by Khokhars. The village named Bishindaur which was changed to Dewan-e-Hazoori by Mian Mohammad Nawaz Shareef at the request of Majlis-e-Qadria Dewan-e-Hazoori is located about 5 miles from Sohawa. Bishandour was named after Bishan Singh who ruled the area and was the grandson of Raja Ram Singh who was the ruler of Amber, and head of the Kachwaha Rajput clan, from 1688 to 1699. Bishandour village is named after the great saint Dewan-e-Hazoori. Today, a big market in the village is where most of the community do their shopping.\n\nDewan e Hazoori was the biggest food market of Sohawa before partition. Dewan e Hazoori has an annual religious event for the birth of the Wali Haji Hafiz Syed Muhammed Abdullah, commonly known as Dewan E Hazoori. There are a darbar and a mosque at the heart of the village, where people flock to every Thursday to visit and pay their respects.

Although it was numbered as the first piece in the trio of piano sonatas which were published as Opus 31 in 1803, Beethoven actually finished it after the Op. 31 No. 2, the \"Tempest Sonata\".\n\nDue to his dissatisfaction with the classical style of music, Beethoven pledged to take a new path of musical composition and style. The Opus 31 works are the first examples of Beethoven's new and unconventional ideas, an attempt to make a name for himself in the annals of music history. For example, the first movement, unlike most sonata allegro forms in which the second theme of the exposition is dominant, the second theme is in B major and B minor, the mediant of the original key. Beethoven would later continue to use the mediant and submediant as expositional goals for major-key sonata-form movements, such as the first movements of the Waldstein and Hammerklavier sonatas, the Archduke trio, the triple concerto and the thirteenth string quartet, as well as the finale to the seventh symphony. It is important to take into account that these pieces were written after the famous Heiligenstadt Testament of 1802. \n\nThis sonata is light, breezy and has touches of humour and irony in its movements. Critics say that the Opus 31 works show now a more pronounced \"Beethovenian\" sense of style that will become more evident in later, mature works.\n\nThe sonata consists of three movements. A typical performance lasts about 20 minutes.\n\nThe first movement begins in an animated fashion. The humorous main theme is littered with brisk, semiquaver passages, and chords written in a stuttering fashion, suggesting that the hands are unable to play in unison with one another. The second subject in the exposition alternates between B major and B minor; this tendency to alternate between keys became typical later in Beethoven's career. \n\nWith long, drawn out trills and reflective pauses, the second movement in C major is the more sentimental movement. Apart from the \"Hammerklavier Sonata\"'s \"Adagio\" and the 32nd sonata's second movement, this is the longest slow movement of Beethoven in the piano sonatas (around 11 minutes). According to many great pianists (e.g. Edwin Fischer and András Schiff), this movement is a parody of Italian opera and Beethoven's contemporaries, who were much more popular than Beethoven at the beginning of the 19th century. Schiff explained this theory in his master class of this sonata; he said it is totally uncharacteristic of Beethoven because it is not economical, it is incredibly long, everything is too much ornamented, it is filled with \"show-off cadenzas (...) who are trying to make a cheap effect\" and bel canto-like elements and rhythms (on them Schiff said \"it's very beautiful, but it's alien to Beethoven's nature\").\n\nThe last movement is similar in character to the first movement: light, enthusiastic, and youthful. Here, a single simple theme is varied, ornamented, syncopated, modulated throughout the piece. After a brief Adagio section, the piece ends with a Presto Coda.\n\n"}

Connective tissue is any type of biological tissue with an extensive extracellular matrix that supports, binds together, and protects organs. These tissues form a framework, or matrix, for the body, and are composed of two major structural protein molecules: collagen and elastin. There are many different types of collagen protein in each of the body's tissues. Elastin has the capability of stretching and returning to its original length—like a spring or rubber band. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues that attach bone to bone) and skin. In patients with connective tissue disease, it is common for collagen and elastin to become injured by inflammation (ICT). Many connective tissue diseases feature abnormal immune system activity with inflammation in tissues as a result of an immune system that is directed against one's own body tissues (autoimmunity).\n\nDiseases in which inflammation or weakness of collagen tends to occur are also referred to as collagen diseases. Collagen vascular diseases can be (but are not necessarily) associated with collagen and blood vessel abnormalities and that are autoimmune in nature.

The establishment of the Commission followed various unsuccessful attempts by the Federal Government to impose greater regulation upon the conduct of industrial relations in that industry.\n\nThe Royal Commission commenced on 29 August 2001 and was overseen by a sole Royal Commissioner, The Honourable Justice Terence Cole . Justice Cole handed the commission's final report to the Governor-General on 24 February 2003; and the report was tabled in parliament on 26 and 27 March 2003.\n\nAlthough the Commission found no evidence of organised criminal activity, it did articulate a case that the industry was characterised by lawlessness in the conduct of industrial relations. It recommended sweeping changes to industrial relations laws applicable to the industry. The government's attempts to implement those recommendations stalled in 2004, but were revived in 2005 after the Howard government secured control of the Senate. The Royal Commission led to the enactment of the and the establishment of the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABCC), an independent statutory authority responsible for monitoring and promoting workplace relations in the Australian building and construction industry. The ABCC was active between October 2005 and May 2012, when, following enactment of the , its functions were superseded by Fair Work Building and Construction, an agency of the Australian government. The agency was re-established in December 2016 as the Australian Building and Construction Commission.\n\nIn May 1997 the Federal Government, with agreement from the States, prepared a National Building Industry Code of Practice. The government supplemented the Code with Implementation Guidelines. Fundamentally, the Code and the Guidelines were an attempt to regulate the conduct of industrial relations on construction projects funded by government, through the medium of contract rather than legislation.\n\nIn July 1997 the (then) Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business formed a 'Workplace Reform Group' targeting four industries for reform: the meat processing industry, the coal mining industry, the building and construction industry and the waterfront industry. The Workplace Relations Act and the Trade Practices Act 1974 were to provide the legal tools to deliver reform. The 1998 waterfront dispute was a reflection of the focus placed on these important industries.\n\nAt about the time that the Royal Commission was announced, there had been, for some time, open conflict within the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. On the one side, led by Divisional Secretary John Sutton and NSW Divisional Branch Secretary Andrew Ferguson, forces associated with the old Building Workers' Industrial Union were seeking to maintain their control over the Division. On the other side, led by Victorian and WA Divisional Branch Secretaries, Martin Kingham and Kevin Reynolds, forces associated with the old Builders Labourers Federation were seeking to exert greater influence within the union. The battle for control over the Divisional Conference led to a range of court cases. At one point, the Divisional Secretary, John Sutton, made allegations of organised criminal activity within the union. These allegations were aired on the ABC 4Corners program, and widely cited by government ministers as justifying the calling of a royal commission.\n\nIn April 2001 the Minister for Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, asked the Employment Advocate to provide a report \"regarding behaviour in the building industry\". In May 2001, the Employment Advocate provided a report which summarised statistics concerning complaints received by his office relating to alleged breaches of Freedom of Association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act; 'coercion' in agreement making, right of entry and strike pay provisions of the Act.\n\nThe report criticised other law enforcement agencies, alleging that complaints \"will simply not be actioned with any priority, or at all\".\n\nThis criticism mirrored certain criticisms levelled at the Victoria Police, after the 1998 waterfront dispute, to the effect that police should have been more aggressively involved in a picket-breaking role, rather than merely keeping the peace.\n\nThe report alleged that, \"ill willed\" people have ample opportunities to \"cause major disruption to a site\" by misuse of occupational health and safety procedures.\n\nThe report alleged misuse of various industry funds, including trust funds established to preserve employee entitlements such as leave pay and superannuation: \"There have been allegations that senior union appointed trustees have sought to influence the investment decisions of at least one of these trusts for political and/or industrial purposes.\"\n\nMost dramatically, the report alleged that union officials accepted secret commissions, engaged in bribery, and criminal corrupt conduct.\n\nThe report concluded that 'there certainly appears to be a case for a broader investigation of the industry', and that 'it would require special investigative powers to gather and elicit information beyond that normally available to a government authority'.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2001, the Governor-General issued Commonwealth Letters Patent pursuant to \"the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia\", the and other enabling powers\" appointing The Honourable Justice Terence Cole as the sole Commissioner and the commission's terms of reference. The commissioner was directed \"...to inquire into certain matters relating to the building and construction industry...\"\n\nSubsequent to the Royal Commission, Cole was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005 for \"service to the judiciary, particularly judicial administration, to reform of the building and construction industry, and to the community through the Australian Naval Reserve and conservation and arts organisations.\"\n\nThe Commissioner was appointed to investigate certain matters in relation to the building and construction industry. Those matters were defined in the Letters Patent as follows:\n\nThe powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the .\n\nRoyal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the \"Royal Commissions Act\" or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is a fine of or six months imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants.\n\n\nAt the opening of public hearings in October 2001, the Commission published a proposed 'practice note' which would govern how parties were to be granted leave to appear before it. The practice note required that any party wishing to be represented and to appear before the Commission must, as a condition of such grant of leave, provide the Commission with a statement setting out all matters within that person's knowledge as to the subject matter of the inquiry. Robert Richter QC (appearing on behalf of a WA official of the CFMEU) described the proposed practice notes as requiring that parties submit to a \"stalinist obligation to inform\"\n\nThe Commission conducted open hearings on 171 days, and private (closed) hearings on 22 days.\n\nSee generally\n\n\nThere were two legal proceedings brought against the Cole Commission during 2002. The first, brought in the name of Martin Kingham and others, was conducted on behalf of the Victorian Building Unions Divisional Branch of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. The second, brought in the name of Andrew Ferguson and others, was conducted on behalf of the NSW Divisional Branch of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. Neither of these challenges were successful.\n\nThe applicants sought administrative law relief to prevent the Commissioner conducting the Royal Commission in accordance with the provisions of pars 12 to 15 of the Commission's Practice Note 2. His decision to do so was challenged under ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).\n\nThe Practice note sought to impose conditions on a person's right to cross-examine witnesses appearing before the Royal Commission. Justice Heely summarised the applicant's argument this way:\n\nThese arguments were rejected:\n\nThe applicants filed an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, but this appeal was abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2002 the applicants made an application to the Commissioner that he disqualify himself from, in effect, making findings of fact or recommendations in relation to New South Wales which may have an adverse impact on the applicants. On 6 September 2002 the Commissioner published reasons for his decision to dismiss the application made to him.\n\nIn this proceeding the applicants claimed that the Commissioner has shown actual bias towards them or, alternatively, by his conduct has given rise to a reasonable apprehension that he is biased towards them. They also asserted that they have been denied procedural fairness by reason of the process of inquiry adopted by the Royal Commission.\n\nThe Court dismissed the application. The Court rejected the contention that the Commissioner by the First Report made findings which directly and adversely affected the interests of the applicants. The Court also rejected the contention that the First Report shows that the Commissioner was, or could reasonably be apprehended to be, so committed to conclusions which he had already formed that he would be incapable of altering those conclusions.\n\n\nAn Interim Building Industry Taskforce Report was delivered on 15 August 2002; and a Building Industry Taskforce Report delivered. The Commissioner presented his final report to the Governor-General on 24 February 2003; and the report was tabled in Parliament on 26 and 27 March 2003.\n\nThe Government responded to the 212 recommendations of the Royal Commission; allocated more than $136 million in the 2004-05 Federal Budget; and appointed Colin Thatcher as a member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.\n\nOn 2 April 2003, Federal Cabinet decided to extend the operation of the Building Industry Task Force, pending the establishment of the proposed Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC). Cabinet also supported separate legislation to regulate the construction industry. On 25 March 2004, the Minister announced that the taskforce would become a permanent body, and would 'continue to operate until the \"Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill\" is passed by this Parliament', and the ABCC established.\n\nNil.\n\nThe \"Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003\" was tabled in Parliament; with an Explanatory Memorandum circulated by Minister. The Minister delivered his Second Reading Speech on 6 November 2003. In 2004, the Parliamentary Library published an analysis of the Bill's history. In October 2003 the Senate referred the Bill to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee received submissions, conducted hearings, and tabled its Report on 21 June 2004. The Committee, by a majority composed of Senators from the Democrats and Labor, recommended that the Senate oppose the government's legislation. Government senators on the Committee, in minority, recommended that the legislation be passed. Passage of the Bill stalled.\n\nThe Coalition government was returned at the 2004 election and secured control of the Senate with effect from July 2005. On 4 November 2004, the Minister for Workplace Relations Kevin Andrews announced that the legislation would be reintroduced into the new Parliament. The revised 2005 Bill passed both houses and was enacted, with Assent given to the on 12 September 2005.\n\nThe Act enabled the establishment of an independent statutory authority, the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner (ABCC). The role of the ABCC was to monitor and promote appropriate standards of conduct throughout the building and construction industry. The ABCC operated between 2005 and 2012.\n\nThe Commission's own estimate of its expenditures, as at the date of publishing its report, was that it had spent approximately 60 million. This figure makes this Royal Commission one of the most expensive in Australia's history.\n\n"}

Its common title was taken from the name of its chairperson, NSW Supreme Court judge Athol Moffitt. Its formal title was the Royal Commission of Inquiry in respect of certain matters relating to allegations of organised crime in clubs.\n\nIn August 1973, the New South Wales Government appointed Mr Justice Moffitt to head the Commission. It was set up to address public and media concerns about the growing extent of organised crime in NSW and to investigate specific allegations that the Bally poker machine company now Bally Technologies, -- which was allegedly linked to the Mafia in the United States—was seeking to expand its interests in Australia, and that this might act as a conduit for Mafia-style organised crime to develop and diversify in Australia.\n\nPolice investigations into organised crime had been inconclusive, official reports were contradictory and often widely criticised, and both the then NSW Police Commissioner Norman Allan and NSW Premier Robert Askin (who were themselves alleged to have been involved in organised crime) repeatedly denied that there was any sort of organised crime in NSW or that there were any corrupt links between criminals and police or government officials.\n\nWidespread allegations of official corruption in the NSW police force and the NSW government had been highlighted by a string of highly publicised scandals, notably the so-called \"Arantz Affair\", in which police computer expert Phillip Arantz was sacked from the NSW Police Service for leaking information to the media, after he discovered that the NSW police had systematically under-reporting crime statistics over a period of years. There was also increasing public concern about the escalation of the trade in illegal drugs in NSW in the late 1960s and early 1970s, especially in regard to the rapid growth of the heroin trade.\n\nThe first witness called before the Commission was investigative journalist Bob Bottom, whose media reports on organised crime had contributed to the growing pressure for a high-level investigation into these matters. Other notable witnesses included career criminal Lenny McPherson, the man typically referred to as Sydney's \"Mr Big\". Shortly before his death, Justice Moffitt revealed that McPherson (who had since died) had been a paid informant to the Commission.\n\nIn his final report, handed down in 1974, Justice Moffitt found there was a real danger that organised crime from overseas would infiltrate Australia. He identified the difficulties investigating organised crime presents to law enforcement agencies. Among his recommendations was a \"frank and drastic review of the methods of investigation of organised crime of overseas and local origin and that particular procedures be established appropriate to this as a special class of crime\"'.\n\nHe further recommended that a special squad of police be trained and established to deal with aspects of organised crime and that a 'task force' method be incorporated within this special squad.\n"}

{"id": "2083240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083240", "title": "Head (music)", "text": "Head (music)\n\nIn its broadest sense, the head of a piece of music is its main theme, particularly in jazz, where the term takes on a more specific set of connotations. In other types of music, \"head\" may refer to the first or most prominent section of a song. The term may, though obtusely, be applied to classical music, insofar as classical pieces generally bear similar thematic elements, but the preferred term in this instance is (main) theme or subject. The term \"head\" is most often used in jazz and may refer to the thematic melody, an instance of it in a performance of the song, or a more abstract compilation of ideas as to what the song is. It may also, though uncommonly, refer to the first section of the melody, or the theme riff in the melody.\n\nThere is a slightly related musical direction, D.C. or da capo (Italian, \"from head\"), which means to go back to the very beginning of the sheet music and play to the end, typically ignoring all repeat signs.\n\nThe idea a \"head\" represents comprises a combination of elements. No one piece of written music defines what the \"head\" of many jazz tunes really is, but a boiler-plate jazz chart, which is often only a page long in large print, will tell you:\n\n\nas well as more general information such as\n\n\nThe form is an even more general and abstract concept dealing with the theoretical context in which the actual music is being played: the chord progression, its sections and other miscellaneous events such as kicks or time changes are all important information that the performers must keep track of. Two important standard forms over which hundreds of heads have been written are the 12-bar blues and rhythm changes. Some heads are based on the forms of other tunes, such as Charlie Parker's \"Ornithology\", which is based on Morgan Lewis's \"How High the Moon\".\n\nFake books may contain anywhere from a handful to hundreds of charts like these, occasionally stretching into two pages and on rare occasions going further and requiring page turns. There are many heads that are considered such a part of standard jazz repertoire (see jazz standard) that professional players are expected to know them by memory and be able to perform them in a variety of ways on the spot.\n\nIn playing the actual music, the head refers to any time the band or musician plays the theme to the song. Usually this happens once or twice at the beginning and the end of a performance. For example, many Clifford Brown recordings characteristically feature a short piano intro, the head, several choruses of solos and a recapitulation of the head followed by an outro coda. Although it most commonly is, the head does not need to be played at both the beginning and the end of a performance, and is occasionally played in the middle, for instance between solos.\n\nHead In and Head Out are commonly used to refer to the first and last heads [of a piece] played.\n\nJazz musicians often give each other the \"head\" or \"top\" cue by patting their hand on top of their head, which is usually meant to make sure everybody \"goes back to the head,\" or starts playing the head again the next time the \"top of the form\" comes around. On the unfortunate occasion this may be due to confusion about \"where\" the top of the form actually is if the musicians get off-sync with one another, or a frantic attempt to regain composure and finish the performance, as playing the head to end a piece is default jam session protocol.\n\nJazz musicians are frequently called upon to play a series of songs in short order with no planning, either at jam sessions or impromptu gigs. Therefore, it is important for professionals to know as wide a variety of tunes as possible and be able to play them proficiently. Most of the time this means memorizing the melody, chords and anything else important about playing the song with a band. Sometimes there will be fake books available at jam sessions, and sometimes it is easy to recall a tune while playing it or learn it on the spot, but for the most part it is expected that professional jazz musicians have a very large vocabulary of tunes available by memory.\n\n"}

Unlike the other three plebiscites held in Alberta, the 1957 vote was not held in conjunction with a provincial election. At the time, the Alberta Liquor Control Board operated only a few stores from which liquor could be legally purchased. The plebiscite asked voters in every district if they were in favour of adding extra ALCB outlets.\n\nThe province of Alberta decided to hold a plebiscite after divisive debate in the legislature on the need to deal with demands to loosen regulatory restrictions to liquor that had been in place since the Prohibition era.\n\nThe vote to hold a plebiscite had carried on a recorded division by a single vote after much debate.\n\nIn addition to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment on an issue. The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers on whether or not to establish a compulsory egg marketing board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided to hold it in conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the sentiment of Egg producers could be tested at the same time as voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.\nA second vote among egg producers in summer 1958 brought in a 'Yes\" result.\n\nIn Calgary, and Edmonton, as well as the parts of Gleichen, Banff-Cochrane and Clover Bar, that were within the Calgary and Edmonton city limits, a second question was put on the ballot asking if \"mixed drinking\" should be permitted in beer parlours.

She was 12 when she received a full scholarship to the Musician's Institute in Hollywood, where she studied vocal performance, music theory and song-writing. \n\nShe also studied martial arts and stunts: she is an accomplished Blackbelt in Wushu, Kung Fu and a Stunt performer and has trained at the National Wushu Training Center and Impact Stunts.\n\nAt age 14, Q'orianka portrayed Pocahontas in the Academy Award-nominated motion picture \"The New World\" (2005), directed by Terrence Malick. Her performance was critically acclaimed and won her the National Board of Review's best breakthrough performance of 2006, the 2006 Alma Award for best Latin American actress in a feature film, and numerous other award nominations. The film was released in December 2005 to mixed reviews. The film was a critical success, receiving several positive reviews and award nominations, but it was shown in only 811 theatres worldwide. It yielded a relatively low box office gross.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Kilcher began filming the independent film \"The Power of Few\", which she produced through her own production company, Entertainment On-Q. She played the title role in the feature film \"Princess Kaiulani\" (2009). The film, about the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, was released in May 2010 to negative reviews. But Kilcher received positive feedback for her role, with Roger Ebert writing that \"she evokes great depth and sympathy in her role and seems to have created Kaiulani from the inside out.\"\n\nIn 2009, Kilcher performed in \"The People Speak\", a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of common people in the U.S., based on historian Howard Zinn's \"A People's History of the United States\".\n\nIn 2010, Kilcher played Pinti in the family drama \"Shouting Secrets\". The film won Best Film at the 36th American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco and Kilcher was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Kilcher also portrayed Kerrianne Larkin, daughter of Chibs Telford and Fiona Larkin, in the television series \"Sons of Anarchy\".\n\nIn 2011, Kilcher played Tiger Lily in \"Neverland\", a version of the Peter Pan story that aired on the Syfy Channel.\n\nIn 2013, Kilcher portrayed Rayen in \"Running Deer\", an award-winning short film produced and directed by Brent Ryan Green through Toy Gun Films.\n\nKilcher appeared in the 2019 adventure film \"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\" as the Inca princess.\n\nKilcher has made a commitment to human rights and environmental activism. She speaks on behalf of causes to achieve what she regards as environmental justice and basic human rights. Traveling frequently to speak at youth events, colleges and universities, Kilcher has been a featured keynote speaker for organizations such as Amnesty International, the International Forum on Globalization, Amazon Watch IFIP and the United Nations panel discussions titled \"Indigenous Peoples: Human Rights, Dignity and Development with Identity,\" in collaboration with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nShe lends her celebrity, voice and energy as spokeswoman, collaborator and supporter to several international and national NGOs and organizations, such as youth ambassador for Amnesty International (Global Youth Ambassador for Woman's Rights), AIDESEP (spokesperson and voice), Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest Federations, the Community School for the Arts foundation (volunteer/spokesperson) and Thursdays Child (youth counselor) Turning The Tides (volunteer/spokesperson), Save Americas Forests, IDEM (South Dakota Youth Project) and is a spokesperson for the American Literacy Campaign.\n\nWorking with the National Endowment For the Arts on their \"The Big Read\" campaign, she will record a book review. Kilcher has read Howard Zinn's \"The People Speak\" in staged readings. She joined the cast for the first \"People Speak\" film series.\n\nKilcher recently launched her own youth-driven human rights and environmental organization \"On-q Initiative\", to connect young Hollywood with youth activist leaders and projects from around the world in support of environmental sustainability, corporate accountability, and basic human rights. Through her production company, IQ-Films, Kilcher is producing several cause-driven documentaries and youth-programming projects.\n\nOn June 11, 2009 she visited Lima to support indigenous peoples' rights in the Amazon Bagua, Peru. In 2007, Kilcher won the Brower Youth Award, a premier environmental award, for her work in persuading Occidental Petroleum to withdraw from the Peruvian Amazon valley. She received the Young Hollywood Green Award.\n\nOn June 1, 2010, Kilcher and her mother were arrested after Kilcher chained herself to the gates in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. while her mother poured black paint on her to signify oil. Kilcher was protesting President Barack Obama's meeting with Peruvian President Alan García, accusing the latter of selling land in the Amazon rainforest to corporations while suppressing indigenous protests. She and her mother were charged with disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped on June 6, 2011 after the two completed community service.\n\nOn September 4, 2015, Kilcher was part of a group that sang \"Love Song to the Earth\". The song aims at raising awareness of climate change, with all proceeds benefiting Friends of the Earth U.S. and the UN Foundation. Kilcher and several \"Love Song\" singers performed in Washington, DC before Pope Francis' address to the U.S. Congress.\n\n"}

Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short. It was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese.\n\nTunneling his way to the Coachella Valley for the \"big carrot festival therein,\" Bugs Bunny gets lost, and wanders into a Mexican bullring in the middle of a bullfight between Toro the Bull and a very scared matador. Bugs looks at his map and famously declares: \"I knew I shoulda taken that left toin at Albukoikee\". As he asks the matador for directions, the matador escapes into the stands, leaving Bugs to fend for himself against Toro. After irritating Bugs and getting a slap for \"steamin' up [his] tail,\" Toro chalks up the points of his horns like a pool cue and rams the rabbit out of the bullring. As he sails into the air, a furious Bugs decides to exact revenge and says his famous line: \"Of course you realize \"this\" means war\".\n\nToro takes his applause for claiming his latest victim (and pushes a bead across a scoring wire, as in billiards), but it is short-lived because Bugs re-enters the bullring in matador garb. Bugs defeats Toro using an anvil hidden behind his cape. While Toro is still dazed from his collision, and accompanied by a lively underscore of \"La Cucaracha\", Bugs makes the bull follow the cape to a bull shield; Toro's horns pierce it. Bugs bends the horns down like nails and, thinking he has got Toro at bay, makes fun of him using puns (\"What a gulli-bull, what a nin-cow-poop\"), unaware that the bull can detach his horns and strike back. Toro proceeds to bash Bugs in the head, which knocks him unconscious.\n\nWhile Toro sharpens his horns, Bugs interrupts him by placing an elastic band around the horns and using it as a giant slingshot to smack him in the face with a boulder. As Bugs accepts accolades from the crowd, Toro charges, catching the rabbit in the posterior and pushing him through a wall. Bugs then returns, this time wearing a large sombrero, doing a little dance, and slapping Toro on the face in tempo to the tune of \"Las Chiapanecas\". Toro tries to go toward him twice but is slapped each time. Bugs dances more and then disappears under the sombrero, but not before honking Toro's nose.\n\nWhile Toro once again sharpens his horns (this time with an angry face), Bugs has prepared a booby trap for the bull, composed of a double-barreled shotgun hidden behind the cape. Toro charges the cape and somehow the shotgun previously in Bugs's hand enters Toro's body and fills his tail. When he flicks his tail and it hits the ground, a bullet fires from each of his horns, one at a time. Taking advantage of that, Toro chases Bugs, shooting at him, but eventually runs out of bullets. Toro \"reloads\" by swallowing several \"elephant bullets\" (with explosive heads), but when he attempts to shoot again, he instead explodes.\n\nBugs taunts Toro once again by calling him, among other things, an \"im-bess-ile\" and an \"ultra-maroon\", but realizes that he is trapped in front of barred gates. As Toro races toward him, Bugs pretends to await certain death (by writing a will and saying his prayers), and at the last second, opens the gates like a garage door, sending Toro out of the bullring and into the horizon. Furious, Toro races back to the bullring, not anticipating that Bugs has laid out on his path a Rube Goldberg–like contraption of axle grease, a ramp, and some platforms. The grease and ramp send Toro airborne over some glue, a sheet of sandpaper, a protruding matchstick, and a barrel of TNT which explodes when Toro flies by. Still in the air and in shock, Toro finally crashes into a wooden bull shield.\n\nThe cartoon ends with the unconscious bull's hindquarters sticking out of the shield, and the victorious Bugs holding up the cape with the words \"THE END\" written on it.\n\nIn his biography \"Chuck Amuck,\" Chuck Jones claims that he made this cartoon after producer Eddie Selzer burst into Jones' workspace one day and announced, for no readily apparent reason, that there was nothing funny about bullfighting and no cartoons about it were to be made. Since Selzer had, in Jones' opinion, consistently proven himself to be wrong about absolutely everything (having once barred Jones from doing any cartoons featuring Pepé Le Pew, on the grounds that he perceived them as not being funny, which led to Jones and Maltese to do \"For Scent-imental Reasons\", which won an Oscar, which Selzer accepted), the only possible option was to make the cartoon. The sounds of the crowd and the bull are recorded from a genuine bullfighting crowd in Barcelona, Spain. The boulder to the face gag was reused from \"Rabbit Punch\" five years earlier, which was also directed by Chuck Jones.\n\n\n"}

While in college, Macready sustained a permanent scar on his right cheek after being thrust through the windshield of a Ford Model T when the vehicle skidded on an icy road and hit a telephone pole. He was stitched up by a veterinarian, but he caught scarlet fever during the ordeal. The injury, along with his high brow and perfect diction, gave Macready the Gothic look of an authoritarian or villainous character.\n\nMacready first worked in a bank in Providence and was then briefly a newspaperman in New York City before he turned to stage acting. He claimed to have been descended from the 19th century Shakespearean actor William Macready.\n\nMacready made his Broadway debut in a 1926 stage adaptation of \"The Scarlet Letter\". Through 1958, he appeared in fifteen plays, both drama and comedy, including \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", based on the family of the English poetess, Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\nMacready's penchant for acting was spurred in part by the director Richard Boleslawski. His Shakespearean stage credits included Benedick in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (1927), Malcolm in \"Macbeth\" (1928) and Paris in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1934). On film, he played Marallus in the 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\". He also portrayed Prince Ernst in the original stage version of \"Victoria Regina\" (1936), starring Helen Hayes.\n\nMacready's first film was \"Commandos Strike at Dawn\" (1942), which starred Paul Muni. In \"Gilda\" (1946), Macready's character Ballin Mundson enters a deadly love triangle with characters played by co-stars with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. He would again play opposite Ford several years later in the post-war adventure \"The Green Glove\" (1952).\n\nStanley Kubrick's anti-war film \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) provided Macready with his other great role, self-serving French World War I general Paul Mireau, who is brought down by Kirk Douglas's character, Colonel Dax. He had worked with Douglas previously in \"Detective Story\" (1951), and later he appeared with Douglas in two more films: Vincente Minnelli's \"Two Weeks in Another Town\" (1962) and John Frankenheimer's \"Seven Days in May\" (1964). In 1965, he was cast in a rare comedy role as General Kuhster in Blake Edwards's film \"The Great Race\".\n\nOne of Macready's last film roles was as United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull in \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" (1970), a depiction of the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nMacready made four guest appearances on Raymond Burr's \"Perry Mason\", including the role of murder victim Milo Girard in the 1958 episode \"The Case of the Purple Woman.\" He was also cast regularly in such series as \"Four Star Playhouse\", \"General Electric Theater\", \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Adventures in Paradise\" and \"The Islanders\".\n\nMacready appeared in many western television series produced in the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Bat Masterson\", \"Bonanza\", \"The Dakotas\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Have Gun - Will Travel\", \"The Rebel\" (once in the role of Confederate General Robert E. Lee), \"The Rifleman\", \"Lancer\", \"Riverboat\", \"The Rough Riders\", Chill Wills's \"Frontier Circus\", \"The Texan\" and Steve McQueen's \"\". Also on TV, he was seen in episodes of \"The Outer Limits\", Boris Karloff's \"Thriller\", \"Get Smart\" with Don Adams and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" with Robert Vaughn.\n\nMacready also portrayed Colonel John Barrington in the 1961 episode \"Handful of Fire\" of the NBC Western series \"Laramie\".\n\nMacready was cast as Cyrus Canfield, a vengeful father searching for his runaway teenaged daughter, played by Floy Dean, in the May 26, 1962, series finale of NBC's \"The Tall Man\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Macready performed for three years in the role of Martin Peyton in ABC's \"Peyton Place\", the first prime-time soap opera on American television, with Dorothy Malone in the lead role of Constance MacKenzie. \n\nHe played publishing magnate Glenn Howard in the TV movie \"Fame Is the Name of the Game\" (1966) starring Anthony Franciosa, but was replaced by Gene Barry in the role when the film was subsequently used as the pilot for the television series \"The Name of the Game\" with Franciosa, Barry, and Robert Stack revolving in the lead.\n\nAn art collector, Macready was a partner with colleague Vincent Price in a Beverly Hills art gallery called The Little Gallery, which they opened in 1943. (Macready had played Price's brother on Broadway in \"Victoria Regina\".) According to Lucy Chase Williams' book \"The Complete Films of Vincent Price\", \"The establishment merited photos and two full columns in \"Newsweek\" magazine, but rent increases forced The Little Gallery to close after two years.\" \n\nMacready married actress Elizabeth Dana Patterson. He was the father of actor/producer Michael Macready, Marcia Macready and Elizabeth Dana Macready. He is the grandfather of gymnast John Macready and 3 other grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren.\n\nMacready died of emphysema in 1973 and his body was donated to the UCLA School of Medicine.\n\n\nPeyton Place (1962-1965) as Martin Peyton\n\n"}
{"id": "2083304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083304", "title": "The Steiner Brothers", "text": "The Steiner Brothers\n\nThe Steiner Brothers are the professional wrestling tag team of American brothers Robert \"Rick Steiner\" Rechsteiner and Scott \"Scott Steiner\" Rechsteiner.\n\nThe brothers wrestled as amateurs at the University of Michigan. The team debuted in 1989, and competed in promotions such as Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), winning in the process eleven world tag team championships and one United States Tag Team Championship, before disbanding in 1998.\n\nThe brothers reunited on the independent circuit in the early 2000s, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in May 2007. They are the first tag team to hold the WWF World Tag Team Championship, the WCW World Tag Team Championship, and the IWGP Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe Steiner Brothers are highly regarded as one of the greatest tag teams of all time in professional wrestling.\n\nAt Starrcade '88 and Chi-Town Rumble, Scott Steiner started to accompany his brother Rick in his matches. Not long after, the brothers started to team up in January 1989.\n\nWith Missy Hyatt in their corner, the Steiner Brothers were an up-and-coming tag team, mixing technique, power, speed, and agility. They later added Robin Green to the group. With their tremendous win-loss record, they earned a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship, held by The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin). On September 12, 1989, at \"Clash of the Champions VIII\", the Steiners lost when Green tripped Scott, causing him to get DDT'd and pinned by Hayes. Green would transform into Woman, and brought a tag team called Doom to wrestle the Steiners at Halloween Havoc, in which the Steiners lost.\n\nOn November 1, 1989, in Atlanta, Georgia, the Steiners defeated the Freebirds for the NWA World Tag Team titles; the title change would air on the November 18 episode of \"World Championship Wrestling\". They held the titles until May 19, 1990, when they were defeated by Doom in Washington, D.C. at Capital Combat.\n\nThe Steiners defeated The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on August 24, 1990 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. During their title reign, World Championship Wrestling rebranded the championships they owned and controlled, and the title was renamed the WCW United States Tag Team Championship. Upon winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship on February 18, 1991 (the title change aired on the March 9 episode of WCW Pro Wrestling), the Steiners vacated the WCW United States Tag Team Championship on February 20, 1991. They were the second team ever to hold both the WCW World and United States Tag Team titles at once (The Midnight Express tandem of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane were the first team to accomplish that feat in September 1988). After the Steiners won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki on March 21, 1991, WCW announcers began referring to them as \"Triple Crown Champions\".\n\nAt the same time, Scott was being groomed as a singles performer. On WCW's weekend TBS shows (\"WCW Power Hour\", \"WCW Saturday Night\", and \"WCW Main Event\"). There was a special \"gauntlet\" match segment where a performer was picked to wrestle a top star on each show on that weekend, winning the sum of $15,000 USD (kayfabe) if they defeated all three. Scott was the second to run the gauntlet, with his second opponent being Ric Flair. Because the Four Horsemen clumsily interfered, Steiner beat Flair by pinfall. He would then get a title match against Flair at \"\" on January 30, 1991, which ended in a time limit draw. and began teasing a heel turn when he teamed with Marcus Bagwell against Steve Austin and Brian Pillman on an Oct 10th, 1992 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\". During the match Bagwell was injured when he was attacked Arn Anderson and when Scott went to tag Bagwell he was unable to. An angry Scott then kicked Bagwell and slammed him into the ring where he was attacked by Austin and Pillman who then won the match. Scott would go on to win the WCW World Television Championship from Ricky Steamboat on October 17, 1992. The heel turn which Scott was undergoing was later aborted upon the Steiner Brothers leaving WCW for the World Wrestling Federation after being lowballed on their contract renewal by then-WCW head Bill Watts.\n\nThe Steiners left WCW in November 1992, with Scott vacating the WCW World Television Championship. They quickly signed contracts with the World Wrestling Federation, making their televised debut as babyfaces in an interview on the December 21, 1992, edition of \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\". During their WWF run, emphasis would be placed on their accomplishments at the University of Michigan, including using Michigan's fight song \"The Victors\" as their entrance music and wearing Michigan-themed ring attire. They appeared on the debut episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" on January 11, 1993. They made their WWF pay-per-view debut on January 24, 1993 at the 1993 Royal Rumble, defeating The Beverly Brothers (Blake and Beau). At WrestleMania IX on April 4, 1993, the Steiner Brothers defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu).\n\nFollowing WrestleMania IX, the Steiners began feuding with Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). At King of the Ring 1993 on June 13, 1993, the Steiners and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) defeated The Headshrinkers and Money, Inc. The following evening, at the June 14, 1993 television taping, the Steiners defeated Money, Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship in Columbus, Ohio. (The Steiners were still babyfaces in the match despite Columbus being home to Michigan's archrival, Ohio State.) Money, Inc. regained the titles on June 16, 1993 at a house show in Rockford, Illinois, but lost the titles to the Steiners once again at another house show on June 19, 1993 in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe Steiners successfully defended their titles against The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) on August 30, 1993 at SummerSlam 1993. On the September 13, 1993 episode of \"Raw\" in New York City, New York, the Steiners defended their titles against The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre) in a \"Province of Quebec rules\" match, wherein titles can change hands via disqualification. The match ended when the manager of The Quebecers, Johnny Polo, threw a hockey stick into the ring, which was about to be used by Jacques, however, Scott took it away and began to hit him with it as the referee turned around, thus, he disqualified the Steiner Brothers, awarding the title to The Quebecers. Scott gained a measure of revenge by defeating Pierre in a singles match the following week on \"Raw\".\n\nAt the 1993 Survivor Series on November 24, 1993, the Steiners teamed with Lex Luger and The Undertaker as \"The All-Americans\". The All-Americans defeated their opponents, \"The Foreign Fanatics\" (Yokozuna, Crush, Ludvig Borga and Jacques), although Luger was the sole survivor.\n\nOn January 22, 1994, both Steiners entered the 1994 Royal Rumble, with Scott entering at number one. After Rick entered at number three, the brothers cooperated until being eliminated by Owen Hart and Diesel respectively. The Steiners wrestled sparingly after that and eventually left the promotion in mid 1994. Scott appeared last in a King of the Ring qualifier loss to Irwin R. Schyster at the April 13 \"Superstars of Wrestling\" taping (which included a run-in from Rick after the match), which aired on May 7. Scott would return to the company in late 2002.\n\nThe Steiners debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on July 28, 1995 in the Orange County Fairgrounds in Middletown, New York, defeating Dudley Dudley and Vampire Warrior. They next appeared with ECW in The Flagstaff on August 4, 1995 in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, defeating Dudley Dudley and 2 Cold Scorpio. The Steiner Brothers made their debut in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, ECW Arena on August 5, 1995 at \"WrestlePalooza 1995\", teaming with Eddie Guerrero in a loss to Scorpio, Dean Malenko and Cactus Jack. On August 25, 1995 in Jim Thorpe they defeated Scorpio and Malenko, and they went on to defeat Scorpio and Chris Benoit the following evening. On August 28, 1995, they defeated Dudley Dudley and Dances with Dudley in the Big Apple Dinner Theater in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt Gangstas' Paradise on September 16, 1995, the Steiners joined forces with Tazz in a loss to The Eliminators (John Kronus and Perry Saturn) and Jason. On September 23, 1995 in Middletown, they defeated Raven and Stevie Richards. Scott made one more appearance (teaming with Taz in a losing effort against The Eliminators on October 28, 1995) before the brothers departed from ECW.\n\nThe Steiners re-signed with WCW in 1996. They initially feuded with the Road Warriors and had several matches with then champions Sting and Lex Luger. They would eventually win the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat on July 24, 1996, but Harlem Heat would regain the title just three days later and the title changes were never mentioned on TV. A short time later, Scott was sidelined with an injury and Rick had several singles matches until Scott returned to the ring the following January. Following the formation of the New World Order (nWo), the Steiners began feuding with The Outsiders, who had won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat. The Steiners spent the entirety of 1997 and into 1998 feuding with the duo of Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. They also feuded with other nWo members like Vicious and Delicious and continued to have matches with Harlem Heat.\n\nThe beginning of Scott's heel turn began in late 1997/early 1998 when he, now with increased muscle mass, having cut his signature mullet, and sporting a goatee, started a feud with Buff Bagwell over who had the better physique, as well as developing a short fuse with his temper. Scott and Rick began having problems teaming up, as Scott would often not tag his brother into matches. The team entered 1998 as the tag team champions, but the dissention caused them to lose the belts. It was not the end of the team's troubles, as Scott would often wrestle a whole match by himself, refuse to tag Rick when he would need to leave the ring, and would often keep the referee distracted with his own antics. On the February 2, 1998 edition of \"Nitro\", things appeared to come to a head when Scott scored the victory in a tag team match against Nash and Bagwell by pinning Bagwell without making a tag to Rick, and Rick screamed and yelled at his brother for his actions. One week later, however, the duo won the WCW World Tag Team Championship again.\n\nThe final straw came at SuperBrawl VIII on February 22, 1998 when the brothers would face The Outsiders again. Midway through the match, Rick knocked both Hall and Nash out of the ring while both attempted to attack him behind the referee's back and celebrated by running around the ring barking while Scott entered the ring to celebrate with him. Scott then attacked Rick by hitting him in the back, followed by a double underhook powerbomb. Scott then abandoned his brother to be taken out by Hall and Nash and signified that he was joining the nWo by personally handing Hall and Nash the championship belts himself. The next night on \"Monday Nitro\", he adopted a new gimmick that was somewhat reminiscent of Superstar Billy Graham, dyeing his hair and goatee blond and increasing in muscle mass even further, damaging his agility.\n\nThe two brothers had a feud that also involved Scott's new partner Buff Bagwell, while Rick teamed with a variety of partners including Kenny Kaos, Lex Luger and Bagwell's mother Judy. Shortly before WCW's demise, the Steiners reunited on August 7, 2000 not so much as a tag team but they were both heels who watched each other's backs. They lost to Kevin Nash and Sting on Monday Night Nitro. On March 5, 2001 they reunited for their last WCW match as a tag team as they lost to Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page on Monday Night Nitro.\n\nWhen WCW closed in March 2001, the two went their separate ways again. Rick would go to wrestle for New Japan Pro Wrestling, World Wrestling All-Stars in 2002, and Total Non-Stop Action in 2003. Later on he went to Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan between 2004 and 2005. Scott would go to World Wrestling All-Stars in late 2001 and then returned to World Wrestling Entertainment in November 2002. He was released from WWE in August 2004 and then went to the independent circuit and New Wrestling Entertainment in Italy in 2005.\n\nThe brothers reunited for the first time since the closing of WCW. They wrestled for New Japan Pro Wrestling as Rick was working full time on the roster. They only wrestled three matches. In May 2002 they defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kensuke Sasaki which the match was refereed by Chyna. On July 19, 2002, they lost to Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono. Then the next day they defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenzo Suzuki.\n\nThe brothers reunited for the Wrestling Fan Xperince in Winnipeg, Manitoba to defeat Buff Bagwell and G-Man on December 6, 2005. On June 2, 2006, Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) defeated Elvis Elliot & Original Sinn at a UCW wrestling show at Bay City Western High School in Auburn, Michigan entitled \"Steiner Brothers Return Home.\" They went to United Wrestling Federation in Wilson, North Carolina to defeat the team of Matt Bentley and Frankie Kazarian. They also defeated Team 3D the next night in Wilmington, North Carolina. On December 9, 2006, the Steiners won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship.On January 4, 2008 they returned to New Japan as they lost to the IWGP Tag Team Champions Giant Bernard and Travis Tomko in Tokyo. Then they defeated Bobby Eaton and Ricky Morton at MCW Mayday 2009 in Toccoa, Georgia. On December 13, 2009 they defeated Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm) and (Robert Roode) at PTM Supermacy in Belleville, Michigan. Afterwards the brothers went their separate ways once gain. Rick continued in the independent circuit and mainly wreslted in the Mid-Atlantic area. Scott returned to the indies as well. Also he worked in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. \n\nAt the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view Sacrifice 2007, Scott Steiner teamed with Tomko in a Triple Threat Tag Team match. They lost the match and the miscommunication between Steiner and Tomko led Tomko to attack Steiner following the match. Rick Steiner made his return and fought off Tomko, thus reuniting the Steiner Brothers. They were set to face Team 3D at Slammiversary 2007 for their World Tag Team Championship. An injury to Scott's trachea in Puerto Rico, however, put the match in question, until he was replaced by longtime rival Road Warrior Animal. While Scott was out for his injury, Team 3D demanded his return and teased his near-death injury. The duo then appeared and attacked Team 3D at Victory Road, costing them their World Tag Team titles. At Hard Justice, the Steiner Brothers defeated Team 3D. On the August 16 episode of \"Impact!\", the Steiner brothers lost in a Handicap match to Kurt Angle after interference from Team 3D, heating up their feud. At Bound for Glory the Steiner brothers defeated Team 3D in a two out of three falls tables match. The following month at Genesis, the Steiners received a tag team title shot against A.J. Styles and Tomko, but were unsuccessful. On January 29, 2008 however, Rick was released from TNA, breaking up the Steiners once again. Scott left TNA in February 2010 and returned in February 2011. He was released by TNA in March 2012.\n\nBefore Scott's release from TNA, he reunited with Rick as they lost to The New Age Outlaws (B.G.

He was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Surrey-Cloverdale as a member of the BC Liberals from 2001 to 2013. He served as both the Deputy Premier, and the province's Minister of Finance.\n\nBorn in North Vancouver, Falcon worked in insurance after graduating from a private Catholic high school Vancouver College. Falcon holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simon Fraser University (SFU). He lives in Surrey, British Columbia with his wife Jessica and daughters Josephine and Rose.\n\nAfter being involved with the Social Credit (Socred) party in the 1980s, Falcon decided to study political science at SFU. He was a member of the Young Socreds on campus while future Premier Christy Clark was also at SFU.\n\nAfter graduation, he was part of a movement to revitalize the right-wing municipal party in Surrey that saw Doug McCallum upset Bob Bose, the NDP incumbent mayor, in 1996 and the election to council of future mayor Dianne Watts.\n\nFalcon then set up a communications consultancy (Access Group) in 1998. His major step into provincial politics was as a lead organizer of the \"Total Recall\" effort to recall a number of BC New Democratic Party MLA's in 1999.\n\nAfter replacing incumbent Bonnie McKinnon as the Liberal nominee, he was first elected in 2001 as a BC Liberal to represent the riding of Surrey-Cloverdale, and re-elected in the 2005, and 2009 elections.\n\nHis first cabinet appointment was in the newly created position of Minister of State for Deregulation which earned kudos from business and industry for cutting government 'red tape.' In January 2009, after police \"raided\" the legislature to investigate corruption in the sale of BC Rail, Falcon replaced Judith Reid as Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure.\n\nAs transport minister, Falcon changed the governance structure of TransLink to reduce the oversight by municipal representatives. He also introduced the Gateway Program, a $3 billion regional transportation strategy for Metro Vancouver that launched the construction of the new Port Mann Bridge.\n\nIn June 2009, Falcon was appointed as Minister of Health. He approved expansion of Surrey Memorial Hospital, pursued new models of shared-services and province-wide purchasing between health authorities, and launched a provincial agency to begin P4P (Pay For Performance funding models.\n\nOnce Falcon was promoted to Minister of Health, he proposed changes to the health regulations regarding sales of contact lenses and eyeglasses which removed the requirement of a physical inspection of a prescription allowing their sale over the internet, to be effective May 2010.\n\nObjections from professional health care associations included concerns that allowing opticians to perform sight tests would result in patients receiving less frequent comprehensive eye exams, and that allowing retailers to dispense eyeglasses and contact lenses without verifying a prescription may result in improperly fitted prescriptions or harmful health effects. Political opponents argued that Falcon made these proposals after a $10,000 donation from Clearly Contacts to the BC Liberal Party, and after an email from Clearly Contacts was sent out to eligible voters urging them to join the BC Liberal Party and vote for Falcon as leader.\n\nOn November 3, 2010, Premier Gordon Campbell announced that he would step down as Premier of British Columbia once his successor was chosen. On November 30, 2010, Falcon launched his campaign to be the leader of the BC Liberal Party, and subsequently the Premier of British Columbia.\n\nFalcon is regarded as one of the more conservative members of caucus and was able to secure a large number of supporters from the British Columbia business community. He was also supported by 19 BC Liberal caucus members, one former caucus member and Liberal Party Senator Larry Campbell.\n\nOn December 11, the \"Vancouver Sun\" reported that Falcon's social media traffic was the highest of declared candidates. Throughout the campaign he refused to call for a full public inquiry into the sale of BC Rail and associated scandal, which involved allegations of bribes paid to Liberal insiders. However, he agreed to an investigation into why the government paid $6 million in legal fees for Liberal party aides Robert Virk and David Basi after they pleaded guilty to accepting bribes.\n\nOn February 26, 2011, Falcon lost his bid to become the Liberal leader, and the province's Premier, to Christy Clark by a margin of 52%-48% in the third round of voting by party members.\n\nIn 2012, a number of Falcon supporters 'fled' to the BC Conservative party, including former BC Liberal nomination candidate Rick Peterson. Falcon remarked that \"a number of my supporters that may have done that and I’m not entirely surprised\".\n\nChristy Clark, the new Premier, included her main challenger in cabinet by appointing him to the key but also challenging position of Minister of Finance, whose portfolio included rescinding the controversial Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). In August 2012, Falcon stepped down from cabinet and announced he would not run in the 2013 election during the same period where George Abbott (politician) and a number of other Campbell MLAs were dropping out.\n\nFalcon returned to the real-estate investment industry as executive vice-president for Anthem Capital. He was also named as an honorary director by the Surrey Board of Trade.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2083322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083322", "title": "Frybread", "text": "Frybread\n\nFrybread (also spelled fry bread) is a flat dough bread, fried or deep-fried in oil, shortening, or lard. Made with simple ingredients, frybread can be eaten alone or with various toppings such as honey, jam, powdered sugar, venison, or beef. Frybread can also be made into tacos, like Navajo tacos.\nAccording to Navajo tradition, frybread was created in 1864 using the flour, sugar, salt and lard that was given to them by the United States government when the Navajo, who were living in Arizona, were forced to make the 300-mile journey known as the \"Long Walk\" and relocate to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico, onto land that could not easily support their traditional staples of vegetables and beans, New Mexican cuisine style sopapillas also share this origin due to Pueblos and Hispanos of New Mexico having a similar subsistence at this time. Boarding schools also helped to spread frybread in Native American diets.\n\nFor many Native Americans, \"frybread links generation with generation and also connects the present to the painful narrative of Native American history\". It is often served both at home and at gatherings. The way it is served varies from region to region and different tribes have different recipes. It can be found in its many ways at state fairs and pow-wows, but what is served to the paying public may be different from what is served in private homes and in the context of tribal family relations.\n\nFrybread's significance to Native Americans has been described as complicated and their relationship with it conflicted. Although frybread is often associated with \"traditional\" Native American cuisine, some Native American chefs reject it as a symbol of colonialism. Indigenous chef Sean Sherman calls it \"everything that isn't Native American food\", writing that it represents \"perseverance and pain, ingenuity and resilience\". Frybread became a symbol of resilience as it was developed out of necessity using government-provided flour, sugar, and lard. However, indigenous chefs such as Sherman consider it a symbol of colonial oppression, as the ingredients were being provided because the government had moved the people onto land that could not support growing traditional staples like corn and beans. The journalist and documentary filmmaker Patty Talahongva, who identifies as Hopi of the Corn Clan, calls frybread \"Die Bread\" and associates it with diseases endemic to Native Americans, including gallbladder disease, diabetes, and more. She attributes the spread of frybread to boarding schools, like the Phoenix Indian School, which she attended in the late 1970s. She also describes the movement towards indigenous food sovereignty – which promotes healthy foods like corn, beans, and squash, instead of starchy, high-fat foods like frybread – while citing the importance to this effort of Roxanne Swentzell (Santa Clara Pueblo); Winona LaDuke (Ojibwe); Nephi Craig (Apache and Navajo); Loretta Barrett Oden; Sean Sherman (Oglala Lakota); Brian Yazzie (Navajo); and the culinary ethnobotanist Tashia Hart.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that a plate of fry bread consists of 700 Calories and 27 grams of fat.\n\nA typical frybread recipe consists of flour, water, salt, a small amount of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, until the dough rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed early in the morning and left in a large bowl covered with a cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is approximately 6 miles southeast of downtown Biddeford, to which it is connected via State Route 208. The town of Kennebunkport is 3 miles southwest, connected via State Route 9.\n\nBiddeford Pool is the site of Maine's first recorded permanent settlement, then called Winter Harbor (not to be confused with present-day Winter Harbor, Maine). In the winter of 1616-1617, Richard Vines, a physician, resided here as part of the colonization efforts of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, lord proprietor of Maine. An early village developed on the north side. In 1688, Fort Mary was built near the pool's entrance. \n\nThe former Fletcher's Neck Lifesaving Station, closed in 1971 and on the National Register of Historic Places, still stands at Ocean Avenue and Fourth Street.\n\nDuring World War II the Biddeford Pool Military Reservation was established from 1941 to 1945, on what is now the Abenakee Golf Club. It had four circular concrete platforms called \"Panama mounts\" for 155 mm guns, three of which remain today. From December 1941 to 12 February 1943 it was garrisoned by Battery F of the 240th Coast Artillery of the Maine National Guard; this unit was then relieved by Battery E of the 22nd Coast Artillery, which departed in October 1943; it is unclear what unit was at the site after that time.\n\nThe small harbor hosts both vacationers and lobstermen. Its water level fluctuates from a large navigable body during high tide to mostly mudflats during low tide. The only exception is the deep mouth, where a gut is located which is naturally dredged by tidal current. It is locally known as \"The Gut.\" Consequently, this is the area where most boats are moored. Wood Island Light is located about a mile offshore to the northeast. \n\nBiddeford Pool is bounded by the mainland to the south and west, by Hills Beach to the north, and by East Point to the east. The area is a popular summer destination for visitors from as far south as Florida and as far west as California. The pool is surrounded by tall grass salt marshes that are home to a variety of birds and other wildlife. East Point Sanctuary, maintained by the Maine Audubon Society, is considered to be one of the premier birding spots on the northeast coast. Mile Stretch Road, a sandy strip of beach which connects the neighborhood of Biddeford Pool to the mainland, is a notable tombolo.\n\nPoints of interest around Biddeford Pool include the Biddeford coastal neighborhoods of Hills Beach, Fortune's Rocks, and Granite Point; and the Kennebunkport coastal area of Goose Rocks.\n\n"}

He was selected with the eighth pick of the second round of the 2000 NFL Draft out of the University of Nebraska by the Chicago Bears. Brown was ranked #49 in ESPN Chicago's \"50 Greatest Bears\" poll in 2012.\n\nMike Brown graduated from Saguaro High School in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1996, where he played both football and baseball.\n\nIn football, he was an All-State choice and ranked the top defensive back prospect in the country by SuperPrep, and named Arizona Player-of-the-Year by every major publication. Mike Brown was named the state's top running back and defensive back by \"The Arizona Republic\", which was the first time in 10 years a player received both awards. Mike rushed for 2,036 yards (9.6 avg.) and 31 touchdowns as a senior.\n\nIn baseball, he played center field and was an All-State choice as a senior, after batting .426, and posting 27 stolen bases.\n\nBrown enjoyed a stellar college career and is still considered by many fans and experts of Nebraska football to be the greatest strong safety in the modern history of the school. Brown played cornerback as a freshman before playing both safety positions in his final three seasons. As a junior, he set Nebraska single-season record for tackles by a defensive back with a career-high 102 and was named to all-Big 12 first-team. Brown enjoyed his greatest season as senior in which he was first-team all-America selection by Associated Press and Football Writers Association and a unanimous all-Big Twelve first-team pick and academic all-American. He started every game and finished the year leading the Huskers with 96 tackles while adding two sacks, one fumble recovery, six forced fumbles and five interceptions, five passes defended.\n\nThe Chicago Bears drafted Brown as 39th overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. Brown was the only rookie to play in the 2000 season’s opener, eventually becoming the team’s starting free safety for all sixteen games of the season. He recorded the second most tackles on the team that year and one interception that was returned for a touchdown. He received accolades from \"Pro Football Weekly\", \"Football News\" and \"Football Digest\", but lost the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award to teammate Brian Urlacher. The following year, he had two memorable performances, during which he returned two interceptions for two consecutive overtime wins, making him the first player in league history to accomplish the feat. The 2001 Bears finished the season with a 13–3 record and one of the league’s most prominent defenses. Brown recorded a team leading five interceptions including 2 in overtime that were returned for touchdowns that year. However, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the team in the postseason’s second round.\n\nBrown recorded three interceptions and 111 tackles in 2002, despite sustaining a hand injury during the off season. One of his most notable performances came when he returned a fumble for a 68-yard touchdown, following a fumble and lateral pass from Rosevelt Colvin. In addition to the return he had forced three fumbles that season. However, Brown only intercepted two passes during the 2003 season, and tied for third among tackles on the team.\n\nAfter sustaining an Achilles injury in 2004, which forced him to miss the last 14 games, and a calf-injury in 2005 which made him miss the last four games of 2005, the Bears defense was noticeably less effective. Brown tried to play in a January 2006 Divisional Playoff game for the Bears against the Carolina Panthers, but had to leave the game in the first quarter. The Panthers would go on to win the game, 29–21. During week six of the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Brown suffered a Lisfranc fracture. The ailment forced him to undergo surgery, and sent him to Bears' injured reserve for the remainder of the season.\n\nBrown is also noted by teammates and coaches for his on-field coaching ability. He made the NFL transitions much easier for his fellow safeties Chris Harris and Danieal Manning by making sure they were in the correct positions. Brian Urlacher often referred to him as the actual leader of the defense. Brown returned to the field during the 2007 season's mini-camp, making a recovery much earlier than expected. Brown recorded an interception during the 2007 season's opener against the San Diego Chargers. However, he sustained a knee injury after Lorenzo Neal horse-collar tackled him. Brown returned to the locker room, and emotionally stated that something in his knee did not feel right. Further medical examination confirmed that Brown would miss the remainder of the season.\n\nNeal, who knew he was at fault immediately after the play, apologized to Brown and the media. Brian Urlacher, one of Brown’s longtime teammates and friends, stated he was unsure whether Brown would attempt another comeback.\n\nThe Bears reached an agreement with Brown on a restructured contract on May 20, 2008. The restructured deal would protect Chicago if Brown got hurt for the fourth time in his career. He would still collect his annual $2.44 million, but only $950,000 of it would be guaranteed for being on the Week 1 roster. The rest of the payout would have been based on playing time. If Brown got injured in preseason, he would only receive $320,000. Brown sustained a calf injury during the Bears' second-to-last game of the 2008 season, and was subsequently placed on the injury reserve. Brown was just one game away from completing his first full season in more than four years.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, the Chicago Bears announced that they would not offer a contract to Mike Brown. He then signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on June 24. Brown started in all 16 games for the Chiefs, recording three interceptions and 79 tackles.\n\nKey\n"}
{"id": "2083330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083330", "title": "Money Inc.", "text": "Money Inc.\n\nMoney Inc. was a professional wrestling tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from February 1992 to August 1993. The team consisted of \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.). They held the WWF Tag Team Championship three times, defeating the Legion of Doom, the Natural Disasters and the Steiner Brothers for the title. In addition they had a feud with the Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). After Money Inc. split up, DiBiase and Schyster were reunited in two stables, the Million Dollar Corporation and the New World Order, and have made several television appearances during special episodes of \"Raw\".\n\nBoth DiBiase and Schyster had gimmicks that focused on money. Schyster, whose initials spelled I.R.S., portrayed an evil tax accountant. DiBiase had used the gimmick of an arrogant millionaire in the WWF since 1987. He called himself the \"Million Dollar Man\" and created his own championship belt, the Million Dollar Championship. He was involved in angles that included purchasing the WWF Championship, purchasing actual people such as Nikolai Volkoff and Sapphire Sapphire began appearing in segments where she would do favors for DiBiase, including ironing his money. She left the WWF a short time later., and paying wrestlers and fans to perform demeaning tasks. The WWF creative team decided that the two characters fit well together and made the decision to pair them together in late 1991. In February 1992, a storyline began in which Jimmy Hart, who had been managing The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon), turned against his team. In return for a bribe, he gave his team's contract for a WWF Tag Team Championship match against Legion of Doom (LOD) to Money Inc.\n\nDiBiase and Schyster, managed by Hart, defeated LOD at a house show on February 7, 1992 in Denver, Colorado, to win the title. This title win was unusual for professional wrestling, as Money Inc. had not yet debuted as a team on WWF television programming. In addition, the decision to give the championship belts to Money Inc. was made in a hurry, as LOD's Hawk had failed a drug test. The wrestlers were unaware until that night that the title would change hands, and Money Inc.'s win was not immediately acknowledged on television, as WWF programming was taped in advance. The Natural Disasters, upset by Hart's assistance to a rival tag team, fired Hart as their manager and turned face, beginning a feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship.\n\nNot wanting to carry two championship belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive that he would no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the next few months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title.\n\nAfter Hawk's suspension ended, the Legion of Doom was given a rematch against Money Inc. at SummerSlam 1992. The match was promoted as a championship bout, but the Natural Disasters beat Money Inc. for the title a month before the pay-per-view. At SummerSlam on August 29, the Legion of Doom won the match when Animal pinned DiBiase.\n\nAt the October 13, 1992 \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural Disasters in a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match originally pitted the Disasters against the Nasty Boys, who were also managed by Hart, but at the last minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, the Nasty Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, the Nasty Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced the Nasty Boys and the Natural Disasters in an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural Disasters, but Jerry Sags of the Nasty Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match. This was the only major victory The Nasty Boys got over Money Inc., as they failed to win the tag team title in several shots on television and at house shows in late 1992 into early 1993.\n\nOn the February 15, 1993 airing of \"Monday Night Raw\", Ted DiBiase wrestled against Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake. Beefcake had sustained a real-life injury to his face in 1990. While Beefcake was wrestling his first match in two and a half years, DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart repeatedly got in the way before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. I.R.S. then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase. Hart justified his face turn by claiming that he felt the need to \"step up and do the right thing\" and that he \"had a change of heart\".\n\nShortly thereafter, Hulk Hogan made his return to WWF television, and he teamed with Beefcake to form The Mega-Maniacs with Hart as their manager. Hogan and Beefcake challenged Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania IX. During the match, the referee sustained a kayfabe injury and was knocked unconscious. Hart jumped into the ring, turned his jacket inside-out to reveal black and white stripes similar to a referee's shirt, and made the three-count to give the match to The Mega-Maniacs. Hogan, Beefcake, and Hart celebrated by opening Schyster's briefcase and throwing his money into the crowd. A second referee then appeared, and the Mega-Maniacs were disqualified because Hogan had used Beefcake's steel face protector as a weapon.\n\nMoney Inc. feuded with The Steiner Brothers in the spring of 1993. At the 1993 King of the Ring, The Steiner Brothers and The Smokin' Gunns defeated Money Inc. and The Headshrinkers in an 8-man tag team match. The following day, June 14, 1993, the Steiners defeated Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Two days later, Money Inc. regained the titles, only to drop them back to the Steiners three days later. Although Money Inc. received several rematches, they were unable to win the belts back from the Steiners.\n\nAfter failing to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an embarrassing loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on a leave of absence for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon. DiBiase retired from wrestling.\n\nMike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase continue to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster was one of the first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as members of the New World Order.\n\nMoney Inc. made a surprise one-night return at Raw Family Reunion on October 9, 2006. They joined Arn Anderson and Rowdy Roddy Piper to assist Ric Flair, who was facing Mitch. They prevented the rest of Mitch's Spirit Squad from getting involved in the match, helping Flair secure the victory.\n\nAt the 15th Anniversary special edition of \"Monday Night Raw\" on December 10, 2007, Money Inc. had a brief reunion during a 15-man over-the-top-rope battle royal. After I.R.S. was the last man standing out of the 14 wrestlers that made it to the ring, DiBiase came out as the 15th entrant and paid I.R.S. to eliminate himself. As a result, DiBiase was named the winner of the match. They were also reunited on an episode of RAW in 2010 where they fought with fellow legends after a match between DiBiase's son Ted DiBiase and Christian.\n\n\n\n"}

Salmon (; né Nathan Salmon Ucuzoglu on January 2, 1951) is an American philosopher in the analytic tradition, specializing in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of logic.\n\nSalmon was born January 2, 1951 in Los Angeles to a working-class family of Sephardi Jews of Spanish-Turkish heritage. He is the grandson of archivist Emily Sene (née Emily Perez) and oud player Isaac Sene. Salmon attended Lincoln Elementary School in Torrance, California through eighth grade, where he was a classmate and friend of the child prodigy, James Newton Howard. Salmon graduated from North High School (Torrance) in 1969.\nThe first person in his family to go to college, Salmon graduated from El Camino College (1971) and from the University of California, Los Angeles (B.A. 1973, M.A. 1974, Ph.D. 1979). At UCLA he studied with Tyler Burge, Alonzo Church, Keith Donnellan, Donald Kalish, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, and Yiannis Moschovakis. Salmon was assistant professor of philosophy at Princeton University from 1978 to 1982. In 1984, the Council of Graduate Schools awarded him the Gustave O. Arlt Award in the Humanities, for his book, \"Reference and Essence\" (1981), which was based on his UCLA doctoral dissertation. His second book, \"Frege's Puzzle\" (1986), was selected by Scott Soames for a literary website as one of the best five books on the philosophy of language.\n\nSalmon is currently Distinguished Professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has been teaching there since 1984. He has also taught at UCLA, the University of California, Riverside, the University of Southern California, and was a regular visiting distinguished professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 2009 to 2012.\n\nSalmon is a proponent of the theory of direct reference. Salmon has provided accounts both of propositional attitudes and of Frege's puzzle about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form \"\"a\" = \"b\"\". Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of semantic content. Thus, on his view the sentence \"Samuel Clemens was witty\" expresses exactly the same content as \"Mark Twain was witty\", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that Mark Twain was witty \"ipso facto\" believes that Samuel Clemens was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some \"proposition-guise\" or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called \"de dicto\" belief, and W. V. O. Quine's puzzle about \"de re\" belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.\n\nSalmon provided direct-reference accounts of problems of nonexistence and of names from fiction. Salmon argues, directly contrary to Immanuel Kant, that existence is a property, one that particular individuals have and other individuals lack. According to Salmon, the English verb \"exist\" is (along with its literal translations into other languages), among other things, a term for this alleged property, and a sentence of the form \"\"a\" exists\" is true if and only if the subject term designates something with the property, and is false (and \"\"a\" does not exist\" is true) if and only if the subject term designates something with the complementary property of nonexistence. Thus Russell's example, \"The present king of France exists\", is neither true nor false, since France is not presently a monarchy, and therefore \"the present king of France\" does not designate; whereas \"Napoleon exists\" is simply false, since although Napoleon once existed, the moment he died he took on the property of nonexistence.\n\nBy contrast, Salmon maintains that \"Sherlock Holmes exists\" is literally true, whereas \"Sherlock Holmes was a detective\" is literally false. According to Salmon, Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character, a kind of abstract entity, created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but are literally false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective.\n\nSalmon extends this view to what he calls \"mythical objects\", like the hypothetical planet, Vulcan. Vulcan really exists, but it is not a real planet. It is an abstract entity that is only depicted as a planet in the myth. Salmon's account of fiction and myth thus has direct application to the philosophy of religion. Salmon has also applied his account of mythical objects to Peter Geach's famous problem of uncovering the logical form of the particular sentence, \"Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow\". Salmon's account shows how the problematic sentence can be true even though there are no witches, and even if Hob and Nob do not know about each other, and there is no one whom they think is a witch.\n\nSalmon thinks, again contrary to Kant, that it is perfectly legitimate to invoke existence in a term's definition. Thus \"God\" might be legitimately defined as \"the conceivable individual that is divine and also exists\". According to Salmon, the ontological argument for God's existence fallaciously assumes that \"The \"F\" is \"F\"\" is a truth of logic, or an analytic truth. What is true by logic is a significantly weaker variant: \"If anything is uniquely \"F\", then the \"F\" is \"F\"\". The strongest conclusion that validly follows from the proposed definition is that \"if\" any conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent, \"then\" God actually exists. This same conclusion is also a trivial logical consequence of the atheist's contention that no conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent. According to Salmon's critique, the ontological argument thus shows nothing.\n\nSalmon argues that natural-language sentences that are representable as λ-converts of one another (in the sense of Church's lambda-calculus) are, although logically equivalent by λ-conversion, typically not strictly synonymous, i.e., they typically differ in semantic content—as for example \"\"a\" is large and also \"a\" is seaworthy\" and \"\"a\" is a thing that is both large and seaworthy\".\n\nSalmon maintains a sharp division between semantics and pragmatics (speech acts). He argues that in uttering a sentence, a speaker typically asserts a good deal more than the words' semantic content, and that, consequently, it is a mistake to identify the semantic content of a sentence with what is said by its speaker. Salmon maintains that such an identification is an instance of a mistaken form of argument in the philosophy of language, \"the pragmatic fallacy.\"\n\nSalmon is also known in metaphysics for, among other things, his analysis of arguments for essentialism—the doctrine that some properties of things are properties that those things could not fail to have (except perhaps by not existing). In particular, Salmon is known for his development and defense of a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument, using a sorites-like problem (slippery slope), against nearly universally accepted modal logic systems S4 and S5, which he argues commit \"the fallacy of necessity iteration,\" sanctioning the invalid inference from the observation that a proposition \"p\" is a necessary truth to the conclusion that it is a necessary truth that \"p\" is a necessary truth. He defends his view by exposing a mistake in a standard argument favoring S5, while arguing that there are not only possible worlds—thought of as maximal scenarios that might have obtained—but in addition classically consistent \"impossible worlds\": maximal scenarios that could not obtain.\n\nSalmon also provided a controversial \"reductio ad absurdum\" \"disproof\" of indeterminate identity, i.e., the philosophically popular idea that for some pairs of things there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things are one and the very same. Salmon argues that if there were such a pair of things, \"x\" and \"y\", then this pair would have to be different from the reflexive pair of \"x\" with itself, since there is a fact concerning whether \"x\" and \"x\" are the same. It would then follow by set theory that \"x\" and \"y\" are not the same, and in that case there would be a fact of the matter after all concerning whether \"x\" and \"y\" are the same: they are not. Therefore, there cannot be a pair of things for which there is no fact concerning their identity. On the other hand, Salmon maintains that not all vagueness is due to language and some indeterminacy results from how things themselves are, i.e., that for some things and some attributes, independently of language, there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things have those attributes. Critics of Salmon's alleged proof acknowledge that the highlighted difference between <\"x\", \"y\"> and <\"x\", \"x\">—that there is a fact whether the elements of the latter, but not of the former, are the same thing—is genuine, but respond that it does not validly support the conclusion that those pairs are not the same.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2083368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083368", "title": "Serafim Tulikov", "text": "Serafim Tulikov\n\nSerafim Sergeyevich Tulikov (; July 7, 1914 – January 29, 2004) was a Russian and Soviet composer, who was born in the Imperial Russia, and died in Russia. He was often credited as S. Tulikov in his musical works and his cameo appearance in Russian television series. Serafim Tulikov is known for his patriotic and officially ideological compositions.\n\nSerafim Tulikov was born in Kaluga, western Russia, to the family of bookkeeper Grigoriy Boboedov. Both parents of Serafim were active in choirs during their youth, and Serafim was deeply immersed in music during his childhood. He was eventually enrolled into the Kaluga Academy of Music, and at the age of 18, he studied at many conservatoires in Russia.\n\nDuring the mid-1940s Serafim Tulikov composed a range of melodious lyrical-patriotic songs which became quite popular, for instance, \"The Kursk Nightingale\" (\"Курский соловей\"), with lyrics by Olga Fadeeva. The majority of these songs celebrated the return of peaceful life to war-torn Russia. Tulikov was also heavily influenced by the post-war trend in Soviet popular music towards increasingly archaic and folkloristic imagery and melodic formulas, for instance, in songs such as \"They have come for a sojourn\" (\"Приезжали на побывку\") (lyrics by Yakov Belinsky), \"Moscow the Capital\" (\"Москва-столица\"), and \"Blossom, my Homeland!\" (\"Цвети, наш край\")(lyrics by Sergei Vasiliev).\n\nNational fame came to Tulikov in 1947, when he composed \"We Are for Peace\" (\"Мы - за мир!\"), with lyrics by , a marching song meant to mobilize the masses all over the world on behalf of the USSR-led effort to prevent the escalation of international tensions during the early phase of the Cold War. In 1951, Tulikov composed \"March of the Soviet Youth\" (\"Марш советской молодежи\") (lyrics by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky) which received the First Prize at the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students held in East Berlin. This march continued and developed the pattern established by the composer in \"We Are for Peace!\"; unbridled optimism, mass-mobilizing appeal, and sunny imagery. The initial version of the \"March of the Soviet Youth\" contained the following words: \"Our youth carry love for their Great Leader in their hearts! Stalin is leading us into the future! The path he has chosen for us is the right one!\" After Nikita Khrushchev's \"de-Stalinization\" campaign in 1956, these words were duly replaced.\n\nThroughout most the 1950s, Tulikov continued to compose for all sorts of official ideological occasions, including Communist Party of the Soviet Union congresses, youth festivals, and professional conventions. Tulikov's style of optimism found its expression in such songs as \"This is Us, the Youth!\" (\"Это мы, молодежь\")(lyrics by Lev Oshanin), written on the occasion of the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Warsaw in 1955, \"My Beloved Motherland\" (\"Родина любимая моя\") (lyrics by Andrei Dostal), dedicated to the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution in 1957. With time, Tulikov's style of mass-marching songs had undergone some substantial changes. In the beginning his marches were dynamic and energetic, strongly influenced by the mass songs of Isaak Dunayevsky, but by the late 1950s, Tulikov's marches became more solemn, more static and more hymnal, as in \"My Beloved Motherland\".\n\nIn his more lyrical songs of his early career, Tulikov developed his style of heartfelt and quiet melodies. Such songs include \"My Love, my Life\" (\"Жизнь моя, любовь моя\") (lyrics by Anton Prishelets), \"I Love You, my Sea\" (\"Я люблю тебя, море\") (lyrics by Anatoly Salnikov), \"Above the Moscow River\" (\"Над Москвою-рекой\") (lyrics by Lev Kondyrev), and \"Golden Altai\" (\"Алтай золотой\") (lyrics by Tsezar Solodar). The composer also made his contribution to a subgenre of the Soviet song, the army song. He authored a song dedicated to the Soviet Pacific Fleet, \"Above the Bleak Kuriles Range\" (\"Над серой Курильской грядою\") (lyrics by Nikolai Bukin), a work which combined elements of heroic devotion to the Motherland with pensiveness and longing for the far-away family and its comforts.\n\nIn reflecting on the sources of inspiration for his songs, Serafim Tulikov later confessed that it came mostly from the reminiscences of his homeland, Kaluga, and most of the elements within the songs were present in Kaluga. In the early 1960s, Tulikov would write a song dedicated to Kaluga, properly entitled \"The Town of My Youth\" (\"Город юности моей\") (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), a sweet and unassuming yet sincere and heartfelt song.\n\nDuring Khrushchev's Virgin Lands Campaign of bringing the vast steppes of Kazakhstan and South Siberia into agricultural use, Tulikov composed another well known song, \"Komsomol Direction\" (\"Комсомольская путевка\") (lyrics by Tsezar Solodar), which declared: \"On the go! On the go! The Komsomol direction calls us! And the merry song at the threshold sees us off forward!\"\n\nMany of the older generation of Soviet composers did not feel particularly comfortable after the onset of the television age in the 1960s. Serafim Tulikov adjusted himself, and established himself as one of the leading and most popular Soviet song-writers.) His repertoire, as well as the stylistic forms he used, expanded significantly. On the one hand, Tulikov composed such near-hymnal solemn songs as \"Lenin is Forever with You\" (lyrics by Lev Oshanin), perhaps one of the most successful and widely known Soviet songs dedicated to Vladimir Lenin, and \"Motherland\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin). On the other hand, he wrote songs which clearly carried in themselves an imprint of the cultural thaw of the 1960s, such as \"Smile!\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), \"Equation with One Unknown\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky), and \"This will Never Be Repeated\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky) These contained no explicit elements of ideology or patriotism, and they were decidedly divorced from the folkloristic tradition in which the majority of Tulikov's lyrical songs of the 1940s-50s were rendered.\n\nTulikov continued to contribute mass songs dedicated to various important events in Soviet history and politics. His song \"To the Distant Planets!\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin) was a work of optimism designed to celebrate the USSR's technological breakthroughs. Unsurprisingly, it was written in the wake of Yuri Gagarin's first space journey in 1961. In 1964, Tulikov's only opera, \"Barankin, bud' chelovekom\", premiered in Moscow.\n\nIn the late 1960s Tulikov began to compose songs with overtly neo-Slavophile overtones. They were all dedicated to Russia, yet were different from his previous patriotic style. They became explicitly more folkloristic and filled with rural and natural imagery, such as Russia's meadows, fields, sky, lakes and rivers. The elements of wistfulness and even light sadness, as if bidding farewell to something destined to extinction, became more and more prominent. Examples of this period include \"There, Far Away is my Russia\" (lyrics by Vladimir Kharitonov), \"Love Confession\" (lyrics by Mikhail Tanich), \"Treasure Russia\" (lyrics by Oleg Miliavsky), and \"My Native Homeland\" (lyrics by Peter Gradov).\n\nTulikov continued to write songs dedicated to the Soviet Army, its exploits and traditions, such as \"Veterans' Souls Do Not Age\" (lyrics by Yakov Belinsky), which became popular with the USSR leadership, itself composed of many who actively participated in the Great Patriotic War, and \"The Son of Russia\" (lyrics by Vladimir Kharitonov). Tulikov became notorious for composing multiple songs about Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. For instance, an incredibly pompous and anthem-like song \"I Sing of My Motherland\" (lyrics by Nikolai Dorizo) was dedicated to the opening of the 26th Party Congress in 1981. The song praised the strength and the global mission of the Soviet state and pointed out that this strength was not based on fear and intimidation but rather on genuine achievements and generosity of the Soviet people.\n\nIn the early 1960s Tulikov wrote a very successful song about Moscow, \"I sing of you, my Moscow\" (lyrics by Yuri Polukhin). The phrase \"Moscow, your fame is flying on the wings of your glory all over the world! Moscow, you are the heart of my Motherland!\" became legendary. In the 1970s, Tulikov contributed several songs to the project of constructing the Baykal-Amur Mainline railway, launched by the Soviet government in 1974-75. The \"BAM Waltz\" (lyrics by Mikhail Pliatskovsky) became perhaps the most famous of these songs.\n\nAs the Soviet Union unravelled in the late 1980s, Serafim Tulikov found himself increasingly isolated and ill-equipped to deal with the change. Tulikov's traditionalism, as well as his penchant for slow-flowing and sweet lyrical tunes, was sharply at odds with the newly fashionable avant-garde and radical rejection of harmony and tranquility in music, in favor of cacophony and wild rhythms. Tulikov gradually faded away from public prominence. He died in retirement in 2004. Some of his musical legacy has been resurrected by the lovers of Soviet music. However, the majority of what has been reissued and revived has been Tulikov's most non-political, light lyrical music of the 1960s-70s.\n\n"}

While the planet may not reach the exact spot until the person is 29 or 30 years old, the influence of the Saturn return is considered to start in the person's late twenties, notably the age of 27.\nPsychologically, the first Saturn return is seen as the time of reaching full adulthood, and being faced, perhaps for the first time, with adult challenges and responsibilities.\n\nThe phenomenon is described by Western astrologers as influencing a person's life development at roughly 29.5 year intervals , though the planetary influence may be felt for a few years before the exact conjunction, and variable orbits of the planets can also make the time period longer or shorter . These intervals or \"returns\" coincide with the approximate time it takes the planet Saturn to make one orbit around the sun, roughly 29.5 years. Western astrologers believe that, as Saturn \"returns\" to the degree in its orbit occupied at the time of birth, a person crosses over a major threshold and enters the next stage of life. With the first Saturn return, a person leaves youth behind and enters adulthood. With the second return, maturity. And with the third and usually final return, a person enters wise old age. These periods are estimated to occur at roughly the ages of 27–31, 56–60 and 84–90. A fourth return occurs for very few people: those who live to see the age of 114–118.\n\nJyotish (South Asian) astrology views Saturn's transits around the 12 houses of the Zodiac as important during these moments: the \"sade-sati\" or -year period, in which Saturn transits the houses before and after, as well as in, the house where the native's Moon lies. These seven and a half years can often be difficult, and people go through difficulties and obstacles during these periods. Those with Capricorn, Aquarius and Libra Moons, however, see great progress, since Saturn rules the first two, and is exalted in the last sign. In addition, Saturn's transit through the Fourth and the Eighth Houses are also seen as important: known respectively as the \"dhaiya\" and \"astamashani\" periods.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2083397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083397", "title": "The Million Dollar Corporation", "text": "The Million Dollar Corporation\n\nThe Million Dollar Corporation was a professional wrestling stable in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from April 1994 to May 1996 and was led and managed by the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase. DiBiase had retired from active competition after a back injury in a match for All Japan Pro Wrestling in late 1993 and was brought back by the WWF as a manager.\n\nThe group's foundation was laid on the May 16, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw when Ted DiBiase announced that he had purchased the services of Nikolai Volkoff. Volkoff had fallen on hard times, and DiBiase took advantage by forcing him to be his servant in order for Volkoff to provide for his family. This included Volkoff wearing a tuxedo T-shirt as well as trunks that read \"Property of the Million Dollar Man\" along with cent signs, as opposed to the dollar signs DiBiase had worn on his trunks. Over the next couple of months, DiBiase acquired Bam Bam Bigelow as well as former tag team partner Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.).\n\nAnother infamous addition was made early on, when DiBiase claimed to be bringing The Undertaker back to the WWF after a long absence. On the June 11 episode of \"Superstars\" a man looking and sounding like The Undertaker was produced by DiBiase. Initially, announcers accepted DiBiase's claim, but eventually his man (wrestler Brian Lee) was revealed to be a doppelgänger. After a main event showdown with \"the real Undertaker\" at SummerSlam 1994, the Million Dollar Man's version was not seen again.\n\nAlso at SummerSlam 1994, the Corporation gained another member. For weeks, the WWF had teased a heel turn by Lex Luger as DiBiase's men constantly interfered in matches on his behalf and offered him bribes to join the stable. His tag team partner at the time, Tatanka, became suspicious and challenged him to a match, only to turn and join himself after DiBiase distracted Luger to set up the pin.\n\nKing Kong Bundy joined the group in October. At the 1994 Survivor Series, Corporation members Bundy, Bigelow and Tatanka teamed with The Heavenly Bodies to defeat a team captained by Lex Luger in an elimination tag team match.\n\nBam Bam Bigelow teamed with Tatanka to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the team's loss in a tournament final to determine new champions, Bigelow became involved in a worked altercation with football legend Lawrence Taylor at ringside. The two squared off in the main event of WrestleMania XI, where Taylor was victorious. After his loss to Taylor, relations soured between Bigelow and DiBiase, cooling for months until the former turned face and saved then-WWF Champion Diesel from a beating at the hands of the Corporation.\n\nThroughout 1995, the Corporation continued to feud with the WWF's top faces, including The Undertaker, Luger, Diesel, and Razor Ramon. To help fight off The Undertaker, DiBiase recruited Kama, who stole The Undertaker's urn and had it melted down into a gold chain for himself. In a memorable series of skits, IRS traveled to a graveyard in order to \"leave no stone unturned\" in his investigation of dead tax cheats, and to psych out The Undertaker. Undertaker would defeat IRS at the Royal Rumble and then King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania XI.\n\nDiBiase added Sycho Sid after Sid turned on Shawn Michaels following WrestleMania XI, and later added The 1-2-3 Kid during Sid's feud with Razor Ramon. However, one by one the Million Dollar Corporation began to disband as its members found themselves out of work. Bundy and IRS left the WWF in 1995, while Kama and Tatanka lasted until early 1996. The 1-2-3 Kid lasted until May 1996, while Sycho Sid entered a temporary retirement due to a severe neck injury. During the 1995 Christmas season, DiBiase added Xanta Klaus, a twisted take on Santa Claus, who hailed from the South Pole and reveled in taking from people rather than giving. However, the character lasted only a few appearances before being dropped. DiBiase, with nobody left to manage, was paired with former WCW star Steve Austin, who was given the name \"The Ringmaster\" and awarded the Million Dollar Championship by DiBiase, who also taught Austin his finishing move, the Million Dollar Dream. Although \"The Ringmaster\" name was dropped quickly and Austin adopted the \"Stone Cold\" moniker he later made famous, he continued to be managed by DiBiase and regarded as the Million Dollar Champion.\n\nDiBiase managed Austin through a feud with Savio Vega, where Austin won at WrestleMania XII after a belt shot with the Million Dollar Championship. Vega and Austin had a rematch at in a strap match. Per the stipulation of that match, Vega would have had to become DiBiase's chauffeur if Austin won but DiBiase would be forced to leave the company if Vega won, which he did. Austin claimed he had lost on purpose in order to rid himself of DiBiase, beginning a character transition for Austin while providing a storyline reason for DiBiase's departure; DiBiase had signed with rival promotion World Championship Wrestling shortly before this and debuted with the company later in 1996 as the financier for the nWo.\n\n\n\n"}

It borders Ecuador on the north and northeast, Huancabamba Province and Morropón Province on the south, and the Piura and Sullana provinces on the west. This province is located in the western Andes and its capital is the town of Ayabaca, which is the highest in the whole region.\n\nTwo bus companies cover the route Piura-Sullana-Ayavaca. The trip takes from 5 to 6 hours approximately. The province has a large border with Ecuador, and the oriental branch of the Pan-American Highway crosses the Suyo district, at the north of the province, connecting Piura, Sullana and Las Lomas with the Ecuadorian cities of Macará and Loja.\n\nThe name Ayabaca, also written as Ayavaca, derives from two Quechua roots: \"aya\", related to \"death\", but also to \"immortality\"; and \"huaca\" connected to \"sanctuaries\" and \"sacred places\". Some local monographs have limited its meaning to that of \"grave and ancient tomb of the dead\" (\"tumba de muertos\"). They believe this meaning suggests the name was derived from a site with ancient bones and primitive weapons found near the zone where the Spaniards gathered the native population in 1571, when they founded the first \"Pueblo de Indios de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Ayavaca\" or missioni \"Ayavaca Vieja\". Such bones and weapons may be the \"remains of hordes fallen in combat against the expansionist advance of the Incas\".\n\n\"Aya\" does not mean only a deceased or ancestor in the physical sense of the corpse or skeleton, but also in the symbolic and spiritual sense of the soul, consciousness and energy that departs the body, temporarily at night and definitely at the end of the life, but continues circulating in all vital processes, as the cycles of water, light and seasons, that move along with the Earth. With that association, \"aya\" is also related to the pale red or yellowish colors of twilight and of dawn, as well as to the paleness of newborns and dying persons. \"Huaca\" is the name of sacred places or objects. In this sense, the old sanctuary of \"Ayavaca\" or \"Ayahuaca\", situated in the western extreme of the mountain range of the Andes, an area where all regional rivers have their sources, is properly the Sanctuary of Death, but also of Immortality, of life’s changes and creative transformation. \n\nOne of Ayavaca's most important attractions is near Aypate, a site known as the Inca construction, about east of the province's capital. The Inca work is located on, or in front of, an ancient pre-Inca sanctuary. In 1996, the regional office of the National Institute of Culture recognized Aypate as the \"Archaeological Capital of Piura\". The name of Aypate (also Aypache or Allpachí), also identifies an important legendary figure considered a founding father in the history of this region. The legend describes the beginning of a golden age after a human triumph in understanding and conquering nature without harming it.\n\nDifferent places of the province have other evidence of ancient cultures, including petroglyphs (at El Toldo, Samanga), megalithic altars (Chocán, Montero), and remainders of the \"Qhapaq Ñan\" or Inca road.\n\nAyavaca has a multiplicity of landscapes that encompass zones of dry forest and areas of almost permanent humidity located in the mountain range, a region of páramos, lakes and humid forests that supply the main freshwater sources of all the Piura region. Some of these lakes are the Laguna Prieta, near Huamba and Samanga; the Lagunas Arrebiatadas, an assembly of lakes connected in descending levels; the Laguna del Cristal, El Cántaro, and the lake of Santa Clara or Siete Poderes.\n\nLikewise, in the large mountain area shared by the provinces of Ayavaca and Huancabamba, there is a great assembly of lakes locally known as The Huarinjas or Huaringas. One is the very important Laguna del Rey, (Lake of the King or Lake of the Inca King), the highest one in the sierra of Piura, in the district of Pacaipampa.\n\nThe provincial capital is the city of Ayavaca, located at of altitude, with a cold, healthy climate. Its Spanish foundation dates to 1571, when the missionaries gathered the local indigenous population to create the mission village of \"\"Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Ayavaca\".\"\n\nThe city has developed as the center of a great religious devotion, dedicated to Jesus Christ under the name of \"Señor Cautivo\" (Captive Lord). It is represented in the figure of an \"\"Ecce Homo\"\", which might have been inspired by the figure of Christ of Medinaceli, Spain, or by local religious traditions, or syncretic combination of both. The festival of the Señor Cautivo, whose central day is October 13, attracts numerous pilgrims from many different zones of north Peru, as well as from Ecuador and Colombia. Some pilgrims walk about from Tacna, in the south of Peru, making their pilgrimage the most extended one known on the South American continent. A secondary festival of the Señor Cautivo is conducted on January 1. Peasants from the Piura coast and valleys approach the sanctuary to petition for water or to express gratitude for the rains.\n\nThe Ayabaca Province is divided into ten districts (, singular: \"distrito\"), each of which is headed by a mayor (\"alcalde\"):\n\n"}

In \"Attorney General (Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd.) v Open Door Counselling Ltd. and Dublin Wellwoman Centre Ltd.\" (1988), an injunction was granted restraining two counseling agencies from assisting women to travel abroad to obtain abortions or informing them of the methods of communications with such clinics, and in \"Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd. v Grogan\" (1989), an injunction was granted restraining three students' unions from distributing information in relation to abortion available outside the state. The Fourteenth Amendment overturned these judgments and allowed for information on abortion under terms regulated by law.\n\nOn the same day, two referendums were held in response to aspects of the Supreme Court decision in the X Case decided in March 1992: the Twelfth Amendment which would have excluded the risk of suicide as grounds for an abortion, which was defeated, and the Thirteenth Amendment, to permit travel outside of the state to obtain an abortion, which was approved.

{"id": "2083415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083415", "title": "Navigation mesh", "text": "Navigation mesh\n\nA navigation mesh, or navmesh, is an abstract data structure used in artificial intelligence applications to aid agents in pathfinding through complicated spaces. This approach has been known since at least the mid-1980s in robotics, where it has been called a meadow map, and was popularized in video game AI in 2000.\n\nA navigation mesh is a collection of two-dimensional convex polygons (a polygon mesh) that define which areas of an environment are traversable by agents. In other words, a character in a game could freely walk around within these areas unobstructed by trees, lava, or other barriers that are part of the environment. Adjacent polygons are connected to each other in a graph.\n\nPathfinding within one of these polygons can be done trivially in a straight line because the polygon is convex and traversable. Pathfinding between polygons in the mesh can be done with one of the large number of graph search algorithms, such as A*. Agents on a navmesh can thus avoid computationally expensive collision detection checks with obstacles that are part of the environment.\n\nRepresenting traversable areas in a 2D-like form simplifies calculations that would otherwise need to be done in the \"true\" 3D environment, yet unlike a 2D grid it allows traversable areas that overlap above and below at different heights. The polygons of various sizes and shapes in navigation meshes can represent arbitrary environments with greater accuracy than regular grids can.\n\nNavigation meshes can be created manually, automatically, or by some combination of the two. In video games, a level designer might manually define the polygons of the navmesh in a level editor. This approach can be quite labor intensive. Alternatively, an application could be created that takes the level geometry as input and automatically outputs a navmesh.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that the environment represented by a navmesh is static – it does not change over time – and thus the navmesh can be created offline and be immutable. However, there has been some investigation of online updating of navmeshes for dynamic environments.\n\nIn robotics, using linked convex polygons in this manner has been called \"meadow mapping\", coined in a 1986 technical report by Ronald C. Arkin.\n\nNavigation meshes in video game artificial intelligence are usually credited to Greg Snook's 2000 article \"Simplified 3D Movement and Pathfinding Using Navigation Meshes\" in \"Game Programming Gems\". In 2001, J.M.P. van Waveren described a similar structure with convex and connected 3D polygons, dubbed the \"Area Awareness System\", used for bots in \"Quake III Arena\".\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Comunicación XERSA, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican broadcast company. 49 percent of the concessionaire is owned by an American company, Local Media of San Diego, which holds the right to use the frequency and programs the station from San Diego, along with two other Mexican FM stations broadcasting in English, Alternative Rock 91.1 XETRA-FM and Rhythmic AC 92.5 XHRM-FM. LMSD also wholly owns US-licensed 100.7 KFBG.\n\nXHITZ-FM's 100,000–watt transmitter and antenna are on Mount San Antonio in Tijuana. Because of this, it must abide by all Mexican broadcast regulations, including mandatory public service announcements, political coverage, and the compulsory airings of \"La Hora Nacional\" (\"The National Hour\") on Sunday nights, and the Mexican National Anthem at midnight and 5:00 a.m. nightly.\n\nLocal Media maintains the station's US studios and offices, which are on Cornerstone Court East in San Diego.\n\nXHITZ also airs the Top 40/CHR version of \"Sunday Night Slow Jams\", which begins at 11:00 p.m., after \"La Hora Nacional.\"\nIt is one of two San Diego/Tijuana affiliates for the program, the other being sister station XHRM-FM, which carries the main version.\n\nIn September 1970, the station signed on as XHIS-FM, more than three years before receiving its concession in November 1973. It was owned by Víctor Díaz, the founder of Califórmula Broadcasting, which would come to own and operate numerous stations in the San Diego-Tijuana radio market. However, it signed on with a brokered radio format from the United States. Time Sales, Inc., owned by radio automation pioneer Paul Schafer, and presented a jockless progressive rock format known as \"HIS Radio\". Time Sales added a second Mexican station when 100.1 XHERS-FM (now 104.5 XHLTN-FM), a soft rock station known as \"HERS Radio\", signed on in December, and a third, XHQS-FM 95.7 \"OURS\", was also planned. Aside from the music, HIS Radio featured parodies of commercials and a satirical radio novel, the O.B. Ranger. The operation was run by Larry Shushan, a former owner of KPRI FM radio and one of the builders of KAAR, San Diego's first UHF television station.\n\nXHIS and XHERS broadcast from a new facility in Tijuana with custom-built 100,000–watt transmitters, throwing maximum power at San Diego. These were the first border blasters on FM. Programming originated from Time Sales's studios and sales offices at the Royal Inn at the Wharf and was transported by cassette to the transmitter, as the Brinkley Act prevented a live hookup from being used. Within six months, Time Sales had two of the top three stations in San Diego.\n\nBy 1973, however, the tides had turned for Time Sales. San Diego broadcasters complained of disloyal competition across the border that didn't have to play by the Federal Communications Commission's rules for radio stations and decried the promotion of XHIS and XHERS as \"San Diego stations\" not using the X in their call signs. The FCC opened an investigation into Time Sales, Schafer and Shushan, resulting in mounting legal fees. Ultimately, Time Sales folded, and Díaz began operating the station under the brand \"Estéreo 90, La Buena Onda\". By 1975, XHIS was broadcasting soul music and R&B. Ironically, it was more popular with teens and women than with men.\n\nA 1981 row between Califórmula and politically motivated broadcast workers temporarily forced Díaz out of the broadcasting business. In April, a report had aired on one of the Califórmula stations criticizing Baja California Governor Roberto de la Madrid. Just two weeks after returning to an R&B format, in September, workers affiliated to the Union of Radio and Television Industry Workers (STIRT) went on strike, and the only way to resolve the strike was to sell XHIS and XHERS to Francisco Aguirre, founder of Mexico City broadcaster Grupo Radio Centro. The Tijuana acquisition marked GRC's first ever expansion outside the capital city.\n\nTwo years later, Díaz bought back the cluster of XHIS and XHERS, instituting new call signs and formats on both. That year, XHIS became XHITZ-FM and changed to an album-oriented rock format under contract to San Diego Radio Company. However, in 1984, the station stumbled in an ownership dispute. A bitter battle between San Diego Radio Company and Califórmula led to the abrupt end of the album rock format as the latter took control of the station. Díaz cited continued low ratings, but the straw that broke the camel's back was a humorous news report read on the station that stated a German anthropologist had discovered a tribe of \"mole people\" living in the sewers of Mexico City. When the report was read in late June, it caught the attention of Mexican authorities, who were outraged over the secondhand account they had heard, which implied that Mexicans were so poor they lived in sewers.\n\nIn 1986, Díaz sold the American marketing rights for XHITZ again, this time to Broadcasting, Marketing and Management, Ltd. BMM ceased operation of the station on June 30, 1988 as it assigned the rights to another company, Consolidated Radio Sales, which was also bankrupt. The result was that Díaz and the head of Consolidated Radio Sales, Jack McCoy, clashed. In mid-July, McCoy fired all the employees in the US and had all the locks changed, with several employees instead showing up to work in Tijuana. Later that day, however, a bankruptcy judge ruled that Díaz owned the US operation of the stations.\n\nIn 1989, XHITZ flipped from adult contemporary to a rock-oriented hits format known as \"Pirate Radio,\" based on the success of KQLZ in Los Angeles. On April 5, 1990, however, XHITZ switched formats to Rhythmic Top 40 under Program Director Rick Thomas, with a Dance-leaning direction. \"Z90\" competed against Q106, which was the powerhouse of Top 40 in the market. With Z90's debut, however, it took only a few books for XHITZ to beat Q106, and thanks to its success, it also forced the market's only Urban Contemporary outlet, future sister station XHRM-FM, out of that format by 1993. As Z90 remained on top, Q106 shifted towards a more Mainstream Top 40 format, and it wasn't until September 1996 that XHITZ would have another direct competitor against KHTS, which had a Dance lean, much like XHITZ. Even though XHITZ served as the official callsign, it was marketed unofficially as \"XHTZ\" also due to the fact most TV & radio callsigns carry four letters.\n\nHowever by August 1998, XHITZ would move away from its Dance approach to begin focusing more on R&B/Hip-Hop. The station also rebranded as \"Jammin' Z90\" before reverting to \"Z90.3\". In 2002, Califórmula, which wound down most of its operations over the early 2000s as Díaz retired and then died. The US operating rights were sold to Clear Channel Communications (forerunner of today's iHeartMedia) and the concession was transferred to a new Mexican concern, Comunicación XERSA. XHITZ remained a hip-hop leader until 2004, when 98.9 XHMORE-FM flipped to a hip hop-leaning Rhythmic Top 40. These two stations would battle until late 2009, when XHMORE changed formats. Shortly after this, XHITZ shifted back to its Dance-leaning and more Mainstream sound. Despite being the market's only Rhythmic Top 40, XHITZ continued to share much of the same music as KHTS-FM and KEGY, all of whom are Rhythmic-leaning Top 40/CHRs, along with Adult Top 40 KMYI. On April 2, 2012, XHITZ rebranded itself from \"Z90.3\" to \"Jammin' Z90.\" In mid-2014, XHITZ rebranded back to \"Z90.\" Today, the station airs a CHR format, resulting in both Nielsen BDS and Mediabase moving XHITZ from the Rhythmic to Mainstream reporting panels in February 2015.\n\nClear Channel controlled XHITZ and two other radio stations licensed to Mexico but programmed in English and aimed at the San Diego market, as well as owning five FM stations in San Diego as well. A 2003 Federal Communications Commission ruling forced Clear Channel to divest the operating rights to its Mexican stations in order to remain under FCC ownership caps. On July 25, 2005, Clear Channel transferred the programming and local marketing arrangements of XHITZ, along with XETRA-FM and XHRM-FM, to Finest City Broadcasting, a new company under the direction of former Clear Channel/San Diego VP/Market Manager Mike Glickenhaus. Finest City took over operations on December 1, 2005. \n\nIn 2009, these programming and marketing rights were sold to Broadcast Corporation of the Americas after Finest City defaulted on assets that resulted in its bankruptcy. In 2010, BCA would spin off XHITZ, XETRA and XHRM to Local Media of America after a change in management.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Midwest Television (owners of 760 KFMB and 100.7 KFMB-FM) announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, forming an entity known as SDLocal to manage their collective cluster of stations. The intent of this agreement was to \"[preserve the] local ownership and operation of San Diego's top-rated radio stations\". The agreement ended at the end of 2016. Local Media San Diego eventually acquired KFMB and KFMB-FM outright from Tegna, Inc. on March 17, 2020, with KFMB (AM) being concurrently divested to iHeartMedia; Tegna had purchased Midwest Television's stations in 2018.\n\n"}

The team held the WWF Tag Team Championship on one occasion.\n\nThe precursor for the formation of happened on a June 1991 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" when Jimmy Hart announced he had signed André the Giant to form a tag team with Earthquake. When asked by interviewer Gene Okerlund to confirm, André denied the claims, leaving Hart angry and humiliated. Earthquake responded by attacking André from behind with Hart's megaphone and injuring André's knee.\n\nJimmy Hart got revenge for the humiliation a few weeks later during a six-man tag team match featuring Earthquake and The Nasty Boys against the massive Tugboat and The Bushwhackers. It was revealed in this match that Hart secretly signed Tugboat, who turned on his partners after a few minutes of action and joined the Earthquake in laying the two New Zealanders out cold with a big splash. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as “The Natural Disasters”.\n\nThe Natural Disasters faced the Bushwhackers, with André in their corner, at the 1991 SummerSlam pay-per-view, whom they made very short work of. After destroying the Bushwhackers, the Disasters targeted André, but the assault was stopped by the Legion of Doom who ran off the Natural Disasters and kicked off the Legion of Doom / Natural Disasters feud. Later in the night the Legion of Doom would go on to win the WWF World Tag Team titles from the Nasty Boys, which meant that the Natural Disasters became first in line to get a shot at the new champions.\n\nThe first big profile meeting between the two teams came at the 1991 Survivor Series where they were on opposing sides in an elimination match. Typhoon was eliminated due to a miscommunication with team member Irwin R. Schyster followed by Earthquake walking out with him, leaving the Legion of Doom as the eventual winners. From November to January the Disasters challenged for the tag team titles on the house show circuit but usually without a decisive outcome. At the 1992 Royal Rumble the Disasters got their biggest opportunity so far as they received a shot at the titles. The Disasters won the match via count out but not the titles.\n\nIn February, Natural Disasters' manager Jimmy Hart led Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster) to the WWF tag team titles as they defeated the Legion of Doom after which the L.O.D. briefly left the WWF. The Natural Disasters were outraged that their manager would go behind their backs and get another team a shot at the title, the storyline explanation was that Jimmy Hart used the Disasters' guaranteed return match for Money Inc. When the Natural Disasters challenged Money Inc. they won the fan support as they fired manager Jimmy Hart. The Disasters would first get their hands on Money Inc. at WrestleMania VIII where once again the Natural Disasters would win the match but not the titles as the champions were counted out. The Disasters did not let the setback stop them as they challenged for the titles repeatedly until they won them on July 20, 1992.\n\nAfter losing the titles Money Inc. had to focus on the challenges by the Legion of Doom, which gave the Natural Disasters the opportunity to defend their newly won titles against new competition. That competition came in the form of The Beverly Brothers (managed by The Genius), whom they defeated at SummerSlam 1992, the Disasters' first PPV pinfall in a year. Afterwards, the Disasters faced challenges by both the Nasty Boys and Money Inc., both managed by Jimmy Hart. In a series of events that mirrored how the Natural Disasters turned face the Nasty Boys turned on Jimmy Hart when Hart favored Money Inc. when signing title matches. The Nasty Boys turned on Hart, while Money Inc. regained the tag team titles from the Natural Disasters in October 1992. With the Nasty Boys also in the hunt for the tag team gold the Natural Disasters were slowly phased out of the tag team division with their last PPV outing as a team came at the 1992 Survivor Series PPV where they were eliminated by Money Inc.\n\nIn 1993, Earthquake and Typhoon began showing signs of dissention, most noticeably at the 1993 Royal Rumble. Typhoon was already in the ring when Earthquake entered as #23 and he immediately went after his tag team partner, focusing only on him until Typhoon was eliminated. The Disasters’ feud never came to fruition as Earthquake left the WWF very early in 1993.\n\nTyphoon briefly stayed with the WWF after Earthquake left but never made anything as a singles competitor. Then, in mid-1993 he signed with WCW and made his infamous debut as The Shockmaster. He would later find himself in the WWF for a brief stay as Typhoon but again did not rise above mid card.\n\nEarthquake traveled to Japan in 1993 but made a very brief return in 1994 to engage in a “Sumo Vs Sumo” feud with Yokozuna. For the few months Earthquake was in the WWF, no mention of the tag team was made. He then went to WCW, where he wrestled as Avalanche at first and later became The Shark and finally wrestled under his real name before leaving. Earthquake briefly returned to the WWF in 1998 as the masked mute Golga, as a member of The Oddities.\n\nIn 2001, the WWF hosted a sort of reunion of the Natural Disasters as they were both involved in the Gimmick Battle Royal of WrestleMania X-Seven, but Fred Ottman wrestled as Tugboat instead of Typhoon. Commentator Bobby Heenan, however, did allude to their previous alliance. Also, it was Earthquake who wound up eliminating Tugboat. In December of that year, Earthquake also wrestled in a tryout dark match at a \"SmackDown\" taping, but made no further appearances.\n\nJohn Tenta (Earthquake) died from bladder cancer in 2006.\n\nThe Natural Disasters appear in WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18.\n\n\n\n"}

The chain consisted of two- or three-story interior-corridor buildings constructed based on the company's prototype designs. Properties were usually a long, two- or three-story building with a gabled or lobby and public area at one end. All properties featured indoor pools and consistent amenities, which was the chain's main selling point. Founded in 1989 by (now) Arlington Hospitality, Cendant Corporation purchased the franchise rights in the late 1990s. Arlington continued to build and develop AmeriHost Inns using the prototype it originally created for the chain during this time. However, Cendant granted a small number of AmeriHost franchises to existing properties that do not conform to the original prototype standards, during the start of the millennium. \n\nIn 2006, Cendant (now Wyndham Worldwide) announced that all Amerihost Inns would be rebranded as Baymont Inns.

{"id": "2083430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083430", "title": "KWHY-TV", "text": "KWHY-TV\n\nKWHY-TV, virtual channel 22 (VHF digital channel 4), is a Spanish-language independent television station licensed to Los Angeles, California, United States. The station is owned by Meruelo Broadcasting as part of a duopoly with Garden Grove-licensed Spanish-language independent KBEH (channel 63); the two stations share channel 4 under a channel sharing agreement. KWHY and KBEH share studios on West Pico Boulevard in the Mid-City section of Los Angeles and transmitter facilities atop Mount Harvard. \n\nOn June 19, 1952, John Poole, owner of radio station KBIG (740 AM), filed for a construction permit for a new television station on channel 22 in Los Angeles, which was granted as KPIK on December 20, 1952. It was stated in February that KPIK would debut that fall. Poole announced that the facility, with an effective radiated power of 540,000 watts, would be the most powerful in the country. Construction began in March on a new facility atop Mount Wilson which was proposed to house the UHF television stations proposed for channels 22, 28 and 34 in Los Angeles. The call letters were changed to KBIC-TV, previously housed on the Poole construction permit for channel 46 at Sacramento, on November 10, 1953. KBIC-TV did transmit a test image in 1954, but it never entered program service.\n\nThe channel 22 construction permit languished until it was sold in 1962 to the Central Broadcasting Corporation of California for $180,000; the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale in January 1963. On January 25, 1963, the call letters were changed to KIIX (pronounced \"kicks\"), which proceeded to announce that it would aim its programming at the African American community, as the second station of its kind after WOOK-TV in Washington, D.C. Central established studios at 2330 W. Washington Blvd., a former car dealership where the showroom floor became a studio, and set a program schedule of seven hours a day including kids, teenage and news shows. On March 25, KIIX at last entered program service, more than a decade after the original grant of the construction permit to Poole and 20 days after WOOK-TV launched. 30-year-old Larry McCormick, who had held down morning drive at KGFJ (1230 AM), worked at channel 22, hosting \"KIIXville\", a daily music hour; Los Angeles Rams players Dick Bass and Pervis Atkins covered sports. Three quarters of the station's staff was black.\n\nKIIX had an ambitious start, but it showed signs of financial distress within months. On August 1, it axed much of its live programming and fired 35 staff, a significant change for a station that once produced all but 30 minutes of its six-hour broadcast day live; instead, KIIX would run two hours of films a day to maintain its license. Los Angeles fire commissioner Fred Kline urged the city council to buy KIIX, valued at $485,000 in mostly equipment, for use as an emergency broadcast outlet and even to broadcast criminal lineups instead of having victims drive to police headquarters. Relief would not come until 1964, when the Coast Television Broadcasting Corporation, sister to the Coast Radio Broadcasting Corporation and its KPOL (1540 AM), acquired the station for a total of $205,000 in cash consideration and assumption of notes.\n\nAfter being off the air since September 1964, channel 22 returned under its new ownership March 29, 1965—delayed from a planned March 1 start—as KPOL-TV, primarily broadcasting older filmed programming; the station was notable for running a limited commercial inventory, with breaks every 15 minutes during movies and no tobacco or alcohol advertising.\n\nThe Capital Cities Broadcasting Company acquired KPOL radio and television in 1966 and immediately spun off the television station to Coast stockholders, including KPOL general manager Frederick Custer and channel 22 program director Robertson Scott, for $400,000. The call letters were changed to KWHY-TV on August 15. On November 14, channel 22 would debut a program that would become a fixture for 35 years: an eight-hour program of stock market coverage, from the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange to the closing bell of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Prior to the launch of the stock market program, the station was not broadcasting during the day. By 1969, \"The Stock Market Observer\", produced by Scantlin Electronics of Los Angeles, aired in four cities. On weeknights, channel 22 showed Spanish-language fare, and weekends included shows in Korean, Japanese and Chinese.\n\nCoast reached a deal to sell KWHY-TV to Zenith Electronics in 1971; channel 22 would have served as the Los Angeles-area outlet for its Phonevision pay television system. The sale application was dismissed the next year.\nWhile Zenith's bid to use channel 22 for subscription television had fallen through, another operator would succeed in July 1978. SelecTV, owned by American Subscription Television, launched with a model whereby subscribers paid per program viewed. This differentiated it from competing ON TV, where subscribers paid a flat fee. By November, SelecTV had signed up 5,000 subscribers. Additionally, KWHY-TV increased its effective radiated power from 107,000 watts to 2.57 million.\n\nIn 1981, Burt Harris of Harriscope and SelecTV teamed up to buy KWHY-TV from Coast Television for $5.3 million; SelecTV opted to exercise an option to buy channel 22 after Coast continually opposed the airing of R-rated movies by SelecTV. KWHY-TV took the business news programming through a number of facelifts and distribution expansions. In the 1980s, as cable television's reach expanded beyond Los Angeles, the business news format was reinvented. A complete graphical overhaul was made, creating the first multi-element screen. This showed all of the stock and commodity indexes, two rows of stock ticker tapes and over-the-shoulder real-time pricing information; meanwhile, an anchor read the news live. The service was renamed \"The Business Channel\". During this time, KWHY became the first station in the country with an automated commercial playback machine, and the first to utilize computer animation from an optical disc player.\n\nSelecTV continued to broadcast, even as subscriber numbers for subscription television dwindled. When ON TV folded in Los Angeles, SelecTV acquired its subscribers. SelecTV was acquired by Telstar in January 1987 Continued erosion of the service's subscriber base led KWHY to start preparing a transition to Spanish-language programming during prime time. SelecTV ceased operating over KWHY after more than a decade of operations on March 31, 1989, having reached a deal to conclude the month after going into bankruptcy; one night, KWHY did not air SelecTV because the station had not been paid.\n\nWithout SelecTV, KWHY became a Spanish-language independent station outside of The Business Channel programming on April 1, 1989. It initially aired programming from the Galavision basic cable network, which was at the time preparing to convert to broadcast operations in several cities. However, when Televisa, the owner of Galavision, became a part-owner of Univision, the station ceased broadcasting Galavision programming, carrying a mix of classic movies, game shows and newscasts.\n\nThe Business Channel also continued; in 1994, daily market commentator Gene R. Morgan was hit with a $50,000 fine for misrepresenting a stock he underwrote and promoted on his KWHY program. The brand changed to \"22 Business News\" in 1997 and then \"Business News 22\" in 1999. On October 4, 1999, KWHY stopped carrying Business News 22, citing a desire to broadcast as a full-time Spanish-language independent due to strong viewer demand. KJLA (channel 57) took over the broadcast of Business News 22 under a time brokerage agreement, and the station announced that it would carry the program on its new digital television station upon its launch; additionally, Business News 22 launched an internet presence at businessnews2000.com. A year later, KJLA discontinued the broadcast of \"BizNews 1\".\n\nIn 2001, following the FCC's decision to allow duopolies (the ownership of two television stations in a single market by one company), Telemundo (which already owned its West Coast flagship, KVEA channel 52) purchased KWHY for $239 million, continuing to operate it as an independent. After NBC purchased Telemundo in 2002, KVEA and KWHY's operations were integrated with NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC (channel 4) at the NBC Studios complex (now The Burbank Studios) in Burbank. NBC Universal (the company that was created through Vivendi Universal's purchase of NBC in 2003) was temporarily allowed to own three stations in the Los Angeles market while FCC regulations normally limited ownership to two. KWHY and KVEA were a duopoly before NBC/Telemundo merged and were allowed to remain co-owned by the FCC pending a decision on the ownership caps.\n\nOn September 9, 2007, NBC Universal announced it would place KWHY and its San Juan, Puerto Rico sister station WKAQ-TV up for sale; this came after NBCU's acquisition of Oxygen Media. The stations were taken off the sale market just over three months later on December 21, 2007.\n\nOn May 7, 2010, it was reported that NBCUniversal planned to sell KWHY due to its pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal and Comcast had been hoping that the FCC would ease its media ownership rules and allow them to own three stations in major markets, but after the FCC's first bid to do so was overturned in court, the agency took no further steps in that direction. On January 26, 2011, NBCU announced that it would sell KWHY-TV to locally based investment firm The Meruelo Group. The deal was approved by the FCC in April and officially closed on July 6, 2011.\n\nOn August 13, 2012, the station became a charter affiliate of MundoFox and effectively served as the network's flagship station. The station also intended to expand its local news programming. In addition, non-network programming, along with the station's classic television program inventory, subsequently moved to a new digital subchannel that launched the same day under the branding \"Super 22.2\".\n\nOn July 27, 2015, the station rebranded as \"MundoMax 22\", in accordance with the network rebranding. A month later, on August 31, Meruelo announced that RCN Television, which owned MundoMax, would take over KWHY-TV's sales and marketing as of September 1; RCN also simultaneously took over the operations of the network's Houston affiliate, KUVM-CD, through a similar arrangement.\n\nOn December 1, 2016, following the demise of MundoMax, KWHY-TV once more began programming a Spanish-language independent format on the station's primary channel. KWHY began to run a broad mix of Spanish language music and entertainment programming (such as \"Operación Repo\", \"Cuanto Cuesta el Show\", \"Sala de Justicia\", \"Fiesta de Comediantes\", \"Cine Mexicano\", \"Cine a la Cama\" and \"Cineteca 22\", among others); it also started airing local Spanish-language newscasts produced in Monterrey, Mexico by Milenio Television branded as \"Noticias 22 Milenio\", later shortened to \"Milenio Noticias\", as well as national broadcasts from Milenio Television. \n\nOn August 26, 2019, KWHY-DT2 converted from a time lease by the Universal Church to carry their programming to become an affiliate of Retro TV.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKWHY-TV became the first UHF station in the market to sign-on a high definition digital signal in 2001. the station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, using PSIP to display KWHY-TV's virtual channel as 22 on digital television receivers.\n\nBy August 2015, KWHY-TV broadcast five hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour each on weekdays; the station did not broadcast any local newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition, the station produced the news and lifestyle program \"Viva el 22\", which airs weekday mornings at 8 a.m. KWHY held the distinction of being the first station in Los Angeles to utilize news anchor-operated TelePrompters for newscasts, and the first to use a news-oriented non-linear editing system (operated by Grass Valley). Following the August 31, 2015 announcement that RCN Television would take over KWHY's operations, the station's newscasts were immediately canceled and the news operation was closed down (RCN had also discontinued MundoFox/MundoMax's national news operation after acquiring full control of the network in July). The station's lead anchor, Palmira Pérez (who was one of five station staffers retained by RCN), was reassigned to anchor one-minute local and national news updates during MundoMax programming.\n\nThe station resumed airing news programming on March 13, 2017, carrying newscasts outsourced from Grupo Multimedios networks in Monterrey, Mexico, including Milenio Televisión and Multimedios Televisión's \"Telediario\" division. A newscast made for KWHY is taped between 3:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time from the \"Telediario\" set. The newscasts are anchored by the afternoon \"Telediario\" anchor team of Priscila Cantú and Miguel Karcz, and air weekdays at 7 p.m (1 hour) and 10 p.m. (35 minutes). The weekend edition of the newscast also airs at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. and is anchored by Pedro Gamboa.\n\nThe network also airs three editions of \"Milenio Noticias\" throughout the day and one on weekends, all on tape delay: \n\n\n\nKWHY over the years has operated several translator facilities in southern California and beyond.\n\nIn Santa Barbara, the station owned KWHY-LP channel 22 (formerly on UHF channel 65); that repeater's transmitter facilities were destroyed by the Montecito Tea Fire on November 14, 2008, and the license was surrendered a year later. K46GF in Santa Maria and K47GD-D in San Luis Obispo were surrendered for cancellation on January 9, 2019.\nKWHY-TV also provided much of the programming to San Diego Spanish independent station KBOP-CA; what became KSEX-CD later operated independently from KWHY before closing in 2017. The station also aired on K53GF (channel 53; formerly K67FE on channel 67) in Phoenix, Arizona in the late 1990s and early 2000s; as with the San Diego station, what is now K14RK-D now operates separately.\n\n"}

Cohen and Abraham Seidenberg. These are known as the going-up and going-down theorems.\n\nLet \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" be an extension of commutative rings.\n\nThe going-up and going-down theorems give sufficient conditions for a chain of prime ideals in \"B\", each member of which lies over members of a longer chain of prime ideals in \"A\", to be able to be extended to the length of the chain of prime ideals in \"A\".\n\nFirst, we fix some terminology. If formula_1 and formula_2 are prime ideals of \"A\" and \"B\", respectively, such that\n\n(note that formula_4 is automatically a prime ideal of \"A\") then we say that formula_1 \"lies under\" formula_2 and that formula_2 \"lies over\" formula_1. In general, a ring extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" of commutative rings is said to satisfy the lying over property if every prime ideal formula_1 of \"A\" lies under some prime ideal formula_2 of \"B\".\n\nThe extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is said to satisfy the incomparability property if whenever formula_2 and formula_12 are distinct primes of \"B\" lying over a prime formula_1 in \"A\", then formula_2 ⊈ formula_12 and formula_12 ⊈ formula_2.\n\nThe ring extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is said to satisfy the going-up property if whenever\n\nis a chain of prime ideals of \"A\" and\n\n(\"m\" < \"n\") is a chain of prime ideals of \"B\" such that for each 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"m\", formula_20 lies over formula_21, then the latter chain can be extended to a chain\n\nsuch that for each 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"n\", formula_20 lies over formula_21.\n\nIn it is shown that if an extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" satisfies the going-up property, then it also satisfies the lying-over property.\n\nThe ring extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is said to satisfy the going-down property if whenever\n\nis a chain of prime ideals of \"A\" and\n\n(\"m\" < \"n\") is a chain of prime ideals of \"B\" such that for each 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"m\", formula_20 lies over formula_21, then the latter chain can be extended to a chain\n\nsuch that for each 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"n\", formula_20 lies over formula_21.\n\nThere is a generalization of the ring extension case with ring morphisms. Let \"f\" : \"A\" → \"B\" be a (unital) ring homomorphism so that \"B\" is a ring extension of \"f\"(\"A\"). Then \"f\" is said to satisfy the going-up property if the going-up property holds for \"f\"(\"A\") in \"B\".\n\nSimilarly, if \"B\" is a ring extension of \"f\"(\"A\"), then \"f\" is said to satisfy the going-down property if the going-down property holds for \"f\"(\"A\") in \"B\".\n\nIn the case of ordinary ring extensions such as \"A\" ⊆ \"B\", the inclusion map is the pertinent map.\n\nThe usual statements of going-up and going-down theorems refer to a ring extension \"A\" ⊆ \"B\":\n\nThere is another sufficient condition for the going-down property:\n\n\"Proof\": Let \"p\" ⊆ \"p\" be prime ideals of \"A\" and let \"q\" be a prime ideal of \"B\" such that \"q\" ∩ \"A\" = \"p\". We wish to prove that there is a prime ideal \"q\" of \"B\" contained in \"q\" such that \"q\" ∩ \"A\" = \"p\". Since \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is a flat extension of rings, it follows that \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is a flat extension of rings. In fact, \"A\" ⊆ \"B\" is a faithfully flat extension of rings since the inclusion map \"A\" → \"B\" is a local homomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on spectra Spec(\"B\") → Spec(\"A\") is surjective and there exists a prime ideal of \"B\" that contracts to the prime ideal \"p\"\"A\" of \"A\". The contraction of this prime ideal of \"B\" to \"B\" is a prime ideal \"q\" of \"B\" contained in \"q\" that contracts to \"p\". The proof is complete. Q.E.D.\n\n"}

She took part in the Bengali nationalist movement of the 1950s and civil society leader in independent Bangladesh. She died in 1999 and was the first woman to be given a state funeral in Bangladesh.\n\nKamal was born in Shaestabad, Barisal. During her childhood, women's education was prohibited and she could not afford to get academic education. Nevertheless, she learned Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Arabic languages at home education. In 1918, she went to Kolkata with her mother where she came to meet with Begum Rokeya. She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain who was a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahar. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Sufia married Kamaluddin Ahmed.\n\nKamal later had two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal, and two sons Shahed Kamal and Sajed Kamal.\n\nIn 1925, Kamal met Mahatma Gandhi, which inspired her to wear simple clothing.\nKamal's first poem, \"Bashanti\" (\"Of Spring\"), was published in \"Saogat\" magazine in 1926. In 1931 she became the first Bengali Muslim female to be a member of the \"Indian Women Federation\".\n\nA short story \"Shainik Bodhu\" which Kamal wrote was published in a local paper in 1923. In 1937, she published her first collection of short stories, \"Keyar Kanta\" (\"Thorns of the Keya Tree\"). Her literary career took off after her first poetry publication. Her first book of poems, \"Sanjher Maya\" (\"Evening Enchantment\"), came out in 1938, bearing a foreword from Kazi Nazrul Islam and attracting praise from Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nIn 1947, Kamal became the inaugural editor of the \"Begum\" weekly magazine specialized on women's issues which was published by Mohammad Nasiruddin. In October of that year after the partition of India she came to Dhaka. During a huge clash between Hindu and Muslim of that time Kamal worked for their friendship and joined in Peace Committee. In 1948, when \"Purbo Pakistan Mohila Committee\" formed, she became its chairman. Kamal's activism continued in 1952, with the Language Movement. In 1961, when the Pakistani government banned Rabindra Sangeet (Songs of Rabindranath), she became involved in the movement among Bengalis that ensued in 1961. During the mass uprising in 1969, which demanded the resignation of Pakistani military general Ayub Khan, she promoted the cause by forming \"Mohila Sangram Parishad\" (\"Women's Struggle Group\").\n\nIn later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organisation, Mahila Parishad, for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue. She was also the first Chairperson of BRAC (1972–1980).\n\nKamal was instrumental in getting the first women's dormitory of Dhaka University to be named \"Rokeya Hall\", after Begum Rokeya.\n\nKamal showed her bravery several times. Once Ayub Khan at a meeting with social elites of Dhaka, commented that ordinary people are like beasts and as such, not fit to be given franchise. Sufia Kamal at once stood up and remarked, \"If the people are beasts then as the President of the Republic, you are the king of the beasts.\"\n\nWhen the news of the 'killings' of Kamal and Dr Nilima Ibrahim by Pak Army after the crack down on 25 March 1971 was broadcast on Akashbani, a radio station of the Indian state West Bengal, it drew criticism internationally and countries across the world put diplomatic pressure on the then Pakistani military government for clarification. The Pakistani government was forced to broadcast an interview with the poet on radio only to prove that Sufia Kamal was still alive.\n\nZillur Rahman, the then regional director of Radio East Pakistan, forwarded a paper to Kamal to sign with the statement \"In 1971 no massacre took place in Bangladesh.\" When she refused, Rahman threatened, \"If you don't give your signature then it might create a problem both for you and your son-in-law Kahar Chowdhury.\" She told him that she didn't care for her life. She said, \"I would rather die than put my signature on the false statement.\"\n\nShe actively but secretly helped freedom fighters of the Liberation War. In 1971, several people in Dhaka including professor Ghyasuddin Ahmed and writer Shahidullah Kaiser collected medicine and food and delivered those to the posts of Sufia Kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. From July 1971, she used to go to the hospital with food and medicine for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of food and medicine in the hospital. She used to give food and medicine to certain rickshaw pullers at the Science Laboratory, Dhaka. They would take the food and medicine to the freedom fighters. She was able to establish closer contact with the freedom fighters such as Abul Barak Alvi, Shafi Imam Rumi, Masud Sadek Chullu and Jewel in August. As the Pakistani army kept their strong watch on her, she would try to help the freedom fighters in different ways ignoring the risks. Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in the hand of the Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very angry with her. Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.\n\n\n\nThe National Public Library in Dhaka is named the Sufia Kamal National Public Library in her honour. On June 20, 2019, Google celebrated her 108th birthday with a Google Doodle.\n"}

When the PC Party and the Canadian Alliance merged in 2004, a formalized youth group was rejected by delegates at the founding convention of the Conservative Party in Montréal by a vote of 51% to 49%. As a result of that vote, PCYF ceased to exist.\n\nPCYF had operated in various capacities for more than 60 years. Its genesis arose from two unique sources – campus politics and riding politics. In a time when few Canadians went to University, a young Progressive Conservative was any person under the age of 35. The president of the early Young Conservatives was often a successful person in their 30s - a Member of Parliament or senior political staffer.\n\nConservative campus politics can be traced back to the University of Toronto campus club in 1926. However, the national Progressive Conservative Student Federation was not created until 1946. Campus politics gained importance in the 1950s and played a key role in the rise to power of John Diefenbaker and his eventual overthrow (through a Leadership review). Former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark got his political start as a \"Youth for Diefenbaker\". Today, campus clubs are a way of organizing and involving students in the party, but in the 1950s, campus politics were a venue for the political parties to control student politics.\nIn the 1960s, the two national youth organizations that had served the party for decades merged into one group. The federation of campus clubs (Progressive Conservative Student Federation) and the non-University, riding-based youth group (Young Progressive Conservative Association) merged to create the Progressive Conservative Youth Federation. PCYF was then sanctioned as the PC Party’s official youth wing. \n\nAs in many political parties, youth members could vote at national conventions that pick leaders and establish policy. In the Progressive Conservative Party, they accounted for 1/3 of all elected delegates, giving youth a significant influence on the direction the party took. This incorporated a democratic counterweight to established party hierarchy, manifesting itself dramatically in grassroots conventions that elected (and eventually removed) John Diefenbaker, Brian Mulroney, and Kim Campbell. \n\nMany prominent Tories got their start in the youth wing, including: Brian Mulroney, Joe Clark and Jean Charest.\n\nThe PCYF was headed by a national executive, which was elected at a General meeting held every 2–3 years. The executive consisted of:\n\n\nIn the early years of the organization, a youth member was described as someone under the age of 35. As a result of amendments to the PC Party constitution at the Winnipeg convention in 1996, the age range was reduced so as to only include members between the ages of 14 and 25.\n\nThe organization was primarily funded through an annual grant from the PC Party of Canada. However, the grant was not a preset amount and varied wildly based on the current fortunes of the national party.\n\nPCYF was allowed to raise its own funds, but these efforts were often crippled by a lack of experience from those involved, competing efforts from the central party, or competition from youth raising funds for the next general meeting.\n\nThe PCYF was a leader in sentiment to merge the PC Party of Canada with the Reform Party of Canada and its successor, the Canadian Alliance. At the Winnipeg convention in 1996, PCYF President Tasha Kheiriddin circulated the 'Tory Top Ten', a list of policies which included a 10% personal income tax cut. The PCYF were successful in having this measure adopted by the party, thus making it the first federal political party to call for income tax cuts.\n\nIn the 1998 PCYF elections, future MP Patrick Brown, who then was then only 19 years old, was elected PCYF president in a hotly contested race. Brown won the presidential election based on heavy support from Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. Also elected were Adam Daifallah and Jasmine Igneski. Both Daifallah and Igneski made a well-publicized defection to the Canadian Alliance during the 1999 PC Party National Meeting in Toronto. Daifallah would later become a well-known author and Jasmine Igneski a member of Prime Minister Harper's office. \n\nPatrick Brown caused considerable controversy as PCYF president in 1999 when he pushed for the merger of the right wing movement despite the objection of Tory leader Joe Clark. This move eventually led to PCYF aggressively pushing a united right during the tenure of Brown's presidency. Brown faced considerable opposition from some members of the senior party who were hostile to a united right. Brown campaigned on TV along with Adam Daifallah for the united right. These activities were consistent with a long history of PCYF activism that made lasting contributions to Canada's political democracy, including the removal of John Diefenbaker by Dalton Camp, the adoption of Leadership review as a process to enshrine accountability, the leadership selection of Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell.\n\n"}

Also as statistically most branch instructions will be taken it makes sense to assume this will always be the case.\n\nBecause of the speculation involved slipstream processors are generally described as having two parallel executing streams. One is an optimized faster A-stream executing the reduced code, the other is the slower R-stream which runs behind the A-stream and executes the full code. The R-stream runs faster than if it were a single stream due to data being prefetched by the A-stream effectively hiding memory latency, and due to the A-stream's assistance with branch prediction. The two streams both complete faster than a single stream would. As of 2005, theoretical studies have shown that this configuration can lead to a speedup of around 20%.\n\nThe main problem with this approach is accuracy: as the A-stream becomes more accurate and less speculative, the overall system runs slower. Furthermore, a large enough distance is needed between the A-stream and the R-stream so that cache misses generated by the A-stream do not slow down the R-stream.\n\n"}

His efforts to simplify and modernise Bengali prose were significant. He also rationalised and simplified the Bengali alphabet and type, which had remained unchanged since Charles Wilkins and Panchanan Karmakar had cut the first (wooden) Bengali type in 1780.\n\nHe was the most prominent campaigner for Hindu widow remarriage and petitioned Legislative council despite severe opposition and a counter petition against the proposal with nearly four times more signatures by Radhakanta Deb and the Dharma Sabha. But Lord Dalhousie personally finalised the bill despite the opposition and it being considered a flagrant breach of Hindu customs as prevalent then and the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 was passed.\n\nHe received the title \"\"Vidyasagar\"\" (in Sanskrit \"Vidya\" means knowledge and \"Sagar\" means ocean, i.e., Ocean of Knowledge) from Sanskrit College, Calcutta (from where he graduated), due to his excellent performance in Sanskrit studies and philosophy. Noted Cambridge mathematician Anil Kumar Gain founded Vidyasagar University, named in his honour.\n\nIn 2004, Vidyasagar was ranked number 9 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.\n\nIshwar Chandra Bandyopadhyay was born in a Bengali Hindu Brahmin family to Thakurdas Bandyopadhyay and Bhagavati Devi at Birsingha village in Hooghly district; later, the village was added to Midnapore district which is in the Ghatal subdivision of Paschim Midnapore district in current day West Bengal on 26 September 1820. At the age of 9, he went to Calcutta and started living in Bhagabat Charan's house in Burrabazar, where Thakurdas had already been staying for some years. Ishwar felt at ease amidst Bhagabat's large family and settled down comfortably in no time. Bhagabat's youngest daughter Raimoni's motherly and affectionate feelings towards Ishwar touched him deeply and had a strong influence on his later revolutionary work towards the upliftment of women's status in India.\n\nHis quest for knowledge was so intense that he used to study under a street light as it was not possible for him to afford a gas lamp at home He cleared all the examinations with excellence and in quick succession. He was rewarded with a number of scholarships for his academic performance. To support himself and the family, Ishwar Chandra also took a part-time job of teaching at Jorashanko. Ishwar Chandra joined the Sanskrit College, Calcutta and studied there for twelve long years and passed out of the college in 1841 qualifying in Sanskrit Grammar, Literature, Dialectics [Alankara Shastra], Vedanta, Smriti and Astronomy As was the custom then Ishwar Chandra married at the age of fourteen. His wife was Dinamayee Devi. Narayan Chandra Bandyopadhyaya was their only son.\n\nIn the year 1839, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar successfully cleared his Sanskrit law examination. In 1841, at the age of twenty-one years, Ishwar Chandra joined Fort William College as head of the Sanskrit department.\n\nAfter five years, in 1846, Vidyasagar left Fort William College and joined the Sanskrit College as 'Assistant Secretary'. In the first year of service, Ishwar Chandra recommended a number of changes to the existing education system. This report resulted in a serious altercation between Ishwar Chandra and College Secretary Rasomoy Dutta. In 1849, he against the advice of Rasomoy Dutta, resigned from Sanskrit College and rejoined Fort William College as a head clerk.\nHe resided at what is known today as Vidyasagar Smriti Mandir at 36 Vidysagar Street in North Kolkata.\n\nVidyasagar established Barisha High School in Kolkata in 1856 by Amulya Ambati, the reformer.\n\nVidyasagar championed the upliftment of the status of women in India, particularly in his native Bengal. Unlike some other reformers who sought to set up alternative societies or systems, he sought to transform society from within.\n\nWith support from people like Akshay Kumar Dutta, Vidyasagar introduced the practice of widow remarriages to mainstream Hindu society. His son named Narayanchandra married a widow lady. The prevailing custom of Kulin Brahmin polygamy allowed elderly men – sometimes on their deathbeds – to marry teenage or prepubescent girls, supposedly to spare their parents the shame of having an unmarried girl attain puberty in their house. After such marriages, these girls would usually be left behind in their parental homes, especially if they were subsequently widowed. These included a semi-starvation, hard domestic labour and close restriction on their freedom of leaving the house or being seen by strangers.\n\nUnable to tolerate the ill-treatment, many of these girls would run away and turn to prostitution to support themselves. Ironically, the economic prosperity and lavish lifestyles of the city made it possible for many of them to have successful careers once they stepped out of the sanction of society and into the demi-monde. In 1853 it was estimated that Calcutta had a population of 12,718 prostitutes and public women. Many widows had to shave their heads and don white saris, supposedly to discourage attention from men. They led a deplorable life, something Vidyasagar thought was unfair and sought to change.\n\nThe Wood’s despatch of 1854—considered the Magna Carta of Indian education—adopted a new policy towards 'mass education'. Hitherto the official focus was on the upper classes of population for education. Dubbed the 'Downward Filtration Theory', this implied that education always filters down from the upper classes of the society to the common masses.\n\nIn 1859, the government’s education policy reiterated \"the spread of vernacular elementary instruction among the lower orders\". Upon this, Vidyasagar addressed a letter, dated 29 September 1859, to John Peter Grant, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, underlining his perception:\"An impression appears to have gained ground, both here and in England, that enough has been done for the education of the higher classes and that attention should now be directed towards the education of the masses... An enquiry into the matter will, however, show a very different state of things. As the best, if not the only practicable means of promoting education in Bengal, the Government should, in my humble opinion, confine itself to the education of the higher classes on a comprehensive scale.\"The words \"higher classes\" in Bengali parlance do not entail anything but caste which bestows or withdraws the privilege of education on a person by birth. Thus, Vidyasagar explicitly advocated for confining education to \"higher classes\".\n\nEarlier in 1854, Vidyasagar had scoffed at the admission of a wealthy man from the goldsmith caste of Bengal in the Sanskrit College, Calcutta. His argument was that \"in the scale of castes, the class (goldsmith or Subarnabanik) stands very low\". Notably, Sanjib Chattopadhyay, a biographer of Vidyasagar, revealed that Ishwar Chandra started his primary education in a school established and maintained by Shibcharan Mallick, a rich man of goldsmith caste in Calcutta.\n\nHe reconstructed the Bengali alphabet and simplified Bengali typography into an alphabet (actually abugida) of twelve vowels and forty consonants, eliminating the Sanskrit phonemes ৠ (re), and ঔ (ou) and a few punctuation marks, while adding three new letters, ড় (ṛô), ঢ় (ṛhô), and য় (yô), to reflect contemporary pronunciation. Vidyasagar also removed ৱ (wô) although native, as it had merged with ব (bô) in his own dialect (The distinction still exists in eastern dialects even though the letter does not). He contributed significantly to Bengali and Sanskrit literature, with one of his works, \"Bôrṇô Pôrichôy\" (\"Character Identification\"), being considered a classic.\n\n\nVidyasagar was liberal in his outlook even though he was born in an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family. Also, he was highly educated and influenced by Oriental thoughts and ideas. Ramakrishna in contrast, did not have a formal education. Yet they had a nice relation between them. When Ramakrishna met Vidyasagar, he praised Vidyasagar as the ocean of wisdom. Vidyasagar joked that Ramkrishna should have collected some amount of salty water of that sea. But, Ramakrishna, with profound humbleness & respect, replied that the water of general sea might be salty, but not the water of the sea of wisdom.\n\nThe Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna reveals the fact that Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, born and brought up in a conservative Hindu family, had taken up agnosticism personally, on being moved by the suffering of the people. He stated to Ramakrishna that if God is just and merciful, then why didn't He prevent the ruthless killing of innocent people at the hands of Genghis Khan.\n\nMahendranath Gupta popular by the pseudonym of M, who was the creator of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, was the headmaster of the Metropolitan School, established by Vidyasagar. In the year 1886, when Sri Ramakrishna was on his deathbed in Cossipore, ailing with cancer, M would frequently visit him and sometimes spent the night there too along with his wife, who was also devoted to Sri Ramakrishna after attending to his duties as headmaster. That year, the students of the school didn't score well in the Entrance Examination. Vidyasagar summoned M & insulted him by saying that his frequent visits to Sri Ramakrishna were having an adverse effect on the academic results of the school and its students. In protest, M sent his resignation letter the very next day. Ramakrishna supported M's decision.\n\nShortly after Vidyasagar's death, Rabindranath Tagore reverently wrote about him: \"One wonders how God, in the process of producing forty million Bengalis, produced a man!\"\n\nAfter death, he is remembered in many ways, some of them include:\n\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar spent the last 18 to 20 years of his life among the Santhals at Nandan Kanan, \"Karmatar\" in the District of Jamtara, Jharkhand. The station Karmatar has been renamed as \"Vidyasagar' railway station\" in his honour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2083487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083487", "title": "The Eliminators", "text": "The Eliminators\n\nThe Eliminators were a professional wrestling tag team that consisted of Perry Saturn and John Kronus who were best known for their time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) between 1995 and 1997.\n\nWhile working as the manager of a nightclub in Boston, Perry Satullo met bouncer George Caiazzo, who expressed an interest in becoming a wrestler. Satullo sent Caiazzo to Killer Kowalski's school to train, and then offered to form a tag team with him. Satullo took the name Saturn, after the Roman god of agriculture and the harvest, and Caiazzo took the name of Saturn's Greek equivalent Cronus, with the spelling slightly altered as \"Kronus\". Satullo proposed that the team be known as \"The Harvesters of Sorrow\" due to the significance of their ring names, but promoter Jerry Lawler advised Satullo that the significance would not be evident to many fans. The team then became known as \"The Eliminators\".\n\nThe Eliminators wrestled their first match together at a United States Wrestling Association house show in 1993. They were hired at a starting salary of $40 a week, and shared an apartment with Brendan Shanahan and James Lewis. After working with the USWA for a while, gaining experience as a team the two managed to negotiate a 100% pay rise. The team's first brush with tag-team gold came when they made it all the way to the finals of a tournament to crown new USWA Tag Team Champions but lost in the finals to Brian Christopher and Saturn's mentor \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert in April 1994. The team kept pursuing the titles and a few weeks later on May 2, 1994 Saturn and Kronus beat Christopher and Gilbert for the titles.\n\nThe Eliminators held the gold for about 6 weeks until they came up against PG-13 on June 13, 1994 who beat them for the titles. The Eliminators stuck around the USWA for the remainder of 1994 working both as a tag-team and in individual competition.\n\nIn 1995, Saturn and Kronus branched out and traveled to Japan to work for the Japanese promotion WAR. On one WAR card they tangled with wrestling legends Mil Máscaras, Bob Backlund and Jimmy Snuka.\n\nDuring their tour of Japan the compactly-built and heavily tattooed Saturn and the high-flying Kronus caught the attention of booker Paul Heyman. Heyman signed the two with Extreme Championship Wrestling when they were originally brought in to job to the Steiner Brothers when he thought they were staying with the company for a lengthy period, however they would later defeat The Steiner Brothers and Taz at Gangstas Paradise on September 16, 1995. Heyman initially planned on giving the Eliminators a sadomasochism gimmick and but soon changed his mind and presented the duo as an unstoppable force ala The Road Warriors. He also gave them a manager, Jason Knight, to compensate for their weak interview skills.\n\nThe Eliminators started a violent feud with The Pitbulls whom they clashed with repeatedly between October 1995 and April 1996 losing to them at the supercard \"November To Remember '95\" although they would defeat them in rematches at \"December to Dismember\" and \"Holiday Hell\".\n\nDuring their feud, the teams clashed in both in regular tag-team competition such as during \"December To Dismember\" when teaming with Raven, Stevie Richards and The Heavenly Bodies in an Ultimate Jeopardy Steel Cage match against the Pitbulls, Public Enemy and Tommy Dreamer on December 9, 1995. After The Pitbulls' manager Francine cut Saturn's hair, he shaved his head completely in a homage to Mickey Knox, the character depicted by Woody Harrelson in \"Natural Born Killers\" (in reality, Saturn was beginning to go bald).\n\nOn February 2, 1996 the Eliminators beat Cactus Jack and Mikey Whipwreck to win the ECW World Tag Team Championship at a house show in Queens, New York. After disposing of the longtime rivals the Pitbulls at \"Big Ass Extreme Bash\" on March 8 (although the team defeated the Pitbulls in later house shows), the Eliminators were targeted by The Gangstas setting off a bloody feud between the two teams facing them in a 6-man tag team match with Brian Lee against The Gangstas and Tommy Dreamer at \"A Matter of Respect\" and later faced them in title defences at \"Fight The Power\" and \"Hardcore Heaven '96\", the latter a resulting in a no contest.\n\nOn August 13, 1996 the Gangstas beat the Eliminators for the tag-team titles in a four corners elimination match with the Bruise Brothers and the Samoan Gangsta Party at the supercard \"The Doctor Is In\" and, although defeated in subsequent rematches, The Gangstas managed to hold on to the gold until the Eliminators regained the titles at a house show in Middletown, New York on December 20, 1996.\n\nAs the Eliminators/Gangstas feud continued into 1997, another team entered the fray making it a three way between the Eliminators, the Gangstas and The Dudley Boyz. After defenses against teams such as Axl Rotten and D-Von Dudley and Sabu and Rob Van Dam, the Dudley Boys won the tag-team titles from the Eliminators at \"Hostile City Showdown\" on March 15, 1997 only to lose them back to the Eliminators at ECW's first PPV \"Barely Legal\" on April 13, 1997.\n\nOn May 31, 1997 in Trenton, New Jersey, during a three-way dance with the Dudley Boyz and PG-13, Saturn tore his ACL when he landed on a crutch while executing a kick on Big Dick Dudley. Despite the injury, Saturn continued to compete and defeated the Dudley Boyz at \"Wrestlepalooza '97\" and Kronus continued defending the title in handicap matches against the F.B.I before Saturn competed in a match that saw the Eliminators drop the tag-team titles back to the Dudley Boyz at a house show in Waltham, Massachusetts on June 20, 1997.\n\nAfter intense reconstructive surgery, Saturn was given a recovery time of as much as a year. He began rehabilitating after two months and returned to action in August although in a diminished capacity due to his knee problems. Saturn had become impatient with what he regarded as Kronus' lack of motivation and dedication, and refused to reform the Eliminators. Paul Heyman offered to release him from his contract if he could find alternate employment. Saturn entered into negotiations with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and signed a contract with them while not being 100% recovered from his knee injury.\n\nAfter Saturn left, Kronus began teaming with various wrestlers, including former enemy New Jack to form The Gangstanators but never achieved the same success as he did together with Saturn.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This property included the home of Samuel Bowles of the founding family of the \"Springfield Daily Republican\" which was transformed into a classroom building known as Main House. The school property once adjacent to a park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted was transformed and renamed The MacDuffie School, an all-girls college preparatory school. It was located on a 15-acre campus in the middle of Springfield's Maple Hill neighborhood of tree-lined streets, and with landscaped grounds of late 19th- and early 20th century mansions that were once homes to Springfield's leading industrialists and businessmen. Fashioned after their alma maters, MacDuffie provided young women the same access to excellence in education the MacDuffies experienced at Harvard and Radcliffe. A suffragist and believer in civil rights, Abby MacDuffie instilled a sense of curiosity about the world, equality for all, and progressive thinking in her students that remains at the school’s core today.\n\nIn 1936 their son Malcolm and his wife Margaret took over as Heads, but he chose to pursue a different career and they sold the school in 1941 at the beginning of World War II, to Ralph and Cleminette Rutenber. The Rutenbers (1941–1972) extended both the reputation of the school and the campus itself, acquiring the athletic field and several large homes on the south side of Central Street and Ames Hill Drive and constructing Rutenber Hall (the school’s main classroom/library facility) and Downing Gymnasium in 1963. Under the Rutenber’s leadership, the school enjoyed its largest enrollments in the 1960s and 70s, reaching 360 boarding and day students from all over the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe legacy of the MacDuffie and the Rutenber years of leadership, however, lies chiefly in the intellectual ideals they instilled through their vision and care.\n\nIn 1990, the year of the MacDuffie Centennial, the school became coeducational and the traditional girls' boarding program became the Ames Hill family-style program, primarily for international students, who resided with house parents in the historic homes on Ames Hill. Under the tenure of Head Michael L. Cornog (1988–1999), the school also added a sixth grade to create a fully integrated middle school curriculum.\n\nIn December 2010 the school's board of trustees announced that the NY-based International EC LLC acquired the school's name, mission, and intellectual property. EC International moved the school from Springfield to the former St. Hyacinth Seminary campus in Granby MA, which was purchased to continue the school’s mission. Faculty, staff, and students moved to the new Granby MacDuffie campus in 2011.\n\nOn June 1, 2011, five days before graduation in the school's final year in Springfield, the school's campus on Ames Hill Drive was devastated by a rare EF3 tornado that tore through several neighborhoods in the city and surrounding towns. Many student, faculty and staff were present on the campus at the time of the tornado and while there were no injuries, the campus was severely damaged with most of its trees uprooted as well as damage to buildings.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, MacDuffie School relocated and opened in Granby where it continues to operate. Stephen Griffin was appointed as the Head of School and continues to serve as such.\n\nThe MacDuffie School now offers students a much larger campus with enhanced classroom space, boarding facilities, greater technology and athletic fields. In July 2015, MMI Holdings, a Delaware education management company, purchased EC International.\n\n\n"}

The group originally started as a three-man group with D'Lo Brown in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), before evolving into a four-man group with Killer Kyle.\n\nThe Gangstas was formed by New Jack and Mustafa Saed in North Georgia Wrestling Alliance in 1994. They would win their Tag Team Championship, but quickly vacated them upon leaving the promotion that July.\n\nUpon arriving in Smoky Mountain Wrestling in July 1994 alongside D-Lo Brown, they would cut promos about activist Medgar Evers and O.J. Simpson to infuriate the southern white crowd. They would use fried chicken and watermelons as props and win matches as a result of a two count (rather than the conventional three count), purportedly due to Affirmative Action. Ring announcers would, on more than one occasion, confuse their hometown as being Louisiana (LA) instead of Los Angeles (L.A.) which would entice New Jack to verbally abuse the announcer. Killer Kyle would join the Gangstas in March 1995 during their feud with Jim Cornette and Bob Armstrong. They would primarily feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, The Thugs, and PG-13.\n\nNew Jack and Mustafa left SMW in June 1995, in a controversial fashion, which escalated the long-standing dispute between Paul Heyman and Jim Cornette. In ECW, the now two-man team were known for bringing weapons such as guitars, crutches and staple guns to the ring in trash cans and shopping carts, while the song \"Natural Born Killaz\" would play through their matches. In a distinct difference from SMW, they were embraced as heroes by the northeastern crowd, and the team went on to hold the ECW World Tag Team Championship two times.\n\nThe team split in 1997 when Mustafa left ECW. New Jack found a new partner in John Kronus of The Eliminators, who like New Jack was left without a partner after the other half of The Eliminators, Perry Saturn, left ECW. Kronus and New Jack became known as The Gangstanators (a portmanteau of Gangstas and Eliminators) and held the ECW World Tag Team Championship once. With Mustafa gone, New Jack went on to greater fame, continuing to use the Gangsta gimmick. New Jack became a surprise attraction at Pay-Per-Views, and was known for answering open challenges by heels and doing run-ins to save babyfaces with his various weapons, to the crowd's delight. In 1999, The two former teammates began a feud when Mustafa returned for a brief while.\n\nOn May 24, 2008, the Gangstas reunited for the first time in over 10 years at Xtreme Pro Wrestling's \"Cold Day in Hell\" in a match against the Westside NGZ.\n\nOn August 8, 2010, the team made an appearance at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, assaulting Team 3D and Joel Gertner after a match. After the beatdown, Team 3D, The Gangsta's, Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten celebrated in the ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2083523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083523", "title": "Nosgoth", "text": "Nosgoth\n\nNosgoth was a free-to-play multiplayer action game, developed by Psyonix and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows through digital distribution. It was a spin-off from the \"Legacy of Kain\" series of action-adventure games, and took place in its eponymous fictional universe. \"Nosgoth\" employed a player versus player system in which each match consisted of two rounds. Teams were composed of characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; and humans, whose gameplay was styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams would switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulated the most points by fighting their counterparts won the match.\n\nInitially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, \"Nosgoth\" was the first \"Legacy of Kain\"-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's \"\". Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, \"\", it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following \"Dead Sun\"'s cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, \"Nosgoth\" attracted negative reception for its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven \"Legacy of Kain\" formula. The game's open beta began in January 2015 and ended in May 2016.\n\nOn April 8, 2016, Square Enix Europe announced that \"Nosgoth's\" servers would shut down on May 31, 2016. \"Nosgoth's\" official forums also shut down on June 14, 2016.\n\n\"Nosgoth\" was an asymmetrical online multiplayer third-person shooter. \"Nosgoth's\" gameplay focuses on melee Vampire characters against the ranged Human characters. Gameplay consists of two modes: Deathmatch in which The Vampires and Humans fight against each other to get a higher kill-count than the opposing team. If the killcount reaches a threshold, the team that reached it wins. Or time runs out, the team with the higher kills wins, and Flashpoint: offshoot of traditional Domination modes that tasks Humans with capturing a series of control points in the map. Two points are initially available, chosen at random, and when one point is captured, another appears. Humans have a limited amount of time to complete their mission, but each successful capture adds time to the clock, extending the match. Vampires win if they can prevent captures long enough for the match timer to run out.\n\nBoth team types use a character class-based system, meaning there are different vampires and humans that have varying different roles. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, as Vampires rely on surprise attacks. Both teams possess abilities, which can be activated having cooldown periods when used, or are passive/innately active. Vampires have the ability to fly and climb buildings, humans are grounded and do not get to experience this trait. The Humans rely on weaponry, and projectile-based ranged attacks, such as crossbows. They have ammunition that can be depleted, which can then be refilled at ammunition stations. Vampires being melee, will have very different ways to attack, such as pouncing on top of a human and clawing at them, making them unable to act as they are knocked down, or being grabbed by a flying-based Vampire and dropped into more Vampires.\n\nAfter the execution of Raziel in \"\", Kain used the Chronoplast - a time-streaming device - to advance to his return, seemingly abandoning his empire. With the resulting power vacuum, the vampire clans of the empire fell against each other in a bloody civil war that nearly wiped out Raziel's clan. With the vampires occupied by their own internal struggles, humanity slowly became resurgent as escapees and free humans united to rebuild their shattered civilization.\n\nReconstructing cities and defences, and building themselves into a legitimate fighting force, the humans came to occupy a swath of southern Nosgoth. Attacks on key territories under vampire control eventually alerted the vampires to the danger posed by their former slaves and prompted the co-operation of the vampire clans in the face of the new threat - and a new war began for control of land of Nosgoth.\n\nAfter the release of \"\" in 2003, it emerged that a sixth \"Legacy of Kain\" game had entered development at Ritual Entertainment in 2004, but was canceled before being publicly revealed. In 2013, speculation concerning the existence of another new \"Legacy of Kain\" project began with the discovery that series publisher Square Enix had registered the domain name warfornosgoth.com, thereby making reference to Nosgoth, the fictional setting of the series. The \"Official Xbox Magazine\" subsequently revealed evidence that Passion Pictures artist Richard Buxton had worked on a \"Legacy of Kain\" \"animation pitch\" in 2011; Buxton responded with the comment, \"I'm not allowed to talk about that\". In May 2013, an Advanced Micro Devices patch log and a profile on the Steam database were found to contain further references to an upcoming title named \"War for Nosgoth\" or \"Nosgoth\". Additionally, the LinkedIn profile of video game composer Kevin Riepl referred to a project named \"Nosgoth\", citing Square Enix as its publisher and Psyonix Games as its developer.\n\nIn early June 2013, Square Enix London Studios community manager George Kelion responded to the leaks and ensuing fan speculation by confirming the existence and ongoing development of the \"Nosgoth\" project to VG247 and Eurogamer, saying \"it feels weird to have a bunch of info out there and we don't want the community to get the wrong idea\". He clarified that \"Nosgoth\" was set in the same universe as previous \"Legacy of Kain\" titles, but that it was \"not a traditional or even single-player LoK experience\". and that \"it's very much on a separate branch to both the and series\". Kelion further stated that long-time \"Legacy of Kain\" developers Crystal Dynamics were not involved in the project, and that \"Nosgoth\" would be officially announced, and properly revealed, at a later date, beyond the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013.\n\nIn late June 2013, \"Legacy of Kain\" fan Mama Robotnik posted evidence from sources at Climax Studios, that \"Nosgoth\" had originated as a primarily single-player, story-based game, named \"Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun\". The project had allegedly been under development between 2009 and 2012 by Climax Studios with supervision from Crystal Dynamics, and was intended as a PlayStation 4 launch title. Its multiplayer mode, developed by Psyonix Games, reportedly became \"Nosgoth\" after the single-player component of the game was canceled by Square Enix in 2012, who projected that it would fail to meet sales expectations. Kelion responded by confirming that \"Dead Sun\" existed and that \"Nosgoth\" was intended to be its multiplayer companion game, but said Nosgoth is a separate project which has \"grown in size and scope since its initial conception\", featuring \"different mechanics, characters, levels and gameplay\". He rejected the idea that it is \"\"the multiplayer component of Dead Sun pulled out and fleshed out\"\".\n\nAccording to Kelion, \"Nosgoth\" is not a reboot, a mobile game, an open world game, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), or a real-time strategy game, nor is it \"best described as a MOBA game\" (multiplayer online battle arena). It derives influences from the second game in the series, \"\", and is played from a third-person viewpoint. It was set to be available on Microsoft Windows as a download-only title. In March 2016, Square Enix and Psyonix announced that the game would leave early access very soon. However, on April 8, 2016, Square Enix announced that they had cancelled the game as it had failed to captivate a broad audience.\n\n\"GameSpot\" Cameron Woolsey rated the game 6/10, praising its entertaining gameplay and detailed environments, but citing a lack of content, balance concerns, technical problems and discontinuity with the \"Legacy of Kain\" series as faults.\n\n"}
{"id": "2083524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083524", "title": "Nation of shopkeepers", "text": "Nation of shopkeepers\n\nThe phrase \"a nation of shopkeepers\", commonly attributed to Napoleon, is a reference to England or the United Kingdom. \n\nThere is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it. No contemporaneous French newspaper mentions that he did. The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac on 11 June 1794 in a speech to the National Convention: “Let Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers”. Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to “the French” or to Napoleon himself. \n\nA later, explicit source is Barry Edward O'Meara, who was surgeon to Napoleon during his exile in St. Helena. If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said:\n\nThe supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (\"une nation de boutiquiers\") is frequently cited, but it has no attestation. O'Meara conversed with Napoleon in Italian, not French. There is no other source.\n\nAfter the war English newspapers sometimes tried to correct the impression. For example the following article appeared in the \"Morning Post\" of 28 May 1832:\nENGLAND A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS\nThis complimentary term, for so we must consider it, as applied to a Nation which has derived its principal prosperity from its commercial greatness, has been erroneously attributed, from time to time, to all the leading Revolutionists of France. To our astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE. Than this nothing can be further from the fact. NAPOLEON was scarcely known at the time, he being merely an Officer of inferior rank, totally unconnected with politics. The occasion on which that splenetic, but at the same time, complimentary observation was made was that of the ever-memorable battle of the 1st of June. The oration delivered on that occasion was by M. BARRERE [sic], in which, after describing our beautiful country as one \"on which the sun scarce designs to shed its light\", he described England as a nation of shopkeepers.\n\nIn any case the phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Barère. It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776) by Adam Smith, who wrote: \n\nSmith is also quoted as saying that Britain was \"a nation that is governed by shopkeepers\", which is how he put it in the first (1776) edition. It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise.\n\nThe phrase may have been part of standard 18th-century economic dialogue. It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase. But this presupposes that Napoleon himself, as opposed to Barère alone, used the phrase.\n\nThe phrase has also been attributed to Samuel Adams, but this is disputed; Josiah Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, produced a slightly different phrase in 1766:\n\nNapoleon would have been correct in seeing the United Kingdom as essentially a commercial and naval rather than a land based power, but during his lifetime it was fast being transformed from a mercantile to an industrial nation, a process which laid the basis for a century of British hegemony after the Battle of Waterloo. Although the UK had half the population of France during the Napoleonic Wars, there was a higher per capita income and, consequently, a greater tax base, necessary to conduct a prolonged war of attrition. The United Kingdom's economy and its ability to finance the war against Napoleon also benefitted from the Bank of England's issuance of inconvertible banknotes, a \"temporary\" measure which remained from the 1790s until 1821.\n\n"}

Hertzler\n\nJohn Garman Hertzler Jr. (born March 18, 1950) is an American actor, author, screenwriter, and activist best known for his role on \"\" as the Klingon General (and later Chancellor) Martok, whom he portrayed from 1995 until the series' end in 1999.\n\nHertzler began his acting career in the 1970s, doing mostly stage acting and appearing in some films. He guest starred in a few episodes for different television shows before landing the part of Alcalde Ignacio De Soto in the early 1990s show \"Zorro\". In addition to \"Deep Space Nine\", Hertzler has appeared on several other \"Star Trek\" shows, written two \"Star Trek\" novels, and has made appearances at \"Star Trek\" and science fiction conventions. Hertzler lives in the Finger Lakes region of New York where he was a lecturer at Cornell's theater department, and has been active in the area's regional politics, as well as writing a screenplay.\n\nHertzler was born in Savannah, Georgia. His parents were from Port Royal, Pennsylvania, and his family is descended from German-speaking Amish families. His father John G. Hertzler served in the U.S. Air Force, and his mother Eleanor Frances Beaver Hertzler was a Latin and French teacher. His family lived in cities around the world including: St. Joe, Missouri; El Paso, Texas; and Casablanca in Morocco. He grew up mostly in the Washington, D.C. area, and attended Bucknell University, playing linebacker on their football squad. While there, he got into acting when the drama department recruited him for a production of \"Marat/Sade\" as they were looking for a big guy for one of the roles. After graduating in political science in 1972, he got his master's in set design at the University of Maryland, and attended law school for a year at American University. While he was in the DC area, he worked in the federal government, including with the Nixon Administration for the National Environmental Policy Act, and took an assortment of jobs to practice theatre including waiting at a dinner theater, bartending, and taxi-driving.\n\nHertzler worked in the Washington area on theatre projects. On the movie screen, he portrayed Lucas in the horror film \"\" (also known as \"Class Reunion Massacre\"), which was released in 1978. Hertzler also had a role in the feature film \"And Justice for All\" which starred Al Pacino, released in 1979. He also worked in New York City on the Broadway production \"The Bacchae\" as King Pentheus. In 1981, he moved to San Francisco to join the American Conservatory Theater (ACT) where he acted and directed in a number of productions including \"The Admirable Crichton\", \"Richard II\", \"Dial M for Murder\", and a number of Shakespeare productions. He was an instructor with ACT, and had also worked with other theater productions such as \"Medea\" with the Cincinnati Playhouse. He moved to Southern California in 1988 and continued theatre work there.\nHis first notable guest role on television was in 1990 on the \"Quantum Leap\" episode \"The Sea Bride – June 3, 1954\". His first major television role was in the 1990s series \"Zorro\" as Alcalde Ignacio De Soto, the antagonist character who replaces Ramone as the Alcalde (Mayor) of Los Angeles in the third and fourth seasons. The show was filmed in a studio lot outside of Madrid, Spain, and was broadcast on The Family Channel. He was also involved in a television movie called \"Treasure Island: The Adventure Begins\" where he played a pirate called Black Dog. \"Treasure Island\" was broadcast to go along with a promotion for the casino resort in Las Vegas.\n\nHertzler's first involvement in \"\" was in the series' pilot episode \"\" as the Vulcan captain of the Federation starship \"Saratoga\". In an interview with Startrek.com, Hertzler said he had worked with Patrick Stewart at the Paramount Studios lot where Stewart ran some Shakespeare workshops. He would later audition for \"DS9\" multiple times, but did not receive any roles. He was at the Paramount Studios auditioning for another series when \"DS9\" casting director Ron Surma had him read for Klingon General Martok. At first, Hertzler portrayed Martok as a mild-mannered Klingon, but when he was asked to make him angrier, he picked up a chair and threw it into a wall. The chair's leg stuck briefly and he said he had also inadvertently ripped his thumbnail causing it to bleed, but it had impressed the auditors and he landed the part.\n\nMartok debuted in the season 4 premiere \"\" followed by the season 5 premiere \"Apocalypse Rising\". His character was originally a changeling (shapeshifter) Dominion impostor. Hertzler said the writers chose Martok to be the changeling, because they thought that making the Klingon Chancellor Gowron to be a clone was \"too pat or too easy.\" After the Martok changeling was killed in the episode Apocalypse Rising, the writers then brought in the real Martok as a recurring character starting in season 5, during which he portrayed a one-eyed Klingon. He would play Martok for three seasons including the finale, by which time he had replaced Gowron as the leader of the Klingon Empire. Hertzler describes the part as an actor's dream because of its physicality and range. The character has been involved in many aspects of \"Deep Space Nine\" including frequently interacting with Worf.\nHertzler played other characters in \"DS9\", including a changeling named Laas, in the episode \"\", who interacts with main character Odo. In an interview with Little Review, Hertzler said that he was concerned he would be recognized as Martok despite the makeup and character change, but it worked out okay. Credited as Garman Hertzler for the episode, he said that he got a chance to interact with some of the lead characters that Martok would not encounter, especially the ones played by Nana Visitor and René Auberjonois. In portraying Laas, Hertzler said he tried to act like William Shatner, but with a higher pitch. Another guest character he did was Roy Ritterhouse, a painter/sketcher in the season 6 episode \"Far Beyond the Stars\".\n\nFollowing the end of \"DS9\", Hertzler played a Hirogen in the \"\" episode \"\", which was noted for featuring pro wrestler Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. In the episode, he and The Rock are conscripted alien fighters. Hertzler said that he also got to wrestle actress Jeri Ryan who played Seven of Nine. In \"\", he played a Klingon lawyer in the episode \"\" and a Klingon Captain in the episode \"\". He made appearances at \"Star Trek\" and science fiction conventions and events. In 2015, Hertzler joined the cast on the fan-funded short film \"\" as Captain Samuel Travis of the Federation.\n\nOutside of the \"Star Trek\" world, Hertzler appeared in the television film \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\" where he portrayed director Ridley Scott. He made guest appearances on \"Six Feet Under\", \"Roswell\", \"Charmed\", and \"\".\n\nIn 1995–96, he was involved in a national tour for the stage theatre production of \"Dial M for Murder\", in which he portrayed Max Halliday, an American writer who gets involved in a love triangle.\nHertzler has been involved in voice-over for video games and audio productions. Outside some \"Star Trek\" titles, he did the voice-over for the intro sequence of 3DO's \"Might and Magic IX\", and was the voice of Dr. Grossman in \"BioShock\" and Deathstroke and Ares in \"\". Hertzler narrated the audio book entitled \"Barsk: The Elephants' Graveyard\", written by Star Trek linguist Lawrence Schoen.\n\nDuring the 2005–2006 season, Hertzler played the role of Henry Drummond in productions of \"Inherit the Wind\" at Geva Theatre Center and Cornell University's Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nIn 2007, Hertzler moved to Ulysses, New York, and became a Resident Professional Teaching Associate (RPTA) in the Cornell University Department of Theatre, Film & Dance, where he has directed or performed in a number of productions through the 2010 season. In 2009, Hertzler directed an outdoor production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for the Ithaca Shakespeare Company at the F.R. Newman Arboretum. He also portrayed Lord Capulet in Cornell's production of \"Romeo and Juliet\", which involved students as well as professional actors.\n\nAfter Cornell, Hertzler has continued to do acting and teaching in the New York area, including hosting a workshop about Shakespeare acting.\n\nHertzler co-authored with novelist Jeffrey Lang two \"Star Trek\" novels, \"Left Hand of Destiny, Book 1\", and \"Left Hand of Destiny, Book 2\". which were published by Simon & Schuster. The novels follow Martok's and Worf's adventures following \"Deep Space Nine\" as they return to Q'onoS, with much of the focus on Martok's life.\n\nHertzler has also written an original screenplay, \"Dancing with Sancho Panza\", inspired by his time in Spain when he worked on \"Zorro\". In June 2016, the announcement was made that the screenplay will be directed by Luis Mandoki with an anticipated release date of November 2017.\n\nIn 2013, Hertzler ran for a position on the Ulysses town council. His involvement in politics was partly because of the issue of hydraulic fracturing and concerns that the method of drilling for natural gas would destroy the Finger Lakes region. He also wanted the region's schools to get more state aid. He was elected and served on the board for a two-year term. In 2016, he was elected to the town council board for a four-year term extending to 2020.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Hertzler endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President.\n\nHertzler and fellow \"Star Trek\" actor James Cromwell were among nineteen people arrested for disorderly conduct during a protest outside a Crestwood Midstream compressor station in Watkins Glen, New York, on June 6, 2016. They were involved in the \"We Are Seneca Lake\" civil disobedience campaign against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission green-lighting underground gas storage in Seneca Lake's salt caverns, despite public opposition.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, Hertzler announced his candidacy as a U.S. House Representative for New York's 23rd congressional district in the 2018 midterm elections. As part of his campaign appearances, he planned to act \"in the persona of Mark Twain\", to present his ideas \"through the brilliant humorist for all ages\". He stated that this was a tribute both to Twain, who resided once in Elmira, and to actor Hal Holbrook, who had portrayed Twain on stage for more than six decades. On September 25, 2017 Hertzler announced his decision to leave the Democratic Party and run as an independent. He advanced in the primary in June 2018, but later withdrew his candidacy prior to November.\n\n\n"}

It was formed September 1941 in France. It was transferred to the southern sector of the Eastern Front in March 1942. The 22nd was the last Panzer Division to be issued with the Czech-built Panzer 38(t), which was considered under-gunned, under-armoured and obsolete by 1942.\n\nOfficially formed on 25 September 1941 in France the division was initially equipped with obsolete Czech, French and German tanks.\n\nThe 22nd Panzer Division was sent to the Eastern Front in February 1942. After an initial disastrous attack on 20 March, in which the division's units lost 30-40% of their personnel, the division remained in the Crimea and took part in Manstein's Unternehmen Trappenjagd (Operation Bustard Hunt). In May 1942, the division was sent north to the Kharkov area and then took part in the 1942 summer offensive against Soviet forces in the Don River bend leading to the Battle of Stalingrad. The 22nd fought in the Battle of Rostov in July 1942.\n\nTogether with the 1st Romanian Armoured Division (equipped with the also obsolete R2, similar to Panzer 35(t)), the 22nd Panzer Division comprised the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps and was next tasked with defending the northern flank of the ill-fated German 6th Army at Stalingrad. Lieutenant General Ferdinand Heim was the corps commander.\n\nOn November 19, 1942, Operation Uranus began. The great Soviet counter-offensive encircled the German 6th Army and much of the 4th Panzer Army and smashed the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, including the 22nd Panzer Division. Many of the division's tanks had been parked in dugouts for an extended period of time and protected from the frost by straw. When the tanks were called on to respond to the Soviet offensive, many could not be started because mice had sought refuge in the straw and then in the tanks where they chewed up the insulation of electric system wires. The ability of the division to put up effective resistance was also compromised by the prior piecemeal deployment of division assets to shore up the Romanian line.\n\nAccording to Beevor, the division had as few as 30 serviceable Panzer 38t's with which to meet the onslaught of the T-34s of the Soviet 1st Tank Corps. Contradictory orders directing the panzers in two different directions only aggravated an already hopeless situation.\n\nAfter desperate fighting around the Russian town of Petshany 19–22 November 1942, the 22nd was virtually destroyed with survivors making their way southwest to and across the river Chir to join various \"ad hoc\" Kampfgruppen.

The team consisted of New Jack, formerly of The Gangstas, and John Kronus, formerly of The Eliminators, with \"Gangstanators\" being a portmanteau of the names of their respective former tag teams.\n\nNew Jack and Kronus joined forces after New Jack's partner Mustapha Saed and Kronus's partner Perry Saturn both left ECW. Their first match together was on August 21, 1997, when they defeated ECW World Tag Team Champions the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a non-title match. This led to a series of matches between the teams, during which New Jack and Kronus defeated the Dudleys for the title belts at ECW's \"As Good as it Gets\" event on September 20, 1997 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They successfully defended the belts against the Dudleys and the team of Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney over the following month. The Gangstanators held the title until October 18 of that year, when they lost to The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido and Tracy Smothers) in Philadelphia.\n\nAfter losing the title, The Gangstanators continued their feud with the Dudleys. Spike Dudley also entered the feud on the side of the New Jack and Kronus, fighting against his kayfabe brothers. He joined The Gangstanators in six-man matches and sometimes took Kronus' place as New Jack's partner. As the year went on, Kronus, New Jack, and Spike Dudley focused more on their singles careers, although they still teamed with each other on occasion.\n\nThe team eventually disbanded, with Kronus leaving ECW for Xtreme Pro Wrestling. New Jack remained in ECW, competing as a singles wrestler in ECW until the promotion declared bankruptcy in April 2001.\n\nThe Gangstanators reunited for one night at the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005. Kronus had been scheduled to reunite with Saturn, but Saturn was injured and could not attend the event. As a result, New Jack and Kronus teamed together to face The Bad Breed (Axl and Ian Rotten) in an impromptu brawl which ended when New Jack leapt from scaffolding and drove a prone Ian Rotten through a table.\n\n\n"}

After RCA was acquired by General Electric in 1986, GE began marketing sets identical to those from RCA. GE sold both RCA and GE consumer electronics lines to Thomson SA in 1988. RCA televisions with the Colortrak branding were mid-range models; positioned above the low-end XL-100 sets but below the high-end Dimensia and Colortrak 2000 sets. RCA discontinued use of the Colortrak name, replacing it with the Entertainment Series designation in the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, RCA responded to increased demand for component televisions with monitor capabilities by adding composite and S-video inputs to the Colortrak lineup. These inputs allowed owners to easily connect a stereo audio/video source, like a Video Cassette Recorder, LaserDisc player, or with use of an RCA SelectaVision CED videodisc players to the television. For example, early composite video-equipped RCA sets were to coincidentally be tuned to Non-broadcast channel 91 to display a composite video signal, if a set was equipped with more than one input, subsequent inputs are designated to channels 92 to 95, which are usually accessed from the remote control. Later models abandoned this design, favoring A/V inputs which were accessible by pressing the channel up/down buttons, or A/V inputs which were controlled by their own button.\n\nAfter Thomson SA acquired the GE and RCA brand names, they began designing a new chassis for RCA and GE televisions, which debuted in 1993 models. Instead of using a tuner module soldered to the circuit board, Thomson decided to integrate the tuner into the board itself. Due to the heating and cooling cycles of the circuit board and tuner from normal use, the solder connections between the tuner and the board would fail, causing an intermittent picture or no signal from the coaxial connector. This is easily repairable by desoldering the tuner shield and re-flowing new solder to each connection inside. After each connection has been soldered, the tuner shield can be soldered back in place.\n\n"}

For desktop applications a single source can target Mac, Linux, and Windows, with little or no modification. An example is the Lazarus IDE itself, created from a single code base and available on all major platforms including the Raspberry Pi.\n\nLazarus provides a highly visual development environment for the creation of rich user interfaces, application logic, and other supporting code artifacts, similar to Borland Delphi. Along with project management features, the Lazarus IDE also provides:\n\nLazarus uses Free Pascal as its back-end compiler. Therefore, Lazarus can theoretically be used to develop applications for all platforms supported by Free Pascal.\n\nLazarus provides a cross-platform application framework called the Lazarus Component Library (LCL), which provides a single, unified interface for programmers, with different platform-specific implementations. Using LCL, it is possible to create applications in a \"write once, compile anywhere\" manner, unless system-dependent features are used explicitly.\n\nAs Free Pascal supports cross-compiling, Lazarus applications can be cross-compiled from Windows to Linux / macOS / etc. and vice versa.\n\nApplications for embedded devices (smartphones, PDAs, routers, game consoles) can be cross-compiled from any desktop platform.\n\nThe standard application framework, Lazarus Component Library (LCL) was originally modeled after the Visual Component Library (VCL) in Delphi 6, and, unlike Delphi, is not restricted to Microsoft Windows operating systems. This is done by separating the definition of common widget classes and their widgetset-specific implementation. Each widget set is supported by providing an \"interface\" which interacts directly with the set.\n\nDevelopers can install packages that allow Lazarus to support several database management systems (DBMSes). Programs can interact with DBMSes through code or by components dropped on a form.\n\nThe following DBMSes are supported out of the box:\n\nWhile resembling Delphi in many ways, there are a few limitations regarding the performance and feature set, including:\n\nLike Free Pascal, Lazarus is free software. Different portions are distributed under different free software licenses, including GPL, LGPL, MPL, and a modified version of LGPL.\n\nSpecifically, the LCL, which is statically built into the produced executables, is licensed under a modified version of the LGPL, granting extra permissions to allow it to be statically built into the produced software, including proprietary ones.\n\nInstalling a design-time package is equivalent to linking to the IDE, thus distributing the Lazarus IDE with a GPL-incompatible design-time package (e.g. the JEDI packages, which are licensed under the Mozilla Public License) pre-installed would cause a license violation. This however does not prohibit proprietary packages from being developed with Lazarus.\n\nThe first attempt to develop a visual IDE for Free Pascal dates back to 1998, when the Megido project commenced. For various reasons this approach failed. Some of Megido's developers then started a new project based on a more flexible foundation.\n\nThe first preliminary LCL version was ready for release in 2001, and in 2003 the first beta version of Lazarus (0.9.0.3) was hosted at SourceForge. The first final Lazarus version (1.0) was released in 2012, and significantly enhanced Lazarus 1.2 with was released in 2014. More than four million downloads had been made from SourceForge as of March 2014.\n\nThe name \"Lazarus\" alludes to the revival of the Megido concept. It is inspired by Lazarus of Bethany, who, according to the Gospel of John, was restored to life by Jesus four days after his death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He made his debut on the August 18, 1990 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\" teaming with Scott Williams in a match against WCW World Tag-Team Champions Doom. He would make his singles debut against J.W. Storm on the October 27, 1990 edition of \"World Championship Wrestling\". Over the following years made appearances with the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as a jobber.\n\nIn 1994 at Smokey Mountain Wrestling, the pairing of Saed, New Jack and, for a brief time, D'Lo Brown were collectively known as The Gangstas. A controversial gimmick, the Gangstas would cut promos about activist Medgar Evers and O.J. Simpson to infuriate the southern white crowd, they would also use fried chicken and watermelons as props and would win matches via only a two count rather than the conventional three count purportedly due to Affirmative Action. The Gangstas would feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express for several months in case of the SMW Tag Team Championship which they would eventually win on October 3 but would lose the titles back the Rock 'n' Roll Express two months later. After the loss, the Gangstas would feud with teams such as Tony Anthony and Tracy Smothers and The Heavenly Bodies.

The Gangstas would enter a lengthy feud with the Public Enemy that would last until the beginning of 1996 where the Public Enemy would beat the Gangstas in a street fight. Several months later the Gangstas would feud with the Eliminators, challenging them for the ECW World Tag Team Championship on several occasions before finally winning them on August 3.

After California became one of the United States, Pico was elected to the state Assembly and Senate. He was appointed as the commanding brigadier general of the state militia during the U.S. Civil War.\n\nAndrés Pico was born in San Diego in 1810 as a first-generation Californio. He was one of several sons of José María Pico and María Eustaquia López. An older brother was Pío Pico, who twice served as governor of Alta California.\n\nIn 1845 under the law for secularization of former Church properties, his older brother Governor Pío Pico granted Andrés Pico and his associate Juan Manso a nine-year lease for the Mission San Fernando Rey de España lands, which encompassed nearly the entire San Fernando Valley. At that time a 35-year-old rancher, Andrés Pico lived in Pueblo de Los Angeles. He ran cattle on the ranch and used the mission complex as his hacienda. He gave Rómulo Pico Adobe to his son.\n\nIn 1846, to raise funds for the Mexican–American War, the Pío Pico government sold secularized mission lands. The Mission San Fernando was sold to Eulogio de Celis, who established Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. Celis returned to Spain, but his descendants stayed in California. Under the terms of secularization, the sale excluded the Mission compound and its immediate surroundings, which were reserved for Don Andrés.\n\nDuring the Mexican–American War, Andrés Pico commanded the native forces, the California Lancers, in Alta California. In 1846 Pico led an attack on forces commanded by U.S. General Stephen Watts Kearny at the fierce but inconclusive Battle of San Pasqual. He is sometimes confused with his older brother Pío Pico, who in 1847, was elected as the last Governor of Alta California. \n\nOn January 13, 1847, as the acting governor of Mexican Alta California (while his brother was in Mexico raising additional money for the fight against the United States), Andrés signed the Treaty of Cahuenga with the American commander Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Frémont, with whom he became friends.\n\nOn January 13, 1847, Andrés Pico approached the U.S. commander Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Frémont, man to man and alone. Without firing a shot, Don Andrés and Frémont agreed to the terms of the Ceasefire of Cahuenga, an informal agreement that ended the war in California, in exchange for promises of protection of California from abuses by Fremont's forces; this was confirmed by the Treaty of San Fernando, formalized at the mission. Frémont agreed to stop burning Californian ranches, stop stealing horses and cattle, and to obey the positive laws of the country. Kearny, the commanding U.S. general, heard of the Treaty, he gave his consent. Peace reigned.\n\nIn 1853, Don Andrés acquired a half interest in Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando from Eulogio de Celis; it was split along present-day Roscoe Boulevard, with his brother Pio Pico's land being the southern half of the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\nAfter statehood, in 1851, Don Andrés was elected to the California State Assembly from Los Angeles. Because of perceived anti-Californio sentiments in San Francisco, Don Andrés authored what was known as the Pico Bill in February 1859, to partition California into two states—north and south. The bill proposed to create the \"Territory of Colorado\" from the southern counties of the state. The bill passed both houses of the state legislature and was signed by the Governor John B. Weller on April 18, 1859. But the U.S. Congress never voted on the bill because of the outbreak of the Civil War. U.S. Congress approval was required before the proposed partition could be put to a vote of the people.\n\nIn 1858, Pico was commissioned as a Brigadier General in the California Militia. In 1860, he was elected by the state legislature as a California State Senator from Los Angeles. Andrés Pico's Rancho ex-Mission San Fernando was confiscated by federal decree in 1864, which said that he \"did not own and never did own\" it. Reduced to a pauper, he retired as a Californio ranchero in Los Angeles. Ex-Mission San Fernando fell into ruins until the mid-20th century, when the Roman Catholic Church conserved about one fourth of the old mission quadrangle.\n\nSince Don Andrés' death, the bulk of the old mission has never been restored. The site of the main mission buildings are now occupied by a parochial high school, including the old, monumental front facing east toward the former Fort Tejon Road. The sites of the Butterfield stagecoach stables, and the outbuildings and storage buildings of Don Andrés' ranch and hacienda, have been lost under development of the modern urban community of Mission Hills.\n\nPico married Catarina Moreno, grand daughter of Jose Cesario Moreno, Los Angeles pobladore in San Diego. Had one son Romulo, and adopted a daughter, also named Catarina.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2083588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083588", "title": "Baháʼí statistics", "text": "Baháʼí statistics\n\nSources such as \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" or the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\" have listed Baháʼí membership as over 7 million. More conservative estimates produced by the Baháʼí World News Service reports a Baháʼí membership of more than 5 million worldwide, in \"virtually every country\" and many territories. As such, the Baháʼí Faith is recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity, and the only religion to have grown faster than the population of the world in all major areas over the last century.\n\nMembership data on a relatively new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Baháʼí population is spread out and not in a majority anywhere. Populations are not assigned a Baháʼí religious adherence by birth, as is the case with other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Baháʼí Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Baháʼí Faith are known to underestimate or overinflate many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Baháʼí membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.\n\nThe official estimate of \"more than five million Baháʼís\" in the world was originally arrived at in 1991 by the Baháʼí World Centre and has not changed since. The official agencies of the religion have focused on publishing more concrete data, such as numbers of local and national spiritual assemblies, countries and territories represented, languages and tribes represented, and publishing trusts.\n\nIn the 1930s the Baháʼís of the United States and Canada began requiring new adherents to sign a declaration of faith, stating their belief in Baháʼu'lláh, the Báb, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and an understanding that there are laws and institutions to obey. The original purpose of signing a declaration card was to allow followers to apply for lawful exemption from active military service. The signature of a card later became optional in Canada, but in the US is still used for records and administrative requirements. Many countries follow the pattern of the US and Canada.\n\nOther than signing a card and being acknowledged by a Spiritual Assembly, there is no initiation or requirement of attendance to remain on the official roll sheets. Members receive regular mailings unless they request not to be contacted.\n\nThe fact that the religion is diffuse and proportionally small are major barriers to demographic research by outsiders. Even in the United States, where significant resources are dedicated to gathering data, the Baháʼí Faith is often omitted from religious surveys due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error. In some countries the Baháʼí Faith is illegal and Baháʼís endure some degree of persecution, making it difficult for even Baháʼís to maintain a count.\n\nAdherents.com, a website dedicated to collecting statistics on world religions, made the following comments about Baháʼí membership:\nMost denominations make no effort at all to maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because there may be no need for an official membership list (Baháʼís at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked.\n\n\n\nMany sources mentioning the number of Baháʼís in the world are deriving their information from just a few sources, which themselves review Baháʼí sources among many censuses and surveys. When a number is estimated for a particular year, future years are estimated based on growth rates.\n\nIn 2012 the Pew Research Center published a report on the Global Religious Landscape. Baháʼís were grouped in with the category \"Other Religions\" that included Sikhs and Zoroastrians. Pew said, \"Because of the lack of data on these faiths in many countries, the Pew Forum has not attempted to estimate the size of individual religions within this category...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the early 1960s until the late 1990s, the Baha'i population of the United States went from around 10,000 to 140,000 on official rolls, but the number of members with known addresses in 1998 was only about half the total. In recent years, the United States Baháʼí community has been releasing detailed membership statistics.\n\nBaháʼís and other sources such as official government census data or other some third party organizations can vary. Sometimes the Baháʼí sourced numbers are higher and sometimes lower. Also, census data has sometimes been criticized, as in the case of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Strauss began composition in the late summer of 1888 and completed the work on 18 November 1889. The work is dedicated to the composer's friend Friedrich Rosch.\n\nThe music depicts the death of an artist. At Strauss's request, this was described in a poem by the composer's friend Alexander Ritter as an interpretation of Death and Transfiguration, after it was composed. As the man lies dying, thoughts of his life pass through his head: his childhood innocence, the struggles of his manhood, the attainment of his worldly goals; and at the end, he receives the longed-for transfiguration \"from the infinite reaches of heaven\".\n\nStrauss conducted the premiere on 21 June 1890 at the Eisenach Festival (on the same programme as the premiere of his \"Burleske in D minor\" for piano and orchestra). He also conducted this work for his first appearance in the United Kingdom, at the Wagner Concert with the Philharmonic Society on 15 June 1897 at the Queen's Hall in London.\n\nEnglish music critic Ernest Newman described this as music to which one would not want to die or awaken. \"It is too spectacular, too brilliantly lit, too full of pageantry of a crowd; whereas this is a journey one must make very quietly, and alone\".\n\nFrench critic Romain Rolland in his \"Musiciens d'aujourd'hui\" (1908) called the piece \"one of the most moving works of Strauss, and that which is constructed with the noblest utility\".\n\nThere are four parts (with Ritter's poetic thoughts condensed):\nA typical performance lasts about 25 minutes.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c { \\clef bass \\key ees \\major \\time 4/4 r4^\"Transfiguration theme\" f,-. bes( c | d d' c2) } </score>\n\n\n\n\nIn one of Strauss's last compositions, \"Im Abendrot\" from the \"Four Last Songs\", Strauss poignantly quotes the \"transfiguration theme\" from his tone poem of 60 years earlier, during and after the soprano's final line, \"Ist dies etwa der Tod?\" (Is this perhaps death?).\n<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff « \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\key ees \\major \\time 4/4 \\partial 2*1 s2 | r4 a( d2~ | d4 e fis fis') | s1 | s1 | s1 | s1 } \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\key ees \\major \\time 4/4 fis2 | fis r | r a | a r | r bes | ces1~ | ces2 } \\addlyrics { ist dies et- wa der Tod? } » } </score>\nJust before his own death, he remarked that his music was absolutely correct; his feelings mirrored those of the artist depicted within; Strauss said to his daughter-in-law as he lay on his deathbed in 1949: \"It's a funny thing, Alice, dying is just the way I composed it in \"Tod und Verklärung\".\"\n\n\n"}

Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of principle (\"rights\") which are themselves based in concepts of social equality or enfranchisement.\n\nSince the term became popular in the 1970s to describe a diagnostic for narcissism, in the 1980s and onward that negative connotation has carried forward into political speech and the word no longer needs to be prefixed with terms like \"unwarranted\" to be seen as disparaging.\n\nWhile an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.\n\nPsychoanalysis differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised. The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or narcissistic injury; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one. A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others, a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in self-esteem. \n\nIvan Boszormenyi-Nagy distinguished in adult life between (ethically) \"earning\" entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different. Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one. The gambler may feel \"entitled\" to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.\n\nAn inflated sense of what is sometimes called \"psychological entitlement\" - unrealistic, exaggerated, or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists. According to the DSM-5, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are likely to have a \"sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others\", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments: Similarly, according to Vaknin, the narcissistic personality attempts to protect the vulnerable self by building layers of grandiosity and a huge sense of entitlement. Similar to individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, those with borderline personality disorder display a strong sense of entitlement, according to research conducted by Dr. John Gunderson and Dr. Elsa Ronningstam. Ronningstam and Gunderson state \"\"Characteristics shared by the two disorders and thus failing to discriminate between NPD and BPD are notable. A sense of entitlement occurred in both diagnostic groups in Morey's and our studies; that is, both narcissists and borderlines felt that others should recognize their needs and give them special favours\"\"\n\n"}

His youth was unremarkable except for a love for the classics. His father was a prosperous Gascon with links to the nobility. He came from Saint-Germain-de-la-Sauvetat and worked as the head of post. His mother, Marthe Roman, came from Arles. Paul de Vivie lived at Tarascon, Meyzieu, and studied at Lachassagne, near Lyon until 1870.\n\nDe Vivie went into the silk industry as an apprentice and then opened his own business in St-Étienne before he was 30. He married in St-Étienne in 1876. He lived at 6 rue Brossard.\n\nHe bought his first bicycle, a penny-farthing when he was 28, in 1881. In that year he became the founding secretary of Les Cyclistes Stéphanois. The club held its first meeting at 1 rue des Arts, St-Étienne, on 23 October 1881. The address was the home of a member, A. Jourjon, and became the club's address when it was registered as a new organisation at the préfecture on 11 March 1882. Evidence that de Vivie was a reasonably prosperous man is shown in a club rule that allowed membership only to amateurs, a definition which excluded ordinary working men. Further evidence is the writer Jean-Pierre Baud's calculation that a bicycle cost 200 francs or 56 times the daily wage of an everyday worker.\n\nClub membership cost 17 francs the first year and 12 francs in subsequent year. Membership was open not only to those who pedalled but others who preferred machines \"furnished by steam, electricity and any other propulsion.\"\n\nA friend challenged de Vivie to ride his new bicycle 100 km in six hours and he set out to the mountain resort of Chaise-Dieu. The peace, adventure and countryside changed his life - and persuaded him he needed a better bike. A year later he bought a Bayliss tricycle, followed by a tandem tricycle and others. His work in the silk industry required trips to England and it was there, in Coventry, then the centre of the world cycle industry, that he was inspired by British bicycles and joined the Cyclists' Touring Club. In 1887, he sold his business, opened the Agence Générale Vélocipédique in St-Étienne to import bikes from Coventry, and began a magazine, \"Le Cycliste Forézien\", renamed \"Le Cycliste\" the following year.\n\nDe Vivie imported machines from England. In 1889 he made a bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had a diamond frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 when one of his readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two chain wheels on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split chain wheel. Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the chain wheel open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his Cheminot in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling.\n\nIt has been said that de Vivie invented something which already existed, in Britain, and simply made the derailleur better known.\nTraditional cyclists did not appreciate his gears. The organiser of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, dismissed them in \"L'Auto\" as fit only for invalids and women. De Vivie campaigned for his invention and rode every morning up the col de la République for the joy of passing riders without them.\n\nThe Touring Club de France organised a challenge in 1902 in which a female rider, Marthe Hesse, participated riding a Gauloise with a three-speed derailleur. Hesse was one among only four riders crossing the Tourmalet without setting foot to the ground. Desgrange, though, wrote:\n\nDe Vivie's invention is in the museum of art and industry at St-Étienne. His friend, Albert Raimond, developed the idea and started the Cyclo gear company. Raimond, like Vivie, was fond of hilly rides.\n\nDe Vivie was also an early advocate of tires of up to 57mm (2.25 in) cross-section on rims as small as 500mm (20 in), preceding modern advocates of small wheel bicycles such as Alex Moulton. In 1911 he wrote:\n\nVelocio died at St-Étienne, France. His obituary in the Gazette of the Cyclists' Touring Club pictured him with an open-framed small-wheel bicycle.\n\nVélocio wrote of his tours in a language that inspired a nation - France - in which holidays with pay were unknown:\n\nOr again:\n\nDe Vivie was a vegetarian, a speaker of Esperanto and a strict man who started every day of his later life by reading ancient Greek. On February 27, 1930, the last words he read were from Seneca to Lucius:\n\nThen he collected his bike and began pushing it across the road. He stepped back to avoid a car and was hit and killed by a tram. His memorial is at the top of the col de la République. Its inscription reads: \"Paul de Vivie, alias Vélocio (Pernes 1853 - St-Étienne 1930). Apostle of cycle-touring and promoter of gears [\"changements de vitesse\"]. Monument erected by the town of Pernes-les-Fontaines on the 150th anniversary of his birth. Inaugurated 20 April 2003.\"\n\nHe coined the French term \"cyclo-tourisme\", which continues in use. He is buried in the cemetery at Loyasse, near Lyon. His plaque reads: \"To their venerable master, the cyclo-tourists of St-Étienne.\" A road is named after him in St-Étienne.\n\nThe American writer Clifford Graves said in May 1965:\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1983 with support of the Lions Club of Australia and headquartered in the suburb of , Western Australia. The LEI is a not-for-profit centre of excellence that combines an ophthalmic clinic with scientific discovery developing techniques for the prevention of blindness and the reduction of pain from blinding eye conditions.\n\nAt a 1970 convention in Albany, Western Australia, the Western Australian Lions Clubs created the Lions Save Sight Foundation (WA) Inc. with the aim of leading the development of ophthalmic care. In 1975 the Lions Save-Sight Foundation (LSSF) established the Lions Chair in Ophthalmology at the University of Western Australia. Since its establishment, clinical facilities, new equipment, and research laboratories have been strategically commissioned to support the LEI's core activities. In 1983, under Professor Ian Constable's guidance, the LEI, a not-for-profit organisation was established. With Constable, the LEI became an international centre for scientific research into blindness. Following its development, it relocated to the grounds of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Its current Managing Director Bill Morgan leads a team of clinicians, medical professionals, researchers and support staff. In 1994, the Institute created in partnership with the University of Western Australia, the Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science (COVS). This centre has an independent University status within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2003, the LEI revised its basis of incorporation from a public benevolent charitable institution to a not-for profit limited liability company.\n\nThe LEI employs scientists, clinicians, and support staff to conduct scientific research into blindness with known ophthalmic practices in Australia. The Institute also includes a Laser Vision Centre, Western Australia's refractive surgery centre; the Lions Eye Bank, Lions Outback Vision, Lions Optics and the LSSF. The LEI actively participates in numerous clinical trials for the development of new treatments for eye diseases, in collaboration with scientists, ophthalmologists, and pharmaceutical companies. The Institute receives funds from clinic operations and its grants from organisations such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, individual benefactors and the LSSF.\n\nThe LEI provides a range of services including standard clinical services, LASIK surgery at the Lions Laser Vision Center, cataract micro-surgery and lens implantation, plastic surgery of the eyelids and full optometric service at Lions Optics. The Lions Eye Bank collects and distributes corneal tissue, scleral tissue and supplies thousands of corneal transplants throughout Western Australia. The Institute initiated the Pilbara Aboriginal Eye Health Program, a strategy targeting indigenous people who suffer from diabetes and associated blinding eye diseases prevalent within the Aboriginal population. As part of the Australian Government aid to the Indonesian Government, In July 2007, the LEI was instrumental in setting up the Bali Mandara Eye Hospital which was handed over to the Indonesian Government on 13 October 2015. The LEI provides open consultations and health education seminars in cooperation with several organisations including Glaucoma Australia, Retinitis Pigmentosa Society of Western Australia, Macular Degeneration Foundation and the Australian Foundation for the Prevention of Blindness. Its ophthalmologists also consult at Perth's main teaching public hospitals including Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Royal Perth Hospital and Fremantle Hospital.\n\nThe LEI teams investigate all major causes of blindness including cataracts, diabetes related eye disease, glaucoma, retinal degenerations, corneal, and immune-based diseases. More than 70 scientists at the LEI use a range of technologies to develop treatments for blinding diseases, including gene therapy and telemedicine. The LEI has national and international institutional partnerships including American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Shanghai University, Swedish University of Agricultural Science, University of Missouri and the National Eye Institute (USA). For example, the LEI participates in joint research and development projects with the American Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, University of Missouri and the National Eye Institute (USA). Research carried out by the Institute teams led to the first retinal vein bypass treatment of blockages, and the development of the first transgenic mouse model for Age-Related Macular Degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for people over 55. This model is expected to accelerate the development of ARMD leading to an effective treatment. At the LEI, the first artificial cornea, the AlphaCor was developed and implanted into a human eye. The LEI is acknowledged as a core academic centre involved in clinical trials of new pharmaceutical therapies and surgical procedures before government approval. For example, the Xen Gel Stent, an implantable transcleral microsurgical device developed at the LEI was approved for use in the US by the FDA in 2016.\n\n"}

A government webpage lists these as Ashwat, Qamar Din Karez, Sambaza and Zhob, without indicating if any of them are sub-tehsils.\n\nThe 1998 census counted a total population of in the two subdistricts of Kakar Khurasan and Zhob (the third subdistrict has since been established as the separate Sherani District). The majority of the population (%) have Pashto as their first language, but there are also speakers of Saraiki (1.8%) and Punjabi (1.77%).\n\nThe vast majority of the population of Zhob district is Pashtun. The indigenous tribes of Zhob include the Mandokhail, Khosti,\nSulemankhel, Sherani, Kakar, Harifal, Lawon and Babar. Currently a large number of IDPs have been settled within the confines of the District as part of the evacuation from Operation Zarb-E-Azb taking place to the north of Zhob.\n\nwww.zamazhob.asia\nZhob District at www.balochistan.gov.pk\n"}

His early architectural career was in partnership with John Mead Howells. Stokes was a pioneer in social housing who co-authored the 1901 New York tenement house law. For twenty years he worked on \"The Iconography of Manhattan Island\", a six volume compilation that became one of the most important research resources about the early development of the city. His designs included St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University and several urban housing projects in New York City. He was also a member of the New York Municipal Arts Commission for twenty-eight years and president for nine of these.\n\nHe was educated at St. Paul's School, Concord, and Berkeley School in New York City before graduating from Harvard in 1891. He later took post graduate courses at Columbia University and then Italy before studying for three years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He married Edith Minturn — daughter of Sarah Susannah Shaw and Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr. — in 1895 at La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada. They lived in Paris whilst Stokes continued his studies. A friend sponsored their portrait \"Mr. and Mrs. I. N. Phelps Stokes\", by John Singer Sargent, as a wedding gift. Edith also served as the artist's model for a well-known sculpture, Statue of the Republic by Daniel Chester French, and a portrait by Cecilia Beaux. She was President of the New York Kindergarten Association. She was the aunt of Edie Sedgewick, who was named after her.\n\nHe founded an architectural firm, Howells & Stokes, with a partner, John Mead Howells, in 1897. Their first commission was the University Settlement Society building at 184 Eldridge Street, New York. Howells and Stokes were active in New York, but also opened an office on the West Coast in Seattle, designing many of the Metropolitan Tract buildings during the 1910s. The partners parted company on amicably terms in the mid 1910s. Their work had included the Baltimore Stock Exchange; University site development, Seattle; American Geographical Society Building, New York and the Turks Head Building, Providence. Howells continue to design skyscrapers, including the Tribune Tower and Daily News Building, New York, in collaboration with Raymond Hood.\n\nStokes was appointed by his aunts, Caroline and Olivia Stokes, to design several of their charitable building projects. These included: the Tuskegee tenement building in New York (1901); St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University (1907); Berea College Chapel (1906); Woodbridge Hall at Yale (part of the Hewitt Quadrangle) (1901); two tenements called the Dudley complex at 339-349 East 32nd Street, New York (1910); an outdoor pulpit for St. John the Divine Cathedral (1916) and memorial gates at both Harvard and Yale universities, Hartford First Church Cemetery and Redlands Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in California. Howells and Stokes also provided designs for the Protestant College in Beirut, an institute supported by the Stokes and Dodge families. Caroline Stokes funded work at the Booker T. Washington Tuskegee institutes. The architect for these works was Robert Robinson Taylor, who was offered some professional advice by I. N. Phelps Stokes, but this proved to be unhelpful to Taylor who was working with limited resources.\n\nStokes was involved with family owned property management companies, building and running apartment and office blocks in New York. In addition to his commercial work, he designed private housing such as Sanger Hill, a New York State country house for his cousin Colonel William Sanger; Beacon Hill House, Newport, Rhode Island for his uncle Arthur Curtiss James; Brick House, Collender's Point, Darien, Connecticut for his parents; and a house for his wife at Indian Harbor, Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1910, Stokes dismantled a large timber framed house, formerly the Queens Head, located next to what is now the A140 Ipswich to Norwich route in Thwaite, Suffolk, UK. He transported it in 688 crates from Tilbury Docks to the USA, where it was re-constructed using the timbers of a wrecked English ship, on a hill overlooking Long Island Sound near Greenwich, Connecticut. It was renamed High Low House (one of its former names whilst standing in Thwaite).\n\nStokes was active in housing reform. He was appointed a member of the Tenement House Committee of the Charity Organisation Society in 1899, and was appointed a member of the State Tenement House Committee by Governor Roosevelt in 1901. He was a member of the Executive Committee and chairman of the Committee on New Building and in this role was a co-author of the Tenement House Law of 1901.\n\nHe became a political ally and then a friend of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. During the New Deal, as head of the Art Commission, Stokes oversaw the WPA mural program for the City of New York, which sponsored murals at locations including the Marine Air Terminal at LaGuardia Airport, Harlem Hospital, and New York Public Library.\n\nAt various times Stokes was director and president of the Phelps-Stokes Fund; trustee, New York Public Library; honorary vice-president, Community Service Society of New York, Fine Arts Federation of New York and President of the Municipal Art Commission of New York. Following the death of his wife he resigned many of his public duties. At his retirement from the Municipal Arts Commission in 1939, Mayor La Guardia said: “\"All through the city physical changes are being made, and a great deal of it is due to your vision and your perfect artistic style. Once in a while a modernistic piece has crept in on us, but it has been more than offset by your selections. All I can do is express my regret that you are leaving us.\"\"\n\nStokes may be best remembered for an exhaustive and authoritative six volume work entitled \"The Iconography of Manhattan Island\", published between 1915 and 1928.\n\nStokes prefaced the first volume with the following objective:\n\nHis initial thoughts were that the work would be covered in one volume, but he had underestimated and eventually six were required. In the last volume he wrote:\nWhilst compiling the work, Stokes had become an obsessive collector and spent large sums with dealers in America and Europe. He bequeathed the prints from his collection to the New York Public Library, but financial hardship during the depression years forced him to sell many other works.\n\nA fire started in the New York State Capitol at Albany in the early hours of 29 March 1911. The building housed the New York State Library, and it was feared that many historical documents were lost or damaged in the fire. The trustees of the New York Public Library asked I. N. Phelps Stokes to go to Albany and offer support. When he arrived he became involved with the salvage. He first surveyed the building to ensure it was safe for workers to enter. A preliminary inspection by Stokes and the archivist, Mr van Laer found that some documents still survived under the damage but urgent action was required to save them. Governor Dix arranged for soldiers to help and they formed a chain to carry salvaged papers and books to a place of safety. The fire continued to break out as they worked and to add to their problems the weather was so cold that water froze. It was estimated that 80% of the archive was lost in the fire. The night-watchman’s body was also discovered in the rubble.\n\nStokes was descended from New York merchants and bankers. His maternal grandfather, Isaac Newton Phelps, was born of farming stock and built his fortune from hardware and later banking. When he died in 1888 he left Stokes $100,000 dollars plus a part share in a legacy. His paternal grandfather, James Boulter Stokes, married Caroline, the daughter of Anson Greene Phelps and in doing so became the brother-in-law of William E. Dodge, Daniel James and Benjamin Bakewell Atterbury. All possessed of strong individualism but sharing a strong sense of social duty, driven by their religious beliefs. Many of their children and grandchildren were philanthropist, activists and missionaries.\n\nStokes had eight siblings, they were: \n• Sarah Maria Phelps Stokes (1869-1943) who married Baron Halkett in 1890 and divorced in 1902. She wrote children's books under the name of Aunt Sadie.\n• Helen Olivia Phelps Stokes ( 1870-1945) who was an activist and painter.\n• James Graham Phelps Stokes (1872-1960) a noted socialist.\n• Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes (1874-1958) an educator and clergyman.\n• Ethel Valentine Phelps Stokes (1876-1952) who married philanthropist John Sherman Hoyt in 1895.\n• Caroline M. Phelps Stokes (1878-1964) who married Robert Hunter, sociologist and author.\n• Mildred Phelps Stokes (1881-1970) who married Dr Ransom Spafard Hooker.\n• Harold Montrose Phelps Stokes (1887-1970) who was on the New York Times and a free-lance author.\n\nStokes and Edith Minturn did not have children of their own, but adopted a daughter in 1906.\n\nEdith died in 1937 after a debilitating illness.\n\n"}

{"id": "2083642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083642", "title": "Laughing Clowns", "text": "Laughing Clowns\n\nLaughing Clowns, sometimes written as The Laughing Clowns, is a post-punk band formed in Sydney in 1979. In five years, the band released three LPs, three EPs, and various singles and compilations. Laughing Clowns' sound is free jazz, bluegrass and krautrock influenced. The band formed to accommodate Ed Kuepper's growing interest in expanding brass-driven elements he had brought to The Saints' third album, \"Prehistoric Sounds\", and by adopting flattened fifth notes in a rock and roll setting while using a modern jazz styled band line-up.\n\nAlong with The Birthday Party, The Go-Betweens, The Moodists and The Triffids, the Laughing Clowns also spent extended periods in Europe during the early 1980s, and gained an international cult status. All four aforementioned groups have cited Laughing Clowns as an influence at some point in their respective careers.\n\nLaughing Clowns were formed in April 1979 in Sydney as a rock, soul, avant-jazz group by Bob Farrell on saxophone, Ed Kuepper on lead guitar and lead vocals (ex-Kid Galahad and the Eternals, The Saints), Ben Wallace-Crabbe on bass guitar, and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (ex-The Saints, Last Words, Young Charlatans). In late 1978 Kuepper had quit punk rock band, The Saints, in London – where they had relocated from Brisbane – due to a rift with fellow founder, Chris Bailey regarding future direction . Kuepper preferred \"less commercial, more cerebral material\" as seen on the band's third album, \"Prehistoric Sounds\" (October 1978).\n\nWhen Kuepper returned to Australia in 1978 he had contemplated retirement, however he reconnected with two old school friends, Farrell and Wegener, at a party and they coaxed him into forming a new band. Both Farrell and Wegener had associations with The Saints: Wegener was an early member in 1975 and Farrell was one of the Flat Top Four, which performed backing vocals on \"Kissin' Cousins\" for that band's debut album, \"(I'm) Stranded\" (February 1977). Ben Wallace-Crabbe had played in a Melbourne band, The Love, with Wegener, and completed the initial line-up. A proposed single by The Saints, \"Laughing Clowns\" / \"On the Waterfront\", through EG Records was not recorded by that group due to the difference of opinion between Kuepper and Bailey. Each track appeared elsewhere: \"On the Waterfront\" on The Saints' first post-Kuepper EP, \"Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow\" (March 1980) and \"Laughing Clowns\" provided Kuepper's new band's name and their self-titled six-track mini-album in May that year.\n\nLaughing Clowns made their public debut in August 1979, immediately encountering both confusion and antipathy from The Saints' fans who expected a more abrasive punk sound. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted that \"Part of the problem was that the band's sound defied categorisation. Having to overcome such ludicrous labels as 'jazz-punk' ... [it] was diverse yet moody, at turns melodic or dissonant. It ranged from rock and soul to avant-jazz\". The Saints' \"Prehistoric Sounds\" had not received a local release via EMI until 1979, so Laughing Clowns performed various tracks from that album in their early sets – including \"The Prisoner\" and \"Swing for the Crime\". Later in the year, Ben's cousin and former guitarist in the Melbourne-based version of Crime & the City Solution as well as The Love, Dan Wallace-Crabbe, joined the group on piano.\n\nThis five-piece incarnation recorded \"Laughing Clowns\" at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne with production by Kuepper, and engineering by Tony Cohen. All six tracks were written by Kuepper. Released via Missing Link, it gained favourable reviews in the Australian independent music press. McFarlane opined that the EP was \"unlike any other [record] made in Australia to that point. The music's only parallel lay in latter-day Saints as a logical progression from \"Prehistoric Sounds\", but at the same time it was a departure, a foray into new territory. The open-ended song arrangements were stirring and provocative, but also disconcerting. The production values were cavernous and echoey; a fascinating sound, but very cold and detached\".\n\nA promotional video for one of its tracks, \"Holy Joe\", was filmed. Upon the EP's release, they expanded to a six-piece group with Peter Doyle on trumpet. This configuration performed at the Paris Theatre in Sydney in November 1980, with The Birthday Party and The Go-Betweens; this was to be the last gig with Farrell. Ben also left the group before the year's end and his cousin, Dan followed within a few months. Ben subsequently formed Upside Down House, and later committed suicide.\n\nThe group's second release, a three-track EP, \"Sometimes, the Fire Dance...\", appeared on the Prince Melon imprint in February 1981 – a label run by then-manager, Ken West, and Kuepper. The label name 'Prince Melon' was the nickname the band had for West. This EP had been recorded in mid-June 1980 with the six-piece line-up, again with Cohen engineering, but the whole group produced it. Jonathan Green of \"The Canberra Times\" felt the EP had \"[s]uper songs, especially the A side, which strikes the odd emotional chord (sob), from one of the most challenging bands in the country. Apparently poppy, with an underlying and sinister atonality\".\n\nIn March 1981 the band released a third EP, \"Laughing Clowns 3\", with five tracks. In July the two Prince Melon EPs were combined to create their first compilation album, \"Throne of Blood/Reign of Terror\". The line-up of Doyle, Kuepper and Wegener continued as a three-piece exploring much freer arrangements, and drawing from the band's mutual interest in free jazz. By mid-1981 they gained Louise Elliott on saxophone and flute and Leslie 'Bif' Millar on fretless and upright bass guitar. With this new line-up, the band delved further into jazz-inspired improvisation and experimentation.\n\nIn March 1982 Laughing Clowns issued its debut album, \"Mr Uddich-Schmuddich Goes to Town\". It had been recorded in November of the previous year and was produced by Doyle, Kuepper and Wegener; engineered by Doyle and Peter Walker (ex-Bakery guitarist). It showed a change of approach with the addition of Millar's jazz-schooled bass playing. Much like the work of Captain Beefheart, the seemingly improvisational elements are predetermined by Kuepper, the band's primary songwriter, except the LP's title track.\n\nJim Green, of TrouserPress, summarised the group's history and described this album as displaying \"a shift in the lineup brought in a new saxman and bassist (playing acoustic stand-up) and dropped the pianist. The tracks are more succinct, and the overall impression is that of consolidation and retrenchment\". Alex Griffin of Life is Noise website lists it as one of his Top Australian Albums, \"Despite sounding like it was recorded inside Ed’s cavernous, musty trachea, the songs are paranoid and shifting, propelled as ever by Jeffrey Wagoner’s drumming which sounds like a jittery dinosaur in a Chinese tea room\". Soon after its release the band, except Doyle, relocated briefly to Europe and recorded a session for John Peel which appeared on a four-track EP, \"Everything That Flies Is not a Bird\", released in 1983. By the end of 1982, the group had temporarily split due to internal tensions, and Wegener joined The Birthday Party for a tour of the Netherlands early the following year.\n\nKuepper reformed Laughing Clowns in May 1983 with Elliott and Wegener but without Millar. They added Peter Milton Walsh (ex-The Apartments) on bass guitar. Walsh had not played bass guitar in a band before; he appeared on the group's second album, \"Law of Nature\". It was recorded during the latter half of 1983 in Sydney and released in April 1984 on the newly formed label, Hot, and included contributions from pianist Chris Abrahams. A single, \"Eternally Yours\", was released on 12\" in March and a promotional video was made to promote it. The group started a national tour, \"The Canberra Times\" correspondent noted gig giveaways included \"Free flexi-discs of the band's new single, 'Eternally Yours', which will include one unreleased track, ... to the first 300 people passing through the door. Albums and 12inch giveaways are on the agenda\". The line-up were \"well-established\" with Kuepper, Wegener, Elliot, and Walsh.\n\nThe album employs the recording of dual acoustic and electric guitar tracks, and a more song-based approach. \"The Canberra Times\" reviewer, Debbie Muir, noted its \"innovative, though frankly bitter, style that's not punk or new wave or straight rock but just its unpretentious self\". She praised the lead single as \"The best track by far... [it] conveys an atmosphere of drooling sadness ... the extended single version is much, much better\" than the album's version. McFarlane praised the album and its lead single as being \"amongst the band's very finest works. There were moments of great beauty on \"Law of Nature\" such as 'Law of Nature', 'Written in Exile' and 'Eternally Yours', where Elliot's soulful and epic sax riff danced majestically in the air\". After a national and European tour in support of the album, Walsh departed to reform The Apartments and Paul Smith replaced him as bassist.\n\nLaughing Clowns were expanded with the addition of Glad Reed on trumpet, Dianne Spence on saxophone, and Louis Tillett on piano. In October 1984 they began recording \"Ghosts of an Ideal Wife\", at Alberts Studios. By Christmas of that year, the band split after international and national tours, with Kuepper finishing the album, early in 1985. A posthumous single, the double A side \"Just Because I Like\" / \"Crystal Clear\" was released in February 1985 via Hot Records. Shortly after disbanding Elliott and Wegener briefly joined The Saints for an Australian tour. Kuepper began work on his debut solo LP, \"Electrical Storm\" (June 1985).\n\nMuch of the Laughing Clowns' saga was recounted in the book, \"\" (1996), by Australian rock music writer, Clinton Walker. Walker had been a confidante of the band and one of its outspoken critical champions. In September 2005 Tim Ritchie of Radio National reviewed their 3× CD compilation album, \"Cruel but Fair (The Complete Clowns Recordings)\", and described their style as \"so singular, so 'not part of the trends' that they would either have people walking out of gigs in droves, or have them swear they were witness to something akin to greatness\". The anthology was released on 3 October 2005 to further critical acclaim, Donat Tahiraj of \"Time Off\" magazine declared they were \"the most inventive and innovative Australian band of the post-punk era\".\n\nIn 2004 Kuepper and Wegener performed together on \"Ed Kuepper's MFLL\" project, a live presentation of soundtracks to short films which toured Australia and Europe, including a show at the Cartier Foundation. Subsequently, Wegener joined Kuepper's touring band, The Kowalski Collective, and appeared on his concept album, \"Jean Lee and the Yellow Dog\" (September 2007). A version of The Laughing Clowns was re-formed, only for purposes of playing live. In 2008 Kuepper restarted the Prince Melon record label, and in March of the following year released a live album, \"Prince Melon Bootleg Series Volume 7: Laughing Clowns Live\". The concert was at The Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane with a line-up of Elliott, Kuepper, Millar, Wegener and Alister Spence on keyboards.\n\nThis line-up also played the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2009, curated by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and an eastern states tour. The band toured Australia in January 2010, again, as a part of All Tomorrow's Parties' \"Don't Look Back\" series of shows supporting Dirty Three. For the tour Laughing Clowns performed their 1984 compilation, \"History of Rock 'n' Roll Volume One\", in its entirety. Prince Melon issued two further live albums in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

True dwarfism is often associated with a cluster of physical abnormalities, including pituitary dwarfism. The process of dwarfing is used to selectively breed for smaller stature with each generation. Small stature is a characteristic of neoteny, which may account (in part) for the attraction of dwarf animals.\n\nThe Netherland Dwarf is the smallest of the domestic rabbits.

{"id": "2083669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083669", "title": "Celtic music in the United States", "text": "Celtic music in the United States\n\nIrish, Scottish and Welsh music have long been a major part of American music, at least as far back as the 18th century. Beginning in the 1960s, performers like the Clancy Brothers became stars in the Irish music scene, which dates back to at least the colonial era, when many Irish immigrants arrived. These included many Scots-Irish Presbyterians, whose music was most \"closely related to a Lowland Scottish style\" .\n\nThe most significant impact of Celtic music on American styles, however, is undoubtedly that on the evolution of country music, a style which blends Anglo-Celtic traditions with \"sacred hymns and African American spirituals\". Country music's roots come from \"Americanized interpretations of English, Scottish and Scots-Irish traditional music, shaped by African American rhythms, and containing vestiges of (19th century) popular song, especially (minstrel songs)\" . \n\nCeltic-Americans have also been influential in the creation of Celtic fusion, a set of genres which combine traditional Celtic music with contemporary influences.\n\nIrish traditional music in the United States has a long and varied history, both in recording culture and by live performances. Emigrants from Ireland have brought their instruments and repertoire to the United States since the earliest days of European colonization of the New World.\n\nThe history of Irish musicians from Ireland taking up residency in New York and beyond is one side of the story. Another is the learning and playing of Irish music by first and second generation Irish-Americans. And then yet another is the widespread interest in the music by Americans from every background.\n\nMasters of the tradition have come to live in the United States. Chief O'Neill in Chicago was a major promoter of musicianship and tune collection, greatly impacting the tradition beyond his own day and place of re-settlement. In the late nineteenth century and long after that, Patsy Touhey from Loughrea was a popular touring artist.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the classic recordings of Irish traditional music were made in New York by Michael Coleman, Packie Dolan, Hughie Gillespie, Jim Morrison and many others. This recording culture continues to the present day.\n\nIn the wake of the Depression and World War, Irish traditional music in New York was belittled by showband culture, and performers like Jack Coen, Paddy O'Brien of Tipperary, Larry Redican, and Paddy Reynolds kept the tradition alive in the United States, and were teachers of the music to Irish Americans.\n\nMany great Irish American performers like Andy McGann, Brian Conway, Joannie Madden, Jerry O'Sullivan, Liz Carroll and Billy McComiskey would rise to achieve a level of accomplishment in the traditional music usually associated with native Irish.\n\nLater Irish emigration to New York and beyond by James Keane, Mick Moloney, Paddy Keenan, Paddy O'Brien of Offaly, Martin Hayes and others through the 1960s, 1970s and 80s, ensured the music performed in America stayed connected to Ireland.\n\nRecent emigration by Ivan Goff and Cillian Vallely to New York has kept the stream of native players strong, and the American scene rich with native talent.\n\nWhile Irish American players like Patrick Mangan continue to prove Irish American culture is strongly connected to the roots.\n\nMany Welsh songs have been adopted into American music culture, such as \"Ar Hyd y Nos\" (\"All Through the Night\", performed by Sheryl Crow, among others); \"Suo Gân\" (featured in the film \"Empire of the Sun\"), and \"Lisa Lân\" (featured in the film \"Crash\").\n\nIrish immigrants created a large number of \"emigrant ballads\" once in the United States. These were usually \"sad laments, steeped in nostalgia, and self-pity, and singing the praises... of their native soil while bitterly condemning the land of the stranger\" . These songs include famous songs like \"Thousands Are Sailing to America\" and \"By the Hush\", though \"Shamrock Shore\" may be the most well known in the field.\n\nFrancis O'Neill was a Chicago police chief who collected the single largest collection of Irish traditional music ever published. He was a flautist, fiddler and piper who was part of a vibrant Irish community in Chicago at the time, one that included some forty thousand people, including musicians from \"all thirty-two counties of Ireland\", according to Nicholas Carolan, who referred to O'Neill as \"the greatest individual influence on the evolution of Irish traditional dance music in the twentieth century\" .\n\nIn the 1890s, Irish music entered a \"golden age\", centered on the vibrant scene in New York City. This produced legendary fiddlers like James Morrison and Michael Coleman, and a number of popular dance bands that played pop standards and dances like the foxtrot and quicksteps; these bands slowly grew larger, adding brass and reed instruments in a big band style . Though this golden age ended by the Great Depression, the 1950s saw a flowering of Irish music, aided by the foundation of the City Center Ballroom in New York City. It was later joined by a roots revival in Ireland and the foundation of Mick Moloney's Green Fields of America, a Philadelphia-based organization that promotes Irish music .\n\nDuring the late 20th century came the rise of Celtic inspired rock groups like Flogging Molly, who reside in Los Angeles, Black 47 from New York City, The Shillaly Brothers, also from Los Angeles and the Dropkick Murphys from Boston.\n\nDynamic identities contribute to Benedict Anderson’s notions of nationalism and nationality. The Celtic identities constructed in America contribute to the dynamic being of American nationalism that we are founded upon. Freedom, a foundational principle of American society, was encouraged by the Celtic influence in Appalachia through their contribution to Union forces during the Civil War. The Union was a more democratizing entity and more willing to accept pluralism in American society compared to their Confederate counterparts who were more bent on maintaining a separatist identity\n\nAccording to Benedict Anderson, “nationality” was formed from the accumulation of cultural artifacts that were able to be transplanted to an array of environments and societies and merge with a wide variety of political and ideological frameworks. This imagined nationality as Benedict calls it, is a constantly shifting and dynamic entity. “It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members, yet in the mind of each lives the image of their communion.” (Anderson, 6). Celtic identity is one such imagined community. The diaspora of Celts from other areas of the world to America is representative of the imagined community. \nThe cultural diaspora from the British Isles, specifically Scotland and Ireland, landed primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. Thousands of immigrants sailed and maintained and improved on agricultural pursuits to better improve their lives. The British brought with them cultural elements such as music, dress, and ideology. Among these Brits were those defined as Celts, or people who resided in or spoke the languages of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, or Brittany. The Celtic identity is complex: A large portion of this Celticness rested on musical practices, both spoken word and instrumental, that constructs the distinct identity. Layered regional and national identities were assembled over time in the Celtic-speaking world, centered on practices of both modern and historic Celtic instruments.\n\nAmerican Bluegrass and Folk music styles have roots in Appalachian cultures linked to Scottish, Irish, or Celts. Layers of American identity were constructed by the influence of a new musical style. Culture was formed and community was created. Regional identity flourished. This concept of nation building in America is particularly true for the Scots and stems in part from the vast territory that led to development of family autonomy, or Clans, in Scotland and influenced the role of the individual. New layers of identity were created by the influx of Celts to America.\n\nIdentity is composed of characteristics and values that contribute to individuals and communities. Identities combine to form a distinct sense of nationalism.\n\nMichael Dietler asserts that Celtic identity, which rose within Celtic speaking regions such as Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Brittany, is itself an “imagined community” possessing its own nationalist ideals constructed from regional and individual cultural identities. The sense of nationalism that Celts possess is what Dietler refers to as Celticism, “self-conscious attempts to construct ethnicized forms of collective memory and communal identity that are territorially bounded and imbedded in overt political projects and ideologies.” (Dietler 239). He continues to define Celtitude as the feeling felt by those who draw ethnic ties to Celtic life. They feel a sense of ethno-nostalgia for Scottish or Irish heritage. Celticity is centered on a global spiritual connection to the idea of Celtic identity. This is composed of people who wish to identify as something other than white.\n\nDietler’s theories on identity suggest that music and cultural identities have overlapped. Celtic styles merge with other styles and move toward a role as “World Music”: many can relate to world music and Celtic styles create solidarity among those who wish to identify as Celtic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The valve was co-invented by American engineer Donald Shiley and Swedish heart surgeon Viking Björk.\n\nBeginning in 1971, it has been used to replace aortic valves and mitral valves. It was the first successful tilting-disc valve. It was manufactured first by Shiley Laboratories, then later by Pfizer after that company purchased Shiley. One model of the Bjork–Shiley valve became the subject of a famous lawsuit and recall after it was shown to malfunction.\n\nThe Björk–Shiley valve consists of a single carbon-coated disc in a metal housing. The disc is held in place by two metal struts, an inflow and an outflow strut. The housing is made from the alloy Haynes 25, which is composed of 51% cobalt, 20% chromium, 15% tungsten, and 10% nickel. The Björk–Shiley valve was considered very durable and was widely used in the 1970s. However, later research indicated it was susceptible to long-term wear problems, and could shed microscopic metal fragments.\n\nAttempts to improve the design of the valve and speed manufacturing, however, led to a weaker structure, with serious consequences. Beginning in 1979, Björk–Shiley valves with the convexo-concave design had a tendency to develop fractures in the outflow strut which could result in catastrophic valve failure and possibly sudden cardiac death. Later analysis revealed that the strut was fracturing at the place where it was welded onto the metal valve ring. One end of the strut would fracture first, followed by the second strut some months later. Eventually, 619 of the 80,000 convexo-concave valves implanted fractured in this way, with the patient dying in two-thirds of those cases. The FDA withdrew approval of the convexo-concave valve in 1986. Valves welded by specific welders were at greater risk of fracture.\n\nThe convexo-concave valve was withdrawn from the market and multiple lawsuits were filed.\n\nIn 1992, Pfizer (Shiley's parent company) and patients with defective valves agreed to a settlement, with Pfizer proposing a fund of $80 million to $130 million in compensation, and to aside $75 million for research to identify recipients of heart valves with a significant risk of fracture. The eventual settlement totaled $215 million. A separate part of the agreement required Pfizer to provide up to $300 million for patient or survivor claims in the event of valve fractures.\n\nNot all of these valves have been removed and replaced. The risk of valve fracture has been balanced against the risk of the surgery to replace the valve. Decision tools have been published and are available from a trust set up for this purpose during the litigation surrounding the valve \"recall\". The tools take into account patient age, the size and location of the valve (aortic or mitral) and other factors to come up with a recommendation as to whether surgery to replace the valve is worthwhile. In some patients the risk of surgery to replace the valve is higher than the risk of the valve fracturing. A fund was also established for patient compensation and to pay for the costs of heart surgery to replace the valve.\n\nMore recent models of the Björk–Shiley valve did away with the convexo-concave design and are reliable valves that do not require replacement.\n"}

{"id": "2083697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083697", "title": "Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3)", "text": "Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3)\n\nThe appeal was not actually an appeal on the full decision, but an appeal to determine a preliminary issue: specifically whether the proper law to determine the issue was English law or New York law. Macmillan argued that the main issue was a claim in restitution, and so the proper law to determine the issue was English law. The respondent banks argued that the main issue was who had title to the shares, and so the proper law to determine that issue was New York law.\n\nThe trial at first instance on the full facts ([1995] 1 WLR 978, before Millet J) had taken \"the best part of a year, from October 1992 to July 1993\". The respondent banks won at first instance and upon appeal. \n\nMacmillan Inc was a company incorporated in Delaware, and which was controlled by Robert Maxwell It owned a majority shareholding in Berlitz International Inc, a New York company. Under the direction of Maxwell the shares in Berlitz were transferred to Bishopsgate Investments Trust plc (a company owned and controlled by Robert Maxwell and his family) as its nominee. Then, without MacMillan's consent or knowledge, the shares were mortgaged by Bishopsgate to secure loans from three different financial institutions to fund Maxwell's private interests. Accordingly, although it was named as the first defendant in the action, Bishopsgate played little part - the main dispute was fought between Macmillan and the banks who had loaned money to Robert Maxwell on the strength of the Berlitz shares as collateral.\n\nThe central issue in the case was who had better title to the shares: MacMillan as beneficiary under a trust, or the financial institutions as mortgagees. The key to determining these issues was deciding which was the proper law to determine title to the shares. The only previous case relating to this issue (\"Colonial Bank Ltd v Cady and Williams\" (1890) 15 App Cas 267) had been decided over a century before, followed by an \"astonishing period of legal barrenness in judicial and academic consideration\". However, in the present case the issue was complicated by the fact that many of the shares were held indirectly through a securities depository, Depository Trust Company.\n\nAt first instance, after an extremely lengthy trial, Millet J held that the proper law to determine priority of claims was the \"lex loci contractus\" which was New York law. Accordingly, the banks prevailed. Macmillan appealed against the decision, and it was agreed to hear the appeal as to what the proper law to determine the issue was as a preliminary point. The case was conducted largely under the assumption was that if New York law determined title, then the banks would win because they had no actual notice of wrongdoing. But if English law determined title, then Macmillan had an arguable case that the banks had constructive notice of Robert Maxwell's fraud on the grounds they ought to have known he was engaging in fraud when he caused the shares to be mortgaged for the benefit of loans to his private businesses.\n\nAll three judges in the Court of Appeal gave reasoned decisions. One of the most common criticisms of the decision is that although all three judges agreed as to the outcome (that New York law applied), they all gave different reasons - and all of their reasons were different from that of the trial judge.\n\nThe first decision was given by Staughton LJ. He indicated that in relation to a conflict of laws problem, the court essentially has a three-stage problem:\n\nThere are in essence three issues before us, corresponding to the three stages in a conflict case which I have mentioned. They are: (a) how does one characterise the question in this action? (b) What connecting factor does our conflict rule provide for questions of that character? (c) What system of law does that connecting factor require to be applied?\n\nHe then summarised the facts and reviewed the issues each in turn.\n\nIn relation to Stage 1 (characterisation), Macmillan contended the claim relating to restitution (unjust enrichment), and so the issue should be decided in accordance with Rule 201, sub-rule (c) of Dicey & Morris (12th ed.). In the context of this case, that would result in the application of English law, as the law of the place where the enrichment occurs. However he rejected that characterisation - the issue was not whether the banks were enriched - it was whether they had a good defence to the return of the shares. In that case it was not a question of characterising the claim, but characterising the core issue.\n\nIn relation to Stage 2 (choice of law) he held that the relevant law was clearly that of the \"lex situs\" of the property, and cited various authorities in support including \"Winkworth v Christie Manson and Woods Ltd\" [1980] Ch 496 and \"Inglis v Robertson\" [1898] AC 616. But he noted that those cases related to goods, and that the same rule applied in relation to negotiable instruments. However, in relation to intangible property such as choses in action, the usual rule was the priority was determined by the proper law of the chose in action, not its situs (citing Dicey & Morris (12th ed.), Rule 123). He then considered whether shares have \"a rule of their own\". He noted that the evidence of American law (as the law under which the company who issued the shares was incorporated), shares were not negotiable instruments (following \"Williams v Colonial Bank\" sub nom \"Cady\" (1888) 38 Ch D 388 at 403). He reviewed \"Cady\" in some detail and confessed to finding it difficult to draw the boundaries between the issues being discussed. Then with slightly abrupt suddenness he held:\n\nI conclude that an issue as to who has title to the shares in a company should be decided by the law of the place where the shares are situated (lex situs). ... and in this case, that is the law of the place where the company is incorporated. There may be cases where it is arguably the law of the place where the share register is kept, but that problem does not arise today. The reference is to the domestic law of the place in question; at one time there was an argument for renvoi, but mercifully (or sadly, as the case may be) that has been abandoned.\n\nHe then went on to consider Stage 3 (system of law). He held that \"[w]hether it be situs, place of incorporation or place of share register, the answer is the law of and prevailing in the State of New YOrk.\"\n\nThe second (and shortest) judgment was given by Auld LJ. He opened by summarising the issue as \"Who has the better right to ownership of shares in a corporation?\" He also noted that Macmillan framed this issue as a claim for restitution, but the banks asserted it was an issue of priority of claims in relation to an asset. He reviewed the recent cases in what was called \"receipt-based restitutionary claims\" and referred to academic articles which cautioned about how new developments in domestic law should be treated when applying historical choice of law rules. He noted that the usual rule in relation to property claims was to apply the lex situs, and then expresses doubts as to whether choice of law based on restitutionary claims is advisable in this case. He noted that the claim for unjust enrichment was difficult in any event, as the banks gave full value. He eventually concluded that \"even if the facts could support a claim for unjust enrichment, it is the issue that determiend the matter. As I have said, it is essentially a proprietary one\". He rejected the view of the trial judge that the lex loci actus was applicable to the issue.\n\nTurning to the issue of what the lex situs of shares was, he review the authorities which he felt were unsatisfactory. He stated that:\n\nIn my view, there is authority and much to be said for treating issues of priority of ownership of shares in a corporation according to the lex situs of those shares. That will normally be the country where the register is kept, usually but not always the country of incorporation. If the shares are negotiable the lex situs will be where the pieces of paper constituting the negotiable instruments are at the time of transfer.\n\nHe then also reviewed \"Cady\" and distinguished it. He affirmed that the proper law to determine the issue was New York law. Although he did not explicitly reject \"renvoi\" he stated that the proper law was \"the \"domestic\" law of New York.\n\nThe third and final judgment was given by Aldous LJ. After setting out the facts again in some detail, he also affirmed that Macmillan had argued its case on the basis that English law was the proper law to determine the issue as the issue before the court was one of restitution. Conversely the banks argued that this was an issue as to who had the better priority to the shares as a matter of property law. As with the other judges in the Court of Appeal, Aldous LJ felt that this was an issue of property law. He held: \"The issue being one of priority, the law having the closest and most real connection must be New York law. That is the law which governs the right in dispute, namely the right to be placed on the register.\" He went on to expound:\n\nI have no doubt that the transferability of shares in a corporation, the formalities necessary to transfer them and the right of the transferee to be registered on the books of the corporation as the owner of the shares are all governed by the law of incorporation.\n\nHe then proceeded with his own review of \"Cady\" (which he asserted supported his position). He also cited a long string of North American decisions relating to the issue. He then concluded: \"I believe the appropriate law to decide questions of title to property, such as shares, is the lex situs, which is the same as the law of incorporation.\"\n\nAlthough the case is often held up as being determinative of the lex situs of a share in a company, and/or as determining that the doctrine of \"renvoi\" does not apply to intangible property, neither of those points were actually in issue in the case. Macmillan argued for an entirely separate choice of law issue relating to a different characerisation. And the comments of the Court of Appeal in relation to the situs of shares all agreed that they were located in New York, but expressed somewhat different views as to why that was so. The decision that renvoi was not applicable was similarly not argued, as both sides were content that any reference to a foreign law should solely be to the domestic law. Similarly, neither party argued for a different choice of law rule on the basis that the shares were held through intermediaries rather than directly held.\n\nIn relation to whether different issues applied to shares that were negotiable, again the court did not speak with one voice. Both Staughton and Auld LJJ expressed the view that negotiable shares were subject to a different choice of law rule - the law of the place where the relevant certificates were located. But they differed in their judgments as to which law should determine whether shares were negotiable or not: Staughton LJ indicating it was the lex fori and Auld suggesting it was the law of the place where act of negotiation occurs. Ooi rejects both as incorrect. She favours the view of Aldous LJ who implies that the situs of a share, even when negotiable, is the place of the company's incorporation.\n\nThe case broadly received a mixed reception from commentators. It is accepted as authoritative in relation to its approach to characterisation. However its rejection of renvoi is not seen as completely definitive. \n\nIn relation to the main subject for which the case is normally cited, the situs of shares in a company, Dicey Morris & Collins accept it as good authority, but note that it has to be read against a large group of cases which seek to impose a different situs in different situations for different purposes. Hill treats it as largely authoritative with respect to the choice of the lex situs, but refrains from commenting upon the identification of the situs for shares. In that regard it is hard to treat it as a definitive statement of the law. Maisie Ooi in her definitive work on the subject expresses discomfort in relation to the parts of the judgment which refer to the situs of shares being determined by the place of the register.\n\nThe Supreme Court endorsed the decision in . Notably Lord Sumption summarised its effects as \"transmission of property is governed by the lex situs, which in the case of registered shares is the law of the company's incorporation... This proposition is well established and was not seriously disputed: see \"Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3)\" [1996] 1 WLR 387.\" (at para [80]). Lord Mance also referred to the decision with approval, but did not comment specifically on the lex situs of shares.\n\nIn Tomlinson J suggested that the conflicting decisions in \"Macmillan\" are misconstrued. In his judgment he noted that:\n\nThe reasoning in \"Macmillan\" cannot of course be understood without paying careful attention to the characterisation of the issue to which it was directed. Thus if transfer of shares may be effected only by registration on a particular register, the shares must inevitably be regarded as situate at the place where the register is kept for the purpose of ascertaining the efficacy of any purported transfer. However for the purpose of ascertaining the priority of competing proprietary or security interests falling short of registered ownership, only Auld LJ in the Court of Appeal seemed to regard the law of the place where the register is kept as significant – see [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 411E. In that case however the place of incorporation, the place where the share certificates were at the time of the relevant transactions and the place where the share register was kept were all the same, New York, so the point did not need to be decided.\nIn other words, the issue of situs depends upon the purpose. For a transfer it is (or may well be) the place of the register. But for the purposes of priority of title, it is the place of incorporation. This also accords with some older judicial decisions such as \"Brassard v Smith\" [1925] AC 371 which indicated: \"there are ... so many qualities of a share which are attributable to different places it would seem to follow that there cannot be a proper local habitation for a share at all.\"\n\nThere have been various criticisms of the judgment, although not all of them are universally supported.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.\n\nRibnica was attested in written sources in 1220 as \"Rewenitz\" (and as \"Reiwencz\" and \"Reifenitz\" in 1241, \"Reiuenz\" in 1263, \"Reyuinz\" in 1303, and \"Reyfniz\" in 1327). The name was originally a hydronym derived from the common noun \"riba\" 'fish', thus referring to a stream with many fish and, by extension, a settlement along such a stream. In the past, the settlement was known as \"Reifnitz\" in German, and in the local dialect it is known as \"Rîbənca\".\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the area has been settled at least since the late Bronze Age between 1300 and 900 BC. It is first mentioned as \"Rewenicz\" in written documents dating to 1220, making it one of the oldest towns in Slovenia.\n\nRibnica is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Žiglovica Cave Mass Grave () is located northeast of the town, in a former hay field on a slope overgrown with grass and sparse woods. It contains the remains of 14 civilians from Prigorica, Žlebič, and Pri Cerkvi–Struge that were murdered on 28 July 1942. The men were abducted by a Partisan patrol while clearing woods along the railway. Some of the victims were thrown into the shaft alive, and one of them managed to pull a Partisan in with him. After the murders, the local Partisan political activist insisted that the men had merely been sent to White Carniola for punitive labor, but the murders were acknowledged by some of the Partisan participants.\n\nThe parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Stephen and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana.

She later became the youngest model to appear on the cover of the American edition of \"Vogue\", subsequently appearing on the covers of both \"Teen Vogue\" and \"Time\". \"Vogue Paris\" would later declare her as one of the top 30 models of the 2000s. Ward is widely considered to be a supermodel.\n\nWard's first major acting appearance was in the 2008 Australian film \"The Black Balloon\", and she has since also appeared in the films \"The Strangers\" (2008) and \"\" (2011).\n\nGemma Ward was born on 3 November 1987, in Perth, Western Australia, the second of four children of Gary Ward, an Australian doctor, and Claire, an English nurse. She has an older sister, Sophie (who also became a model), and younger twin brothers, Oscar and Henry. She was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies' College and Shenton College. Gemma was the family clown whose ambition was acting. Her passion for acting was born in 1997, when she was cast as the witch in a school play of \"Hansel and Gretel\" at age ten.\n\nWard's brush with modeling was an accidental one. She was discovered in 2002, at the age of fourteen, while accompanying her friends to the Australian modelling competition \"Search for a Supermodel\". As she said in a \"Teen Vogue\" interview, she ended up being scouted herself:\n\nI had come straight from my auntie and uncle's farm, and I was wearing this big gray barn jacket with mud all over it. When the scout came up to me, I said, 'No, thank you.' They forged my mum's signature [for mandatory parental consent], and pushed me in front of the cameras.\n\nWard didn't win the competition, but her fragile, unique look, got the attention of a spotter from Vivien's Model Agency who saw her potential and made a show reel. The show reel then landed on the desk of ace model scout David Cunningham from the New York City agency IMG. \"Look how confident she is. I mean, she looks like she's been doing this for years, and she's a 15-year-old kid walking in an alleyway in Perth [...] She's a supermodel, for sure,\" Cunningham said.\n\nAt 15 Ward made her Australian Fashion Week debut in May 2003. Within a year, she was in Italy meeting Prada designer Miuccia Prada. Her look inspired a new generation of baby doll-like models such as Vlada Roslyakova, Heather Marks, Lily Cole, and Lisa Cant. In September 2004, at only sixteen, Ward became the youngest model to appear on American \"Vogue\" photographed by Steven Meisel as one of the nine \"Models of the Moment\" with Daria Werbowy, Natalia Vodianova, Gisele Bündchen, Isabeli Fontana, Karolina Kurkova, Liya Kebede, Hana Soukupova and Karen Elson. By the end of the year, Ward had appeared on the cover of Australian \"Vogue\" three times, \"British Vogue\", \"Vogue Paris\" and \"Vogue Japan\".\n\nIn February 2005, Ward appeared in no less than 20 New York runways for designers that included Vera Wang, Oscar de la Renta and Klein, and was rumored to earn about $20,000 per show. And at 17, she became the famous face of Calvin Klein's \"Obsession Night\" perfume billboards – bumping Kate Moss out of a job in the process. Ward was reportedly paid $1.3 million for the Calvin Klein campaign and counted similar deals with Burberry and Valentino among her model earnings. Ward additionally appeared in campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana, Balenciaga, Hermès and Dior.\n\nWard then posed for the April 2005 issue of \"Vogue Italia\", the May issue of \"Vogue Greece\" and the Spring 2005 cover of \"TIME\" Magazine's \"Style & Design\" issue. In September 2005, Ward secured a coveted place on the inaugural cover of \"Vogue China\" posing between Chinese models Du Juan and Wang Wenqin and was shot by leading photographer Patrick Demarchelier. A staggering 300,000 copies sold in the first three hours. \"She is every inch blue chip,\" Vivien's agent Suzie Deveridge said. \"Right now she's considered the No. 2 model in the world – and she isn't even 18 yet.\"\n\nBy 2006, Ward became Australia's brightest fashion star since Elle Macpherson. At the age of 18, Ward became the first model ever to appear on the cover of \"Teen Vogue\" magazine. She was then featured in the Australian television program 60 Minutes as the \"It Girl\". She was earning $25,000 to stride the catwalk. In \"Allure\" magazine (October 2006), Ward is described as \"the model of the moment.\" \"Allure\"'s creative director Paul Cavaco stated: \"We went through a period that was very va-va-voom, but now the pendulum has swung back. Gemma is ethereal, not earthy.\" Photographer Michael Thompson says, \"She's an exotic blonde, the rarest of creatures.\"\n\nIn May 2007, Ward again was featured on the cover of \"Vogue Italia\". In July, earning at an estimated total of $3 million in the past 12 months, \"Forbes\" ranked her tenth on the list of the World's 15 Top-Earning Supermodels. In October 2007 Ward appeared on the cover of the very first issue of \"Vogue India\", centered between Bollywood actresses Bipasha Basu and Priyanka Chopra shot by photographer Patrick Demarchelier (who also photographed her in \"Vogue China\") and it became the second time Ward has appeared on an inaugural issue. Ward is only the third model, after Moss and Linda Evangelista to appear on two inaugural issues of \"Vogue\". \"Vogue Paris\" declared her one of the top 30 models of the 2000s.\n\nIn August 2008, reports surfaced that Ward was to retire from modeling to pursue acting. However, reports were quickly dismissed by Ward herself saying: \"I was surprised to wake up this morning and read news of my own retirement. While I am taking some time off currently to rest and enjoy the company of friends and family, I am still very much a (excited and enthusiastic) working model and actress. I'm only 20, for God's sakes.\"\n\nWard wouldn't walk down a runway after the spring 2008 shows for five years. Her final modeling job before her hiatus was an appearance on the cover of and inside the October 2008 issue of Spanish \"Marie Claire\". Slightly over a year later, in November 2009, Ward's agent officially announced her retiring from the industry after her notable absence in the past few runway seasons. Following a series of criticisms about her weight gain, a spokesperson from Viviens modelling agency in New York released a statement, saying: \"Gemma hasn't committed to returning to modeling at any time soon\", adding Ward had the agency's full support. Again, Ward quickly dismissed the retirement claims, confirming that she would return to modeling in 2010.\n\nAfter avoiding the spotlight for three years, Ward opened up in an exclusive interview for \"The Sunday Telegraph\" on 30 January 2011. There she explained that her break from the media spotlight \"was something spurred by Heath's death\". As for her career, she went on to say:In terms of me shying away from modelling, I'd like to clarify in some way that I was taking a break from many things in my life and obviously what people in the public see is that I'm pulling away from what is more 'public'. I didn't know how long it would take, I didn't know if it would solve anything, but I set out to really focus inside myself.\n\nWard shot her first pictorial in years in Australia's \"Sunday Telegraph Magazine\" for the edition of 6 February 2011. In 2013, Ward signed with IMG Models Australia, prompting rumours of a modelling comeback.\n\nOn 18 September 2014, Ward returned to the runway at the Spring/Summer 2015 Prada show during Milan Fashion Week. In December, Ward appeared on the 55th Anniversary cover of Australian \"Vogue\" and along with a 40th-anniversary campaign for Country Road, was announced as the face of Prada's Spring/Summer 2015 campaign. She was also featured on the Spring/Summer 2015 cover of \"Pop\". In April 2015, Ward made her runway return to Australian Fashion Week, opening for Ellery. Ward also became the Australian ambassador for Coca-Cola Life. In September, Ward was on the cover of \"Russh\". In January 2016, she again appeared on the cover of Australian \"Vogue\", also appearing in a Spring/Summer 2016 campaign for Givenchy alongside models including Joan Smalls, Natalia Vodianova and fellow Australian Miranda Kerr. Ward then walked for Calvin Klein menswear at Autumn/Winter Milan Fashion Week. In April, Ward was shot by Mario Testino as part of his guest edited edition of Australian \"Vogue\", their first time working together since 2006. She interviewed Testino about the issue for \"The Daily Telegraph\". The same month, Ward posed for the cover of Australian \"InStyle\" alongside close friends and fellow models Jessica Gomes and Nicole Trunfio. In May, it was announced that Ward would appear as a guest judge on cycle 10 of \"Australia's Next Top Model\".\n\nShe was featured on the July cover of \"Elle\" Australia, a \"lift-and flip\" edition with 35 possible cover combinations of Ward. Ward also featured in a Fall/Winter campaign for David Webb, shot by Inez and Vinoodh.\n\nAt the Spring 2019 shows, Ward walked for Proenza Schouler and Alexander McQueen. She then appeared in editorials for November's \"Allure\" and \"Vogue Italia\" and graced the October cover of \"Vogue\" Thailand, the December cover of Australian \"Harper's Bazaar\", and the March 2019 cover of \"Numéro\" Tokyo. Ward also currently serves as the face of the Hardy Brothers and Zimmermann.\n\nWard has long aspired to pursue acting and drama is a passion that she has held since she was a child. She starred alongside Toni Collette and Rhys Wakefield in Australian director Elissa Down's film \"The Black Balloon\" as the girlfriend of a boy whose brother has autism. \"The Black Balloon\" had its world premiere at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival in Germany in February 2008, where it received a Crystal Bear as the best feature-length film in the \"Generation 14plus\" category. She was also cast opposite Liv Tyler in the suspense thriller \"The Strangers\" as one of the three masked intruders, \"Dollface\". In the summer of 2009, she took classes at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York.\n\nAfter three years out of the spotlight, Ward made her international stage debut on 22 March 2011 for the (PTC) Perth Theatre Company's production of \"The Ugly One\". The play centres on the modern obsession with physical beauty and the need to resort to plastic surgery. Her star power brought the PTC publicity and boosted ticket sales. Perth Now's Maria Noakes gave Ward positive reviews for her performance.\n\nMTV Networks' NextMovie.com named her one of the 'Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011'. In the summer of 2011, Ward played Tamara, an antagonistic mermaid, in \"\", opposite Johnny Depp.\n\nWard briefly dated Heath Ledger. They first met in November 2007 in New York, and Ward later said they had \"developed a relationship and we started seeing each other.\" The two spent Christmas together in their home town of Perth before returning to New York where Ledger died less than a month later, on 22 January 2008.\n\nWard and her partner David Letts became parents in early December 2013 when she gave birth to a baby girl, followed by a second child, a son, in January 2017. In early 2020, she announced via Instagram they were expecting a baby girl.\n\nWard is close friends with fellow Australian models Jessica Gomes and Nicole Trunfio, with Gomes and Ward being bridesmaids at Trunfio's wedding.\n\n\n"}

Each such chemical has at least one silicon-chlorine bond. Trichlorosilane is produced on the largest scale. The parent chlorosilane is Silicon tetrachloride ().\n\nThey are prepared by the Müller-Rochow process, which involves treating silicon with hydrogen chloride at elevated temperatures in the presence of a copper catalyst. The idealized equation is\nTrichlorosilane (HSiCl) is the main product; dichlorosilane (HSiCl) and silicon tetrachloride (SiCl) are obtained as byproducts. The process was independently discovered by Eugene G. Rochow and Richard Müller in 1940.\n\nMethyltrichlorosilane (CHSiCl), dimethyldichlorosilane ((CH)SiCl), and trimethylsilyl chloride ((CH)SiCl) are produced by the Direct Process. They are key reagents in organosilicon chemistry.\n\nChlorosilanes react with water to produce hydrogen chloride, giving siloxanes and eventually silicon dioxide. In the case of trimethylsilyl chloride, the hydrolyzed product is hexamethyldisiloxane:\nThe analogous reaction of dimethyldichlorosilane gives siloxane polymers or rings:\n\nSilicon tetrachloride and trichlorosilane are intermediates in the production of ultrapure silicon in the semiconductor industry. Chlorosilanes obtained from crude silicon are purified by fractional distillation techniques and then reduced with hydrogen to give silicon of purity.\n\nOrganic chlorosilanes are frequently used as coatings for silicon and glass surfaces, and in the production of silicone (polysiloxane) polymers. While phenyl chlorosilanes and many others can be used, methylsiloxanes are produced in the greatest quantities.\n\nMethyl chlorosilanes have one to three methyl groups. In the case of dichlorodimethylsilane, two chlorine atoms are available, so that a reaction with excess water produces a linear chain of ether-like linkages between silicon atoms. As in polyethers, these flexible linkages produce a rubbery polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Trichloromethylsilane can be used to induce branching and cross-linking in PDMS molecules, while chlorotrimethylsilane serves to end backbone chains, limiting molecular weight.\n\nOther acid-forming species, especially acetate, can replace chlorine in silicone synthesis with little difference in the chemistry of the finished polymer. These analogues of chlorosilanes are quite common in the sealants and adhesives marketed to consumers, and as precursors for medical-grade silicone, because of reduced toxicity.\n"}

He sported a 12 cm scar on the side of his face.\n\nMoran was the son of Lewis Moran and Judy Moran. Mark Moran was his half-brother. Moran attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. He met his future wife, Trisha Kane, at 15 years of age. She is the daughter of Les Kane, a Melbourne painter and docker and reputed criminal who was murdered in his family home on 19 October 1978.\n\nDuring the 1990s Moran emerged as one of Melbourne's main dealers in \"party\" drugs. During this time he had a team of up-and-coming western suburbs gangsters.\n\nMoran was reported to have shot Carl Williams in the stomach during an argument in Gladstone Park on 13 October 1999, giving rise to lengthy violent turf wars known as the Melbourne gangland killings.\n\nAlphonse Gangitano and Moran, along with associate Mark John McNamara, were charged over an attack in the Sports Bar nightclub in King Street, Melbourne, on 19 December 1995, for which Moran received a term of imprisonment.\n\nMoran was considered by many to be a \"dead man walking\" and when paroled from prison in September 2001 was allowed to leave Australia due to fears for his life. He later returned to give evidence in the inquest into the death of Gangitano on 20 November which began on 14 January 2002. Moran was suspected in Gangitano's murder. Gangitano was found dead in the laundry of his Templestowe house by his wife in 1998.\nAccording to former Moran associate Bertie Wrout, however, it was Kinniburgh who killed Gangitano and it was Mark—not Jason—Moran who was his accomplice.\n\nPasquale Barbaro and Moran were gunned down on 21 June 2003 at Cross Keys Reserve in Essendon, where they had been watching Moran's young children play football. On returning to their motor vehicle they were shot dead by a lone gunman. Security footage from a neighbouring hotel showed the van they had driven to the football grounds and a figure running away from the vehicle. Police feared that the murders would lead to further violence in the Melbourne underworld war. Father Joe Giaccobe, a friend of the Moran family officiated at Moran's funeral.\nDuring the service another priest, Father John Martin, said:\n\nMoran's father, Lewis Moran, was unable to attend the service due to incarceration at Port Phillip Correctional Centre. Authorities refused his request, for security reasons, to be released from prison to attend the service. Lewis Moran was later murdered while drinking in a Brunswick bar.\n\nOn 28 February 2007, Carl Williams pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of Victoria to the murder of Moran (but not of Barbaro). The actual shooting was done by a killer often known as the \"Runner\" with Williams having organised the killing. Williams was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 35 years, on 7 May 2007. He was later murdered while incarcerated at Barwon prison on 19 April 2010.\n\nIn the drama series \"Underbelly\" Jason Moran was played by Les Hill. Hill later reprised that role in the 2014 series \"Fat Tony & Co.\".\n\n"}

World War II postponed her acting career, and she did not make her stage debut until 1945 with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, working under director Barry Jackson. At the close of the war she quickly became a regular presence on the West End, making her debut in 1946 as Lynne Hartley in Warren Chetham-Strode's \"The Guinea Pig\" at the Criterion Theatre. \n\nIn the same year she married novelist Denys Rhodes but their marriage ended in 1950 in divorce. They had one daughter together, actress Sharon Gurney (a daughter-in-law of Michael Gough). Her other stage credits during this time include Lady Katherine in \"A Sleeping Clergyman\" at the Criterion Theatre in 1947, the fiancée in Peter Watling's \"Rain on the Just\" at the Old Vic in 1948, and Thea in \"Black Chiffon\" at the Westminster Theatre in 1949.\n\nGurney continued to appear regularly on the London stage during the 1950s.

In 1952 she portrayed the roles of Mabel in \"First Person Singular\" and Mrs. Pless in \"The Trap\" at the Duke of York's Theatre. She also appeared as Alice in \"The Voysey Inheritance\" at the Arts Theatre and as Mrs. George Lamb in \"Caro William\" at the Embassy Theatre. The following year she played Valerie Carrington in the groundbreaking play \"Carrington VC\" at the Westminster Theatre. She remained busy over the next several years appearing as Avice Brunton in \"The Bombshell\" (1954), Portia in \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1955) and Olivia in \"The Chalk Garden\" (1956). In 1959 she replaced Celia Johnson as Hilary in \"The Grass is Greener\" at the St. Martin's Theatre.\n\nGurney also began to appear in both films and television in the 1950s.

T & A had Trish Stratus as their team manager, with their name being a pun on the initials of the two wrestlers and the slang expression \"T&A\" (referring to tits and ass), spawning numerous coarse jokes on fan's signs and from commentator Jerry Lawler in reference to the buxom Trish Stratus.\n\nTest and Albert met in Dory Funk, Jr.'s training center, the Funkin' Conservatory, where they were trained. Following this, both men took on individual careers in the business leading them to the WWF, where they were repackaged as a tag team during 2000. On the March 19, 2000 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\" Stratus made her debut with the gimmick of scouting wrestlers to form a team. Shortly after this Test and Albert (who both wrestled on that show) became her wards. Their first match as a team was on the March 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\", when they lost to the Hardy Boyz. Their first pay-per-view match was at WrestleMania 2000, when they defeated Steve Blackman and Al Snow. They competed against established teams in the WWF's tag team division, including Road Dogg and X-Pac, The Godfather and D'Lo Brown, and The Holly Cousins, before beginning a feud with the Dudley Boyz. In a match against the Dudley Boyz at the Backlash 2000 pay-per-view Stratus was the recipient of a powerbomb through a table from Bubba Ray Dudley, although T & A won the match.\n\nThey continued competing against teams including the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz for the next few months, and on June 25, they competed for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a four-way elimination match at King of the Ring, but were the first team eliminated after Matt Hardy pinned Test. Test, Albert and Stratus began a feud with the Hardy Boyz, Matt and Jeff, and their manager Lita, which led to a six-person intergender tag team match at Fully Loaded, which T & A lost when Lita pinned Stratus.\n\nDuring a feud with the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), the two men parodied the team under the name T & APA (Test & Albert Protection Agency). As part of this feud, all three members of T & A were supposed to face Bradshaw and Faarooq of the APA and Lita in a six-person tag team match on October 22, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, but T & A attacked the APA backstage, so the match never started. They then attacked Lita at ringside until the Hardy Boyz saved her.\n\nA feud with The Holly Cousins (Hardcore, Crash and Molly) followed, and at Survivor Series, the Holly Cousins, with Steve Blackman replacing Hardcore, defeated T & A in a six-person match when Molly pinned Stratus.\n\nIn December 2000, Albert turned on Test, causing storyline internal injuries which resulted in bleeding from Test's mouth. Trish continued to manage Albert for a while, but eventually began a storyline involving Vince McMahon and eventually broke out as a wrestler on her own. Albert went on to join X-Pac and Justin Credible in their own stable, X-Factor. Test defeated William Regal to win the European title. He went on to feud with Eddie Guerrero over the European title before eventually joining The Alliance and later The Un-Americans.\n\nTest was released in November 2004 and returned in 2006 and left again in 2007. He died on March 13, 2009 in his Florida apartment. Albert was released in 2004, but returned in 2012 as Lord Tensai or just Tensai, and would become the head coach for the WWE developmental branch in 2014 NXT.\n"}

On July 9, 2017 the APRL Thrift Store closed after a 10-year run as a nonprofit small business.\n\nThrough APRL's GO VEGAN, College Outreach, and Vegan Outreach campaigns, volunteers distribute pamphlets to spread the word about the benefits of a plant-based diet to patrons at popular gathering spots like Downtown Disney, Knott's Berry Farm, The Outlets at Orange, the Irvine Spectrum, swap meets and college campuses. We estimate that for every 200 pamphlets distributed, one person goes vegan. That's 100 animals saved per year, or thousands over the course of a new vegan's life. APRL has given out hundreds of thousands of pamphlets and through this alone, we’ve saved millions of lives\n\nThe SoCal VegFest is run by dedicated volunteers as a project of Animal Protection and Rescue League. SoCal VegFest is a yearly event, normally in mid-fall, designed to engage curiosity and inspire consciousness in people of all ages. The event include free plant-based food samplings, musical entertainment, guest speakers, cooking demonstrations, raffles, interactive booths, food vendors, humane organizations, an enjoyable children’s area with a variety of engaging opportunities especially for kids, and more. The purpose of SoCal VegFest is to introduce Southern Californians and others to the benefits of healthy conscious living. Our goal is to inspire and support anyone who wants to learn more about living a more healthy, environmentally friendly, and compassionate life.\n\nAPRL's Stop Foie Gras campaign has released groundbreaking video footage of extreme cruelty from all three foie gras farms in the U.S. and several in France. APRL was instrumental in passing legislation in California and Chicago against this cruelty. See www.banfoiegras.org for more info on this campaign.\n\nAPRL is a member of Californians for Humane Farms, a coalition of animal protection groups working to pass the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act—an initiative that will appear on California's November 2008 ballot. APRL led the signature gathering phase of the Yes on Prop 2 (Farm Animal Cruelty Prevention Act) campaign in Southern California.\nIn 2017 APRL is again taking part in the signature gathering phase of the updated Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act.\n\nAPRL erected two billboards on December 30, 2014, next to the I-5 freeway in Los Angeles. Together, APRL estimates, they are getting 300,000 impressions per day, or 2 million impressions per week. It would be great to keep them up longer and move them around to increase their exposure. The Orange County chapter of Animal Protection & Rescue League (with assistance from PETA, which provided a generous grant) spent most of its annual budget already on the billboards and lacks the funds to keep them up.\n\nTo protect marine animals from ingesting plastics and debris, which causes grave harm, APRL organizes monthly beach cleanups. They supply buckets, trash bags, gloves, reach extending sticks, and sanitizing wipes for volunteers to cleanup the Southern California beaches. Volunteers are asked to help clean up the beaches in the morning. Then at noon have a vegan lunch.\n\nAPRL protests rodeos, bull riding, animal circuses, sea world, and elephant rides. They work with local government to end the use of exotic animals and end all cruel practices at fairs and Zoos.\n\nAPRL save strays, educates about Spaying and Neutering pets, and promote pet adoption to reduce killing in the wild and in shelters. APRL has gotten many OC cities to ban the retail sale of dogs and cats and many pet stores to closes after advocacy and protest campaigns. \nThere is a colony of more than 30 feral cats living in the rugged landscape of Catalina (\"Cat\") Harbor on Catalina Island. Some of the cats have sustained permanent injuries from dog attacks and sadistic people. APRL started a fundraising campaign to provide needed services such as food, shelter, and medical aid.\n\nAPRL protested killing of Kapparot chickens and sought legal actions.\nSome of the other organizations APRL has supported: \n\nInjunction was filed March 10, 2008.\n\n\n"}

Similarly, in finance, the reservation price—also called the indifference price—is the value at which an investor would be willing to buy (or sell) a financial security given his or her particular utility function.\n\nReservation prices are commonly used in auctions, where the seller may or may not make it known what the lowest acceptable price is. Buyers—especially if by proxy—may have their own reservation price at which they are unwilling to further bid. This can be seen as the \"walk away\" point for either party, in negotiation where the reservation price is the point beyond which a negotiator is ready to walk away from a negotiated agreement. A seller may produce a reservation demand, which is a schedule of reservation prices at which a seller would be willing to sell different quantities of a particular good.\n\nReservation prices vary for the buyers and sellers according to their disposable income, their desire for—or to sell—the good, and knowledge of information about substitute goods. A reservation price can be used to help calculate the consumer surplus or the producer surplus with reference to the equilibrium price.\n\nIn the basic model of optimal auction design developed by Roger Myerson (1981), the optimal reservation price (i.e., the smallest admissible bid) is independent of the number of bidders. Myerson assumes that the bidders have private independent values (i.e., each bidder’s valuation of the object to be auctioned off is a realization of a random variable observed only by the bidder, and the random variables are stochastically independent). For example, if every bidder’s valuation is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,100], then the optimal reservation price is 50. According to traditional economic theory, the optimal reservation price results from balancing two opposing effects. First, a higher reservation price is desirable for the seller since it deters bidders from falsely claiming that they have only a small valuation. Second, a higher reservation price is undesirable for the seller since it deters bidders with truly small valuations from participating in the auction. According to behavioral economic theory, a reservation price may also have additional effects. In particular, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have argued that a reservation price can serve as a reference point when bidders have preferences as studied in prospect theory. \n\n\n"}

BB&N is regularly ranked among the top independent schools in the United States. The School has produced three of the 27 Presidential Scholars from Massachusetts since the inception of the program in 1964 and is a member of the G20 Schools group and the Round Square global education association. BB&N includes six Rhodes Scholars among its graduates.\n\nThe School occupies four campuses: a Lower School on Buckingham Street, a Middle School on Sparks Street, an Upper School on Gerry's Landing Road, and an office building on Belmont Street. In 2017 the school consisted of 1017 students, 146 faculty, and 148 administrators and staff.\n\nBB&N was founded in 1974 from the merger of two schools, Browne & Nichols School and the Buckingham School. Prior to the merger, Browne & Nichols was a boys school consisting of grades 7-12; Buckingham School enrolled students in grades K-12: boys and girls in grades K-6 and girls only in grades 7-12.\n\nFederal judge Nathaniel M. Gorton is the former chair of the school's board of trustees.\n\nBrowne & Nichols School (B&N) was founded in 1883 by George Henry Browne, a 25-year-old Harvard graduate who, having embarked on a career as a teacher of Latin and English literature, attracted the attention of his former professors Francis J. Child and Charles Eliot Norton. Seeking an alternative to the Cambridge public schools, Child and Norton recruited Browne to teach their three sons and two other boys. At the end of that year, Browne enlisted his Harvard classmate Edgar H. Nichols to join him as the co-head of a new college preparatory school, which opened in the fall with an enrollment of 17, a number that quickly expanded.\n\nThe Buckingham School was named and incorporated in 1902, but the first schoolhouse was opened in 1892, known as Miss Markham's School after its founding headmistress. Because Jeanette Markham had been conducting classes for small children in a private school since at least 1889, that is the year from which Buckingham dates its beginning.\n\nMarkham came to Cambridge from Atchison, Kansas to pursue an education at the recently founded women's college later named Radcliffe. Upon arriving in Cambridge, she found a home with Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson on Buckingham Street, to whom she is said to have become “virtually an elder daughter” (59). After she began teaching in a neighbor's home, another neighbor, Mrs. Richard H. Dana, offered to build a schoolhouse and living quarters nearby, where the school began with 12 students. That schoolhouse continues to be part of BB&N's Lower School campus to this day.\n\nDuring the year 1882-1883, before Browne & Nichols came into formal existence, founder George H. Browne taught his small group of students in two rooms in Harvard's Felton Hall. With the formation of the school in 1883, instruction took place at 11 Appian Way, with the addition of another building at 8 Garden Street. Radcliffe College, which now occupies this land, wished to expand here, and so it made an exchange with B&N, which relocated in 1897 to a new brick building at 20 Garden Street. That building was designed by Edgar Nichols's sister-in-law, Minerva Parker Nichols, and is said to be “the first important building by a woman architect.” None of these buildings remains today, except for the 11 Appian Way building, relocated around the corner to 3 Garden Street and now serving as an Episcopal Church rectory.\n\nIn 1911-1913 the school was incorporated and acquired several acres of farmland near Gerry's Landing, a property dedicated as the “Nichols Athletic Field,” a name by which it is still known. In 1924 the school acquired the contiguous three acres with a gift from Mrs. Kuno Francke in memory of her son Hugo, after whom the field is still named. Francke Field was expanded to its present dimensions through an exchange of property with the Shady Hill School, which by this time had moved to its current location directly next to B&N's two athletic fields.\n\nA 1928 plan to move B&N to the Gerry's Landing property foundered in the wake of the Great Depression, but enough money was raised to relocate the Lower School there. Finally, in 1948, a large donation allowed the rest of the school to follow, and the Garden Street campus was sold. Major additions to the new campus's structure followed: a gymnasium and locker room in 1952; the Almy Building in 1956, initially constructed to house grades 7-9; an expansion of the 1928 boathouse in 1959; the Pratt Building in 1960 for the lower school; the Bradford Building in 1962, which included an auditorium and the school's first library; and the enclosed Bright Hockey-Tennis facility in 1966, all of them now part of the Upper School campus. Multiple additional renovations and expansions have occurred over the past 50 years, most notably the Nicholas Athletic Center and Renaissance Hall.\n\nThe Buckingham School started in a wooden two-story building constructed on the site of a pear orchard at the corner of Buckingham Street and Buckingham Place and opened in 1892. That building, today known as Markham House, still stands. In 1921 the school expanded three additional grades to include college preparation and needing additional space acquired the contiguous property along Parker Street, where it built the large brick building that still occupies the site. In 1924 the school purchased four acres of land on Larch Road, near Fresh Pond, for use in physical education, which continues to serve BB&N's athletic program despite the City of Cambridge House Authority's narrowly averted attempt in 1968 to seize the land by eminent domain to build housing for the aged. In 1929 the school acquired another private home known then and ever since as Kelsey House.\n\nJust one year after B&N made its most important expansion, the Buckingham School did the same, with the purchase of a large residence, constructed in 1859, on nearby Sparks Street. This became Buckingham's Upper School. In 1954 it was expanded with a new wing, named after former headmistress Marian Vaillant when the wing was again expanded in 1969. That same year the acquisition of property along Craigie Street provided space for the kindergarten and grades one and two in the newly constructed Morse Building.\n\nWhen Peter K. Gunness, Director of Financial Aid at Harvard, was appointed to succeed Edwin Pratt, who retired after twenty years as B&N's headmaster in 1969, Buckingham headmistress Elizabeth Stowe suggested that the two schools should begin exploring cooperative opportunities beyond the joint musical and dramatic ventures that had begun during the Pratt years. For the next two years the schools collaborated on several classes on the two campuses, and the drama clubs formally merged.\n\nDuring the 1971-1972 school year, fifteen classes included students from both schools, and the following year all sixty eleventh and twelfth graders at Buckingham took their classes on the B&N campus with their male counterparts. Discussions about a formal merger began early in 1973, resulting in the creation of the new coeducational school Buckingham Browne & Nichols, effective January 1, 1974. Elizabeth Stowe's retirement resulted in Peter Gunness's appointment as the first head of the new school.\n\nThe Gerry's Landing Road campus became BB&N's Upper School, the Sparks Street campus the Middle School, and the Buckingham and Craigie Streets campus the Lower School. They have remained in these locations.\n\nA fourth campus occupies a former parochial school at 46 Belmont Street in Watertown, where BB&N's support staff, including business, human resources, alumni/ae affairs, archives, and other departments are located. In addition, a cooperative day care center, founded by faculty for their children (but also open to others), uses the bottom floor.\n\nA distinctive feature of BB&N's Upper School is the Bivouac program, which B&N inaugurated in 1951 on privately owned land in Temple, Maine. The program's goals, as expressed from the beginning, are to “help students develop a sense of confidence in their own ability to cope with unexpected and challenging situations and to cultivate in the students an awareness of all members of a community.”\n\nInitially reserved for eighth graders, since 1957 the program has included all ninth graders. In 1975 it moved to school property at the former Camp Marienfeld, in Harrisville, New Hampshire.\n\nAfter the two schools merged, boys and girls participated in separate Bivouacs, until 1980 when they were combined. For eleven days the ninth grade, under the supervision of faculty and eleventh and twelfth grade “junior guides,” lives outdoors, organized in squads of seven or eight students, and participates in courses, team- and trust-building exercises, and elective activities such as going on an overnight solo. Students entering BB&N after ninth grade participate in a shortened version of the program.\n\nThe Upper School's academic program includes approximately 150 courses offered each year within six departments. The World Language Department offers courses on at least four levels in six different languages: Arabic, Chinese, French, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. In 2016 seventeen different Advanced Placement courses were offered. Offerings in the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department run from Algebra I to Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. The History Department includes a global history requirement and multiple elective offerings.\n\nVisual Arts courses include Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, Photography, Art Across Boundaries, Film and Video, Design and Architecture, and Woodworking. Performing Art courses include Chamber Music, Chorale, Drama, a Jazz Ensemble, and a full Orchestra.\n\nAthletics are offered across all three seasons in 25 different sports, most with varsity and junior varsity teams, and some with a third team. The majority of teams compete in the 16-school Independent School League, of which BB&N has been a member since the League was founded in 1948.\n\nAfter spring break in March, seniors undertake a Spring Project that they designed during the fall and winter. Most projects consist of some ongoing features, such as AP courses or athletics, along with specially designed classes, internships, community service, and numerous other options. Students may also devote their entire projects to ventures off-campus, sometimes in foreign countries.\n\nComplementing the Upper School's language program, each of the six language offerings sponsor annual or biennial travel opportunities to China, France, Greece or Italy (Latin), the Middle East (Arabic), Russia, and Spain. The Russian trip, one of several student exchanges, began in 1988 as a way of easing Cold War tensions. In addition, AP Art History makes an annual trip to Italy, and most spring varsity sports make a spring training trip. A special financial aid program enables students who cannot afford these trips to participate.\n\nOther trip destinations have included Switzerland and Costa Rica. \n\nBB&N's student publications have enjoyed a long history and won many national honors. The official student newspaper, The Vanguard, established at the time of the merger, publishes an issue nearly every month. Its predecessors stretch back to B&N's The Spectator, founded in 1906, which evolved into a literary magazine in 1959 and remains such today. \n\nThe CHASM, Current Happenings Across STEM Magazine, is the school's STEM based publication.\n\nThe Spectator, BB&N's art and literary magazine, has been in production ever since its foundation in 1906 by two students of Browne and Nichols. In 2017, the magazine was awarded with a gold medal from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.\n\nIn 1950 B&N students published their first annual yearbook, titled The Torch, a reference to B&N's school seal designed by renowned sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin. A yearbook has been produced every year since and is now called The Perspective. \n\nIn 2007, a triannual political magazine was founded known as The Point of View. In addition, a satirical newspaper called The Mouthguard and a television news program called The Knightly News are produced intermittently. \n\nFor several years Middle School students have also published a newspaper known as The Spark.\n\nParticipation in sports is required at BB&N, though students can obtain waivers for extensive arts commitments or for community service. BB&N is a member of the Independent School League, and the boys' teams have a long-lasting traditional rivalry with the Belmont Hill School.\n\nThe varsity baseball team won ISL titles in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, going undefeated with a perfect 15-0 record, 2015 and 2016 (shared).\n\nThe team has won several ISL championships for basketball. Both the girls and boys team have combined to see nine 1,000 point scorers and many players go on to play at the collegiate level.\n\nThe BB&N Fencing Team fields Épée, Sabre, and Foil squads for both men and women. Over the years, the team has had numerous individual state champions, a national Division III champion and, in 2013, 2014 and 2017, won the Massachusetts High School State Championship.\n\nThe varsity football team won the NEPSAC Class B Super Bowl in 2006, the Class A Super Bowl and ISL Title in 2008, and the 2010 Jack Etter Bowl, named for BB&N's long time athletic director. The 2016 Knights football team completed their 2016 campaign as ISL Champions and capped the season with a win in the Ken O’Keefe NEPSAC Class A Super Bowl, finishing up with a final record of 7-2. The 2018 Knights finished their season with a 8-1 record winning the ISL and the Class A Championship. 2018 marked the 15th straight season without a losing record and was the 5th bowl victory in the last 12 years.\n\nThe co-ed Golf team won their first ISL Kingman Tournament title in 2008- and then 2 more times in 2014 and 2015. In 2015 and 2016 they won the Team Stroke Play Championship (The Kingman Tournament) In 2015, for the first time in school history, the team united the ISL Championship Trophy with the Kingsman Trophy.\n\nThe name of the school's athletic teams, \"the Knights,\" has its origins in a 1920s \"Boston Globe\" article which referred to the rowing team in particular, undefeated against the likes of Harvard, MIT and Kent School, as \"the Black Knights of the Charles,\" itself a reference to the Army Black Knights. In addition to taking the team name, Browne & Nichols also took black and white as its colors after the article. The Buckingham School's colors, blue and gold, were made the combined school's colors after the merger. The school was the first American schoolboy crew to win the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, England, winning the Thames Challenge Cup in 1929. The Washington Post commented:\n\n\"The Thames Challenge Cup, prize of England's famous rowing tournament, was captured today by eight young\nthumbnail\n\nIn 2004, the boys' varsity soccer team, led by head coach Jesse Sarzana, won the New England Class A Championship. The soccer team won the first outright ISL title in school history in 2007 on their way to a Class A finals appearance. The team won their second ISL championship in 2009 but lost in the class A semi-finals.\n\nThe boys varsity tennis team won the New England Class B Tournament in 2004, the 2005 ISL Championship, and finished second in the 2007 New England Class B Tournament.\n\nIn 2004, the varsity sailing team was undefeated in the regular season. They also won 1st place in the first division of the Mass Bay League regatta in 2017. \n\nIn the past four years, BB&N wrestling has had 6 league champions, 4 league runners-up, and multiple league placers, and has had multiple representatives at the national tournament and New England tournament.\n\nBB&N formed a robotics team and has begun participating at a varsity level in competitions between other schools as of 2019.\n\nBB&N also has both girls' and boys' hockey teams, although the boys team has had a losing record in the past 4 years and has had 3 different coaches throughout that time.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed the \"Black Prince of Lygon Street\", Gangitano was the face of an underground organisation known as the Carlton Crew. He was also an associate of alleged organised crime bosses Tom Domican (Sydney) and John Kizon (Perth).\n\nGangitano is considered to be the second of the thirty Melbourne gangland killings between 1998–2010, when he was murdered in 1998. Gangitano was portrayed by Vince Colosimo in the 2008 TV series \"Underbelly\" and by Elan Zavelsky in the 2009 TV series \"\".\n\nGangitano was born on 22 April 1957. He attended De La Salle College and Marcellin College. In later years through the 1980s and 1990s, it was later alleged that he was a co-owner of a King Street nightclub and numerous fight promotions and other ventures that went on to include horse racing and protection rackets. At the height of Gangitano's criminal career, he was earning an estimated $125,000–$200,000 a month as a high profile member of The Carlton Crew. Unlike other criminals, Gangitano purely wanted to be a criminal from a young age.\n\nGangitano, Moran and associate Tony Rapasarda were charged over serious assaults on several patrons at the Sports Bar nightclub in King Street, Melbourne on 19 December 1995.\n\nMoran later said of Gangitano: \"He's a fucking lulu ... if you smash five pool cues and an iron bar over someone's head...you're a fucking lulu\". The attack was portrayed on \"Underbelly\".\n\nOn the day of his death, 16 January 1998, Gangitano was reported to have had a telephone conversation with Kizon. That same day, Graham Kinniburgh drank at the Laurel Hotel in Ascot Vale with associate Lou Cozzo before driving to Gangitano's home in Templestowe. At a subsequent coroners' inquest, evidence was presented that Kinniburgh and Jason Moran were in Gangitano's home that night. Both were exempted from giving evidence at the inquest, on the grounds that their evidence might incriminate them. \n\nKinniburgh left Gangitano's house shortly after 11 pm to purchase cigarettes at a 7-11. Upon his return 30 minutes later, he found that Gangitano had been shot several times in the head in the laundry. Gangitano's \"de facto\" wife, Virginia, was with the body. Traces of Kinniburgh's blood were later discovered on the back flyscreen door at Gangitano's home.\n\nKinniburgh reportedly respected the code of silence, frustrating police investigating the murder. Gangitano's pallbearers included Mick Gatto and John Kizon. Gangitano is survived by his wife and two daughters, and was widely believed to have had another child with which he had no contact to an unidentified woman.\n\nMoran allegedly pulled out a gun after an argument with Alphonse and shot him in the arm and head as he fled towards the laundry. The murder may have led to as many as 75 revenge assaults on underworld members. In 1995, Gangitano was charged with shooting dead petty criminal Gregory John Workman at 1 Wando Grove, St Kilda East; however, Gangitano never went to trial over the shooting after two witnesses retracted their statements.\n\nKinniburgh and Moran were both later murdered themselves.\n\n"}
{"id": "2083792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083792", "title": "Queen Victoria Building", "text": "Queen Victoria Building\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building (abbreviated as the QVB) is a heritage-listed late-nineteenth-century building designed by the architect George McRae located at 429–481 George Street in the Sydney central business district, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The Romanesque Revival building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 and is wide by long. The domes were built by Ritchie Brothers, a steel and metal company that also built trains, trams and farm equipment. The building fills a city block bounded by George, Market, York and Druitt Streets. Designed as a marketplace, it was used for a variety of other purposes, underwent remodelling and suffered decay until its restoration and return to its original use in the late twentieth century. The property is owned by the City of Sydney and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010.\n\nThe site has been under the control of the Council of the City of Sydney since 1842, when Sydney Town was incorporated. It was previously the location for municipal markets, the first of which, a \"simple storehouse\", was put up by Gregory Blaxland. Under Governor Macquarie's leadership, it was subsequently envisaged as a \"grand civic square\" by architect Francis Greenway. In the 1830s, \"four substantial stone halls\" were built to the design of Ambrose Hallen and later the site was selected for the construction of \"a marvellous centre of trade\".\n\nThe building, on the \"scale of a cathedral\" was designed by George McRae, a Scottish architect who had emigrated to Sydney in 1884. At the time, Sydney was undergoing a building boom and since in architecture \"no one school or style predominated\", McRae produced four designs for the building in different styles (Gothic, Renaissance, Queen Anne and Romanesque) from which the Council could choose. The Council's choice of Victorian Romanesque style conveys the influences of American architect Henry Hobson Richardson. The use of columns, arches, and a prodigal amount of detail such as was used by McRae in the chosen design are typical of Richardsonian Romanesque, an eclectic style identifiably established between 1877 and 1886.\n\nThe dominant feature of the building is the central dome which consists of an interior glass dome and a copper-sheathed exterior, topped by a domed cupola. Smaller domes of various sizes are on the rooftop, including ones on each upper corner of the rectangular building. Stained-glass windows, including a cartwheel window depicting the arms of the City of Sydney, allow light into the central area, and the roof itself incorporates arched skylights running lengthways north and south from the central dome. The colonnades, arches, balustrades and cupolas are of typically intricate Victorian style.\n\nThe site, an entire city block, had previously been occupied by a produce market and the Central Police Court. These uses ceased in 1891 and the land was purchased by Sydney City Council. The \"Australasian Builder and Contractors' News\" described the four designs in July 1893 as \"scholarly Renaissance\", \"picturesque Queen Anne\", \"classic Gothic\" and \"American Romanesque\". The style chosen was the latter and the foundation stone was laid in December 1893 by the Mayor, Sir William Manning. This foundation stone was a five-tonne block of granite, levered and lowered into position at the corner of George and Druitt Streets. The ceremony was the first of a series in which successive mayors laid stones and plaques to mark the progress of construction. The building was notable for its employment in the expansive barrel-form roof of engineering systems which were very advanced at the time of construction. McRae is considered by architectural historians to have been one of the leading protagonists of the new construction methods and materials which were then beginning to break down the conservatism of building techniques. In achieving the strength and space of the building McRae used steel, iron, concrete, reinforcing, machine-made bricks, glass, imported tiles, fire-proofing, riveting and hydraulics on an unprecedented scale. The huge building was finally completed and opened with great ceremony on Mayor Matthew Harris on 21 July 1898. In a lavish ceremony, Alderman Harris said that the building was intended to be more than a municipal market. With judicious management, he said \"a marvellous centre of trade will be established here.\"\n\nIn 1897, the Council resolved to \"dedicate the new market buildings\", then still under construction, to Queen Victoria and to name them The Queen Victoria Market Buildings in commemoration of her Diamond Jubilee:\n\nThe Councillors decided not to ask for the Queen's assent, in part because it would have made it \"necessary to have the Royal Coat of Arms on the building\". After the markets originally held in the building were relocated in 1910, the name was amended in 1918 to \"Queen Victoria Buildings\". Finally, in 1987, the Council rescinded the 1918 resolution and named it the \"Queen Victoria Building\".\n\nThe building was constructed between 1893 and 1898 by the Phippard Brothers (Henry, born 1854 and Edwin, born 1864), \"the leading building contractors of Sydney\", whose quarries at Bowral and Waverley supplied the trachyte and sandstone respectively.\n\nThe building was officially opened on Thursday 21 July 1898. and provided a business environment for tailors, mercers, hairdressers, florists and coffee shops as well as showrooms and a concert hall. In the evening there was a grand ball for more than a thousand guests held in the adjacent Town Hall. at which the then Lord Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, made a speech that reflected \"faith in the future, the great theme of the Victorian age of optimism\", by saying:\n\nThe Druitt Street entrance was opened by the Lady Mayoress using a commemorative solid gold key on which was a model of the main dome and the smaller cupolas, \"worth a good deal more than £50\", made by Fairfax and Roberts and presented by the Phippard Brothers. The building was illuminated by about 1,000 Welsbach incandescent burners, equal in lighting power to about 70,000 candles, producing \"floods of light\" that even in the basement was judged to be \"perfect\".\n\nA public lending library was planned as early as 1899 and both the City of Sydney Library and the Electricity Department were long-time occupants.\n\nMei Quong Tart's tearoom, Elite Hall, was formally opened by the Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, in 1898. The tea rooms were on the ground floor near the centre of the markets, fronting George Street. A plush-carpeted staircase led to the function hall on the first floor. The Elite Hall had capacity for nearly 500 people and included a stage with an elaborately carved proscenium. At the other end was the Elite Dining Saloon, described as having ‘elegant appointments’.\n\nThe original concept was for an internal shopping street -long with two levels of shops on either side. In 1917 and 1935 alterations converted the interior to office space with shops to the external street frontages.\n\nIn the first few decades the QVB had the atmosphere of an oriental bazaar, and the earliest tenants conducted a mixture of commerce, crafts and skills. There were shops, studios, offices and workrooms for some two hundred traders, dealers and artisans. Housed within the upper galleries were more studious and scholarly tenancies, such as bookshops, sheet music shops, piano-sellers and piano-tuners, as well as the salons of private teachers of music, dancing, singing, elocution, painting, sculpting, drawing and dressmaking. There were also more decorous sports including a billiards saloon, a gymnasium for ladies and a table tennis hall.\n\nThe building was heavily criticised in the early years of its operation due to its poor financial return. Original real estate advice indicated the building could pay for itself from rents received, within thirty years. The first few years were slow. In 1898 only 47 out of about 200 available spaces were tenanted. This improved by the following year with another 20 tenants joining the list. By 1905, there were 150 tenants, but it was not until 1917 that the building was reaching its maximum tenancy rate. Up until that time there was a continual shortfall between the costs to Council and the rents received and Council was constantly looking at ways of improving its return.\n\nAs early as 1902, the City Council was worrying about the building being a \"non-paying asset and handicap\". In ensuing years various schemes for selling, remodelling and/or demolition were proposed and reports produced. The markets originally held in the building were relocated to Haymarket in 1910. In 1912 it was described as an \"incubus\" and in 1915 and 1916 as a \"municipal 'white elephant'\". In 1913 a \"decision to re-model was arrived at by 10 votes to 9\" over the options to demolish or sell. Although it had been accepted that nothing could be done until after the war, in 1917 the Council accepted a tender for alterations to the building.\nA remodelling scheme was finally adopted by Council in May 1917. McLeod Brothers were awarded the contract for the work in June 1917 at a cost of . The following alterations were undertaken:\n\n\nThese alterations in the name of economy and increased floor space destroyed much of the magnificent interior spaces and character of the building. The ground floor arcade was obliterated, the light quality in the basement reduced, the southern entry devalued and the internal voids and galleries reduced and devalued. The alterations were undertaken to remove what Council saw as, \"inherent flaws\", in what its Victorian creators considered, an architectural triumph. One of the disturbing aspects of these radical alterations was that now that the building's internal character had been violated and devalued, there was little resistance to further alterations.\n\nThe building continued to incur losses and by 1933 the accumulated debt was announced as . No major alterations occurred between 1918 and 1934, but many small alterations to the individual shops such as new partitions, fitouts, and mezzanines were continually taking place. By the mid 1930s the depression was receding, employment growing, building and business reviving. Time had come to rework the building to further reduce the debt and hopefully return a profit. The Council decided to move the rapidly expanding Electricity Department out of the Town Hall and relocate it in the QVB. In December 1933, Council voted to approve a major proposal to alter the Queen Victoria Building to suit the requirements of the Electricity Department. Approval was also given to invite tenders for the work. The majority of the work was confined to the central and northern section of the building. Essentially this scheme was to convert the interior to a general office space and install floors in what remained of the Grand Victorian internal spaces. The work costing (Pounds)125,000 was completed by 1935 and included the following changes:\n\n\nMany of the shops at ground floor level in the southern part of the building were retained although they received new shopfronts in line with the updated Art Deco image. The library in the northern area was retained with no new major alterations. The basement was subject to various alterations such as new concrete stairs, timber framed mezzanines and some new plant equipment, but the long term tenants remained in the basement ensuring little need for alterations.\n\nThese extensive alterations attracted little public comment at the time. They were accepted within the name of progress as a necessary solution. It is fortunate that the majority of the facade fabric was not altered above the awning line. Perhaps the strength of the architectural image was too strong even for the most practical minded official. An enduring quality the building has always retained is in its ability to change without losing its external imagery and architectural strength as an element in the city. Up until the early 1970s the building became the home of the SCC and much of its identity in the city was based on this use even though the external envelope had not changed.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1938 the areas occupied by the Sydney County Council were remodelled in an Art Deco style. The building steadily deteriorated and in 1959 was again threatened with demolition. Proposals to replace the building which many saw as \"overdue for demolition\" included ones for a fountain, a plaza and a car park. The occupancy by the SCC did however provide some security for the building by providing a constant income base. The SCC undertook continual changes to the building, some being significant alterations but the majority were minor such as new partitions, showrooms and fitouts. For example, in the thirty years between 1936 and 1966 a total of 79 separate building applications were lodged with the City Council by the SCC. There is little evidence that any of this work, which was basically related to functional uses and the needs of occupants, proceeded with any concern for the architectural strengths of the building.\n\nProposals for demolition of the building gained strength by the late 1950s in a city eager to modernise and grow rapidly. The post war boom was in full swing and business confidence high. In 1959, Lord Mayor Jensen suggested a scheme demolishing the QVB and replacing it with a public square. Revenue from a badly needed underground carpark would pay for the demolition of the QVB and construction of the square. This scheme gained much support both from the public and the design professions in general. Jensen further suggested an international design competition similar to the competition for the Opera House site and won much support for the idea.\n\nDemolition proposals at the time were largely postponed by the continued presence of the SCC in the building. The SCC required another long lease which was granted by the City Council in 1961. The SCC was planning a new large building opposite town hall and required the existing facilities in the QVB to be retained until its completion. The City Council was in no position to refuse the SCC and thus the demolition proposals were temporarily thwarted, although opinion was always behind demolition and a reuse of the site at the time. A form of demolition actually started in 1963 with removal of the cupolas on the roof. Concern about their stability was given as the reason for their removal. The contractor paid for their removal, in fact made a larger profit out of the sale of the salvaged cupolas as souvenirs and garden decorations, than for the contract to remove them. As the new SCC building was nearing completion the question of the QVB's ultimate fate was approaching again. The debates in the late 1950s and early 1960s were largely deflated by the continued occupation of the SCC and other long term tenants, but, as this was not an issue any more, the debate was to enter another stage.\n\nBy 1967 calls for its preservation were being made by the National Trust of Australia declaring it should be saved because of its historical importance. Calls were also made not only for its preservation but also for its restoration by stripping away the numerous disfigurements, restoring the glass vaulted roof, ground floor arcades, tiled floors, and stone stairs. Many schemes were promoted such as linking the building by tunnels to the Town Hall and other city buildings, schemes involving constructing nightclubs or planetariums under the dome, with shops on the lower levels, art galleries, hotel rooms etc. on the upper levels. Although these plans would have to wait, the Council actually spent considerable funds on renovating the City Library.\n\nDemolition was still the favoured option by many in the Council. Even as late as 1969 the Labour Party candidate running for mayor in the City Council elections stated that, if elected he would propose demolition of the QVB, which he said was \"a firetrap to make way for a new civic square\". The debate extended from whether or not the building should be demolished to what uses it could be made to serve if preserved and a campaign to preserve it ensued, supported by \"public meetings, letters to editors, the National Trust and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW) as well as a group called the \"Friends of the Queen Victoria Building\". On 31 May 1971, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman Emmet McDermott, leader of the Civic Reform Group, announced the building would be \"preserved and restored to its original state\". In 1974, it was classified by the National Trust, which gave it an \"A\" classification and defined it as \"urgently in need of acquisition and preservation\". There was no suggestion of how that was going to take place, but such a statement became very much the turning point in the buildings history and eventual fate. The building was to be saved, but there was no plan or suggestions about where the funds were to come from. In 1979 the Town Clerk, Leon Carter stated; \"The Council is determined that the high cost of rebirth of the QVB will not fall on the blistered shoulders of the weary ratepayer\". Restoration proposals were held up by a combination of lack of funds and continuing disagreements between Council, potential operators and stakeholders such as the National Trust and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.\n\nIn February 1978, the Hilton Bombing damaged the glass in QVB which led to its replacement in 1979. Finally in 1979 a team was established between Architects Stephenson & Turner and Rice Daubney, Engineers Meinhardt and Partners, Kuttner Collins & Partners for administration, with financial backing by IPOH Garden Berhad. Key conservation groups backed the plan. Negotiations about plans and leases continued for almost three years, but eventually on 1 August 1983 the Lord Mayor and IPOH Garden, signed a ninety-nine year profit-sharing lease.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building was restored between 1984 and 1986 by the Malaysian Company, Ipoh Ltd (now owned by the Government Investment Corporation of Singapore), at a cost of $86 million, under the terms of a 99-year lease from the City Council and now contains mostly upmarket boutiques and \"brand-name\" shops. During the restoration a car park station was built under York Street. The building's restoration retained its exemplary features including the trachyte stairs, tessellated tiled surfaces and column capitals and created a commercial establishment that houses high end fashion stores, cafés, and restaurants which reflect the original purpose of the building in the city of Sydney. \n\"\"If there is a lesson for heritage projects from this, it is that heritage buildings should not only be restored but should be put to a use that will make them freely accessible to the community at all times ...\"\"Yap Lim Sen (Chairman, Ipoh Ltd Australia)\nThe building reopened at the end of 1986 in time to catch the busy Christmas trading season. The work took almost four years to complete and included a new underground carpark, linking tunnels and a restored interior. As almost nothing of the original interior fabric was left intact the work largely involved reconstructing the details and atmosphere of the place. The completed project can be considered a sound commercial scheme, but not a true reconstruction. A museum approach to conserving the building was recognised by all authorities as being unworkable as the building would be empty and devoid of the life the restoration brief considered essential.\n\nBy 2006, after successfully trading for twenty years, comprehensive plans were being prepared to conserve the exterior and refurbish the interior of the building to ensure the place was commercially viable as an ongoing retail complex. The major upgrade of the building's interiors were designed by the architectural firm Ancher Mortlock and Woolley in association with interior design firm Freeman Rembel and included installation of:\n\n\nBetween 2008 and 2009, Ipoh performed a $48 million refurbishment adding new colour schemes and shopfronts, glass signage, glazed balustrades and escalators connecting ground, first and second levels. This renovation was described by one architecture critic as an example of Sydney's tendency to \"start with something wonderful then, with enormous care and expense, wreck it.\" The recent conservation and refurbishment approach has aimed to clarify the legibility between historic fabric and the new fabric which must be continually updated to ensure the building is viable as an ongoing commercial complex. After its successful refurbishment, the QVB was officially reopened by the Lord Mayor of Sydney Clover Moore on 25 August 2009.\n\nA landmark grand Victorian retail arcade of three storeys, with sandstone clad walls and copper domes, designed in the Federation Romanesque style, dating from 1893–1898. Apart from the ground floor the facade is basically unaltered, being composite Romanesque and Byzantine style on a grand scale to a large city block. Constructed of brickwork and concrete with steel roof structure and the exterior faced in Sydney freestone. The dominant feature is the great central dome of in diameter and from ground to top of cupola and is sheeted externally in copper, as are the 20 smaller domes. The building consists of basement, ground and two main upper floors with additional levels in the end pavilions.\n\nThe building consists of four main shopping floors. The top three levels have large openings (protected by decorative cast-iron railings) that allow natural light from the ceiling to illuminate the lower floors. Much of the tilework, especially under the central dome, is original, and the remainder is in keeping with the original style. Underground arcades lead south to Town Hall railway station and north to the Myer building.\n\nThe upper level is especially spacious at the northern and southern ends of the building. The northern end was previously the Grand Ballroom, and is today a tea room.\n\nTwo mechanical clocks, each one featuring dioramas and moving figures from moments in history, can be seen from the adjacent railed walkways. The Royal Clock activates on the hour and displays six scenes of English royalty accompanied by Jeremiah Clarke's trumpet voluntary. The Great Australian Clock, designed and made by Chris Cook, weighs and stands tall. It includes 33 scenes from Australian history, seen from both Aboriginal and European perspectives. An Aboriginal hunter circles the exterior of the clock continuously, representing the never-ending passage of time.\n\nThe building also contains many memorials and historic displays. Of these, two large glass cases, removed in 2009–10, stood out. The first display case contained an Imperial Chinese Bridal Carriage made entirely of jade and weighing over two tonnes, the only example found outside China. The second was a life-sized figure of Queen Victoria in a replica of her Coronation regalia, and surrounded by replicas of the British Crown Jewels. Her enthroned figure rotated slowly throughout the day, fixing the onlooker with a serene and youthful gaze. On the top level near the dome is displayed a sealed letter to be opened in 2085 by the future Lord Mayor of Sydney and read aloud to the People of Sydney. It was written by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 and no one else knows what it contains.\n\nTwo allegorical groups of marble figures above the entrances on York Street and George Street (the two long sides of the building) were designed by William Priestly MacIntosh and selected by a committee made up of the Mayor (Alderman Ives), the Government Architect (Walter Liberty Vernon) and the city Architect (McRae) from designs submitted and displayed in the Sydney Town Hall, among which was one submitted by Australia's first locally-born woman sculptor, Theodora Cowan. MacIntosh's two winning allegorical groups consisted of one centring on a figure of the \"Genius of the City\" and the other on the \"Genius of Civilisation\", who was said to be modelled on Australian swimmer Percy Cavill. They were described thus:\n\nThe statuary for the second group was approved in February 1898. Mr McRae was \"well satisfied\" with the decision, although he would have preferred them to have been made in bronze.\n\nAt the southern end of the building is the Bicentennial Plaza, facing the Sydney Town Hall across Druitt Street. Another statue of Queen Victoria, arrayed on a light grey stone plinth, is the work of Irish sculptor John Hughes. This statue stood outside the legislative assembly of the Republic of Ireland—Dáil Éireann in Leinster House, Dublin—until 1947, when it was put into storage. It was later given to the people of Sydney by the Government of the Republic of Ireland and placed on its present site in 1987.\n\nNearby stands a wishing well featuring a bronze sculpture of Queen Victoria's favourite dog \"Islay\", which was sculpted by local Sydney artist Justin Robson. A recorded message voiced by John Laws urges onlookers to give a donation and make a wish. The money cast into this well goes to the benefit of deaf and blind children.\n\nAs at 16 February 2004, the exterior facades above the awning line are largely intact but heavily conserved. For example, the drum of the dome is of rendered concrete painted to resemble stone and the small cupolas adorning the parapet are of fibre glass construction painted to resemble copper. Below the awnings, shopfronts have been interpretively reconstructed. Externally, the building is in good condition.\n\nInternally some historic fabric remains. However, due to wide scale destruction in the past the interiors, which were constructed between 1982 and 1986, are largely an interpretive reconstruction as opposed to an accurate reconstruction. While some original features and fabric remains, the 1986 \"restoration\" approach intended to recreate the imagery of a grand Victorian style arcade with considerable concessions made to ensure the place was commercially viable as a retail shopping centre.\n\nThe interior has been modified with the installation of contemporary shopfronts, new interior signage, a new contemporary internal colour scheme, new internal lighting, BCA compliant glass and metal balustrades, new floor finishes, reconstruction of ground floor steel entrance gates and selective bathroom upgrades. The recent conservation and refurbishment approach has aimed to clarify the legibility between historic fabric and new fabric. A new vertical escalator system in both the north and south galleries has also been installed. Internally, the building is in good condition.\n\n\nAs at 6 October 2009, The Queen Victoria Building is an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings from the Victorian-Federation era in Australia, which has no known equal in Australia in its architectural style, scale, level of detailing and craftsmanship. Saved from demolition in the 1980s, and restored to its original glory, the Queen Victoria Building is an iconic heritage building of Sydney and Australia.\n\nDating from 1898, the Queen Victoria Building represents Australia's largest and grandest Victorian arcade, as well as the largest, most monumental and most intact of the market buildings of Sydney City. The site of the Queen Victoria Building has continued to operate as a market facility for over 190 years, which is a significant historical continuum.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building is a superb example of the Federation Romanesque style, also known as the American Romanesque style and a continuation of the Victorian Romanesque style. It represents possibly the largest and finest example of the American Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, demonstrating the influence of the prominent 19th-century American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in Australia during this period. The building expresses an ambitious use of building technology, excellent craftsmanship and decorative detailing. Both the building exteriors and interiors are remarkable and outstanding for their quality, workmanship, materials, richness, imagery and style. The Queen Victoria Building also represents an important building in the professional work of the prominent city architect, George McRae (later, the NSW Government architect) and has an outstanding ability to reflect through its aesthetics and scale, the planning strategies of the city architect for Sydney during the late 19th century.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building represents an important shift in heritage consciousness in Sydney during the 1980s because of the public outcry that brought about its conservation and, in particular, the historical restoration approach taken for its refurbishment. It also reflects, through its building development concessions, the importance of heritage conservation in more recent government strategies. At the time of its restoration by the 1980s, few original internal features remained such as some column capitals, trachyte stairs and some tessellated tiles surfaces. The present interiors of the building demonstrate an interpretive reconstruction from the 1980s intended to recreate the imagery of a grand Victorian style arcade with considerable concessions made to ensure the place was commercially viable as an ongoing retail shopping centre.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building is a major landmark of Sydney, occupying a full city block, allowing it to be viewed in the round, and forming a major pedestrian link of Sydney City, both at ground level and underground. It makes a significant contribution to the streetscape of the four main streets of the City centre that encircle the building. The building also forms one of the precinct of three key Victorian buildings exemplifying ecclesiastical, government and commercial architecture in Sydney, together with St Andrew's Cathedral and Sydney Town Hall. The Queen Victoria Building and these Victorian buildings have a strong presence as the centre of Sydney City.\n\nQueen Victoria Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building is an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings from the Victorian-Federation era in Australia. Constructed in 1893-8 as a grand gesture of Civic pride and Victorian confidence, the Queen Victoria Building is the largest, most monumental and most intact of the Sydney City market buildings, and represents the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia. At the time of its construction, the main dome with a span of was the largest dome in the southern hemisphere. The site of the Queen Victoria Building has continued to operate as a market facility for over 190 years, which is a significant historical continuum.\n\nIt is an important building in the professional work of the city architect, George McRae, which in association with the Manning Building and City Corporation Building, demonstrates the varied repertoire of the McRae period. This building has outstanding ability to reflect through its aesthetics, the scale of the planning strategies of the city architect during the late 19th century. It is significant as the site of the city library from 1933 to 1987, and of a range of many other uses, including council offices.\n\nSaved from demolition in the 1980s and restored to its original glory, the Queen Victoria Building is an iconic heritage building of Sydney and Australia. It is a significant adaptive reuse project for the 1980s, representing an important shift in heritage consciousness of the 1980s towards an \"historicist\" approach to refurbishment and an early example of a \"conservation\" project without the preparation of a conservation plan. The successful adaptive reuse of the Queen Victoria Building in the 1980s was of major importance to the development of the conservation movement in the city, which resulted in the retention of many important public and private buildings in the city.\n\nThe site of the QVB also forms part of the elevated areas surrounding and including Hyde Park which was originally a large ceremonial site for Aboriginal people.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building site is associated with Governor Macquarie, who dedicated the site for use as a market in 1810. It is also associated with George McRae, the prominent City Architect during the late 19th century, who later became NSW Government Architect from 1912 to 1923. The building has associations with many original early tenants of the market building, including Quong Tart, the prominent 19th-century businessman and philanthropist, and household names such as Lindemans, Penfolds, Singer, and the Young Women's Christian Association.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building is a superb example of the American Romanesque style in Australia, which expresses an ambitious use of building technology, excellent craftsmanship and decorative detailing, internally and externally. The building is possibly the largest and finest example of the Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, demonstrating the influence of the American Architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in Australia during this period.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building is a major landmark of Sydney, occupying a full city block, allowing it to be viewed in the round. It forms an important component of the three major Victorian buildings grouped in the centre of Sydney City including St Andrews Cathedral and Sydney Town Hall.\n\nThe building is a rare and outstanding example of a grand scale composition for a market building with a highly intact but extensively restored original exterior and reconstructed interior. The design is well resolved both internally and externally, and the building is particularly noted for its use of stone on the facade and colonnade.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe community value for the building is evidenced by the major public outcry in response to its proposed demolition during the 1980s, which played a major role in its conservation at that time. The Queen Victoria Building holds a special place in the community as a major city landmark for its appearance, function, imagery, quality, grand interior spaces, and as a major meeting place and pedestrian link through the City. It is a much loved and well used building. It is significant for its ability to reflect, through its building concessions, the importance of heritage to the government and community at large.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nIt is significant as an early and innovative use of concrete technology. The construction was also innovative as the main dome with a span of was the largest dome in the southern hemisphere at the time and has further significance for its steel construction. The surviving examples of original WC cubicles and urinals represent significant relics and are unique.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe building is rare in Australia as possibly the largest and finest example of the Romanesque style to be constructed in Australia, and as the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia. Although a number of buildings in Australia exhibit similar characteristics as the Queen Victoria Building, such as the Strand Arcade (built 1890), the Royal Arcade of Melbourne (built 1869), the Freemantle Markets of Western Australia (built 1898), and the Federation Romanesque building of the Societe Generale House of Sydney (built 1894), the Queen Victoria Building is unique in Australia and has no real comparison in the nation as an example of the Federation Romanesque Style, as a market building, or as a retail arcade, in terms of its scale, level of detailing and materiality. It was rare for such a large public building in Australia to be designed and constructed in the Romanesque style, with the smooth faced stonework being an unusual interpretation for the style.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building represents an outstanding example of the grand retail buildings of the Victorian-Federation era in Australia, which has no known equal in Australia in its architectural style, scale, level of detailing and materiality.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building represents the largest and grandest Victorian arcade in Australia, and the largest, most monumental and most intact of the market buildings of Sydney City.\n\nThe Queen Victoria Building represents a superb example of the Federation Romanesque style, also known as the American Romanesque style and a continuation of the Victorian Romanesque style.

{"id": "2083796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083796", "title": "Recorder (judge)", "text": "Recorder (judge)\n\nA recorder is a judicial officer in England and Wales and some other common law jurisdictions.\n\nIn the courts of England and Wales the term \"recorder\" has two distinct meanings. The senior circuit judge of a borough or city is often awarded the title of \"Honorary Recorder\". However, \"Recorder\" is also used to denote a person who sits as a part-time circuit judge.\nIn England and Wales, originally a recorder was a certain magistrate or judge having criminal and civil jurisdiction within the corporation of a city or borough. Such incorporated bodies were given the right by the Crown to appoint a recorder. He was a person with legal knowledge appointed by the mayor and aldermen of the corporation to 'record' the proceedings of their courts and the customs of the borough or city. Such recordings were regarded as the highest evidence of fact. Typically, the appointment would be given to a senior and distinguished practitioner at the Bar, and it was, therefore, usually executed part-time only, by a person whose usual practice was as a barrister. It carried a great deal of prestige and power of patronage. The recorder of a borough was often entrusted by the mayor and corporation to nominate its Members of Parliament, as was the case with the Recorder of Barnstaple, who in 1545 nominated the two MPs to represent the Borough of Barnstaple. The only survival today of the historic office is the Recorder of London who is still appointed by the Court of Aldermen of the Corporation of the City of London and thereby becomes a member of that court. He is a senior circuit judge sitting at the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey).\n\nThe ancient recorderships of England and Wales now form part of a system of honorary recorderships which are filled by the most senior full-time circuit judges. At each Crown Court centre, a particular judge is appointed \"resident judge\", leads the team of judges who sit there and provides the essential link between the judiciary and the administration. In the larger city court centres, the resident judge is usually a senior circuit judge who is recruited and appointed specifically to that post. An exception is the Corporation of the City of London which still follows ancient custom as stated above.\n\nIn the many smaller towns and cities where the resident judge is not a senior circuit judge, the position is different. The resident judge is deployed specifically to that post by the Lord Chief Justice (with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor) from the ranks of the circuit bench. They then hold office as resident judge for a set period, normally four years, although such appointments are renewable.\nWhilst the appointment of an honorary recorder has lain with the borough council since the Courts Act 1971, in practice the resident judge is appointed as the honorary recorder. In a borough that is coincident with an ancient assize the position is titular; that is, the resident judge is automatically entitled honorary recorder and continues to hold that title until their retirement from the post.\n\nIn the case where the resident judge is a fixed-term appointment, it is expected that the city or borough council will appoint them as honorary recorder for the duration of their tenure as resident judge. Boroughs which had a power by charter to appoint a recorder before 1971, but which had no quarter sessions, have a preserved right to appoint anyone, including non-lawyers, as honorary recorder, but an honorary recorder who is not a judge cannot sit as a judge in court or exercise any judicial functions. The procedure to be followed is that laid down by the Lord Chief Justice in his \"\"Guidelines for the Appointment of Honorary Recorders\"\", which states that it has been the practice of most large city councils to appoint the resident judge to be honorary recorder of the city during his tenure of the office. Some new positions have been created since 1971, for example for the Borough of Redbridge.\n\nThe appointment of an honorary recorder is made by the borough council concerned, and although it does not require the approval of a higher authority, the Lord Chief Justice has let it be known that he would be pleased if boroughs considering making such an appointment would first consult the Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales.\n\nDue to the reorganisation of courts, especially where local government reorganisation has occurred at the same time, some titles bestowed by one council may be held by the senior resident judge sitting in another borough; a prominent example is the Recorder of the City of Westminster who presides at the Crown Court situated in the London Borough of Southwark.\n\nThe protocol of the use of the title is that it is customary for an honorary recorder, when sitting in the Crown Court in the city or town where he holds that office, to be described as such in the published court lists. This should not be done, however, when the judge is sitting in the Crown Court in another city or town, whether or not that city or town has an honorary recorder of its own.\nHonorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are authorised by the Lord Chief Justice to wear red robes when sitting in court. These robes are based on the design of the robes worn by judges of the County Court, but in red and black. They were designed for the recorders of Manchester and Liverpool in 1956. The right to wear them in court was extended in the 1980s to the other senior circuit judges appointed as honorary recorders, but has not been extended to those who are not senior circuit judges. Accordingly, when sitting in court, honorary recorders who are not senior circuit judges continue to wear the normal robes of a circuit judge sitting in the Crown Court. In addition, honorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are addressed in court as \"My Lord/Lady\" (as for a High Court Judge) instead of \"Your Honour\" (as for other circuit judges, including senior circuit judges who are not honorary recorders). In the law reports and in court lists an honorary recorder is usually styled \"The Recorder of X\".\n\nSince 1971 the term \"recorder\" has also been used for a part-time judicial appointment in England and Wales, providing part-time experience of judicial office. The part-time appointees were initially designated \"Assistant Recorder\", with a view to promotion to full \"recorder\". Appointments are no longer made to the position of Assistant Recorder.\n\nAppointments are made by the Crown by Royal Warrant, on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Since 2006 the Lord Chancellor's recommendations are based upon an independent appointments process by the Judicial Appointments Commission.\n\nEligibility is restricted to barristers or solicitors of at least seven years' standing. A recorder, when acting as such, has all the powers of a circuit judge and may sit in the Crown Court or in the County Court. A recorder sitting in the Crown Court or County Court is addressed as \"Your Honour\" (save in the Central Criminal Court (or Old Bailey) where all judges are addressed as \"My Lord (or Lady)\"). If appointed to do so under section 9(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, a recorder may sit as a part-time High Court judge.\n\nA recorder is paid a daily fee and is expected to sit as a judge for between three and six weeks a year.\n\nThe Recorder of Dublin was the principal magistrate for the city of Dublin until the office was abolished in 1924. The judicial offices of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Derry still exist. There were also prior to 1924 a Recorder of Cork and Recorders of Limerick, Youghal, Galway, Enniskillen, Carrickfergus, Kinsale, Dundalk, Waterford, Hillsborough, Cashel and Clonmel.\n\nHong Kong operates a system of appointing part-time recorders similar to that in England & Wales. The recordership scheme was introduced in Hong Kong in 1994 to encourage experienced practitioners who are willing to sit as a High Court Judge for a few weeks every year, but are not prepared to commit themselves to a permanent, full-time appointment. It was intended to act as a more formal system of appointment compared to the more ad hoc nature of appointment of Deputy High Court Judges.\n\nRecorders are practitioners in private practice (in practice, Senior Counsel) who are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission (JORC). The appointment is for a fixed term of a few years, during which the practitioner sits as a recorder hearing cases in the Court of First Instance of the High Court for a few weeks in a year. Recorders may exercise all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a full-time Judge of the Court of First Instance.\n\nThe qualification for appointment as a recorder is the same as that for High Court Judge: that is, having practised for at least 10 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction.\n\nAs of 1 April 2020, Recorders receive honoraria at a daily rate of HK$11,765.\n\nIn some U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, the Recorder's Court is a local court of limited jurisdiction, most often hearing misdemeanors, traffic violations, and other petty criminal offenses. The Recorder of New York City was one of the judges of the Court of General Sessions (the local court of general jurisdiction on criminal cases) and presided over most murder trials in New York City. Historically, the City of Detroit, Michigan had a Recorder's Court, which has now been subsumed as 36th District Court and part of Wayne County Circuit Court.\n\nIn the biblical kingdom of Israel, the recorder was the chancellor or vizier of the kingdom.

Acting alongside Heath Ledger (who died before filming had finished), Cole, in an interview for the \"Daily Telegraph\" admitted that, at times, she felt out of her depth in the role — saying \"I'd only done a couple of films and here I was surrounded by amazing actors like Christopher Plummer and Heath Ledger, and it was intimidating at times,\" also describing the role as \"the biggest role I've ever done\".\n\nGilliam said of Cole: \"She has an amazing look and grasps what is required so very quickly. If she wants a career as an actress, she has a brilliant future\".

He became a victim of the Melbourne gangland killings, which were dramatised in the drama series \"Underbelly\".\n\nKinniburgh's criminal record consisted of charges of wounding with intent to cause murder, escaping legal custody, dishonesty, racketeering, extortion, bribery, possession of firearms, escape, resisting arrest and assaulting police. Kinniburgh met with members of the Moran family while working on Melbourne's waterside. A former member of the notorious Painters and Dockers, Kinniburgh was considered Melbourne's \"Mr Big\" and one of the most influential gangsters in Australia.\n\nKinniburgh garnered notoriety for his role in the Melbourne gangland killings. On 13 December 2003, Kinniburgh himself was murdered outside his home in Kew on Belmont Avenue. Two members of a rival criminal gang, or a two-man operation, was suspected of involvement in his death; Carl Williams was questioned, and Andrew Veniamin was treated as a suspect. In 2004, Mick Gatto claimed that Veniamin had implicated himself in Kinniburgh's death prior to himself being killed, but it was later shown that Veniamin had been on the other side of town at the time of the murder. This was deduced by tracking his mobile phone at the time of the murder. However, this in turn has been disputed as a case of the mobile phone and not Veniamin having an alibi. If Veniamin had been one of the two gunmen who killed Kinniburgh, then the identity of the other has never been established.\n\nIn November 2015, police charged Stephen John Asling with Kinniburgh's murder, who has, subsequently, been committed to trial for the offence. On Saturday, 18 March 2017, Asling was found guilty of Kinniburgh's murder.\n\nKinniburgh was a long-term associate of Alphonse Gangitano. On 16 January 1998, Kinniburgh had been drinking with associate, Lou Cozzo, at the Laurel Hotel in Ascot Vale before driving to the home of Alphonse Gangitano.\n\nKinniburgh left the house shortly after 11 pm to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Upon his return 30 minutes later, Kinniburgh found Gangitano had been shot several times to the head. Gangitano's de facto wife, Virginia, was with the body of her husband who had died in the laundry. Kinniburgh adopted a code of silence, frustrating police investigating the murder. Evidence was presented at an inquest that showed both Kinniburgh and Jason Moran were at the home of Gangitano on the night of his murder. Both were exempted from giving evidence at the inquest on the grounds their evidence may incriminate them. Kinniburgh's blood was discovered at the murder scene and a witness had seen Moran leaving Gangitano's house. \n\nIn the drama series \"Underbelly\" he is portrayed by actor Gerard Kennedy and also reprises his role in the 2014 direct sequel \"Fat Tony & Co.\".\n\n\n"}

Notable for his involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings, Moran was shot dead in The Brunswick Club Hotel in Melbourne on 31 March 2004. His murder occurred one week after the funeral of fellow Melbourne underworld criminal and suspected hitman Andrew Veniamin.\n\nMoran, married to Judy Moran, was the father of murdered Melbourne underworld figure Jason Moran, murdered in 2003, and stepfather of Mark Moran, murdered in 2000. Moran was a long-term associate of Graham Kinniburgh after meeting as workers on Melbourne's waterside. Kinniburgh was earlier executed outside his Kew home on 13 December 2003. He was also the brother of underworld figure Desmond \"Tuppence\" Moran, who was shot dead on 15 June 2009, just outside a cafe on Union Road in Ascot Vale.\n\nOn 31 March 2004, Lewis Moran and Herbert \"Bertie\" Wrout were at The Brunswick Club Hotel, on Sydney Road, Brunswick, which was their regular drinking place. Both men were on bail and did not carry firearms, which would have been a breach of their bail conditions. Moran was on bail facing serious drug trafficking charges. Two gunmen wearing balaclavas entered the Brunswick Club, at approximately 6:40 p.m. on that day, driving a Ford Falcon EF XR6 station wagon. Moran ran from his place at the bar, over a poker machine, through a glass window before the gunman caught up with him and shot him twice, the fatal bullet being fired into the back of his head from a few centimetres away. Wrout was severely wounded but survived the attack.\n\nKeith Faure, his brother Noel Faure and associate Evangelos Goussis were charged on 13 May 2005 with the murder and shooting. Initially they all pleaded not guilty. On 3 May 2006, Keith Faure pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 19 years for the murders of Moran and Lewis Caine, who was killed two months after Moran. Noel Faure, who was described as a \"gun for hire\", was convicted of the murder of Moran and of shooting Herbert Wrout and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 23 years. Former Kickboxing champ Goussis, 40, of Geelong was found guilty of Moran's murder on 29 May 2008 in the Victorian Supreme Court. Goussis had stormed into the Brunswick Club and shot Moran as he cowered in a corner. Goussis and two others reportedly accepted a $150,000 contract from Tony Mokbel to kill Moran, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. After five days deliberation, the jury also found Goussis guilty of intentionally causing serious injury to Wrout, but not guilty of his attempted murder. Goussis was also convicted of murdering Caine. In February 2009, Goussis was sentenced to a minimum 30 years in prison for Moran's murder. Lewis Moran was suspected in ordering the death of underworld Hitman Dino Dibra.\n\nOn 7 May 2007, Carl Williams was convicted of commissioning the murders of four gangland rivals including Jason Moran, Lewis Moran, Mark Mallia and Michael Marshall and for conspiracy to murder a fourth, and sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 35 years. Williams died in Barwon prison, on 19 April 2010, as the result of an attack by a fellow inmate.\n\nNoel Faure, who was convicted of the murder of Moran for a fee of A$150,000 and of shooting Herbert Wrout, and was serving a life sentence, died in prison on 8 March 2017, aged 62 after suffering a long illness.\n\nIn the local Australian TV drama series \"Underbelly\" Lewis Moran is played by actor Kevin Harrington. Moran is also portrayed in the Australian TV drama series \"Killing Time\" by actor Colin Friels.\n\n'Lewis in the U' for solo bass, choir and instrumental ensemble depicts the death of Lewis Moran.

{"id": "2083812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083812", "title": "Lady Marjorie Bellamy", "text": "Lady Marjorie Bellamy\n\nThe Lady Marjorie Helen Sybil Bellamy (\"nee\" Talbot-Carey; 6 May 1860 or 12 July 1864 – 15 April 1912) was a fictional character in the ITV drama \"Upstairs, Downstairs\". She was portrayed by Rachel Gurney.\n\nLady Marjorie was born on 6 May 1860, or according to another episode 12 July 1864, at Southwold, Wiltshire in the home of her wealthy parents, Walter Talbot-Carey, 12th Earl of Southwold and Mabel, the Countess of Southwold. The Earl was a major influence in the Conservative Party. She had one brother, Hugo, Viscount Ashby, who later became 13th Earl of Southwold. As well as this, she had a paternal aunt and uncle and cousin, who succeeded Hugo as Earl of Southwold.\n\nDespite parental objections, she ended up marrying the younger son of a country parson, Richard Bellamy in 1880 and they lived rent free in a grand Victorian townhouse which Lady Marjorie's father the Earl of Southwold owned the lease, 165, Eaton Place in London's fashionable Belgravia. They had two children, James (born 1881) and Elizabeth (born 1887). Shortly before their marriage, Richard had become a Conservative MP with the help of her father.\n\nLady Marjorie was portrayed as elegant and having something of the hauteur of women of her age and class but also as basically kind. She maintained social and class distinctions at all times and, unlike her upright husband, is less concerned about absolute moral values than appearances.\n\nIn the summer of 1906, she had an affair with a much younger man, Charles Victor Hammond, a Captain in the Khyber Rifles and a friend of her son. After the affair had been going on for some time (presumed secret but never was), he asked her to run off with him but she refused as she realised her duty to her family. Her lover was later, by then a Major, killed during a battle in India in 1909. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. In a later episode, a man (Mr.Dooley) who had been Hammond's military batman (personal attendant) showed up with a packet of love letters she had written to him. Rebuffed at the front door of 165 Eaton Place by Mr. Hudson (the butler) as an \"unwashed Irish vagrant\", he went around to the mews to make himself agreeable to Thomas the chauffeur. In a sting attempt by the chauffeur, who was given the letters for the purpose of negotiating with Lady Marjorie, monies were extorted from both Bellamys, each unknown to the other, with the convoluted result that ended with Mr. Dooley in jail (on an unrelated charge) and all monies restored to the individuals—with Thomas receiving a gratuity from each of the Bellamys. \nShe was always having trouble with her two children. Elizabeth was a wild child and flirted with socialism, and she married in 1908 a man who failed to consummate their marriage (the story line all but confirms his homosexuality though Lawrence had no problem sleeping with Evelyn Larkin, Elizabeth's bohemian/radical friend), and she had an affair with his publisher at the behest of her husband. As a result, Elizabeth became pregnant and delivered a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth, her marriage was ended, and her husband dispatched to the continent \"with a modest pension\" from the Bellamys \"to keep him happy\" (and quiet) about the sordid affair. \nIn 1908, James, who was always her favourite, had an affair with the housemaid Sarah and she ended up expecting. James was sent to India. Sarah was shipped off to Southwold, but returned to Eaton Place in May 1909 on her own and unhappy, saying \"No one said anything to me one day to the next!\" Sarah was in labour while the King was dining upstairs, and the baby boy was still-born.\n\nOn 15 April 1912 Lady Marjorie and her lady's maid, Miss Roberts, along with Lady Marjorie's brother the new Lord Southwold and his new wife (a widow, Marion Worsely, mother of Georgina by her previous marriage) were passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\". They were both presumed dead, but Roberts survived and later informed the family that Lady Marjorie had at first refused to go out on deck as it was too cold. When ordered to by the ship's crew, Lady Marjorie and Roberts found on deck a little girl crying she had lost her mother. Lady Marjorie pressed her jewel case into Roberts' hands, her last words being \"Keep this safe for me, Roberts.\"; she then took the little girl's hand, saying she would help her find her mother. This was the last time Roberts saw her Ladyship. Roberts was forcibly placed into a lifeboat before Lady Marjorie returned, and even though there was hardly anyone aboard the lifeboat the crew refused to return to the ship for fear of being sucked down as the Titanic sank. The next day Roberts was rescued along with the other survivors, but was in a state of shock so no one knew her identity, with the result that both were listed as dead. Later when she returned to her senses in a New York City hospital she realised who she was and subsequently made her way back to London.\n\nThe episode \"A Family Gathering\" has the Bellamys celebrating Lady Marjorie's birthday on the same day as The King died, 6 May. In the episode \"Desirous of Change\", her birthday is, however, said to be 12 July. However the 12 July date is from a book and most likely a typical error common in most books about families. Since the Bellamys celebrate the 6 May onscreen it is more likely to be her birthday.\n\nJames in novelisations is said to be 23 in 1904 at his entrance in \"Board Wages\". In 1912 when he first met Hazel, Lady Prudence remarks to Richard that James is 30 now and that his other friends are married. Actually in 1912 James would have been 31 but he may have not had a birthday yet or Lady Prudence felt herself accurate enough to round off his age to 30. However, as a lifelong friend of Lady Marjorie she should have known James' exact age.\n\nElizabeth's birth of 1887 is more consistent in the series. She comes back from schooling in Germany as a 17-year-old in 1905 (she possibly has a late year birthday). Later when Elizabeth becomes involved with Julius Karekin, Richard is heard to say that \"...Elizabeth is 23 now!\" which would have been late 1909 or early 1910. Once again Richard should have known the exact age of his own daughter.\n"}

During his tenure with that magazine, he became a leading figure within the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa). During the 1970s he headed the United Nations Observer Mission of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in New York City and used this position to popularize the PAC particularly among African-Americans. In 1979 Sibeko was partially successful in a leadership coup against Potlako Leballo. However he failed to get support from the Second Azanian People's Liberation Army, recruited from the 1976 student protest generation and was shot dead during an argument with them at his flat in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 12 June 1979.\n\nDavid Sibeko's contribution to the liberation struggle in South Africa unfortunately is little known. In actuality his influence was pervasive and, some would argue, on par with that of Nelson Mandela. Sibeko adroitly used his position as the head of the PAC Observer Mission at the United Nations as a way to unite diverse sectors of the international black community behind the PAC. Thus he counted among his personal friends and supporters personages as varied as Andrew Young, Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture), Julius Nyerere, Louis Farrakhan, and the heads of state of countries such as Haiti (pre-Aristide), to Libya, Egypt, the future Zimbabwe, Ghana, Guinea, and many more that comprised the Organization of African Unity.\n\nA sharp thinker, and, above all, an eminently practical, big-hearted man with an easy laugh, he could be seen coaxing support from a U.S. State Department official one minute, gathering support from the communist Chinese the next, and persuading the Soviet representatives to assist the PAC in some small matter or another after that.

It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the Trojan cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the \"Aethiopis\" comes chronologically immediately after that of the Homeric \"Iliad\", and is followed by that of the \"Little Iliad\". The \"Aethiopis\" was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (8th century BC) (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised five books of verse in dactylic hexameter.\n\nThe \"Aethiopis\" was probably composed in the seventh century BC, but there is much uncertainty about its date. Ancient sources date Arctinus to the eighth century; but the earliest artistic representations of one of the most important characters, Penthesilea, date to about 600 BC, suggesting a much later date.\n\nIn current critical editions only five lines survive of the \"Aethiopis\"' original text. We are almost entirely dependent on a summary of the Cyclic epics contained in the \"Chrestomathy\" attributed to an unknown Proclus (possibly to be identified with the 2nd-century AD grammarian Eutychius Proclus). Fewer than ten other references give indications of the poem's storyline.\n\nThe poem opens shortly after the death of the Trojan hero Hector, with the arrival of the Amazon warrior Penthesileia who has come to support the Trojans. She has a moment of glory in battle, but Achilles kills her. The Greek warrior Thersites later taunts Achilles, claiming that he had been in love with her, and Achilles kills him too. Achilles is ritually purified for the murder of Thersites.\n\nNext another Trojan ally arrives, Memnon, son of Eos and Tithonus, leading an Ethiopian contingent and wearing armour made by the god Hephaestus. In battle, Memnon kills Antilochus, a Greek warrior who was the son of Nestor and a great favourite of Achilles. Achilles then kills Memnon, and Zeus makes Memnon immortal at Eos' request. But in his rage Achilles pursues the Trojans into the very gates of Troy, and at the Scaean Gates he is killed by an arrow shot by Paris, assisted by the god Apollo. Achilles' body is rescued by Ajax and Odysseus.\n\nThe Greeks hold a funeral for Antilochus. Achilles's mother, the sea nymph Thetis, comes with her sisters and the Muses to lament over Achilles's body. Funeral games are held in honour of Achilles, at which his armor and weapons are offered as a prize for the greatest hero. A dispute over them develops between Ajax and Odysseus. There the \"Aethiopis\" ends; it is uncertain whether the judgment of Achilles' armor, and subsequent suicide of Ajax, were told in the \"Aethiopis\", in the next epic in the Cycle, the \"Little Iliad\", or in both.\n\nEvents told in the story of the \"Aethiopis\" were popular among ancient Greek vase painters. Especially popular scenes are the death of Penthesilea, and Ajax's retrieval of Achilles' corpse.\n\nDespite being poorly attested, the \"Aethiopis\" is frequently cited in modern scholarship on the Homeric \"Iliad\". It is one of the most important paradigms used in Neoanalytic scholarship on Homer because of strong similarities between its story of Achilles, Antilochus, and Memnon, and the Iliadic story of Achilles, Patroclus, and Hector; the claim that such a similarity exists is known as the \"Memnon theory\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2083830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083830", "title": "Neutral particle oscillation", "text": "Neutral particle oscillation\n\nIn particle physics, neutral particle oscillation is the transmutation of a particle with zero electric charge into another neutral particle due to a change of a non-zero internal quantum number via an interaction that does not conserve that quantum number. For example, a neutron cannot transmute into an antineutron as that would violate the conservation of baryon number. But in hypothetical extensions of the Standard Model where baryon number is not strictly conserved, neutron–antineutron oscillations are predicted to occur.\n\nSuch oscillations can be classified into two types:\nIn case the particles decay to some final product, then the system is not purely oscillatory, and an interference between oscillation and decay is observed.\n\nAfter the striking evidence for parity violation provided by Wu et al. in 1957, it was assumed that CP (charge conjugation-parity) is the quantity which is conserved. However, in 1964 Cronin and Fitch reported CP violation in the neutral Kaon system. They observed the long-lived K (CP = −1) undergoing two pion decays (CP = (−1)(−1) = +1), thereby violating CP conservation.\n\nIn 2001, CP violation in the – system was confirmed by the BaBar and the Belle experiments. Direct CP violation in the – system was reported by both the labs by 2005.\n\nThe – and the – systems can be studied as two state systems considering the particle and its antiparticle as the two states.\n\nThe pp chain in the sun produces an abundance of . In 1968, Raymond Davis et al. first reported the results of the Homestake experiment. Also known as the Davis experiment, it used a huge tank of perchloroethylene in Homestake mine (it was deep underground to eliminate background from cosmic rays), South Dakota, USA. Chlorine nuclei in the perchloroethylene absorb to produce argon via the reaction\n\nBut this is physically same as formula_2 as the exponential term is just a phase factor and does not produce a new state. In other words, energy eigenstates are stationary eigenstates, i.e. they do not yield physically new states under time evolution.\n\nIn the basis formula_3, formula_4 is diagonal. That is,\n\nIt can be shown, that oscillation between states will occur if and only if off-diagonal terms of the Hamiltonian are non-zero.\n\nHence let us introduce a general perturbation formula_6 in formula_4 such that the resultant Hamiltonian formula_8 is still Hermitian. Then,\n\nand,\nThen, the eigenvalues of formula_8 are,\n\nSince formula_8 is a general Hamiltonian matrix, it can be written as,\n\nThe following two results are clear:\n\nWriting the eigenvectors of formula_4 in terms of those of formula_8 we get,\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow if the particle starts out as an eigenstate of formula_4 (say, formula_2), that is,\n\nthen under time evolution we get,\n\nwhich unlike the previous case, is distinctly different from formula_2.\n\nWe can then obtain the probability of finding the system in state formula_24 at time formula_25 as,\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich is called Rabi's formula. Hence, starting from one eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian formula_4, the state of the system oscillates between the eigenstates of formula_4 with a frequency (known as Rabi frequency),\n\n</math>\n\nFrom the expression of formula_28 we can infer that oscillation will exist only if formula_29. formula_30 is thus known as the coupling term as it couples the two eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian formula_4 and thereby facilitates oscillation between the two.\n\nOscillation will also cease if the eigenvalues of the perturbed Hamiltonian formula_8 are degenerate, i.e. formula_33. But this is a trivial case as in such a situation, the perturbation itself vanishes and formula_8 takes the form (diagonal) of formula_4 and we're back to square one.\n\nHence, the necessary conditions for oscillation are:\n\nIf the particle(s) under consideration undergoes decay, then the Hamiltonian describing the system is no longer Hermitian. Since any matrix can be written as a sum of its Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts, formula_8 can be written as,\n\nThe eigenvalues of formula_8 are,\n\nThe suffixes stand for Heavy and Light respectively (by convention) and this implies that formula_42 is positive.\n\nThe normalized eigenstates corresponding to formula_43 and formula_44 respectively, in the natural basis formula_45 are,\n\nformula_46 and formula_47 are the mixing terms. Note that the eigenstates are no longer orthogonal.\n\nLet the system start in the state formula_48. That is,\n\nUnder time evolution we then get,\n\nSimilarly, if the system starts in the state formula_51, under time evolution we obtain,\n\nIf in a system formula_48 and formula_54 represent CP conjugate states (i.e. particle-antiparticle) of one another (i.e. formula_55 and formula_56), and certain other conditions are met, then CP violation can be observed as a result of this phenomenon. Depending on the condition, CP violation can be classified into three types:\n\nConsider the processes where formula_57 decay to final states formula_58, where the barred and the unbarred kets of each set are CP conjugates of one another.\n\nThe probability of formula_48 decaying to formula_60 is given by,\n\nand that of its CP conjugate process by,\n\nIf there is no CP violation due to mixing, then formula_63.\n\nNow, the above two probabilities are unequal if,\n\nHence, the decay becomes a CP violating process as the probability of a decay and that of its CP conjugate process are not equal.\n\nThe probability (as a function of time) of observing formula_51 starting from formula_48 is given by,\n\nand that of its CP conjugate process by,\n\nThe above two probabilities are unequal if,\n\nHence, the particle-antiparticle oscillation becomes a CP violating process as the particle and its antiparticle (say, formula_48 and formula_70 respectively) are no longer equivalent eigenstates of CP.\n\nLet formula_60 be a final state (a CP eigenstate) that both formula_48 and formula_51 can decay to. Then, the decay probabilities are given by,\n\nand,\n\nFrom the above two quantities, it can be seen that even when there is no CP violation through mixing alone (i.e. formula_76) and neither is there any CP violation through decay alone (i.e. formula_77) and thus formula_78, the probabilities will still be unequal provided,\n\nThe last terms in the above expressions for probability are thus associated with interference between mixing and decay.\n\nUsually, an alternative classification of CP violation is made:\n\nDirect CP violation is defined as, formula_79. In terms of the above categories, direct CP violation occurs in CP violation through decay only.\n\nIndirect CP violation is the type of CP violation that involves mixing. In terms of the above classification, indirect CP violation occurs through mixing only, or through mixing-decay interference, or both.\n\nConsidering a strong coupling between two flavor eigenstates of neutrinos (for example, –, –, etc.) and a very weak coupling between the third (that is, the third does not affect the interaction between the other two), equation () gives the probability of a neutrino of type formula_80 transmuting into type formula_81 as,\n\nwhere, formula_83 and formula_84 are energy eigenstates.\n\nThe above can be written as,\n\nx \\right)\n</math>\n\nThus, a coupling between the energy (mass) eigenstates produces the phenomenon of oscillation between the flavor eigenstates. One important inference is that neutrinos have a finite mass, although very small. Hence, their speed is not exactly the same as that of light but slightly lower.\n\nWith three flavors of neutrinos, there are three mass splittings:\n\nBut only two of them are independent, because formula_86.\n\nFor solar neutrinos, formula_87.\n\nFor atmospheric neutrinos, formula_88.\n\nThis implies that two of the three neutrinos have very closely placed masses. Since only two of the three formula_89 are independent, and the expression for probability in equation () is not sensitive to the sign of formula_89 (as sine squared is independent of the sign of its argument), it is not possible to determine the neutrino mass spectrum uniquely from the phenomenon of flavor oscillation. That is, any two out of the three can have closely spaced masses.\n\nMoreover, since the oscillation is sensitive only to the differences (of the squares) of the masses, direct determination of neutrino mass is not possible from oscillation experiments.\n\nEquation () indicates that an appropriate length scale of the system is the oscillation wavelength formula_91. We can draw the following inferences:\n\nThe 1964 paper by Christenson et al. provided experimental evidence of CP violation in the neutral Kaon system. The so-called long-lived Kaon (CP = −1) decayed into two pions (CP = (−1)(−1) = 1), thereby violating CP conservation.\n\nformula_99 and formula_100 being the strangeness eigenstates (with eigenvalues +1 and −1 respectively), the energy eigenstates are,\n\nThese two are also CP eigenstates with eigenvalues +1 and −1 respectively. From the earlier notion of CP conservation (symmetry), the following were expected:\n\nSince the two pion decay is much faster than the three pion decay, formula_102 was referred to as the short-lived Kaon formula_105, and formula_103 as the long-lived Kaon formula_107. The 1964 experiment showed that contrary to what was expected, formula_107 could decay to two pions. This implied that the long lived Kaon cannot be purely the CP eigenstate formula_103, but must contain a small admixture of formula_102, thereby no longer being a CP eigenstate. Similarly, the short-lived Kaon was predicted to have a small admixture of formula_103. That is,\n\nwhere, formula_113 is a complex quantity and is a measure of departure from CP invariance. Experimentally, formula_114.\n\nWriting formula_102 and formula_103 in terms of formula_99 and formula_100, we obtain (keeping in mind that formula_119) the form of equation ():\n\nwhere, formula_121.\n\nSince formula_122, condition () is satisfied and there is a mixing between the strangeness eigenstates formula_99 and formula_100 giving rise to a long-lived and a short-lived state.\n\nThe and have two modes of two pion decay: or . Both of these final states are CP eigenstates of themselves. We can define the branching ratios as,\n\nExperimentally, formula_126 and formula_127. That is formula_128, implying formula_129 and formula_130, and thereby satisfying condition ().\n\nIn other words, direct CP violation is observed in the asymmetry between the two modes of decay.\n\nIf the final state (say formula_131) is a CP eigenstate (for example ), then there are two different decay amplitudes corresponding to two different decay paths:\n\nCP violation can then result from the interference of these two contributions to the decay as one mode involves only decay and the other oscillation and decay.\n\nThe above description refers to flavor (or strangeness) eigenstates and energy (or CP) eigenstates. But which of them represents the \"real\" particle? What do we really detect in a laboratory? Quoting David J. Griffiths:\n\nIf the system is a three state system (for example, three species of neutrinos ––, three species of quarks ––), then, just like in the two state system, the flavor eigenstates (say formula_133, formula_134, formula_135) are written as a linear combination of the energy (mass) eigenstates (say formula_136, formula_137, formula_138). That is,\n\nIn case of leptons (neutrinos for example) the transformation matrix is the PMNS matrix, and for quarks it is the CKM matrix.\n\nN.B. The three familiar neutrino species –– are flavor eigenstates, whereas the three familiar quarks species –– are energy eigenstates.\n\nThe off diagonal terms of the transformation matrix represent coupling, and unequal diagonal terms imply mixing between the three states.\n\nThe transformation matrix is unitary and appropriate parameterization (depending on whether it is the CKM or PMNS matrix) is done and the values of the parameters determined experimentally.\n\n"}
