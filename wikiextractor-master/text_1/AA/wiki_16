(UTDC) was a Crown corporation owned by the Government of Ontario, Canada. It was created in the 1970s as a way to enter what was then expected to be a burgeoning market in advanced light rail mass transit systems. UTDC built a respected team of engineers and project managers. It developed significant expertise in linear propulsion, steerable trucks and driverless system controls which were integrated into a transit system known as the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS). It was designed to provide service at rider levels between a traditional subway on the upper end and buses and streetcars on the lower, filling a niche aimed at suburbs that were otherwise expensive to service.\n\nUrban Transportation Development Corporation Ltd. was a holding company. During its time it held several wholly owned subsidiary companies:\nThe Services and R&D companies were merged in the mid-1980s to form Transportation Technology Ltd.\n\nThe Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) was sold into three markets: the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) for its Scarborough RT line, Detroit's Detroit People Mover, and Vancouver's SkyTrain system.\n\nFurther sales proved more difficult than had been hoped, but in the early 1980s, Hawker Siddeley Canada joined forces with UTDC in order to win a number of contracts with the TTC and Ontario's GO Transit commuter network. They formed a joint operating company at their Canadian Car and Foundry (CC&F) factories in Thunder Bay and Kingston, Ontario: Can-Car Rail built heavy-rail passenger cars, subway cars, streetcars and other vehicles. Now armed with a complete portfolio from light to heavy rail, UTDC had a number of additional successes in North America, and became a major vendor in the mass transit market. It was privatized in the 1980s, when it was purchased by Lavalin of Quebec. The UTDC factories in Kingston and Thunder Bay continue to produce rapid transit systems for use in Ontario and abroad.\n\nToronto grew extensively during the 1960s and 1970s, and like many cities in North America, most of this growth was in the suburbs. In order to move workers to and from the business and industrial areas in the city centre, an extensive series of expressways was planned, and made its way into the city's Official Plan in 1966. As work on the new highways started, a wave of public protest followed as many houses, and in some cases entire neighbourhoods, were bulldozed to make way. The work became increasingly opposed in Toronto, especially after the cause was taken up by famous urban commentator, Jane Jacobs.\n\nIn 1971 Bill Davis won the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership contest, replacing long-serving John Robarts as the official party leader and Premier of Ontario. Shortly after taking power, on 3 June Davis announced that he was cancelling provincial support for the highly controversial Spadina Expressway in Toronto, rising in the legislature and stating that \"Cities were built for people and not cars. If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\"\n\nDavis felt that the future of urban transit lay not in the automobile, but mass rapid transit systems. In keeping with this, the street portion of the Spadina Expressway was cancelled in 1971, but full funding remained for the Spadina subway line that shared the same right-of-way. However, subways were suitable only for high-density routes that could afford to pay for their expensive construction and operation. In 1980 this was estimated to be between $75 and $80 million a mile. The TTC suggested that all of the high-density routes suitable for subways were already being served.\n\nThe other vehicles in use with the TTC, buses and streetcars, would not be able to provide rapid transit unless they were given a separate right-of-way. This expense is easy to justify in the case of a subway with its large passenger capacity, but for a system like a bus the capital costs overwhelm the passenger numbers these systems could carry. What was needed was a new system that reduced the capital costs to be able to efficiently serve low-density routes in the suburbs, a system with flexible sizing somewhere between a small subway and large streetcar, an \"intermediate\" sized system.\n\nWork on an Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) had already started in 1970. Several consulting firms were asked to provide separate feasibility reports with outlines of a basic system. At the time, new urban transit systems were a field of active research across North America due to U.S. federal funding under the Urban Mass Transportation Administration's (UMTA) plans to roll out new systems in cities across the country. UMTA was convinced that urban rail systems would only be able to compete with cars if they had more car-like capabilities, and they were primarily interested in the personal rapid transit (PRT) concept of automated car-like cabs that would pick up and drop off passengers as individual units and then link up into longer trains for travel at high speed between stations. A number of companies in the U.S. were in the process of developing systems for UMTA, and many of these companies submitted a proposal for the ICTS project.\n\nIt was with the formation of the new Ministry of Transportation and Communications in May 1972 that serious development of the ICTS started. On 22 November the new policy was announced. The Davis government proposed a new rail network known as \"GO-Urban\" that would operate three routes in the Toronto area under the auspices of the recently created GO Transit, and asked for submissions for ICTS vehicles to serve the routes. Fourteen designs were studied, but whittled down to eight formal proposals. Some were PRT systems, while others were more traditional subway-like systems. Three of the eight ran on rubber wheels, four were air cushion vehicles (hovercrafts) including a version of the French Aérotrain, while the German firm Krauss-Maffei entered its Transurban system, a smaller version of its Transrapid magnetically levitated train (maglev).\n\nThe space age maglev system immediately won the interest of the Davis government, and in the Phase II proposals they selected it for further study, along with the Ford ACT and Hawker Siddeley's entry, both of which used rubber tires. Ford withdrew when the ICTS varied too greatly from the system it wanted to develop, which was aimed primarily at sites in the U.S. With only Hawker Siddeley and Krauss-Maffei remaining, the 1 May 1973 announcement that the Krauss-Maffei design had won the contest was unsurprising.\n\nIn November 1974 Krauss-Maffei announced that it was forced to withdraw from the project. The West German government had been funding development of several maglev systems based on different technologies, and decided at that time that Krauss-Maffei's system was less interesting than ones from Thyssen-Henschel and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm. There were also technical problems; in testing, the complex systems needed to switch trains on the magnetic tracks froze up, and would require a re-design. With Krauss-Maffei's financial support gone, and daunting technical problems remaining to be solved, the maglev project died. A test track being constructed on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition was abandoned in place, with the foundations and a few support pillars already constructed. Krauss-Maffei continued development of the original inter-city Transrapid, but at a very slow pace and through a series of mergers with other companies involved in maglev technology. The first Transrapid system did not enter service until 30 years later.\n\nOn 14 April 1975 the Ministry of Transportation arranged financing for Phase I and II studies to develop a new system to replace the maglev. In June 1975 the Ontario Transportation Development Corporation (OTDC) announced that it had arranged a consortium to continue the development of the ICTS, changing its name to \"Urban Transportation Development Corporation\" to avoid any \"provinciality\" during its efforts to market what would now be an entirely local design to other cities. The consortium consisted of SPAR Aerospace for the linear induction motor, Standard Elektrik Lorenz's \"SelTrac IS\" system for the automatic control system, Dofasco for an articulated bogie system, Alcan for the design of the car bodies and a set of prototypes, and Canadair for assembly and production.\n\nA Transit Development Centre for UTDC was built on a site in Millhaven, outside of Kingston, Ontario. Kingston had been home to the Canadian Locomotive Company that closed its doors in 1969, and the city lobbied hard for the new company to locate there. It was officially opened on 29 September 1978 by James Snow, the Minister of Transportation and Communications. The site included a oval test track that included at-grade, elevated and ramped sections, switches, and the automatic control centre. Phase III of the ICTS program ended on 31 January 1980 when testing on the prototype was completed at the Millhaven site; by this point the government had invested about $57.2 million, of a total $63 million spent on the product by the government and its industrial partners.\n\nLooking for a site in Ontario to serve as a test bed for the ICTS, the government focused on an extension of the eastern end of TTC's Bloor–Danforth line. The TTC had already started building a streetcar line that would extend from the end of the subway at Kennedy station to the Scarborough City Centre, a low-density route passing through industrial land. The TTC was not interested in changing to the ICTS for this route, until the Ontario government, which provided about 80% of the capital costs, stepped in and demanded the ICTS be used. A smaller system in Hamilton, Ontario was also considered, and there was a brief study for a similar system in Ottawa, Ontario. Vancouver, British Columbia was interested in the system as part of the Expo 86 buildout in keeping with the theme, \"Transportation and Communication\". Although the UMTA program in the U.S. was \"de-funded\" that year, Detroit pressed ahead with its plans and signed up in August. Hamilton, Ottawa, Miami, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. were also in talks with UTDC. With three customers lined up, a manufacturing plant was added to the Millhaven site, VentureTrans Manufacturing, which opened in 1982.\n\nIn 1982 UTDC also entered a design to offer rail service to the suburbs east of Toronto, a system known as GO ALRT. ALRT was based on the ICTS technology, but used a longer car about the size of a conventional railway passenger car, and replaced the third rail power with an overhead pantograph. Given the larger sized cars that made mechanical placements easier, conventional motors replaced the linear motor in order to reduce capital costs (the linear motor requires an aluminum \"fourth rail\" for the entire line). However, due to changes in the laws governing the operation of GO trains on the freight railways they ran on, GO was able to improve its schedules without having to build any new infrastructure. ALRT was cancelled in 1985 in favour of conventional heavy rail technology. UTDC later played an important part in this build-out in spite of these changes, and GO eventually built its own twin-track line to Oshawa. Construction of the exclusive guideway had already begun in the early 1980s for GO ALRT, which was then modified shortly after to allow for conventional GO Train service. Work on the exclusive track from Pickering to Whitby was completed in 1988, followed by an extension to Oshawa in 1995 with limited service, which was shortly after pushed back up to all day two-way service, allowing for further expansion of Lakeshore East GO train service.\n\nConstruction of the Toronto and Vancouver systems proceeded apace, with the Scarborough RT opening for service on 22 March 1985, followed by the Vancouver SkyTrain on 11 December 1985, where passenger service on what is today's Expo Line started in January 1986. The systems suffered from serious teething problems; snow froze to the third rail which required the Scarborough RT system to be fitted with protective covers. The braking system was too powerful and caused the wheels to rub flat in spots, which led to noisy running, the opposite of the design goal. Bugs in the automatic control software led to a number of problems with doors that would not open, \"phantom cars\" that would appear mid-line and cause the collision avoidance systems to turn on and freeze trains in place in spite of having a driver. A host of other problems seriously delayed scheduled operations. In Toronto, the Scarborough RT became a subject of ridicule, often closing in heavy snows. Most of the problems with the Toronto and Vancouver systems were worked out by the time the Detroit People Mover opened in July 1987.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the UTDC was involved in the planning of a new light railway in the northwest New Territories, Hong Kong. The corporation was engaged under a bid by Kowloon Wharf to build and operate the system. After Kowloon Wharf pulled out of the project in 1983, citing concerns over the slow pace of development in Tuen Mun New Town, UTDC was among several companies that expressed interest in building the railway, but not in operating it. The Light Rail Transit was eventually built by the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation and opened in 1988.\n\nStarting in 1972, the TTC contracted Hawker Siddeley Canada to design a new streetcar known as the \"Municipal Surface Car\". However, the Government of Ontario had formed the OTDC in the early 1970s, and provided the TTC 75% of its capital funding. The government then demanded that the TTC turn to OTDC for new vehicles.\n\nIn August 1973 the TTC placed an order with the OTDC for 200 new Canadian Light Rail Vehicles (CLRV). The design was purchased from the Swiss company Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG). SIG was contracted to build the first 10 before turning over construction to OTDC, subcontracted at Hawker Siddeley's CC&F factory in Thunder Bay. The prototype run was cut to six, in order to allow four to be converted into an articulated design, the Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (ALRV). UTDC unveiled the ALRV at a June 18–19, 1982 open house at its Transit Development Centre, which over 10,000 people attended.\n\nIn March 1983 Hawker Siddeley Canada sold a portion of its CC&F factory in Thunder Bay to the UTDC, creating the jointly owned Can-Car Rail. Hawker Siddeley had already developed a number of rail vehicles, and with its partnership with UTDC these became the favoured products for a number of contracts in Ontario. In addition to the ICTS, UTDC now had a product portfolio that spanned everything from streetcars to subways to traditional heavy rail passenger cars and hoppers.\n\nIn December 1983 the TTC announced that it was buying 126 subway cars from UTDC, and followed this in February 1984 with an order for 52 ALRVs. The subway cars were built at Can-Car, but after the first ten ALRVs, streetcar production moved to the Millhaven plants which were winding down their ICTS production.\n\nA further run of a modified double-ended ALRVs followed for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, and then a run of 58 subway cars for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston. These were the first of many such orders, and hundreds of subway cars were delivered to various U.S. transport services over the next two decades.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Hawker Siddeley had been designing a new two-level railcar for GO Transit, which they started delivering in 1976 as the BiLevel. GO continued placing additional orders, eventually buying 470 for their service in southern Ontario, where the BiLevel is widely associated with GO.\n\nWhen downsizing hit GO in the early 1990s, a number of these coaches were leased out to various operators in Canada and the US. They were received to rave reviews, and quickly generated orders from operators across North America. Several hundred additional BiLevel cars were built, and over 700 remain in service.\n\nUTDC's Can-Car also produced a number of other products for sales to the Canadian Forces, including versions of the Volkswagen Iltis, the medium-sized M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck and the larger Steyr Percheron.\n\nAs early as 1981 the Government of Ontario had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. The government's concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would find it difficult to make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned.\n\nIn 1986 the new Ontario government announced its intention to sell UTDC to Lavalin, a large engineering company in Montreal, Quebec. Lavalin purchased the company for CAD$50 million, less than the $70 million spent on the UTDC by the government up to 1981. The sale was very controversial at the time: $39 million of several non-performance payments had to be made because of the early problems on the ICTS that had to be paid out by the government. Soon after, Hawker Siddeley announced that it was selling its remaining interest in CC&F to Lavalin as well.\n\nThis was during a period of rapid conglomeration by Lavalin, which included purchases of the Bellechasse Hospital in Montreal, MétéoMédia's television services, and many other businesses that were unrelated to its core engineering strengths. By the early 1990s this aggressive expansion plan led to a massive debt load and serious financial difficulties. In 1991, Lavalin's bankers put it under pressure to be acquired by its chief rival, SNC. Lavalin announced its intent to sell its stake in UTDC, and several companies expressed an interest, including Asea Brown Boveri and Westinghouse. Before this was completed, the company went bankrupt.\n\nAs part of the proceedings, UTDC was returned to the Ontario government, who quickly sold it to Bombardier in 1991. SNC purchased the engineering portions of the company and became SNC-Lavalin, while most other business were sold to other firms.\n\nBombardier quickly re-branded the UTDC products under its growing Bombardier Transportation marque, which started in 1970 with its purchase of Rotax, which made engines used in Bombardier's snowmobiles as well as tramcars. Now in the train business, in 1975 it added the Montreal Locomotive Works and its LRC high-speed train design. Although the LRC was never the success Bombardier hoped, the company continued to buy other rail companies in North America and Europe, dramatically expanding its divisions until, with its purchase of ADtranz in 2001, the largest supplier of rail equipment in the world at the time.\n\nBombardier was much more aggressive in marketing the UTDC product line than either the government or Lavalin had been, especially the ICTS. Bombardier re-designed the cars, expanding the passenger capacity and updating their look, re-introducing the product as the Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit (ART). ART won the contest for the AirTrain JFK project, and an improved design introducing articulating sections between adjacent cars (replacing the coupling and doors of the older (retroactively named) Mark I design) have won several new contests, including the Millennium Line extension of the Vancouver SkyTrain network. ART technology has also been exported outside North America, and is in use on the Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur, the Airport Express in Beijing (in four-car trains), and on the EverLine outside of Seoul. The design has since evolved into the third-generation Bombardier Innovia Metro design and marketed as part of Bombardier's Innovia family of automated transportation products.\n\nVancouver continues to be the largest operator of the ICTS system, with nearly of operational Innovia Metro trackage on two of its SkyTrain lines since the Evergreen Extension began service in 2016. Its entire fleet of Mk I and Mk II trains remain in service and have been supplemented by newly-built Mk III trains.\n\nBombardier also continues to win sales with its other light rail vehicles, including a major expansion of its globally-based Flexity platform to the North American streetcar and light rail markets. In 2009, the TTC selected a derivative of the Flexity Outlook design to replace its legacy fleet and make its entire streetcar network wheelchair-accessible, and in 2010 Metrolinx commissioned a large order of Flexity Freedom LRVs for newly constructed light rail lines in the Greater Toronto Area. Although manufacturing of both the TTC and Metrolinx orders was intended to be completed entirely at the CC&F plants, recurrent delays and other technical problems have led to Bombardier opening a second production line at the former CLC site in Kingston.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Camp (born April 13, 1955) is an American contemporary Christian music artist and pastor who has written or co-written 21 No. 1 singles since his debut in 1978 as a solo artist. In the tradition of Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses, Camp sent out his own 107 theses on Reformation Day (October 31), 1998, calling for a reformation in contemporary Christian music: calling Christian musicians to make direct, uncompromising music that confronts the world with the message of the scriptures.\n\nBorn in Wheaton, Illinois, Camp was raised by Christian parents and by five years of age, he had confessed faith in Jesus. This greatly influenced his desire to serve God through his teenage years. As a young Christian, he created a close bond with legendary Christian singer/songwriter Larry Norman, who gave him advice concerning Camp's own singing and songwriting. In addition, he met the late Keith Green, who encouraged him to make a stronger commitment to Jesus and the ministry of music. Camp was divorced from his first wife prior to 2002. He remarried on June 19, 2009. He is unrelated to Jeremy Camp, a fellow Christian rock musician. Camp is now the senior pastor of The Cross Church in Palm City, Florida.\n\nCamp attended Roosevelt University, where he majored in musical composition and theory. He studied under Ralph Dodds, a protegee of George Gershwin. He also studied business law/music at the College of DuPage. Camp is theologically Reformed, in the tradition of John Owen, Jeremiah Burroughs, Thomas Watson, John F. MacArthur, D.A. Carson, R.C. Sproul and the late Stephen Olford. In the late 1970s, he began a longtime relationship with a then-unknown Rob Frazier, a one-time \"Petra\" member, who co-wrote songs for Camp's own albums. Camp was reunited with Frazier on Frazier's 1992 compilation \"Retrospect\", on which Frazier and Camp sang duet vocals for the song \"Why, Why Why?\" Camp also had a long-term friendship with Scott Wesley Brown, and he played acoustic guitar and sang backups on Brown's 1977 album, \"I'm Not Religious, I Just Love The Lord\", one year before he went on his own. Five of Camp's albums \"Sayin' It With Love\" (1978), \"Start Believin\"' (1980), \"For Every Man\" (1981), \"Only The Very Best\" (1983), and \"It's A Dying World\" (1984) have never been released on CD.\n\nPrior to becoming a conference speaker and lecturer, Camp was a popular contemporary Christian music singer-songwriter. In 1977, he signed a recording contract with Myrrh Records, releasing several songs as a solo artist. In 1983, Camp signed a contract with Sparrow Records, with whom he released nine successful albums. On his first album, \"Fire and Ice\", Camp paired up with Michele Pillar to sing \"Love's Not A Feeling\". In 1989, Camp released his 10th studio album, \"Justice\", on which he recorded a duet with BeBe Winans, entitled \"Do You Feel Their Pain?\" After Camp's contract with Sparrow ended in 1992, he signed with Warner Alliance, with whom he released 2 albums. On his 1993 release \"Taking Heaven By Storm\", Camp teamed up with veteran keyboardist and songwriter Michael Omartian, and together they produced a series of No. 1 hits in a single year (1994), including a contemporary remake of \"The Lord's Prayer\". Later that same year, he released a worship-themed project titled \"Mercy in the Wilderness\".\n\nAlong with other popular contemporary Christian artists of the 1980s, Camp made several front covers of \"CCM Magazine\", \"World Magazine\", and \"Christianity Today\", among many others. At the same time, he also wrote several articles for leading Christian publications, in addition to giving numerous interviews on Christian radio. After recording several albums, Camp began attending Christian conferences and making frequent guest appearances at Christian colleges. In 1996, he was an honorable invitee at the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals Conference, where the Cambridge Document was drafted. One year later, he appeared at the Summit on Church Music Ministry held at Cedarville College in Ohio, contending for sound Biblical theology in Christian music. In late 1998 Camp was once again in Ohio, this time in Celina at a benefit for Harbor House Maternity Home, a Christian home for pregnant teens. 440 people were present to hear Steve do four songs, including Keith Green's \"Asleep in the Light\" and Camp's own \"He's All You Need.\" He followed up his first set of songs with an even more passionate exhortation, possibly causing some in attendance to be a bit uncomfortable with Camp's straightforward approach to his messages: they must do everything possible to save the unborn and be seen as proactively pro-life.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Camp was a frequent guest on radio stations all across the country. Between 1995 and 1997, he also hosted his own radio talk show, \"No Compromise with Steve Camp\". He also made guest appearances on \"The Bible Answer Man\" with Hank Hanegraaff, \"The Janet Parshall Show\", \"The Dick Staub Show\", \"Prime Time America with Jim Warren\", \"Iron Sharpens Iron\", and many more. He is also a well-known writer for the AudienceONE ministries website. , Camp continues to make numerous guest appearances on other radio shows.\n\n\n"}

The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added. \n\nElectronic analytical scales measure the force needed to counter the mass being measured rather than using actual masses. As such they must have calibration adjustments made to compensate for gravitational differences. They use an electromagnet to generate a force to counter the sample being measured and outputs the result by measuring the force needed to achieve balance. Such measurement device is called electromagnetic force restoration sensor.\n\nTriple beam balance is an instrument used to measure mass very precisely. The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam which is the largest size, the front beam which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size . The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry.

{"id": "1810291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810291", "title": "Assamese cuisine", "text": "Assamese cuisine\n\nAssamese cuisine () is the cuisine of Assam. It is a style of cooking that is a confluence of cooking habits of the hills that favor fermentation and drying as forms of preservation and those from the plains that provide fresh vegetables and an abundance of fish and meat. Both are centered on the main ingredient — rice. The confluence of varied cultural influences in the Assam Valley has led to the staggering variety and flavours in the Assamese food. It is characterised by the use of an extremely wide variety of plant as well as animal products, owing to their abundance in the region. It is a mixture of indigenous styles with considerable regional variations and some external influences.\n\nThe cuisine is characterized by very little use of spices, little cooking over fire and strong flavors due mainly to the use of endemic exotic fruits and vegetables that are either fresh, dried or fermented. Fish is widely used, and birds like duck, squab etc. are very popular, which are often paired with a main vegetable or ingredient. Preparations are rarely elaborate. (The practice of bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients so common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam.) The preferred oil for cooking is the pungent mustard oil.\n\nA traditional meal in Assam begins with a \"khar\", a class of dishes named after the main ingredient, and ends with a \"tenga\", a sour dish. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils made by an indigenous community called Mariya. The belief is that when food and water is served in such utensils its good for health and boost up immunity. \"Tamul\" (betel nut, generally raw) and \"paan\" generally concludes the meal.\n\nThough still obscure, this cuisine has seen wider notice in recent times. The discovery of this cuisine in the popular media continues, with the presenters yet to settle on the language and the specific distinctiveness to describe it.\n\nRice is the most important ingredient in this cuisine. The large varieties of rice found in the region has led to speculation that the grain was first domesticated in the Assam-Yunnan region. Both the indica as well as the japonica varieties are grown in Assam. The most popular class of rice is the \"joha\" or scented rice. As a staple, rice is eaten either steam boiled (\"ukhua\") or sundried (\"aaroi\"). Some very fine quality of rice namely, \"Karaballam\" or \"kauribadam\" etc., are available in Assam only.\n\nRice is eaten as snack in many forms: roasted and ground (\"xandoh\"), boiled in its husk and flattened (\"chira\"), puffed (\"akhoi\"). (\"kumol saul\"), a preparation of rice that is precooked, dried and then husked can be simply soaked in warm water and eaten as a light meal.\n\nRice is a part of all meals in Assam. A traditional breakfast consists of \"chira\" with yogurt and jaggery. Mostly farmers eat cooked rice soaked overnight (\"poita\") simply accompanied with salt, mustard oil, onions, etc. Snacks are \"xandoh\", \"kumol saul\" or \"bora saul\", sticky rice, which can be eaten with sweet or salty accompaniments. For other major meals, rice could be boiled, steamed or wrapped in leaves and roasted. 'Sunga Saul' is a special preparation in which (sticky) rice (\"bora saul\") is cooked in bamboo hollows called 'sunga'. 'Sewa diya Bhaat' is another preparation where sticky rice is steamed over boiling water. They are generally served with meat or fish. Sticky rice is also wrapped in leaves, usually plantain leaves or \"tora pat\", and dropped into boiling water to prepare 'tupula bhat'.\n\nA special class of rice preparations, called pithas are generally made only on special occasions like the Bihu. Made usually with soaked and ground glutinous rice (bora saul), they could be fried in oil with a sesame filling (\"xutuli pitha\"), roasted in young green bamboo over a slow fire (sunga pitha) or baked and rolled over a hot plate with a filling (\"kholasaporia pitha\").\n\nThe next most important ingredient is fish, harvested from the many rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. The extremely wet climate and the large numbers of water bodies has ensured that large varieties of fresh water fish are available in abundance in the valley. It is a staple item in the Assamese palate. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for pisciculture. Some of the most popular big fishes are the \"Borali\" (freshwater dhark), \"rou\", and \"cital\" (big), \"khoria\" (medium) (Chitala chitala), \"maagur\", Xingi, \"borali\", \"bhokua\" or \"bahu\", \"Xaal\", \"Xol\", etc. The small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam like \"puthi\", \"Ari\" (long-whiskered catfish), \"Goroi\" (green snake head/ spotted snake head ), \"Koi\" or \"Kawoi\" (climbing perch \"Anabas testudineus\"), \"Kholihona\" (Indian paradise fish \"Ctenops nobilis\") \"borolia\", \"mua\", \"ceniputhi\", \"tengera\", \"lachin\", \"bhangun\", \"pabho\", etc. The discerning gourmet can tell which region of Assam is known for which variety of fish. \n\nThe \"mas tenga\" (sour fish ), which is commonly eaten by most communities of Assam, has lately turned into a signature dish of Assamese cuisine. The most popular souring agent for the \"tenga\" is tomatoes, though ones made with \"kajinemu\" juice (thick skinned elongated lemon) and \"thekera\" (dried mangosteen,) are also popular.\n\nThe most common way of eating fish in traditional Assamese homes is by preparing a stew with herbs, vegetables, and greens as per preference and availability. Fish is also prepared by roasting or char-grilling. A favorite is a small fish roasted in banana leaves (\"paatotdia\"). \"Hukoti\" is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish like (\"puthi maas\") pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of northeast India in general and Assam in particular. Dried and fermented small fish \"puthy mas\" (Ticto barb), three to four in number, are roasted with lavish amounts of green chilis, tomatoes, ginger and garlic (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice. Fish eggs and innards are also cooked and consumed.\n\n\nThe Assamese meat and fish dishes are characterized by a low amount of spices and oil, higher quantity of ginger, noroxinghow paat (curry leaves), Khorisa (fermented bamboo shoot) and lemon juice, and differ completely in taste from the dishes of neighboring Bengal and are quite similar to the cuisines of nearby South-East Asian and East Asian countries. Chicken, Venison, Squab, Mutton, Duck and Pork is very popular among the indigenous ethnic Assamese communities like Sonowals, Bodo, Rabha, Keot (Kaibarta), Ahom, Moran, Sutiya etc. Upper caste Assamese Hindus, such as Assamese Brahmins (including Ganaks) and Kayasthas of Assam, Kalitas of Lower Assam refrain from pork consumption. Beef is occasionally consumed by Assamese Muslims, although they traditionally refrain from consuming pork. The Christians, many indigenous Assamese communities, and the non religious sections consume all types of meat.\n\nThe basic cooking methods include cooking, shallow and deep frying. \"Onla\", of the Bodos, is made with ground rice and special herbs and constitutes a complete meal in itself. Other meats include squab, duck, chicken, goat meat, venison, and turtle although venison and turtle meat are legally prohibited. The combination of duck/white gourd and squab/papaya or\nbanana flower is very popular. Meat is generally stewed using limited spices as well as a choice of herbs and vegetables.\n\nMost communities of Assam are entomophagous. Various indigenous ethnic groups of certain areas partake of the silkworm, water bugs, grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried or cooked or roasted in leaves and then prepared according to the timing of the meal. The red ant egg is considered a delicacy during the Rongali Bihu festival.\n\nThe environs of Assam are rich in vegetation, and green leafy vegetables, called \"xaak\", are an important part of the cuisine. Some of them are grown while others like the \"dhekia\" (fern) grows wild. There is a bewildering variety that is eaten and according to custom, one has to have 101 different \"xaak\" (greens) during Rongali Bihu. Herbs, greens, and vegetables are commonly eaten by simply cooking in water and salt, lightly frying, as a thick soup or by adding to varieties of lentils. They are also prepared in combination with fish, meat and eggs.\n\nAmong spices there are ginger, garlic, onion, cumin seed, black cumin, black pepper, chilli, turmeric, coriander seed, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, fenugreek seed, white mustard seed, aniseed, Malabar leaf, Cumin, etc. Some herbs peculiar to Assam are \"maan dhaniya\", \"moran Ada\", \"madhuhulong\", \"bhedai lota\", \"manimuni\", \"masundari\" etc. An Assamese meal is incomplete without green chilis, many varieties of which are available in the region. Assam is famous for the bhut jolokia or \"ghost pepper\" which was recognized as the hottest chili in the world. \"Panch-furan (mixture of 5 spices)\" is used for adding flavour to Dal.\n\nAlthough modern cuisine of Assam has been influenced by east and north Indian cuisine, Assam is still rich in traditional dishes.\n\nThe khar is a signature class of preparations made with a key ingredient, also called khar. The traditional ingredient is made by filtering water through the ashes of the sun-dried skin of a few varieties of banana, which is then called \"kola khar\" (The name derived from the local term for banana, \"kol\" or \"kola.\") A traditional meal invariably begins with a \"khar\" dish, which can be prepared with raw papaya, mustard leaves, vegetables, pulses, fish or any other main ingredient.\n\nXôkôta is a severely bitter type of preparation. It is prepared with dry jute leaf, urad bean and \"khar\". However, the combination of \"khar\" (alkaline) and \"tenga\" (acidic) is not recommended. The liquid khar is also simply eaten as \"kharoli\" with rice which is prepared by adding a few drops of mustard oil. Assamese people have a peculiar tradition of eating a large variety of bitter dishes, many of which are considered delicacies. Some dishes in this category include, \"fresh bamboo shoot\", cooked or lightly fried, \"cane shoot\", Neem leaves fried, \"titabhekuri\", bitter gourd, \"Xukuta\", \"Titaphool\", \"Sewali Phool\" etc.\n\nThe \"masor tenga\" is a light and sour fish dish, another signature class of preparations. There are numerous ways of preparing the sour fish curry among Assamese people. The souring ingredient could be mangosteen, lemon, etc., but the most popular is made with tomatoes. Another important ingredient is kokum. Fish dishes made with fermented bamboo shoot (khorisa) are generally sour, but they are not called \"tenga\". Fish is fried in mustard oil or stewed with bottle gourd or spinach. Another \"tenga\" dish is prepared with \"matimah\" (urad bean) and \"outenga\" (elephant apple). Bottle gourd can be added to it. \"Tengamora\" or \"noltenga\" and lentil is a distinct \"tenga\" curry.\n\nThe \"narasingh masor jhol\" is another authentic dish from Assam.The fishes are cooked in a light gravy of curry leaves which is a common aromatic herb used in southern and some northern parts of India. The curry leaves are also known as noro-shingho paat in Assamese. The fish preparations in Assam emphasize on retaining the natural flavors of the fishes and hence few spices are used.\n\nPura refers to various forms of grilled and roasted food. Vegetables, meat and fish are often served in this form. Aalu bengena pura pitika, pura maas pitika (mashed grilled fish), pura mankho etc. are a few of the popular dishes.\n\n\"Poitabhat\" is a favourite dish in Assam during the summer season. Cooked rice is soaked overnight and left to ferment. It is and served with mustard oil, onion, chili, pickles, \"pitika\" (mashes), etc. The 'poitabhat' preparation is sometimes made alcoholic according to preference.\n\nSide dishes called \"pitika - পিটিকা\" (mashes) is a signature characteristic of this cuisine. The most popular is \"aloo pitika - আলু পিটিকা\" (mashed potatoes) garnished with raw onions, mustard oil, green chillies and sometimes boiled eggs. \"Khorisa tenga\" is mashed fermented bamboo shoot, sometimes pickled in mustard oil and spices. \"Kharoli\" is fermented mashed mustard (\"Brassica campestris\" var. toria) seed to which a \"khar\" has been added, and \"kahudi\" to which an acidic agent (lemon juice, dried mangosteen) has been added. \"Pitika\"s are also made from roasted or steamed vegetables (tomatoes and eggplants being very popular). Small fish, asiatic pennywort, \"matikaduri\", \"tengamora\" leaves, heartleaf, \"dôrôn\" (\"Leucus longifolia\"), etc. are roasted separately wrapped in banana leaves and mashed into 'pitika'.\n\nPickles are made of mango, indian gooseberry, hog plum, Indian olive, Tamarind, star fruit, mangosteen, radish, carrot, elephant apple, Indian jujube, chili, lime, garlic, etc. Panitenga and kharoli are signature Assamese pickles made from ground mustard seeds.\n\nChutney is made of coriander, spinach, tomato, heartleaf, curry leaf, chilli, lentil, chickpea etc. \"Xukan masor chutney\" (chutney made of dried fish) is popular among the tribal communities. Salad is made of carrot, radish, tomato, cucumber, beetroot, etc.\n\n'Bora' are fried balls of mashed lentil or gram — it is equivalent to vada in few other Indian languages. It may contain other green leafy vegetable locally called 'xaak' within it, and it is best while served with 'teteli' (tamarind) curry or dip. There is a huge variety of 'bora' preparations in Assamese cuisine. The base ingredients include greens, vegetables, fruits, flowers, skin, and shoots of various plants. 'Bora' can also be prepared from fish eggs etc.\n\nFritter is made of flower and tender leaves of pumpkin, banana, tender leaves of bottle gourd, eggplant, tender leaves of night-flowering jasmine, etc.\n\nSome other preparations in Assamese cuisine include \"Kahudi\", \"Panitenga\", \"Khorikatdiya\", \"Tenga sorsoriya\", \"Posola\", etc.\n\nLiquor is an integral part of linguistically and culturally diverse communities in Assamaese society. Rice is a primary ingredient for the many rice beers (\"Nam-lao - নাম-লাও\") and liquors made in Assam by different ethnic communities: \"zou\" (Bodo), \"Aapong\" (Mishing),\"mod(মদ) \" (Sonowal Kacharis), \"Chuje\" (Chutia), \"Nam-lao -নাম-লাও\" (Tai-Ahom), \"Haj\" (Tiwa), \"Hor\" (Karbi), \"Photika - ফটিকা\" (Kachari), etc.\n\n\"Jolpan\" (snacks) in Assamese is what is breakfast although it is not always served as breakfast in Assamese cuisine. They are eaten as light meals between main meals and widely served during Bihu, weddings, Assamese \"shraadh\"s or any other kind of special occasions and gatherings. Some types of jolpan are \"Bora saul\" (varieties of sticky rice), \"Komal Saul\", \"Xandoh\", \"Chira\", \"Muri\", \"Akhoi\", Sunga saul, etc. eaten in combination with hot milk, curd, jaggery, yogurt or seasonal ripe fruits. These are probably some of the earliest forms of \"cereals\". Assamese people have been eating them mainly as breakfast for many centuries.\n\n\"Pitha\" (rice cake) is a special class of rice preparation generally made only on occasions like Bihu in Assam. Made usually with soaked and ground rice, they could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate. Some pithas are \"Til Pitha\", \"Ghila Pitha\", \"Xutuli Pitha\", \"Sunga Pitha\", \"Bhapotdiya Pitha\", \"Lakhimi Pitha\", \"Tora Pitha\", \"Tekeli Pitha\", \"Deksi Pitha\", \"Muthiya Pitha\", \"Kholasapori Pitha\", etc.\n\nIt is made in other areas such as West Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa (Odhisa), Delhi, Punjab, etc.\n\nLarus are sweet balls that are associated with traditional Assamese food: \"Laskara\", narikolor laru, \"tilor laru\" are often seen in Assamese cuisine.\n\nTea (\"Saah\" in Assamese) is an indispensable part of Assamese cuisine. It is served in form of Black tea, Milk tea, Spiced tea, Green Tea, Lemon tea (adding lemon juice to black tea), etc.\n\nSome other snacks include roti, luchi, and ghugni.\n\nAn Assamese meal is generally concluded with the chewing of \"Tamul\" (). Pieces of Betel nut (\"Areca Catechu\") are eaten in combination with Betel leaf (\"Piper betle\"), edible limestone and tobacco. It is a routine item after every meal.\n\n\n. http://bhogalijalpan.com/\n"}
{"id": "1810304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810304", "title": "Dave Bassett", "text": "Dave Bassett\n\nDavid Thomas Bassett (born 4 September 1944 in Stanmore), also frequently known by his nickname of Harry, is an English football manager and a former player. During his career he has managed Wimbledon, Watford, Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Barnsley, Leicester City and Southampton.\n\nAs a player Bassett was a defensive midfielder at semi-professional level, playing for Hayes between 1961 and 1963, returning to the club on two occasions from 1964 to 1966 and 1968 to 1969. He also played for Wycombe Wanderers in 1963–64, for St Albans City, where he made 11 appearances in the 1967–68 season and for Walton & Hersham between 1969 and 1974, where he was captain of the side that won the FA Amateur Cup in 1973. He was capped by England at amateur level.\n\nHe joined Wimbledon in 1974 and was part of the Wimbledon team who, in the 1975 FA Cup, famously beat First Division Burnley away in the 3rd round and then forced a draw in the 4th round at reigning League Champions Leeds United, before losing narrowly 1–0 (the goal being a wide shot that deflected in off Bassett's knee) in the replay.\n\nBassett made a total of 141 appearances for Wimbledon whilst in the Southern League, 99 league and 42 cup: 53 appearances in 1974–75 scoring two goals, 43 in 1975–76 scoring two goals and 45 in 1976–77. In the Football League, Bassett made 39 appearances for Wimbledon: 35 league, one FA Cup and three League Cup, scoring once. Bassett also made 10 amateur international appearances whilst playing for Walton & Hersham.\n\nHe retired from playing and became assistant manager soon after Wimbledon won election to the Football League in 1977 under the management of Dario Gradi.\n\nBassett was promoted to first team manager following the departure of Dario Gradi to Crystal Palace in January 1981, when Wimbledon were ninth in the Fourth Division. Wimbledon's form improved substantially following Bassett's appointment, and a 4–1 home win over Rochdale on 28 April 1981 (the penultimate game of the season) secured promotion to the Third Division.\n\nWimbledon initially struggled at the higher level during 1981–82, Bassett's first full season in charge, and they spent most of the season in a relegation battle. Despite winning four of their last five games of the season, they were still relegated back to the Fourth Division on goal difference, in 21st place.\n\nAn excellent campaign in 1982–83 saw Bassett guide Wimbledon to promotion as the Fourth Division championship title winners with 98 points – the highest in any Football League division that year.\n\nAlthough Wimbledon lost their first two games back in the Third Division, they crushed Newport County (who had narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division the previous season) 6–0 at home in the third game of the league campaign, and by Christmas they were genuine promotion contenders. Promotion was sealed on the penultimate day of the season with Bolton Wanderers beating Sheffield United 3–1.\n\nIn June 1984, Bassett accepted an offer to become manager of Second Division club Crystal Palace, but changed his mind within 72 hours, refused to sign the contract at Selhurst Park, and returned to Wimbledon, stating that \"I gave it some serious thought, but in the end it just did not feel right. We have unfinished business, and I didn't really want to leave here.\"\n\nWimbledon's life as a Second Division club began with a notable 2–2 home draw against promotion favourites Manchester City on the opening day of the 1984–85 season. Wimbledon finally managed a secure 12th-place finish.\n\nThe 1985–86 season began well at Plough Lane, with a comfortable 3-0 home win over a financially troubled Middlesbrough. By the end of October 1985, Wimbledon were third in the league and were contenders for a third promotion in four seasons – a feat previously achieved only by Swansea City. On the final day of the season, a 1–1 draw at Bradford City saw Wimbledon seal the third and final promotion place to reach the First Division, only a mere nine years after joining the Football League.\n\nIn the 1986–87 season, Wimbledon got off to a dream start in the First Division and a 1–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 2 September 1986 put them top of the league. They stayed top the following week, until they were overtaken by Nottingham Forest eleven days later. Wimbledon's form for the remainder of the autumn was less impressive, as they finished October in 14th place, but they steadily recovered as the season went on and achieved a highly impressive sixth place in the league with 66 points – ahead of Manchester United. Bassett also guided his team to a shock 3–1 over eventual league champions Everton in the FA Cup fifth round, though their hopes of cup glory were put on hold for a year when they lost 2–0 at home to Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter final.\n\nWhilst still hugely popular with both the club's fans and his own players, Bassett resigned from the club in June 1987, after chairman Sam Hammam attempted to insert a clause into Bassett's contract that would allow Hammam to veto Bassett's team selections. Taking the vacant job at Watford, Bassett handed the reins at Wimbledon to Bobby Gould.\n\nBassett's reign as Watford manager was short-lived. The team had just finished ninth in the 1986–87 season under the management of Graham Taylor, who had left to take charge of relegated Aston Villa. Before Bassett's arrival, Watford also sold John Barnes to Liverpool but, instead of retaining the nucleus of the successful side of the mid-80s, he sold several other first-team regulars including Kevin Richardson, David Bardsley and Lee Sinnott, and also dropped Tony Coton, arguably Watford's best ever goalkeeper. Their replacements did not do as well, and when Watford started the 1987–88 season in poor form, the blame was placed on Bassett who was sacked in January 1988 with the club bottom of the First Division and relegation to the Second Division looking inevitable.\n\nIn 1987–88, Bassett became one of the few managers to have the dubious honour of being involved with two relegated clubs in the same season. On 21 January 1988, just days after leaving Watford, he took over at Sheffield United. Despite bringing in several new players, he was unable to prevent an already weak team from sliding into the Third Division after losing the double-legged play-off with Bristol City 2–1\n\nHowever, with Bassett bringing his own backroom staff during the close season and more new players brought in, he took them back up at the first attempt in 1988–89. A second successive promotion following in 1989–90, and First Division football returned to Bramall Lane in the 1990–91 season for the first time since the 1970s. An influential player in this team was striker Brian Deane, who was capped three times by England.\n\nSheffield United failed to win any of their first 16 league games in 1990–91, breaking a First Division record in the process, and went into the new year at the bottom of the First Division. But a rousing resurgence in the second half of the season saw the Blades climb up to a secure 13th place in the final table. They did even better in 1991–92, finishing ninth in the First Division and securing a place in the new Premier League.\n\nSheffield United's Premier League debut was reasonable. They finished 14th in the final table, reached the semi finals of the FA Cup, and condemned Nottingham Forest to relegation by winning the penultimate game of the season. However, when Brian Deane was sold to Leeds United during the 1993 close season, without him the Blades struggled. Bassett's luck finally ran out on the last day of the 1993–94 season. Needing a single point to avoid relegation, they lost 3–2 at Chelsea, having led 2–1 with 5 minutes remaining. An eighth-place finish in the 1994–95 Division One campaign was not enough for a play-off place, and Bassett resigned the following December with relegation looking more likely than promotion and protests against the board mounting.\n\nBassett took over at Crystal Palace in early February 1996, taking charge of a club which was standing in 16th place in Division One and had lost most of its players the previous summer. Bassett set about rejuvenating the side, and a remarkable run of form meant that automatic promotion was still a possibility until the penultimate game of the season. In the end, they finished third in the table and reached the playoff final where they lost 2–1 in extra time to Leicester City.\n\nIn March 1997, Bassett left Crystal Palace to take joint charge of Premier League strugglers Nottingham Forest with former Forest and England player Stuart Pearce. He was unable to prevent them from being relegated, but they were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt under his sole charge after winning the 1997–98 Division One championship. But Forest had a very poor start to the 1998–99 Premier League, and Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with \"player power\" cited as a reason. Forest were unable to avoid the drop under Bassett's successor Ron Atkinson.\n\nBassett succeeded John Hendrie as Barnsley manager in May 1999. In his first season at the helm Barnsley reached the Division One play-off final but missed out on promotion to the Premier League after losing to Ipswich Town. Bassett left in December 2000 after failing to mount another promotion challenge. He was linked with a move to succeed Colin Lee at fellow Division One club Wolverhampton Wanderers, but when Lee's successor was announced in the new year it was Dave Jones, formerly of Southampton, and not Bassett, who took the role.\n\nBassett became Leicester City manager in October 2001. A four-month winless run from December condemned the team to relegation from the Premier League after a six-year tenancy. After a 1–0 defeat to Manchester United which confirmed Leicester's relegation, Bassett became Director of Football, handing over his managerial duties to assistant Micky Adams. He took over as manager again on 11 October 2004 after Adams' resignation, but left his Director of Football role after Craig Levein was appointed as Adams' replacement.\n\nBassett was appointed as assistant manager to Harry Redknapp at Southampton in the summer of 2005, after the departure of Jim Smith. When Redknapp left in December 2005, Bassett became the caretaker manager, in a shared role with Dennis Wise. He left the club on 23 December 2005 after George Burley was appointed full-time manager of the Saints. Bassett stated that he had been led to believe by the chairman that he was the players' choice as next manager. During his brief sojourn in charge at St Mary's, Saints played three matches, with one victory, one draw and one defeat.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Bassett acted as a \"consultant\" to then-manager Aidy Boothroyd during the club's spell in the Premier League.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, Bassett was appointed as assistant manager to Dennis Wise at Leeds United for the remainder of the 2007/08 season.

Often stationed in the extreme front of the aircraft, on the way to the target and after releasing the bombs, he could also serve as the front gunner in aircraft that had a front turret.\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, the title of bombardier fell into disuse, due largely to changes in technology, emanating from the replacement of this manual function with the development of computerized technology and smart bombs, that has given rise to terms like weapon systems officer or combat systems officer to describe the modern role. The equivalent in the US Navy and US Marine Corps is the naval flight officer.\n\nIn the United States, the position of bombardier was originally held by a sergeant, but they were commissioned as officers in 1941. In the Commonwealth, a bomb aimer could be an officer or (more frequently) a senior non-commissioned officer (sergeant or flight sergeant) or warrant officer; like wireless operators, air engineers and air gunners, all officer bomb aimers were commissioned from the ranks after non-commissioned aircrew service, unlike pilots and navigators who could also join directly as commissioned officers.\n\nDuring World War II, US Army Air Forces bombardiers were recognized with the award of the Bombardier Badge. With the establishment of an independent US Air Force in 1947, USAF bombardiers were awarded the wings known as the Navigator badge, now known as the Combat Systems Officer badge. Commonwealth bomb aimers wore a single-wing aircrew brevet with the letter \"B\".\n\nThe aircraft of the United Kingdom's V bomber force carried two navigators, one of whom acted as bomb aimer, although having the official title of \"navigator radar\".\n"}

In 1971, the then-financially struggling Western Flyer was sold to the Manitoba Development Corporation, an agency of the Manitoba government, and renamed Flyer Industries Limited. In 1974 the opposition Progressive Convservative party of Manitoba had urged the NDP government in power to sell of Flyer Industries from government ownership.\n\nOn July 15, 1986, Jan den Oudsten, a descendant of the family who formed Dutch bus manufacturer Den Oudsten Bussen BV, purchased Flyer Industries from the Manitoba government, changing its name to New Flyer Industries Limited.\n\nIn March 2002, New Flyer was acquired by KPS Capital Partners, an investment company that specializes in turning around struggling businesses.

{"id": "1810326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810326", "title": "Battle of Falkirk Muir", "text": "Battle of Falkirk Muir\n\nThe Battle of Falkirk Muir (), also known as the Battle of Falkirk took place on 17 January 1746 during the Jacobite rising of 1745. While considered a tactical Jacobite victory, it had little impact on the campaign.\n\nIn early January, the Jacobite army besieged Stirling Castle and on 13 January, government forces under Henry Hawley advanced north from Edinburgh to relieve it. He arrived at Falkirk on 15 January and the Jacobites attacked late in the afternoon of 17 January.\n\nFought in failing light and heavy snow, Hawley's left wing was routed but his right held firm; in the confusion, the Jacobites failed to follow up, allowing the government troops to withdraw and regroup in Edinburgh. When they resumed their advance on 30 January, the Jacobites abandoned the siege and withdrew to Inverness, before the rebellion ended at the Battle of Culloden in April.\n\nThe battlefield has been inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Historic Environment (Amendment) Act 2011.\n\nAlthough the invasion of England had few tangible benefits, reaching Derby and returning to Scotland was a considerable military achievement. This brought in new recruits, while in late November, John Drummond arrived from France with weapons, money and 150 Irish and Scots regulars. In early January, Jacobite morale and numbers were at their peak, with 8,000 to 9,000 effectives.\n\nSuccess at Inverurie on 23 December gave the Jacobites temporary control of the North-East, which they now attempted to extend to the Central Lowlands. Their objective was Stirling Castle, one of the strongest fortifications in Scotland and a position of major strategic importance that controlled access between the Highlands and the Lowlands. \n\nSplit into two columns, the main army left Glasgow on 4 January for Stirling, where they would rendezvous with Drummond's troops. Lord George Murray and the first column marched on Falkirk, then turned north towards Stirling, leaving a cavalry detachment under Lord Elcho at Linlithgow to patrol the Edinburgh road. The second passed through Kilsyth, en route to Bannockburn, where Prince Charles established his headquarters at Bannockburn House, owned by the Jacobite Sir Hugh Paterson.\n\nThe town of Stirling quickly surrendered but the castle was a far greater challenge, with strong defences and a garrison of 600 to 700 troops, under William Blakeney, an experienced and determined Irish veteran. Siege operations began on 8 January but for a number of reasons, progress was slow. On 13 January, Henry Hawley, government commander in Scotland, ordered his deputy Major General John Huske and 4,000 men to advance on Stirling, while he followed with another 3,000. They reached Falkirk on 15 January and made camp just outside the town; Murray withdrew to Plean Muir, southeast of Bannockburn, where he was joined by Charles and O' Sullivan, with all the troops that could be spared from the siege.\n\nDeficiencies in leadership on both sides would have a significant impact on the battle. Hawley had commanded dragoons at Sheriffmuir in 1715 and overestimated the vulnerability of Highlanders to cavalry, while seriously underestimating their fighting qualities and numbers. The Jacobite senior command was divided between Charles and his exile advisors on the one hand and the Scots on the other, with several of Charles' aides openly stating Murray was a traitor.\nWhen Hawley failed to attack on 16 January, Murray, Charles and O'Sullivan agreed to take the offensive on the morning of the 17th. Some of Drummond's regulars marched towards Stirling to distract the government scouts, while Murray's Highlanders took up position on the high ground to the south, above the camp. They were helped by Hawley's assumption they would not dare attack him and his location a mile away at Callendar House. According to an aide, they 'beat to Arms' at 12:00, then stood down and it was not until 14:30 Hawley realised the seriousness of the situation. The weather suddenly changed and it began raining and snowing heavily, with a strong wind blowing directly into the faces of Hawley's troops.\n\nThe government army moved south on Maggie Wood's Loan past the Bantaskin House and up the slope of the Falkirk ridge. Despite their failure at Prestonpans, the dragoons led the way, an order their commander Francis Ligonier allegedly viewed as 'the most extraordinary ever given.' Their horses churned the track into a morass, slowing the infantry, while the guns in the rear became stuck and could not be freed in time to take part in the battle. The rain also affected the infantry's black powder cartridges; it was later estimated one out of every four muskets misfired.\n\nThe dragoons halted on the far side of the rise, with a bog to their left while the infantry deployed to their right (see Map). The front line consisted of the dragoons, then six battalions of veteran infantry; a second line with five more infantry battalions, then Howard's regiment and 1,000 men of the Argyll Militia behind. The inexperienced Glasgow militia were not considered front-line troops and deployed several hundred yards behind the dragoons on the left.\n\nOpposing them was a first line composed of the Highland regiments, Lowland units behind, then a small number of cavalry and 150 regulars from the French Irish Brigade in the rear. Murray dismounted and marched with the MacDonalds on the extreme right, opposite the dragoons; crucially, he ensured they remained in line and ordered his front rank not to fire until he gave the word.\n\nMurray later declared the position selected meant 'the Highland army had all the advantages nature or art could give them.' However, it was undermined by poor co-ordination and Drummond, who was appointed to command the Jacobite left, was absent when the battle began. He arrived soon after but this meant it lacked a senior commander at the start of action and while Murray urged Charles to name an alternative, he failed to do so.\nJust after 16:00, Ligonier and his three regiments of dragoons attacked the MacDonalds, who waited until they came within pistol range, then fired a single volley. As at Prestonpans, they fled in disorder; restricted by the bog to their left, Cobham's regiment went north while the other two rode over the infantry forming to their rear. In a few minutes, the entire left-wing was swept away; all that remained for the Jacobites to achieve an overwhelming victory was to envelop Hawley's right.\n\nHowever, the MacDonalds and entire front line charged down the hill and began sacking the government camp, while the sloping terrain and lack of visibility left Murray unable to ascertain who was where. Three battalions under Huske and Cholmondeley held their positions, shielded by the ravine to their front and repulsed attacks by the Jacobite left. These fled in their turn and according to O'Sullivan, many did not stop until they reached Stirling 'where they gave out we lost the day'. The darkness, continuing storm and general confusion on both sides ended the battle; Hawley initially withdrew to Falkirk but most of his army was spread out on the road to Linlithgow and they eventually returned to Edinburgh where they reformed.\n\nThe artillery commander, Captain Archibald Cunningham, abandoned his guns and used the transport horses to escape. When Huske's men retreated, they dragged some of the guns with them but most were left behind; Cunningham later committed suicide 'by opening the arteries of his arms.' Ligonier, who left his sickbed in Edinburgh to take command, died shortly afterwards while the severity of the weather is demonstrated by the fact Cholmondeley suffered from severe exposure.\n\nAs in most battles of the period, many casualties occurred in the pursuit, a pattern repeated at Culloden in April but with the roles reversed. It is generally accepted the Jacobites lost 50 dead and 80 wounded, mostly on their left, while the government forces lost around 70 dead, plus another 200-300 wounded or missing. Twenty of the dead were officers, including Sir Robert Munro and his younger brother Duncan, who were killed in the pursuit and later buried in St Modan's, Falkirk.\n\nWhile a Jacobite success, Falkirk is often described as a 'hollow' victory, since poor command and co-ordination deprived them of the last opportunity to decisively defeat their opponents. One factor was confusion over the result; from their position on the left, Charles and O'Sullivan initially thought they had been defeated. Murray publicly blamed Drummond for arriving late and not supporting his success on the right, while Drummond blamed Murray for the failure of the three MacDonald regiments to press home their attack. Murray also accused O'Sullivan of cowardice, although Sheridan's official Jacobite account credited him with rallying \"part of the left wing\". Amid these recriminations, Charles returned to Bannockburn, where he fell ill, leaving Murray and the Highlanders at Falkirk.\n\nOn 29 January, Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh and assumed command. A number of soldiers were later executed for desertion; Hawley's poor leadership materially assisted the Jacobites but unlike Sir John Cope, he never faced a court-martial. The writer Horace Walpole (1717-1792) argued he was 'fifty times more culpable, since Cope miscarried by incapacity, Hawley by insolence and carelessness.'\n\nThe exiles failed to appreciate that while the military obligations of clan society allowed the chiefs to provide large numbers of men at short notice, the obligation assumed warfare was short-term and rarely took place in the winter. After a successful battle like Prestonpans, many went home to secure their loot and the clan chiefs could not prevent a similar flood of 'desertions' after Falkirk. When Cumberland resumed his advance on 30 January, Charles asked Murray to prepare a battle plan but was told the army was in no state to fight. This destroyed the last remnants of trust between the two parties; on 1 February 1746, the siege of Stirling was abandoned and the Jacobites withdrew to Inverness.\n\nSeveral songs were written commemorating the battle, including \"The Highlandmen Came Down the Hill\" and \"The Battle of Falkirk Muir,\" a satirical attack on General Hawley intended to be sung to the tune of the song \"Up and Waur Them A', Willie.\" Both songs are in the Scots language and bear little resemblance to the Gaelic musical tradition, revealing their lowland origins despite commenting on Highland affairs. They first appeared in James Hogg's Jacobite Relics, and scholars such as Franklyn Bliss Snyder have noted that they were \"surely retrospective, and possibly [Hogg's] own work.\"\n\nThe celebrated Gaelic poet Duncan Ban MacIntyre, who had participated in the battle fighting for the Hanoverian side as a substitute for a Falkirk gentleman, wrote two poems about his experiences.\n\n\n"}

MC Breed's first album was released with rap group DFC and was entitled \"MC Breed & DFC\" for independent record label, SDEG Records. His solo debut was 1992's \"20 Below\", after which he released 1993's \"The New Breed\". He would go on to have a very extensive discography and have a very long career that was at times successful, but he never fully broke into the mainstream. His highest charting album was 1994's \"Funkafied\", which peaked at #106 on the Billboard Hot 200. Through his career he would align himself with various rap scenes.

The album featured the Jazze Pha produced hit, \"Let's Go To The Club\", and a guest appearance from Bootleg of the Dayton Family. The album liner notes advertised many upcoming releases, including a collaboration album between Breed and Bootleg under the group name \"Flintstones\", and a movie starring Breed with an accompanying soundtrack titled \"Got To Get Mine\".

It was founded by Tupeni Baba, a former Deputy Prime Minister and Labour Party stalwart, who had become dissatisfied with Mahendra Chaudhry's leadership and expressed fears that if Chaudhry, who had been deposed in the Fiji coup of 2000, returned as Prime Minister, there could be another coup. Other prominent Fijians associated with the party included \"Ratu\" Meli Vesikula.\n\nIn the parliamentary election of 2001, the New Labour Unity Party called for the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary, which had been undermined by government defiance. It also advocated a reduction in Value Added Tax, and for its complete removal on essential items. A NLUP government would work to build a non-racialist Fiji in the ethic of \"love thy brother,\" and would ban all forms of unfair discrimination. It also called for a parliamentary code of conduct to end corruption. The party won two of the 45 seats it contested, but Baba himself was defeated. During the campaign, the party had been hurt by revelations that it had received F$200,000 from Peter Foster, a controversial Australian businessman who had been convicted of fraud. Foster actually invested over $1 million in supporting New Labour and ran what was described as a very slick and professional election campaign. Foster said he supported Dr Baba because he saw him as the \"Nelson Mandela of the South Pacific.\"\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the NLUP delegation split after the election. Kenneth Zinck joined the government benches and was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Labour, Industrial Relations, and Productivity, while Ofa Swann decided to join the Opposition. Most members of the party decided in June 2002 to join with three other parties to form the new Fiji Democratic Party, under the leadership of Filipe Bole. This party dissolved itself in April 2005, in order to join the newly formed National Alliance Party of Fiji, led by \"Ratu\" Epeli Ganilau. A rump of the NLUP continues under the leadership of Tomasi Tokalauvere, a trade unionist. The party secretary is Loraini Tulele.\n\nOn 5 December 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that the NLUP had expelled Zinck from the party, following his refusal to quit his Cabinet portfolio and join the opposition, saying that his decision breached the party's 2001 election manifesto. Zinck had allegedly ignored several warnings from the party that he would be expelled if he did not resign from the Cabinet, as directed. As of August 2005, however, Zinck is still officially registered by the Fijian Parliament as a member of the NLUP.\n\nOn 21 August, Zinck confirmed reports that Tokalauvere was trying to have the party deregistered.

The company is a subsidiary of Volvo.\n\nThe company was founded in 1924 by Eugène Prévost (1898–1965), a cabinet maker specializing in church pews and school furniture, who in 1924 was asked to build a custom bus body for a new REO truck chassis. \"Les Ateliers Prévost\", as the company was then called, received several repeat orders. Between 1937 and 1939, Prévost Car's first bus manufacturing plant was built. Initially the vehicles were built around a wooden frame. In 1945 this changed, and bodies were made of metal.\n\nThe company was acquired by Paul Normand in 1957. In 1969, two American businessmen formed a partnership with André Normand, then President of Prévost, to become the company's owners. These three men, in turn, sold Prévost to Volvo Bus Corporation in 1995.\n\nAs of February 2007, the firm has 1,337 employees. \n\nAs of June 2019, Prevost operates 15 parts and service centers in North America, nine of them in the United States.\n\nThe latest models saw the XLII thoroughly revised, with a longer wheelbase for more storage and a smoother ride. This, and other changes, marked the beginning of the new X3-45.\n\nThe flagship H3-45 received some further enhancements in 2006 with GPS and destination sign options. In addition, the new Delta sound system was developed to provide improved sound throughout the cabin.\n\nFor the new EPA 2007 Standards, Prévost now offers an innovative installation of the Diesel Particulate Filter and the Rooftop Diffuser for Increased Safety, Performance, Serviceability and Security. The standard Detroit Diesel has been uprated from 12.7 litres to 14 litres for the model year 2007.\n\nFor the 2008 model year, Prévost introduced a new Volvo D13 engine from their parent company as a replacement for the then-current Detroit Diesel Series 60 offering. The Volvo I-Shift semiautomatic transmission was introduced as an option to the Allison B500R transmission. A set of new interior colour schemes were developed for the 2008 model year to provide a modern feel. There are three \"trim levels\" ranging from fabric to leather and wood.\n\nBeginning with 2011, the Prevost X3-45 is available in a transit configuration, with bi-fold doors instead of a sedan-type door. The New York City Transit Authority is the launch customer for this configuration. Previously, 20 transit-style buses in the LeMirage predecessor model had been built for GO Transit in the late 1990s.\n\nPrévost is also the North American builder of the Volvo 9700 motorcoach. \n\nDue to Coronavirus, Prevost announced to dismiss 300 workers in May 2020. \n\n\n\"Ground Force One\" is the nickname given to two heavily modified X3-45 VIP conversion coach owned by the United States Secret Service and used by the President of the United States and other high-ranking politicians or dignitaries. Prevost built the coach as a conversion shell, the Hemphill Brothers Coach Company fitted out the interiors of the coach, and it is assumed that other features, like armor plating, were added by the Secret Service.\n\n"}

Originally \"sakmow\" of the Kespukwitk district, he was appointed as Grand Chief by the \"sakmowk\" of the other six districts. He was born 1507 Mi 'Kmaq Nation Acadia. However, Membertou claimed to be a grown man when he first met Jacques Cartier, which would mean that he was probably born in the early years of the sixteenth century.\n\nHe was born 1507, died at the age of 104. Before becoming grand chief, Membertou had been the District Chief of Kespukwitk, a part of the Mi'kmaq nation which included the area where the French colonists settled Port-Royal. In addition to being \"sakmow\" or political leader, Membertou had also been the head \"autmoin\" or spiritual leader of his tribe — who believed him to have powers of healing and prophecy.\n\nMembertou was known to have acquired his own French shallop which he decorated with his own totems. He used this ship to trade with Europeans far out at sea, gaining first access to this important market and allowing him to sell goods at more worthwhile exchanges (\"forestalling the market\").\n\nMembertou became a good friend to the French. He first met the French when they arrived to build the Habitation at Port-Royal in 1605, at which time, according to the French lawyer and author Marc Lescarbot, he said he was over 100 and recalled meeting Jacques Cartier in 1534.\n\nBoth Lescarbot and explorer Samuel de Champlain wrote of having witnessed him conducting a funeral in 1606 for Panoniac, a fellow Mi'kmaw \"sakmow\" who had been killed by the Armouchiquois or Passamaquoddy tribe, of what is now Maine. Seeking revenge for this and similar acts of hostility, Membertou led 500 warriors in a raid on the Armouchiquois town, Chouacoet, present-day Saco, Maine, in July, 1607, killing 20 of their people, including two of their leaders, Onmechin and Marchin.\n\nHe is described by the Jesuit Pierre Biard as having maintained a beard, unlike other Mi'kmaq males who removed all facial hair. He was larger than the other males and despite his advanced age, had no grey or white hair. Also, unlike most \"sakmowk\" who were polygamous, Membertou had only one wife, who was baptised with the name of \"Marie\". Lescarbot records that the eldest son of Chief Membertou had the name Membertouchis (Membertouji'j, baptised Louis Membertou after the then-King of France, Louis XIII), while his second and third sons were called Actaudin (absent at the time of the baptism) and Actaudinech (Actaudinji'j, baptised Paul Membertou). He also had a daughter, given the name Marguerite.\n\nAfter building their fort, the French left in 1607, leaving only two of their party behind, during which time Membertou took good care of the fort and them, meeting them upon their return in 1610.\n\nThree songs of Membertou survive in written form, and provide the first music transcriptions from the Americas. The melodies for the songs were transcribed in solfège notation by Marc Lescarbot.\nThe time values of each note were recorded in an arrangement of Membertou's songs in mensural notation by Gabriel Sagard-Théodat.\n\nThe melodies use three notes of the solfege scale - originally transcribed as Re-Fa-Sol by Lescarbot, but more easily sung as La-Do-Re. Transcriptions of these songs are available for Native American flute.\n\nOn 24 June 1610 (Saint John the Baptist Day), Membertou became the first native leader to be baptised by the French, as a sign of alliance and good faith. The ceremony was carried out by priest Jessé Fléché, who went on to baptize all 21 members of Membertou's immediate family. It was then that Membertou was given the baptismal name \"Henri\", after the late king of France, Henry IV. Membertou's Baptism was part of the entry by the Mi'kmaq into a relationship with the Catholic Church, known as the Mi'kmaw Concordat.\n\nMembertou was very eager to become a proper Christian as soon as he was baptized. He wanted the missionaries to learn the Algonquian Mi'kmaq language so that he could be properly educated. Biard relates how, when Membertou's son Actaudin became gravely ill, he was prepared to sacrifice two or three dogs to precede him as messengers into the spirit world, but when Biard told him this was wrong, he did not, and Actaudin then recovered. However, in 1611, he contracted dysentery, one of the many infectious diseases spread in the New World by Europeans. By September 1611, he was very ill. Membertou insisted on being buried with his ancestors, something that bothered the missionaries. However; Membertou soon changed his mind and requested to be buried among the French. He died on 18 September 1611. In his final words, he charged his children to remain devout Christians.\n\nIn 2007 Canada Post issued a $0.52 stamp (domestic rate) in its \"French Settlement in North America\" series in honour of Chief Membertou.\n\n\n"}

The building was originally a Roman Catholic church erected in 1325 by the friars of the Dominican Order, near or above an earlier chapel dedicated to Saint Paul () in 1233. Although the structure was altered during the Ottoman period, it is the only example of medieval religious Gothic Architecture remaining in Istanbul.\n\nThe church was converted into a mosque by the Ottomans between 1475 and 1478, during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II, and became known as the Galata Mosque. It was later given by Sultan Bayezid II to Muslim Arab refugees from Al-Andalus who escaped the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 and settled in the Galata neighborhood of Istanbul (hence its current name, \"Arab Mosque\".)\n\nThe building lies in Istanbul's Beyoğlu district, in the neighborhood of Karaköy (medieval Galata), on \"Galata Mahkemesi Sokak\", not far from the northern shores of the Golden Horn. It is surrounded by artisan shops.\n\nDuring the 6th century, a Byzantine church, possibly dedicated to Saint Irene, was built here. Of this building, only part of a wall survives today.\n\nThe tradition which affirms that a mosque was built on this site during the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 717–18 by the Umayyad prince and general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik is a later, Ottoman-era legend. Ottoman chroniclers also confused the second Arab siege with the first Arab siege a generation before, and placed the construction of the mosque to around 686.\nIn 1233, during the Latin Empire of Constantinople (1204–1261) founded after the Fourth Crusade, this church was replaced with a small chapel, dedicated to Saint Paul (\"San Paolo\").\n\nIn 1299, the Dominican Friar Guillaume Bernard de Sévérac bought a house near the church, where he established a monastery with 12 friars. In 1307, Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos moved the Dominicans of Constantinople to the Genoese-held suburb of Pera.\n\nA new, much larger church was built near or above the chapel of San Paolo in 1325. Thereafter the church was officially dedicated to San Domenico, but local residents continued to use the ancient denomination. In 1407 Pope Gregory XII, in order to ensure the maintenance of the church, conceded indulgences to the visitors of the monastery of San Paolo.\n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople, according to the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire with the Republic of Genoa, the church, which by that time was known by the Turks under the name of \"Mesa Domenico\", remained in Genoese hands, but between 1475 and 1478 it was transformed, with minor modifications, into a mosque by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II and became known as Galata Camii (\"Galata Mosque\") or Cami-i Kebir (\"Great Mosque\"). The friars were transferred in the friary of San Pietro in Galata in 1476, while all the altar clothes had already been brought to Genoa, and the archives to Caffa.\n\nTowards the end of the century Sultan Bayezid II assigned the building to those Muslims of Spain (Andalusia) who had fled the Spanish Inquisition and migrated to Istanbul; hence the present name \"Arap Camii\" (Arab Mosque). Sultan Mehmet III repaired the building, and towards the end of seventeenth century the houses which encroached upon the mosque were pulled down in order to avoid noise.\n\nAfter the 1731 Great Fire of Galata, in 1734/35 the mother of Mahmut I, Saliha Sultan renovated the building, changing the windows and the portal from the Gothic to the Ottoman style. After another fire in 1808, in the mid-nineteenth century, the daughter of Mahmud II, Adile Sultan, repaired the mosque again and in 1868 built a \"şadirvan\" (fountain for ritual ablutions before praying) in the courtyard.\n\nBetween 1913 and 1919, Giridli Hasan Bey extensively restored the edifice again. During the replacement of the wooden floor, several Genoese tombstones dating back to between the first half of fourteenth and up to the middle of the fifteenth centuries were discovered. They were brought to the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2010s, the mosque underwent an extensive restoration, which was finished in 2013. An inaccurate inscription that the mosque was founded in 715 AD was also installed in front of the mosque as part of the restoration.\n\nErected according to the model of the Italian mendicant order churches of that period, the church had a three-nave rectangular base, with squared-off eastern end and a square sanctuary which is covered by ribbed groin vaults.\n\nThe Gothic-style portal, lancet windows and the prominent bell tower (which has been transformed into a minaret by the addition of a conical roof) distinguished the building from the Byzantine churches in the city. On the other side, the technique used for the brickwork was local, and alternated small courses of bricks and ashlar.\n\nThe NE nave was possibly flanked by a series of chapels, each of them belonging to a noble Genoese family. One of them was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and another to Saint Nicholas. As a whole, the building resembled the churches of Chieri and Finale Ligure in Italy.\n\nThe flat wooden roof and rather pretty wooden galleries date from the restoration in 1913-1919. On this occasion, the height of the building was lowered, and many Genoese headstones were found. During the same restorations, rests of paintings were also discovered near the Mihrab, but were covered again.\n\nIn the passage under the belfry, moldings are still visible, as well as fragments of stones with armorial bearings which were once placed along the wall. On the north side of the building there is a large and attractive courtyard with a \"şadırvan\".\n\nToday, Arap Camii is the largest mosque on the Galata side of the Golden Horn. It is one of the most interesting mosques in the city due to its early Italian Gothic architectural style and church belfry, which has practically remained unaltered even after being converted into a minaret.\n\n"}
{"id": "1810383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810383", "title": "Giovanni Papini", "text": "Giovanni Papini\n\nGiovanni Papini (9 January 18818 July 1956) was an Italian journalist, essayist, novelist, short story writer, poet, literary critic, and philosopher. Among the founders of the journals Leonardo (1903) and Lacerba (1913), he conceived literature as an \"action\" and gave his writings an oratory and irreverent tone. Though self-educated, he was considered influential iconoclastic editor and writer, leading in Italian futurism, he participated in the early literary movements of youth. A living part of the literary, foreign philosophical and political movements, such as the French intuitionism of Bergson and the Anglo-American pragmatism of Peirce and James, which at the beginning of the twentieth century promoted the aging of Italian culture and life from Florence, in the name of an individualistic and dreamy conception of life and art, and a spokesman in Roman Catholic religious belief. Papini's literary success began with his known works include \"Il Crepuscolo dei Filosofi\" (\"The Twilight of the Philosophers\"), published in 1906, and his 1913 publication of his auto-biographical novel \"Un Uomo Finito\" (\"A finished man\").\n\nPapini was born into a lower-middle-class family in Florence, the capital of Tuscany. Controversial and discussed intellectual, admired for his writing style, he was a scholar of philosophy, religion, literary critic and heated polemicist, narrator and poet, popularizer of pragmatism and historical avant-gardes such as futurism and post-decadentism. He went from one position to another on the fronts, always dissatisfied and uneasy, he converted from the anti-clericalism and atheism that turned catholicism on; went from cursing and convinced interventionism (before 1915) to aversion to war. \nIn the 1930s, after moving from individualism to conservatism, he finally joined fascism, while maintaining an aversion to nazism.\n\nAlmost removed from the great literature after its disappearance mainly due to its ideological choices, it was later appreciated and re-evaluated; in 1975, the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges called him an \"undeservedly forgotten\" author.\n\nBorn in Florence as the son of a modest furniture retailer (and former member of Giuseppe Garibaldi's Redshirts) from Borgo degli Albizi, Papini's mother baptized Papini secretly to avoid the aggressive anti-clericalism of his father. Papini lived a rustic, lonesome childhood. At that time he had felt a strong aversion to all beliefs, to all churches, as well as to any form of servitude (which he saw as connected to religion); he also became enchanted with the idea of writing an encyclopedia wherein all cultures would be summarized.\n\nTrained at the \"Istituto di Studi Superiori\" (1900–2), he taught for a year in the Anglo-Italian school and then was librarian at the Museum of Anthropology from 1902 to 1904. The literary life attracted Papini, who in 1903 founded the magazine \"Il Leonardo\", to which he contributed articles under the pseudonym of \"Gian Falco.\" His collaborators included Giuseppe Prezzolini, Borgese, Vailati, Costetti and Calderoni. Through Leonardo's Papini and his contributors introduced in Italy important thinkers such as Kierkegaard, Peirce, Nietzsche, Santayana and Poincaré. He would later join the staff of \"Il Regno\", a nationalist publication directed by Enrico Corradini, who formed the \"Associazione Nazionalistica Italiana\", to support his country colonial expansionism.\n\nPapini met William James and Henri Bergson, who greatly influenced his early works. He started publishing short-stories and essays: in 1906, \"Il Tragico Quotidiano\" (\"Everyday Tragic\"), in 1907 \"Il Pilota Cieco\" (\"The Blind Pilot\") and \"Il Crepuscolo dei Filosofi\" (\"The Twilight of the Philosophers\"). The latter constituted a polemic with established and diverse intellectual figures, such as Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Papini proclaimed the death of philosophers and the demolition of thinking itself. He briefly flirted with Futurism and other violent and liberating forms of Modernism (Papini is the character in several poems of the period written by Mina Loy).\n\nIn 1907 Papini married Giacinta Giovagnoli; the couple had two daughters, Viola and Gioconda.\n\nAfter leaving \"Il Leonardo\" in 1907, Giovanni Papini founded several other magazines. First he published \"La Voce\" in 1908, then \"L'Anima\" together with Giovanni Amendola and Prezzolini. In 1913 (right before Italy's entry into World War I) he started \"Lacerba\" (1913–15). From three years Papini was correspondent for the \"Mercure de France\" and later literary critic for \"La Nazione\". About 1918 he created yet another review, \"La Vraie Italie\", with Ardengo Soffici.\n\nOther books came from his pen. His \"Parole e Sangue\" (\"Words and Blood\") showed his fundamental atheism. Furthermore, Papini sought to create scandal by speculating that Jesus and John the Apostle had a homosexual relationship. In 1912 he published his best-known work, the autobiography \"Un Uomo Finito\" (\"The Failure\").\n\nIn his 1915 collection of poetic prose \"Cento Pagine di Poesia\" (followed by \"Buffonate\", \"Maschilità\", and \"Stroncature\"), Papini placed himself face-to-face with Giovanni Boccaccio, William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but also contemporaries such as Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile, and less prominent disciples of Gabriele D'Annunzio. A critic wrote of him:\n\nGiovanni Papini [...] is one of the finest minds in the Italy of today. He is an excellent representative of modernity's restless search for truth, and his work exhibits a refreshing independence founded, not like so much so-called independence, upon ignorance of the past, but upon a study and understanding of it.\n\nHe published verse in 1917, grouped under the title \"Opera Prima\". In 1921, Papini announced his newly found Roman Catholicism, publishing his \"Storia di Cristo\" (\"The Story of Christ\"), a book which has been translated into twenty-three languages and has had a worldwide success.\n\nAfter further verse works, he published the satire \"Gog\" (1931) and the essay \"Dante Vivo\" (\"Living Dante\", or \"If Dante Were Alive\"; 1933).\nHe became a teacher at the University of Bologna in 1935, when the Fascist authorities confirmed Papini's \"\"impeccable reputation\"\" through the appointment. In 1937, Papini published the only volume of his \"History of Italian Literature\", which he dedicated to Benito Mussolini: \"\"to Il Duce, friend of poetry and of the poets\"\", being awarded top positions in academia, especially in the study of Italian Renaissance. In 1940 Papini's \"Storia della Letteratura Italiana\" was published in Nazi Germany with the title \"Eternal Italy – The Great in its Empire of Letters\" (in German: Ewiges Italien – Die Großen im Reich seiner Dichtung). Papini was the vice president of the \"Europäische Schriftstellervereinigung\" (i.e. \"European Writers' League\"), which was founded by Joseph Goebbels in 1941/42. When the Fascist regime crumbled (1943), Papini entered the Franciscan convent in La Verna, with the name Fra' Bonaventura.\n\nLargely discredited at the end of World War II, he was defended by the Catholic political right. His work concentrated on different subjects, including a biography of Michelangelo, while he continued to publish dark and tragic essays. He collaborated with \"Corriere della Sera\", contributing articles that were published as a volume after his death.\n\nPapini had been suffering from progressive paralysis (due by motor neuron disease) and was blind during the last years of his life.\n\nAccording to art historian Richard Dorment, Francisco Franco's regime and NATO used Papini's series of imaginary interviews (\"Il Libro Nero\", 1951) as propaganda against Pablo Picasso, to dramatically undercut his pro-Communist image. In 1962, the artist asked his biographer Pierre Daix, to expose the pretend interview, which he did in \"Les Lettres Françaises\".\n\nHe was admired by Bruno de Finetti, founder of a subjective theory of probability and Jorge Luis Borges, who remarked that Papini had been \"unjustly forgotten\" and included some of his stories in the Library of Babel.\n\n\nPosthumous\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ammunition was based on the 40x158R cartridge case of the naval 2 pdr Anti-aircraft gun (the \"Pom-pom\"). The weapon was a long-recoil design derived from the 37 mm 1½pdr \"COW gun\" from Coventry Ordnance Works.The gun was originally intended as a bomber defensive weapon and was tested as such in a turret fitted to a modified Vickers Wellington II. This was not adopted for service, but when the need to attack tanks from the air was identified, the \"S\" gun was chosen and special armour-piercing ammunition developed.\n\nThe only aircraft built to carry the Vickers S were ground attack variants of the Hawker Hurricane. Mark IID and Mark IV Hurricanes could mount one under each wing, in conformal gun pods.\n\nNo. 6 Squadron RAF operated the Hurricane IID in North Africa from mid-1942. Claims by pilots using the Vickers S included 47 tanks destroyed (of 148 tanks hit), as well as nearly 200 other vehicles. However, the Hurricane IID was poorly armoured for the ground attack role and ground fire caused heavy losses. In addition, 40 mm ammunition was seldom effective against vehicles as well-armoured as the Tiger I tank.\n\nMark IV Hurricanes (operational from 1943) had improved armour around their engine, cockpit and fuel tanks.\n\nFrom 1944, Hurricanes armed with the Vickers S served in the South East Asian theatre. In most cases HE ammunition was used against road vehicles and river craft.\n\nAssessments carried out in South East Asia showed a relatively high level of accuracy: an average of 25% of shots fired at tanks hit their target. (By comparison, RP-3 60 pound rocket projectiles only 5% against tank-sized targets.) However, 40 mm HE rounds were twice as accurate as AP rounds, possibly because the lighter weight and higher velocity of the HE round gave it ballistics similar to that of the .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine gun that were used for sighting.\n\n\n\n"}

Located in Arcavacata, a hamlet of Rende in the Province of Cosenza, the university was founded in 1972. Among its founders there were Beniamino Andreatta, Giorgio Gagliani, Pietro Bucci and Paolo Sylos Labini.\nIt currently has about 35,000 students, 800 teaching and research staff and about 700 administrative staff.\n\nThe Campus of the University of Calabria was originally designed by Vittorio Gregotti and Dänen Martensson. \nThe buildings are situated along a suspension bridge, which is currently 1.3 kilometres long. As in British and North-American campuses, students live in specific residential blocks near the University. \nThe whole structure is swathed in greenery of hills near Arcavacata, a small village at 10 km from Cosenza, and 4 km from the city center of Rende.\n\nThe University is organized in the following departments:\n\nSince its very beginning the University of Calabria has clearly set out the strategies for the development of its international dimension. In the past twenty years several bilateral agreements were established by the University of Calabria with European and other foreign universities. Such agreements aim at encouraging cooperation in the fields of research and didactic activities. Emphasis to international relationships among higher education institutions was provided by the launching of European programmes such as ERASMUS, in the 80s, which paved the way to student mobility activities. In particular, double level degrees were created as a relevant didactic offer to students participating in these exchanges. Among these we can mention the conventions established by the Faculty of Economics with the Manchester Metropolitan University (UK) and with the University of Applied Sciences Fachhochschule Bochum (Germany), and by the Faculty of Political Science with the Universidad de Jaen (Spain).\n\nApart from the participation in programmes co-financed by the E.U., the University of Calabria has established contacts with international organisations such as FAO, UNESCO of the United Nations, and OECD. Internationalisation will be further implemented through other trans-national research and didactic projects as a form of mission embedded by the University of Calabria. As an interesting outcome to these mobility experiences, international students who live and study on a permanent basis on campus created a small but lively community. Currently a special program for foreign postgraduate students is being implemented.\n\nThe Unical reparto corse is a project of The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Management and Energy (DIMEG) that started in 2005. The group involves students and professors applying the knowledge gained in their studies to develop race cars that compete in European races.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1810414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810414", "title": "Milecastle", "text": "Milecastle\n\nA milecastle was a small fort (fortlet), a rectangular fortification built during the period of the Roman Empire. They were placed at intervals of approximately one Roman mile along several major frontiers, for example Hadrian's Wall in Great Britain (Britannia in the Roman period), hence the name.\n\nAlong Hadrian's Wall, milecastles were initially constructed of stone in the eastern two thirds, and stacked turf with a wooden palisade in the western third, though the turf milecastles were later rebuilt in stone. Size varied, but in general they were about 15m by 18m (16 by 20 yards) internally, with stone walls as much as 3m (10 feet) thick and probably 5m to 6m (17 to 20 feet) high, to match the height of the adjacent wall. There were 80 milecastles and 158 turrets.\n\nOn Hadrian's Wall, a milecastle (there are a few exceptions) guarded a gateway through the Wall with a corresponding causeway across the Wall ditch to the north, and had a garrison of perhaps 20–30 auxiliary soldiers housed in two barrack blocks. On either side of the milecastle was a stone tower (turret), located about one-third of a Roman mile (500m or 540 yards) away. It is assumed that the garrison also supplied soldiers to man the turrets. The milecastle's garrison controlled the passage of people, goods and livestock across the frontier, and it is likely that the milecastle acted as a customs post to levy taxation on that traffic.\n\nA system of milecastles (known as milefortlets) and intervening stone watchtowers extended from the western end of Hadrian's Wall, along the Cumbrian coast as far as Tower 25B at Flimby, but they were linked by a wooden palisade and not a wall fronted by a deep ditch, and they had no gateway through the palisade.\n\nThe term \"milecastle\" was formalised by Robert Smith in 1708, but was in informal use by locals before that date. It generally refers to the installations attached to the curtain wall, with the term 'Milefortlet' being widely used to refer to similar installations that continued along the Cumbrian coast and were contemporary with the Milecastles. Turrets standing between milefortlets are referred to as towers.\n\nMilecastles are numbered from 1 (the easternmost Milecastle) to 80 in the West. This system was introduced by J. Collingwood Bruce at the end of the 19th century, and became a standard around 1930, though Peter Hill has suggested that there may have additionally been a Milecastle 0. Milefortlets are numbered from 1 (West of Bowness on Solway) possibly as far as 26 (at Flimby). The widely used shorthand is, for example, 'MC1', 'MC2', etc. for Milecastles and 'MF1', 'MF2', etc. for Milefortlets. Intervening Turrets and Towers are referred to with an alphabetic suffix, so the turrets to the West of MC20 would be Turrets 20a and 20b, or 'T20a' and 'T20b'. Despite evidence of the curtain wall continuing for around a quarter of a mile west of Bowness-on-Solway, the Turrets between MC80 and MF1 are known as Towers 0a and 0b.\n\nWhere the Turf Wall and Stone Walls diverge from one another (just to the west of Birdoswald), Milecastles and Turrets unique to the Turf Wall are given a 'TW' suffix, for example 'MC50 TW'.\n\nThe milecastles of Hadrian's Wall are recognised as having three principal types of gateway.\n\nType I have piers protruding symmetrically on the inside and outside of the gateway, with responds on both the inside and outside. The piers and passage-walls tend to be in large masonry, and the structure is broader (E to W) than it is deep (N to S, i.e. between the gateways). Examples are MC 38 (Hotbank) and MC 42 (Cawfields). Generally thought to have been built by Legio II Augusta.\n\nType II have piers protruding on the inside of the gateway, with responds on outside. The piers and passage-walls tend to be in smaller masonry than Type I. Only found on Narrow Wall milecastles; when similar gateways are found on Broad Wall milecastles, it is sometimes referred to as Type IV. An example is MC 9 (Chapel House). Generally thought to have been built by Legio XX Valeria Victrix.\n\nType III have piers protruding on the inside of the gateway, with responds on both the inside and outside. The piers tend to be in large masonry and the passage-walls in smaller material. Examples are MC 47 (Chapel House, E of Gilsland) and MC 48 (Poltross Burn). Generally thought to have been built by Legio VI Victrix.\n\nTwo types of milecastle are discernible in plan. These are known as 'Long Axis' and 'Short Axis', with the referred axis being that between the northern and southern gateways. The only (known) exception is Milecastle 79, which was a Turf Wall milecastle subsequently rebuilt with stone.\n\nThe following are example impressions of what a milecastle might have looked like, created in Google SketchUp and modeled around Housesteads Milecastle (Milecastle 37).\n\nThe Sketchup file is available at (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=97274e6b66c697cabd1b68f4d1016153&prevstart=0)\n"}

According to the 2007 census, the population of the district was 25,169, of which 9,831 lived in the city of Şile, 2,096 in the nearby town of Ağva (Yeşilçay) and 13,242 in surrounding villages. However, between June and September, the population rapidly increases because of the many residents of Istanbul who have summer houses in Şile.\n\nThe district of Şile is part of the province () of Istanbul, and the municipality of Şile is part of the metropolitan government () of Istanbul. Bordering Şile is the province of Kocaeli (districts of Gebze, Körfez, Derince, Kandıra) to the east and south, and Istanbul districts of Pendik to the south, Çekmeköy to the southwest, and Beykoz to the west. The boundaries of Şile were expanded by the addition of the village of Esenceli from Beykoz district in 1987. Şile consists of Şile, Yeşilvadi and Teke subdistricts, and 58 villages. The mayor is Can Tabakoğlu (AKP). Popular resort Ağva is also a part of Şile. \n\nThe word \"şile\" means marjoram in Turkish. The word's etymology is said to be Greek.\n\nThere has been a fishing village here since 700 BC and a lighthouse since the Ottoman period. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Şile had a total population of 16.770, consisting of 10.314 Muslims, 6.447 Greeks, 3 Armenians and 6 foreign citizens.\n\nToday, Şile is a beach resort, popular with people who want a resort atmosphere without the expense of travelling to the Mediterranean Sea. Şile is about an hour's drive from the city and was always a retreat from the city. During Turkey's economic boom of the 1990s, a great many summer homes and holiday villages were built for the city's middle class, especially after the 1999 earthquake damaged the Marmara coast. There is a small but sandy beach, a little harbour of fishing boats, dense forest behind and a quiet pleasant atmosphere during the week. At weekends though, and especially on a hot summer Sunday, Şile is crowded with day-trippers from the poorer districts of the city, who come packed into minibuses and vans to picnic and play football. There are a number of bars and restaurants with sea views, especially in the little park around the lighthouse.\n\nŞile is famous for its beaches. However, it is at the northernmost point of Istanbul and thus shares the same sea conditions as other Black Sea towns where strong sea undercurrents can be dangerous to inexperienced swimmers. Beachgoers drown here annually on a regular basis. The north-facing Black Sea has a much shorter holiday season than the Aegean, the Mediterranean or even the Marmara, due to the cold winters.\n\nŞile Castle () is a 14th-century Genoese castle on an island in Şile. The castle was renovated in 2015, sparking criticism that the work had made it resemble the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants or an illustration from the video game \"Minecraft\".\n\nThe tomb of a Muslim saint, Kum Baba, is on a tree-covered hill above Şile. Along the coast near Şile, in the village of Kızılcaköy, is a cave which, according to a local myth, is said to be the scene of events in the Anabasis of Xenophon.\n\nŞile is also known for Şile cloth, a crimped-looking, light, see-through cotton fabric, made on the Şile coast, sold in many shops in the town and sent to the bazaars of Istanbul. A fair is held in the town to promote Şile cloth every summer.\n\nThe largest campus of Işık University is located in Şile.\n\nŞile is a part of Istanbul public transport system (İETT). There is a bus from Harem via Üsküdar (located at the Anatolian side of Istanbul) to Şile (İETT Lines 139 and 139A).\n\nŞile is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Its construction was started in 1844 and prisoners first entered the gaol in 1848. By the time of its closure, on 31 January 1998, it had become the longest continuously-run gaol in Australia. It has since been turned into a museum and is a popular tourist attraction. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nThe gaol is in East Maitland, and this location was first used as a gaol in 1843; in the same year two prisoners were hanged there for the murder of a child. Permanent buildings were not begun until 1846 (though a foundation stone was laid in 1844), and the official opening was in December 1848. The first stage included the south-east wing, the gate lodges and the enclosing wall of the original compound, all of stone. The second stage, built 1861-73 under James Barnet, included the north-west wing, the watch towers, the warders' quarters and the governor's residence that flanked the entrance from John Street, the two storey building that contained a chapel and a school room on the first floor and workshops on the ground floor.\n\nFlogging was in place whilst the gaol was being built. Executions were open to the public until 1861, and crowds were common. Hangings took place at the main gates and the back corner of the gaol. Sixteen men were executed at Maitland Gaol between 1849 and 1897 – all for rape or murder. There is still debate as to where some of these executions took place throughout the gaol. The last man executed at Maitland was Charles Hines in May 1897 for allegedly raping his stepdaughter; however, he claimed he was innocent until he took his last breath. In New South Wales, the last corporal punishment occurred at the Maitland Gaol – a whipping, in 1905.\n\nConstruction on the eastern extension was completed in 1900. Work included perimeter walls, watch towers, women's cell range, workshops and female warders quarters.\n\nMaitland became a maximum-security prison in 1972.\n\nIn 1975 inmates rioted, setting fire to the maintenance block. They used a swag of homemade weapons to attack the prison wardens, protesting about the prison system and the gaol's conditions. The infamous Darcy Dugan was blamed for inciting the riot, while 78 of the rioting inmates were transferred to other prisons. Damage resulting from the riot was estimated at .\n\nIn 1977, Raymond Denning and six others escaped through an exhaust vent in the shower block. They were all back inside in two hours after a massive police sweep on the area.\n\nIn 1978, a 23-year-old inmate protested for 16 hours by sitting on top of the gaol's administration building. At one stage he disappeared over the roof returning with food. Armed with a softwood stake, he waved to television and \"Maitland Mercury\" newspaper journalists.\n\nA long tunnel was discovered in Cell 7 in C Wing in 1980. The man who informed the warden of the tunnel had his throat cut so viciously his head swung back on his shoulders. His body was hidden with a sheet of plastic painted the same colour as the floor. The tunnel was filled in with two truckloads of concrete. There were many other escape attempts but most failed; of 32 attempted escapees, 31 were recaptured.\n\nIn 1993, a block of modern prison cells was built above the kitchens, designed to house only the prisoners who worked in the kitchens. These cells were designed to house, usually, only one inmate at a time. Only trusted inmates who showed good behaviour and had cooking skills worked in the kitchens.\n\nAlso built in 1993, 5-wing was a high-security cell block designed to house inmates who had committed heinous crimes or crimes against other inmates. 5-wing inmates had no contact with anyone at all. These inmates had their own exercise yards, which contained a shower. They were allowed in there for only one hour per day. This was the last cell block to be built before the gaol's closure in 1998. In this cell block was also a clinic designed to treat inmates who had swallowed razor blades or drugs.\n\nIn April 1996, state Minister for Corrective Services Bob Debus announced the closure of Maitland Gaol as part of an overhaul of the NSW prison system, as its accommodation and working conditions were no longer considered appropriate in the context of the Government's plans for correctional facilities.\n\nIn 1997, George Savvas and Ivan Milat had planned an escape from the gaol but were stopped by correctional officers. The day after the escape was planned for, Savvas was found dead in his cell after hanging himself. He and Milat were housed in the 5-wing cell block.\n\nThe gaol closed in January 1998. Maitland City Council was offered a 50-year lease in February 1999.\n\nThe Maitland Gaol complex is positioned on top of the main hill at East Maitland. It is the focal point of the town and an important confirmation of the axial town planning concept of the Surveyor General of that time, Sir Thomas Mitchell.\n\nMade mainly of sandstone and metal roofing, the building structures are set out on the same north-west bearing as the predominant street pattern of East Maitland. The cell block Wings \"A\" and \"B\" were located symmetrically about the Gate House axis in the 1840s being of equal distance from the axis.\n\nThe houses of the Governor of the Jail and of the Lieutenant-Governor project forwards from the gaol wall to form a court, with the main entrance at the far end.\n\nThe newer extension on the western side is of red coloured brick.\n\nOn 2 April 1999 the Maitland Correctional Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following statement of significance:\n\n\nVisitors can take a self-guided audio tour of the historic prison or can take guided theme tours.\n\nThe \"Australian Museum of Clothing and Textiles\" is located in the Maitland Gaol and features clothing and accessories, textiles and related items.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS, as part of a duopoly with independent station KTXA (channel 21), also licensed to Fort Worth. The two stations share primary studio facilities on Bridge Street (off I-30), east of downtown Fort Worth; KTVT operates a secondary studio and newsroom—which also houses advertising sales offices for both stations, as well as the Dallas bureau for CBS News—at the CBS Tower on North Central Expressway and Coit Road (north of NorthPark Center) in Dallas. KTVT's transmitter is located on Tar Road in Cedar Hill, just south of the Dallas–Ellis county line.\n\nThe allocation originally assigned to VHF channel 10 was contested between three groups that competed for approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to be the holder of the construction permit to build and license to operate a new television station on the second commercial VHF allocation to be assigned to Fort Worth. Lechner Television Co. – owned by oil and gas exploration and production entrepreneur Walter W. Lechner – filed the initial permit application on July 3, 1952. One week later on July 11, the Texas State Network – a broadcasting consortium owned by Sid W. Richardson (philanthropist and owner of, among other petroleum firms in the state, Fort Worth-based Sid W. Richardson Inc. and Richardson and Bass Oil Producers), media executive Gene L. Cagle, mineral rights firm owner R. K. Hanger, company president Charles B. Jordan and D. C. Homburg – filed a separate license application. The Fort Worth Television Co. – a group led by several oilmen including Raymond O. Shaffer (president and chairman of Fort Worth-based Welex Jet and part-owner of the Texas Rail Joint Co. and oil well drilling firm Monarch Manufacturing Co.), Sterling C. Holloway (a Fort Worth attorney and president/director of Continental Life Insurance Co.); M. J. Neeley (president and majority stockholder of Fort Worth-based trailer manufacturing firm Hobbs Manufacturing Co.), Arch Rowan (chairman of Fort Worth oil well drilling firm Rowan Drilling Co., and president and minority owner of local oil production firm Rowan Oil Co.) and F. Kirk Johnson (oil and gas lease purchaser and royalty collector), along with O. P. Newberry (vice president of Fort Worth National Bank) – became the third applicant for the license on December 11, 1952.\n\nOn September 3, 1953, in an approval of proposals submitted by John F. Easley (founding owner of KVSO-TV [now KXII<nowiki>]</nowiki> in Ada) and Eastern TV Corp. (founding owner of KTEN in Ada, Oklahoma) to realign the two VHF channel assignments to alleviate interference issues with their proposed stations, the FCC amended its \"Sixth Report and Order\" assignment table to reassign channel 10 to Waco (later occupied by CBS affiliate KWTX-TV) and move the VHF channel 11 allocation to Fort Worth. All three applicants subsequently amended their license applications to seek assignment on channel 11 instead. The FCC granted the permit to the Texas State Network – now owned by Entercom by way of CBS Radio's 2017 sale of its radio station properties – on September 17, 1954, after the agency formally dismissed the applications by Lechner and the Fort Worth Television Co. The Sid Richardson-led group chose to assign KFJZ-TV as the call letters for its television station, using the base callsign that had been used by its existing radio station on 1270 AM (now KFLC; the call letters now reside on an unrelated, Fort Worth-based radio station on 870 AM) since it signed on in 1924.\n\nChannel 11, as KFJZ-TV, first signed on the air at 2:30 p.m. on September 11, 1955, after a launch ceremony culminating in Fort Worth oilman Sid Richardson flipping the ceremonial switch to activate the transmitter. It was the first independent station to sign on in Texas, the fourth television station to sign on in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex (after NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (channel 5, now KXAS-TV), which signed on the air on September 29, 1948; ABC affiliate KBTV (channel 8, now WFAA), which debuted on September 17, 1949; and CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (channel 4, now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW), which debuted on December 3, 1949), and the first to debut in the market since the FCC's 1952 lifting of a four-year freeze on new applications for television station licenses. Originally, Channel 11 maintained a 9½-hour per day programming schedule, starting with its sign-on at 2:30 p.m. and concluding at its midnight sign-off. The station originally operated from facilities at 4801 West Freeway (in the present-day location of Interstate 30) in Fort Worth.\n\nIn 1957, KFJZ-TV moved its transmitter facilities to a tower at the antenna farm in Cedar Hill, which provided a signal that covered the Dallas–Fort Worth market. The transmitter relocation played a major factor in throwing Channel 11 into a three-station competition for the NBC affiliation. The network had been affiliated with WBAP-TV since it signed on nine years earlier; however, the heirs of \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" founder Amon G. Carter chose to continue his legacy of civic boosterism of Fort Worth by refusing to move WBAP's transmitter facilities from eastern Fort Worth to an area between both cities. The lack of adequate reception throughout the entire Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area led NBC to simultaneously maintain an affiliation with WFAA beginning in 1950 to act as its Dallas affiliate. (Despite their close proximity, Arbitron originally designated Dallas and Fort Worth as separate markets: the Dallas market as Dallas County and surrounding counties in the area's eastern half and the Fort Worth market as neighboring Tarrant County and the counties surrounding it in the west. The two cities would be consolidated into a single television market in 1952.)\n\nThe split-station arrangement frustrated NBC to the point where in early 1957, it threatened to terminate its affiliation contract with WBAP-TV if it did not agree to move its transmitter eastward to provide a signal that covered Dallas \"and\" Fort Worth. WFAA's corporate parent A.H. Belo first approached the network with an offer to become the Metroplex's exclusive NBC affiliate. The Roosevelts also submitted an offer to move the network's programming to KFJZ-TV. Neither station won out, as the Carter heirs would reluctantly agree to NBC's demands to retain the affiliation and move the WBAP-TV transmitter to an existing candelabra tower shared by WFAA and KRLD-TV, operating it at a higher effective radiated power strong enough to adequately cover central and eastern Dallas County and adjacent areas that had only rimshot signal coverage of the station. WBAP-TV became the exclusive NBC affiliate for the entire Dallas–Fort Worth market on September 1, 1957, with WFAA remaining an ABC affiliate; Channel 11, meanwhile, continued as an independent station, filling its schedule with syndicated and locally produced programs. During the late 1950s, KFJZ-TV briefly maintained an affiliation with the NTA Film Network.\n\nIn 1959, the Roosevelts gave KFJZ-TV and KFJZ (AM) an FM radio sister, when it signed on KFJZ-FM (97.1, now KEGL). In May 1960, the Texas State Network sold Channel 11 to the NAFI Telecasting Corporation (which was also the parent company of Chris-Craft Industries at the time) for $4 million; the two radio stations were not included in the transaction, which was completed on August 1 of that year. Subsequently, the station's call letters were changed to KTVT (the last three letters meaning \"TeleVision for Texans\") on September 1; the change was made due to an FCC rule in effect at the time that prohibited separately owned broadcast stations in the same market from sharing the same base call letters.\n\nOn February 23, 1962, NAFI Telecasting sold KTVT for $4 million to the WKY Television System subsidiary of the Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO), then owned by the family of \"Daily Oklahoman\" founder Edward K. Gaylord, who originally named the unit after its flagship television and radio stations—WKY-TV (now KFOR-TV) and WKY (AM)—in the company's headquarters of Oklahoma City. The transaction made KTVT the largest television station by market size to be owned by the media company, which OPUBCO would later rename Gaylord Broadcasting. Under the stewardship of Gaylord and James R. Terrell, whom the company appointed as the station's vice president and general manager, Channel 11 became the leading independent station in the Southwestern United States; at the time, it carried a broad range of cartoons, off-network sitcoms, Westerns and drama series, movies and public affairs programming.\n\nIn July 1966, KTVT began broadcasting its programming in color, after the station acquired camera, projection and slide equipment to broadcast local and acquired programming in the format; KTVT inaugurated its color telecasts with the station's broadcast of the Miss Texas Pageant, its first local program to be produced in the format.\n\nLike Gaylord's other independent stations, KTVT's programming was mainly aimed at rural and suburban residents in the Metroplex's outer portions. Channel 11 was further aided in its status as it was a VHF station, whereas its future competitors would transmit on the UHF band. KTVT gained its first major competitor in February 1968, when Doubleday Broadcasting signed on KMEC (channel 39), which featured a broad mix of general entertainment and sports programs. The Christian Broadcasting Network entered into the mix in January 1973, when it launched KXTX-TV (channel 33), with a schedule that featured a mix of family-oriented secular programs and religious programs. However, the former of the two would struggle, leading Doubleday to donate the UHF channel 39 license (by then, assigned the KDTV call letters) to CBN in exchange for acquiring KXTX's license for UHF channel 33; while KXTX continued to grow after the call sign and intellectual unit were transferred to Channel 39 (now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station) in November 1973, KDTV could not compete with either KXTX nor KTVT and shut down nine weeks later.\n\nKTVT's popularity also spread outside of the Metroplex beginning in the late 1970s, when the station began making its signal available to cable television providers throughout Texas and in surrounding states. This attained it a new status as a superstation along the lines of WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta, WGN-TV in Chicago and WOR-TV in New York City (now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV and licensed to Secaucus, New Jersey); its signal was transmitted to about 400 cable systems and to C-band satellite subscribers across the country, mainly in the Southwestern U.S. At its height, the station was available on nearly every cable provider in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as large swaths of Louisiana, Arkansas and New Mexico.\n\nKTVT remained the Dallas–Fort Worth market's leading independent station into the 1980s, even as it gained three additional UHF independent competitors launched over the course of six months in the early 1980s. National Business Network Inc. returned channel 33 to the air as KNBN-TV (now CW affiliate KDAF) on September 29, 1980; however, that station did not begin to make any real headway against KTVT in the ratings during its tenure under local ownership. KTVT gained a fourth independent competitor six days later on October 6, when Grant Broadcasting signed on KTXA (channel 21, then licensed to Arlington). A fifth competitor arrived on January 26, 1981, when Liberty Television signed on KTWS-TV (channel 27, now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station KDFI). KTVT and KXTX—the latter of which had also expanded into a regional superstation around this time—went head to head to achieve status as the strongest independent station in North Texas, with its three younger competitors lagging behind, and were the only independents in the market that were able to turn a profit.\n\nOn July 1, 1984, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based United Video Satellite Group—which already distributed fellow independent WGN-TV in Chicago and planned to uplink its New York City sister station WPIX via satellite as national superstations—uplinked the KTVT signal to the Satcom IV satellite (later relocated to the Spacenet III in December 1988) for distribution to cable and satellite subscribers throughout the Southwestern United States, in a move by Gaylord to persuade the providers that imported the station's signal by microwave relay to begin transmitting KTVT by satellite. For about six years afterward, the KTVT satellite signal carried the same programming schedule as that seen in the Metroplex. In addition to being available via cable, this signal was also distributed directly to satellite dish owners. Around that time, KTVT further cemented this status by referencing the station in continuity as \"Channel 11, The Super Ones\".\n\nKTVT was one of the few long-tenured major market independents that did not align with the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company in the run-up to the network's launch in October 1986. It, however, was eliminated from contention in becoming a Fox station from the start, as network parent News Corporation had purchased KRLD-TV (the former KNBN-TV, which would become KDAF) as part of its merger with Metromedia in May 1985, six months prior to the Rupert Murdoch-owned media company's announcement of the formation of the Fox network. KDAF and the other five former Metromedia stations served as the nuclei for the new network as the original members of the Fox Television Stations, its group of owned-and-operated stations. However, even without the presence of KDAF, KTVT would have likely passed on the Fox affiliation in any event. Most of the smaller markets that were within KTVT's vast cable footprint—with the minor exceptions of areas such as the adjacent Ada–Sherman and, until former CBS affiliate KLMG-TV [now KFXK-TV] switched to the network in 1991, Tyler–Longview–Nacogdoches markets—had enough commercial television stations to allow Fox to maintain an exclusive affiliation, meaning that it would have made little sense to have the station relay the network's programming to multiple markets located beyond the reach of its broadcast signal. In the late 1980s, the station relocated its operations to its current facility at 5233 Bridge Street, as a construction project that would widen the West Freeway into a four-lane highway forced KTVT to move from its original studios, which were torn down to make way for the additional freeway lanes.\n\nAs KTVT gained regional exposure, the station became vulnerable in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and underestimated the ability of UHF competitor KTXA to acquire top-rated syndicated programs. Out of the companies that owned the market's independents, the group that owned KTXA at the time, Grant Broadcasting, was particularly aggressive in its programming acquisitions by leveraging its independent stations elsewhere around the country for the strongest programs that were entering into syndication; as a result, Grant-owned KTXA edged ahead of KTVT in the ratings by the fall of 1984. Not to stay outdone, after Gaylord appointed KSTW general manager Charles L. Edwards as KTVT's executive vice president and general manager (as well as the group's corporate programming director) in 1984, the station began making its own moves in acquiring stronger first-run and off-network syndicated programming, gaining the rights to series such as \"The Cosby Show\", \"Night Court\" and \"Cheers\". The station's ratings improved under the stewardship of Edwards, resulting in KTVT retaking its status as the top-rated independent station in the market by the time of his retirement in 1989.\n\nOn May 19, 1988, the FCC passed the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule (or \"SyndEx\"), a law that required cable television providers to black out syndicated programs aired on any out-of-market stations carried on their systems (either stations from nearby markets serving as default network affiliates or superstations), if a television station has obtained the exclusive rights to air a particular program in a given market. Gaylord was not willing to create a dedicated feed that included substitute programs that would replace shows aired on KTVT locally in certain time slots that could not air outside of its primary viewing area due to market exclusivity claims by various stations (as WGN-TV and WWOR-TV did at the time the law became official); as such, when the law went into effect on January 1, 1990, cable providers in some areas throughout the South Central U.S. chose to drop KTVT from their lineups.\n\nIn December 1993, Gaylord engaged in discussions with Time Warner on a potential agreement to affiliate KTVT and sister independent stations KHTV (now CW affiliate KIAH) in Houston, WVTV (now a CW affiliate) in Milwaukee and KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station) in the Seattle–Tacoma area into charter affiliates of The WB, a network announced one month earlier on November 2 and founded as a venture between Time Warner's Warner Bros. Television unit and the Tribune Company, which was one of two television networks originally proposed to launch in the fall of 1994—along with the United Paramount Network (UPN)—created to target the younger-skewing audiences courted by Fox and, to a lesser extent, to compete with ABC, NBC and CBS. (The network's launch would later be pushed back to January 1995.) Gaylord had not yet signed the proposed agreement when another planned affiliation transaction took place that resulted in the shift of two existing networks from their longtime station partners\n\nOn May 23, 1994, as part of a broad deal that also saw News Corporation acquire a 20% equity interest in the company, New World Communications signed a long-term agreement to affiliate its nine CBS-, ABC- or NBC-affiliated television stations with Fox, which sought to strengthen its affiliate portfolio after the National Football League (NFL) accepted the network's $1.58 billion bid for the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC)—a four-year contract that began with the 1994 NFL season—on December 18, 1993. At the time, Fox's owned-and-operated and affiliate stations were mostly UHF outlets that had limited to no prior history as major network affiliates, among them its existing Dallas outlet KDAF. One of the stations involved in the agreement was Dallas–Fort Worth's KDFW-TV, which had been affiliated with CBS since it signed on in December 1949. New World had included KDFW into the Fox agreement along with three of its sister stations — CBS affiliate KTBC in Austin and ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis — as a byproduct of the $717-million acquisition of the four Argyle Television Holdings-owned stations announced by New World on May 26. (New World exempted another Argyle station that it acquired, NBC affiliate WVTM-TV in Birmingham, from the affiliation deal as the group decided to transfer the ABC affiliate in that market, WBRC, into a trust company for later sale to Fox Television Stations to comply with ownership restrictions enforced at the time by the FCC that restricted a single company from owning more than twelve television stations nationwide and prohibited ownership of two commercial stations in the same market).\n\nCBS had enough time to find another Metroplex-area station with which it could reach an agreement, as, at the time of the New World-Fox agreement, its affiliation contract with KDFW would not expire for thirteen months (on July 1, 1995). CBS first approached KXAS-TV; however, its then-owner LIN Broadcasting subsequently signed a long-term affiliation deal renewing its contract with KXAS and its sister NBC affiliates in Austin, Norfolk and Grand Rapids. WFAA was eliminated as an option as its owner during that time, Belo, would reach a new long-term agreement with ABC for its Dallas flagship station and other ABC-affiliated stations that the group owned. This left KTVT, an independent station, as CBS's only viable option in the Dallas–Fort Worth market for landing a VHF affiliate; it approached Gaylord with an offer to affiliate with KTVT, in exchange for also switching KSTW to the network to replace KIRO-TV as its Seattle-area affiliate. However, as Time Warner asserted that its Dallas, Houston and Seattle stations were legally bound to draft affiliation proposals for The WB, on July 22, 1994, Gaylord—which had not signed a formal agreement—asked a judge with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to confirm that those stations were not \"legally obligated to 'affiliate'\" with The WB. Not pleased with Gaylord's about-face, on August 18, Time Warner filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Gaylord-CBS affiliation deal and enforce the alleged WB affiliation contract, alleging breach of contract and bad faith.\n\nDespite the dispute, on September 14, CBS and Gaylord signed a ten-year agreement with CBS to transfer the network's Metroplex affiliation to KTVT and its Seattle affiliation to KSTW (as a result of this deal, KIRO-TV—which would later rejoin CBS in June 1997—subsequently joined the nascent UPN in March 1995). The WB later reached an agreement with KDAF, which Fox Television Stations had announced it would sell in order to affiliate KDFW with the Fox network; KXTX-TV, in the meantime, agreed to serve as The WB's Metroplex charter affiliate in a temporary arrangement until the sale of KDAF to Renaissance Broadcasting and Fox's subsequent move to KDFW was finalized. As a consequence of its conversion into a \"Big Three\" affiliate, Gaylord and United Video agreed to cease distributing KTVT as a regional superstation and gradually terminated KTVT's carriage agreements with cable systems located outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth market and with satellite providers by the end of 1994. Most of the markets located within KTVT's large cable footprint – with the exception of some smaller markets that had to rely on an out-of-market affiliate to receive the network's programming – already had CBS-affiliated stations, which would have resulted in CBS programming being subject to blackout restrictions under the FCC's network non-duplication rules.\n\nAt the time it signed the contract with CBS, KTVT began airing \"The Price Is Right\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" within its daytime schedule, after KDFW chose to preempt them in favor of \"Donahue\" and the short-lived syndicated court show \"Juvenile Justice\", respectively, in the respective slots of the two CBS Daytime programs as part of its transition to Fox; Channel 11 also cleared select CBS prime time programs that KDFW-TV preempted in order to run locally produced specials. On the evening of July 1, 1995 at 10:00 p.m., during a break within the station's telecast of a Major League Baseball game between the Texas Rangers and the Seattle Mariners, Ed Trimble—KTVT's vice president and general manager at the time—delivered an on-air message informing viewers of the forthcoming network changes (David Whitaker, then the vice president and general manager at KDFW, also conducted a segment on the network switch that aired concurrently on channel 4; KTVT had aired a half-hour special detailing network affiliation changes involving channel 11, KDFW and KDAF, \"Are You Ready for This?\", preceding the game earlier that evening, among multiple other airings of the special during the weeks of June 25 and July 2).\n\nKTVT officially became a CBS affiliate on July 2, 1995, when the remainder of the network's programming lineup moved to the station; the first CBS network program to air on the station as a full-time affiliate was \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" at 8:00 a.m. Central Time that morning. The station also adopted \"The Eye of Texas\" as its slogan, in reference to both its CBS affiliation and the network's signature Eyemark logo, as well as a red and yellow boxed logo with a vertically parallelogrammed \"11\" inspired by the design used by eventual sister station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles at the time (adopted by that station in February 1994), which was also used by KSTW upon that station joining CBS. (During its first years as a CBS affiliate, station IDs identified the station as serving \"Dallas/Ft. Worth,\" out of accordance with FCC regulations that required television stations to list the station's city of license—in KTVT's case, Fort Worth—first, followed by any other cities the station may serve; traditionally and since, in compliance with these rules, KTVT has listed Fort Worth, with or without abbreviating \"Fort\" as \"Ft.,\" first among its cities of service in its station identifications.) As KDFW-TV took over the Fox affiliation on July 2, KDAF—whose sale to Renaissance Broadcasting was finalized the following day on July 3—formally assumed the WB affiliation from KXTX-TV, which concurrently reverted into an independent station.\n\nEven though it was now a \"Big Three\" affiliate, during its first year with CBS, KTVT's lineup of syndicated shows that aired outside of local newscasts and network programs—consisting mainly of off-network sitcoms held over from its existence as an independent (such as \"The Cosby Show\", \"Full House\", \"Matlock\" and \"Roseanne\") and first-run newsmagazines (such as \"Extra\" and the short-lived \"Day and Date\")—more closely resembled an inventory normally offered by an independent or minor network-affiliated station. Much of the syndicated sitcoms, drama series and cartoons that KTVT was forced to divest because of CBS' network-dominated programming schedule were acquired by KDAF and KTXA (which had become a UPN affiliate when that network launched in January 1995).\nGradually throughout the late 1990s, the station began taking on the look and format of a major network affiliate, expanding its local news programming and replacing the sitcoms that initially occupied its weekday schedule with more first-run syndicated newsmagazines and game shows. For much of the next decade, KTVT's sign-on to sign-off viewership averaged in fourth place, even as CBS rebounded in the ratings nationally after the network acquired the rights to the NFL's American Football Conference (AFC) from NBC in 1998; though the station would grow into a reasonably stronger position as a CBS affiliate compared to KSTW, which terminated its agreement with CBS in March 1997. (Cox Enterprises bought KSTW two months earlier, only to trade it to the Paramount Stations Group in exchange for KIRO, resulting in KSTW becoming a UPN owned-and-operated station and KIRO rejoining CBS, to resolve an ownership conflict with rival KING-TV that was created by Belo's purchase of The Providence Journal Company.)\n\nAt the time of the network switch, Gaylord had already begun winding down its television interests, selling its network affiliates, independent stations and cable networks to other groups.\n\nOn April 12, 1999, Gaylord announced its formal exit from television when the company agreed to sell KTVT—which had become the company's lone remaining broadcast television property—to CBS Television Stations for $485 million; the sale received FCC approval on August 3, 1999. The purchase placed KTVT under common ownership with Infinity Broadcasting Corporation's six Metroplex radio properties, KRLD (1080 AM), KLUV (98.7 FM), KRBV (100.3 FM, now KJKK), KVIL (103.7 FM), KYNG (105.3 FM, now KRLD-FM) and KOAI (107.5 FM, now KMVK). Also in 1999, KTVT relocated its primary operations from its Stemmons Freeway facility into an existing office facility on North Central Expressway (near the Walnut Hill neighborhood) that had remained under Gaylord ownership. The move was speculated to have been coordinated between Gaylord and CBS to consolidate CBS's radio operations with KTVT to reduce overhead costs.\n\nOn September 7, 1999, Viacom announced its intent to merge with (the original) CBS Corporation for $35.6 billion; the purchase was finalized on April 26, 2000, officially placing KTVT into a duopoly with then-UPN station KTXA as a result of the integration of CBS's group of owned-and-operated stations into Viacom's Paramount Stations Group subsidiary. (That transaction also effectively reunited KTVT with KSTW under common ownership.) Subsequently, KTXA relocated from its existing facilities at the Paramount Building in downtown Dallas and integrated its business operations with KTVT at its Bridge Street facility in Fort Worth. On January 3, 2006, the original Viacom split into two companies, with the original Viacom being restructured as CBS Corporation and a new company that assumed the Viacom name (which included, among other properties, Paramount Pictures and Viacom's cable television divisions, MTV Networks and BET Networks); KTVT/KTXA and the remainder of the Viacom Television Stations unit (renamed CBS Television Stations), Showtime Networks and Infinity Broadcasting (renamed CBS Radio) were spun off into CBS Corporation.\n\nOn August 26, 2013, KTVT/KTXA moved its Dallas business operations to a redeveloped office building at 12001 North Central Expressway (twenty blocks north of the previous Dallas facility at 10111 North Central, near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, between Walnut Hill and Meadow Road). The office tower that the stations began occupying—where KTVT's Dallas newsroom and the advertising sales offices for the duopoly occupy the top floor—was renamed CBS Tower. The station's primary studio facilities, and other technical and business operations remain at the Bridge Street facility in east Fort Worth; the former Dallas offices on North Central were purchased by Avial Hotels (the real estate development subsidiary of North Carolina-based Blue Star Hospitality) in November 2015, which intended to redevelop the building as a hotel.\n\nOn August 13, 2019, National Amusements announced that Viacom and CBS Corporation would recombine their assets into a singular entity to be named ViacomCBS in a deal valued at up to $15.4 billion. The acquisition was finalized on December 4, 2019, resulting in CBS Television Stations (and by association, KTVT/KTXA) becoming a ViacomCBS subsidiary.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn May 25, 2015, KTVT launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 11.2 to serve as a charter affiliate of Decades, a classic television network co-owned by CBS Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting (the latter of which holds responsibility of affiliate distribution to stations not owned by CBS) that features programs from the CBS Television Distribution library, including archival footage from CBS News. The network launched on that date with most of the CBS-owned television stations (except for its CW and independent stations in markets where the group maintains a duopoly) as well as Weigel-owned CBS affiliate WDJT-TV in Milwaukee among its charter outlets. On September 3, 2018, KTVT replaced Decades with Start TV.\n\nKTVT began transmitting a digital television signal on UHF channel 19 on May 1, 1999; for its first year of operation, KTVT-DT transmitted only in standard definition. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its transition period allocation on UHF channel 19 to VHF channel 11. Due to widespread reception problems and a resultant 57% loss of its household viewership in the Dallas–Fort Worth Designated Market Area, on July 23, 2009, the FCC granted KTVT permission via special temporary authorization to move its digital broadcast back to channel 19; concurrently, sister station KTXA was given permission via an STA to move back to channel 18, the assigned digital channel it used during the transition period. The channel change went into effect on August 4, 2009. Prior to that time, KTXA simulcast KTVT's programming on digital subchannel 21.2 (which would eventually be reinstated in December 2013 as an affiliate of MeTV). KTVT broadcast on UHF channel 19, in addition to operating its digital signal secondarily on its original analog and post-transition digital channel 11, until November 2012; both feeds were mapped to virtual channel 11.1, which caused many digital converter boxes and built-in tuners in digital-capable television sets to display that channel twice when tuning sequentially.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, the FCC issued a Report & Order statement, approving KTVT's move from channel 11 to channel 19; On October 21, 2009, it filed a minor change application for its new allotment, for which the FCC granted a construction permit the following month on November 19. concurrently, the agency granted KTXA's application to move its digital allocation from UHF channel 18 to channel 29, with the FCC granting them a construction permit on the date that KTVT received approval of its modified digital channel transfer application. \nOn November 26, 2012, KTVT terminated its original digital signal on VHF channel 11 and moved to its new channel 19 transmitting facilities (which operate from the same tower that KTXA's transmitter occupies).\n\nSyndicated programs broadcast by KTVT () includes \"Dr. Phil\", \"Tamron Hall\", \"Celebrity Page\", \"Madam Secretary\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\". (Currently, the Dallas–Fort Worth market is one of the few in which \"Wheel\" and \"Jeopardy!\" air on separate stations, as the latter program moved to sister station KTXA in September 2013, in order for channel 11 to launch a midday newscast.)\n\nSince it joined the network in July 1995, KTVT has carried the entire CBS schedule (prime time, daytime, late night, Saturday morning, news and sports programming), and as a CBS owned-and-operated station, it broadcasts the majority of its programs—other than those featured within its prime time lineup and network-televised sporting events—in pattern. However, it is one of the few CBS stations in the Central Time Zone (alongside those such as sister station WBBM-TV in Chicago, and affiliates such as WTVF in Nashville, KOLR in Springfield, Missouri and WHBF-TV in Davenport, Iowa) that airs \"The Young and the Restless\" at 11:30 a.m., having aired it on a half-hour delay since the cancellation of its noon newscast in early January 2004 (most CBS affiliates prefer to air the soap opera at 11:00 a.m. as a lead-in to their midday newscasts).\n\nLike many of its CBS-owned sister stations, it also airs \"Let's Make a Deal\" at 9:00 a.m. weekdays, instead of the 2:00 p.m. time slot where the program is carried nationally (this scheduling, which originated when \"Guiding Light\" occupied the final hour of CBS' daytime lineup prior to that program's discontinuance in September 2009, is more common among the network's owned-and-operated stations as well as select affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, where \"Let's Make a Deal\" would normally air in the 3:00 p.m. time slot). Since it joined the network, KTVT has also aired CBS' children's program blocks over both Saturdays and Sundays (currently, it airs a half-hour of the \"CBS Dream Team\" on Sunday mornings before \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" on weeks when the network is scheduled to air sports events on Saturday late mornings).\n\nIn 1985, KTVT obtained the broadcast rights to the Texas Rangers under a ten-year agreement. The contract was included in Gaylord Broadcasting president Edward L. Gaylord's purchase of a 33% ownership stake in the Major League Baseball franchise from Eddie Chiles; the purchase initially failed to reach the two-thirds votes among American League team owners (it failed in a vote of 9-5) to reach a confirmation vote among all league owners on January 11 of that year. Many of the MLB team owners were concerned that Gaylord would utilize his interest in the Rangers to expand KTVT into a national superstation along the lines of WTBS (which carried the Atlanta Braves), WGN-TV (which aired the Chicago Cubs and White Sox) and WWOR-TV (which held rights to the New York Mets). The sale and broadcast contract was approved by Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth in an invocation of a \"best interests of baseball\" clause on February 8 of that year, the terms of the contract required Gaylord/KTVT to pay retransmission fees for any games televised outside its six-state cable footprint. Gaylord was similarly stymied in his attempt to acquire Chiles's 58% interest in and majority control of the team, which instead went to a group led by eventual Texas Governor and U.S. President George W. Bush in conjunction with real estate developer H. Bert Mack and investor Frank L. Morsani in a $86-million deal struck in April 1989.\n\nKTVT aired an average of 95 Rangers games per season over the first ten years of the contract, which consisted entirely of away games up through the 1989 season; a limited schedule of home games (which had only been available locally on cable through regional sports network Home Sports Entertainment) was added in 1990, selected on the basis of whether the games were projected to have high ticket sales and attendance. After the station agreed to affiliate with CBS, KTVT and then-independent station KXTX-TV entered into a programming arrangement for the 1995 season, in which the latter station would carry CBS programs pre-empted by KTVT on dates when Rangers game telecasts were scheduled to air, in addition to — due to network affiliation contracts that limit the number of programming preemptions on an annual basis — some Rangers broadcasts that were produced by and contracted to air on Channel 11. The team formally moved its local over-the-air game broadcasts to KXTX in the 1996 season.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, KTVT served the flagship station of the highly-popular local pro wrestling program \"Saturday Night Wrestling\", and aired the two-hour wrestling program \"Championship Sports\" on Saturday nights. It has also broadcast college football and basketball events involving programs based around Texas; from 1984 until the conference folded after the 1995–96 season, the station aired football and men's basketball games from the now-defunct Southwestern Conference that were syndicated by Raycom Sports, including those involving the University of Texas Longhorns (it shared the broadcast rights to some of the game telecasts with KTXA).\n\nKTVT formerly served as the television flagship for the Dallas Mavericks from 1982 to 1998; it initially shared the rights to the NBA team's game broadcasts with WFAA, with KTVT running about 30 Dallas Mavericks games per season. KTXA became the sharing partner in the team's local broadcasting contract after it assumed WFAA's end of the contract beginning with the 1986–87 season. After KTVT joined CBS in 1995, the station continued to air a significantly reduced schedule of Mavericks telecasts, at which time KTXA took over the primary over-the-air rights; KTXA would acquire the remaining telecast rights held by Channel 11 starting with the 1998–99 season. Following the relocation of the former Minnesota North Stars from Minneapolis that year, Channel 11 also held the local rights to televise National Hockey League (NHL) games featuring the Dallas Stars during the 1993–94 season (the team's first season in Dallas).\n\nSince September 1998, KTVT has served as the official television partner of the Dallas Cowboys, holding rights to air various team-related programs during the regular season (including the \"Cowboys Postgame Show\", \"Special Edition with Jerry Jones\" and the head coach's weekly analysis program, along with specials such as the \"Making of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Calendar\" and postseason team reviews) as well as preseason games that are not televised nationally on broadcast or cable television. Through CBS' contract with the National Football League (NFL), under which it holds primary broadcast rights to the American Football Conference, Cowboys game telecasts on KTVT during the regular season are limited to interconference games against AFC teams played at AT&T Stadium (including those held every other year on Thanksgiving Day) and, since 2014, cross-flexed games originally scheduled to air on Fox against its fellow teams in the National Football Conference (NFC). Most other regular season games televised over-the-air locally air on KDFW, which has served as the Cowboys' primary local broadcaster since 1962 (with the exception of a one-season absence due to the transfer of NFC television rights to Fox in 1994, in the precursor to the affiliation switch), through Fox's rights to the NFC; KXAS-TV also carries certain regular season Cowboys games in which the team is a participant via NBC's rights to the \"Sunday Night Football\" package.\n\n, KTVT presently broadcasts 32½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5½ hours each weekday and 2½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition, the station produces two sports programs that it airs on Sunday nights after the 10:00 p.m. newscast: the sports highlight show \"The Score\" and the football highlight program \"The Blitz: The Dallas Cowboys Report\", which are both co-hosted by sports reporter and fill-in sports anchor Bill Jones (the latter program formerly produced a spin-off focusing on the Dallas Desperados, which was discontinued after the Arena Football League franchise folded in 2009).\n\nChannel 11 first established a news department as an independent station in 1960, when it debuted a half-hour local newscast at noon and a 15-minute newscast at 10:00 p.m.—the latter airing as an intermission within its late prime time movie presentations, which began at 9:00 p.m., and resumed until conclusion after the newscast—each weekday; the program featured anchors based in both Dallas and Fort Worth. In August 1960, the station premiered \"Reveille\", a half-hour weekday morning newscast that was anchored by Bill Camfield (who also played Icky Twerp as host of the children's program \"Slam Bang Theater\" from September 1959 to March 1972 and as Gargon in his role as host of the horror film showcase \"Nightmare\" from 1963 to 1966, and later served as the station's program director until 1972); the program ran until 1963. In 1981, the station began producing 60-second live news updates under the title \"Headline News\" (not to be confused with the cable channel now known as HLN, which debuted the following year), that aired during commercial breaks within the station's daytime and evening programming.\n\nGaylord Broadcasting management eventually decided to make investments to expand the station's news operations. On August 20, 1990, KTVT began producing a long-form, hour-long prime time newscast at 7:00 p.m., airing only on Monday through Friday nights, which was designed to appeal to viewers whose work schedule and evening commute prevented them from watching local early evening newscasts on KDFW, KXAS and WFAA. Debuting under the umbrella title \"Newswatch 11\", the newscasts were initially anchored by Mike Hambrick (whose brother, Judd, had previously served as anchor at KDFW from 1972 to 1973) and Midge Hill (who joined KTVT after a five-year stint as an anchor/reporter at WFAA), alongside chief meteorologist Bob Goosmann and sports director Bobby Estill. It was the first attempt in the Metroplex at a local newscast in the 7:00 p.m. timeslot since KRLD-TV/KDAF produced a one-hour news program at 7:00 from July 1984 until that station's initial news department was shut down by then-general manager Ray Schonbak in May 1986, following the completion of its purchase by News Corporation, after it struggled against prime time network programs on KDFW, KXAS and WFAA throughout that program's run.\n\nThe newscast was moved to 9:00 p.m. five months later on January 7, 1991, with then-general manager Ed Trimble citing frequent preemptions caused by KTVT's Texas Rangers and Dallas Mavericks game telecasts. (The move also allowed KTVT to accommodate earlier airings caused by Texas Rangers, Dallas Stars and Dallas Mavericks evening games that the station was scheduled to air between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m., rather than delaying it until after the game concluded.) The timeslot shift made it the first such newscast to be offered by a commercial television station in the Metroplex in the 9:00 time slot (predating rival KDFW's addition of its own late evening newscast in that hour when it switched from CBS to Fox in July 1995, and the formation of KDAF's news department with the debut of its own 9:00 p.m. newscast in 1999; PBS member station KERA-TV [channel 13] previously carried a newscast at 9:00 p.m. from 1970 to 1976).\nThe weeknight editions of the 9:00 newscast were expanded to one hour on February 1, 1993, at which time the late newscast was retitled \"The Nine O'Clock News\" (subtitled \"The Nine O'Clock News: Special Edition\" for editions aired in advance due to sports events). (The logo and imaging package introduced with the rebrand would be used by certain independent stations and minor network affiliates, such as KOCB [now a CW affiliate] in Oklahoma City, during the mid-1990s.) By this time, Estill had left his position as sports director in 1992 and was replaced by Curt Menefee; Ken Malloy would take over as Hill's co-anchor following Hambrick's departure a few months after the program's title change. Hour-long Saturday and Sunday editions of the newscast were added on March 12, 1994, with co-anchors Beth McKay and Jerry Jenkins (who had been reporters at the station since the start of in-house news operations), meteorologist Brad Barton (a veteran news and weather anchor at KRLD radio since 1978, who continued his duties at that station after joining KTVT) and sports anchor Timm Matthews (who would later replace Menefee as sports director following his departure for Fox Sports) initially helming the weekend broadcasts. Matthews also hosted the half-hour sports highlight program, \"First Sports\", which debuted the following day on March 13 as a lead-out for the abbreviated half-hour Sunday edition of the newscast. \"The Nine O'Clock News\" grew to become a strong ratings performer in the 9:00 p.m. timeslot, holding its own in the midst of competition from network drama series and newsmagazines that aired against it on the market's \"Big Three\" affiliates.\n\nAs CBS was seeking a station to replace KDFW as its Metroplex outlet, the fact that KTVT was the only English-language station in the Metroplex not affiliated with either of the \"Big Three\" networks that had a functioning news department played a major factor in the network's decision to approach Gaylord about negotiating a deal to move its programming to the station. Upon becoming a CBS affiliate on July 1, 1995, KTVT relaunched its news department under the \"11 News\" brand (later retitled \"CBS 11 News\" in January 2000), and made extensive changes to its news schedule with the debut of an hour-long morning newscast at 6:00 a.m. and an early-evening newscast at 6:00 p.m. on Monday through Fridays. The existing late-evening newscast concurrently moved one hour later to 10:00 p.m., while the late edition of that newscast on Saturdays and Sundays was accompanied by early-evening newscasts on both days; until May 1998, the late newscast maintained the \"11 on 11\" format, which emphasized a nonstop rundown of the day's top local and national headlines and a \"Forecast First\" weather segment prior to the first commercial break in an 11-minute-long \"A\"-block, with an in-depth \"11 News Extra\" report and a sports segment filling the remaining segments of the newscast. (Seattle sister station KSTW also adopted the \"Eleven @ 11:00\" format for its 11:00 p.m. newscast from March 1995 to June 1997, using the primarily numeric \"11 at 11\" as the title.)\n\nIn turn, the station also increased its on-air and behind-the-scenes news staff from 40 to 80 employees, hiring among others Cameron Harper (who replaced Malloy, who was moved to the daytime newscasts, as weeknight co-anchor); Hill, Goosmann, McKay (who would shift to weekend sports anchor in 1997), Jenkins and Matthews were among a handful of on-air staffers that stayed with the news department following the CBS switch (Hill was fired by the station in November 1995 and was replaced as weeknight co-anchor by Karen Borta, who remained in that role until February 2015, when Borta was moved to the weekday morning newscast; Goosmann remained chief meteorologist until he left KTVT in 2001). On that date, the station also adopted the on-air imaging that Seattle sister station KSTW implemented when that station joined CBS four months earlier on March 13, which, in addition to the aforementioned parallelogram \"11\" logo design, was accompanied by that station's graphics package, set design and newscast theme music (\"Millennium 3\", a syndicated package composed by Shelly Palmer that was originally commissioned by Gaylord for KTVT and KSTW, which the former used until 1999).\n\nDuring the station's first decade with CBS, newscasts were added and dropped from KTVT's schedule. Channel 11 would first expand news programming with the debut of half-hour weekday newscasts at noon and 5:00 p.m. in February 1996. In January 1999, it added a 6:30 p.m. newscast on weeknights as a replacement for \"Hard Copy\" (which had been airing on KTVT since September 1997, when the program moved to the station from KDFW); the newscast was later replaced in September 2000 by \"Hollywood Squares\" (which had previously aired on WFAA from the revival series' September 1998 premiere until June 2000). Concurrent with the discontinuance of \"Hard Copy\" following its cancellation, the station debuted an hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscast on September 11 of that year; after the program's initial cancellation in September 2002, KTVT restored that newscast in January 2004 (later reducing it to a half-hour broadcast in September 2005, before expanding it to an hour once more on January 11, 2010). The noon newscast returned in September 2005, but was subsequently cancelled the following month after it moved \"Jeopardy!\" from its previous 4:30 p.m. timeslot to 11:00 a.m. (KTVT would eventually restore a midday news program, with the debut of a half-hour 11:00 a.m. newscast on August 12, 2013, which replaced \"Jeopardy!\" after the game show was moved to KTXA). In September 2006, due to budget cuts imposed by CBS Corporation, KTVT discontinued its morning newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays, making it the only \"Big Four\" network station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market that did not have a weekend morning newscast for the next eight years until KTVT launched hour-long weekend editions of \"CBS 11 News This Morning\" on both days on September 20, 2014.\n\nFor most of the time since it joined CBS, KTVT has been one of the network's weaker stations in terms of total day and local news viewership. However, it has made gains in viewership in some time periods since the late 2000s, even beating overall first place stalwart WFAA in some time periods. During the February 2011 sweeps period, the station's 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts placed first among total viewers for the first time in the station's history. That May, KTVT had placed second overall in both total viewership and in the demographic of adults ages 25–54 by small margins for the first time in its history; this is in comparison to the May sweeps period of the previous year, in which Channel 11 won in both total viewers and 25- to 54-year-olds. The 5:00, 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts all saw ratings increases in both demographics placing second.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, KTVT became the third television station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market (after WFAA and KXAS) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high-definition. In May 2010, KTVT became among the first CBS O&Os to adopt the group's new standardized graphics package (which was first implemented that February by sister stations WCBS-TV in New York City and KCBS-TV in Los Angeles), and accordingly began using the \"New Generation\" series of \"The CBS Enforcer Music Collection\" by Gari Media Group as the theme music for its newscasts.\n\nKTVT launched a streaming news service, CBSN Dallas–Ft. Worth (a localized version of the national CBSN service) on May 18, 2020, as part of a rollout of similar services across the CBS-owned stations.\n\n\n\n"}

They were partially created by Alfred Ledwig before being developed by Władysław Nehrebecki and Leszek Lorek. The series is about two young brothers and their fun (and sometimes silly) adventures which often involve spending a lot of time outdoors.\n\nThe characters first appeared in an animated film in 1962. Their names are diminutives of Bolesław and Karol. In English, the cartoon was distributed as Bennie & Lennie and Jym and Jam. Some episodes were seen as part of Nickelodeon's \"Pinwheel\". In 1973 the creators of the film placed on the request from the female viewing audience a girl character by the name of Tola, a little girl who lives in the forest, and meets Bolek and Lolek there. The first time she appeared in occurred in the episode entitled \"Tola\". In total, Tola appeared in 30 episodes.\n\nIn a similar vein to The Pink Panther theatrical cartoons, most episodes do not have dialogues. Exceptions are feature-length films and the series from the 1980s, where the main characters' voices were done by: Bolek – Ewa Złotowska, Ilona Kuśmierska; Lolek – Danuta Mancewicz, Danuta Przesmycka.\n\nDuring the period of the Polish People's Republic, Bolek and Lolek were reproduced in a large quantity of toys: action figures, movies, postcards, online arcades, puzzles, etc., which can be seen in the Museum of Dobranocki (bed-time stories) of the PRL. They are also currently made in computer programs, coloring books, general picture books and games.\n\nOf all the Polish animated cartoons Bolek and Lolek ranks as the number one all-time favorite. The series was popular in many countries, and was one of the few animated films allowed to be broadcast by Iranian television, along with other popular Polish animated cartoon Reksio, just after the Iranian Revolution of 1979.\n\nIn 2011 a monument of Bolek and Lolek was erected in Bielsko-Biała.\n\nThe copyright holders of Polish cartoon Bolek and Lolek filed a lawsuit in 2006 to examine a case of the illegal use of the images of Bolek and Lolek by German homosexuals who wanted to encourage German homosexual minorities to participate in the Warsaw Pride Parade.\n\nThe copyright holders, Alfred Ledwig, Władysław Nehrebecki, and Leszek Lorek, felt indignant with what they alleged to be an illegal use of the images of Bolek and Lolek on the cover of German magazine \"Siegessäule\" without their permission. The characters had been changed, and Bolek was transformed into a woman. The owners took particular offense to the suggestion of Bolek and Lolek's apparent homosexuality in the image. During one of the interviews, Roman Nehrebecki commented, \"The most important thing for me is that children were used for the purposes they should not be used for, for promoting ideas and organizations.\" The residents of Bielsko-Biała, the city where Bolek and Lolek were created, also signed petitions against the improper use of the image of the characters.\n\nThe lawsuit lasted two years and took place in Berlin. The main line of defense of the magazine's owners was the fact that in 2005 the president of Warsaw, Lech Kaczyński, forbade the organization the Pride Parade, manifesting inclination toward uneven treatment of minorities. However, this argument was deemed insignificant by the court, since the subject of the dispute was violation of copyright on the image of Bolek and Lolek and not on the alleged unfair treatment of homosexual minorities. Despite the fact that the lawsuit was prolonged due to the complex German judicial proceedings, it was closed with an agreement. German magazine \"Siegessäule\" was obliged to pay the copyright owners 4,000 euro in compensation, as well as to publish an official apology in their pages.\n\n\n\"Bolek and Lolek\" - 13 Episodes, 1962–1964.\n\n\n\"Benny and Lenny on Vacation\" - 13 episodes, 1965.\n\n\n\"Benny and Lenny travel the world\" - 18 episodes, 1968–1970.\n\n\n\"The Tales of Bolek and Lolek\" - 13 episodes, 1970–1971.\n\n\n\"The Adventures of Bolek and Lolek\" - 63 episodes, 1972–1980.\n\n\n\"Benny and Lenny in the Wild West\" - 7 episodes, 1971–1972.\n\n\n\"Fun with Bolek and Lolek\" - 7 episodes, 1975–1976.\n\n\n\"Bolek and Lolek's Great Journey\" - 15 episodes, 1978.\n\n\n\"Benny and Lenny Among the Miners\" - 7 episodes, 1980.\n\n\n\"Olympics with Bolek and Lolek\" - 13 episodes, 1983–1984.\n\n\n\"Benny and Lenny in Europe\" - 5 episodes, 1983–1986.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was once treated as the sole genus in the family, but has been split into four genera (see: Casuarinaceae).\nThey are evergreen shrubs and trees growing to tall. The slender, green to grey-green twigs bearing minute scale-leaves in whorls of 5–20. The apetalous flowers are produced in small catkin-like inflorescences. Most species are dioecious, but a few are monoecious. The fruit is a woody, oval structure superficially resembling a conifer cone, made up of numerous carpels, each containing a single seed with a small wing. The generic name is derived from the Malay word for the cassowary, \"kasuari\", alluding to the similarities between the bird's feathers and the plant's foliage, though the tree is called \"rhu\" in current standard Malay.\n\nKaren Louise Wilson and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson distinguish the two very closely related genera, \"Casuarina\" and \"Allocasuarina\" on the basis of:\n\n\"Casuarina\" species are a food source of the larvae of hepialid moths; members of the genus \"Aenetus\", including \"A. lewinii\" and \"A. splendens\", burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. \"Endoclita malabaricus\" also feeds on \"Casuarina\".

The species has nearly quadrupled in southern Florida between 1993 and 2005, where it is known as Australian pine.\n\"C. equisetifolia\" is widespread in the Hawaiian Islands where it grows both on the seashore in dry, salty, calcareous soils and up in the mountains in high rainfall areas on volcanic soils.

{"id": "1810438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810438", "title": "Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya", "text": "Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya\n\nShams al-Dīn Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ayyūb al-Zurʿī l-Dimashqī l-Ḥanbalī (1292–1350 CE / 691 AH–751 AH), commonly known as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (\"The son of the principal of [the school of] Jawziyyah\") or Ibn al-Qayyim (\"Son of the principal\"; ابن قيم الجوزية) for short, or reverentially as Imam Ibn al-Qayyim in Sunni tradition, was an important medieval Islamic jurisconsult, theologian, and spiritual writer. Belonging to the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, of which he is regarded as \"one of the most important thinkers,\" Ibn al-Qayyim is today best remembered as the foremost disciple and student of the controversial and influential fourteenth-century Sunni reformer Ibn Taymiyyah, with whom he was imprisoned in 1326 for dissenting against established tradition during Ibn Taymiyyah's famous incarceration in the Citadel of Damascus.\n\nOf humble origin, Ibn al-Qayyim's father was the principal (\"qayyim\") of the School of Jawziyya, which also served as a court of law for the Hanbali judge of Damascus during the time period. Ibn al-Qayyim went on to become a prolific scholar, producing a rich corpus of \"doctrinal and literary\" works. As a result, numerous important Muslim scholars of the Mamluk period were among Ibn al-Qayyim's students or, at least, greatly influenced by him, including, amongst others, the Shafi historian Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), the Hanbali hadith scholar Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1397), and the Shafi polymath Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852/1449). In the present day, Ibn al-Qayyim's name has become a controversial one in certain quarters of the Islamic world due to his popularity amongst many adherents of the Sunni reform movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, who see in his criticisms of such widespread orthodox Sunni practices of the medieval period as the veneration of saints and the veneration of their graves and relics a classical precursor to their own perspective.\n\nMuhammad Ibn Abī Bakr Ibn Ayyub Ibn Sa'd Ibn Harīz Ibn Makkī Zayn al-Dīn al-Zur'ī (), al-Dimashqi (الدمشقي), with kunya of Abu Abdullah (أبو عبد الله), called Shams al-Dīn ( شمس الدین). He is usually known as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, after his father Abu Bakr Ibn Sa'd al-Zur'ī who was the superintendent (\"qayyim\") of the Jawziyyah Madrasah, the Hanbali law college in Damascus.\n\nIbn al-Qayyim's main teacher was the scholar Ibn Taymiyyah. Ibn Qayyim first met Ibn Taymiyyah at the age of 21 and spent the rest of his life learning from him. As a result of this union he shared his teacher's views in most issues.\n\nIbn al-Qayyim was imprisoned along with his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. According to the historian al-Maqrizi, two reasons led to his arrest: the first was a sermon Ibn al-Qayyim had delivered in Jerusalem in which he decried the visitation of holy graves, including the Prophet Muhammad's grave in Medina, the second was his agreement with Ibn Taymiyyah's view on the matter of divorce, which \ncontradicted the view of the majority of scholars in Damascus.\n\nThe campaign to have Ibn al-Qayyim imprisoned was led by Shafi'i and Maliki scholars, and was also joined by the Hanbali and Hanafi judges.\n\nWhilst in prison Ibn al-Qayyim busied himself with the Qur'an. According to Ibn Rajab, Ibn al-Qayyim made the most of his time of imprisonment: the immediate result of his delving into the Qur'an while in prison was a series of mystical experiences (described as dhawq, direct experience of the divine mysteries, and mawjud, ecstasy occasioned by direct encounter with the Divine Reality).\n\nIbn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya wrote a lengthy spiritual commentary on a treatise written by the Hanbali Sufi Khwaja Abdullah Ansari entitled \"Madarij al-Salikin\".\n\nHe expressed his love and appreciation for Ansari in this commentary with his statement \"\"Certainly I love the Sheikh, but I love the truth more!\"'. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya refers to Ansari with the honorific title \"\"Sheikh al-Islam\"\" in his work \"Al-Wabil al-Sayyib min al-Kalim al-Tayyab\".\n\nIbn al-Qayyim died at the age of 60 years, 5 months, and 5 days, on the 13th night of Rajab, 751 AH (September 15, 1350 CE), and was buried besides his father at the Bab al-Saghīr Cemetery.\n\nLike his teacher Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Qayyim, supported broad powers for the state and prosecution. He argued, for example, \"that it was often right to punish someone of lowly status\" who alleged improper behavior by someone \"more respectable.\"\n\nIbn Qayyim \"formulated evidential theories\" that made judges \"less reliant than ever before on the oral testimony.\" One example was the establishment of a child's paternity by experts scrutinizing the faces of \"a child and its alleged father for similarities\". Another was in determining impotence. If a woman sought a divorce on the grounds of her husband's impotence and her husband contested the claim, a judge might obtain a sample of the husband's ejaculate. According to Ibn Qayyim \"only genuine semen left a white residue when boiled\".\n\nIn interrogating the accused, Ibn Qayyim believed that testimony could be beaten out of suspects if they were \"disreputable\". \nThis was in contrast to the majority of Islamic jurists who had always acknowledged \"that alleged sinners were entitled to remain silent if accused.\" Attorney and author Sadakat Kadri states that, \"as a matter of straightforward history, torture had originally been forbidden by Islamic jurisprudence.\" Ibn Qayyim however, believed that \"the Prophet Muhammad, the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and other Companions\" would have supported his position.\n\nIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah opposed alchemy and divination of all varieties, but was particularly opposed to astrology, whose practitioners dared to \"think they could know secrets locked within the mystery of God's supreme and all-embracing wisdom.\" In fact, those who believed that human personalities and events were influenced by heavenly bodies, were \"the most ignorant of people, the most in error and the furthest from humanity ... the most ignorant of people concerning his soul and its creator\".\n\nIn his \"Miftah Dar al-Sa'adah\", in addition to denouncing the astrologers as worse than infidels, he uses empirical arguments to refute the practice of alchemy and astrology along with the theories associated with them, such as divination and the transmutation of metals, for example arguing:\n\nAlthough Ibn al-Qayyim is sometimes characterized today as an unabashed enemy of Islamic mysticism, it is historically known that he actually had a “great interest in Sufism,” which arose out of his vast exposure to the practice given Sufism's integral role in orthodox Islamic life at his time. Some of his major works, such as \"Madārij, Ṭarīq al-hijratayn\" (\"Path of the Two Migrations\") and \"Miftāḥ dār al-saʿāda\" (\"Key to the Joyous Dwelling\"), \"are devoted almost entirely to Sufi themes,\" yet allusions to such \"themes are found in nearly all his writings,\" including in such influential works of spiritual devotion such as \"al-Wābil al-Ṣayyib\", a highly important treatise detailing the importance of the practice of dhikr, and his revered \"magnum opus\", \"Madārij al-sālikīn\" (\"The Wayfarers' Stages\"), which is an extended commentary on a work written by the eleventh-century Hanbalite saint and mystic Abdullah Ansari, whom Ibn al-Qayyim referred to reverentially as \"Shaykh al-Islām.\" In all such writings, it is evident Ibn al-Qayyim wrote to address \"those interested in Sufism in particular and ... 'the matters of the heart' ... in general,\" and proof of this lies in the fact that he states, in the introduction to his short book \"Patience and Gratitude\", \"This is a book to benefit kings and princes, the wealthy and the indigent, Sufis and religious scholars; (a book) to inspire the sedentary to set out, accompany the wayfarer on the Way (\"al-sā'ir fī l-ṭariq\") and inform the one journeying towards the Goal.\" Some scholars have compared Ibn al-Qayyim's role to that of Ghazali two-hundred years prior, in that he tried \"rediscover and restate the orthodox roots of Islam's interior dimension.\"\n\nIt is also true, however, that Ibn al-Qayyim did indeed share some of his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah's more negative sentiments towards what he perceived to be excesses in mystical practice. For example, he felt that the pervasive and powerful influence the works of Ibn Arabi had begun to wield over the entire Sunni world was leading to errors in doctrine. As a result, he rejected Ibn Arabi's concept of wahdat al-wajud or the \"oneness of being, \" and opposed, moreover, some of the more extreme \"forms of Sufism that had gained currency particularly in the new seat of Muslim power, Mamluk Egypt and Syria.\" That said, he never condemned Sufism outright, and his many works bear witness, as it has been noted above, to the immense reverence in which he held the vast majority of Sufi tradition. In this connection, it is also significant that Ibn al-Qayyim followed Ibn Taymiyyah in \"consistently praising\" the early spiritual master al-Junayd, one of the most famous saints in the Sufi tradition, as well as \"other early spiritual masters of Baghdad who later became known as 'sober' Sufis.\" As a matter of fact, Ibn al-Qayyim did not condemn the ecstatic Sufis either, regarding their mystical outbursts as signs of spiritual \"weakness\" rather than heresy. Ibn al-Qayyim's highly nuanced position on this matter led to his composing apologies for the ecstatic outbursts of several early Sufis, just as many Sufis had done so before him.\n\nHe was very critical of Christians and their beliefs, calling them among many “the brothers of swines”. “Congratulating Christians in their celebrations is as same as congratulating them for worshiping their cross and believing in Jesus as son of the God.” In his book, Kitab Hidayat ul-Hayara, he writes: \n\n“The Christians are misguided cross worshippers. They are those who swear at Allah (swt) the Creator in a way no other human has sworn at Allah (swt).\n\nThey are like those before who did not believe that Allah is unique as stated in Surah Ikhlas, nor do they make him greater than everything; rather they say, “the heaven and earth will crack and the mountains will fall down.”\n\nThe base of their Aqeedah and their biggest curse against Allah (swt) is the Trinity. According to the Christians Mariam (as) is the lover of Allah (swt) and Isa (as) is His son. They claim the Almighty Allah came down from His great chair and melted in the womb of Mariam (as), until He was killed and buried at the hands of man.\n\nIts Deen is the worship of the cross; its supplication is for the images that are drawn on the wall, in red and yellow colours. They say in their prayer “O mother of God provide for us, forgive us and have mercy on us.”\n\nTheir Deen is to drink alcohol, eat pork, desert circumcision, worship with impurity and eat everything, even if it is filthy, whether that be the elephant or the mosquito. What is lawful and unlawful is what their priests say; the priests can take them to heaven and forgive their sins.\"\n\nHe also wrote a poem called “Oh, Worshippers of Christ!” in which he calls Christians “liars, fabricators and cross worshippers.”\n\nIbn Qayyim was respected by a number of scholars during and after his life. Ibn Kathir stated that Ibn al-Qayyim, \n\nIbn Rajab, one of Ibn Qayyim's students, stated that, \n\nHe was praised by many Sunni scholars and is still praised and highly regarded as a pious believer today. \n\nIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah's contributions to the Islamic library are extensive, and they particularly deal with the Qur'anic commentaries, and understanding and analysis of the prophetic traditions (\"Fiqh-us Sunnah\") (فقه ). He \"wrote about a hundred books\", including:\n\n"}

It was known as the region of Pera (Πέρα, meaning \"Beyond\" in Greek) surrounding the ancient coastal town Galata which faced Constantinople across the Horn. Beyoğlu continued to be named Pera during the Middle Ages and, in western languages, into the early 20th century.\n\nAccording to the prevailing theory, the Turkish name of Pera, \"Beyoğlu\", is a modification by folk etymology of the Venetian ambassadorial title of \"Bailo\", whose palazzo was the most grandiose structure in this quarter. The informal Turkish-language title \"Bey Oğlu\" (literally \"Son of a Bey\") was originally used by the Ottoman Turks to describe Lodovico Gritti, Istanbul-born son of Andrea Gritti, who was the Venetian Bailo in Istanbul during the reign of Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1481–1512) and was later elected Doge of Venice in 1523. \"Bey Oğlu\" thus referred to Lodovico Gritti, who established close relations with the Sublime Porte, and whose mansion was near the present-day Taksim Square. Located further south in Beyoğlu and originally built in the early 16th century, the \"Venetian Palace\" was the seat of the Bailo. The original palace building was replaced by the existing one in 1781, which later became the Italian Embassy following Italy's unification in 1861, and the Italian Consulate in 1923, when Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe district encompasses other neighborhoods located north of the Golden Horn, including Galata (the medieval Genoese citadel from which Beyoğlu itself originated, which is today known as Karaköy), Tophane, Cihangir, Şişhane, Tepebaşı, Tarlabaşı, Dolapdere and Kasımpaşa, and is connected to the old city center across the Golden Horn through the Galata Bridge, Atatürk Bridge and Golden Horn Metro Bridge. Beyoğlu is the most active art, entertainment and nightlife centre of Istanbul.\n\nThe area now known as Beyoğlu has been inhabited since Byzas founded the City of Byzantium in the 7th century BC, and predates the founding of Constantinople. During the Byzantine era, Greek speaking inhabitants named the hillside covered with orchards Sykai (The Fig Orchard), or Peran en Sykais (The Fig Field on the Other Side), referring to the \"other side\" of the Golden Horn. As the Byzantine Empire grew, so did Constantinople and its environs. The northern side of the Golden Horn became built up as a suburb of Byzantium as early as the 5th century. In this period the area began to be called Galata, and Emperor Theodosius II (reigned 402–450) built a fortress. The Greeks believe that the name comes either from \"galatas\" (meaning \"milkman\"), as the area was used by shepherds in the early medieval period, or from the word \"Galatai\" (meaning \"Gauls\"), as the Celtic tribe of Gauls were thought to have camped here during the Hellenistic period before settling into Galatia in central Anatolia, becoming known as the Galatians. The inhabitants of Galatia are famous for the Epistle to the Galatians and the Dying Galatian statue. The name may have also derived from the Italian word \"Calata\", meaning \"downward slope\", as Galata, formerly a colony of the Republic of Genoa between 1273 and 1453, stands on a hilltop that goes downwards to the sea.\n\nThe area came to be the base of European merchants, particularly from Genoa and Venice, in what was then known as Pera. Following the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and during the Latin Empire of Constantinople (1204–1261), the Venetians became more prominent in Pera. The Dominican Church of St. Paul (1233), today known as the \"Arap Camii\", is from this period.\n\nIn 1273 the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos granted Pera to the Republic of Genoa in recognition of Genoa's support of the Empire after the Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople in 1204. Pera became a flourishing trade colony, ruled by a podestà.\n\nThe \"Genoese Palace\" (Palazzo del Comune) was built in 1316 by Montano de Marinis, the Podestà of Galata (Pera), and still remains today in ruins, near the Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Karaköy, along with its adjacent buildings and numerous Genoese houses from the early 14th century.\n\nIn 1348 the Genoese built the famous Galata Tower, one of the most prominent landmarks of Istanbul. Pera (Galata) remained under Genoese control until May 29, 1453, when it was conquered by the Ottomans along with the rest of the city, after the Siege of Constantinople.\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, the Genoese Podestà ruled over the Italian community of Galata (Pera), which was mostly made up of the Genoese, Venetians, Tuscans and Ragusans.\n\nFollowing the Turkish siege of Constantinople in 1453, during which the Genoese sided with the Byzantines and defended the city together with them, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II allowed the Genoese (who had fled to their colonies in the Aegean Sea such as Lesbos and Chios) to return to the city, but Galata was no longer run by a Genoese Podestà.\n\nVenice, Genoa's archrival, regained control in the strategic citadel of Galata (Pera), which they were forced to leave in 1261 when the Byzantines retook Constantinople and brought an end to the Latin Empire (1204–1261) that was established by Enrico Dandolo, the Doge of Venice.\n\nVenice immediately established political and commercial ties with the Ottoman Empire, and a Venetian Bailo was sent to Pera as an ambassador, during the Byzantine period. It was the Venetians who suggested Leonardo da Vinci to Bayezid II when the Sultan mentioned his intention to construct a bridge over the Golden Horn, and Leonardo designed his Galata Bridge in 1502.\n\nThe Bailo's seat was the \"Venetian Palace\", originally built in Beyoğlu in the early 16th century and replaced by the existing palace building in 1781; which later became the \"Italian Embassy\" after the unification of Italy in 1861, and the \"Italian Consulate\" in 1923, when Ankara became the new Turkish capital.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire had an interesting relationship with the Republic of Venice. Even though the two states often went to war over the control of East Mediterranean territories and islands, they were keen on restoring their trade pacts once the wars were over, such as the renewed trade pacts of 1479, 1503, 1522, 1540 and 1575 following major sea wars between the two sides. The Venetians were also the first Europeans to taste Ottoman delicacies such as coffee, centuries before other Europeans saw coffee beans for the first time in their lives during the Battle of Vienna in 1683. These encounters can be described as the beginning of today's rich \"coffee culture\" in both Venice (and later the rest of Italy) and Vienna.\n\nFollowing the conquest of Constantinople and Pera in 1453, the coast and the low-lying areas were quickly settled by the Turks, but the European presence in the area did not end. Several Roman Catholic churches, as St. Anthony of Padua, SS. Peter and Paul in Galata and St. Mary Draperis were established for the needs of the Levantine population.\n\nDuring the 19th century it was again home to many European traders, and housed many embassies, especially along the Grande Rue de Péra (today İstiklâl Avenue). The presence of such a prominent European population - commonly referred to as Levantines - made it the most Westernized part of Constantinople, especially when compared to the Old City at the other side of the Golden Horn, and allowed for influxes of modern technology, fashion, and arts. Thus, Pera was one of the first parts of Constantinople to have telephone lines, electricity, trams, municipal government and even an underground railway, the Tünel, inaugurated in 1875 as the world's second subway line (after London's Underground) to carry the people of Pera up and down from the port of Galata and the nearby business and banking district of Karaköy, where the \"Bankalar Caddesi\" (\"Banks Street\"), the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, is located. The theatre, cinema, patisserie and café culture that still remains strong in Beyoğlu dates from this late Ottoman period. Shops like İnci, famous for its chocolate mousse and profiteroles, predate the founding of the republic and survived until recently.\n\nPera and Galata in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were a part of the \"Municipality of the Sixth Circle\" (), established under the laws of 11 Jumada al-Thani (Djem. II) and 24 Shawwal (Chev.) 1274, in 1858; the organisation of the central city in the city walls, \"Stamboul\" (), was not affected by these laws. All of Constantinople was in the \"Prefecture of the City of Constantinople\" ().\n\nThe foreign communities also built their own schools, many of which went on to educate the elite of future generations of Turks, and still survive today as some of the best schools in Istanbul (see list of schools in Istanbul).\n\nThe rapid modernization which took place in Europe and left Ottoman Turkey behind was symbolized by the differences between Beyoğlu, and the historic Turkish quarters such as Eminönü and Fatih across the Golden Horn, in the Old City. When the Ottoman sultans finally initiated a modernization program with the Edict of Tanzimat (Reorganization) in 1839, they started constructing numerous buildings in Beyoğlu that mixed traditional Ottoman styles with newer European ones.\n\nIn addition, Sultan Abdülmecid stopped living in the Topkapı Palace and built a new palace near Beyoğlu, called the Dolmabahçe Palace, which blended the Neo-Classical, Baroque and Rococo styles.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire collapsed and the Turkish Republic was founded (during and after the First World War) Beyoğlu went into gradual decline. The decline accelerated with the departure of the large Greek population of Pera and adjacent Galata as a result of Turkish pressure over the Cyprus conflict, during the 1950s and 1960s. The widespread political violence between leftist and rightist groups which troubled Turkey in the late 1970s also severely affected the lifestyle of the district, and accelerated its decline with the flight of the middle-class citizens to newer suburban areas such as Levent and Yeşilköy.\n\nBy the late 1980s, many of the grandiose Neoclassical and Art Nouveau apartment-blocks, formerly the residences of the late Ottoman élite, became home to immigrants from the countryside. While Beyoğlu continued to enjoy a reputation for its cosmopolitan and sophisticated atmosphere until the 1940s and 1950s, by the 1980s the area had become economically and socially troubled.\n\nThe first decades of the 21st century have witnessed the rapid gentrification of these neighborhoods. Istiklal Avenue has once again become a destination for tourists, and formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Cihangir have once again become fashionable and quite expensive. Some 19th and early 20th century buildings have been tastefully restored, while others have been converted into mammoth luxury malls of dubious aesthetic value. As newer, more international and affluent residents have begun to creep down the hills into Tophane and Tarlabasi, disagreements with more conservative elements in the neighborhoods have become common.\n\nThe low-lying areas such as Tophane, Kasımpaşa and Karaköy, and the side-streets of the area consist of older buildings.\n\nParallel to İstiklal Avenue runs the wide bi-directional boulevard named Tarlabaşı Caddesi, which carries most of the traffic through the area and was constructed in the 1980s. The streets on either side of this road contain historic buildings and churches. The once cosmopolitan areas surrounding them have deteriorated.\n\nForeigners, especially from Euro-Mediterranean and West European countries, have long resided in Beyoğlu. There is a cosmopolitan atmosphere in the heart of the district, where people from various cultures live in Cihangir and Gümüşsuyu. Beyoğlu also has a number of historical Tekkes and Türbes. Several Sufi orders, such as the \"Cihangirî\" (pronounced \"Jihangiri\") order, were founded here.\n\nMost of the consulates (former embassies until 1923, when Ankara became the new Turkish capital) are still in this area; the Italian, British, German, Greek, Russian, Dutch, and Swedish consulates are significant in terms of their history and architecture.\n\nBeyoğlu is also home to many high schools like Galatasaray Lisesi, Deutsche Schule Istanbul, St. George's Austrian High School, Lycée Sainte Pulchérie, Liceo Italiano, Beyoğlu Anatolian High School, Beyoğlu Kız Lisesi, Zografeion Lyceum, Zappeion Lyceum, and numerous others.\n\nThe unique international art project United Buddy Bears was presented in Beyoðlu during the winter of 2004–2005.\n\nThe main thoroughfare is İstiklâl Caddesi, running into the neighbourhood from Taksim Square, a pedestrianised long street of shops, cafés, patisseries, restaurants, pubs, winehouses and clubs, as well as bookshops, theatres, cinemas and art galleries. Some of İstiklâl Avenue has a 19th-century metropolitan character, and the avenue is lined with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau buildings. The nostalgic tram which runs on İstiklal Avenue, between Taksim Square and Tünel, was also re-installed in the early 1990s with the aim of reviving the historic atmosphere of the district.\n\nSome of the city's historic pubs and winehouses are located in the areas around İstiklal Avenue (İstiklal Caddesi) in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally \"Flower Passage\" in Turkish, or \"Cité de Péra\" in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants. The site of Çiçek Pasajı was originally occupied by the Naum Theatre, which was burned during the great fire of Pera in 1870. The theatre was frequently visited by Sultans Abdülaziz and Abdülhamid II, and hosted Giuseppe Verdi's play \"Il Trovatore\" before the opera houses of Paris. After the fire of 1870, the theatre was purchased by the local Greek banker Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi, and architect Kleanthis Zannos designed the current building, which was called \"Cité de Péra\" or \"Hristaki Pasajı\" in its early years. \"Yorgo'nun Meyhanesi\" (Yorgo's Winehouse) was the first winehouse to be opened in the passage. In 1908 the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sait Paşa purchased the building, and it became known as the Sait Paşa Passage. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, many impoverished noble Russian women, including a Baroness, sold flowers here. By the 1940s the building was mostly occupied by flower shops, hence the present Turkish name \"Çiçek Pasajı\" (Flower Passage). Following the restoration of the building in 1988, it was reopened as a galleria of pubs and restaurants.\n\n\"Pano\", established by Panayotis Papadopoulos in 1898, and the neighbouring \"Viktor Levi\", established in 1914, are among the oldest winehouses in the city and are located on Kalyoncu Kulluk Street near the British Consulate and Galatasaray Square. \"Cumhuriyet Meyhanesi\" (literally \"Republic Winehouse\"), renamed in the early 1930s but originally established in the early 1890s, is another popular historic winehouse and is located in the nearby Sahne Street, along with the \"Hazzopulo Winehouse\", established in 1871, inside the \"Hazzopulo Pasajı\" which connects Sahne Street and Meşrutiyet Avenue. The famous \"Nevizade Street\", which has rows of historic pubs next to each other, is also in this area. Other historic pubs are found in the areas around \"Tünel Pasajı\" and the nearby \"Asmalımescit Street\". Some historic neighbourhoods around İstiklal Avenue have recently been recreated, such as \"Cezayir Street\" near Galatasaray High School, which became known as \"La Rue Française\" and has rows of francophone pubs, cafés and restaurants playing live French music. \"Artiste Terasse\" (Artist Teras) on Cezayir Street is a popular restaurant-bar which offers panoramic views of the Hagia Sophia, Topkapı Palace, Sultan Ahmed Mosque and Galata Tower.\n\nThroughout Beyoğlu, there are many night clubs for all kinds of tastes. \"Babylon\" and \"Nu Pera\" are among the most popular European style night clubs and restaurants in the district, while \"Kemancı\" plays rock, hard rock and heavy metal. \"Maksim\" plays Oriental music, while \"Andon\" is a place where one can eat, drink and dance to the traditional Turkish music called \"fasıl\". There are restaurants on the top of historic buildings with a view of the city, such as \"360\". \"Asmalımescit Street\" has rows of traditional Turkish restaurants and \"Ocakbaşı\" (grill) houses, while the streets around the historic \"Balıkpazarı\" (Fish Market) is full of eateries offering seafood like fried mussels and calamari along with beer or rakı, or the traditional \"kokoreç\". Beyoğlu also has many elegant \"pasaj\" (passages) from the 19th century, most of which have historic and classy chocolateries and patisseries, such the \"Markiz Pastanesi\", along with many shops lining their alleys. There is also a wide range of fast-food restaurants in the district, of international chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, etc.; as well as local Turkish chains, such as \"Simit Sarayı\" which serves simit (sesame-covered, ring-shaped pretzel bread) along with cheese and tea, or individual eateries such as döner kebab houses.\n\nApart from the hundreds of shops lining the streets and avenues of the district, there is also a business community. \"Odakule\", a 1970s high rise building (the first \"structural expressionism\" style building in Turkey) is the headquarters of \"İstanbul Sanayi Odası (ISO)\" (Istanbul Chamber of Industry) and is located between İstiklal Avenue and Tepebaşı, next to the Pera Museum. Most of the upper floors of the buildings in Beyoğlu are office space, and small workshops are found on the side streets.\n\nIstanbul Modern, located near Karaköy Port on the Bosphorus, frequently hosts the exhibitions of renowned Turkish and foreign artists.\n\nPera Museum exhibits some of the works of art from the late Ottoman period, such as the \"Kaplumbağa Terbiyecisi\" (Turtle Trainer) by Osman Hamdi Bey. Apart from its permanent collection, the museum also hosts visiting exhibitions, which included the works of renowned artists such as Rembrandt.\n\nDoğançay Museum, Turkey's first contemporary art museum dedicated to the works of a single artist, officially opened its doors to the public in 2004. While the museum almost exclusively displays the works of its founder Burhan Doğançay, a contemporary artists, one floor has been set aside for the works of the artist's father, Adil Doğançay.\n\nHotel Pera Palace was built in the district in 1892 for hosting the passengers of the Orient Express. Agatha Christie wrote the novel \"Murder on the Orient Express\" in this hotel. Her room is conserved as a museum.\n\nS. Antonio di Padova, the largest Catholic church in Turkey, and the Neve Shalom Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Turkey, are also in Beyoğlu. There are other important Catholic and Orthodox churches in the area, such as the Saint Mary Draperis church or centrally located Hagia Triada Church at the conjunction point between Istiklal Avenue and Taksim Square. It is the seat of the Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Diyarbakir.\n\nThe only Jewish Museum of Turkey, which has been converted from a synagogue, is located in the Karaköy quarter, which was known as Galata in the medieval period.\n\nİstiklal Avenue is also located in the historic Beyoğlu (Pera) district. The famous street with shops, cafes, cinemas and other venues stretches for 1.4 kilometres (0.87 mi) and hosts up to 3 million people each day. \n\nPrimary and secondary schools in the district:\n\nUniversities:\n\nThe original campus of the Ottoman Imperial School of Medicine, established in 1827, was in Galatasaray, Pera. After a fire in 1848 it temporarily moved to the Golden Horn.\n\nLycée Saint-Joseph, Istanbul was in Pera after its establishment; its official founding year is 1870.\n\nBeyoğlu is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

Originally the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway (which later became part of the Midland Railway) used a terminus station roughly on the site of the current Gloucester station car park.\n\nIn 1896 a new through station was constructed on the Tuffley Loop line on a site that had previously housed the Midland Railway engine shed. The station, originally known simply as \"Gloucester\", opened on 12 April 1896; it had three through platforms and one bay. It was sharply curved and featured a main entrance building as well as buildings on both platforms. Buildings were of typical Midland Railway design in red brick with terracotta decoration. Extensive cast-iron and glass ridge-and-furrow awnings covered the platforms. There was a direct footbridge connection to the ex-Great Western Railway Gloucester Central station.\nFollowing Nationalisation, the station was renamed \"Gloucester Eastgate\" on 17 September 1951, to distinguish it from the nearby ex-GWR station, .\nAfter 1968, the station was rationalised. The island platform was lengthened at the southern end and the tracks were removed from the other two platforms. The extensive goods yard and sidings were also lifted at this time. Colour-light track-circuit block signalling was installed, and the station was effectively merged with Gloucester Central.\n\nEastgate station was closed on 1 December 1975, along with the Tuffley Loop. This was partly an attempt by British Rail to cut maintenance costs and partly a result of pressure from the road lobby and local councillors who wanted to rid Gloucester of four of its level crossings. Services that had previously called at Eastgate now had to perform a reversal at Central station, an operational inconvenience that has led to fewer trains calling at Gloucester. As the rebuilt Gloucester Central station was not completed until 1977, the administrative offices on Eastgate station lingered on in use for nearly two more years until demolition came in 1977. The site is now an Asda supermarket. Only a very few traces of the former Tuffley Loop can now be found.\n\n"}

His tomb and shrine is located in southern Iraq, and is different from the one announced destroyed by the ISIS terrorists in 2014. However, another shrine for him is located in the Al Rifa'i Mosque in Egypt.\n\nShaikh Ahmed er-Rifai was born in Hasen Region of Wasit, Iraq, during the first half of Recep of lunar months. When he was seven years old, his father Sayyid Sultan Ali el-Betaihi died in Baghdad. After that his uncle Sayyid Mansur ar-Rabbani el-Betaihi took under his protection and educated him.\n\nHe learnt the Quran from Shaikh Abd üs-Semi el-Hurbuni in Hasen, his birthplace. He committed to memorizing the whole of the Quran at the age of seven. During the same year after the death of his father, his uncle Mansur el-Betaihi transferred him and his family to Dikla region. There, his uncle sent him to Ebul Fadl Ali el-Vasiti who was an expert in the canon law of Islam, a commentator on the Quran and a preacher.\n\nOn the other hand, when he was attending dhikr meetings of his uncle Shaikh Mansur er-Rabbani, he was also attending the courses of his other uncle Shaikh Ebubekir who was a major scientific figure at the time. He memorized the book \"Tenbih\" concerning Fikh (Muslim canonical jurisprudence) of Imam Shafi which belongs to Imam Ebu Ishak Sirazi. He also wrote an explanation about such book (this explanation was lost during the Mongol invasions however).\n\nHe dedicated his entire time to learning such religious knowledge to such an extent that eventually even his teachers respected him.\n\nWhen he was twenty, Ebu Fadl Ali, the Sheikh of Wasit province and his teacher, awarded him a \"Sehadetname\" (which represented writings of evidences including canonical law and order of dervish sciences), and a nickname that was the father of external and interior sciences, and also dressed him in his own dervish's cloak.\n\nHe stayed in Nehr-i Dikla for a short time and after that he came back to his father's public guest-house for travelers at Hasen during which time he became very famous. When he was twenty-eight, his uncle Shaikh Mansur bequeathed him to manage the dervish lodge and Caliphs after his death. He also commanded him to live in dervish lodge of Shaikh Yahya en-Neccari who was his grandfather from his mother side. It was during this time he began to preach in this dervish lodge. His uncle died in the year of the bequeathing. When he was thirty-five, the number of his murids was over seven hundred thousand.\n\nHe did not neglect teaching the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and the details of the Quran to the public as he always believed that the trade of a wise man was to show the way towards God.\n\nHe gave courses in hadith, canonical jurisprudence, religious precepts and commentary on the Quran (Tafsir) everyday except for Monday and Thursday. He sat in his pulpit afternoons on Monday and Thursday and preached to intellectuals and the public.\n\nThere is an information in the book which is called \"Sevad ul-Ayneyn\" of Imam Rafii. The writer says that:\n\n\"Shaikh Salih Yusuf Ebu Zekeriya el-Askalani, who was a great expert in the canon law of Islam, had told me that: I had gone to Ummi Abide to visit Shaikh Ahmed er-Rifai. More than one hundred thousand people crowded around the guesthouse, some people were managers, scientists, sheikhs and the other members of the public. He provided dinner to all of them and was very friendly to everyone. He started to preach in the afternoon of a Thursday. Preachers of Wasit province, a religious community from doctors of Muslim theology of Iraq and the important people of the province attended the preach meeting. One group of them asked for science of commentary on the Koran, the other group asked for subjects interested with record of sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, the other group asked for Muslim canonical jurisprudence, another group asked for the disagreement between the different religious opinion, and the other groups asked too many questions about different sections of science. He answered more than two hundred questions, and he experienced no anger during his answering of questions. I became embarrassed because of the insensitiveness of people asking questions, and I stood up and said them that; \"Is this not enough for you? He will answer all questions about the written sciences, not facing any difficulty, with the permission of Allah.\" Because of my words he smiled and said to me that; \"Ebu Zekeriya allow them to ask before they lose me. Certainly the world is a house which will become absent. Allah changes whole situations every time.\" The people cried because of his answer. The meeting was confused, worried sounds were heard. Forty thousands people became students of him with the spiritual effect of his talk.\"\n\nAhmad Rifai's talks, his moves, his behaviors and his every breath were for Allah. He had got always a smiling face and he was modest, good-tempered, enduring suffering, very patient. He didn’t become cross with anyone and didn’t want any help for his own personality. On the contrary, he loves for Allah, and anger for Allah. He doesn’t rebuke somebody who behave that he doesn’t like. He doesn’t see his family and himself superior to other people. Even he said about this subject that; \"According to our opinion for Allah, everybody is equal to each other, it doesn’t matter they are close relative or unknown people for us.\"\n\nHe used to want from people protect themselves overusing the things that neither recommended nor forbidden by religious law like that overeating and oversleeping. He used to recommend doing worship during the nights. He also used to recommend being far away from people who doesn't know their limit, behave in excessive manner, see themselves superior to others and dispute each other.\n\nHe used to do his service by himself, repair his shoes, carry the firewood prepared for him to the house of people who are sick, orphan, fallen and without relations or friends.\n\nHe used to turn shoes of blinds, and also take away them to the place that they want to go. He used to respect old people and recommend respecting them.\n\nHe used to go to the house of leprous and bedridden people, wash their clothes, bring their meal, sit and eat with them, and wanted them to pray for him. When he heard a patient in his city in a far city, he used to visit them. He also cure the wounded animals, and he said that; \"To compass the creatures of Allah is one of the reasons that human being are close to Allah.\"\n\nHe used to behave very mercifully to orphans, cry for poor people, grow merry with their joy, behave with them with modesty, see himself like one of them and say in meetings that; \"If a whole craft owner is a count and every craft owner passes in groups, I prefer to become a poor in the groups of poor.\"\n\nGreat people of his era said that; \"The most important reasons of reaching his great place is his great mercy to all creatures and his looking self down to himself.\"\n\nHe used to respect the wise and experts in the canon law of Islam and wanted everybody to respect them by teaching that; \"The wise are the leaders and fundamentals of the community.\"\n\nHe had withdrawn from world. He did not store any commodity at any time. Although he possessed big wealth, he did not wear two sets of clothes at the same time, neither in the summer nor in the winter. His movable and immovable property was much more than property of governors and famous rich men. He used to distribute the revenue of his real estate to dervishes and people who come to dervish convent. He did not leave any commodities to his children.\"\n"}

Kjell was the first distributor for Jaguar on the west coast and one of the founders of the San Francisco Auto Show.\n\nAlejandro de Tomaso, an Italian car manufacturer with Argentine roots, had chosen the Biguà to revive his brand. The car was designed by Marcello Gandini, a designer for Lamborghini and Maserati. The Biguà was shown for the first time in 1996, in Geneva.\n\nFinancial troubles forced De Tomaso to look for a business partner whom he found in the American Bruce Qvale, an importer and distributor of a number of exclusive cars in the United States. The De Tomaso Biguà was renamed the Mangusta, a historic name \"(see De Tomaso Mangusta)\".\n\nAs the first cars were about to be delivered, Qvale and De Tomaso parted ways. Qvale took over the factory and the car's production. De Tomaso, however, refused to allow the use of his name. The first Mangustas were delivered to their customers with De Tomaso badges, which subsequently had to be exchanged at the dealers for the now-official Qvale logos.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Qvale built 284 cars, the majority of which were exported to the USA. The lack of a well-known brand name, the slowing economy, and the unusual design made marketing the car difficult. In 2003, Qvale sold the rights to the Mangusta to Britain's MG Rover Group.\n\nIn 2004, MG launched the MG SV and SVR. Designed by MGSR (MG Sport & Racing, the racing division of the MG Rover Group), the SV was based on the structure, suspension, engine and gearbox of the Mangusta. The car was built largely in Italy, with some fitting and pre-delivery customisation in the UK.\n\n"}

It is accessible from the D.100 that runs from the Istanbul airport to the Asian side of the city, covers 5% of Istanbul's land area and is home to over 570,000 people. Bahçelievler is the northern neighbour of Bakırköy, with a similar area.\n\nStone quarried in Bahçelievler was employed to build the old city of Constantinople. Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the area was largely farmland occupied predominately by ethnic Greeks. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic in the 1920s, Bahçelievler emerged from settlements built alongside roads stretching out from the center of the province towards Europe -first the Londra Asfalt, and the later E5, built in the 1960s. Factories were built alongside the roads, followed by dense housing and apartment buildings. The population of Bahçelievler grew from 8,500 in 1960 to 100,000 in 1975 and today nearly half a million people are packed into 16.7 km.\n\nIn the 1970s part of the area was built to plan, and -until the 1980s- Bahçelievler was indeed full of houses with gardens, as its name suggests. During the rapid economic growth of Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s most of these houses were pulled down, sold to developers, and replaced with apartment blocks- with far less green space between them; today the name Bahçelievler only accurately describes the central Bahçelievler District.\n\nSome districts of Bahçelievler – such as Bahçelievler, Basın Sitesi and Yayla – are well lit, with tree-lined avenues of attractive buildings and small parks, big shopping centers, cinemas and many small cafés. Traffic in these districts is congested, despite efforts undertaken in 2006 to relieve pressure with new roads, bridges and underpasses.\n\nOutlying districts such as Yenibosna or Soğanlı consist largely of factories, retail and small businesses (including many textile wholesalers), intermixed with extremely dense housing (typically, 6–8-story apartment buildings packed together in long rows) and run through with arterial roads. The infrastructure is poor, and the narrow streets are often choked with traffic.\n\nThere are branches of four universities, many public and private schools and hospitals. Prominent landmarks include the Unverdi shopping center (on the site of the old Unverdi cinema, in the center of the district) and the Omur Patisserie/Café on the E5 at the entrance to Bahçelievler. In 2009, a large Carrefour supermarket opened on the E5 at Şirinevler.\n\nBahçelievler is accessible via bus, minibus, dolmuş (share taxi), or car, primarily from the E5 highway, and municipal train. Transit duration depends on the hour, but has been greatly reduced with the introduction of dedicated Metrobus lanes; typical times from the major hubs in Eminönü and Mecidiyeköy run from 35–15 minutes, respectively, and under an hour to the Söğütlüçeşme Metrobus hub in Kadıköy. Atatürk International Airport is 10 minutes away by municipal train. Expedient crossing to Asia is available by sea-bus from the adjacent municipality of Bakırköy, with connections to Kadıköy and Bostancı.\n"}

The quarter is densely populated, has a residential character and is inhabited by an upper middle class population. The municipality of Bakırköy is much larger than the quarter and also includes several other neighbourhoods, such as Yeşilköy, Yeşilyurt, Ataköy. Bakırköy lies between the highway (locally known as E-5) and the coast of the Sea of Marmara. Bakırköy has a large psychiatric hospital called \"Bakırköy Ruh ve Sinir Hastalıkları Hastanesi\", and is an important shopping and commercial center.\n\nDuring the Byzantine times Bakırköy was a separate community outside Constantinople, a well-watered pleasant seaside retreat from the city, and was called Hebdomon (, \"the Seventh\", i.e. seven Roman miles from the Milion, the mile-marker monument of Constantinople). Here - where nowadays the Ataköy Marina lies - the Emperor Valens built one of the two Imperial Palaces bearing the name of \"Magnaura\", while Justinian erected another Palace named \"Jucundianae\", also placed near the seaside. Two churches, dedicated respectively to St. John the Evangelist and to St. John Baptist the Forerunner, the latter hosting the head of the Saint and burial place of the Emperor Basil II, were also erected here.\n\nHebdomon was a place of exercise and concentration of the Thracian army. It had a large Field of Mars, the \"Kampos tou Tribounaliou\" () in Latin \"Campus Tribunalis\", where several Emperors were elected through acclamation by the army. Among them were Valens, Arcadius, Honorius, Theodosius II, Phocas, Nikephoros II Phokas. The Campus lay in the valley of \"Veli Efendi\", where now the horse race course is placed. The imperial court came often to the Hebdomon to attend military parades, to welcome the emperor coming back from campaign, and to pray in the large church of St. John Baptist the Forerunner.\n\nLater the place was also named Makrohori ( \"long village\"), which was adapted to Makriköy ( \"village\") in the Ottoman period, when many large houses were built here. In 1925 the ancient denomination was changed to Bakırköy (\"Copper village\") by imposition of a law which suppressed all place names of non-Turkish origin. It was a district in Beyoğlu province between 1923 and 1926 and the district was also included present ones of Avcılar, Bağcılar, Bahçelievler, Başakşehir, Esenler, Güngören, Küçükçekmece, western boroughs of Zeytinburnu and small part of Arnavutköy before 1957. It was the biggest district of Turkey before separation of Küçükçekmece one (Avcılar was included in and became the district in 1992) in 1987 and ones of Bağcılar, Bahçelievler and Güngören in 1992. Later Esenler district was formed from some boroughs from Bağcılar and Güngören in 1994 and Başakşehir one formed from some boroughs from Büyükçekmece (Bahçeşehir area), Esenler and Küçükçekmece in 2009. Also small area around villages of Şamlar part of newly founded Arnavutköy district.\n\nThere is little remaining of historical significance in the area: what there is includes a cistern (Fildamı Sarnıcı), a powder house from the 17th century (today used as \"Yunus Emre Kültür Merkezi\" in Ataköy), the Greek Orthodox church of Saint George (consecrated on May 2, 1832) and a Greek school, the central mosque and fountain of 1875, an Armenian Church and school and the resting place of the Muslim saint Zuhurat Baba, a Turkish soldier who died during the conquest of Constantinople. His resting place is often visited by women on Fridays. The seafront is now a popular location for tea gardens, clubs and restaurants, (although the beaches have been unusable for decades).\n\nBakırköy became a popular residential area in the late 19th century after the construction of a railroad connection to İstanbul and until the 1970s was one of the most relaxed and desirable locations in the city. It is still populated by Istanbul's upper middle-class (tradespeople, bureaucrats, the retired).\n\nSome parts of Bakırköy are very pleasant residential areas, particularly the streets from the hospital downwards to the sea. The planned satellite town of Ataköy to the west of Bakırköy centre is very tidy indeed, and was one of Turkey's first planned residential developments. Ataköy contains much social infrastructure including the Galleria shopping center and yacht marina.\nThe centre of Bakırköy is an important commercial district. There is a huge shopping district (including a number of huge shiny shopping centres as Carousel), a range of cinemas, bars and cafés, as well as conversion of streets to pedestrian malls.\n\nBakırköy is easy to reach by public transport; there are dolmusues to Beyoğlu throughout the night; there are buses to Mecidiyeköy (although using the highway by bus is unpleasant indeed: there is a ferry boat service that takes passengers to Kadıköy and Bostancı on the Asian side of the city and also to the Adalar (Islands); and the light-railway from the airport to Aksaray runs through here. Moreover, the quarter has a station of the suburban railway line between Sirkeci and Halkalı.\n\nBuilt in 1913, Veliefendi Race Course, Turkey's largest and oldest modern horse-racing track (not including the ancient hippodromes in Turkey), is in close proximity.\n\nIstanbul's largest mental hospital is in Bakırköy, and the parkland surrounding it is the largest green space in the district.\n\nThere is a popular belief that the underground water of Bakırköy comes from the river Danube.\n\nBeing near the Fault in the Sea of Marmara, Bakırköy is vulnerable to earthquake damage.\n\nThe headquarters of Turkish Airlines are on the grounds of Istanbul Atatürk Airport in Yeşilköy in Bakırköy. Borajet also has its head office in Yeşilköy.\n\n\n\n\nThe neighbourhood association football team is called Bakırköyspor, once one of top teams in the country, currently a local lower league outfit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1810526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810526", "title": "Şişli", "text": "Şişli\n\nŞişli () is one of the 39 districts of Istanbul, Turkey. Located on the European side of the city, it is bordered by Beşiktaş to the east, Sarıyer to the north, Eyüp and Kağıthane to the west, and Beyoğlu to the south. In 2009, Şişli had a population of 316,058.\n\nUntil the 1800s, Şişli was open countryside, used for hunting, agriculture and leisure. It was developed as a middle class residential district during the last years of the Ottoman Empire and the early years of the Turkish Republic (the late 19th-early 20th centuries). French culture was an important influence in this period and the wide avenues of Şişli were lined with large stone buildings with high ceilings and art nouveau wrought-iron balconies, and which often had little elevators on wires in the middle of the stairways. This trading middle-class was composed of Jews, Greeks and Armenians, as well as some Turks, many of whom built homes in Şişli after a large fire devastated the neighbouring district of Pera (now Beyoğlu) in 1870. To this day, several families from Istanbul's local Armenian community live in the Kurtuluş neighbourhood of Şişli. The area was also popular with the Levantine trading families of this period who settled in Istanbul for trade or were contracted by the Ottoman Empire. Şişli attracted migrants from former possessions in Greece and the Balkans. In the late 19th century, Şişli was one of the first areas supplied with tramlines, electricity and natural gas. The Darülaceze orphanage and the large Şişli Etfal Hospital were built here in this period, as well as the French schools of St. Michel and Notre Dame de Sion. \n\nFollowing the founding of the Turkish Republic in the 1920s, larger and larger buildings were built along wide avenues such as Halaskargazi Caddesi, the main road that runs through the middle of Şişli, with its little arcades of shops below tall buildings of apartments and offices. In the republican era, the area was still the residence of the middle-class, as well as traders there were now writers and poets and Şişli acquired theatres, cafes and other cultural amenities. The Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus was built here in the 1950s and many others followed. \n\nFrom the 1950s onwards people from Anatolia began to migrate to Istanbul in search of work. In most cases they illegally built themselves squats on unclaimed or government-owned land (see gecekondu). Some of these people settled in parts of Şişli in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the northern sections of the district, around Mecidiyeköy.\n\nNow that the wealthy elite of central Şişli have moved further out of the city, the large buildings on the grand avenues are occupied by offices, banks, and big shops. Since the 1970s most older buildings have been pulled down and replaced with newer, and perhaps less remarkable, multistory structures. The back streets are still residential, and many working-class families and students have settled here. As in most parts of Istanbul, the number of people living and working in these blocks challenges the existing infrastructure; for example, competition for parking spaces is intense, and traffic during peak hours can come to a standstill. But for the residents of Şişli, there are plenty of shops, cafés, pubs, and other amenities. Additionally, Şişli's central location to other important areas of Istanbul adds to its desirability.\n\nBeing a central area well-served with public-transport and other infrastructure, Şişli is a center of trade and shopping. The main road through Şişli up to the skyscrapers of Mecidiyeköy, Gayrettepe, Levent and beyond is now lined with office blocks. Europe's largest and the world's second largest (urban-area) shopping mall, Cevahir İstanbul, is situated here. Due to Şişli's middle-class past and the enduring quality of some neighbourhoods the area is home to many upmarket shops mainly in the stylish and charming Nişantaşı area. Parking is an enduring problem, especially in the narrow side-streets. \n\nPeople also come to Şişli for schooling; this city-centre area has some well-known high schools and a great number of \"dersane\" (preparatory courses for the annual university entrance exams), evening and weekend schools where people come to cram for university or high school entrance examinations, or to learn English. \n\nThere are many well-established cafes and restaurants, including fast-food for the students and shoppers.\n\n\nThe mayor of Şişli is Hayri İnönü from the Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is largely an industrial area with a population of 380,000. The mayor is Hasan Akgün (CHP).\n\nThe land around this inlet of the Sea of Marmara, has been settled, abandoned and resettled throughout history as army after army passed along the coast to the Bosphorus. It is thought to be the site of the Greek colony on the Marmara shore called Athyra (), also known as Athyras. \n\nIn 443 AD, the armies of Attila the Hun took this settlement and its associated fort, and this was presumably his last conquest of that campaign before turning around.\n\nThe earliest mention of the bishopric of Athyra in a list of dioceses is of the late 15th century, but a seal has been found of a 10th-century Bishop Orestes of the see. No longer a residential bishopric, Athyra is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nThe Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built a bridge to cross the mouth of the inlet (Lake Büyükçekmece) and there are ruins of inns and caravansarai, which show this was a stopping place on the road to Europe. At the beginning of the Ottoman period, it was empty forest and farmland, and has gradually been settled by Turkish people migrating in from the Balkans and the Caucasus.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman population statistics of 1914, the kaza of Büyükçekmece had a total population of 13.121, consisting of 9.511 Greeks, 3.255 Muslims, 195 Bulgarians, 143 Roma people and 17 Armenians.\n\nIn the early years of the Turkish Republic, it was still very rural, with village cottages, farmland behind, and by the sea the odd weekend home for people of Istanbul. The area was a very popular day or weekend trip from the city, there is a sandy shoreline, a long seafront and until the 1970s families would come out to Büyükçekmece for fishing, crabbing or for a day on the beach.\n\nThe area administered by Büyükçekmece includes a large hinterland behind the Marmara shore, some of it still rural.\n\nLake Büyükçekmece was connected to the sea until it was separated by a dam to supply fresh water to Istanbul. The Mimar Sinan Bridge is located in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Line 1 is elevated. Line 2 is half a subway and half elevated. It is the newest of Mexico's metro systems, with operation beginning in 1991. , the system operated 40 high-floor electric trains, along a total system of 31 stations with a length of . As of June 2018, Line 3 is under construction.\n\nThe Monterrey Metro, officially known as Metrorrey has two lines with 31 stations.\n\nLine 1 opened on April 25 of 1991 and has 19 stations, it runs through the center of the city from the north-west to the eastern part of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area. Built as an long line, it runs parallel to the former 1887 Topo Chico tramline and is grade-separated as it runs on an elevated structure. A complete ride along this line takes about 27 minutes.\n\nLine 2 has 13 stations and is long, it is also fully grade-separated, partially on an elevated structure and partially underground, running from the center of the city towards the north. The first long underground segment opened on November 30 of 1994 with 6 stations, with the possibility of transferring to Line 1 at Cuauhtémoc station. In 2005 construction began on an expansion to the line with a total investment of US$200 million. Said expansion comprised 2 phases, the first one being ( of it underground) long, it opened on October 31 of 2007 adding 3 more stations to the line. The second phase added another of elevated railway along the center of the Universidad avenue and 4 more stations, it was inaugurated on October 9 of 2008 by Nuevo León Governor Natividad González Parás and Mexican president Felipe Calderón. \n\nConstruction is in progress for a third rail line (Linea 3). Early in 2018, the state of Nuevo Leon signed a funding agreement to provide 600 million pesos to Metrorrey for continued construction on Linea 3. Up to that period, Metrorrey reported total expenditures on Linea 3 of over 10 billion pesos. The transit agency claims it will be spending these funds for viaducts, and station features, such as awnings, elevators, and escalators. , construction for Linea 3 is complete, according to the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), the federal transportation agency. However, state government officials state that service is not available because the rolling stock has not been delivered. Estimated delivery for twenty-six rail cars is December 2020, and after the rail cars arrive they will need to be tested on the tracks, further delaying the start of service on the line. Linea 3 covers runs a total distance of 7.5 kilometers, part of which is underground and part is elevated. The line is supported by eight rail stations.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics, Metrorrey's two lines transported 180.8 million passengers in 2018, which corresponds to an average daily ridership of 495,000 passengers.\n\nThe following are the travel fares :\n\n\nMetrorrey also offered \"Boletos Multiviaje\" (multitrip tickets) until 2016. These tickets were intended for recurrent users and they are sold in denominations ranging from 15 to 85 trips.\n\nSince the opening of the extension of the Line 2, Metrorrey began offering the \"Mia\" Card, a rechargeable card that can be loaded with multiple trip credits. The \"Mia\" card can be initially purchased for MXN20 (~USD0.97) and can be recharged in increments ranging from MXN1 to MXN100. (~USD0.05 to ~USD4.83) Also, every MXN4, are added MXN0.50.\n\nOn May 16, 2009, Nuevo León governor Natividad González Parás announced that Metrorrey would be free for the following 60 days, as part of a program to reduce the effects of the economic downturn on citizens.\n\nThe Metrorrey system uses 84 high-floor articulated vehicles, used to form two- or three-car trainsets each, with the possibility of forming up to four-car trainsets. The MM-93 cars have an air-conditioning system. The first 23 cars were manufactured in 1990 by the Mexican government-owned Concarril (the National Railway Car Manufacturing Company) and the next 25 in 1992–93 by the Canadian company Bombardier, after it acquired Concarril in 1992, all 48 of these cars being built at a factory in Ciudad Sahagún, Mexico, and the two batches being \"nearly identical\". Those 48 cars were followed by 22 that were built in Spain by CAF, with the remaining 14 vehicles built by Bombardier. Specifically, Metrorrey ordered 25 two-section MM-90 cabs in 1988, and 23 MM-90/2F cabs in 1990 from Bombardier for Line 1; the latter type represents the second generation of the same vehicle equipped with high-tech components, including, among other things, asynchronous traction motors with the power supplied by catenary. The MM-93 cab, debuted during the opening of the Line 2, including full-closed windows, and an air-conditioning system, and following the expansion of Line 2, Metrorrey adquired 16 cabs based in an evolution of MM-90 / MM-90/2F cab.\n\nIn 2019, Metrorrey bought 24 former Frankfurt U-Bahn Type U3 trains, which were withdrawn from U-Bahn service in 2017. The trains were built by DUEWAG in 1979 and 1980, and will undergo a refurbishment programme by Talbot Services to extend their service life by 20 years.\n\nMetrorrey also has a bus system that uses exclusive and obligatory stops along its route.\nIt has nine lines. On Metrorrey Line 1 there are four Transmetro lines, three in Talleres station and one in Exposición station. On Line 2 there are five more Transmetro lines, two at San Nicolas (Santo Domingo and Las Puentes) and three more at Sendero (Montreal, Fomerrey, and Apodaca).\nThere is no additional fee, other than the standard Metro Ticket, to use Transmetro.\n\nIn July 2014, a contract was signed with CAF for 26 trains to run on Line 3. It is expected to open when the refurbished trains arrive at the end of 2020.\n\n\n"}

Across the inlet is the district of Avcılar and the campus of Istanbul University. The inlet is connected to the Sea of Marmara by a very narrow channel so the water is not salty. The streams running into the inlet now carry industrial waste and the inlet is highly polluted but efforts are being made to clean it. There used to be wildlife and many kinds of birds and efforts to get the wildlife back are taking effect slowly.\n\nThe lagoon has almost always been controlled by whichever imperial power was in control of Istanbul as the Via Egnatia (the road from Constantinopolis/Istanbul to western Europe) passed by here.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Küçükçekmece had a total population of 17.975, consisting of 10.945 Greeks, 5.340 Muslims, 1.396 Armenians, 61 Catholics, 31 Latins, 15 Bulgarians and 187 foreign citizens.\n\nUntil the 1950s Küçükçekmece was a popular weekend excursion, people would come by train from Istanbul to swim, fish for eels or just sit by the water, while children played in the woods.\n\nHowever the land here is flat, rising slightly away from the shore, and as such is easily built upon so as bigger and bigger roads have been built the area has become industrial and crowded with huge housing projects. This development is still going on and is indeed accelerated as the TEM motorway to Europe passes through here now. The İkitelli area in particular is very industrial and still more factories are being built. The Nuclear Energy Research center is on the lake side.\n\nAlready during the Greek and Roman periods the site of Küçükçekmece has been inhabited. The ruins of this town, always remained visible, have been studied extensively in 1930 by the Swiss archeologist Ernest Mamboury, who - basing upon ancient sources - identified the settlement with the town of Regium (Ρήγιον in Greek). In 2009 a new identification has been proposed, this time with the Greek and Roman city of Bathonea. Excavations are presently carried on under the direction of Dr. Şengül Aydıngün, an associate Professor of the Kocaeli University.\n\nThe settlement lies 20 km west from Istanbul. The site is eight kilometers wide, reaching a small inlet west of Istanbul on the banks of Lake Küçükçekmece. Some remains of this city could be submerged in the waters of this lake. A researcher found in the middle of the lake a lighthouse that belongs to the settlement. If this is verified, it'll represent one of just three Roman lighthouses known to have existed in the eastern Mediterranean, next to those at Alexandria and Patara.\n\nThe population of Küçükçekmece is growing fast and it is acquiring schools, supermarkets, shopping centres and other facilities. However, in most parts of Küçükçekmece this is very much a poor, working-class neighbourhood, with much crime in dirty streets where men gather in badly lit cafes to play cards, drink tea and smoke cheap cigarettes. Most of the housing is illegally built gecekondu. Most of the people are recent migrants from Anatolia, increasingly from the troubled south-east. Traditionally there has been much left-wing sympathy, but recently it seems changing to the central right-wing.\n\nAt sunset after walking by the lakeside, young people will find somewhere to sit, and they will drink Turkish tea, that is one of the bests Küçükçekmece offers.\n\nKüçükçekmece, Başakşehir, Bağcılar, Gaziosmanpaşa, Esenler, Bayrampaşa, Zeytinburnu, and Fatih are home to refugees of Syrian origin.\n\nA historic bridge, built by Ottoman architect Sinan, crosses the mouth of the lagoon. The bridge has been restored and is well maintained.\n\nThe 1911-founded football club Küçükçekmece S.K. play in the \nIstanbul First Amateur League.\n\nThe Sirkeci-Halkalı railway line passes through Küçükçekmece district serving the railway stations Küçükçekmece, Soğuksu, Kanarya and Halkalı.\n\nNeighborhoods are Atakent, Atatürk, Beşyol, Cennet, Cumhuriyet, Fatih, Fevzi Çakmak, Gültepe, Halkalı Merkez, İnönü, İstasyon, Kanarya, Kartaltepe, Kemalpaşa, Mehmet Akif, Söğütlüçeşme, Sultanmurat, Tevfikbey, Yarımburgaz, Yenimahalle, Yeşilova.\n\n"}

Examples of his politics in \"Free Air\" are found in Lewis's emphasis on the heroic role played by the book's protagonist, Milt Dagget, a working class everyman type. Conversely, Lewis presents nearly every upper-class character in Claire Boltwood's world (including her railroad-mogul father) as snobby elitists. The story also champions the democratic nature of the automobile versus the more aristocratic railroad travel. Lewis's emphasis on the freedom which automobiles would eventually give the working and middle classes bolsters the egalitarian, democratic aesthetic. \"Free Air\" is one of the first novels about the road trip, a subject around which the Beats (most notably Jack Kerouac) would build a cult following in the mid-20th century.\n\nComposer Ferde Grofe used the novel as the basis for the music to his adventurous composition \"Free Air.\"\n\nIn the HBO series \"Boardwalk Empire\", set initially in 1920, Jimmy and his girlfriend Pearl are reading \"Free Air\".

Honegger entitled his work a \"dramatic oratorio\", adding speaking roles and actors. The work has an important part for the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument (played at the premiere by its inventor Maurice Martenot).\n\nClaudel's dramatic frame provided Honegger with a space – between heaven and earth, past and present – where he could mix styles from the popular to the sublime. A hybrid work: partly oratorio and partly opera, Honegger uses all his musical means, monody, harmony and counterpoint to build towards sculpted blocks of sound.\n\nAt its première in Basel the piece was an immediate success, with critics almost unanimous in praising a perfect cohesion between words and music. \nOn 6 May 1939 after rehearsals at the Salle Pleyel in Paris, the work was semi-staged with designs by Alexandre Benois at the Théâtre Municipal in Orléans conducted by Louis Fourestier.\n\nThe work was heard again in Basel on 12 May 1939 and then in Zurich on 14 May. On 13 June that year at the Palais de Chaillot, it was conducted by Charles Munch (who also gave the United States premiere in New York in 1948). After the outbreak of war the work was performed at the Salle Pleyel on 22 February 1940 and in Brussels on 29 February that year. Sacher and Rubinstein made abortive plans for further performances that year, including the Lucerne Festival. On 26 February 1947 Rubinstein organised a concert performance at the Palais des Fêtes in Strasbourg, conducted by Fritz Münch (brother of Charles), which was repeated the following year on 13 June 1948 in the presence of the composer.\nThe work was first performed in Canada at the Montreal Festivals in 1953 under conductor Wilfrid Pelletier.\n\nIn December 1953, Roberto Rossellini directed a staged version of the oratorio in Italian translation at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples with Ingrid Bergman in the title role. It was subsequently performed at La Scala. Both performances received excellent reviews. Rossellini then staged it at the Paris Opera in the original French, again to critical success. He also filmed the San Carlo production in both French and Italian versions. The film was released in Italy in 1954 under the Italian title \"Giovanna d'Arco al rogo\". It proved to be a box-office failure and the French version was never released.\n\nMarion Cotillard has starred as Joan of Arc in live performances of the oratorio several times, first in 2005, in Orléans, France, with the Orléans Symphony Orchestra, directed by Jean-Pierre Loisil. In 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, with the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, directed by Marc Soustrot. In June 2015, she performed the oratorio with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall.\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

For most of the nineteenth century, the seat was held by the Whigs and (later) the Liberals until 1900 when results were initially in line with the landslide victories of the first decade of the century and then more marginal.\n\nFrom 1910-1997, Chester returned Conservative Party MPs. At most elections, majorities were in relative terms medium but the party's MPs won marginal majorities at the 1929 general election over the Liberal candidate (when the Labour Party formed a minority government) and at the 1992 general election over the Labour candidate, when the Conservatives had a small parliamentary majority.\n\nChristine Russell of the Labour Party gained the seat easily from Gyles Brandreth at the 1997 general election after 87 years of Conservative control, and retained it until 2010. Her majority over the Conservatives had been reduced to under 1,000 votes at the 2005 general election.\n\nStephen Mosley of the Conservatives gained the seat from Labour at the 2010 general election. However, Mosley narrowly lost his seat five years later to Chris Matheson of the Labour Party in 2015 by 93 votes. The 2015 general election result gave the constituency the most marginal majority (0.2%) of Labour's 232 seats won that year. Matheson was re-elected at the 2017 general election, with a significantly increased majority of 9,176 votes, it was one the largest swings to Labour in the election and is no longer considered a marginal seat. At 56.8% it is the highest share of the vote that Labour has ever had in the constituency.\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000640\n\n\n \n\nSuccession of Earl Grosvenor to the peerage as Marquess of Westminster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As well as the central market town of Chorley itself, the seat extends into southern Lancashire rural hinterland with three major villages and minor villages.\n\nChorley's expansion is assured with the building of Buckshaw Village, an urban development sprawling over the former Royal Ordnance Site east of Leyland in the seat.\n\nFollowing their review of parliamentary representation in Lancashire leading up to the 2010 United Kingdom general election the Boundary Commission for England created a new seat of Wyre and Preston North in the central part of the county, which caused \"knock-on\" effects elsewhere. Chorley constituency was one of the largest in electorate at the start of the review, which was a factor in the alterations to both its own composition and the changes to surrounding constituencies. These changes took away from the seat all the areas to the west of the M6 motorway, namely Croston, Eccleston, Bretherton and Mawdesley. These move to South Ribble.\n\nSince the 1945 general election Chorley has proved to be a bellwether, changing hands between Labour and the Conservatives; however, this pattern was broken in 2010 when Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle retained the seat against the national trend. Chorley itself is Labour's strongest seat in the area, with the rural hinterland and smaller towns and villages more inclined to vote Conservative.\n\nLindsay Hoyle has been MP for Chorley since 1997 as a member of the Labour Party. In November 2019 Hoyle was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons following the resignation of John Bercow; Sir Lindsay had been Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons under Bercow since 2010. \n\nThere is an inconsistently followed convention, which is mostly kept by the major parties, not to oppose the Speaker at elections. In keeping with this, the previously announced Liberal Democrat candidate, Paul Valentine, subsequently withdrew from the general election once Sir Lindsay was appointed Speaker. However the Green Party candidate, James Melling, confirmed that he will stand against the incumbent Speaker.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, and Labour traditionally do not stand against the sitting Speaker of the House of Commons, and consequently did not oppose Lindsay Hoyle's re-election bid. The Brexit Party did not stand an official candidate, despite the predecessor party UKIP standing against John Bercow in Buckingham in his three elections as Speaker. However, their former candidate stood as an independent, having changed his name to Mark Brexit-Smith. The Green Party do not follow the convention of standing aside for the Speaker, and also fielded a candidate in the election.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915. The political parties had been making preparations for an election to take place and by July 1914, the following candidates had been selected; \n\n\n\n\n"}

Both stood down at the 2010 general election; their joint statement cited the hectic life of politics as part of their reason for standing down, in addition to an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who concluded that they misused their MPs' expenses to pay rent for a flat that they had already bought outright.\n\n\n\n"}

From World War II until 2010 it was won by Labour candidates, generally on safe, large majorities; even Ann Widdecombe could not snatch the seat from the former leading cotton town's close affinity with Labour Party values as they stood in 1979. The closest second place was to a Conservative Party candidate, Ian Bruce, who came 787 votes (1.6%) short of taking the seat in 1983.\n\nBurnley saw strong opposition support for the Liberal Democrats in 2005 who moved into second place, meanwhile a local independent pushed Yousuf Miah, a Conservative into fourth position. Following controversy regarding outgoing Labour MP Kitty Ussher's personal expenses, Gordon Birtwistle, who first contended the seat in 1992, gained the seat in 2010 with a heavy swing of 9.6%.\n\nHowever, Birtwistle was one of the many casualties faced by the Liberal Democrats in the 2015 election, losing the seat to Julie Cooper, who had also stood as Labour's candidate in 2010, although the 6.2% swing away from Birtwistle was less than half the 15.2% national swing against his party. As in 2005, the Conservatives came fourth, behind UKIP as well as Labour and the Lib Dems this time.\n\nIn the 2017 election Labour held the seat with an increased majority. Birtwistle stood again but saw his share of the vote halved, this was widely seen to be due to his party's stance on Brexit. This was one of the biggest increases in the share of the vote for the Conservatives in the whole country, more than doubling their share of the vote. UKIP lost two-thirds of their vote from 2015 but did retain their deposit. This meant Burnley was one of the few constituencies in England where four parties retained their deposits. At the 2019 election, Antony Higginbotham won the seat for the Conservatives, thus becoming the first Conservative to represent Burnley in parliament for over 100 years. The Conservative vote share increased by over 9% compared with the previous election, while the Labour vote share declined by about 10%.\n\nThe review of parliamentary representation in Lancashire by the Boundary Commission for England in the 2000s proposed no change to the boundaries of the Burnley seat.

The Labour candidate, Dunwoody's daughter Tamsin, came a distant second. Having previously enjoyed a considerable lead in support over the Conservatives (as indicated in Gwyneth Dunwoody’s over 7,000 majority in 2005), the Labour government had lost support due to the onset of the global recession and Gordon Brown’s relatively weak image as a leader.\n\nThe by-election produced the first Conservative MP for the seat and nationally the first gain for a Conservative Party candidate at a parliamentary by-election since the Mitcham and Morden by-election in 1982 during the Falklands War, and the first from Labour since the Ilford North by-election of 1978. Timpson held the seat until 2017, where Labour's Laura Smith gained it with a narrow majority of just 48 votes, the closest margin in the seat's history and the second-narrowest Labour gain of the election (behind Kensington, at 20 votes).In the 2019 general election the conservatives regained the seat with a majority of 8,508 on a swing of 7.9% to the conservatives.\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Crewe and Nantwich wards of Acton, Alexandra, Audlem, Barony Weaver, Bunbury, Combermere, Coppenhall, Delamere, Grosvenor, Maw Green, Minshull, Peckforton, Queens Park, Ruskin Park, St Barnabas, St John's, Shavington, Waldron, Wellington, Weston Park, Willaston East, Willaston West, Wistaston, Wrenbury, and Wybunbury.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Crewe and Nantwich wards of Alexandra, Barony Weaver, Coppenhall, Delamere, Grosvenor, Haslington, Maw Green, Queens Park, Ruskin Park, St Barnabas, St John's, Shavington, Waldron, Wellington, Weston Park, Willaston East, Willaston West, Wistaston, and Wybunbury.\n\n2010–present: The Borough of Cheshire East wards of Alexandra, Barony Weaver, Birchin, Coppenhall, Delamere, Englesea, Grosvenor, Haslington, Leighton, Maw Green, St Barnabas, St John's, St Mary's, Shavington, Valley, Waldron, Wellington, Wells Green, Willaston, Wistaston Green, and Wybunbury.\n\nThe constituency was created from parts of the constituencies of Crewe and Nantwich.

The village falls under the Gop block of Puri District. It was founded before 1500 AD by Puri Gajapati Prataprudra Dev.\n\nIt is believed that, the village was settled after the famous Kanchi Vijay of Puri Gajapati Maharaja Sri Purusottam Deva. The village took his minister's name, Ganeswara Deva, in honor of him.\n\nGaneswarpur is a well known village of the famous Puri district of Odisha . It is situated between 19° 97' North Latitude 86° 01' Longitude and at an altitude of 5 fits above sea level. It is 30 km far from Puri town and 50 km from the state capital Bhubaneswar.Konark Sun Temple is just 13 kilometers from this place. The village is stretched from East to West.

The Brahmins whose heirs are since the beginning of the village are Panigrahis, Nandas, Dashs, Mohapatras, Badapandas, Hotas and Mishras. From the beginning, Lord Jagannath is being worshiped as Lord Gopaljeu in the village. It is heard for Lord Gopaljiu, these Brahmins were brought for different purposes. From some old sources it is believed that a long before the village was stretched from North to south. But due to frequent change in direction of river khusbhadra the village changed to its present form. This can be verified by 2 ponds. \"Naara gadia\" and \"Bena gadia\" which refers that queen is used to wash her hairs in these ponds. Some under ground wells n old pots also found in these areas while digging.\n\nThere are 3 main temples in the village.\n\nManchanath Mandir (Lord Shiva).\nGopaljiu Mandir.(Lord Jagannath)\nGrama Devati.\n\nThere are some more temples in the village.\nThese are\nLokanath Mandir.\nThakurani Mandir.\nPeople observe festivals through the whole year.

Bhoga is mostly \"ukhuda\",\"khai\" and \"Chudaghasa\". Half of the village celebrates festival on Dola purnima but other half celebrates the next day i.e. on Holi.Holi is widely enjoyed by the villagers with an ending ceremony that is dancing crazily. In the evening all the villagers gathered near Gopaljeu temple because of Melana and cultural festival. The next day is really interesting. This day is called as \"\"Nagagata\"\". It is an old tradition originated from Puri. But the Ganeswarpur Nagas are quite different from that of puri. They are quite big in size and very aggressive.\nApart from Dola Purnima villagers celebrate Ganesh Puja and Rama Nabami grandly with Bhajan sandhya, Parayana and Pala. Dushera is also celebrated grandly in Panigrahi family. They offer \"Upana\" to Goddess Durga.\n\nTotal area of the village almost 1 square km. Total population of the village is almost 1800.

The portraits show some similarities to some Insular manuscripts and some Court School manuscripts, as might be expected given the nationality Fridugisus, who was English, and from his connections to the Carolingian court. The portraits have been described as being \"coarsely executed\". The manuscript also contains a decorated title page and incipit page for each gospel. There are also decorated major and minor initials. The major initials are done in early Franco-Saxon style and were done by a different artist than the one who did the portraits.\n\nThe volume still has its Carolingian treasure binding dating from the ninth century. The covers were refurbished in the 14th and 19th centuries. The covers are oak panels covered in embossed silver. The front cover has the figure of a seated Christ in Majesty enclosed within a rectangular frame decorated with stones and foliate designs. The majority of the medal work is 9th century typical of mid-ninth century Carolingian metalwork. In the four corners of the frame are enamels of the four evangelist symbols, which were added in the fourteenth century. The enamels were probably produced at Limoges. The original colored stones were replaced by jewels in 1838 for Bishop Butler. There are relics of finger bones from an anonymous saint embedded on the interior of the boards. The clasps for the volume were probably replaced in the 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1810614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810614", "title": "Health equity", "text": "Health equity\n\nHealth equity arises from access to the social determinants of health, specifically from wealth, power and prestige. Individuals who have consistently been deprived of these three determinants are significantly disadvantaged from health inequities, and face worse health outcomes than those who are able to access certain resources. It is not equity to simply provide every individual with the same resources; that would be equality. In order to achieve health equity, resources must be allocated based on an individual need-based principle. \n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". The quality of health and how health is distributed among economic and social status in a society can provide insight into the level of development within that society. Health is a basic human right and human need, and all human rights are interconnected. Thus, health must be discussed along with all other basic human rights.\n\nHealth equity, sometimes also referred to as health disparity, is defined as differences in the quality of health and healthcare across different populations. Health equity is different from health equality, as it refers to the absence of disparities in controllable or remediable aspects of health. It is not possible to work towards complete equality in health, as there are some factors of health that are beyond human influence. Inequity implies some kinds of social injustice. Thus, if one population dies younger than another because of genetic differences, a non-remediable/controllable factor, we tend to say that there is a health inequality. On the other hand, if a population has a lower life expectancy due to lack of access to medications, the situation would be classified as a health inequity. These inequities may include differences in the \"presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care\" between populations with a different race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic status. Although it is important to recognize the difference in health equity and equality, having equality in health is essential to begin achieving health equity. The importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nSocioeconomic status is both a strong predictor of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations. Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the capabilities of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both financial and social capital. It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health. In the UK, prior to the institution of the NHS reforms in the early 2000s, it was shown that income was an important determinant of access to healthcare resources. Because one's job or career is a primary conduit for both financial and social capital, work is an important, yet under represented, factor in health inequities research and prevention efforts. Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore unaffordable to certain populations.\n\nIn China, for instance, the collapse of the Cooperative Medical System left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising income inequality in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.\n\nSimilarly, in Tanzania, it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider: a significant step towards stronger healthcare. Some scholars have noted that unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of \"underinvestment in social goods, such as public education and health care; disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital\".\n\nThe role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, social capital plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives. The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in social capital for those trapped in poor neighborhoods. Social interventions, which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community, are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community's health. A 1998 epidemiological study\" \"showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.\n\nUnconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty used by some programs in the developing world appear to lead to a reduction in the likelihood of being sick.<ref name=\"doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2\"></ref> Such evidence can guide resource allocations to effective interventions.\n\nResearch has shown that the quality of health care does indeed vary among different socioeconomic groups. Children in families of low socioeconomic status are the most susceptible to health inequities. \"Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes\" (2010) is a book edited by Blas and Sivasankara that includes a chapter discussing health equities among children. Gathering information from 100 international surveys, this chapter states that children in poor families under 5 years of age are likely to face health disparities because the quality of their health depends on others providing for them; young children are not capable of maintaining good health on their own. In addition, these children have higher mortality rates than those in richer families due to malnutrition. Because of their low socioeconomic status, receiving health care can be challenging. Children in poor families are less likely to receive health care in general, and if they do have access to care, it is likely that the quality of that care is not highly sufficient. \n\nEducation is an important factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don't know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment. In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%). There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds.\n\nFor some populations, access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits. Costa Rica, for example, has demonstrable health spatial inequities with 12–14% of the population living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Inequity has decreased in some areas of the nation as a result of the work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.\n\nChina experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the 1980s as a result of the degradation of the Cooperative Medical System (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations. The significant poverty experienced by rural workers (some earning less than 1 USD per day) further limits access to healthcare, and results in malnutrition and poor general hygiene, compounding the loss of healthcare resources. The loss of the CMS has had noticeable impacts on life expectancy, with rural regions such as areas of Western China experiencing significantly lower life expectancies.\n\nSimilarly, populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities. A study by Jane Falkingham noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.\n\nAlong with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts. Additionally, among African American and Latino infants, mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher than other racial groups.\n\nThere are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage, with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non-ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care. The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventive and ambulatory care. A 2010 study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the Institute of Medicine has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like: insurance status, household income, education, age, geographic location and quality of living conditions. Even when the researchers corrected for these factors, the disparities persist. Slavery has contributed to disparate health outcomes for generations of African Americans in the United States.\n\nEthnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent. A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across 11 African nations (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) was published in 2000 by the WHO. The study described the presence of significant ethnic parities in the child mortality rates among children younger than 5 years old, as well as in education and vaccine use. In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services, including healthcare based upon race and social class, and the resultant health inequities. Further, evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries. The Pygmys of Congo, for instance, are excluded from government health programs, discriminated against during public health campaigns, and receive poorer overall healthcare.\n\nIn a survey of five European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.\n\nA 1996 study of race-based health inequity in Australia revealed that Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Aborigine populations. Aborigine populations experienced 10 times greater mortality in the 30–40 age range; 2.5 times greater infant mortality rate, and 3 times greater age standardized mortality rate. Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population (16 and 15 times greater respectively), which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group. At this point in time, the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples were highest in Australia, when compared to the US, Canada and New Zealand. In South America, indigenous populations faced similarly poor health outcomes with maternal and infant mortality rates that were significantly higher (up to 3 to 4 times greater) than the national average. The same pattern of poor indigenous healthcare continues in India, where indigenous groups were shown to experience greater mortality at most stages of life, even when corrected for environmental effects.\n\nSexuality is a basis of health discrimination and inequity throughout the world. Homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and gender-variant populations around the world experience a range of health problems related to their sexuality and gender identity, some of which are complicated further by limited research.\n\nIn spite of recent advances, LGBT populations in China, India, and Chile continue to face significant discrimination and barriers to care. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that there is inadequate research data about the effects of LGBT discrimination on morbidity and mortality rates in the patient population. In addition, retrospective epidemiological studies on LGBT populations are difficult to conduct as a result of the practice that sexual orientation is not noted on death certificates. WHO has proposed that more research about the LGBT patient population is needed  for improved understanding of its  unique health needs and barriers to accessing care.\n\nRecognizing the need for LGBT healthcare research, the Director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services designated sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) as a health disparity population for NIH research in October 2016. For the purposes of this designation, the Director defines SGM as \"encompass[ing] lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations, as well as those whose sexual orientation, gender identity and expressions, or reproductive development varies from traditional, societal, cultural, or physiological norms\". This designation has prioritized research into the extent, cause, and potential mitigation of health disparities among SGM populations within the larger LGBT community.\n\nWhile many aspects of LGBT health disparities are heretofore uninvestigated, at this stage, it is known that one of the main forms of healthcare discrimination  LGBT individuals face is discrimination from healthcare workers or institutions themselves. A systematic literature review of publications in English and Portuguese from 2004–2014 demonstrate significant difficulties in accessing care secondary to discrimination and homophobia from healthcare professionals. This discrimination can take the form of verbal abuse, disrespectful conduct, refusal of care, the withholding of health information,  inadequate treatment, and outright violence. In a study analyzing the quality of healthcare for South African men who have sex with men (MSM), researchers interviewed a cohort of individuals about their health experiences, finding that MSM who identified as homosexual felt their access to healthcare was limited due to an inability to find clinics employing healthcare workers who did not discriminate against their sexuality. They also reportedly faced \"homophobic verbal harassment from healthcare workers when presenting for STI treatment\". Further, MSM who did not feel comfortable disclosing their sexual activity to healthcare workers failed to identify as homosexuals, which limited the quality of the treatment they received.\n\nAdditionally, members of the LGBT community contend with health care disparities due, in part, to lack of provider training and awareness of the population’s healthcare needs. Transgender individuals believe that there is a higher importance of providing gender identity (GI) information more than sexual orientation (SO) to providers to help inform them of better care and safe treatment for these patients. Studies regarding patient-provider communication in the LGBT patient community show that providers themselves report a significant lack of awareness regarding the health issues LGBT-identifying patients face. As a component of this fact, medical schools do not focus much attention on LGBT health issues in their curriculum; the LGBT-related topics that are discussed tend to be limited to HIV/AIDS, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n\nAmong LGBT-identifying individuals, transgender individuals face especially significant barriers to treatment. Many countries still do not have legal recognition of transgender or non-binary gender individuals leading to placement in mis-gendered hospital wards and medical discrimination. Seventeen European states mandate sterilization of individuals who seek recognition of a gender identity that diverges from their birth gender. In addition to many of the same barriers as the rest of the LGBT community, a WHO bulletin points out that globally, transgender individuals often also face a higher disease burden. A 2010 survey of transgender and gender-variant people in the United States revealed that transgender individuals faced a significant level of discrimination. The survey indicated that 19% of individuals experienced a healthcare worker refusing care because of their gender, 28% faced harassment from a healthcare worker, 2% encountered violence, and 50% saw a doctor who was not able or qualified to provide transgender-sensitive care. In Kuwait, there have been reports of transgender individuals being reported to legal authorities by medical professionals, preventing safe access to care. An updated version of the U.S. survey from 2015 showed little change in terms of healthcare experiences for transgender and gender variant individuals. The updated survey revealed that 23% of individuals reported not seeking necessary medical care out of fear of discrimination, and 33% of individuals who had been to a doctor within a year of taking the survey reported negative encounters with medical professionals related to their transgender status.\n\nThe stigmatization represented particularly in the transgender population  creates a health disparity for LGBT individuals with regard to mental health. The LGBT community is at increased risk for psychosocial distress, mental health complications, suicidality, homelessness, and substance abuse, often complicated by access-based under-utilization or fear of health services. Transgender and gender-variant individuals have been found to experience higher rates of mental health disparity than LGB individuals. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, for example, 39% of respondents reported serious psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population.\n\nThese mental health facts are informed by a history of anti-LGBT bias in health care. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) listed homosexuality as a disorder until 1973; transgender status was listed as a disorder until 2012. This was amended in 2013 with the DSM-5 when \"gender identity disorder\" was replaced with \"gender dysphoria\", reflecting that simply identifying as transgender is not itself pathological and that the diagnosis is instead for the distress a transgender person may experience as a result of the discordance between assigned gender and gender identity.\n\nLGBT health issues have received disproportionately low levels of medical research, leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBT treatment. For instance, a review of medical literature regarding LGBT patients revealed that there are significant gaps in the medical understanding of cervical cancer in lesbian and bisexual individuals it is unclear whether its prevalence in this community is a result of probability or some other preventable cause. For example, LGBT people report poorer cancer care experiences. It is incorrectly assumed that LGBT women have a lower incidence of cervical cancer than their heterosexual counterparts, resulting in lower rates of screening.  Such findings illustrate the need for continued research focused on the circumstances and needs of LGBT individuals and the inclusion in policy frameworks of sexual orientation and gender identity as social determinants of health.\n\nA June 2017 review sponsored by the European commission as part of a larger project to identify and diminish health inequities, found that LGB are at higher risk of some cancers and that LGBTI were at higher risk of mental illness, and that these risks were not adequately addressed. The causes of health inequities were, according to the review, \"i) cultural and social norms that preference and prioritise heterosexuality; ii) minority stress associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics; iii) victimisation; iv) discrimination (individual and institutional), and; v) stigma.\"\n\nBoth gender and sex are significant factors that influence health. Sex is characterized by female and male biological differences in regards to gene expression, hormonal concentration, and anatomical characteristics. Gender is an expression of behavior and lifestyle choices. Both sex and gender inform each other, and it is important to note that differences between the two genders influence disease manifestation and associated healthcare approaches. Understanding how the interaction of sex and gender contributes to disparity in the context of health allows providers to ensure quality outcomes for patients. This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health.  Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.\n\nAs sex and gender are inextricably linked in day-to-day life, their union is apparent in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males tend to have a health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, early marriage, and domestic abuse for females. In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females. The leading causes of the higher male death rate are accidents, injuries, violence, and cardiovascular diseases. In a number of countries, males also face a heightened risk of mortality as a result of behavior and greater propensity for violence.\n\nPhysicians tend to offer invasive procedures to male patients more than female patients. Furthermore, men are more likely to smoke than women and experience smoking-related health complications later in life as a result; this trend is also observed in regard to other substances, such as marijuana, in Jamaica, where the rate of use is 2–3 times more for men than women. Lastly, men are more likely to have severe chronic conditions and a lower life expectancy than women in the United States.\n\nGender and sex are also components of health disparity in the female population. The 2012 World Development Report (WDR) noted that women in developing nations experience greater mortality rates than men in developing nations. Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of maternal death than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or child mortality.\n\nWhile women in the United States tend to live longer than men, they generally are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare. Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, which can lead to higher rates of depression and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health. Women are also more likely than men to suffer from sexual or intimate-partner violence both in the United States and worldwide. In Europe, women who grew up in poverty are more likely to have lower muscle strength and higher disability in old age.\n\nWomen have better access to healthcare in the United States than they do in many other places in the world. In one population study conducted in Harlem, New York, 86% of women reported having privatized or publicly assisted health insurance, while only 74% of men reported having any health insurance. This trend is representative of the general population of the United States.\n\nIn addition, women's pain tends to be treated less seriously and initially ignored by clinicians when compared to their treatment of men's pain complaints. Historically, women have not been included in the design or practice of clinical trials, which has slowed the understanding of women's reactions to medications and created a research gap. This has led to post-approval adverse events among women, resulting in several drugs being pulled from the market. However, the clinical research industry is aware of the problem, and has made progress in correcting it.\n\nHealth disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in China, health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children. Recently, gender-based disparities have decreased as females have begun to receive higher-quality care. Additionally, a girl’s chances of survival are impacted by the presence of a male sibling; while girls do have the same chance of survival as boys if they are the oldest girl, they have a higher probability of being aborted or dying young if they have an older sister.\n\nIn India, gender-based health inequities are apparent in early childhood. Many families provide better nutrition for boys in the interest of maximizing future productivity given that boys are generally seen as breadwinners. In addition, boys receive better care than girls and are hospitalized at a greater rate. The magnitude of these disparities increases with the severity of poverty in a given population.\n\nAdditionally, the cultural practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) is known to impact women's health, though is difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a Sub-Saharan African practice, it may have roots in the Middle East as well. The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects. Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention. Long-term consequences include urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding. Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) than women who have not.\n\nMinority populations have increased exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors as well as residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to have easy access to nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods. These environmental condition have social ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives than their predecessors will.\n\nIn addition, minority neighborhoods have various health hazards that result from living close to highways and toxic waste factories or general dilapidated structures and streets. These environmental conditions create varying degrees of health risk from noise pollution, to carcinogenic toxic exposures from asbestos and radon that result in increase chronic disease, morbidity, and mortality. The quality of residential environment such as damaged housing has been shown to increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, which is reflective of a communities health. Housing conditions can create varying degrees of health risk that lead to complications of birth and long-term consequences in the aging population. In addition, occupational hazards can add to the detrimental effects of poor housing conditions. It has been reported that a greater number of minorities work in jobs that have higher rates of exposure to toxic chemical, dust and fumes.\n\nRacial segregation is another environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within the real estate industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination have been shown to have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.\n\nIndividuals living in rural areas, especially poor rural areas, have access to fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.\n\nReasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:\n\n\nHealth disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity/race which includes:\n\nCommunication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Language barriers have not only hindered appointment scheduling, prescription filling, and clear communications, but have also been associated with health declines, which can be attributed to reduced compliance and delays in seeking care, which could affect particularly refugee health in the United States.\n\nProvider discrimination occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients. This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic/racial groups. Doctors are more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients. This may occur regardless of consideration for education, income, and personality characteristics. Two types of stereotypes may be involved, automatic stereotypes or goal modified stereotypes. Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments/behaviors outside of consciousness. Goal modified stereotype is a more conscious process, done when specific needs of clinician arise (time constraints, filling in gaps in information needed) to make a complex decisions. Physicians are unaware of their implicit biases. Some research suggests that ethnic minorities are less likely than whites to receive a kidney transplant once on dialysis or to receive pain medication for bone fractures. Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.\n\nAccording to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care. For example, minorities are not regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms. Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing, flu immunizations and pap smears. In the UK, Public Health England, a universal service free at the point of use, which forms part of the NHS, offers regular screening to any member of the population considered to be in an at-risk group (such as individuals over 45) for major disease (such as colon cancer, or diabetic-retinopathy).\n\nThere are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts, some examples include:\n\n\nHealth inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of morbidity and mortality for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In Canada, the issue was brought to public attention by the LaLonde report.\n\nIn UK, the Black Report was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist at University College London, published the \"Fair Society, Healthy Lives\" report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a \"social gradient in health\": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, \"The Economist\" argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.\n\nIn June 2018, the European Commission launched the Joint Action Health Equity in Europe. Forty-nine participants from 25 European Union Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying social determinants of health across Europe. Under the coordination of the Italian Institute of Public Health, the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.\n\nPoor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy, mental health, drug abuse, obesity, educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations. Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.\nThe United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.\n\nRelative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The Whitehall I and II studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.\nThe negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels. This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.\n\n\n\n"}

Trotman was the first foreign-born chairman and CEO of a Big Three American automobile manufacturer.\n\nTrotman was born on 22 July 1933 in Middlesex, England. He was educated at Boroughmuir School in Edinburgh, Scotland, and after studying at the University of East London, received a Master's degree in business administration from Michigan State University in East Lansing, United States.\n\nTrotman was a member of the Royal Air Force before joining Ford in 1955 as a management trainee in the United Kingdom. He was involved in the development of the Ford Cortina compact car there and was noticed by Henry Ford II. He came to the United States and earned a reputation for cost cutting. He became CEO of the company in November 1993 and remained in the position until he retired in December 1998. He was the first foreign-born CEO of the company, but was succeeded by Jacques Nasser of Australia.\n\nOne of Trotman's main contributions at Ford was the Ford 2000 initiative, launched in 1995. This was an attempt to unify and consolidate Ford's manufacturing, marketing and product development forces around the world. The initiative produced $5 billion in cost savings, and produced $7 billion in profits for Ford in 1997. Some people considered it a failure, however, as many of the resulting products (like the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique designs based on the European Ford Mondeo platform), were not very competitive in the American market in the long term, and the major restructuring was disruptive to the company. The inability of senior management to successfully implement this program in the mid- to late-1990s turned out to be a huge opportunity lost, one that Ford is desperately trying to leverage under the leadership of Alan Mulally in 2007. Trotman retired in January 1999 after 43 years with Ford in a variety of positions throughout Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.\n\nTrotman was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996 and was created a Life peer as Baron Trotman of Osmotherley in the County of North Yorkshire, on 2 March 1999 in recognition of his contributions to industry.\n\nTrotman was a director of ICI from 1997 until 2003 and became Chairman in January 2002. He ranked number 865 on the Sunday Times Rich List 2004 with a net worth of £45m.\n\nHe died on 25 April 2005 in Yorkshire.\n\n"}

{"id": "1810648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810648", "title": "Happy slapping", "text": "Happy slapping\n\nHappy slapping was a fad originating in the United Kingdom around 2005, in which one or more people out of boredom attack a victim for the purpose of recording the assault (commonly with a camera phone or a smartphone). Though the term usually refers to relatively minor acts of violence such as hitting or slapping the victim, more serious crimes such as the manslaughter of a pensioner and sexual assault have been classified as \"happy slapping\" by the BBC.\n\nThe ease and general availability of video cameras in mobile phones means that such attacks need not be planned carefully beforehand and are more easily watched and circulated for entertainment. Some political and media commentators claim the craze was inspired by such television shows as \"Jackass\", \"Dirty Sanchez\" and \"Bumfights\".\n\n\"Happy slapping\" started in the South London Borough of Lewisham, in a format known as \"Slap Happy TV\", where a happy-slapping video would be recorded, and then watched by dozens of people like a TV show, but in the form of a montage. Videos of Happy Slapping were commonly circulated via Bluetooth on mobile phones. The first newspaper article to use the phrase \"happy slapping\" was \"Bullies film fights by phone\", published in The \"Times Educational Supplement\" on 21 January 2005, in which reporter Michael Shaw described teachers' accounts of the craze in London schools.\n\nGary Martin, writing on \"The Phrase Finder\" website described the phenomenon as: \"Unprovoked attacks on individuals made in order to record the event, and especially the victim's shock and surprise, on video phones.\"\n\nMartin wrote that happy slapping \"began as a youth craze in the UK in late 2004. Children or passers by are slapped or otherwise mugged by one or more of a gang while others record the event on video and then distribute it by phone or Internet. Initially the attacks were, as the phrase would have us believe, fairly minor pranks ... As the craze spread the attacks became more vicious—often serious assaults known in legal circles as grievous bodily harm.\"\n\nWhen the international media attention surrounding attacks abroad reached a high point, a girl was sentenced to eight months in prison. She was sentenced on a number of counts including previous crimes. \n\nA common punishment in 2007 was a fine or up to 40 days in prison, suspended if the attacker has no previous record. The attacker shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for any term which does not exceed 3 years. Happy slapping is judged as \"simple battery\" as defined by section 244 of the Danish Criminal Code.\n\nIn February 2007, an amendment aimed at criminalising \"happy slapping\" was added to a law \"on the prevention of delinquency\" by the Parliament of France based on a proposal from then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. The anti-happy-slapping clause appears as the last part of Article 44, which also deals with ambushing law enforcement personnel. The law equates filming or photographing certain classes of violent crimes, including severe beatings and rape, with being an accomplice of such crimes. The law makes it illegal to broadcast the images of such crimes, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and/or a €75,000 fine.\n\nThe law does not apply to those who took the above actions in order to obtain evidence in court, or as professional journalism. Professional journalism is delimited in France by the \"press card\", which is awarded by a commission representing journalist unions and press organisations. As defined by law, a professional journalist is one whose main activity is professional paid journalism.\n\nThe bill was signed into law on 5 March 2007, despite some organisations, including Reporters Without Borders, and the French chapter of Wikimedia, arguing that this clause created a legal discrimination in criminal law between professional journalists and ordinary citizens practicing journalism. Specifically, it was argued that citizens filming incidents of police brutality and publishing such information online could be intimidated by law enforcement into remaining silent, or prosecuted for their actions. This criticism was relayed by the international media.\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy declared to Reporters Without Borders that \"the spirit of the law is not to infringe of freedom of information. However, if the least doubt subsisted, then I'm in favour of a clarification of the law.\"\n\nIn March 2008, a teenage girl who filmed the fatal beating of a man on her mobile phone was sentenced to two years' detention in the first prosecution of its kind in the United Kingdom. The judge stated that the courts had to make an example of such youths. She had pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court in February 2008 to aiding and abetting the manslaughter of Gavin Waterhouse, 29, from Keighley, West Yorkshire. Mark Masters, 19, from Keighley, and Sean Thompson, 17, from Bradford, were sentenced to seven and six years, respectively, after admitting to manslaughter. Waterhouse died from a ruptured spleen after being beaten in September 2007.\n\nJust before the attack, the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to \"video this\", prosecutors said. She approached Waterhouse, asked for money, and recorded the subsequent attack. She was sentenced to serve a two-year detention training order. Police said they were satisfied with the court's decision. The Crown Prosecutor said \"this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called 'happy slapping' incident\".\n\n\nThe group of British teenagers in the 2008 movie \"Eden Lake\" filmed the torturing and burning of a little boy.\n\nIn the 2009 film \"Harry Brown\", a teenager films the murder of an elderly man, which Michael Caine's character uses as evidence to inflict pain on the teenager.\n\nIn episode 1 of series 2 of British political satire \"The Thick of It\", Hugh tells Glenn to happy slap Ollie while Hugh takes a picture of it on Ollie's phone.\n\nIn \"Coronation Street\" in November 2013, Simon Barlow was the victim of a happy-slapping incident caused by Faye Windass and Grace Piper. Simon was attacked, forced into one of his cousin Amy's dresses and had lipstick tried to be applied to him. Grace filmed while Faye attacked him.\n\nIn 2011, Canadian filmmaker Christos Sourligas directed a film, also called \"Happy Slapping\", about this phenomenon. The film was shot entirely on iPhone 4S by the cast. It was re-edited in 2014 with new material to accommodate the \"selfie\"-obsessed market.\n\n\n"}

The parish has a population of 1,603.\n\nThe Kennet and Avon Canal passes through the village and a toll bridge links Bathampton to Batheaston on the north bank of the canal.\n\nBathampton Camp is a univallate Iron Age hill fort situated approximately east from the village. The site was excavated in 1904–05 and in 1952–54. Results found human and animal remains, pottery and flint flakes.\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Hampton.\n\nThe village used to be served by Bathampton railway station, but it was closed following the destructive Beeching cuts.\n\nPlasticine was manufactured in the village between 1900 and 1983 by a company founded by William Harbutt, who also lived in Bathampton.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for some local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.\n\nThe parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.\n\nBath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996 it was the Wansdyke District and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District.\n\nThe parish is part of 'Bathavon North' electoral ward. As well as covering \"Bathampton\", Bathford and Batheaston this ward stretches east to Kelston. The total population of this ward as at the 2011 census was 7,147.\n\nThe parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nAbove Bathampton is a steep slope, heavily quarried for stone near the top in the area now called Bathampton Rocks, leading to Bathampton Down. Until the late 1950s the track used for bringing stone down into the valley could be seen; it crossed the main A36 road over a short rock bridge known as the Dry Arch. This was demolished in 1958 as it was too low for double-decker buses and other traffic.\nBathampton Rocks was the site of the Bathampton Patrol (Auxiliary Units) Operational Base during the Second World War. at OS Grid Ref ST778651 ()\n\nWhen the A46 Bathampton by-pass was built, an area of 9 hectares was created to provide additional flood relief. The wet meadows and the oxbow lake which were made have proved attractive to a number of migrant birds with waders such as dunlin, ringed and little ringed plover, and green and common sandpiper in spring and autumn. Sand martin and kingfisher have been seen regularly by the oxbow, and other migrants have included yellow wagtail, whinchat and hobby.\n\nIn 2009, the local Council identified the meadows as a possible new park and ride site to alleviate traffic congestion in the city. In January 2017 the council confirmed that the Bathampton Meadows site as it preferred option for a park and ride site to the east of the city, However the owner, Steve Horler, says that he is unwilling to sell the land. Immediate plans were abandoned in 2017, following public opposition.\n\nAbove the village is Sham Castle, a folly built in 1762 by Richard James, master mason for Ralph Allen, \"to improve the prospect\" from Allen's town house in Bath. It is a screen wall with a central pointed arch flanked by two 3-storey circular turrets, which extend sideways to a 2-storey square tower at each end of the wall. It is illuminated at night.\n\nIn the 13th century John Stafford, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, was the vicar of Bathampton.\nThe Parish Church of St Nicholas has 13th-century origins with 15th-century alterations and tower. In the mid-18th century Ralph Allen added Gothic components after he acquired Bathampton Manor by marriage in 1731. The building was further restored and the north aisle built in 1858 by Henry Goodridge and the chancel was restored in 1882 by Charles Edward Davis. The \"Australia Chapel\" in the south aisle contains memorials to the Allen family and to Admiral Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales. Phillip was buried in the church after his death in 1814 and although it was unnoticed for many years, the grave was discovered in 1897 and the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Henry Parkes, had it restored. The windows of the sanctuary carry the coat of arms of the Federal Government and the six Australian States.\n\nBuried in the church yard is the body of the French aristocrat, Adolphe, Vicomte du Barry, a nephew-by-marriage and close personal friend of Madame du Barry, Louis XV's legendarily beautiful mistress. The Vicomte had been living in nearby Bath when he was killed in a duel with an Irish adventurer, Captain Rice.\n\n"}

{"id": "1810673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810673", "title": "Rooster (song)", "text": "Rooster (song)\n\n\"Rooster\" is a song by the American rock band Alice in Chains, featured on their second studio album, \"Dirt\" (1992). The song was released as the fourth single from the album in 1993. It is the fifth song on the original pressing of the album and sixth on others. \"Rooster\" spent 20 weeks on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 7. The song was included on the live album \"Unplugged\" (1996) and the compilation albums \"Music Bank\" (1999), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), and \"The Essential Alice in Chains\" (2006). A demo version of the song was also included on \"Music Bank\". Cantrell would later name his music publishing company as \"Rooster's Son Publishing\".\n\n\"Rooster\" was recorded at Eldorado Studios on Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard, co-produced by Alice in Chains with Dave Jerden.\n\nIn the liner notes of 1999's \"Music Bank\" box set collection, songwriter Jerry Cantrell said of the song: \"I think there's some darts on the demo that maybe we didn't get here (on \"Dirt\"), but this has something all of its own... quality, for one thing.\"\n\nThis song was written by Alice in Chains guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell for his father, Jerry Cantrell Sr., who served with the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. \"Rooster\" was a childhood nickname given to Cantrell Sr. by his great-grandfather, because of his perceived \"cocky\" attitude and his hair, which used to stick up on top of his head like a rooster's comb. \n\nThe \"Rooster\" nickname is often mistakenly attributed to a reference to men carrying the M60 machine gun (\"Walking tall machine gun men\"), the muzzle flash from which makes an outline or pattern reminiscent of a rooster's tail. It is also often mistakenly attributed to the 101st Airborne Division - in which Cantrell's father served - who wore shoulder sleeve insignia on their arms featuring a bald eagle. As there are no bald eagles in Vietnam, the closest thing to which the Vietnamese could draw a comparison was the chicken, thus leading to the pejorative \"chicken men.\" \n\nCantrell wrote the song while living at Chris Cornell and Susan Silver's house in Seattle at the start of 1991. Silver is Alice in Chains' manager. Alone, late at night, Cantrell kept thinking about his father and the psychological scars from his time in the Vietnam War that contributed to the breakdown of his family. Cantrell wrote the lyrics from the standpoint of his father.\n\nIn the liner notes of 1999's \"Music Bank\" box set collection, Jerry Cantrell said of the song:\nIt was the start of the healing process between my Dad and I from all that damage that Vietnam caused. This was all my perception of his experiences out there. The first time I ever heard him talk about it was when we made the video and he did a 45-minute interview with Mark Pellington and I was amazed he did it. He was totally cool, totally calm, accepted it all and had a good time doing it. It even brought him to the point of tears. It was beautiful. He said it was a weird experience, a sad experience and he hoped that nobody else had to go through it.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with \"Guitar for the Practicing Musician\" magazine, in response to the question \"Do you feel you communicated with [your father] with this song?\", Cantrell responded:\nYeah. He's heard this song. He's only seen us play once, and I played this song for him when we were in this club opening for Iggy Pop. I'll never forget it. He was standing in the back and he heard all the words and stuff. Of course, I was never in Vietnam and he won't talk about it, but when I wrote this it felt right...like these were things he might have felt or thought. And I remember when we played it he was back by the soundboard and I could see him. He was back there with his big gray Stetson and his cowboy boots — he's a total Oklahoma man — and at the end, he took his hat off and just held it in the air. And he was crying the whole time. This song means a lot to me. A lot.\n\nCantrell said of the song in a 2006 interview with \"Team Rock\":\nThat experience in Vietnam changed him [his father] forever, and it certainly had an effect on our family, so I guess it was a defining moment in my life, too. He didn’t walk out on us. We left him. It was an environment that wasn’t good for anyone, so we took off to live with my grandmother in Washington, and that’s where I went to school. I didn’t have a lot of my father around, but I started thinking about him a lot during that period. I certainly had resentments, as any young person does in a situation where a parent isn’t around or a family is split. But on \"Rooster\", I was trying to think about his side of it – what he might have gone through. To be honest, I didn’t really sit down intending to do any of that; it just kinda came out. But that’s the great thing about music – sometimes it can reach deeper than you ever would in a conversation with anybody. It’s more of a forum to dig deeper. It felt like a major achievement for me as a young writer. When I first played it to my father, I asked him if I’d got close to where he might have been emotionally or mentally in that situation. And he told me: ‘You got too close – you hit it on the head'. It meant a lot to him that I wrote it. It brought us closer. It was good for me in the long-run and it was good for him, too.\n\n\"Rooster\" was released as a single in February 1993. It spent 20 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 7.\n\nNed Raggett of Allmusic said that the song \"[keeps] both the volume and the tenderness in play while tackling a slightly unexpected subject\" and that it \"alternates between almost dreamy verses, and surging, blasting choruses.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Rooster\" was released in February 1993, and was directed by Mark Pellington. The music video featured real Vietnam War documentary/news footage as well as some very realistic, graphically re-enacted combat scenes. Jerry Cantrell's father was a consultant on the video, as it explores Cantrell Jr.'s interpretation of his father's war experience.\n\nThe \"Rooster\" character (played by James Elliott), was based on Alice in Chains' guitarist/vocalist, Jerry Cantrell's father (Jerry Cantrell Sr.), whose lifelong nickname was \"Rooster.\" Cantrell Sr. served two combat tours in Vietnam, and also appears in the music video talking about his war experiences. Cantrell Sr.'s scenes were filmed on what was then Cantrell's great uncle's property and is now the site of Jerry Cantrell's family ranch in Atoka, Oklahoma. Cantrell Sr.'s scenes, filmed in stark black & white, show him hunting in the woods as an older man, while having \"flashback\" memories of his youthful Vietnam combat experiences (which are shot in full color). The uncut (more graphic) version of the video is available on the home video release \"\". \"Rooster\" was the last music video to feature original bass player Mike Starr, who is pictured on the cover of the single.\n\nThe intense combat scenes for the video were actually filmed on location in Angeles National Forest in January 1993 and have been favorably compared to Oliver Stone's classic Vietnam War film \"Platoon\". VN Veteran and Military Technical Advisor Dale Dye served as advisor on both the \"Rooster\" video and on \"Platoon,\" among many other projects in Hollywood. Actor James Elliott (\"Southland\", \"Entourage\", \"Mafia II\", etc.) portrayed the title role of \"Rooster\", the Team Leader of a Long Range Recon Patrol (LRRPs) in the combat scenes. Elliott, who is right-handed, had to learn how to handle multiple combat weapons left handed for the production in order to match the real Cantrell Sr.'s footage (Cantrell Sr. is left handed and holds his knife/rifle that way in the video). The military weapons and gear used and worn by the actors in the video are not all period-authentic. The M16A2 is used (which was not used until the 1980s), as well as the Nomex flight gloves which were not used until well into the Vietnam War. Dale Dye provided Elliott with some of his own personal combat gear which Dye had actually worn during multiple tours in Vietnam, including his military watch and map light, among other items.\n\nOther actors who appear in the video include Casey Pieretti (well known real-life amputee actor/stunt performer); and popular character actor Jon Gries (\"Napoleon Dynamite\", \"Lost\", etc.). Pieretti, who walks/runs extremely well with a prosthetic leg, performed a very graphic and difficult scene in which his leg was \"blown off\" by a land mine and Elliott's \"Rooster\" character offers life-saving medical aid on the battlefield. Jon Gries's character is shown being shot in the chest during intense combat with North Vietnamese infantry troops and dying in the arms of Elliott's \"Rooster\" character in the final emotionally charged combat scenes of the video. Also featured are scenes of a group of children playing with bubbles.\n\nReal life combat veterans have often commented about how moving and realistic these scenes were, yet MTV initially pulled the controversial video from rotation due to complaints about the graphic nature of the war scenes. This upset the band a great deal, especially Jerry Cantrell, who has stated how much of a foolish double standard existed at the time, as \"Rooster\" simply portrayed actual history with realism, yet MTV routinely showed gangsta rap and other violent videos in which gratuitous violence/death/killing was portrayed and clearly glorified. At the time the video was also the longest music video ever aired in full on MTV (running approximately 7 minutes long).\n\nCantrell's father joined Alice in Chains during \"Rooster\" on stage for the October 19, 2007, show in Tulsa, at Cain's Ballroom. Alice in Chains performed an acoustic version of \"Rooster\" for its appearance on \"MTV Unplugged\" in 1996 and the song was included on the \"Unplugged\" live album and home video release. Live performances of the song can also be found on the \"Heaven Beside You\" single, the compilation album \"\", and the live album \"Live\". \n\nIn the Primus DVD \"Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People\", Alice in Chains are seen playing the song live, with Les Claypool joining the band on stage dressed in a chicken suit. Jerry Cantrell reacts by throwing a bottle at Claypool and chasing him off the stage.\n\nJerry Cantrell often introduces his father on stage before playing the song at Alice in Chains' concerts.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest in the country and the fifth largest in the world for its collection of books (17.5 million). It was named the V. I. Lenin State Library of the USSR from 1925 until it was renamed in 1992 as the Russian State Library.\n\nThe library has over 275 km of shelves with more than 43 million items, including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350 thousand music scores and sound records, 150,000 maps and others. There are items in 247 languages of the world, the foreign part representing about 29 percent of the entire collection.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1991 at least one copy of every book published in the USSR was deposited with the library, a practice which continues in a similar method today, with the library designated by law as a legal deposit library.\n\nThe library was founded on July 1, 1862, as Moscow's first free public library named \"The Library of the Moscow Public Museum and Rumiantsev Museum\", or \"The Rumiantsev Library\". It is nicknamed the \"Leninka.\" Rumyantsev Museum part of the complex was Moscow's first public museum, and housed the Art collection of count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev, which had been given to the Russian people and transferred from St. Petersburg to Moscow. Its donation covered above all books and manuscripts as well as an extensive numismatic and an ethnographic collection. These, as well as approximately 200 paintings and more than 20,000 prints, which had been selected from the collection of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, could be seen in the so-called Pashkov House (a palace, established between 1784 and 1787, in the proximity of the Kremlin). Tsar Alexander II of Russia donated the painting \"The Appearance of Christ before the People\" by Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov for the opening of the museum.\nThe citizens of Moscow, deeply impressed by the count's altruistic donation, named the new museum after its founder and had the inscription \"from count Rumyantsev for the good Enlightenment\" carved above its entrance. In the subsequent years, the collection of the museum grew by numerous further donations of objects and money, so that the museum soon housed a yet more important collection of Western European paintings, an extensive antique collection and a large collection of icons. Indeed, the collection grew so much that soon the premises of the Pashkov House became insufficient, and a second building was built beside the museum shortly after the turn of the 20th century to house the paintings in particular. \nAfter the October Revolution the contents again grew enormously, and again lack of space became an urgent problem. Acute financial problems also arose, for most of the money to finance the Museum flowed into the Pushkin Museum, which had only been finished a few years before and was assuming the Rumyantsev Museum's role. Therefore, it was decided in 1925 to dissolve the Rumyantsev Museum and to spread its collections over other museums and institutions in the country. Part of the collections, in particular the Western European art and antiques, were thus transferred to the Pushkin Museum. Pashkov House (at 3 Mokhovaya Street) was renamed the Old Building of the Russian State Library. The old state archive building on the corner of Mokhovaya and Vozdvizhenka Streets was razed and replaced by the new buildings.\nConstruction of the first stage, designed by Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreikh in 1927–1929, was authorized in 1929 and commenced in 1930. The first stage was largely complete in 1941. In the process, the building acquired the \"modernized neoclassicism\" exterior features of the Palace of Soviets (co-designed by Shchuko and Gelfreikh), departing from the stern modernism of the 1927 drafts. The last component of Shchuko's plan, a 250-seat reading hall, was opened in 1945; further additions continued until 1960. In 1968 the building reached its capacity, and the library launched construction of a new depository in Khimki, earmarked for storing newspapers, scientific works and low-demand books from the main storage areas. The first stage of Khimki library was complete in 1975.\n\nIn 1925 the complex was renamed the V. I. Lenin State Library of the USSR. In 1992, it was renamed the Russian State Library by order of a decree from President Boris Yeltsin.\n\n\n"}

Today, Sears is primarily known as the man who penned the words to \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\" in 1849. It has been sung to two tunes, one by Richard Storrs Willis and another adapted by Arthur Sullivan from a traditional English air.\n\nSears originally wrote the song as a melancholy reflection on his times while a minister in Wayland, Massachusetts, US. However, \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\" has since become a popular Christmas carol.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1810, the youngest of three sons of Joseph and Lucy (Smith) Sears, Edmund grew up on a farm within sight of the Berkshire Hills, in Sandisfield, Massachusetts. Sears attended Union College, in Schenectady, New York, where he was a member of the Delta Phi fraternity. Following graduation from Union in 1834, Sears studied law for nine months under a lawyer in Sandisfield. He attended Harvard Divinity School, graduating in 1837 and began to preach as a missionary in Toledo, Ohio, remaining nearly a year. He served the Greater Boston Unitarian congregation in Wayland, and then a larger congregation in Lancaster. After seven years of hard work, he suffered a breakdown and returned to Wayland. He wrote \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\" while serving as a part-time preacher in Wayland.\n\nIn addition to the above noted hymn, Sears authored the following publications: \"Fire-side Colloquies\" (1847); \"Regeneration\" (1853); Calm on the Listening Ear of Night; Pictures of the Olden Time, 1857; \"Athanasia\" (1858); and Sermons and Songs of the Christian Life, 1875. With Rev R Ellis he edited \"The Monthly Religious Magazine\" for twelve years.\n\nSears found Christ best presented in the Gospel of John. \"The Fourth Gospel the Heart of Christ\" (1872) was his most widely read work.\n\nSears preached the equality of women and men. After the Fugitive Slave Law was passed, Sears declared from his pulpit that \"when the human and the Divine law were in conflict it was the duty of all to obey the latter.\" On Sunday, June 16, 1856, Rev. Sears delivered a sermon entitled \"Discourse\" which not only condemned chattel slavery as evil, but also the slaveholders whom he called the \"slave power.\" The sermon was deemed to be such a strong argument against slavery that it was published and circulated as a pamphlet by Massachusetts Abolitionists. \"When wrong has become so organized as to make the state its permanent body,\" said Rev. Sears, then the state's functions and the men holding offices do the bidding of wrong and of evil. Rev. Sears continued, \"... humanity dies out of it [the state], and demonism becomes its life and soul.\"\n\nHe died January 14, 1876, in Weston, Massachusetts.\n\nBasic biographical information on Sears may be found in:\nObituaries and tributes are in the Unitarian Review (Feb. 1876); the Christian Register, 22 and 29 Jan. 1872; and the Boston Daily Advertiser, 18 Jan. 1876.\n\n"}

The constituency also includes parts of Allerdale and Carlisle districts but has been losing parts of these areas to other seats at each boundary review.\n\nPenrith and The Border is the largest constituency by area in England. Despite the name it only includes part of the English border with Scotland. The neighbouring constituency of Hexham (together with Berwick-upon-Tweed) also takes in the border area. The name stems from the fact that when the constituency was first created it consisted of the Penrith Rural and Urban Districts, the Border Rural District and also the Alston with Garrigill Rural District.\n\nA heavily undulating, mostly farmed terrain dotted by market towns and historic villages, with wooded mountainsides and heath-covered tops, the constituency is focused on the Eden Valley between the Pennines and the Lake District, with the vale of the River Irthing above Carlisle. In the north towards Scotland are 8 of its 42 wards all beside or in the market town of Brampton which sits beside Hadrian's Wall.\n\nThe constituency tends to have modest incomes, low unemployment and a rate of dependency on social housing lower than urban centres.\n\nDespite its location, Penrith and the Border has been continuously represented by Scots MPs for the last sixty years. The seat was represented for nearly three decades by William Whitelaw, who served as a cabinet minister in various capacities during Conservative governments of the 1970s and 1980s and later joined the House of Lords. His successor the former Conservative Chief Whip and junior minister, David Maclean sat as MP from 1983 to 2010 when he stood down due to the state of his health; he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996. He was succeeded by Rory Stewart.\n\n\n"}

From 1529 extending unusually beyond the 19th century until the 1950 general election the seat had two-member representation. Party divisions tended to run stronger after 1931 before which two different parties' candidates frequently came first and second at elections under the bloc vote system.\n\nIn 1929, a recently elected Liberal, Sir William Jowitt decided to join the Labour Party and called for a by-election (which implies a single vacancy) to support this change of party, which he won, to take up for two years the position of Attorney General of England and Wales as part of the Government. He became the highest judge during the Attlee Ministry, the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Speaker of the House of Lords under a then hereditary-dominated House leading to a Conservative majority. Consequently, he was selected to be elevated to a peerage as 1st Earl Jowitt. With no sons, he was to be the last Earl and wrote the Dictionary of English Law.\n\nPreston was abolished as a constituency by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 being replaced by Preston North and Preston South constituencies.\n\nThe representatives since the seat's revival after 33 years of being split between (larger area) North and South seats have all been members of the Labour Party.\n\nThe member from 1987–2000 was Audrey Wise, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and reformer of maternity healthcare in opposition on the Select Committee.\n\n1983–1997: The Borough of Preston wards of Ashton, Avenham, Brookfield, Central, Deepdale, Fishwick, Ingol, Larches, Moorbrook, Park, Ribbleton, St John's, St Matthew's, and Tulketh.\n\n1997–2010: The Borough of Preston wards of Ashton, Avenham, Brookfield, Central, Deepdale, Fishwick, Larches, Moor Park, Ribbleton, Riversway, St Matthew's, and Tulketh, and the Borough of South Ribble wards of Bamber Bridge Central, Bamber Bridge South, and Walton-le-Dale.\n\n2010–present: The City of Preston wards of Ashton, Brookfield, Deepdale, Fishwick, Ingol, Larches, Moor Park, Ribbleton, Riversway, St George's, St Matthew's, Town Centre, Tulketh, and University.\n\nThe composition of the Preston constituency was confirmed in time for the 2010 United Kingdom general election as part of the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. While it previously crossed the River Ribble to include Bamber Bridge and Walton-le-Dale from South Ribble District, the seat now falls within the City boundaries.\n\nIn the late 19th Century the boundaries of the two-member Preston constituency were described as comprising:\n\n...[T]he old Borough of Preston, the township of Fishwick, so much of the Municipal Borough as is not included in the Parliamentary Borough, the Local Government District of Fulwood, and so much of the parishes of Lea, Ashton, Ingol, and Cotham \"{sic}\", and Penwortham, as will be added to the Municipal Borough of Preston on June 1st, 1889 \n\nIn the Representation of the People Act, 1918 the boundaries of the two-member constituency were described as the:\n\nThe single seat of Preston formed from 1918 until 1949 was created by the County Borough of Preston and Urban District of Fulwood. From the general election of 1950 to the 1983 Preston was divided into the constituencies of Preston North and Preston South. In time for the 1983 general election, the boundaries on which the current seat is drawn were confirmed. The northern, Fulwood area, was divided between Fylde and Ribble Valley.\n\nThe ward of Lea is within the constituency of Fylde.\n\nThe wards of Preston Rural North, Preston Rural East and the Fulwood wards (Cadley, College, Garrison, Greyfriars and Sharoe Green) are within the constituency of Wyre and Preston North. By the end of the review, the newly recommended Preston constituency had the smallest number of voters of an English constituency based on 2006 electorates.\n\nRepresentatives have sat in Parliament for Preston for nearly 800 years, the first recorded names being Willielmus fil' Pauli and Adam Russel. Prior to being reformed as \"Preston\" in 1983, the former Preston North and Preston South seats were amongst the most marginal in the country - in 1979, Conservative Robert Atkins won Preston North by 29 votes.\n\nWith the suburban, middle class former Fulwood Urban District area within Ribble Valley (and from 2010 Wyre and Preston North), the southern portion has awarded MPs with much healthier and secure majorities. Almost all of Preston's representatives from 1915 to 1950, and since its recreation as a single constituency in 1983, have been Labour candidates.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1949, the two-seat constituency of Preston was formed by the County Borough of Preston and the Urban District of Fulwood. In 1997, Audrey Wise secured a majority of over 18,000. The collapse of the Conservative vote - 10 percentage points down from 1992 - was firmly with the pattern of the Tory fortunes in that year.\n\nThe death of Audrey Wise in 2000 triggered a by-election. At that Preston by-election, Mark Hendrick, former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Lancashire Central constituency with Preston at its heart, secured a victory with a 4,400 majority. The surprise of the night was the result of the fledgling Socialist Alliance, for whom Terry Cartright saved his deposit.\n\nLess than a year later, the 2001 general election returned Mark Hendrick with a much healthier 12,200 majority, up against South Ribble councillor Graham O'Hare for the Conservatives and the then local Liberal Democrat leader Bill Chadwick. In real terms, all three main parties lost support from 1997 - Labour down by over 8,000 votes, Conservatives reduced by over 2,200 and Lib Dems 2,300 lower. One notable candidate in 2001 was David Braid, also a candidate in a number of other seats that year, who had been the \"Battle for Britain\" candidate in the previous year's by-election.\n\nThe 2005 general election was notable for the changes in share of the vote of the minor parties. The first ever Respect candidate, local councillor Michael Lavalette, firmly saved his deposit with nearly 7% of the vote. The Liberal Democrats had chosen former Conservative County Councillor William Parkinson, and had their best result since 1997. Fiona Bryce for the Conservatives, remained in second place seeing her share of the vote remain stable despite the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) polling over 1,000 votes. Mark Hendrick secured another term as MP, although his vote total was 3,000 less than 2001 and 12,000 less than Audrey Wise in 1997.\n\nLabour continued to represent Preston at the elections of 2010, 2015, and 2017. Whilst Mark Hendrick secured less than 50% of the votes cast in 2010, the first time this has occurred at a Preston election since 1983, subsequent results had much stronger Labour majorities. Second place went back to the Conservative Party, regaining from the Liberal Democrats who took second place for the first time in 2010.\n\nFor the general election expected to take place in 1939/1940, the following candidates had been selected;\n\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

Phones compliant with the GAIT standard can operate on either contemporary GSM networks, or the legacy IS-136 TDMA and AMPS networks found extensively throughout North America.\n\nSince GAIT phones are interoperable over several types of networks, users could operate their phones in a much larger area of North America compared to phones that used only the GSM standard. The modern equivalent of a GAIT phone would be a GSM phone that also supports the CDMA IS-95 modes used\nin North America. Such phones are sometimes called \"world phones,\" although this phrase is also used to describe a GSM phone that supports all four frequency bands used throughout the world.\n\nA GAIT-compliant mobile phone typically accepts a SIM card, similar to a standard GSM phone; however, depending on the wireless provider, the SIM card enables access not only to that wireless provider's GSM network, but also enables use of the telephone on any TDMA or AMPS networks run by the wireless provider. In addition to the usual IMEI found on standard GSM mobile phones, a GAIT-compliant mobile phone also includes an AMPS-style ESN unique to the mobile phone.\n\nIn the United States, Cingular Wireless (now AT&T Mobility) offered the Nokia 6340 and Sony Ericsson T62u to customers who wished to have a GAIT mobile phone (although these phones are no longer marketed through AT&T). An update to the Nokia 6340, the Nokia 6340i, added GSM 850 support and was also carried by Cingular. The Nokia 6340 was also offered by Canadian provider Fido Solutions. The version sold by Fido was unique in that it was used solely for analog roaming, with the IS-136 \"TDMA\" portion of the phone disabled. Fido discontinued the phone upon their acquisition by Rogers Wireless, which allowed access to Rogers' extensive GSM network that already overlaid the existing analog networks in Canada. Rogers Wireless, meanwhile, never offered a GAIT solution to customers, as their entire IS-136 TDMA and AMPS networks were overlaid with GSM by the time the service was launched.\n\n"}

As of December 2012, unemployment was significantly lower than the national average.\n\nWith the exception of one year when, following a by-election, it was represented by a Liberal Democrat, the MP has been a Conservative; the lowest majority was 11.6% in 1997.

At that time, in dramatic bellwether fashion, Labour's David Borrow gained the seat on a clear majority, with nearly 26,000 votes, 2,000 less than Robert Atkins' victory in 1983 which was the equally unusual landslide result. From the 1997 \"landslide year\" until 2010, David Borrow's vote total and majority consistently shrunk with a swing back to the Conservatives at every election. In terms of the other parties, Liberal Democrats have not thus far achieved better than third and 2005 saw UKIP nominating a candidate for the first time, and taking just over 1,200 votes.

The population in 2011 was 24,462, in an area of 158.17 km². The urbanized centre of Cartaxo had a population of 9,507 in 2001.\n\nIn written and oral history, the territory of Cartaxo was an important point in the interior of the country. A Roman road, crossing Alenquer (Lerabriga), connected ancient Olissipo (Lisbon) to Santarém (Scallabis) through the territory of Cartaxo. Yet, before the Romans, other civilizations settled in the region, establishing castros in Vila Nova de São Pedro, Vale do Tejo or in the areas of Muge.\nSituated in the plains of the Ribatejo, Cartaxo was a battleground between Muslim and the Christians. Due to its proximity to Santarém, it was one of the centres disputed between Muslim and Christian forces for years, resulting in the destruction of Cartaxo. King Sancho II of Portugal found it necessary to repopulate the area, since it was located in a privileged position with fertile lands. He, therefore, assigned the land of Cartaxinho (today Ribeira do Cartaxo) to Pedro Pacheco, who was responsible for constructing a shelter for the poor, a task that neither Pedro Pacheco nor his descendants would accomplish.\n\nOral tradition suggests that the name \"Cartaxo\" was given to the lands by Queen Elizabeth of Portugal who, on a journey to the Monastery of Almoster, stopped to rest and quench her thirst. Alongside a spring, she was surprised by the beautiful song of an unfamiliar bird. Asking one of the peasants about the songbird, the serf responded that the song came from a bird of the kind called \"cartaxos\" or \"cartaxinhos\". Enchanted by the place, the Queen ordered that the land, then called \"Lugar da Fonte\", receive the name \"Lugar do Cartaxo\". It is unclear whether there is any truth to this story.\n\nIn 1312, Cartaxo received its first foral (\"charter\"), signed in Leiria by King Denis of Portugal, confirmed in 1487 by King John II (in Santarém), and in 1496 by Manuel (also in Santarém). The first foral, issued by Denis on 21 March 1312, was sent to his vassal, Garcia Martins, originating the foundation of the locality of Cartaixo. In this act, Denis exempted the region from taxes for those who grew and cultivated grapes during the first five years of their tenure. Settlers who accepted these land rights were required in return to present each year an eighth of their produce in wine and linen.\nThe historical importance of the municipality is supported by events of the Battle of Ourique, which were probably linked to Vila Chã de Ourique (1139), a concession of foral to Pontével, by King Sancho (1194) and the existence of the Royal Palaces of Valada (1361-1365).\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Cartaxo was one of the more populated areas of Estremadura, in the Comarca of Santarém, with just over 200 inhabitants. On the death of King John IV of Portugal, his testament granted several \"honours\" to his daughter (in 1656). On 10 December 1815, by royal decree from Rio de Janeiro, King John VI granted it administrative independence, followed up on 21 June 1995 with its elevation to the status of city.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, owing to the growth of technological innovations, Cartaxo became the centre of production of the typical wine of the Valley of the Tejo, much of which was sent by ship to Lisbon.\n\nCartaxo is located from Lisbon (its airport is the primary international gateway), and from the district capital, Santarém, served by many roadways and rail-lines. Direct access by the A1 motorway, its variant the Estrada Nacional E.N. 365-2, to the intersection of the A1 at Aveiras de Cima, also the E.N.3, that crosses the municipality, connecting the area between Carregado and Santarém.\n\nThe fields, town and flat-lands, with the river at their feet, make Cartaxo a rich landscape. The municipality is marked by agricultural fields, primarily vineyards, that occupy a large portion of the land. Vine cultivation and wine production has always been linked to the municipality, earning it the title \"Wine Capital\" of the Ribatejo.\n\nSituated in the heart of the Ribatejo, the municipality of Cartaxo occupies an area of approximately , comprised from the civil parishes of Cartaxo, Ereira, Lapa, Pontével, Valada, Vale da Pedra, Vale da Pinta and Vila Chã de Ourique.\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nThe municipality is served by the \"Linha Ferroviária do Norte\", with the station at Setil, the most important: it is part of the national rail network connection between the north and south. The rail stations in Santana and Reguengo are also points of departure and ingress to Cartaxo, permitting a level of regional mobility.\n\nCartaxo is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to Rostand, panache was not necessarily a good thing and was seen by some as a suspect quality.\n\nPanache is referred to explicitly at two points in the play but is implicit throughout: Cyrano's challenges to Montfleury, Valvert, and, at one point, the whole audience at the theatre (Act I), and his nonchalant surrender of a month's salary to pay for the damages; his duel with a hundred footpads at the Porte de Nesle (Act II), as well as his dismissal of the exploit when talking to Roxane (\"I've been much braver since then\"); his crossing the Spanish lines daily to deliver Roxane's letters (Act IV); and his leaving his deathbed to keep his appointment with her in Act V.\n\nThe explicit references bring in the double entendre: first, in Act IV, when sparring with de Guiche over the loss of de Guiche's white sash, he says: \"I hardly think King Henry would have doffed his white panache in any danger.\" A second instance is in Cyrano's last words, which were: \"yet there is something still that will always be mine, and when I go to God's presence, there I will doff it and sweep the heavenly pavement with a gesture: something I'll take unstained out of this world... my panache.\"\n\nIn Quebec, the word panache may also refer to antlers, such as those of a moose or deer. The Panache River is a tributary of the east bank of the Wetetnagami River flowing into Senneterre in the La Vallée-de-l'Or Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, in Quebec, in Canada.\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", the main character's ubiquitous perfume is called 'L'air de Panache'.\n\nPanache is a loan word that remains in use across English dialects, denoting a style that is confident and flamboyant.\n\n"}

It served both passengers and freight in its heyday and operated profitably throughout much of its existence. The Raritan River was absorbed into Conrail in 1980, becoming a branch line of Conrail Shared Assets Operations. It terminates at U.S. Route 1 in North Brunswick.\n\nThe Raritan River Rail Road was built when the peak of the U.S. railroad building fever was subsiding in the late 1880s. It was intended to extend from South Amboy to Bound Brook and New Brunswick. On April 21, 1888, Articles of Incorporation were filed in New Brunswick for the Raritan River Rail Road, with $40,000 paid in capital, amounting to $2,000 per mile, and capital stock of $100,000. At the first meeting of the board of directors in April 1888, Edward H. Ripley was elected President, E. W. Harrison was appointed Chief Engineer, and a construction contract to build the railroad was awarded.\n\nConstruction started in Sayreville in May 1888 with 60 lb/yd (30 kg/m) rail, with a few trains running by the end of that same year. The line started in Sayreville, New Jersey, with a connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) over Suchs’ Pennsylvania Railroad siding. Suchs was a sand and clay industry that already had a very long siding from the Pennsylvania Railroad’s old C&A line in Sayreville (connected a few miles west of today's Browns Yard). When the line east from Sayreville to South Amboy was completed, a connection was made with the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) over the New York & Long Branch, providing the Raritan River Railroad with connections to the two larger railroads. The Raritan was extended westward from Milltown to New Brunswick in 1891 and a new PRR connection was constructed in South Amboy in 1901, permitting abandonment of the original PRR connection at Suchs' siding.\n\nIn 1888, the Raritan River Rail Road began operation with two 4-4-0 engines (No.1 and No.2) and twenty 20-ton gondola cars. These small cars were used by Suchs and Crossmans to move the sand and clay found in the area.\n\nDisputes with workers and clashes with local landowners during construction of the Raritan River Railroad sparked sometimes heated conflict. On August 16, 1888, just four months after construction had started, an incident required summoning the local sheriff. One contractor, Charles Van Houghton of Jersey City, was hired to grade the road and lay stone culverts at South Amboy. Although Van Houghton was paid $5000 for the work, he was reported to have absconded without paying his workers their wages. The unpaid workers went on strike as a result, and the sheriff confiscated Van Houghton’s equipment so that the payroll could be met.\n\nA Saturday night clash resulting in a death occurred in Sayreville, New Jersey, on May 5, 1889, which would become known thereafter as the \"Sayreville Riot\". A local brick manufacturer, Noah Furman, owned land needed by the railroad for extension of its line from Sayreville to South River. As reported by \"The New York Times\", a \"frightful riot\" ensued when gangs on both sides fought over the railroad's attempt to seize the land by force when negotiations had stalemated and Furman obtained a court injunction restraining the railroad from crossing his property and asserting eminent domain. One of the riot participants was killed in the melee. Afterwards, two Raritan Rail Road officials were charged with murder in connection with the riot.\n\nCoverage of the Sayreville Riot arrests was sensationalized by the press, with the \"New York Times\" falsely reporting on September 16, 1889, that indictments of all officers of the Raritan River Railroad were expected in the case. The following day, the court in New Brunswick announced it was conducting an investigation into who leaked the rumor to the \"Times\". Some reporters were summoned to appear before the court to reveal their sources and explain how they obtained their information. It appears that all charges were eventually dropped. Later that year, on October 30, 1889, another labor dispute again required intervention by the sheriff when a sub-contractor's laborers rioted in South River due to not being paid their wages.\n\nAs construction of the mainline was progressing west towards New Brunswick, the first two branch lines were built: in 1890, the Sayreville Branch to access the Sayre and Fisher Brick Yards near the mouth of the Raritan River; one mile (1.6 km) of the Serviss Branch in East Brunswick was started in 1891, in order to access the sand and clay needed by Sayre and Fisher. The third locomotive (No. 3) was purchased in 1890 and fourteen 30-ton freight cars were ordered.\n\nBy July 4, 1891, the RRRR's first train left Milltown, and shortly thereafter the line reached New Brunswick, having laid twelve miles (19 km) of mainline track. The railroad decided not to cross the Raritan River into New Brunswick to reach Bound Brook, due to the expense and lack of potential freight business at the time in the largely undeveloped area.\n\nBetween 1888-1898, the line had 3 engines, 34 freight cars, 6 passenger cars, of main line, and two branch lines.\n\nAfter the line was built, both the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey started to buy stock in the Raritan. The Central acquired a 60% ownership share and the PRR 40%. Although wholly owned by the two bigger lines, the RRRR was locally managed from its headquarters on John Street in South Amboy.\n\nIn the 1890s, the RRRR continued upgrading its track, building stations, and generally upgrading its infrastructure. It acquired a number of small locomotives, adding to the roster as traffic increased. The first customers on the line were the brick companies, the clay and sand pits of Crossman's and Such's. In fact, Crossman's in Sayreville grew so large that an industrial narrow gauge line running in the pits brought the sand and clay to the connection with the RRRR.\n\nSayreville Junction was created almost at the midpoint of the line for storage and classifications of cars. RRRR trains would run straight from either the NYLB or PRR connection, and drop off the cars at Sayreville Junction, where they would be sorted for the runs either east or west at that point.\n\nThe 1900s saw the second branch line extended, the Serviss Branch was increased from one to four miles (6 km). This line ran from the RRRR main in East Brunswick, headed north, and curved back south towards South River again. In fact, the terminus of the Serviss Branch was just one mile (1.6 km) from the RRRR’s South River Station. This branch was built to service the many sand and clay pits that were opening along the area. Even a small brick yard was located at the end of this branch at Reid Street. During this same period, the current Sanford Street terminus in New Brunswick was finished, with elaborate brick passenger and freight stations. Two more engines were purchased to help with the increase in freight. Engines No.4 and No.5 were added to the roster in 1899 and 1900. A small batch of larger cars were ordered, five 40 ton cars. In about 1901, the first number 3 engine was replaced with a second, more powerful number 3.\n\nIn 1905 the South River Branch was built, two miles (3 km) south from the South River station. Engine No. 6 was added to the roster in 1905. By 1905, the Raritan River with its six locomotives had doubled its engine roster compared to the three engines it had in 1898. In around 1907, both engines No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by more powerful engines, which were assigned the same numbers.\n\nFreight traffic continued to grow substantially, necessitating larger gondolas. The Raritan River ordered forty-four 50 ton cars in 1910, for a total of 83 cars on its roster. Passenger service was never an important revenue source for the RRRR, which owned only six passenger cars in 1910. In Milltown, the Michelin Tire Company constructed a massive tire manufacturing complex employing more than 2,000 employees. Tons of raw materials and finished products rolled in and out of Milltown on the Raritan River.\n\nThe Milltown Station was a very busy place at train time. It had a Railway Express agent and priority packages were shipped on special rail cars attached to RRRR passenger trains for connections to other railroads, providing express rail shipment capability nationwide. Passenger traffic was also growing rapidly, so the RRRR purchased 12 passenger cars and 2 combine cars from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1915. Engine number 7 was added to the roster in 1912, engine number 8 was added in 1914, and engines 9 and 10 were added in 1915, bringing the total number of locomotives on the Raritan River to ten. By 1917, this would further increase to a total of 15 engines on the RRRR.\n\nDuring 1917, the Gillespie Branch was built into an isolated wooded area, to access the T Gillespie Powder Works. With Gillespie, DuPont, and Hercules all making munitions for World War I, it was a very busy time on the RRRR. At its peak, DuPont was supplying four 50-ton cars per day of weapons and/or munitions. The Gillespie site was destroyed by explosions on October 4, 1918.\n\nIn addition to munition plant shipments along the line, World War I also resulted in a substantial increase in passenger traffic. In 1917, two more Lackawanna passenger cars were added. In 1918, passenger traffic reached an all-time high, with 22 daily passenger trains and 7 extra trains on Sundays. The Raritan River had 15 Engines and 16 passenger cars, as well as about 83 freight cars, moving 9,000 passengers per day and 1.5 million tons of freight and war materials in 1918.\n\nAfter the war ended, traffic subsided and engine number 8 was retired. In 1919, a new 12-stall roundhouse and shops were built near Stevens Avenue.\n\nThe 1920s saw a decline in freight and passengers, with increased competition from buses, cars, and trucks beginning to have an adverse effect upon the RRRR. In 1924, Moody's listed the Raritan as having only 50 freight cars, 44 50-ton and 6 40-ton. All 30-ton and 20-ton cars were scrapped. By 1925, only six of the 14 former Lackawanna passenger cars remained on the RRRR's roster. Locomotive #11 was wrecked and engines No. 3, No. 4, and No. 6 were scrapped. The Milltown spur, or Fresh Ponds Spur, was built in 1925 to access a sand and clay pit just south of Milltown. By the late 1920s, engines No. 1 and No. 2 were also scrapped. By the end of 1929, the Raritan River Railroad had just eight working engines.\n\nThe Great Depression accelerated the downturn in business on the Raritan. The Michelin Tire Company closed its Milltown plant in early 1930, devastating the small town. Most of the sand and clay pits also shut down during those times, and service on the Serviss Branch was almost non-existent. Revenue traffic fell by half and passenger service was reduced considerably, to just four daily trains by 1930, compared to 22 in 1917. By the mid-1930s, the RRRR had only two ex-Lackawanna Railroad passenger coaches remaining of the original fourteen. The last two original 4-wheeled cabooses were scrapped. Engine No. 7 was scrapped in 1933; engine No. 12 was scrapped in 1937.\n\nAs of April 27, 1936, the Raritan River had only one scheduled round-trip passenger train, operating daily except Sundays between Parlin and New Brunswick. It left New Brunswick as Train #2 at 6:35 am, making stops at Milltown and South River, and arrived at Parlin 6:55 am. Return train #7 departed Parlin at 3:50 pm, arriving at 4:44 pm. On weekdays, the Raritan River also operated a through single tripper from Stevens Avenue in South Amboy as #1, at 5:45 am, making stops at Bergen Hill, Parlin, South River, and Milltown, arriving at New Brunswick 6:24 am.\n\nBy 1937, the multitude of sand, clay, and brick industries that contributed greatly to the Raritan River's success in the early years were virtually all gone. But Crossman's and Whitheads' did survive, and were starting to grow again. About half of the 50-ton gondola freight cars purchased in 1910 and used to service these industries were scrapped by 1937. The last combination passenger car, No. 22, was also scrapped in 1937, ending baggage service on the Raritan River Railroad and leaving the line with just one passenger car, No. 27.\n\nThe first two Lackawanna cabooses appeared on the line in 1937, numbers 5 and 6.\n\nIn 1938, the end of an era was reached on the Raritan River Railroad as passenger service was discontinued altogether after a half century of service. The last passenger train pulled out from the New Brunswick station on April 17, 1938. This closure allowed the Raritan to eventually tear down the Bergen Hill station and consolidate all business to the Parlin Station. The former Milltown and New Brunswick passenger stations were converted to freight stations.\n\nThe North Jersey Chapter of the NRHS sponsored a special excursion train on May 28, 1938, over the Raritan to mark the passing of regular scheduled passenger service. The special train left New Brunswick at 2:40 pm, stopped at the Lawrence Brook Trestle for photos, then proceeded up the Serviss Branch where it parked at Hendersons Siding just away from the Route 18 crossing. Many motorists stopped and gazed at the strange passenger train, as the Serviss Branch never had regularly scheduled passenger service. The special then proceeded back down the main and headed to South River, where participants observed the only manually hand-cranked swing bridge in New Jersey. They then proceeded to Sayreville Junction, where they witnessed the passing of a freight train, and the switching of freight cars. Eventually the group made it to South Amboy where they were given a tour of the RRRR shops and roundhouse area. The special then \"high-balled\" back to New Brunswick, with special permission granted to reach .\n\nIn 1938, a new engine appeared on the line, the first time in almost 23 years since the prior engine purchases in 1916 during World War I. The economic recovery by the late 1930s resulted in an increase in freight, necessitating the purchase of another engine, numbered 8 after the one that had been scrapped in 1919.\n\nThe 1940s brought World War II, and its associated increase in freight traffic. Another engine was added to the line in 1941, numbered 7 after the one scrapped in 1937. After the war's end, the RRRR purchased six surplus USRA engines for only $100,000, allowing the retirement of the line's elderly locomotives. In 1947, locomotive No. 15 was involved in a wreck at the PRR connection, and scrapped on the spot.\n\nThe 1950s brought dieselization to the RRRR, as the remaining ex-USRA engines were replaced with six EMD SW900 engines. The retirement of steam also meant that the roundhouse could be closed, reducing expenses considerably for the shortline. The Serviss Branch was abandoned and scrapped in 1956, after being dormant for almost a decade. The Fresh Ponds spur in Milltown was also removed.\n\nA temporary boost in tonnage on the Raritan occurred because of construction of the New Jersey Turnpike, which generated fill material and sand movements. With Crossmanns' help, the RRRR built a small loop track in Crossmans pits and moved hundreds of cars of sand. Major online shippers included National Lead, DuPont, Hercules, and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe industrial base of the East Coast was moving away, and this affected the RRRR along with all other eastern railroads. By 1964, all Less-Car-Load (LCL) freight was eliminated, and agents in the freight stations were dropped. By now most coal traffic was gone. The Raritan River acquired a damaged N&W boxcar after an insurance company write-off, and rebuilt it as No. 100 for non-interchange usage, to move freight back and forth between on-line companies.\n\nAlthough both parents of the RRRR, the CNJ and the Penn Central were bankrupt, the Raritan River remained solvent and continued to benefit from a major new industrial complex named Highview, which was built in East Brunswick with many spurs and industries connected. The old Serviss Branch was re-laid for two miles (3 km) and renamed the East Brunswick branch to serve Continental Bakery, which received many shipments of flour by rail. Sunshine Biscuit opened a plant at the end of the Gillespie Branch, and they too received flour by the RRRR. The South River Branch was upgraded, as well as the trackage in New Brunswick, for a new customer starting a rail-to-truck transfer there. The old Michelin Tire complex was rented and some freight traffic was generated there. The Raritan River also derived revenue from high per diem rates, leasing 100 fifty-foot box cars in 1975.\n\nThe Raritan River had its best revenue year in 1979, with operating revenues amounting to $1,968,671. The Raritan put an emphasis on customer service and benefited from having longtime online customers such as Dupont and Hercules (Formally Smokeless Powder Company) going back to the 1910s. Sunshine Biscuit kept the Gillespie branch alive, just as Continental Baking kept the East Brunswick branch active. This allowed continued rail service to a number of small and infrequent shippers, which would otherwise have been ended.\n\nWith the creation of Conrail in April 1976 to take over the failing eastern railroads, the then-profitable Raritan River was supposed to be included along with their bankrupt parent railroads. The RRRR resisted inclusion in Conrail and took court action to forestall it. Four years later, on April 24, 1980, the Raritan River Railroad merged into the Conrail system.\n\nConrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) is jointly ownned CSX and Norfolk Southern. Once merged into the Conrail system, the Raritan River Railroad mainline was renamed Conrail's Sayreville Secondary, and would be switched out of Conrail's Browns Yard near Bordentown Avenue. This required major upgrades to Browns Yard, as all classifications and storage were performed there instead of Sayreville Junction.\n\nThe old wooden and outdated steel cabooses were sold, and replaced with steel Conrail cabooses. The remaining 97 leased fifty-foot box cars were re-numbered and absorbed into the Conrail system. The six EMD SW900s were re-numbered for Conrail and did switch the RRRR line for a few years, but were eventually scrapped in 1984. Most union employees were assimilated into the Conrail System. The clerical and managerial staff were all terminated. Of the 56 employees on the payroll in 1980, 30 would be offered jobs with Conrail, 26 would not.\n\nConrail closed the shops in South Amboy, with the engines now left idling in Parlin, to the discomfort of neighbors. The interchange in South Amboy for the PRR was closed in 1976. Later, Conrail extended the Gillespie Branch to cross Bordentown Avenue and connect directly with Browns Yard, enabling abandonment of the South Amboy connection with the ex-CNJ NY&LB. The line was then cut back to the Phoenix Spur, which still receives freight today in the form of scrap steel. The South River Branch was abandoned in the early 1980s. The abandoned engine shop eventually burned down in 1983.\n\nThe New Brunswick and Parlin stations were demolished by the early 1990s. The Milltown spur to the old Michelin Tire Complex has been severed from the Mainline, but still remains crossing Main Street (and has been re-laid after repaving) The Milltown spur as well as the Michelin Complex are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. The RRRR Mainline currently terminates at Silverline Windows in North Brunswick, just under the Route 1 Bridge.\n\nIn the 1980s and the 1990s, some of the largest customers finally stopped shipping by rail: Dupont no longer receives freight and their siding is now disconnected from the main; and National Lead, at one time the Raritan River's largest customer, is today closed and listed as a brownfield site. Hercules is still connected, but only receives an occasional box car, not the significant tonnage it once shipped. Both the Sunshine Biscuit and Continental Baking plants have shut down. The Gillespie Branch now only survives since it connects the main to Conrail’s Browns Yard. The East Brunswick branch is still connected, and a few customers are still connected, but none are receiving freight currently. In the Highview Industrial Complex in East Brunswick, only one customer still receives freight. The South River Branch was abandoned in the early 1980s.\n\nPlans to expand the Rail-to-Truck transfer facility in the Raritan River's New Brunswick facilities were dropped by Conrail, despite support for the project by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and New Brunswick. As a result, the entire complex was eventually demolished and the wye area in New Brunswick was sold and redeveloped with townhouses.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the last customer in New Brunswick, Squibb, stopped getting tank cars. The former Johnson and Johnson plant in Milltown is now used by Silverline Windows, which receives many covered hoppers of plastic pellets. In October 2014, siding at the former National Lead site was reactivated for the shipment of radiologically contaminated soils to out-of-state disposal facilities.\n\nThe only remaining station is in Milltown; still proudly displaying its original sign: \"Raritan River Railroad – Freight Station\". It is in a deteriorating condition and there are plans being made by the Raritan River Chapter of the NRHS and the Borough of Milltown to move it to another location and restore it. The current owner, attorney James Curran, has indicated he would \"consider donating it.\" The RRRR logo can still be seen through the rust on the Manual Swing Bridge in South River.\nUnder Conrail the old RRRR lines remaining 5 customer, keep the line active. Steel, bricks, and plastic, and the occasional box car, can be spotted. Trains still run almost daily from Browns Yard.\n\nGerdau Steel in Sayreville is on the eastern end of the old Phoenix Spur and still receiving steel. Bricks, one of the commodities moved in significant quantities in the Raritan's beginning, are still shipped on the line to Riverside Supply. Mauser is the only company left in the East Brunswick Highview complex still receiving freight. The East Brunswick spur is no longer connected to the main line. Of almost a dozen spurs once in East Brunswick, only one still receives freight. On the western end, Silverline Windows still receives 1-2 cars of plastic pellets per week. Trains run very seldom to Silverline.\n\nNew Jersey Transit and Middlesex County, New Jersey, are studying potential future light rail options in the New Brunswick, New Jersey, area to alleviate traffic congestion, including the former Raritan River Railroad right-of-way which parallels the busy Route 18 highway corridor into New Brunswick. The future of the Milltown station and what's left of the Raritan River looks bright as the Raritan River Chapter of the NRHS tries to preserve the last remaining station and eventually gather the remaining cars and one engine along with other artifacts. Other historical societies in the area such as Tri State Railway Historical Society, Pine Creek Railroad, and the Quakertown Station Historical Society are also doing their part in preserving the surviving rolling stock for years to come.\n\n"}

A more formal term is \"Ḥamishah Ḥumshei Torah\", \"five fifths of Torah\". It is also known by the Latinised Greek term Pentateuch in common printed editions.\n\nThe word \"ḥumash\" may be a vowel alteration of \"ḥomesh\", meaning \"one-fifth\", alluding to any one of the five books: as the Hebrew has no vowel signs, it could be read either way. It could also be regarded as a back-formed singular of \"ḥumashim\"/\"ḥumshei\" (which is, in fact, the plural of \"ḥomesh\").\n\nIn early scribal practice, there was a distinction between a Sefer Torah, containing the entire Pentateuch on a parchment scroll, and a copy of one of the five books on its own, which was generally bound in codex form, like a modern book, and had a lesser degree of sanctity. The term \"ḥomesh\" strictly applies to one of these. Thus, \"ḥomesh B'reshit\" strictly means \"the Genesis fifth\", but was misread as \"ḥumash, B'reshit\" and interpreted as meaning \"The Pentateuch: Genesis\", as if \"ḥumash\" was the name of the book and \"Bereshit\" the name of one of its parts. Compare the misunderstanding of \"Tur\" to mean the entirety of the Arba'ah Turim.\n\nIn the legal codes, such as Maimonides' \"Mishneh Torah,\" it is laid down that any copy of the Pentateuch which does not comply with the strict rules for a Sefer Torah, for example, because it is not a parchment scroll or contains vowel signs, has only the same sanctity as a copy of an individual book (\"ḥomesh\"). In this way, the word \"ḥomesh\" (or \"ḥumash\") came to have the extended sense of any copy of the Pentateuch other than a Sefer Torah.\n\nThe word \"ḥumash\" generally only refers to \"book\" bound editions of the Pentateuch, whereas the \"scroll\" form is called a \"sefer Torah\" (\"book [of the] Torah\").\n\nIn modern Jewish practice: \n\n\n"}

He entered the Royal Navy, but at the end of two years quit it for the British East India Company's military service, and in 1842 obtained a commission in the Bengal Light Cavalry. In the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845–1846 he was given an appointment on the staff of Sir Hugh Gough, and served throughout the Sutlej campaign. In 1852 he became adjutant of Skinner's Horse.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, Loch severed his connection with India, and obtained leave to raise a body of irregular Bulgarian cavalry, which he commanded throughout the war. In 1857 he was appointed attaché to Lord Elgin's mission to East Asia, was present at the taking of Canton (Guangzhou) during the Second Opium War, and in 1858 brought home the Treaty of Yedo.\n\nIn April 1860, Loch accompanied Lord Elgin to China again, as secretary of the new embassy sent to secure the execution by the Chinese Qing Empire of its treaty engagements. The embassy was backed up by an allied Anglo-French force. With Harry Smith Parkes he negotiated the surrender of the Taku Forts (Dagu Forts). During the advance on the Qing capital, Peking (Beijing), Loch was chosen with Parkes to complete the preliminary negotiations for peace at Tungchow (present-day Tongzhou District, Beijing). They were accompanied by a small party of officers and Sikhs. It having been discovered that the Chinese were planning an attack on the British force, Loch rode back and warned the outposts. He then returned to Parkes and his party under a flag of truce in the hope of securing their safety. However, they were all taken prisoner by the Qing general Sengge Rinchen and incarcerated in the Ministry of Justice (or Board of Punishments) in Beijing, where the majority of the group died from torture or disease. Parkes and Loch were treated less barbarically after Prince Gong intervened. After three weeks, the negotiations for their release were successful, but they had only been liberated ten minutes when orders were received from the Xianfeng Emperor, who was then taking shelter in the Chengde Summer Palace, for their immediate execution.\n\nIn 1862, Loch married Elizabeth Villiers, whose twin sister was Edith Villiers. There is a tale that Henry proposed to the wrong girl by mistake and then refused to admit it. He and Elizabeth had two daughters and a son.\n\nLoch never entirely recovered his health after this experience in a Chinese dungeon. Returning home he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and for a while was private secretary to Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet, then at the Home Office. In 1863 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. During his governorship the House of Keys was transformed into an elective assembly, the first line of railway was opened, and the influx of tourists began to bring fresh prosperity to the island. In 1882 Loch, who had become Knight Commander of the Bath in 1880, accepted a commissionership of woods and forests, and two years later was made governor of the colony of Victoria in Australia. In June 1889 he succeeded Sir Hercules Robinson as Governor of Cape Colony and High Commissioner for Southern Africa.\n\nAs High Commissioner his duties called for the exercise of great judgment and firmness. The Boers were at the same time striving to frustrate Cecil Rhodes's schemes of northern expansion and planning to occupy Mashonaland, to secure control of Swaziland and Zululand and to acquire the adjacent lands up to the ocean. Loch firmly supported Rhodes, and, by informing President Paul Kruger that troops would be sent to prevent any invasion of territory under British protection, he effectually crushed the Banyailand trek across the Limpopo River (1890–1891). Loch, however, with the approval of the imperial government, concluded in July–August 1890 a convention with President Kruger respecting Swaziland, by which, while the Boers withdrew all claims to territory north of the Transvaal, they were granted an outlet to the sea at Kosi Bay on condition that the republic entered the South African Customs Union. This convention was concluded after negotiations conducted with President Kruger by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr on behalf of the high commissioner, and was made at a time when the British and Bond parties in Cape Colony were working in harmony.\n\nThe Transvaal did not fulfil the necessary conditions, and in view of an increasingly hostile attitude from Pretoria administration Loch became a strong advocate of annexation of the territory east of Swaziland, through which the Boer railway would have to pass to the sea. At length he induced the British government to adopt his view; and on 15 March 1895 it was announced that these territories (Amatongaland, etc.), would be annexed by Britain, an announcement received by Kruger with the greatest astonishment and regret.\n\nMeanwhile, Loch had been forced to intervene in another matter. When the commandeering difficulty of 1894 had roused the Uitlanders in the Transvaal to a dangerous pitch of excitement, he travelled to Pretoria to use his personal influence with President Kruger, and obtained the withdrawal of the obnoxious commandeering regulations. In the following year he entered a strong protest against the new Transvaal franchise law. Nonetheless the general situation in South Africa was assuming year by year a more threatening aspect. Cecil Rhodes, then prime minister of Cape Colony, was strongly in favor of a more energetic policy than was supported by the Imperial government. At the end of March 1895 the high commissioner, finding himself, it is believed, out of touch with his ministers, returned home embarrassed, a few months before the expiry of his term of office. In the same year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Loch, of Drylaw in the County of Midlothian.\n\nWhen the Second Boer War broke out in 1899 Loch took a leading part in raising and equipping a body of mounted men, named after him Loch's Horse. He died in London on 20 June 1900, and was succeeded as Baron Loch by his son Edward Douglas Loch (1873–1942).\n\nLoch, Victoria, Australia is named after the 1st Baron Loch.\n\nA portion of Douglas Promenade is named Loch Promenade in memory of Governor Loch. In addition the Isle of Man Railway locomotive No.4 \"Loch\" is named in his honour.\n\n"}

It was formed in 2002 following the merger of Technikon Natal and ML Sultan Technikon and it was initially known as the Durban Institute of Technology. It has five campuses in Durban, and two in Pietermaritzburg. In July 2019, approximately 33932 students were enrolled to study at DUT. The University is one of 5 technical institutions on the African continent to offer Doctoral Degrees. The current Chancellor is Ms Nonkululeko Nyembezi.\n\nThe Durban University of Technology is a result of the merger, in April 2002, of two technikons, ML Sultan and Technikon Natal. It was named the Durban Institute of Technology and later became the Durban University of Technology in 2007.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal's Indian population began arriving in the 1860s to primarily work as indentured labourers on the sugar plantations. In 1927, those with no formal educational qualifications were threatened with repatriation. This threat stimulated adult classes in literacy, as well as a range of commercial subjects, held in a mission school and a Hindu Institute, but it was not until after the Second World War, and thanks to substantial financial support from the public, that ML Sultan College came into being. It would be another decade, however, before the City Council, now preoccupied with the structures of the first Group Areas Act of 1950, allocated suitable land for a permanent campus.\nThe Natal Technical College was founded in 1907 and immediately began providing tuition to more than 350 part-time students. The structures of apartheid as it was codified through legislation weighed heavily on this institution as well. In 1955 the college was taken over by national education authorities; and in 1967 it became an exclusively white institution.\n\nIn 2019, Mlungisi Madonsela, a business administration student, was shot and killed during a protest, allegedly by private security guards.\n\n\nThe DUT student body elects a Student Representative Council annually.\n\n\nIn 2019, the university employed 841 academic staff, 51 percent of them female and 48 percent holding masters and 43 percent doctoral degrees.\n\nProfessor Thandwa Mthembu is the Vice-Chancellor and Principal of DUT.

Bending expected gender roles may also be called a genderfuck. Gender bending is sometimes a form of social activism undertaken to destroy rigid gender roles and defy sex-role stereotypes, notably in cases where the gender-nonconforming person finds these roles oppressive. It can be a reaction to, and protest of, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, or misandry. Some gender benders identify with the sex assigned them at birth, but challenge the societal norms that assign expectations of particular, gendered behavior to that sex. This rebellion can involve androgynous dress, adornment, behavior, and atypical gender roles. Gender benders may self-identify as trans or genderqueer.\n\nGender bending may be political, stemming from the early identity politics movements of the 1960s and 1970s, a guiding principle of which is the idea that the personal is political. In his 1974 article, \"Genderfuck and Its Delights\", Christopher Lonc explained his motivation for performing genderfuck: \"I want to criticize and poke fun at the roles of women and of men too. I want to try [to] show how not-normal I can be. I want to ridicule and destroy the whole cosmology of restrictive sex roles and sexual identification.\"\n\nThe term \"genderfuck\" has long been part of the gay vernacular, and started to appear in written documents in the 1970s. Sheidlower cites the definition of the term \"gender fuck\" in L Humphreys' 1972 work \"Out of the Closets: Sociology of Homosexual Liberation\" as \"a form of extended guerilla theatre\". Also quoted is the August 1972 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, in reference to the glam rock style: \"The new 'macho' transvestism, called vulgarly 'gender-fuck', a curious satire of female impersonation – dresses, pumps, full make-up and beards – is represented by, among others, three men in WAC uniforms and big moustaches\".\n\nTo \"fuck with\" gender, one must have an expectation to be able to rebel against. These expectations are socially constructed and can vary widely between cultures. The gender binary is the idea that only two genders exist: men and women. In many cultures it is only acceptable for an individual to embody one of two polar gender roles. Gender roles often mimic the social expectations of the sexual categories of \"male\" and \"female\". Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine. The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.\n\nIn many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes. These roles are highly influenced by culture and peers. This sex-role stereotype includes sexual orientation. To this end, those who go against expected conduct, for example gays and lesbians, may be seen as \"less than\" or \"other\".\n\nIn Western cultures, gender roles have changed somewhat over the years. However, mainstream western culture still tends to expect stereotypical \"feminine\" behaviors from females, and \"masculine\" sex-role stereotypes from males. A study by Princeton University outlined these common, prescriptive gender stereotypes: \"masculine\" - acts as a leader, aggressive, ambitious, analytical, assertive, athletic, competitive, defends own beliefs, dominant, forceful, has leadership abilities, independent, individualistic, makes decisions easily, self-reliant, self-sufficient, strong-personality, willing to take a stand, and willing to take risks. \"Feminine\" sex-role stereotypes, as defined by this same study included: affectionate, cheerful, childlike, compassionate, does not use harsh language, eager to soothe hurt feelings, flatterable, gentle, gullible, loves children, loyal, sensitive to the needs of others, shy, soft-spoken, sympathetic, tender, understanding, warm, and yielding.\n\nIn Christian and Jewish cultures, gender roles and gender presentation have been policed since Biblical times: \"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God\" (Deut. 22:5). Crossing these lines has been interpreted by some Christians as a moral transgression.\n\nHowever, other cultures - often indigenous peoples, or subcultures that exist within Western cultures - may conceptualize gender as having more than two options, and even see their people as potentially fulfilling more than one gender role. Some indigenous peoples of North America have historically had more than two gender roles as part of their social structure, while others, who may or may not have embraced this diversity historically, may accept modern two spirit people as part of their communities now. Other cultures may see people as being capable of embodying more than one gender role at different times, or of being \"in the middle\", \"embracing both male and female spirit\". One such example is the Bugis people of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. People of the Bugis society have a total of five genders. These genders include what would traditionally be seen as cisgender man and woman, as well as transgender men and women, and the androgynous \"Bissu\" shamans.\n\nOften, parody and exaggeration are used to transgress gender roles, usually to expose them as artificial. For example, a person who engages in gender bending may purposefully exaggerate conventional notions of femininity, or masculinity. Gender bending can also be achieved through cross-dressing and androgyny, both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of biological or physiological sex. Thus, gender bending protests gender essentialism. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well – for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Gender bending is based in gender performativity: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"\n\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. Androgyny is not specifically gender bending, but it can be considered as such if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so. The origin of the word \"androgynous\" is from the Greek \"androgynos\": \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\". Androgyny, as a form of gender expression. may present as a blended unification of masculine and feminine traits, with the goal of making one's sex indiscernible, or as a dichotomous mix juxtaposing male and female phenotypes, with the goal of transgressing gender norms. \n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star Prince was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. Eddie Izzard started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\nShakespeare used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra, Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Rosalind in As You Like It, Viola in Twelfth Night.\n\nGender bending is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is drag.\n\nDrag shows are stage performances where people perform in drag. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the person's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves drag kings or drag queens. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or lip sync.\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a faux queen or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.\n\nLiterature, in particular erotica, is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to Carol Queen's short story \"The Leather Daddy and the Femme\", where a lesbian femme uses a strap-on dildo to have sex with a gay leather daddy as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.\n\nGender bending is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is performed; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the gender binary roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally political radicalism. Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: \nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical – otherwise gender-benders such as Boy George, Prince, Annie Lennox, David Bowie etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck – such as that of RuPaul or (to a limited extent) Madonna – gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender \"as an axis of power\" that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining\n\nJudith Butler is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"gender performativity\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article \"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory\", Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, there is a gender binary along with strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script. This script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of these are ways to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, \"Gender Trouble\" (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.\n\nAccording to Susan Witt's 1997 study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more androgynous gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self. Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits gender performances that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson and Cristyn Davies report that a parental figure may respond with hostility. According to Roberts et al. in \"Pediatrics\", people who do not conform to the gender binary are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community. Types of abuse range from physical and sexual to psychological abuse and are not associated with homosexuality alone.\n\nThe Cockettes were a psychedelic drag queen troupe, founded in San Francisco In the late 1960s. According to the journal \"Maledicta\" in 1987: \"Real transvestites and transsexuals are... embarrassed... [by]... The gender-fuck Cockettes and such (in dresses and beards).\"\n\nCredited as one of the innovators of the early 70's glam rock era, lead singer and guitarist Marc Bolan of rock band T. Rex was dubbed 'feminine looking'. He was known for his volumised curly hair, vibrant wardrobe and experimentation with glittery make-up and eyeliner. As well as this, he wore platform boots and feather boas during his performances.\n\nExploiting his androgynous appearance, rock star David Bowie wore a dress on the UK cover of his 1970 album, \"The Man Who Sold the World\", and often wore dresses, makeup and leotards both onstage and while doing interviews. In a time when very few people were out, he announced he and his wife were both bisexual. In 1972 Bowie co-produced Lou Reed's album \"Transformer\", which includes several gender bending songs, notably the classic, \"Walk on the Wild Side\".\n\nThe New York Dolls are a protopunk band, formed in 1971 and who were very influential in the early New York City punk rock scene. They broke up in 1977 but reformed in 2004. While they often performed in dresses, long hair and glitter/glam makeup, at least one reviewers called their genderfuck \"quite subtle\".\n\nDr. Frank-N-Furter from the 1973 musical, The Rocky Horror Show, and later the cult film / midnight movie, \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", is a male bodied person but wears lingerie, clothing, and accessories considered feminine in the English and American culture of the era. The character also wears heavy make-up influenced by 1940s female film stars like Joan Crawford. In one of the songs featured in the musical Dr. Frank-N-Furter sings, \"I'm just a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania.\"\n\nPrince wrote many songs that dealt with ambiguity - of gender, of sexuality, and of race. A charismatic entertainer and prolific songwriter, his songs with bisexual content have also been recorded by artists such as Cyndi Lauper, who in \"When You Were Mine\", sang about sharing a lover with another man, who was in bed with them, \"sleeping in between the two of us\".\n\nAccording to SheWired, Grace Jones laughs at outside attempts to define her gender identity. Jones herself has said of her gender ambiguity that she feels her masculine side is \"a bit stronger\". NPR cites her as an influence on Madonna and Lady Gaga.\n\nSinger-songwriter and political activist Annie Lennox began her career as lead singer with The Tourists in the late 1970s. In The 1980s she fronted synthpop band the Eurythmics but has focused on solo work since the 1990s with the exception of an album and tour with Eurythmics In 1999. The \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" described her in 1995 as \"Gender-fuck goddess Annie Lennox\".\n\nThe American singer-songwriter and artist Phranc began her career in 1978 with punk band Nervous Gender. In 1985 \"Village Voice\" wrote: \"Part of Phranc's appeal is the genderfuck of her sweet feminine voice coming from such a masculine frame.\" She later worked with queercore band Team Dresch.\n\nThe charity, protest and street performance organization Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was formed by gay men in 1979, originally using nuns' attire and high camp to draw attention to social conflicts in the Castro, San Francisco. Currently they fundraise for AIDS and other LGBT causes and promote and educate on safer sex issues. The \"Cambridge Guide to American Theater\" identified them as one of the \"more anarchic uses of \"gender-fuck\"... [which]... \"parodied traditional drag\".\n\nBoy George of the 1980s band Culture Club, has cultivated an androgynous style, and was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the early 1980s. He famously stated, \"I can do anything. In \"GQ\", I appeared as a man.\"\n\nAmerican drag queen, singer, actor, and host/star of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul got his start by performing in genderfuck, performance art, music videos and punk bands in Atlanta in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nPat, a character from the television show \"Saturday Night Live\", served as the basis for the movie \"It's Pat\". The sketches and film feature an androgynous main character, Pat. People are unable to determine Pat's sex, including one male who cannot determine it after having sex with Pat while stranded on a deserted island.\n\nCharlotte Richardson Andrews of \"The Guardian\" says Marilyn Manson's gender-bending rock act \"shows trans identities can resonate with the public in a way that cannot be ghettoised\". Manson's gender-bending has been compared to that of Alice Cooper and Bowie.\n\nEddie Izzard started to freely talk about his transvestism in venues like Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992. His stance is that cross-dressing is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He remarks in his show \"Unrepeatable\", \"Women wear what they want and so do I.\" According to Izzard, \"Most transvestites fancy women.\" He identifies as \"a straight transvestite or a male lesbian\". He has also described himself as \"a lesbian trapped in a man's body\", transgender, and \"a complete boy plus half girl\".\n\nLady Gaga is very specific in what she wears and even states that, \"But in a sense, I portray myself in a very androgynous way, and I love androgyny.\"\n\nSome films including gender-fuck characters or drag characters are:\n\n"}

The seat largely comprises prosperous villages and small towns set amidst Cheshire countryside, featuring country parks, hills, recreation grounds and golf courses. The area was previously dominated by countryside; however, since the 1950s, it has developed a largely built-up, suburban character, it being located on the fringes of Greater Manchester. The largest centres of population are Alderley Edge, Wilmslow and Knutsford. Its proximity to Manchester means Tatton forms part of the commuter belt to the city.\n\nWorkless claimants, registered jobseekers, were in November 2012 lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.1% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\".\n\nDuring the 2016 EU membership referendum, the constituency voted to remain in the EU, despite both Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester voting to leave overall.

It was initially held by the Conservative Neil Hamilton.\n\nDuring the 1997 general election campaign, Tatton was one of the UK's highest-profile constituencies. Following Hamilton's implication in the Cash for Questions scandal of the 1990s, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats withdrew their candidates in favour of the former BBC journalist Martin Bell, who stood as an Independent, while those two parties supported his \"anti-corruption\" campaign. Bell was ultimately successful, with a majority of 11,077. Hamilton came second.\n\nHaving promised to serve only one term, Bell did not contest the seat at the 2001 election, and the seat was won by Conservative George Osborne with a majority of 8,611 (20.8%). Osborne held the seat at the 2005 election with an increased majority, and became the Shadow Chancellor that year. He held the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016, one of the highest frontbench government positions. Osborne served the seat until standing down at the 2017 election, having been announced as the new editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper in March of that year.\n\nEsther McVey, who had been MP for nearby Wirral West from 2010 to 2015, was elected in 2017. McVey was the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions after Theresa May's Cabinet reshuffle in January 2018, but resigned after concerns over May's plan of leaving the European Union in November 2018. McVey subsequently announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership in 2019, but was knocked out in the first round, receiving the lowest number of votes of all ten candidates.\n\n \n\n\n\n"}

This event series also included various stage races including the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a España, Paris–Nice and the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. The UCI ProTour replaced the UCI Road World Cup series (1989–2004) which contained only one-day races. Many of the classics, and all the Grand Tours, were not part of the UCI ProTour for the 2008 season because of disputes between the UCI and the ASO, which organizes the Tour de France and several other major races. Since 2009, many classic cycle races are part of the UCI World Tour.\n\nAlthough cycling fans and sports media eagerly use the term \"classic\", there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a classic cycling race. UCI, the international governing body of cycling, has no mention at all of the term in its rulings. This poses problems to define the characteristics of these races and makes it impossible to make precise lists. Several criteria are used to denote the importance of a cycling race: date of creation, historical importance and tradition, commercial importance, location, level of difficulty, level of competition field, etc. However, many of these paradigms tend to shift over time and are often opinions of a personal nature. One of the few objective criteria is the official categorization of races as classified by the UCI, although this is not a defining feature either, as many fans dispute the presence of some of the highest-categorized races and some older races are not included in the UCI World Tour.\n\nBecause of the growing ambiguity and inflation of the term \"classic\", the much younger term \"monument\" was introduced in the 21st century to denote the five most revered of the classic cycling races.\n\nUntil the 1980s there were originally eight recognised classics, the five Monuments (see Cycling Monuments below) plus Fleche-Wallone, Paris-Brussels and Paris-Tours. Due to various traffic and organizational problems these events came and went in various guises (for example, Paris-Tours became Blois-Chaville, before returning in its current form). Paris-Brussels disappeared altogether between 1967 and 1976. Fleche-Wallone was always on the Saturday before Liege-Bastogne-Liege (it was known as The Ardennes Weekend), before being shortened and moved to the preceding Wednesday. The remaining five then became known as the 'Monuments'.\n\nRik van Looy is the only rider to win all eight. Eddy Merckx and Roger de Vlaeminck both won seven, both missing out at Paris-Tours.\n\nTogether, Milan–San Remo, the Cobbled classics and the Ardennes classics make up the \"Spring Classics\", all held in March and April.\n\n\n\nThe summer classics are held from July to September.\n\n\nThe autumn classics are held from September to November.\n\n\nSeason openers are usually not regarded as highly as other classics, but receive a lot of attention because of their position early in the season, typically in February.\n\nSome Classics have disappeared, often because of financial problems. These include:\n\nThe Monuments are generally considered to be the oldest, hardest and most prestigious one-day events in cycling. They each have a long history and specific individual characteristics. They are currently the one-day races in which most points can be earned in the UCI World Tour.\n\n\nBoth Belgian 'monuments' – The Tour of Flanders and Liège–Bastogne–Liège – also have women's events. A women's version of Milan–San Remo, named Primavera Rosa, was initiated in 1999, but cancelled after 2005.\n\n\n"}

Etymologically, it descends from a number of Arabic texts of the period of the Califate which use the term \"al-tannoor\" in talismanic alchemy, meaning a bread-oven, from which the design portrayed evidently descends.\n\nThe athanor was also called Piger Henricus (\"Slow Henry\"), because it was chiefly used in slower operations, and because when once filled with coals, it keeps burning a long time. For this reason the Greeks referred to it as \"giving no trouble\", as it did not need to be continually attended. It was also called the Philosophical furnace, Furnace of Arcana, or popularly, the Tower furnace.\n\nIn the work \"Life of Apollonius\" by Philostratus the Athenian, an allegorical description is given of an occult hill. The author gives this hill the name \"Athanor\".\n\nAthanor is also the name of two works by Anselm Kiefer: one currently displayed in the Toledo Museum of Art and the other commissioned by the Louvre museum in 2007 and displayed there.\n\nAthanor is also the title of a 1968 book of poetry by the Romanian author Gellu Naum\n\nAthanor is also the name of a musical work for orchestra by French composer Joël-François Durand, written in 2001 and premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra (cond. Pierre-André Valade), in 2003.\n\nAthanor is also the name a series by American author Jane Lindskold. The titles in this series are \"Changer\", published in 1996, and \"Legends Walking\", published in 1999.\n\nAthanor is also the title of an artwork by Romanian artist Geta Bratescu (b. 1926), consisting of a photo collage dated from 1974 and currently part of the art collection of Instituto Inhotim, in Brazil.\n\nAthanor is also the title of an artwork by Janet Saad-Cook located at Boston University's Photonics Center.\n\nThe Athanor Academy of Performing Arts Passau founded in 1995 in the German town Passau is also named after this furnace.\n\n, Masonic Lodge ()\n\nIn EVE Online there is a structure called the Athanor that can be anchored by players.\n\n\"Athanor\" is now a review of language philosophy, history, and international politics.

The walk finishes at Sholing railway station. The route has been promoted by the Eastleigh Group of the Ramblers with grant aid from Hampshire County Council and Eastleigh Borough Council. The route was altered and improved in 2008.\nThe northern part of the path is within the South Downs National Park and follows the valley of the River Itchen from close to its source at Hinton Ampner. The route passes the springs at the head of the river, before running through New Cheriton, Cheriton. At Tichborne, after touching the edge of New Alresford, the path cuts the corner to Ovington. The river is crossed several times, to Itchen Stoke, Avington and Itchen Abbas. From here the path stays on the right bank to Martyr Worthy. \n\nBetween Martyr Worthy and Abbots Worthy the Itchen Way, King's Way, St. Swithun's Way and Three Castles Path form a network either side of the river, allowing various routes to be followed. \n\nFrom Martyr Worthy the waymarked Itchen Way crosses the river twice to loop through Easton. Back on the right bank the path passes through a tunnel under the M3 motorway to Abbots Worthy, before again crossing the Itchen to join the Three Castles Path (St. Swithun's way and King's Way continuing to Winchester on the right bank). Heading south the Itchen Way passes under the A34 before running parallel with the former route of the former Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway between the Winnall Moors nature reserve and the Winnall industrial estate. After a short section along roads it enters Winchester at Durngate. The route then passes along the river through the historic centre of Winchester before following the Itchen Navigation, again running parallel with the former railway past the foot of St. Catherine's Hill.\n\nAfter again passing under the M3 at the foot of Twyford Down, the Navigation and path cross to the west of the river, past Shawford, Otterbourne and Allbrook, Eastleigh and Bishopstoke. A short diversion beyond Bishopstoke gives access to Itchen Valley Country Park. South of the M27 the path crosses the western suburbs of Southampton. From the mouth of the river at Weston Point, Woolston, an extension of the path runs inland to Millers Pond and Sholing station. \n\nHowever, taking this route back-to-front, ie South to North will take a rambler from urban Southampton into the countryside and the route ends at the Wayfarer's Walk which enables the journey to be extended.\n\nBetween Weston Shore and the Itchen Toll Bridge the path shares its route with the Solent Way. The northern end joins the Wayfarers Walk. The path also crosses, joins or shares sections of route with a number of long distance paths converging on Winchester, including the South Downs Way, Clarendon Way, King's Way, Pilgrims' Trail, St. Swithun's Way and Three Castles Path. The Monarch's Way crosses at Shawford.\n\nThe footpath is waymarked by metal disks attached to wooden posts and adhesive stickers and these show a yellow arrow on a dark green background and the words The Itchen Way in the yellow arrow. Between these waymarks there are intermediate standard footpath waymarks bearing the Hampshire County Council logo. There is only limited waymarking in the urban area of Winchester. In Southampton it is waymarked by adhesive stickers on street furniture with the approval of Southampton City Council.\n\nThe path crosses a variety of rural and urban landscapes. These include watercress beds and water meadows along the upper river, the historic centre of Winchester and the Iron-Age fort of St Catherine's Hill. Along other parts of the route are remains of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway including Hockley Railway Viaduct, and former locks on the Navigation. Landmarks further south include Southampton Airport and the Itchen toll Bridge. At the southern end are views of Southampton Docks and the Solent and Isle of Wight.\n\nThe southern starting point is Sholing station. Villages along the route between New Cheriton and Winchester are served by the 67 bus to Winchester and Petersfield, both of which have main line stations; service 64 also links New Alresford to Winchester and Alton. There are also stations close to the route at Bitterne, Eastleigh and Shawford.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810770", "title": "Entroncamento", "text": "Entroncamento\n\nEntroncamento () is a Portuguese municipality in district of Santarém in the Médio Tejo Subregion (\"Middle Tagus\") of the Centro Region. The population in 2011 was 20,206, in an area of 13.73 km². Situated in the Ribatejo, it benefits from its geo-strategic position along the Tagus Valley, with important accessibility to the motorways and railway-lines that historically proportioned its growth and expansion.\n\nEntroncamento originated in the middle of the 19th century, with the birth of the national railway network, as a simple train-stop, from two small railway construction camps: Casal das Vaginhas and Casal das Gouveias. The majority of the early rail workers/settlers were foreign, coming from different countries throughout Europe, but eventually workers from Beira Baixa and Alentejo moved to the region.\n\nIts toponymic name \"Entroncamento\" literally mean \"junction\", owing to being the junction of the two railway lines that developed in 1864: the \"Linha do Norte\" (\"Northern Line\") and the \"Linha do Leste\" (\"Eastern Line\"). Hinged between its links with the east and Beira Baixa, the station at Entroncamento, for many decades, was the obligatory stop that moved goods and people to the north and east. During this time, many celebrated travellers from Europe used the Eastern, dining in the station en route, such as the literary celebrates Hans Christian Andersen, Ramalho Ortigão, Eça de Queiroz, Alberto Pimentel, Luísa de Freitas Lomelino and Eduardo Meneres. Political leaders also became frequent visitors both before and after the 25 April Revolution, such as João Chagas, politician and journalist, who travelled to Lisbon in order to assume the direction of the new government, after the dictatorship of General Pimenta de Castro. \nFor a long time, the two settlements were divided between two neighbouring municipalities, because the rail-line itself determined its boundary. To the west of the lines were the parishes of Santiago (in Torres Novas) and to the east the territory was part of the parish of Nossa Senhora da Assunção da Atalaia (municipality of Vila Nova da Barquinha). The small settlement continued growing, owing to the development of rail transport and support structures, later the installation of military quarters (after 1916) determined the geographic accessibility, resulting in further influx of families.\n\nOn August 25, 1926, the settlement was recognised with the status of civil parish. By 1932 Entroncamento was bestowed the urban designation of \"vila\" (\"town\") and on November 24, 1945, it was elevated to the status of municipality. Until this date, its route to urban autonomy was a progressive emancipation, first separating from Torres Novas, and later from Barquinha: back then, it was also quite uncommon for a settlement to transform from village to town, then municipality, all within one century. From the small nucleus of families that started to populate the area, the 1930s registered approximately 3000 inhabitants and by 1945 there were 8000 residents. In March 2005, it was estimated the total population included 18,780 residents (calculation based on the number of election-age residents). The growth in the population and expansion resulted in the creation of two new civil parishes: Nossa Senhora de Fátima, to the west of the line, and São João Baptista, to the east.\n\nIn the 1950s, Entroncamento was, after Barreiro, the second largest railway centre, with almost half of its national employees. It was estimated that between the 1920s and 1930s, the Entroncamento population associated with the railway operator, CP Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses /Comboios de Portugal exceeded 50% of the local population. CP's corporate social responsibility program included the establishment of urban infrastructures to support its working population by the construction of neighbourhoods, building a school and warehousing, environmental work such as planting vegetation as well as acting as a health center and dispensing anti-tuberculosis drugs to the citizens in need and additionally supporting sport activities. In parallel, the evolution of railway services along with supporting technologies, helped to reinforce the level of education and training, resulting in the creation of teaching centres such as FERNAVE, a subsidiary technical center that also worked in partnership with the \"Instituto Superior de Transportes\" (Superior Institute of Transportation). \nAfter the 1970s, changes begun to occur with the gradual substitution of coal-powered steam locomotives to diesel and electric equipment. The introduction of new technologies, brought about the unemployment of some workers, while the subsequent transformation of the company from labour-intensive methods to the newest technology-related services, offered others new opportunities. Lately, while Entroncamento continues to have an elevated number of professionals associated with the rail industry, its economic activities have shifted to commerce and the service sectors as well as industries associated with civil construction. The INE \"\"Instituto Nacional de Estatísticas\"\" statistics for 2004, indicated that Entroncamento continued to be the region with the largest purchasing power in the district of Santarém.\n\nConscious of its historical underpinnings, on November 24, 2004, the Entroncamento municipal authorities celebrating its anniversary, revised its municipal plan to include the construction of the \"Museu Nacional Ferroviário Armando Ginestal Machado\" and the creation of a foundation to manage its affairs, an aspiration that had been proposed in the 1970s.\n\nThe municipality is surrounded by the neighbouring municipalities of Golegã (to the south), Torres Novas (to the west and north) and the municipality of Vila Nova da Barquinha (to the east); its centre is from the centre of Torres Novas, from Tomar, from Santarém and from the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.\n\nThe growth rate, between 1981 and 1991, was 18.1%, considered the most elevated in the \"Médio Tejo\" region, contradicting the national trend towards aging. Between 1991 and 1996, the population grew from 14,226 inhabitants to 15,500, although a lower growth rate (9%) than previously, it was still the community with the highest urban population density in the \"Médio Tejo\" region. The estimated current population (18,780), does not include residents still registered as living in other localities, nor fluctuating numbers of temporary workers. Effectively, Entroncamento maintains a population of over 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe municipality consists of two civil parishes (\"freguesias\") that are principally divided by the national railway-line that crosses its territory from south-southwest to north-northeast:\n\nAlong with its fraternal sister-city of Penafiel, Entroncamento is twinned with:\n\n\nThe municipality decided to invest heavily in the implementation of primary fiber optic infrastructure links that can connect all municipal services, such as parish councils, sports complex, sports hall, schools, assembly chamber, library, cultural center and additionally, future needs capacity to also enable installation of telemetry systems, video surveillance set up and the possible requirements for a FTTH network.\n- Fibra no Entroncamento\n\n"}

Amesbury's 2017 win was one of 30 net gains of the Labour Party, three of which came from the county Cheshire.\n\nThe seat has been considered relative to others a marginal seat, as well as a swing seat, since 2005 as its winner's majority has not exceeded 7.8% of the vote since the 17.4% majority won in 2005 and the seat has changed hands twice since that year.\n\n1997–2010: The District of Vale Royal wards of Castle, Church, Forest, Frodsham East, Frodsham North West, Frodsham South, Gorst Wood, Hartford, Helsby Central, Helsby North, Helsby South and Alvanley Ward, Kingsley, Milton, Northwich, Weaver, Winnington, Witton North, and Witton South, and the Borough of Halton wards of Brookfields, Castlefields, Clough, Daresbury, Murdishaw, and Norton.\n\n2010–present: The Cheshire West and Chester wards of Forest, Frodsham North, Frodsham South, Hartford and Whitegate, Helsby, Kingsley, Davenham, Leftwich and Kingsmead, Milton Weaver, Northwich Castle, Northwich Winnington, Northwich Witton, and Weaverham, and the Borough of Halton wards of Beechwood, Daresbury, Halton Lea, Norton North, Norton South, and Windmill Hill.\n\nThe constituency covers the northern part of the Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority in Cheshire, including the towns of Northwich and Frodsham and the villages of Helsby and Weaverham. It also includes part of the borough of Halton, covering the easternmost suburbs of Runcorn.\n\nWeaver Vale was created in 1997 from parts of Eddisbury, Tatton, Halton, and Warrington South, when the number of constituencies in Cheshire was increased from 10 to 11.\n\nFrom the 1997 general election, the seat was held by the Labour Party's Mike Hall, who first entered Parliament in 1992 for Warrington South.

Graham Evans (Conservative) held the seat from 2010-2017. The present MP is Mike Amesbury (Labour), elected during the 2017 general election and was returned with a reduced majority in 2019.\n\nThe area has economic sectors as diverse as plastics and chemicals to construction. Other areas include telecommunications/bank communication centres, with in addition, a large national bakery and a supermarket distribution centre. Salt used to comprise a major mining industry of the area, much more of which is extracted today from large reserves in Northern Ireland. Workless claimants who were registered jobseekers were in November 2012 slightly higher than the national average of 3.8%, at 4.1% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\". This was, however, lower than the regional average of 4.4%.

The details of his life known today come primarily from \"The Life of St. Gerald of Aurillac\" (c. 930–931) written by Odo of Cluny.\nWriting twenty years after the event, Abbot Odo of Cluny described how William, duke of Aquitaine, had entreated Gerald to abandon the \"militia regia\", the feudal service performed directly to the king and pay homage to himself, \"for the sake of love\". Gerald resisted, having recently assumed the title of \"comes\" and doubtless preferring to own his fealty to the more distant liege, the king at Paris.\n\nAccording to Odo, Gerald suffered an illness as a child, sufficient in duration to advance his reading, and may have been disfigured by acne. In later life he was to suffer blindness. He seriously considered joining a religious order, but was persuaded against it by his friend Geusbert, Bishop of Rodez, on the grounds that with his social position he could do more good by remaining in the world as a layman. Nevertheless, secretly tonsured under his habitual cap, he consecrated his life in service to God, gave away his possessions, took a personal vow of chastity and prayed the breviary each day.\n\nHe founded a church and abbey on his estate of Aurillac, where he was buried after dying at Cenezac, on a Friday 13 October, probably in 909. His memorial feast day is October 13. The validation of his local cult by Odo of Cluny served to establish his wider veneration. Saint Gerald, considered by his Church and his followers as a great example of a celibate Christian aristocrat, is the patron saint of counts and bachelors. Because of his poor health and blindness, more emphasized in his developing cult than in Odo's \"Life\", he is also the patron saint of the disabled, handicapped, and physically challenged. He also became the patron saint of Upper Auvergne.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees.\n\nRing was born in La Mesa, California. He graduated from Monte Vista High School (Spring Valley, California) and attended San Diego State University where he was a star closer.\n\nHe was selected by the Chicago White Sox as the 18th overall pick in the first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nIn 2003, Ring was acquired by the Mets with Edwin Almonte and Andrew Salvo in the trade that sent Roberto Alomar and cash to the White Sox. Ring's performance suffered in the 2004 season and, for a time, he was no longer considered a top prospect. This was evidenced by the fact that the Mets left him unprotected in the Rule 5 draft. Part of Ring's problem was his nonchalant attitude about physical fitness, as he gained body fat during his career downturn.\n\nHowever, after a surprisingly strong spring training and minor league showing in 2005, Ring was added to the Mets' Major League roster and made his Major League debut on April 29 against the Washington Nationals. He posted a disappointing 5.06 ERA before being demoted to the minor leagues later in the season. Ring changed his pitching motion and received better results. He was recalled to the big leagues on August 2, 2006, but was sent back to Triple-A Norfolk three weeks later to make room on the 25-man roster for newly acquired Shawn Green.\n\nOn November 15, 2006, Ring was traded along with Heath Bell to the San Diego Padres for outfielder Ben Johnson and reliever Jon Adkins. Ring pitched in 15 games for the Padres.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, Ring was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Wilfredo Ledezma and pitching prospect Will Startup, and then was optioned to the Triple-A Richmond Braves. He was called up when the rosters expanded on September 1. In 2008, Ring had an 8.46 ERA and was designated for assignment in August 2008. He cleared waivers and was assigned to Triple-A Richmond. He became a free agent at the end of the season.\n\nOn January 5, 2009, Ring signed a one-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals. However, he was placed on outright waivers on March 25, and accepted a Triple-A assignment to the Memphis Redbirds.\n\nOn January 12, 2010, Ring signed a minor league contract with an invite to spring training with the New York Yankees. Though he impressed the Yankees in spring training, he was optioned to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Triple-A season, the Yankees purchased Ring's contract and promoted him to the major leagues.\n\nHe pitched in 5 games for the Yankees, allowing 4 runs in less than 3 innings.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, Ring signed a minor league contract for the 2011 season with the Seattle Mariners with an invitation to spring training. However, he did not make the Mariners out of spring training, and he was sent to the minors on March 27. He opted out of his contract on July 3 after posting an ERA of 6.08 in 27 games.\n\nRing signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on July 20, 2011.

From the late 1940s until the early 1970s he was heard in numerous radio programs and voiceovers for television commercials, the later of which he resumed in the 1980s and 90s. In the early 1970s he moved into acting and from 1977 to 1982 held perhaps his most known role, that of Managing Editor Charlie Hume on \"Lou Grant\". He also acted in numerous other television and movie roles, most prominently \"\" (1981) and \"F/X\" (1986).\n\nAdams was born in Brooklyn, New York. He earned an MA degree from the University of Michigan in Theatre Arts and Speech and also attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, studying theater arts. He made his stage debut in 1940, appearing in summer stock at Baltimore's Hilltop Theater.\n\nAdams was heard on many radio programs during Radio's Golden Age. A notable recurring role was that of Pepper Young in \"Pepper Young's Family\", which aired from 1947 to 1959. He also portrayed the deadly Nazi Atom Man in a classic 1945 serial on the radio version of \"The Adventures of Superman\". \n\nDuring the 1960s, Adams was ubiquitous as a voiceover actor in television commercials for foods and household products, most notably for Chiffon margarine and Crest toothpaste (\"Helps stop cavities \"before\" they start\"). He also did the vocal part of the television commercials for Smucker's preserves (\"With a name like Smucker's, it has to be good!\"), a role he resumed in his later years. \n\nHis voiceover work resumed in the 1980s when he began providing the voiceover for Cadbury Creme eggs, which were advertised on television with Adams' catchy slogan, \"Nobunny knows Easter better than him [the Cadbury Bunny].\" Also in the 1980s, Adams did voice-over TV commercials for Sherwin-Williams Paints, as well as radio commercials for the Salvation Army. In addition, Adams was the narrator for Kix commercials in the 1990s as well as a few Dentyne commercials and a few Swanson commercials. He was also the announcer for a 1992 WCBS-TV news promo, as well as a 1986 Lysol commercial. In the early 1990s, he narrated \"Frontiers of Flight\", a Discovery Channel series on milestones of aviation. In one of the early episodes of \"Sesame Street\", he voiced a cartoon featuring a \"jazzy\" triangle and a \"square\" square. He voiced those two, as well as being the narrator, with jazz music in the background. This cartoon was repeated on the show for many years, well into the 1980s.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Adams was a co-star of the NBC soap opera \"Another World\" and in 1976 he was in the original 1976 Broadway cast for \"Checking Out\". Following that he landed perhaps his most famous role, Managing Editor Charlie Hume in the television series \"Lou Grant\", which aired from 1977 to 1982. Appearing in the show for its entire run, he landed three straight Emmy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in 1979, 1980 and 1981, each year alongside his \"Lou Grant\" co-star Robert Walden, who played reporter Joe Rossi. During his run on \"Lou Grant\", Adams performed perhaps his most often seen role, as the US president in \"\" (1981). He also appeared in popular TV movies, such as \"The Deadliest Season\" (1977), \"Revenge of the Stepford Wives\" (1980) and \"The Kid with the Broken Halo\" (1982).\n\nIn 1983, Adams joined The Mirror Theater Ltd's Mirror Repertory Company for their first repertory season, appearing in \"Paradise Lost\", \"Rain\", \"Inheritors\", and \"The Hasty Heart\". This season was presented initially Off-Off-Broadway at The Real Stage Acting School and was moved Off-Broadway to the Theatre at St. Peter's Church. In 1986, he starred as Col. Edward Mason, one of his most famous feature film roles, in the movie \"F/X\" starring Bryan Brown and Brian Dennehy, and in 1991 he appeared in the action movie \"Toy Soldiers\". \n\nIn 1993, Adams starred as Walter Warner Sr. in the movie \"Son in Law\" starring Pauly Shore, and after that he had roles in \"Houseguest\" (1995), \"Touch\" (1997) and \"The Lesser Evil\" (1998). In the 1998 HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\" he played Senator Clinton P. Anderson. His final role was in the series finale of \"Oz\".\n\nMason Adams played many characters in Old-Time Radio programs, amongst them:\n\nAdams achieved a bit of holiday immortality by taking part in a comedy spoof of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\", called \"The Chickens Are in the Chimes\" (RCA Victor 74-8277, 1963). Recorded by Sascha Burland and the Skipjack Choir, with Adams as the lead voice, this recording was released on a 45 rpm record but has never been released on compact disc. The recording for the “B” side was \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\".\n\n\"The Chickens Are in the Chimes\" has often been played over radio stations at Christmas, and became a holiday favorite ever since.\n\nAdams married Margot Fineberg in 1958. The couple had a daughter, Betsy, and a son, Bill. \n<br> Mason died on April 26, 2005, from natural causes.\n\n"}

This discovery is recognized as the birth of spintronics, a research field which is often described as a new type of electronics exploiting not only the electric charge of the electrons but also their magnetism (their spin). Spintronics has already important applications. One knows that the introduction of GMR read heads in hard disks has led to a considerable increase of their capacity of information storage. Other spintronic properties are exploited in the M-RAM that are expected to impact soon the technology of the computers and phones. Albert Fert had many contributions to the development of spintronics and, after his 2007 Nobel Prize, he is exploring the emerging direction of the exploitation of topological properties in spintronics. His most recent works are on the topologically protected magnetic solitons called skyrmions and on the conversion between charge and spin current by topological insulators.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810817", "title": "Marwar", "text": "Marwar\n\nMarwar (also called Jodhpur region) is a region of southwestern Rajasthan state in North Western India. It lies partly in the Thar Desert. The word 'maru' is Sanskrit for desert. In Rajasthani dialect, \"wad\" means a particular area. English translation of the word 'marwar' is 'the region of desert.'\n\nThe region includes the present-day districts of Barmer, Jalore, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali and parts of Sikar . It is bounded on the north by Jangladesh region, on the northeast by Dhundhar, on the east by Ajmer, on the southeast by Mewar, on the south by Godwar, on the southwest by Sindh, and on the west by Jaisalmer region.\n\nIn 1901 the region (Jodhpur state) had an area of 93,424 km2.\n\nMarwar is a sandy plain lying northwest of the Aravalli Range, which runs southwest-northeast through Rajasthan state. The Aravallis wring much of the moisture from the southwest monsoon, which provides most of India's rainfall. Annual rainfall is low, ranging from 10 cm to 40 cm. Temperatures range from 48 to 50 degrees Celsius in the summer, to below freezing point in winter. The northwestern thorn scrub forests lie next to the Aravalli Range, while the rest of the region lies in the Thar Desert.\n\nThe Luni River is the principal feature of the Marwar plains. It originates in the sacred Pushkar Lake of Ajmer District, and the main river flows through Marwar in a south-westerly direction until it finally disappears into the seasonal wetland of the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. It is fed by tributaries that flow from the Aravallis. Irrigation from the river, and from wells near the river, support crops of wheat and barley.\n\nThe sandy tracts of Thar Desert in western Marwar [Maru Pradesh] are characterized by a harsh physical geography and a fragile ecology. High wind velocity, shifting sand dunes and very deep and saline water sources pose a challenge to sustained human habitation in the Thar.\n\nThe area is prone to devastating droughts. The Thar Desert is one of the most inhospitable landscapes on earth. Apart from the huge distances between hamlets and settlements here, the landscape is constantly shifting with the sand, as wind and sandstorms re-arrange the landscape. This, added to the lack of water in such an arid region, means that the villagers often find themselves migrating on foot across hundreds of miles towards neighboring states in search of water.\n\nHieun Tsang described a kingdom in Rajasthan which he calls \"Ku-cha-lo\" (or Gurjara) largely because the whole of the marwar area of rajasthan was more or less identified with the Gurjars, as early as the 6th or 7th century. The Gurjara Pratihara, established a kingdom in Marwar in the 6th century, with a capital at Mandore, 9 km from present-day Jodhpur. The ruined city of Osian or Ossian, 65 km from Jodhpur, was an important religious centre of the Pratihara period. The royal Rathore family of Jodhpur claim descent from the famous Rashtrakuta dynasty. On the fall of the Rashtrakuta dynasty they migrated north to Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Jodhpur state was founded in the 13th century by the Rathore clan of Rajputs. After the sacking of Kannauj by Muhammad of Ghor in 1194, and its capture by the Delhi Sultanate in the early 13th century, the Rathores fled west. The Rathore family chronicles relate that Siyaji, grandson of Jai Chandra, the last Gahadvala king of Kannauj, came to Marwar on a pilgrimage to Dwarka in Gujarat. On halting at the town of Pali he and his followers settled there to protect the Brahmin community from the raids of marauding bands. The brahmans of Pali requested Siyaji to settle in Pali and become their king. Rao (king) Chanda, tenth in succession from Siyaji, finally wrested control of Mandore and much of Marwar from the Turks with help of the Parihars. The city of Jodhpur, capital of the Rathor state and now a district administrative centre, was founded in 1459 by Rao Chanda's successor Rao Jodha.\n\nIn 1561 the kingdom was invaded by the Mughal emperor Akbar. Rao Maldev Rathore was forced to send tribute under his son Udai Singh as a mark of homage. After a war for almost two decades and the death of Rao Chandrasen Rathore in 1581, Marwar was brought under direct Mughal administration and remained so till 1583, when Udai Singh ascended to the throne.\n\nIn 1679 CE, when Maharaja Jaswant Singh whom Emperor Aurangzeb had posted at Jamrud at the mouth of the Khyber Pass, died at that place, leaving no son to succeed him; his widowed \"Ranis\" (Queens) at Lahore gave birth to two sons. One died and the other survived to secure the throne of Marwar and to stir up the sentiments of his co-religionists against the Muslim Monarch. The family of the late Raja had left Jamrud without the permission of the emperor and killed an officer at Attock when asked to produce a passport. This was a sufficient ground for incorporating Marwar in the Mughal Empire, or reducing it to a state of dependency under a capable ruler. So the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb invaded Marwar in 1679. Durgadas Rathore led a rebellion against the Mughals which lasted for 31 years. After the death of Aurangzeb, Durgadas captured Jodhpur and evicted the Mughal garrison from Marwar.\nAll the Rajput clans united due to the aggressive behavior of the Mughal emperor. A triple alliance was formed by the states of Jodhpur kingdom, Udaipur (Mewar ) and Jaipur Kingdom to become independent from the Mughal Empire. One of the conditions of this alliance was that the rulers of Jodhpur and Jaipur should regain the privilege of marriage with the ruling Sisodia dynasty of Mewar, which they had forfeited by contracting alliances with the Mughal emperors, on the understanding that the offspring of Sisodia princesses should succeed to the state in preference to all other children. The quarrels arising from this stipulation lasted through many generations. It led to the invitation of Maratha help from the rival aspirants to power and, finally, to the subjection of all the Rajput states to the Marathas. Marwar was invaded by Sindhias, who after the Battle at Merta, levied a tribute of 60 lakh rupees, and took from it the fort and town of Ajmer.\n\nInternecine disputes and succession wars disturbed the peace of the early years of the century, until in January 1818 Jodhpur was brought under British control. Jodhpur became a princely state in the Rajputana Agency of British India.\n\nThe state was bounded on the north by Bikaner state, on the northeast by Jaipur state, on the west by the British province of Ajmer, on the southeast by Mewar (Udaipur) state, on the south by Sirohi state and the Banas Kantha Agency of Bombay Presidency, on the southwest by Sind Province, and on the west by Jaisalmer State. The Rathore Maharaja was the head of state, with an aristocracy of Jagirdars, Jamidars and Thakurs. There were 22 parganas and 4500 villages in the state.\n\nIn 1839 the British intervened to quell an insurrection. In 1843, when Maharaja Man Singh (ruled 1803–1843) died without a son and without having adopted an heir. The nobles and state officials were left to select a successor from the nearest of kin. Their choice fell upon Raja Takht Singh of Ahmednagar. Maharaja Takht Singh, who supported the British during the Revolt of 1857, died in 1873. His successor, Maharaja Jaswant Singh II, who died in 1896, was a very enlightened ruler. His brother, Sir Pratap Singh, conducted the administration until his nephew, Sardar Singh, came of age in 1898. Maharaja Sardar Singh ruled until 1911. The imperial service cavalry formed part of the reserve brigade during the Tirah campaign.\n\nMarwar suffered more severely than any other part of Rajputana from the famine of 1899–1900. In February 1900 more than 110,000 people were in receipt of famine relief. The kingdom had a population of 1,935,565 in 1901, a 23% decline from the 1891, largely due to the results of the famine.\n\nIts ruler, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, expressed a wish to join the Dominion of Pakistan but Lord Mountbatten warned him that his subjects were mostly Hindus and his accession to Pakistan would create problems. As a result, Jodhpur, too, acceded to India.\n\nIn 1949 Maharaja Hanwant Singh acceded to the Government of India; in 1950 Rajputana became the state of Rajasthan.\n\n<nowiki>Jat [[Jat]];[[yellow]][[50%]]</nowiki>\n\n\n"}

The largest town in the constituency, Barrow-in-Furness, grew on the back of the shipbuilding industry and is now the site of the BAE Systems nuclear submarine and shipbuilding operation. This reliance on a single industry associated with controversial defence policies has proved politically volatile in a constituency the Labour Party would consider its own backyard. Labour Cabinet member Albert Booth represented Barrow from 1966 for many years but was defeated in 1983, in the aftermath of the Falklands War, by a Manchester lawyer, Cecil Franks of the Conservative Party, who retained the seat until 1992. Local media attributed this to widespread fears of job losses because the Labour Party was then signed up to doing away with all its nuclear capabilities including the submarines.\n\nAs Labour revised its policies by favouring the retention of Britain's nuclear capability, and following massive job losses in the town's shipbuilding industry, Labour's fortunes revived in Barrow. John Hutton took the seat back for Labour in 1992 and retained it until the 2010 general election, when he was replaced by John Woodcock, also of Labour. In 2001, Hutton had the support of more than half of all those who voted. Other industries in the constituency currently include engineering and chemicals, and more than a quarter of all jobs are in manufacturing. The 2015 result gave the seat the 10th-smallest majority of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.

She was the political leader of her party from 2007 to 2014, and served as Minister of Economic Affairs and the Interior from 2011 to 2014. She has been described as \"the rich world’s most powerful trustbuster\".\n\nVestager was born in Glostrup, Zealand, a daughter of Lutheran ministers Hans Vestager and Bodil Tybjerg. She matriculated from Varde Upper Secondary school in 1986. She studied at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1993 with a degree in Economics. Vestager speaks Danish, English and some French.\n\nVestager has been a professional politician since the age of 21, when she was appointed to the central board and executive committee of the SLP and its European Affairs Committee, and shortly afterwards as National Chairwoman of the Party.\n\nIn 2001, Vestager was elected to the Danish Parliament, becoming Chairwoman of its Parliamentary Group in 2007. She was appointed Minister of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs in 1998.\n\nOn 15 June 2007 Vestager secured election as her Party's parliamentary group leader in the Folketing, replacing Marianne Jelved. When Denmark's Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen called an early election in 2011 after failing to secure majority lawmaker backing for his economic stimulus package, Vestager's Social Liberals and the Conservative People's Party formed a political alliance, pledging to work together no matter which political bloc would win the election.\n\nFrom 2011 until 2014 Vestager served as Minister for Economic and Interior Affairs in the three-party Social Democrat-led coalition government of Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Having forced through deep cuts in unemployment benefits of Denmark's generous social welfare system after the country's economy narrowly escaped recession in 2012, she was at one point considered by Danish media and pollsters as the most powerful person in government, even above Thorning-Schmidt.\n\nIn her time in office, chaired the meetings of economic and finance ministers of the European Union (ECOFIN) during Denmark's presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2012. In this capacity, she announced that the European Union would cede two of its seats on the board of the International Monetary Fund to emerging economies under a new power-sharing scheme for international financial institutions. She also worked closely with Jean-Claude Juncker to salvage Europe's financial sector and forge a European Banking Union.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Vestager led Denmark's campaign against Basel III liquidity rules, arguing in favor of allowing banks to use 75 percent more in covered bonds to fill liquidity buffers than allowed under Basel III rules; at the time Denmark's $550 billion mortgage-backed covered bond market, part of the country's two-century-old mortgage system, was the world's largest per capita. In 2013 she ruled out slowing down steps toward stricter requirements for systemically important lenders and reiterated her stance that banks won't get tax breaks to help them through the transition caused by regulatory reform.\n\nIn May 2014, Vestager presented a growth package designed to drag Denmark's economy – at the time Scandinavia's weakest – out of its crisis, raising the country's structural output by 6 billion kroner ($1.1 billion) and cut costs for companies by 4 billion kroner in 2020 through 89 measures to improve the business climate and boost employment.\n\nOn 31 August 2014, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt nominated Vestager as Denmark's EU Commissioner in the Juncker Commission. Despite her repeated denials of campaigning for the Environment portfolio, eventually she was designated the Competition dossier in the Juncker Commission. On 3 October 2014, she won the European Parliament's backing following her confirmation hearing.\n\nIn her confirmation hearings, Vestager said she favored settlement of cases before they come to a final executive judgment, for reduced fines or negotiated concessions from the companies.\n\nLike her predecessor, Joaquín Almunia, Vestager has since been focusing on state aid cases. Within a few months in the office, she brought antitrust charges against Google; Almunia had initially opened the investigation into Google in 2010, and had reached a settlement deal with Google by 2014 but was unable to convince the European Commission to accept it before his term ended. Vestager inherited Almunia's case but has shown greater desire to continue pursuing Google/Alphabet over the alleged antitrust violations. Also, she initiated investigations into the tax affairs of Fiat, Starbucks, Amazon.com and Apple Inc. under competition rules. In 2014, she launched proceedings against Gazprom, one of Europe's main gas suppliers, over allegations of breaching EU antitrust rules by putting in place artificial barriers to trade with eight European countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.\n\nIn January 2015, Vestager ordered Cyprus Airways to pay back over 65 million euros in illegal state aid received in 2012 and 2013 as part of a restructuring package; as a consequence, Cyprus suspended operations at its flag carrier resulting in 550 job losses and reduced competition.\n\nIn August 2016, after a two–year investigation, Vestager announced Apple Inc. received illegal tax benefits from Ireland. The Commission ordered Apple to pay a fine of €13 billion, plus interest, in unpaid Irish taxes for 2004–2014; the largest tax fine in history. As a result of the EU investigation, Apple agreed to re-structure out of its 2004–2014 Irish BEPS tool, the Double Irish in Q1 2015; Apple's replacement Irish BEPS tool, the CAIA arrangement caused Irish 2015 GDP to rise by 34.4 per cent, and was labelled Leprechaun economics by Nobel Prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman in July 2016.\n\nIn July 2017, a fine of $2.7 billion against Alphabet (formerly Google) was levied based on the European Commission claim that Google breached antitrust rules. This fine was later appealed.\n\nIn October 2017, Vestager ordered Amazon to pay €250 million of back taxes, and in January 2018, the EU Commission fined Qualcomm €997 million for allegedly abusing its market dominance on LTE baseband chipsets.\nIn July 2018, she fined Alphabet (Google) €4.3 billion for entrenching its dominance in internet search by illegally tying together their service and other mobile apps with Android. On 22 January 2019 she fined Mastercard €570 million for preventing European retailers from shopping around for better payment terms. In March 2019, Vestager ordered Google to pay a fine €1.49 billion for abusive practices in online advertising. Vestager's work as competition commissioner received criticism from US President Donald Trump (who also dubbed her as the EU's \"Tax Lady\"), stating \"\"She hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I’ve ever met.\"\"\n\nFollowing the 2019 European Parliament election, Vestager was proposed as President of the European Commission. In June 2019, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen proposed that Vestager continue as Denmark's Commissioner for another five years. While, initially thought to become First Vice-President, Ursula von der Leyen has since proposed that Vestager, Frans Timmermans and Valdis Dombrovskis all serve as Executive Vice-Presidents of the Commission with Vestager having responsibility for a \"Europe fit for the Digital Age\".\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Vestager held that “[in] our experience it’s impossible to pursue Danish interests without being close to the core of Europe. You don’t have influence or produce results if you’re standing on the sideline.”\n\nVestager's husband is a gymnasium maths-and-philosophy teacher. They have three daughters, Maria, Rebecca, and Ella. Vestager served as an inspiration for the main character in \"Borgen\", who tries to juggle family life and politics.\n\n\n"}

Written by series creator Joss Whedon and directed and co-written by Jeffrey Bell, it was originally broadcast on May 19, 2004 on the WB network. In \"Not Fade Away\", Angel convinces his team that they must take out every member of the Circle of the Black Thorn in a defiant and probably futile stand against the Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart. He tells his team to make the most of what may be their last day on Earth: Gunn visits his old neighborhood; Wesley tends to the wounded Illyria; Lorne spends some time onstage; Spike performs poetry at an open mic, and Angel visits his son. When night falls, the team divides and sets out to eliminate the members of the Black Thorn, incurring the wrath of the armies of hell.\n\nAngel briefs his team on his plan to kill all the members of the Circle of the Black Thorn. Marcus Hamilton calls Angel to an emergency meeting of the circle, where the other members express doubts about Angel's loyalties. Angel proves himself to them by irrevocably renouncing his role in the Shanshu Prophecy, thereby giving up his chance to become human.\n\nBack at Wolfram & Hart, Angel meets with his old enemy Lindsey McDonald and enlists him in the planned attack on the Circle. He then tells the rest of his group that the plan will proceed that night. Angel advises his friends to spend the rest of the day as if it were their last since it \"probably is.\"\n\nAngel visits his son, Connor. Connor reveals that he knows that Angel is his father; his old memories are now \"mixed in\" with his new ones, and he understands and appreciates why Angel gave him new memories.\n\nLorne has serious reservations about Angel's plan, and his mood is dark and somber. Lindsey spends the day with Eve, who is suspicious of Angel even though Lindsey now trusts him. Gunn spends his day helping Anne at the homeless shelter that she maintains. Spike goes to a seedy bar, drinks heavily, and heads onstage to recite a poem – one that he originally recited in 1880. Wesley spends his day in his apartment tending to Illyria's wounds, telling her there is nothing else he wants and nowhere for him to be. She offers to comfort him in Fred's form, but he refuses the offer.\n\nThe team splits up to attack members of the Circle separately, making plans to reunite if they survive their missions. As they leave, Lorne tells Angel that this is the last thing he's going to do for him; that afterwards, they will not see him again. Hamilton, warned of the plan by Harmony, confronts Angel – intent on stopping his plan to kill the Circle's leader. Angel reveals that he has already poisoned Archduke Sebassis. The two begin their struggle.\n\nGunn, Spike, and Illyria kill their targets; Lindsey and Lorne wipe out the Sahvrin clan. Then, on Angel's order, Lorne executes Lindsey, drops his gun, and leaves, declaring his debt paid. Wesley is killed as he knocks out Cyrus Vail; as he dies, Illyria comforts him in Fred's guise, then kills Vail when Vail regains consciousness.\n\nAngel is losing his fight with Hamilton, until Connor arrives to join the fight. Hamilton proudly announces that the power of the Senior Partners courses through his veins, prompting Angel to assume vampiric form and drink his blood – acquiring enough of Hamilton's strength to defeat him. Expecting a swift counterattack from the Senior Partners, Angel directs Connor to leave; Angel then heads to rendezvous with his surviving allies, minus Lorne.\n\nAn army of supernatural creatures descends on Angel, Spike, a wounded Gunn, and Illyria. As the episode (and series) ends, Angel declares, \"Let's go to work,\" as we hear swords clash.\n\nIn the scene in which Mercedes McNab is in bed with Adam Baldwin's character, plastic inserts in her bra are clearly visible as she turns to the side. Jeffrey Bell jokes in the DVD commentary that she is \"not a special effect,\" that she is quite real, despite the digitally added fake blood on her lip.\n\nJoss Whedon says of this episode, \"This was not the final grace note after a symphony, the way the \"Buffy\" finale was. We are definitely still in the thick of it. But the point of the show is that you're never done; no matter who goes down, the fight goes on.\" Whedon says that \"Angel\" is about redemption, \"something you fight for every day, so I wanted him to go out fighting. People kept calling it a cliffhanger. I was like, 'Are you mad, sir? Don't you see that that is the final statement?'\"\n\nProducer David Fury agrees, saying it was \"the perfect way to end the series, and anybody who says otherwise is dumb.\" The central theme of \"Angel\", Fury explains, is that \"the fight never ends...You can't ever win but the fight is worth fighting. Any proper resolution of, 'Oh, we've defeated the demons, they've gone back to hell, let's get a beer,' just would have been absolutely wrong for that show.\" Part of Angel's story, Fury says, is that \"everybody that he's ever been close to dies...he will always outlive the people he cares about.\"\n\nChristian Kane could not be on set for the final episode, so all the Lindsey scenes in this episode were written and shot about a month in advance. Kane says that he was unhappy with the way his character ended the season, but mostly because the series ending came as a shock and \"we’ve all just now gotten comfortable in our skin.\"\n\nAlexis Denisof, whose character was also killed in this episode, says that he \"couldn't think of anything more fitting...the perfect human death of a human life.\" Joss Whedon says he wouldn't have killed Wesley if the series hadn't been canceled, but that scene ended up being \"one of my favorite moments that we shot... If you're going to go out, go out hard.\"\n\nJoss Whedon quashed the rumors that Sarah Michelle Gellar would appear as Buffy in an interview with \"TV Guide\", saying he did not want the finale to \"revolve around a guest star.\" He added that \"I want to end the show with the people who've been in the trenches together, the characters who have lived - and occasionally died - together.\" Writer Jeffrey Bell elaborates, saying Gellar was intended to appear in the penultimate episode of \"Angel\" but couldn't make it due to other commitments. By the time the producers learned she was available for the finale, Bell says, \"to force her into the very last episode to reread stuff that we already dealt with didn't make any sense.\"\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of its initial airing, the episode garnered mixed reactions from both critics and fans. It appeared on Zap2it's list of the worst series finales because \"we never saw the end of the fight.\" E! News quoted another fan as saying, \"Well, that was the best first half of a season finale ever...what happened to part two?\" A different criticism came from essayist Roz Kaveney, who argued that this episode was a classic example of \"'Superhero Exceptionalism', the idea that superheroes are exempt from normal considerations and entitled to ignore consequences.\" The characters' attempt at redemption via a \"single gratuitous heroic act of defiance\", Kaveney felt, was contrary to \"Angel\"'s message that redemption was only earned \"one day at a time, by slow increments\". \n\nOver time however, \"Not Fade Away\" has come to receive critical acclaim, and is now sometimes referred to as one of the best series finales of all time. The Futon Critic named it the 4th best television episode of 2004, saying, \"The series finale was filled with tons of great \"holy shit\" moments - Illyria's reaction to Wesley's death alone should be required watching for everyone - but the closing moments cut right to the heart of what the show has always been about: the good fight (and the quest for redemption itself) is always a constant struggle.\" A \"Huffington Post\" article about series finales cites it as \"one of the few dramas that ended in a way that felt emotionally, tonally and thematically appropriate.\" In IGN's full series review, they say it \"stands as one of the best final episodes of any show ever\", and an article on Indiewire also placed it on their list of the best series finales. The episode was also nominated for a 2005 Hugo Award in the category of \"Best Dramatic Presentation: Short Form\". Matt Roush of \"TV Guide\" praised the series finale, finding it \"incredibly inspiring\" that Angel continues to seek redemption despite signing away the reward promised by the Shanshu Prophecy. \"The series retired with dignity, integrity — and, yes, soul\", Roush writes.\n\nCreator Joss Whedon says \"“That ain’t a cliff. I understand why people would want closure, but for me, that would be like adding a cliff note to the end. What I always wanted to say is, trying to become worthy of the life that you have is a life’s work. The fight is for always.\nActor Boreanaz says he is \"comfortable with the way they're ending it. It's very open-ended [and] goes out fighting.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1810870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810870", "title": "Reconciliation ecology", "text": "Reconciliation ecology\n\nReconciliation ecology is the branch of ecology which studies ways to encourage biodiversity in human-dominated ecosystems. Michael Rosenzweig first articulated the concept in his book \"Win-Win Ecology\", based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated nature preserves. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a \"win-win\" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.\n\nTraditional conservation is based on \"reservation and restoration\"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.\n\nWhile it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%. This includes agricultural land, pastureland, urban areas, and heavily harvested forest systems. An estimated 50% of arable land is already under cultivation. Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and is likely to continue to increase. Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global biogeochemical cycles, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas. These include addition of nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorus, acid rain, ocean acidification, redistribution of water resources, and increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and speciation events caused by formation of land bridges and colliding of continents.\n\nThe need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the species-area curve which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.\n\nThere are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species. The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of island biogeography as described by MacArthur and Wilson. Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.\n\nThe species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by Frank W. Preston. The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see SLOSS debate). The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55, meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.\n\nTaken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.\n\nHow can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature. Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. Rosenzweig cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. Additionally, the cirl bunting (\"Emberiza cirlus\") thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, natterjack toads (\"Bufo calamatus\") declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (\"Pinus palustris\") declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.\n\nThe emerging concept of ecosystem services (coined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called \"ordinary species\" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species. Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.\n\nReconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders. However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.\n\nIncreasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases \"in situ\" biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches. This may be especially important in agricultural systems where buffers, live fences, and other small habitat areas can serve as stops between major preserves. This concept forms the basis of the subdiscipline countryside biogeography which studies the potential of the matrix between preserves to provide habitat for species moving from preserve to preserve.\n\nPlacing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas, which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in outdoor education programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning. Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by invasive species. Reconnecting people with nature is especially important for conservation because there is a tendency for people to use the biodiversity present in the landscape they grew up in as a point of comparison for future trends (see Shifting baseline).\n\nThe results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. E. O. Wilson has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see Biophilia), and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.\n\nMany examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.\n\nWhile Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the Czech Republic, a system of human-engineered aquaculture ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of storks, which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in. There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient Mesopotamia, with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in China.\n\nAgroforestry provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as coffee or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas. For example, shade-grown coffee plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods. Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products. The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving fallowlands alongside farmed areas can enhance understory plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.\n\nThe oil palm (\"Elaeis guineensis\") provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology. It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops, so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native biodiversity, perhaps even more so than logging. However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry. As a monoculture, oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests. Many companies are attempting an integrated pest management approach which encourages the planting of species that support predators and parasitoids of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community. Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits. Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to insectivorous birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities. Additionally, steps such as maintaining riparian buffer zones or natural forest patches can help to slow the loss of biodiversity within oil palm plantation landscapes. By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and ecosystem services.\n\nThere are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in Arizona who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened leopard frogs (\"Rana chiricahuensis\"), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle, and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable California tiger salamander (\"Ambystoma californiense\") in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining vernal pools would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions. In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland. Another example from Rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes (\"Lanius ludovicianus\") to populate pastureland by placing perches around the pasture. These are all simple, low-cost ways to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting the human uses of the landscape.\n\nUrban ecology can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use. Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the urban heat island effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity. There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species. However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.\n\nBecause cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the flood control and water supply services. Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured lawns, as is seen in the National Wildlife Federation’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program. Peregrine falcons (\"Falco peregrinus\"), which were once endangered by pesticide use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced rock dove. The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.\n\nIn Florida, the Florida manatee (\"Trichechus manatus latirostris\") uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico drops. These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. American crocodiles (\"Crocodylus acutus\") have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the Turkey Point power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.\n\nWastewater treatment systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the Everglades in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered wood stork (\"Mycteria americana\"). Stormwater treatment ponds can provide important breeding habitat for amphibians, especially where natural wetlands have been drained by human development.\n\nCoral reefs have been intensively impacted by human use, including overfishing and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building artificial reefs that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away. Even structures as simple as scrap metal and automobiles can be used as habitat, providing added benefits of freeing space in landfills.\n\nGovernmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' Endangered Species Act requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place. To help mediate this problem, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date. This practice has already led to an increase in aplomado falcons (\"Falco femoralis\") in Texas and red-cockaded woodpeckers (\"Picoides borealis\") in the Southeastern US.\n\nAnother example is the US Department of Agriculture’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity. In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, erosion controlling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible carbon sequestration.\n\nWhile reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as \"untidy\" and a sign of poor management by residents. Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values. Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially predators such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.\nEven with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of waterfowl, show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance. No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans. These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.\n\nThere is hence a double social challenge for reconciliation ecology : making people's perception of biodiversity evolve, and then changing relating norms and policies so as to better consider biodiversity as a positive component in our habitat.\n\n\n"}

The winner of the play-offs of the Pro A is crowned the French national champion.\n\nAll 16 Pro A League teams play each other twice during the regular season. At the end of the regular season, the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs.

He received his Ph.D in Zoology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1966 and has gone on to hold a number of positions around the United States.\n\nRosenzweig has a large body of editorial work spanning from 1977 to present, founding the journals Evolutionary Ecology and Evolutionary Ecology Research as well as the publishing house, Evolutionary Ecology Ltd. with the help of his wife Carole. He has always been committed to the responsibility of disseminating scientific knowledge. An example of his commitment is when the Journal of Evolutionary Ecology was bought out at and the prices were to be raised he stepped down from his Editor in Chief position and founded Evolutionary Ecology Ltd which published the journal Evolutionary Ecology Research. He and his wife continue to operate with the responsibility of disseminating knowledge at the forefront of their business.\n\nDr. Rosenzweig also has an impressive number of publications that reach up into the hundreds [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. His articles cover topics ranging from species diversity to predation dynamics and includes work on environmental issues and public policy. He has published three books on the origins and conservation of species diversity, both for technical and general audiences.

He is the author of the \"Rivers of London\" series of novels. He also wrote two \"Doctor Who\" serials in the late 1980s and spin-off novels from \"Doctor Who\" and \"Blake's 7\".\n\nBorn in Camden, Aaronovitch is the son of the economist Sam Aaronovitch who was a senior member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and the younger brother of actor Owen Aaronovitch and journalist David Aaronovitch. He attended Holloway School.\n\nAaronovitch wrote two \"Doctor Who\" serials, \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (1988) and \"Battlefield\" (1989), for BBC television, and also the novelization of the former.\n\nHe wrote one episode for \"Casualty\" (1990) and was then a regular writer on science fiction series \"Jupiter Moon\".\n\nHe subsequently wrote or co-wrote three \"Doctor Who\" spin-off novels in the Virgin Publishing \"New Adventures\" range; he created the character Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart who became a semi-regular in the \"New Adventures\". He has also written a novel and several short stories published by Big Finish Productions featuring the character of Bernice Summerfield, who was originally developed in the \"New Adventures\". He also co-wrote a \"Doctor Who\" audio drama for Big Finish, and has written a number of \"Blake's 7\" spin-off audio dramas.\n\nAaronovitch lives in Wimbledon and is working on Rivers of London, a series of urban fantasy police procedural novels featuring Peter Grant, a Police Constable and apprentice wizard.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnight Fall\n\nIn May 1987, Aaronovitch submitted “Knight Fall” to the \"Doctor Who\" production office for Season 25. The story concerned about privatization. Script editor Andrew Cartmel liked the story ideas, but felt that the story was considered inappropriate, and has too many supporting characters. Aaronovitch would write \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" as the story opener Season 25. \n\nTransit\n\nAfter failing to feature Aaronovitch’s “\"Knight Fall\"” storyline to production, Aaronovitch submitted a story on June 1987, entitled as “\"Transit\"”. The story would see the Doctor and Ace in the future, land in a metro station, and discover transportation portals that could lead any body throughout the Solar System, but one of the portals leads a gate way to hell. Even though it is unexplainable to how Aaronovitch’s scripts of “\"Transit\"” never came to fruition, he would adapt the story as a book for \"Virgin New Adventures\" series in December 1992. \n\nEarth Aid\n\nDuring Summer of 1988, Aaronovitch submitted a three-part adventure story for \"Doctor Who’s\" 27th Season (which never came to fruition), and was called ”Earth Aid”. The story would feature The Doctor seeing Ace as a captain of a hospital spaceship which is being under attack by the Metatraxi. The story, however, was abandoned when on September 1989, The BBC arguably would cancel \"Doctor Who\" after its 26 Season, due to lower ratings, and hatred from audiences. In July 2011, Big Finish Productions released an audio adaptation of Earth Aid, by Aaronovitch and Cartmel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In English, French, and so on, it has developed varying meanings.\n\nThe term was used to refer to the prison for hostages in Constantinople, which was near the bath-house, and thereafter all the slave quarters in the Ottoman Empire and the Barbary regencies. The hostages of the Barbary pirates slept in the prisons at night, leaving during the day to work as laborers, galley slaves, or domestic servants. The communication between master and slave and between slaves of different origins was made in a \"lingua franca\" known as \"Sabir\" or Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a Mediterranean pidgin language with Romance and Arabic vocabulary. \n\nThe Slaves' Prison in Valletta, Malta, which was both a prison and a place where Muslim slaves slept at night, was known as the \"bagnio\" or \"bagno\".\n\n\"Bagnio\" was a term for a bath or bath-house. In England, it was originally used to name coffeehouses that offered Turkish baths, but by 1740 it signified a boarding house where rooms could be hired with no questions asked, or a brothel.\n\n\"Bagne\" became the word for the prisons of the galley slaves in the French Navy; after galley service was abolished, the word continued to be used as a generic term for any hard labour prison. The last one in European France, the \"Bagne de Toulon\", was closed in 1873. \n\nThe penal colony on Devil's Island in French Guiana, which was not shut down until 1953, was also called a \"bagne\", and features in the famous bestseller \"Papillon\".\n\n\"El trato de Argel\" (\"Life in Algiers\", 1580), \"Los baños de Argel\" (\"The Bagnios of Algiers\", 1615), \"El gallardo español\" (\"The Gallard Spaniard\", 1615) and \"La gran sultana\" (\"The Great Sultana\", 1615) were four comedies by Miguel de Cervantes about the life of the galley slaves, called \"caitiffs\". Cervantes himself had been imprisoned in Algiers (1575–1580). His novel \"Don Quixote\" also features a subplot with the story of a caitiff (chapters 39-41 of the first part). \n\nA bagnio, in reference to a brothel or boarding house, is mentioned in \"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\" (1824) by James Hogg as the location of a quarrel between two young Edinburgh nobleman that precedes one of them being murdered and the other arrested for the crime.\n\nIn \"The Day of the Locust\" (1939) by Nathanael West, Claude Estee's wife, Alice, says \"Nothing like a good \"bagnio\" to set a fellow up.\" \n\nFrequent mention of a bagnio is made in \"A Maggot\" (1985) by John Fowles, set in 1736 and mainly written in the English of that time. In Fowles' novel, the term denotes a brothel, specifically the one run by 'Mistress Claiborne'.\n\n"}

After an excellent first year of professional play, Seo underwent reconstructive surgery on his elbow in . He did not pitch again until . On July 21, , Seo made his major league debut with a scoreless inning of relief against the Cincinnati Reds. In , Seo spent the entire season with the Mets as a starting pitcher. He logged 188 innings pitched and 31 games started, both tops among rookie pitchers in the National League that year. In , Seo struggled, splitting his time between the Mets and the Triple-A Norfolk Tides.\n\nWhen he first pitched in the major leagues, he had two pitches – a fastball which topped out at 91–92 miles per hour (he threw in the mid-90s before Tommy John surgery), and a deceptive changeup in the mid 80s. Not being able to throw as hard as earlier in his career meant it was important for Seo to maintain a high degree of control over his pitches which, on occasion he was unable to do. This, along with Seo's reluctance to change his pitching mechanics, led to confrontations with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson.\n\nIn , Seo seemed to have taken heed of this advice, developing a slider, splitter, and curveball. The Mets' surplus of pitchers resulted in his spending much of the year at Norfolk. However, he was called up to the majors in early August 2005, and pitched extremely well.\n\nOn January 4, , Seo was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Tim Hamulack in exchange for relievers Duaner Sánchez and Steve Schmoll. On June 26, he was traded by the Dodgers, along with catcher Dioner Navarro and outfielder Justin Ruggiano to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for pitcher Mark Hendrickson and catcher Toby Hall. Seo made his debut with the Rays on June 28, 2006, against the Florida Marlins, pitching two scoreless innings.\n\nIn , despite his strong performance during spring training, he recorded a 3–4 record with an 8.13 ERA.

He pitched extremely well, having tied with the second lowest ERA in the tournament with the Dominican Republic's Bartolo Colón, with a 0.64 ERA. In the semi final game against Japan, in 6 innings Seo did not allow a single run. Even though Japan eventually won the game, Seo's start was still considered as one of the best pitching performances in the WBC.\n\n"}

(or simply André & Wally B.) is a 1984 American animated short film produced by The Graphics Group, then a division of Lucasfilm which was later renamed Pixar before being spun off as a separate company in 1986.\n\nThe animation in the film was by John Lasseter – his first computer animated project with Lucasfilm – and as a result of the success of this project and others would become an important executive at Pixar. The animation was groundbreaking by the standards of the time and helped spark the film industry's interest in computer animation. The film was released on July 25, 1984, at SIGGRAPH in Minneapolis.\n\nThe short involves a boy named André awakening in a forest and being confronted by a pesky bee named Wally B. André tricks the bee into turning his back so that he can run away. Angered, Wally B. chases André and eventually catches up with him, and strikes with the stinger. A collision occurs off-screen and a dizzy Wally B. reappears with a bent stinger. Shortly, Wally B. gets hit by André's tossed hat as a last laugh.\n\nThe credits for the piece are concept/direction Alvy Ray Smith, animation John Lasseter, technical lead Bill Reeves, technical contributions by Tom Duff (who designed the animation program called “md”, short for \"motion doctor\"), Eben Ostby, Rob Cook, Loren Carpenter, Ed Catmull, David Salesin, Tom Porter, and Sam Leffler, filming by David DiFrancesco, Tom Noggle, and Don Conway, and computer logistics by Craig Good.\n\nThe title is a tribute to the 1981 film \"My Dinner with Andre\", starring Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, the latter of which went on to voice Rex for the \"Toy Story\" franchise. It was originally entitled \"My Breakfast with André\", about waking up with an android.\n\nThe animation on this short was truly groundbreaking at the time, featuring the first use of motion blur in CG animation and complex 3D backgrounds, where the lighting styles and colors were inspired by Maxfield Parrish, made using particle systems. Lasseter pushed the envelope by asking for manipulatable shapes capable of the squash and stretch style, as earlier CG models had generally been restricted to rigid geometric shapes. It was rendered on a Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer and ten VAX-11/750 superminicomputers from Project Athena. The film's soundtrack was partially produced by SoundDroid.\n\nThe film premiered on July 25, 1984, in Minneapolis at the annual SIGGRAPH conference, though 2 shots or about 6 seconds of the film were incomplete and made of pencil test line drawings over the completed backgrounds. The final rendering of the film was released a month later, on August 17 at Toronto's International Animation Festival. The film was also showcased at \"Digicon '85\".\n\nIt was released for home video in the collections \"State of the Art of Computer Animation\", \"Tiny Toy Stories\", and \"Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1\" (DVD/Blu-ray).\n\n\n"}

These particles can be drawn to the drawing surface by a magnet-tipped stylus or optionally-provided shapes, or removed to the hidden back side by a sliding eraser bar. The middle layer is divided into a honeycomb of cells, keeping the liquid static and the particles evenly distributed across the panel. The liquid is formulated so that the floating particles can be pulled through it in response to the magnetic forces, but not due to gravity.\n\nThe toy was originally produced as \"Magna Doodle\" by Tyco until 1997, when Tyco was purchased by Mattel. Mattel then sold the toy under its Fisher-Price brand. The brand was later sold to the Ohio Art Company. Today, the \"Magna Doodle\" brand is owned by Cra-Z-Art. Fisher-Price have produced their own alternative called the Doodle Pro, while Ohio Art produced the similar Doodle Sketch until 2016 when it sold the brand to Spin Master.

The aerospike creates a detached shock ahead of the body. Between the shock and the forebody a zone of recirculating flow occurs which acts like a more streamlined forebody profile, reducing the drag.\n\nThis concept was used on the UGM-96 Trident I and is estimated to have increased the range by 550 km. The Trident aerospike consists of a flat circular plate mounted on an extensible boom which is deployed shortly after the missile breaks through the surface of the water after launch from the submarine. The use of the aerospike allowed a much blunter nose shape, providing increased internal volume for payload and propulsion without increasing the drag. This was required because the Trident I C-4 was fitted with a third propulsion stage to achieve the desired increase in range over the Poseidon C-3 missile it replaced. To fit within the existing submarine launch tubes the third-stage motor had to be mounted in the center of the post-boost vehicle with the reentry vehicles arranged around the motor.\n\nAt the same time (middle 1970s) aerospike was developed in KB Mashinostroyeniya (KBM) for 9M39 surface-to-air missile of 9K38 Igla MANPADS (in order to diminish heating of infrared homing seeker fairing and reduce wave drag), giving the name to the whole system ( means 'needle'). Simplified Igla-1 version with a different kind of target seeker featured a tripod instead of 'needle' for the same purpose.\n\nFurther development of this concept has resulted in the \"air-spike\". This is formed by concentrated energy, either from an electric arc torch or a pulsed laser, projected forwards from the body, which produces a region of low density hot air ahead of the body. This has the advantage over a structural aerospike that the air density is lower than that behind a shock wave providing increased drag reduction.\n\nIn 1995 at the 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting it was reported that tests were performed with an aerospike-protected missile dome to Mach 6, obtaining quantitative surface pressure and temperature-rise data on the feasibility of using aerospikes on hypersonic missiles.\n\n"}

{"id": "1810915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810915", "title": "Organ repertoire", "text": "Organ repertoire\n\nThe organ repertoire is considered to be the largest and oldest repertory of all musical instruments. Because of the organ's (or pipe organ's) prominence in worship in Western Europe from the Middle Ages on, a significant portion of organ repertoire is sacred in nature. The organ's suitability for improvisation by a single performer is well adapted to this liturgical role and has allowed many blind organists to achieve fame; it also accounts for the relatively late emergence of written compositions for the instrument in the Renaissance. Although instruments are still disallowed in most Eastern churches, organs have found their way into a few synagogues as well as secular venues where organ recitals take place.\n\nThe earliest surviving keyboard compositions (keyboard music was not instrument-specific until the sixteenth century) are from England (Robertsbridge Codex c. 1365) and Italy (Faenza Codex, 15th century). The organ is specified in Marco Antonio Cavazzoni's \"Recerchari, motetti, canzoni [...] libro primo\", printed in Venice in 1523.\n\nThe English virginal style was a manner of composition and performance prevalent in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries; some manuscripts are preserved in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. Sweelinck was strongly influenced by this style. Organ music was almost exclusively based on learned contrapuntal, exemplified by the Fantasia (\"Fancy\"), as well as works based on contrapuntal treatment of chant. Composers well known for their choral works wrote organ music, for example Tallis, Byrd and Gibbons.\n\nIn France, baroque organ music (referred to as French classical music, despite being from the Baroque period) was almost exclusively liturgical in nature and composed and performed in a very systemized manner. In addition, the organs were built along standardized lines. The compositions were smaller scale compared with those in other countries. Some of the forms (the Plein jeu, the Récit de Cromorne, and the Tierce en Taille, for example) utilized almost no counterpoint, while others (the Duo, the Trio, and the Fugue) were contrapuntal in nature (though the counterpoint was not generally as complex as in Germany).\n\nHandel contributed significantly to the organ repertoire through his numerous organ concertos.\n\nIn Germany and Austria, baroque organ music utilized increasing amounts of counterpoint. Organ music in the baroque can be divided into works based on Lutheran chorales (e.g. chorale preludes and chorale fantasias) and those not (e.g. toccatas, fantasias and free preludes). There are marked stylistic differences between the composers of North, South and Central Germany such that further generalisation is inaccurate. The North German Praeludium (an important form consisting of alternating sections of free material written in the largely misunderstood \"stylus phantasticus\" and fugal material) reached its zenith in Dieterich Buxtehude, informed by Matthias Weckmann and Heinrich Scheidemann (influenced most strongly by Jan Peeterszoon Sweelinck and by the Italian school transported to North Germany by Heinrich Schütz and Samuel Scheidt). Georg Böhm remained firmly representative of the South German School, though Johann Pachelbel's influence as a teacher extended across North, South and Central Germany. Baroque organ music arguably reached its height in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Many of Bach's earlier free works are heavily influenced by Buxtehude's style, but much more importantly, Bach developed a style essentially separate from the predominant styles of North, South and Central Germany. The majority of his free works consisted of two parts: a prelude, toccata or fantasia, and a fugue. Bach also wrote a large number of chorale preludes.\n\nThe great composers of the classical era wrote sparingly if at all for the organ: Haydn wrote for clockwork organs, and wrote several concerti for organ and orchestra. Beethoven and Mozart wrote only a handful of works. Brixli and Wagenseil also wrote organ concerti. All works are restricted to a single manual.\n\nEnglish composers John Stanley and William Boyce wrote a number of important works at this time but should be considered composers of the baroque, not classical era.\n\nDuring the Romantic era, technological advances allowed new features to be added to the organ, increasing its potential for expression. The work of the French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in particular represented a great leap in organ building. Cavaillé-Coll refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters. He invented an ingenious pneumatic combination action system for his five-manual organ at Saint-Sulpice. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing (final regulation of the pitch and tone) techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe, and the flute. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils, allowing for the use of higher wind pressures. For a mechanical tracker action to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance provided by the Barker lever was required, which Cavaillé-Coll included in his larger instruments. This pneumatic assist made it possible to couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. All these innovations allowed the organist to execute a seamless crescendo from \"pianissimo\" all the way to \"fortissimo\": something that had never before been possible by the organ. Composers were now able to write music for the organ which mirrored that played by the symphony orchestra. For this reason, both the organs and the literature of this time period are considered \"symphonic\".\n\nCésar Franck, Charles-Marie Widor, and Félix-Alexandre Guilmant were important organist-composers who were inspired by the sounds made possible through Cavaillé-Coll's advances in organ building. They wrote extensively for the organ, and their works have endured. A particularly important form of organ composition in the Romantic era was the organ symphony, first seen in César Franck's \"Grand pièce symphonique\" and refined in the ten symphonies of Widor and the six of Louis Vierne. The organ symphony, comprising several movements, paralleled symphonies written for the orchestra. Guilmant wrote several compositions similar to organ symphonies; however, preferring to remain in the classical mold, he called them sonatas. In addition to organ symphonies, composers of the day wrote in other forms: Franck wrote eleven other major organ works, including the \"Prélude, Fugue et Variation\" and the \"Trois Chorals\"; Widor wrote a \"Suite Latine\" on various plainsong tunes; Vierne composed \"24 pièces de fantaisie\", of which the \"Carillon de Westminster\" is perhaps the best-known. The influence of these composers has persisted through generations of composers for the organ through history, all the way to the modern-day composers like Olivier Messiaen and Naji Hakim, and modern-day improvisers like Pierre Cochereau and Pierre Pincemaille.\n\nIn Germany, a revival of interest in organ music began with Felix Mendelssohn who wrote six Sonatas, three Preludes and Fugues, and several smaller works for the organ. Josef Rheinberger wrote 20 sonatas for the organ and numerous smaller works, all of which blend the romantic style with the contrapuntal complexity of the old German masters. Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann did not leave any large-scale works for the organ, but both left behind some smaller works which have attracted considerable attention. During the mid-19th century, composers such as Franz Liszt and Julius Reubke wrote works for the organ of immense scale. Organs being built during this time were larger and had greater dynamic range than organs of the Baroque period, and Romantic composers were determined to exploit the capabilities of these instruments. One of Liszt's most famous organ works is his Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale Ad nos ad salutarem undam. The entire 30-minute work is based on a single theme by Giacomo Meyerbeer and it shows the influence of Liszt's Sonata in B minor for piano. Liszt's student, Reubke, wrote a programmatic Sonata in C minor based on selected verses from Psalm 94. The work, while original in its own right, is heavily influenced by the work of Liszt. These two works are the most monumental compositions for the organ from the mid-19th century.\n\nOrgan music in Germany at the end of the 19th century is dominated by the towering figure of Max Reger. Reger's works represent extreme Romanticism; extremely dense harmonies, sudden dynamic contrasts, and extensive forms are all present in Reger's organ works.\n\nIn the 20th-century, German organ music was strongly influenced by the neo-Baroque movement. A revival of interest in Baroque forms and performance practices led to a rejection of the complexity and Romanticism of Liszt and Reger. Important composers of this period are Hugo Distler and Paul Hindemith. Hindemith is widely known for his three organ sonatas. Distler's organ music is not as well-known, and Distler is remembered primarily as a choral composer. His most popular work is the Partita on \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\", a work which treats the old Lutheran chorale in a clearly modern idiom.\n\nIn the United States, Dudley Buck was a prominent composer, although his work has remained largely unknown outside of the U.S.\n\nDuring this time, transcriptions of other music (usually orchestral music or piano solos) for organ became popular. Often the transcriptions would utilize only an excerpt of the original piece. The most famous transcriber for the organ is Edwin Lemare. He transcribed hundreds of works for the organ, the most memorable being his transcriptions of Wagner works.\n\nDuring the 20th century, there were a number of independent trends in organ repertoire:\n\n\n"}

The small church is prominently located at the intersection of Bloor Street and Avenue Road, near the University of Toronto. It was founded in 1871 when the area was still on the fringe of the city. The Gothic Revival style building opened on June 15, 1879.\n\nAs with many other downtown churches the Church of the Redeemer suffered from falling attendance in the late twentieth century. The church ran into severe financial difficulties and in 1979 the parish voluntarily disestablished itself and was taken over by the Anglican Diocese of Toronto. The church lands were sold to developers and the massive Four Seasons Renaissance Centre was built on them. With the money from this deal the church was again solvent and regained its independence. The money also paid for much needed renovations. In 2000 the church launched a major renovation project as extra meeting space and offices were constructed under the building.\n\nThe church is known for its progressive stance on social issues, especially gay rights. In 1998 the congregation published \"An Honourable Estate: Same Sex Unions and the Church\" advocating the blessing of same-sex unions. Integrity Toronto worships in the church. The parish uses exclusively the Book of Alternative Services.\n\nThe church is noted by passersby for its prominent sign, often featuring a quotation or thought for meditation. The church is also known to host a range of musical events and concerts. For example, Canadian group Great Lake Swimmers played two shows at the Church of the Redeemer on April 14, 2007.\n\n\n"}

It was written by Thania St. John and Jane Espenson, directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and first broadcast on January 12, 1999.\n\nWhile waiting in the park for Buffy, her mother Joyce discovers the bodies of two dead children. At school the next day, Buffy shows Giles a symbol which was visible on the hands of the two children. He tells her that demons do not use symbols, and that it is no doubt occult-related. This angers Buffy, as Slayers are forbidden to harm humans, even dark witches.\n\nAt lunch, Buffy tells the Scooby Gang about the murders. Joyce shows up and announces that there will be a vigil at City Hall that night. Many concerned parents attend the vigil, including Willow's mother. Mayor Wilkins says a few words before Joyce gives a speech about how the people of Sunnydale must take back their city from the monsters, witches, and slayers.\n\nLater, Michael, Amy, and Willow perform a spell in a circle that surrounds the symbol Buffy saw on the children's hands. Buffy finds the symbol in one of Willow's notebooks. Willow explains that the symbol is part of a protection spell for Buffy's upcoming birthday.\n\nMeanwhile, all the school lockers are searched for witch-related material, and Giles's occult books are seized by police. Amy and Willow are taken to Principal Snyder's office for questioning.\n\nAt Buffy's home, Joyce forbids Buffy to see Willow anymore, takes credit for the locker searches and states that Buffy's slaying does Sunnydale no good. The ghosts of two children appear to Joyce and tell that she has to hurt the \"bad girls\".\n\nAt the park, Buffy talks with Angel, who convinces her not to give up fighting. When he makes a passing remark about the children and their parents, Buffy is struck by the thought that the children's parents were never seen or mentioned, and the fact that no one knows the children's names. After using the Internet to contact Willow, the Scooby Gang learns that every fifty years throughout history, the murdered bodies of two nameless children have been found, resulting in peaceful communities being torn apart by vigilante chaos. The earliest record dating from Germany during 1649, where a cleric from the Black Forest discovered the corpses of \"Hans and Greta Strauss\", inspiring the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. Giles explains that certain demons thrive on watching humans destroy each other through persecution and ignorance. According to Giles, this is what set off the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nBuffy and Giles are knocked out with chloroform by Joyce and her friends, at the behest of the two children. Amy, Willow, and Buffy are taken to City Hall where they are tied to wooden posts surrounded by books. Cordelia finds Giles unconscious, wakes him and they rush to City Hall. Just as Buffy wakes up, her mother lights books on fire, sentencing the three girls to death by burning at the stake. Amy escapes by transforming herself into a rat.\n\nAt City Hall, Cordelia uses a fire hose to put the burning stakes out. The two children transform into a large demon which charges at Buffy. She breaks her stake and uses it to impale the demon.\n\nBuffy and Willow are playing with Amy the rat and find a way to bring her back. Buffy and Willow's mother forgot about what happened. But Willow's mom remembers Willow said she is dating Oz, he has come to dinner.\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" praised \"Gingerbread\" for its humorous dialogue and the way it progressed the story arc, but criticized the action as slow and repetitive. A reviewer for the BBC said the episode was well paced and atmospheric, particularly Willow being accused of witchcraft, the restrictions on personal liberty, vigilantism, and book burning.\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 45,932, in an area of 416.68 km².\nThe municipality of Ourém contains two cities: Ourém (about 12,000 residents) and Fátima (about 11,000 inhabitants).\n\nThe municipality is bordered by the municipalities of Pombal (to the north), Alvaiázere (to the northeast), Ferreira do Zêzere and Tomar (to the east), Torres Novas (to the southeast), Alcanena (to the southwest), and Batalha and Leiria (to the west). The main historical attraction of the municipality is the mighty Castle of Ourém. Nevertheless, millions of faithful Catholics come to the parish of Fátima every year to visit Cova da Iria, the site where three child shepherds are said to have had visions of Our Lady of Fátima in 1917. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima has become one of the largest religious tourism sites in the world.\n\nThe present Mayor is Luís Miguel Albuquerque, elected by the Social Democratic Party.\n\nThe municipal holiday is June 20.\n\nA fortification existed in the region of Ourém since at least the period of Muslim domination. The area was reconquered by Christians in 1136, and the town was donated in 1178 by the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, to his third daughter, Princess Theresa. The princess granted it a letter of feudal rights (foral) in 1180, to promote the settlement and development of the village.\n\nUnder the Muslims, the village was apparently called \"Abdegas\", but during the times of the Reconquista (12th century) it was called \"Portus de Auren\", from which the name \"Ourém\" was later derived. According to popular myth, the name of the village is actually derived from a Moorish Princess who converted to Christianity under the name of \"Oureana\".\n\nThe town's historical nucleus developed around the Castle of Ourém, which during the Reconquista served as watchpost for the Castle of Leiria, an important stronghold located nearby. In the mid-14th century, King Peter I turned Ourém and its lands into a County. The third Count of Ourém was the celebrated Nuno Álvares Pereira, the knight who led the Portuguese army to victory against the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385.\n\nUnder Count Afonso (1402–1460), fourth Count of Ourém, the town flourished. To accommodate his court, Count Afonso remodelled the old-fashioned castle and built a palace inside it following the trends in 15th-century Italian military architecture. The ruins of the palace and castle are the main historical and touristic attraction of the town nowadays. Count Afonso is buried in the crypt of the main church of Ourém in a magnificent Gothic tomb created by one of Portugal's main sculptors of the time, Diogo Pires-o-Velho.\n\nAfter reaching its peak in the 15th century, the town entered a period of relative decline. The town and castle were greatly damaged by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and the Napoleonic Invasions.\n\nUntil its elevation to the status of a city on August 16, 1991, Ourém was known as Vila Nova de Ourém.\n\nThe legend of the name of the village and Oureana is retold by \"Friar Bernardino de Brito\" in his Chronicle of the Order of Cister (1602): In a surprise attack on the St John's Day in 1158, a Christian knight, \"Gonçalo Hermigues\" and his companions kidnapped a Moorish princess with the famous Arab name of Fatima. The knight took Fatima to a small village of the recently created Kingdom of Portugal, in the Serra de Aire hills. The princess fell in love with the Christian knight and decided to become herself a Christian, taking the name of Oureana. After their marriage, the princess received as prize the town which she called Ourém, derived from her own name.\n\nThe name of the parish of Fátima of Ourém is probably related to this legend.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n"}
{"id": "1810955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810955", "title": "4-2-4T", "text": "4-2-4T\n\nUnder the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and four trailing wheels on two axles. This type of locomotive is often called a Huntington type.\n\nThe configuration was most often used for tank engines, which is noted by adding letter suffixes to the configuration, such as for a conventional side-tank locomotive, for a saddle-tank locomotive, for a well-tank locomotive and for a rack-equipped tank locomotive.\nThis wheel arrangement was mainly used on various tank locomotive configurations. Eight 4-2-4 well- and back-tank locomotives which entered service on the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1853 appear to have been the first with this wheel arrangement. The engine was designed by James Pearson, the railway company's engineer, and featured single large flangeless driving wheels between two supporting four-wheeled bogies. The water was carried in both well- and back-tanks, leaving the boilers exposed in the same way as on most tender locomotives.\n\nThe first eight known 4-2-4 locomotives entered service on the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1853 and 1854, numbered in the range from 39 to 46. They had diameter flangeless driving wheels, supported by leading and trailing two-axle bogies. The water was carried in both well- and back-tanks. Two more engines were built in 1859 and 1862, but with much smaller diameter driving wheels.\nBetween 1869 and 1873, new locomotives were built to replace four of the original diameter driving wheeled engines, re-using the engine numbers of the locomotives being replaced. These four replacement engines had slightly smaller diameter driving wheels.\n\nIn 1881, this wheel arrangement was also used by the Great Western Railway on William Dean's experimental locomotive no. 9. Since it was so prone to derailing as to be unable to be moved from the workshops where it was built, it did no work and was rebuilt to a tender locomotive in 1884. Dugald Drummond of the London and South Western Railway built a 4-2-4T F9 class combined locomotive and inspection saloon in 1899. It was little used after Drummond's death in 1912.\n\nThe engine \"C.P. Huntington\" was one of three identical 4-2-4 tank locomotives. They were the first locomotives to be purchased by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1863, for use on light commuter services in the Sacramento area. The locomotives had serious shortcomings. The single driving axle did not carry the full weight of the engine's rear end due to the trailing truck and, in addition to being too light, it therefore lacked adhesion to reliably pull trains, especially on gradients. The short water tank on the Forney-type frame prevented the locomotives from travelling any moderate distance without consuming all of their water. As a result, these locomotives were only used when absolutely necessary.\n\nIn 1863, a sister engine, the \"T.D. Judah\", was built by the Cooke Locomotive Works for a railroad which was unable to pay for it and was purchased by the Central Pacific Railroad. This locomotive was rebuilt to a 4-2-2 wheel arrangement in 1872.\n\nIn 1923, the South African Railways (SAR) conducted trials with a prototype petrol-paraffin powered road-rail tractor and, in 1924, placed at least two Dutton steam rail tractors in service on the new narrow gauge line between Naboomspruit and Singlewood in Transvaal. One of the latter had a wheel arrangement.\nThe designer, Major Frank Dutton, SAR Signal Engineer and the Motor Transport Superintendent, argued that a rubber tyre in contact with a hard road would be better at transferring tractive power than a steel wheel on steel rail. At least two Dutton Rail Tractors were built, both steam-powered and both rebuilt by the Britannia Engineering Works of Johannesburg from Yorkshire steam tractors.\n\nThe second Dutton tractor, no. RR1155, was a rail-only vehicle. It had a bogie at either end with the single pair of driving wheels on a differential axle in the centre. It was arranged for forward and reverse movement at all speeds, but it could only be used on the rails. Since, on occasion, the vehicle had to be transported by road, its construction was such that it could be readily disassembled into more easily transportable units, to be moved on road wheels to a workshop or for transfer of any other kind. In service, the tractor was often equipped with a water tank tender loaded with additional bags of coal on its running boards.\n\nThe \"Little Blue Engine\" from the original 1906 book \"The Little Engine That Could\" was a Forney with this wheel arrangement.\n"}

In August 2018, the station was rebranded as Cornell AgriTech, but its official name remains unchanged.\n\nThe Station is the sixth oldest institution of its kind in the country.\n\nThe New York State Agricultural Experiment Station was established by an Act of the New York State Legislature on June 26, 1880. More than 100 locations were considered, but a 125-acre parcel in Geneva was eventually chosen. In 1882, the State purchased the land, an Italianate villa, and all outbuildings from Nehemiah and Louisa Denton for $25,000. The villa was converted into the Station headquarters, now known as Parrott Hall. The new institution became operative on March 1, 1882. It would become known colloquially as the Geneva Experiment Station.\n\nAn 1883 Report of the Board of Control of the NYSAES to the New York State Assembly stated that there were immediate and dire threats State agricultural output caused by insect pests, bovine diseases, drought, soil nutrient exhaustion, and outward labor migration, and that an organization dedicated to staving off these threats was needed.\n\nOriginally, farmers wanted the station to serve as a model farm. However, the first director, E. Lewis Sturtevant, immediately established the policy that the station was to conduct agricultural science research and to establish experimental plots, both of which would have little resemblance to commercial agriculture. Nevertheless, the primary mission of the Station has always been to serve those who produce and consume New York's agricultural products.\n\nIn its early days, Station scientists, who were few in number, concentrated their efforts on dairy, horticulture, and evaluation of varieties of vegetables and field crops. In 1887, the program was broadened to include work on beef cattle, swine, and evaluation of fruit varieties. During this period, the station also began playing its continuing active role in the state's agricultural law enforcement program. Still later, research activities were added in the fields of bacteriology, dairy science, fruit horticulture, chemistry, plant pathology, and insect and mite species.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, a fundamental philosophy was developed regarding activities of the station that is still, basically, in effect today. This philosophy stated that research done at the station should be conducted on principles underlying agricultural practices and, further, that agricultural research should be the full-time responsibility of the staff without it having to also play a teaching role. This was a marked departure from the role played by staff at other agricultural experiment stations throughout the country.\n\nOriginally an independent unit of the state, the Station became part of Cornell University in 1923. Research was expanded to include studies on canning crops, nursery plants, and disease and insect pests of rubes. At the end of World War II, all animal research was moved to the Ithaca campus of Cornell University and the Geneva Station became a true horticultural research institute. Since then, it has been the center for research in New York on the production, protection, and utilization of fruit and vegetable crops, an industry that is today valued in excess of $2 billion.\n\nThe station has expanded from the original 125 acres, mansion and outbuildings to an 850-acre complex containing more than 20 major buildings. There are 700 acres are devoted to test plots, orchards, and vineyards, and 65,000 square feet of greenhouse space. New York State funded a $6.7 million construction project to renovate the Food Science Laboratory in 2007, with work completed by 2009.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Plant Genetic Resources Unit, which collects and does research on seeds for food plants, is also located on the Geneva campus.\n\nThe station has two outlying substations: the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland, and the Cornell Lake Erie Research & Extension Laboratory in Portland.\n\nAlthough an experiment station with a strong emphasis on applied research, the station also maintains a balance of basic research to serve as a foundation for future research applicable to New York agriculture. As of 2006, there were 350 employees working on approximately 230 different projects. Of those employees, 56 were professors.\n\nShortly after Station opened, Emmet S. Goff (1853–1902) became its first horticulturalist. His work on apple varieties, begun in 1883, produced a collection of research on apples and crabapples that was, at the time, the \"most noteworthy collection of its kind\", containing over 700 named varieties of apples and crabapples. Apple breeding efforts at the Station have led to the development of the Cortland, Empire, Jonagold, Jonamac and Macoun apples.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1925, the Station published a series of seven monographs on hardy fruits that were well adapted to northern climes as part of their annual report. The publications began with the two-volume \"Apples of New York\", a 1905 report written by Station horticulturalist Spencer Ambrose Beach. The series was continued by Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick, who released six volumes on grapes, plums, cherries, peaches, pears and small fruits over a period of eighteen years. The Station's series on the fruits of New York was, and remains today, a highly respected publication. A circular released July 1932 to commemorate Station's fiftieth year noted the \"exhaustive monographs on the hardy fruits\" and stated that the texts were, by that time, \"accepted universally as standard treatises on the subject.\" The Fruits of New York series was the highlight of a 2018 exhibition by the New York State Library.\n\nIn 2006, the Station developed three new wine grapes: 'Noiret', 'Corot noir' and 'Valvin Muscat' \n\nCornell's School of Integrative Plant Science contains the only horticulture program offered in any Ivy League school.\n\nPrior to the early 2000s, most of the money for agricultural research at the Station was provided by state and federal governments. The Station's 2007–2008 total budget was approximately $25.1 million; $11.8 million funded through the State University of New York base budget, $6.4 million from Cornell general purpose funds, $5.5 million in grants and contracts, and $1.1 million in Federal appropriations. As the station's research program has matured and expanded, the financial support base has been increasingly augmented by funds from foundations, industry, grower and food processor organizations, and by individuals.\n\n"}
{"id": "1810963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810963", "title": "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic", "text": "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\n\nThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (Czech and , ČSSR) was the name of Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 23 April 1990, when the country was under communist rule. Formally known as the Fourth Czechoslovak Republic, it has been regarded as a satellite state of the Soviet Union.\n\nFollowing the coup d'état of February 1948, when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power with the support of the Soviet Union, the country was declared a people's republic after the Ninth-of-May Constitution became effective. The traditional name \"Československá republika\" (\"Czechoslovak Republic\") was changed on 11 July 1960 following implementation of the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia as a symbol of the \"final victory of socialism\" in the country, and remained so until the Velvet Revolution in November 1989. Several other state symbols were changed in 1960. Shortly after the Velvet Revolution, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was renamed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic.\n\nThe official name of the country was the \"Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\". Conventional wisdom suggested that it would be known as simply the \"Czechoslovak Republic\"—its official name from 1920-1938 and from 1945-1960. However, Slovak politicians felt this diminished Slovakia's equal stature, and demanded that the country's name be spelled with a hyphen (i.e. \"Czecho-Slovak Republic\"), as it was spelled from Czechoslovak independence in 1918 until 1920, and again in 1938 and 1939. President Havel then changed his proposal to \"Republic of Czecho-Slovakia\"—a proposal that did not sit well with Czech politicians who saw reminders of the 1938 Munich Agreement, in which NaziGermany annexed a part of that territory. The name also means \"Land of the Czechs and Slovaks\" while Latinised from the country's original name\"the Czechoslovak Nation\"upon independence in 1918, from the Czech endonym \"Češi\"via its Polish orthography\n\nThe name \"Czech\" derives from the Czech endonym \"Češi\" via Polish, from the archaic Czech \"Čechové\", originally the name of the West Slavic tribe whose Přemyslid dynasty subdued its neighbors in Bohemia around AD 900. Its further etymology is disputed. The traditional etymology derives it from an eponymous leader Čech who led the tribe into Bohemia. Modern theories consider it an obscure derivative, e.g. from \"četa\", a medieval military unit. Meanwhile, the name \"Slovak\" was taken from the Slavic \"Slavs\" as the origin of the word \"\" itself remains uncertain.\n\nDuring the state's existence, it was simply referred to \"Czechoslovakia\" or sometimes the \"CSSR\" and \"CSR\" in short.\n\nBefore the Soviet liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, Edvard Beneš, the Czechoslovak leader, agreed to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's demands for unconditional agreement with Soviet foreign policy and the Beneš decrees. While Beneš was not a Moscow cadre and several domestic reforms of other Eastern Bloc countries were not part of Beneš' plan, Stalin did not object because the plan included property expropriation and he was satisfied with the relative strength of communists in Czechoslovakia compared to other Eastern Bloc countries.\n\nIn April 1945, the Third Republic was formed, led by a National Front of six parties. Because of the Communist Party's strength and Beneš's loyalty, unlike in other Central and Eastern European countries, the Kremlin did not require Eastern Bloc politics or \"reliable\" cadres in Czechoslovak power positions, and the executive and legislative branches retained their traditional structures. The Communists were the big winners in the 1946 elections, taking a total of 114 seats (they ran a separate list in Slovakia). Not only was this the only time a Communist Party won a free election anywhere in Europe during the Cold War era, but it was one of only two free elections ever held in the Soviet bloc, the other one having been held in Hungary a year earlier. Klement Gottwald, leader of the KSČ, became Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia.\n\nHowever, thereafter, the Soviet Union was disappointed that the government failed to eliminate \"bourgeois\" influence in the army, expropriate industrialists and large landowners and eliminate parties outside of the \"National Front\". Hope in Moscow was waning for a Communist victory in the 1948 elections following a May 1947 Kremlin report concluded that \"reactionary elements\" praising Western democracy had strengthened.\n\nFollowing Czechoslovakia's brief consideration of taking Marshall Plan funds, and the subsequent scolding of Communist parties by the Cominform at Szklarska Poręba in September 1947, Rudolf Slánský returned to Prague with a plan for the final seizure of power, including the StB's elimination of party enemies and purging of dissidents. Thereafter, Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin arranged a communist coup d'état, followed by the occupation of non-Communist ministers' ministries, while the army was confined to barracks.\n\nOn 25 February 1948, Beneš, fearful of civil war and Soviet intervention, capitulated and appointed a Communist-dominated government who was sworn in two days later. Although members of the other National Front parties still nominally figured, this was, for all intents and purposes, the start of out-and-out Communist rule in the country. Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, the only prominent Minister still left who wasn't either a Communist or fellow traveler, was found dead two weeks later. On 30 May, a single list of candidates from the National Front—now an organization dominated by the Communist Party—was elected to the National Assembly.\n\nAfter passage of the Ninth-of-May Constitution on 9 June 1948, the country became a People's Republic until 1960. Although it was not a completely Communist document, it was close enough to the Soviet model that Beneš refused to sign it. He'd resigned a week before it was finally ratified, and died in September. The Ninth-of-May Constitution confirmed that the KSČ possessed absolute power, as other Communist parties had in the Eastern Bloc. On 11 July 1960, the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia was promulgated, changing the name of the country from the \"\"Czechoslovak Republic\"\" to the \"\"Czechoslovak Socialist Republic\"\".\n\nWith the exception of the Prague Spring in the late-1960s, Czechoslovakia was characterized by the absence of democracy and competitiveness of its Western European counterparts as part of the Cold War. In 1969, the country became a federative republic comprising the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic.\n\nUnder the federation, social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the country were largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as Education, were formally transferred to the two republics. However, the centralized political control by the Communist Party severely limited the effects of federalization.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of the , represented (among others) by Václav Havel. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, making itself felt by limits on work activities (up to a ban on any professional employment and refusal of higher education to the dissident's children), police harassment and even prison time.\n\nIn late 1989, the country became a democracy again through the Velvet Revolution. In 1992, the Federal Assembly decided it would break up the country into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1 January 1993.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was bounded on the West by West Germany and East Germany, on the North by Poland, on the East by the Soviet Union (via the Ukrainian SSR) and on the South by Hungary and Austria.\n\nThe Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) led initially by First Secretary Klement Gottwald, held a monopoly on politics. Following the 1948 Tito-Stalin split and the Berlin Blockade, increased party purges occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc, including a purge of 550,000 party members of the KSČ, 30% of its members. Approximately 130,000 people were sent to prisons, and mines.\n\nThe evolution of the resulting harshness of purges in Czechoslovakia, like much of its history after 1948, was a function of the late takeover by the communists, with many of the purges focusing on the sizable numbers of party members with prior memberships in other parties. The purges accompanied various show trials, including those of Rudolf Slánský, Vladimír Clementis, Ladislav Novomeský and Gustáv Husák (Clementis was later executed). Slánský and eleven others were convicted together of being \"Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors\" in one series of show trials, after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague.\n\nAntonín Novotny served as First Secretary of the KSČ from 1953 to 1968. Gustáv Husák was elected first secretary of KSČ in 1969 (changed to General Secretary in 1971) and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to KSČ. All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under the umbrella of National Front of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.\n\nIn terms of political positions, the KSČ maintained the \"cadre\" and the \"nomenklatura\" lists, with the latter containing every post in each country that was important to the smooth application of party policy, including military posts, administrative positions, directors of local enterprises, social organization administrators, newspapers, etc. The KSČ's \"nomenklatura\" lists were thought to contain 100,000 post listings. The names of those that the party considered to be trustworthy enough to secure a \"nomenklatura\" post were compiled on the \"cadre\" list.\n\n\nCommunist-controlled Czechoslovakia was an active participant in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), Warsaw Pact, the UN and its specialized agencies, and Non-Aligned Movement; it was a signatory of conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n\nThe Czechoslovak economy was a centrally planned command economy with links controlled by the communist party, similar to the Soviet Union. It had a large metallurgical industry, but was dependent on imports for iron and nonferrous ores. Like the rest of the Eastern Bloc, producer goods were favored over consumer goods, causing consumer goods to be lacking in quantity and quality. This resulted in a shortage economy. Economic growth rates lagged well behind Czechoslovakia's western European counterparts. Investments made in industry did not yield the results expected, and consumption of energy and raw materials was excessive. Czechoslovak leaders themselves decried the economy's failure to modernize with sufficient speed.\n\n\nAfter World War II, the country was short on energy, relying on imported crude oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union, domestic brown coal, and nuclear and hydroelectric energy. Energy constraints were a major factor in 1980s.\n\nHomosexuality was decriminalized in 1962.\n\nHistorically, emigration has always been an option for Czechs and Slovaks dissatisfied with the situation at home. Each wave of emigration had its own impetus. In the 19th century, the reasons were primarily economic. In the 20th century, emigration was largely prompted by political turmoil, though economic factors still played a role. The first major wave of emigration in the 20th century came after the communists came to power, and the next wave began after the Prague Spring was suppressed.\n\nIn the 1980s, the most popular way to emigrate to the West was to travel to Yugoslavia by automobile and, once there, take a detour to Greece, Austria, or Italy (Yugoslav border restrictions were not as strict as those of the Warsaw Pact nations). Only a small percentage of those who applied to emigrate legally could do so. The exact details of the process have never been published, but a reasonably clear picture can be gleaned from those who succeeded. It was a lengthy and costly process. Those applicants allowed to even consider emigration were required to repay the state for their education, depending on their level of education and salary, at a rate ranging from 4,000 Kčs to 10,000 Kčs. (The average yearly wage was about Kčs33,600 in 1984.) The applicant was likely to lose his job and be socially ostracized.\n\nTechnically, at least, such emigres would be allowed to return for visits. Those who had been politically active, such as Charter 77 signatories, found it somewhat easier to emigrate, but they were not allowed to return and reportedly had to pay the state exorbitant fees—Kčs23,000 to as much as Kčs80,000—if they had graduated from a university. Old-age pensioners had no problem visiting or emigrating to the West. The reasons for this were purely economic; if they decided to stay in the West, the state no longer had to pay their pension.\n\nThere is (and always was) a huge discrepancy between \"official statistics\" (i.e. numbers issued by the communist regime) on how many people emigrated from Czechoslovakia and \"illegal refugee\" statistics published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This discrepancy was not specific to Czechoslovakia only; a similar situation applied for all Eastern Bloc countries, as their authoritarian regimes preferred to downplay and suppress real numbers.\n\nOfficial statistics for the early 1980s show that, on the average, 3,500 people emigrated legally each year. From 1965 to 1983, a total of 33,000 people emigrated legally. This figure undoubtedly included a large number of ethnic Germans resettled in East Germany. The largest émigré communities are located in Austria, West Germany, the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nUnofficial figures are much larger. It is estimated that between 1948 and 1989 close to 1 million people left communist-ruled Czechoslovakia. The largest exoduses occurred following the communist takeover in February 1948 and following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, with around 200,000 people leaving in each wave. A very similar 200,000-strong refugee wave left Hungary in 1956 after their failed anti-communist revolution. In the 1950s, when the regime was at its harshest and the \"Iron Curtain\" was close to impenetrable, emigration was very low. It increased between 1969 and 1989, when close to 40,000 people were leaving the country each year. All of them were sentenced to imprisonment \"in absentia\" by the communist regime for leaving the country illegally.\n\nReligion was oppressed and attacked in communist-era Czechoslovakia. In 1991, 46.4% were Roman Catholics, Atheists made up 29.5%, 5.3% were Evangelical Lutherans, and 16.7% were n/a, but there were huge differences between the 2 constituent republics – see Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nAfter World War II, free health care was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine; factory and local health-care centers supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. Substantial improvement in rural health care in 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe mass media in Czechoslovakia was controlled by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this informational monopoly in the hands of organizations under KSČ control, all publications were reviewed by the government's \"Office for Press and Information.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Lee played with the San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates of the Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\nLee was a World Series champion with the Marlins in 2003, and he won the National League batting title in 2005. He was a two-time All-Star selection, and won the Gold Glove Award three times.\n\nLee was born on September 6, 1975 in Sacramento, California. Leon Lee is his father and Leron Lee is his uncle. Each of them played professional baseball in Japan. During his elementary years Lee lived in Japan, and during his high school years he often lived there during his summer breaks. He played Little League Baseball at Whitney Little League and graduated from El Camino High School in 1993.\n\nLee was drafted in the first round (14th overall) of the 1993 MLB draft by the San Diego Padres, and made his MLB debut on April 28, 1997.\n\nTraded, along with prospects, to the Florida Marlins a year later for Kevin Brown, Lee was a member of the 2003 World Series Marlins championship team. Lee won his first Gold Glove during the 2003 championship season and his spectacular grab and unassisted putout on a hard hit Hideki Matsui one-hop line drive snuffed out a Yankees rally and ended Game 5 of the World Series with a Marlins victory. The Marlins went on to win the World Series in Game 6.\n\nLee was traded to the Cubs for Hee-seop Choi. He hit .278 with 32 home runs and 98 RBIs in his first year with the Cubs. In , Lee had a career first half of the season, with an MLB-leading .376 batting average, 72 RBIs, and a tie for the major league lead in home runs with 27.\n\nThe Cubs had traded superstar Sammy Sosa, who had previously been one of their best hitters, before the 2005 season. Lee showed early on that he could more than compensate for the loss, and while Sosa had a disappointing 2005 season with the Baltimore Orioles, Lee had a career year. By midseason, he was among MLB's leaders in each of the triple crown categories: batting average, home runs, and RBIs. Lee hit his 200th career home run on August 28, , off Florida Marlins starter Josh Beckett. He finished the year with a career-best 46 home runs. His .335 batting average was the highest by a Cub since Bill Madlock's .339 in and made him the first Cub since Bill Buckner in to win a National League batting title. He also finished third in NL MVP voting and won the NL Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards at first base that year.\n\nLee was named to the U.S. roster for the World Baseball Classic, where he was the first player to hit a home run for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nOn April 10, , Lee signed a five-year, $65 million extension with the Chicago Cubs. The deal replaced his contract for the 2006 season and extended him as the Cubs' first baseman through the 2010 season and included a no-trade clause. He broke his wrist less than two weeks later, in a collision involving baserunner Rafael Furcal, and he missed 59 games due to the injury. The Cubs posted a 19–40 record during Lee's stint on the disabled list. Later, Lee went back on the disabled list with a post-traumatic inflammation in the outer bone of the medial side of the wrist.\n\nIn 2008, Lee hit 20 home runs, 90 RBIs and had a .291 batting average as the Cubs had the best regular-season record in the National League, leading the Cubs to the NL Central championship, later losing in the NLDS to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 3-0. In 2009, Lee ranked ninth in the voting for NL MVP, as he had a .306 batting average, and hit for 35 home runs and 111 RBIs.\n\nOn June 9, 2010, Lee hit his 300th career home run in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nOn June 25, 2010, Lee was involved in a dugout altercation with Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano after the pitcher gave up four runs in the first inning and apparently blamed Lee for failing to field a sharply-hit lead-off double. Zambrano was suspended for his behavior.\n\nIn late July 2010 Lee used his ten and five rights to veto a trade to the Los Angeles Angels. On August 18, 2010, Lee, with his approval, was traded to the Atlanta Braves for minor league pitching prospects Robinson Lopez, Tyrelle Harris, and Jeffrey Lorick. Lee began to serve as the Braves' starting first baseman on August 20, 2010, including postseason play in the NLDS.\n\nLee was signed from free agency to a one-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles for the 2011 season. He played in 85 games with the struggling Orioles, batting .246 with 12 home runs and 41 runs batted in.\n\nOn July 30, 2011, Lee was traded to the Pirates for minor league Class A first baseman Aaron Baker and cash considerations. Lee hit two home runs in his first game as a Pirate. He was hit by a pitch and broke a bone in his left wrist on August 3, and missed most of the next month, but then finished the season productively as the Pittsburgh first baseman. Playing in 28 games as a Pirate in 2011, Lee batted .337 with 7 home runs and 18 RBIs.\n\nLee is the son of Leon Lee. Leon never played in the Major Leagues, but did play professionally in Japan. Today, he is a scout for Major League Baseball and, coincidentally, he was the scout who \"found\" Hee-Seop Choi who was later traded for his son. Lee is the nephew of former Major League outfielder Leron Lee, who played eight seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Dodgers, Indians, and Padres. Currently, he works with the Cincinnati Reds as an advising batting coach to scouted players.\n\nIn September 2006, Lee's three-year-old daughter Jada was diagnosed with Leber's congenital amaurosis, a rare genetic disease resulting in loss of vision. Lee and Boston Celtics co-owner and CEO Wyc Grousbeck with the University of Iowa established Project 3000 in an effort to eradicate the disease, which affects both their families. Lee guest starred in an episode of NBC's drama series \"ER\", \"Gravity\", which was first broadcast in October 2007. Lee agreed to the brief appearance because the producers of \"ER\" aired an episode in January 2008 that deals with Leber's congenital amaurosis. Lee's efforts to raise awareness and funds for research into the condition have helped to raise over $1,000,000 of additional research funds. An eventual cure for the disease depends greatly on getting data on patients and Lee's support has had a significant impact both in fundraising and testing patients who have the disease.\n\nIn 2009, Lee revealed that Jada had been misdiagnosed and does not have the disease, but Lee continues to be active in raising money for Project 3000.\n\nThe 1st Touch Foundation was established in 2005 by Lee and his wife as a vehicle to encourage and support the educational aspirations of the community's young people. The initial vision was to build The 1st Touch Academic Youth Center in Sacramento, California. In 2009, Lee unveiled a cabernet wine called CaberLee through Charity Wines where 100% of the proceeds will benefit the 1st Touch Foundation. However, in September 2012, the foundation closed after helping children in Sacramento for seven years.\n\nLee has visited countries such as Uganda and Israel to help out with the baseball programs. He visited the Israel Baseball Academy in 2015 helping them out with skills while visiting the country.\n\n"}
{"id": "1810982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810982", "title": "T. T. Martin", "text": "T. T. Martin\n\nT. T. Martin, in full Thomas Theodore Martin (born 1862 in Smith County, Mississippi, died May 23, 1939) was a Christian evangelist who became one of the most important figures of the anti-evolution movement in the 1920s. When the Anti-Evolution League of Minnesota founded by the dynamic William Bell Riley of the First Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, blossomed into the Anti-Evolution League of America in 1923, it was with Kentucky preacher Dr. J. W. Porter as president and Martin as field secretary and editor of the organization's official organ, \"The Conflict\". Martin would go on to become the secretary general of the North Carolina Anti-Evolution League, and an official of the Bible Crusaders. \n\n\"Hell and the High Schools\", first published in 1922, attacked the theory of evolution and the teaching of evolution in tax-supported schools as \"the greatest curse that ever fell upon this earth\". In Martin's view this was an even greater sin than when the Germans poisoned wells and gave children poisoned candy during World War I. Martin wanted parents to pressure school boards and state legislatures to take steps to stop the teaching of evolution. The following is an example of Martin's prose style from the book:\n\nMartin defended anti-evolution laws by claiming that they protected the individual liberty of religious students. \"Christ or Evolution\" was his other significant work, and is in a similar vein, constituting a colorful pair of diatribes if not outright polemics on the subject. Both works are representative of the anti-evolution rhetoric of this period. Granted, Martin was not as eloquent as William Jennings Bryan, but then there was nobody in the movement on the same level as the Great Commoner. However, Martin proved to be just as influential in getting anti-evolution laws passed, which is what makes these two works of great interest to those studying the history of the conflict between Christianity and science over evolution in this country and a struggle that is now almost a century old.\n\nMartin showed up for the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, where he rented a store as a book shop on which he hung a giant sign that promoted his books. Also sold were Martin's \"Evolution or Christ\", Bryan's \"In His Image\", Alfred W. McCann's \"God--or Gorilla?\", and B.H. Shadduck's \"Puddle to Paradise\". The best sellers proved to be \"Hell and the High Schools\" and the Adventist science educator George McCready Price's \"The Phantom of Organic Evolution\". (Price was Bryan's main authority in his only speech in court during the trial.) \n\nDuring the trial Martin preached on the streets of Dayton and once cornered H.L. Mencken in the Rhea County Courthouse and demanded to know if he was converted or not. During a second encounter outside of Robinson's Drug Store, Mencken told Martin there was a group of Bolsheviks arriving in town to murder Bryan, which sent the preacher to warn the local police that the ACLU was sending assassins to kill Bryan and other Christian notables. Martin gave his permit to preach from the public platform one evening to Charles Francis Potter, provided the Modernist minister did not preach about evolution. (Martin was under the same prohibition, and Potter made a plea for liberal education as the basis for values instead.)\n\nIn February 1926 a monkey bill similar to Tennessee's Butler Act was introduced in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Martin and others from Washburn's Bible Crusaders arrived to lobby the legislators, and the bill passed 76 to 32. In the state Senate there was a heated debate, during which an opponent proposed an amendment to make the penalty \"death by burning at the stake, it being the spirit of this bill to restore the Spanish Inquisition.\" The amendment was defeated but the bill passed, 29 to 16, and was signed by Governor Henry L. Whitfield. While Chancellor Hume of the University of Mississippi argued the law would force the state's teachers to be intellectually dishonest, the superintendent of the high school in Meridian held a public bonfire to burn all pages about evolution from textbooks used in his school. An ACLU offer to assist any Mississippi taxpayer or member of the American Association of University Professors in a suit to challenge the case was ignored given what had happened in Dayton to John T. Scopes. \n\nBecause of Martin's efforts, and rhetoric in keeping with these anti-evolution writings, Mississippi became one of only two states to pass and keep anti-evolution legislation on the books in the wake of the Scopes Trial. The other state was Arkansas, and it was that state's law that was the basis of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that anti-evolution laws were unconstitutional in \"Epperson vs. Arkansas\", 393 U.S. 97 (1968).\n\nMartin died on May 23, 1939, and was buried at Gloster, Mississippi. On his gravestone were carved the three Scripture texts which were the core of his ministry: John 3:16, Acts 16:31, and John 5:24.\n"}

He currently serves as Professor Emeritus of Ethics, Philosophy of Religion, and Ecology at the Rio de Janeiro State University. In 2001, he received the Right Livelihood Award for \"his inspiring insights and practical work to help people realise the links between human spirituality, social justice and environmental stewardship.\"\n\nBoff was born in Concórdia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, he entered the Franciscan Order in 1959 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1964. He spent the following years studying for a doctorate in theology and philosophy at the University of Munich, which he received in 1970. Boff's doctoral thesis studied in what measure the Church can be a sign of the sacred and the divine in the secular world and in the process of liberation of the oppressed. He has since published his thesis as a book available in German, entitled \"Die Kirche als Sakrament im Horizont der Welterfahrung\".\n\nHis brother is the theologian Clodovis Boff.\n\nBoff became one of the best-known supporters (along with Gustavo Gutiérrez, Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino) of the early liberation theologians. He was present in the first reflections that sought to articulate indignation against poverty and marginalization with a promissory discourse on faith, leading to liberation theology. He continues to be a controversial figure in the Catholic Church, primarily for his sharp criticism of the church's hierarchy, which he sees as \"fundamentalist\", but also for his political positions.\n\nBoff is critical of secular power as well of American foreign policy. He opposed the Iraq War and considered George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon's leadership to be similar to that of \"fundamentalist terrorist states.\" He also criticizes despotic rulers in the Middle East: \"Those [emirs and kings] are despotic, they do not even have a constitution. Though extremely rich, they maintain the people in poverty.\"\n\nBoff has voiced his supported for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\n\nAuthorities in the Roman Catholic Church did not consider Boff's views of the Church's leadership acceptable. They also saw his support of liberation theology as having \"politicized everything\" and reproached his proximity to Marxism. In 1985, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, directed at that time by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), silenced him for a year for his book \"Church: Charism and Power\". He later accused Ratzinger of \"religious terrorism\".\n\nBoff was almost silenced again in 1992 by Rome, this time to prevent him from participating in the Eco-92 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which finally led him to leave the Franciscan religious order and the priestly ministry. \n\nBoff joined the international group of Catholic Scholars who in 2012 issued the Jubilee Declaration on reform of authority in the Catholic Church.\n\nFor most of his life Boff has worked as a professor in the academic fields of theology, ethics and philosophy throughout Brazil and also as lecturer in many universities abroad such as University of Lisbon, University of Barcelona, University of Lund, University of Oslo, University of Torino and others.\n\nBoff commented on the election of Pope Francis in March 2013: \"I am encouraged by this choice, viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals.\" He said the new pope was conservative in many respects but had liberal views on some subjects as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1810990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810990", "title": "Project Sherwood", "text": "Project Sherwood\n\nProject Sherwood was the codename for a United States program in controlled nuclear fusion during the period it was classified. The prospect of turning cheap and inexhaustible hydrogen into inexpensive power captured the imagination of Lewis Strauss, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman from 1953 to 1958, who believed fusion reactors could generate electricity \"too cheap to meter\".\n\nSherwood developed out of a number of \"ad hoc\" efforts dating back to about 1951. Primary among these was the stellarator program at Princeton University, itself code-named Project Matterhorn. Since then the weapons labs had clamoured to join the club, Los Alamos with its z-pinch efforts, Livermore's magnetic mirror program, and later, Oak Ridge's fuel injector efforts. By 1953 the combined budgets were increasing into the million dollar range, demanding some sort of oversight at the AEC level.\n\nThe name \"Sherwood\" was suggested by Paul McDaniel, Deputy Director of the AEC. He noted that funding for the wartime Hood Building was being dropped and moved to the new program, so they \"robbing Hood to pay Friar Tuck\", a reference to the British physicist and fusion researcher James L. Tuck. The connection to Robin Hood and Friar Tuck gave the project its name.\n\nStrauss strongly supported keeping the program secret until pressure from the United Kingdom led to a declassification effort at the 2nd Atoms for Peace meeting in the fall of 1958. After this time a number of purely civilian organizations also formed to organize meetings on the topic, with the American Physical Society organizing meetings under their Division of Plasma Physics. These meetings have been carried on to this day and were renamed International Sherwood Fusion Theory Conference. The original Project Sherwood became simply the Controlled Thermonuclear Research program within the AEC and its follow-on organizations.\n\nResearch centered on three plasma confinement designs; the stellarator headed by Lyman Spitzer at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, the toroidal pinch or Perhapsatron led by James Tuck at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the magnetic mirror devices at the Livermore National Laboratory led by Richard F. Post. By June, 1954 a preliminary study had been completed for a full scale \"Model D\" stellarator that would be over long and produce 5,000 MW of electricity at a capital cost of $209 per kilowatt. However, each concept encountered unanticipated problems, in the form of plasma instabilities that prevented the requisite temperatures and pressures from being achieved, and it eventually became clear that sustained hydrogen fusion would not be developed quickly. Strauss left AEC in 1958 and his successor did not share Strauss' enthusiasm for fusion research. Consequently, Project Sherwood was relegated from a crash program to one that concentrated on basic research.\n\nThe funding for Project Sherwood began with the closure of another program called Project Lincoln at the Hood Laboratory. As the number of people working on the projects grew, so did the budget. Under Strauss the program was reorganized, and its funding and staffing increased dramatically. From early 1954 to 1955, the number of people working on Project Sherwood grew from 45 to 110. By the next year, that number had doubled. The original budget from the shut down of Project Lincoln was $1 million. The breakdown of the year budget from 1951 to 1957 can be seen in the table below. At its peak, Project Sherwood had a budget of $23 million per year and retained more than 500 scientists.\nThe declassification of the program was a large topic of discussion between scientists at all of the laboratories involved with the project and at the Sherwood conferences. The reasoning for an initial high classification status was that if the research into controlled fusion were to be successful then it would be a significant advantage in regards to military aspects. However, it came to the point that the research needed to be industrialized. Some of this work could be conducted without access to the classified information; however, there were some instances where the classified information of the program was a necessity for those people working on projects such as the large-scale stellarator, the ultra-high vacua, and the problem of energy storage. In these instances, there was a contract with the Commission that the information that was being used would only be shared with the personnel that was directly working on the project. It soon became apparent that industrial companies were expected to become highly invested in the area of fission and because of this it became clear that these companies should have full access to the research information obtained by Project Sherwood. In June 1956, permits for the research information from Project Sherwood became available through the Commission for companies that were qualified. However, between 1955 and 1958, information became more and more available to the public with its gradual declassification beginning with the sharing of information with the United Kingdom. Huge supporters of declassification of the program included the director of the Division of Research, Thomas Johnson, and a member of his staff, Amasa Bishop. Some of their reasoning for wanting declassification was that the secrecy of the project could negatively impact their ability to enlist and employ experienced personnel to the program. The also argued that it would change the way their conferences could be held. The scientists working on the project would be able to freely discuss their findings with others in the scientific community rather than only the scientists working on the same project. By May 1958, basic information about the various projects within Project Sherwood including the stellarator, magnetic mirrors, and molecular ion beams had been released to the public.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory was composed of a small group of scientists that were mostly experienced with research in ion-source technology. However, research from Project Sherwood was a growing area of interest, and the researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory wanted to participate in the discovery of controlled fusion. They studied areas of controlled fusion such as the rate of plasma diffusion in a magnetic field and the charge-exchange process. However, their work with ion-source was still a large part of their research.\n\nAlthough there was already a main project (magnetic mirror) at the University of California, scientist W. R. Baker began research into the pinch effect at UCRL, Berkeley in 1952. Two years later, S. Colgate began research on shock-heating at UCRL, Livermore.\n\nThere was another small group of scientists at Tufts College in Medford, Massachusetts that had become involved in research of the pinch effect. Although their work was not officially part of the Atomic Energy Commission, some of their personnel attended the Sherwood conferences.\n\nIn 1954, there was a program started at New York University called the Division of Research. It was a small program that included personnel from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.\n\n\n"}

The campus' first two buildings were the Administration/Library building and Goodwyn Hall with classrooms and faculty offices.\n\nAUM has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) as an operationally separate institution from Auburn University since 1978.\n\nAuburn University at Montgomery earned recognition from \"U.S. News & World Report\" and \"Princeton Review\" for the quality of its academic programs in 2018. U.S. News ranked AUM 22nd among regional universities in the South for the quality of its undergraduate teaching and 38th among public comprehensive universities in the South.\n\nFor the 2018-19 academic year, AUM enrolled 4,632 undergraduate and 579 graduate students. The student body is 65 percent female and 34 percent male. Forty-five percent of students are white, 40 percent are black, 2 percent are Asian, 1 percent are Hispanic, and 5 percent are international students.\nAUM comprises five Colleges (Business, Education, Nursing and Health Sciences, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, and Sciences) that offer bachelor, master and specialist degree programs. The most popular bachelor's degrees granted are business administration, nursing, liberal arts, biology, elementary education and secondary education. The university's nursing and medical laboratory sciences programs boast placement rates of more than 90 percent. AUM offers a joint doctorate program with Auburn University in Public Administration, and now offers a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree.\n\nAUM has a continuing education program that enrolls over 10,000 students annually. Continuing Education curricula include certificate programs, corporate education, community education, computer training, languages (including English as a Foreign or Second Language), online training, and youth programs.\n\nAUM's College of Business ranks in the top 5% of business schools in the world, as accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, and was rated a \"Best Business School\" by \"The Princeton Review\".\n\nAnnual lectures include the Durr Lectures (since 1992), named for Clifford and Virginia Durr, Montgomery lawyers and civil rights activists; and the Ingram Lectures (since 1989), named for Robert Ingram, noted political analyst and journalist.\n\nAUM offers apartment-style residence halls with floor plans including up to four bedrooms. Housing is divided into four communities: P40 Place, The Courtyards, The Commons, and Warhawk Hall. P40 Place, which opened in the Fall of 2016, is named after the P-40 Warhawk aircraft of the World War II era that served as the inspiration for AUM's Curtiss The Warhawk mascot. The Courtyards residence opened in fall 1979 and is made up of seven two-story buildings. In 2003 the eight-story complex known as The Commons, featuring private 4-bedroom suites, was opened, and in fall 2013, Warhawk Hall was opened. Approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of AUM students live on campus during the regular school year.\n\nAuburn University at Montgomery teams, nicknamed athletically as the Warhawks, completed their first year as provisional members of the Gulf South Conference during the 2017–18 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) season. AUM is currently in its third year of the NCAA Division II membership process, working toward full acceptance in the 2019-20 academic year. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.\n\nAUM participated in the NAIA for approximately 30 years. However, AUM has routinely explored possible future participation in NCAA Division II. AUM was accepted into the membership process to NCAA Division II on July 12, 2013, but the decision was then reversed on July 26, 2013. AUM was expected to join the Peach Belt Conference in 2014–15, but this will apparently be set aside with the NCAA's refusal to admit the school. However, the school re-applied and was approved to begin the three-year Division II membership process on July 17, 2015 and will begin the transition beginning with the 2015–16 season, while joining the Gulf South Conference for all sports effective in the 2017–18 season.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, AUM officially changed the name of its sports teams from the Senators to the Warhawks.\n\nWhile participating in the NAIA, AUM teams won 25 national championship, 14 by the women's tennis team (1992, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015), nine by the men's tennis team (1987, 1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010) and most-recently consecutive championships by the softball team (2014, 2015). In addition, 22 teams finished as national runners-up. Individually, a student-athlete was named to a NAIA All-America team 451 times and 135 times a student-athlete was selected a NAIA Scholar-Athlete for their work in the classroom. On 32 occasions, an AUM head coach was selected National Coach of the Year. AUM teams have won a combined 107 conference or district championships and made 107 NAIA National Tournament appearances.\n\n\n"}

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Spata-Artemida, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit (officially named \"Spata-Loutsa\") has an area of 55.042 km.\n\nSpata is situated in the middle of the Mesogeia plain, east of Mount Hymettus and west of the Aegean Sea coast. Athens International Airport (\"Eleftherios Venizelos\") covers the eastern portion of Spata. It is located southeast of Pallini, southwest of Rafina, west of Artemida and about east south east of Athens.\n\nThe town proper is made up of residential neighborhoods. Farmland, mostly vineyards and olive groves, lie around. Retsina wine was the traditional cash crop of the whole area, complemented with olives and olive oil, figs, almonds, pistachios, and wheat. Nowadays viticulture is dwindling as a mass occupation, albeit supplanted by the emergence of many modern wineries that mostly specialize in vinifying the local Savatiano grape. The bulk of the grape and wine business is handled by the local co-operative. In 1995, the southern portion was committed to construction of the new Athens International Airport, which was completed in March 2001. The Attica Zoological Park, or \"Attica Zoo\", opened in May 2001 and is Athens' and Greece's largest zoo.\n\nSpata has five kindergartens, three elementary schools, two secondary schools, a police station, Post Office, several bank offices, and a junior football/soccer team, \"Aittitos\" (Invincible). The training facilities of AEK FC are also located there.\n\nThe municipal unit of Spáta also incorporates various small exurbs: Agía Kyriakí (pop. 886 in 2011), Neápoli (584), Ágios Ioánnis (284), Velanidiá (257), Christoúpolis (518), Foínikas (113), Étos Stéko (87), Ágios Nikólaos Boúra (195), and Ímeros Péfkos (211).\n\nThe area included the ancient Athenian demes of Erkhiá (Ερχιά), the birthplace of the historian and general Xenophon, and Kýthēros (Κύθηρος); a Mycenean cemetery has been excavated at the southern edge of town, the exhibits being hosted in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Evidence of small ancient settlements abound in the area, the most notable being the Neolithic fortified settlement on Zágani hill. Several of these were excavated during works for the airport and are being exhibited in the main airport building.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, Spata has been inhabited by Arvanites. The town (then village) was repopulated by the medieval Tosk clan of Shpata around the 15th century, after they emigrated from Epirus. It was named after Gjin Bua Shpata, who was despot of Arta in the 14th century.\n\nThe patron saints of the town are the SS. Peter and Paul, celebrated on July 29 at the Byzantine chapel of the same name, located near the eastern edge of the town. The feast is accompanied by the medieval custom of the distribution of the stifado, a beef-and-onions stew cooked overnight in cauldrons and distributed to the faithful outside the chapel after Mass.\n\nOlympic Air has its head office in Athens International Airport in Spata. Goody's S.A., a Greek fast food company, is also headquartered at the airport.\n\nThe Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board has an office at the airport.\n"}

{"id": "1811047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811047", "title": "Provadia", "text": "Provadia\n\nProvadia () is a town in northeastern Bulgaria, part of Varna Province, located in a deep karst gorge (Provadia syncline) along the Provadiya River not far from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. It is the administrative centre of Provadia Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 12,901 inhabitants.\n\nProvadia served as a customs point since ancient times. It is well known for salty mineral waters, its mild climate and a total of 70 km of caves in the surrounding mountain walls. It can be reached by train from Sofia or Varna and there are also hourly buses from and to Varna, and a sophisticated road system.\n\nProvadia is the site of Solnitsata, Europe's oldest prehistoric town. Excavations on city walls that started in 2005 reveal a town that dates back to between 4,700 BC and 4,200 BC. It is believed to have been the site of salt trading.\n\nHistorical names of the medieval fortress, the ruins of which have been preserved until today, include \"Provat\" (Byzantine Greek), \"Ovech\" (Овеч, Bulgarian), \"Provanto\" (Italian) and \"Pravadı\" (Turkish language). The Greek name and its adaptations stem from the word πρόβατο, \"provato\", \"sheep\", and the medieval Bulgarian name corresponds directly (being derived from овца, \"ovtsa\", with the same meaning). The fortress is open for visitors. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages the town was a key centre of the First Bulgarian Empire with an important monastery at the modern village of Ravna, the church of which was consecrated on 23 April 897, and a major scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School. The rebel leader and subsequently emperor of Bulgaria Ivailo defeated a 10,000-strong Byzantine army near the city in 1279. During the Second Bulgarian Empire it was the seat of a metropolitan in the 14th century. Ovech was captured by the Ottomans in 1388 after a long siege.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th century Provadia was a commercial centre of the Ottoman Empire and was inhabited by many Jewish and Ragusan merchants. A 16th-17th-century Dubrovnik-style church still stands in the nearby village of Dobrina.\n\nSouth of Provadia lies the largest rock salt mine in Bulgaria, which is believed to be virtually inexhaustible with a salt dome up to 3900 m high, and has been sporadically exploited for some 7500 years but industrially, through leaching, only since the 1960s; now it is part of Solvay Sodi AD in Devnya under the name Provadsol AD. Some of the leaching caverns are used for the storage of natural gas. Provadia is an important hub on both the Druzhba Gas Pipeline and as of 2015 abandoned South Stream. Other industrial facilities include a modern biodiesel installation, a sunflower oil mill, a heavy earth-mover repair plant, shipbuilding machinery and textile factories. The town has a certain potential as a spa centre; its saline mineral water is allegedly similar in composition to the one at Karlovy Vary. \n\nPlaces of interest include the Lambova Kashta ethnographical complex and ethnographical collections in Dobrina and Manastir villages, as well as cave monasteries and the ruins of the 9-10th-century Ravna Monastery, one of the most important centres of the Preslav Literary School, dubbed \"language laboratory\" by Umberto Eco for its graffiti by common folks in several languages and alphabets. \n\nProvadiya Hook in Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Provadia.\n\nThe current mayor of the town is Zhoro Ilchev, elected in 2019.\n\nProvadia is the seat of Provadia municipality (part of Varna Province), which also includes the following 24 villages:\n\n\n"}

Born in Gaul, he was enslaved by the Romans under unknown circumstances and trained as a gladiator in Capua. His name means \"one with curly hair\" in Gaulish.\n\nIn 73 BC, Crixus was part of what started as a small slave revolt in the gladiatorial training school of Lentulus Batiatus in Capua, in which about 70 gladiators escaped. The escaped slaves defeated a small force sent to recapture them, then made camp on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Word of the escaped gladiators' revolt spread, and other escaped slaves started to join their ranks. At this time, the band of former slaves chose Crixus—with the Thracian Spartacus, and the Gaul Oenomaus - as one of their leaders. Later in the rebellion, another Gaul, Castus, and Celtic former Gladiator Gannicus also served as generals under Spartacus.\n\nThe movement, in the course of what would come to be known as the Third Servile War, witnessed numerous military successes for the escaped slaves. They routed the militia forces the Roman Senate sent to put down the insurrection by rappelling down the cliffs of Mount Vesuvius and attacking the Roman camp from behind. With these early successes, thousands of fellow slaves swarmed to their ranks, until their numbers swelled to perhaps as many as 150,000.\n\nFor reasons that are unclear, Crixus and about 30,000 followers appear to have separated from Spartacus and the main body of escaped slaves toward the end of 73 BC. Contemporary historians have theorized two possible reasons for the split. One theory proposes that Crixus and his followers were intent on plundering the Roman countryside and, perhaps, marching on Rome, while Spartacus and his followers wanted to cross the Alps to reach Gaul and freedom. A second theory is that the split had strategic value and was planned by Spartacus and Crixus as a way to further their strategic goals.\n\nWhatever the reason for the split, Crixus' contingent encountered a Roman army under the command of the Roman consul Lucius Gellius Publicola near Mount Gargano in 72 BC. Crixus, who is said to have fought bravely in a losing effort, was killed in the conflict.\n\nSpartacus, on hearing of the defeat of Crixus and his forces, held mock gladiatorial games, in which he forced captured Roman soldiers to fight to the death. Either 300 or 400 Romans were sacrificed in Crixus' honor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811065", "title": "William Bell Riley", "text": "William Bell Riley\n\nWilliam Bell Riley (March 22, 1861 in Greene County, Indiana, USA – December 5, 1947 in Golden Valley, Minnesota) was known as \"The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism.\" After being educated at normal school in Valparaiso, Indiana, Riley received his teacher's certificate. After teaching in county schools, he attended college in Hanover, Indiana, where he received an A.B. degree in 1885. In 1888 he graduated from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1908, the Southwestern Baptist University of Jackson, Tennessee, conferred upon Riley an honorary D.D. degree. He served several Baptist churches in Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois before taking the pastorate at the First Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1897.\n\nIn 1878, at the age of 17, Riley publicly professed faith in Christ. He had planned to study law, but shortly after his conversion he felt called to the ministry. He became pastor of the First Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota on March 1, 1897. He resigned after forty-five years but served as pastor emeritus until his death five years later. Riley wrote a number of texts on Christian Evangelism and founded the Northwestern Bible Training School along with an Evangelical Seminary.\n\nTheologically, Riley was a Baptist traditionalist who subscribed to the New Hampshire Confession of Faith of 1833, the most popular Baptist creed of the 19th century. His first major work was an exposition of the Confession and in 1922 he tried to help the fundamentalist faction of the Northern Baptist Convention gain control and reject theological liberalism by convincing the Convention to adopt the Confession as its binding statement of faith.\n\nRiley was the editor of \"The Christian Fundamentalist\" from 1927 to 1932. In 1919 Riley founded the World Christian Fundamentals Association. Riley was president of the Minnesota Baptist State Convention in 1944-45. When Riley died in 1947, Billy Graham, whom Riley had chosen to succeed him as president of Northwestern, conducted the funeral services. At Riley's death Northwestern Bible School was the second largest Bible School in the world, with some 1,200 students enrolled.\n\nIn 1923 Riley set up the Anti-Evolution League of Minnesota, which blossomed the following year into the Anti-Evolution League of America (later run by T. T. Martin). While the anti-evolution crusade is often thought of as a Southern phenomenon, two of its foremost leaders, Riley and John Roach Straton, were from Minneapolis and New York City respectively. In the early 1920s Riley promoted a vigorous anti-evolutionary campaign in the Northwest and it was Riley's World Christian Fundamentals Association that wired William Jennings Bryan urging him to act as counsel for the association in the Scopes Trial.\n\nRiley and Bryan tried to remove all teaching of evolution from public schools. One of the creationists in their movement, T. T. Martin claimed that German soldiers who killed Belgian and French children by giving them poisoned candy were angels compared to those who spread evolution ideas in schools. Riley also claimed that \"an international Jewish-Bolshevik-Darwinist conspiracy to promote evolutionism in the classroom\" was behind the changes in curriculum occurring in the 1920s. Riley advocated a form of \"Day-Age Creationism\".\n\nThe main objection that Riley had to evolution was:\n\nSome of Riley's beliefs and writings were anti-semitic. He wrote and spoke extensively about Jews, especially in relation to Communism, crime and historical social influence. He promoted the antisemitic canard of linking Jews with mysterious sources of influence, power and money. In his Introduction to a collection of Riley's anti-evolutionary writings William Trollinger, the editor, describes Riley's belief in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to control the media and the economy. Trollinger believed Riley was partly influenced by the anti-Jewish Czarist forgery \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". Henry Ford had been promoting the Protocols at that time through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent. Riley believed that Jews had a prominent role in promoting evolution to undermine religious and social values. Riley saw this as part of a wider plot involving Communism's plan to conquer America, especially through the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom he accused of being part of a communist conspiracy. Riley declared that Soviet Russia \"was under the dominance of a successful mob of atheistic Jews.\" Riley described the origins of World War I as the result of the maneuvering of Jewish bankers and arms dealers. Riley preached a sermon entitled \"Shivering at the sight of a shirt\" in support of the Fascist Silver Shirts (of the Silver Legion of America) calling them \"defenders of the Constitution.\" In his book, \"The Nazi Hydra in America: Suppressed History of a Century\", Glen Yeadon compares Riley's use of anti-Jewish imagery and rhetoric in his sermons and writings to Hitler's propaganda.\n\nSome writers think that Riley moved towards anti Semitism after the failure of his crusade against evolution, blaming the Jews for his inability to influence Schools against teaching evolution. Trollinger also argues that Riley was influenced by and became a leading part of the anti-Semitism prevalent in Minneapolis. There were also parts of wider fundamentalist culture at that time adopting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nRiley denied that he was an anti-Semite. He argued that he was merely commenting on social conditions at the time, and that he theologically and personally supported the Jews. Soon after the British Army entered Jerusalem in 1917, Riley described his hopes of a restored Jewish state and the role of Jerusalem in end time events in a published sermon. Riley also believed that Jews as a race had been \"under God's punishment\", similar to the theology of Medieval antisemitism. Riley continued to be a supporter of more modern manifestations of anti-Semitism, such as belief in a worldwide Jewish-Bolshevik-Darwinist conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

That same year, Coleman released an album titled \"Jonathan Coleman's Polka Project\". A single from that release, \"Busy Bleeding\", under the pseudonym Wide Boy Youth, peaked at 53 on the ARIA Charts (at the time, compiled using the Kent Music Report).\n\nIn 1988 he had a part in the Australian movie \"Young Einstein\".\n\nIn 1988 Jono and Dano began hosting a new music television programme on The Seven Network. \"Saturday Morning Live\" was broadcast from Sydney, nationally from 9 am to 12:30 pm every Saturday morning. The programme was a mixture of music videos, live performances, interviews with musicians and performers, location items and comedy performances (usually in character by Jono & Dano). The show was immediately popular and soon became the most watched music programme on Australian television.\n\nFor the second season of \"Saturday Morning Live\" in 1989 the producers decided to expand on the comedy aspect and introduced a cast of comedic performers to work alongside Coleman and Rogerson. The new format was not successful and in mid-1989 the comedy component was dropped and the emphasis on music (in particular live performances) was re-established. To appeal to a younger demographic two young actors from the Seven Network teen drama \"Home and Away\" were recruited onto the show. Emily Symons and Mat Stevenson co-hosted the new \"Saturday Morning Live\" as well as presenting occasional location reports.\n\nJust as the programme was re-establishing its audience and the ratings were improving the Seven Network suddenly axed \"Saturday Morning Live\" in December 1989.

In addition, paying a cheap price will not guarantee the buyer will receive a product of high quality value. In other words, a low price of a good may indicate that the producer compromised quality.\n\nThe statement is often displayed or published in a one-sentence version: \"There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that person's lawful prey.\" Or simply, \"you get what you pay for.\"\n\nThis statement is also found in this lengthier version: \"There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that person's lawful prey. It's unwise to pay too much, but it's worse to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money – that is all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do. The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot – it can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run, and if you do that you will have enough to pay for something better.\"\n\nThe statement has frequently been attributed to 19th-century art critic and social thinker John Ruskin, although there is little evidence to support Ruskin's authorship.\n\nIn the \"Yale Book of Quotations\", editor Fred R. Shapiro states that this statement was \"Attributed in \"Chicago Daily Tribune\", 29 Jan. 1928. This quotation, repeated in many commercial advertisements, has not been found anywhere in Ruskin's works. An earlier unattributed occurrence appeared in the \"Washington Post\", 1 Nov. 1914: \"There is absolutely nothing in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper; and the people who consider price only are this man's lawful prey.\"\nShapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,\n\nGeorge Landow, a professor of English and art history at Brown University and a specialist on Victorian literature is also skeptical of Ruskin's authorship of this statement.\n\nIn a posting of the \"Ruskin Library News\", a blog associated with the Ruskin Library (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at Lancaster University), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, \"This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin.\" Ruth Hutchison, who maintains the website for the Ruskin Centre at Lancaster University, stated that, \"we have been asked many times about this quote, or similar versions of it, and have never been able to identify it as being by Ruskin. We suspect that it has been wrongly attributed to him in the past and found its way into a book of quotations or something like that.\"\n\nIn an issue of the journal, \"Heat Transfer Engineering\", Bell quotes the statement and mentions that it has been attributed to Ruskin. While Bell believes in the veracity of the content of the statement, he adds that the statement does not appear in Ruskin's published works.\n\nIn the 20th century, this statement appeared—without any authorship attribution—in magazine advertisements, business catalogs, student publications, and, occasionally, in editorial columns.\n\nAlso in the 20th century and continuing into the 21st century, newspaper advertisements, magazine advertisements, trade publications, student publications, business books, technical publications, business catalogs, and other publications often included the statement with attribution to Ruskin.\n\nFor many years, various Baskin Robbins ice cream parlors prominently displayed a section of the statement in framed signs.

As of August 2014, the second generation is sold in South Korea, Russia, China, United States, Canada, Central America, and South America — as well as in the Middle East under the Hyundai Centennial nameplate. \n\nOn November 4, 2015, Hyundai officially announced the Genesis model would be spun off into Genesis Motor, the new luxury vehicle division for Hyundai. The 2016 successor to the Hyundai Equus has been rebranded as Genesis G90 (EQ900 in Korea until 2018). The Equus currently serves as the official state car of the Republic of Korea.\nThe name \"\"equus\"\" is the Latin word for \"horse\".\n\nIn 1999, Hyundai Motors and Mitsubishi Motors presented their full-size sedan. Hyundai said that it was making a full-size sedan to compete with Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series in the Korean market. In reality, it was competing against its domestic rival, the SsangYong Chairman. Hyundai had great success with the Equus in Korea, but very few were exported to other countries. One was exported for the 2001 New York International Auto Show to gauge the reaction of U.S. consumers. Hyundai identified the car to the U.S. consumers as the Hyundai LZ450 luxury sedan but it was not sold in the United States. \n\nThe first generation was designed by Mitsubishi Motors, who had their own version called the Proudia. It was jointly manufactured by both companies. The first-generation model was introduced in 1999 as a front-wheel-drive car measuring long and wide. A long-wheelbase limousine model was available exclusively for the Korean domestic market, and at ₩92,510,000 South Korean won for the 2008 model with a V8 and no options, was the most expensive model in the company's lineup. The first-generation Equus extended-length limousine was also mechanically related to the Mitsubishi Dignity limousine for the Japanese market. The first-generation Equus were sold in South Korea, China, and the Middle East. A very limited number, badged as the Centennial, were made available for some western European markets in the early and mid-2000s. At first, there were two engine types: a 3.5 Sigma V6 and 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine. After a few months, the 3.0 Sigma V6 engine type was added. Two versions were available: a sedan (3.0, 3.5 and 4.5) and a limousine (3.5 and 4.5). In Japan, under the name of Mitsubishi Dignity (limousine version) and Mitsubishi Proudia (sedan version), about 2,000 units were sold. Specifically, the 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine was a GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) type engine, which was designed and developed by Mitsubishi Motors. This engine was optimized for premium unleaded gasoline fuel, but there was little opportunity to get this type of fuel in Korea at that time. So, most of these engines used normal unleaded gasoline fuel and then had significant performance issues, resulting in complaints from drivers. Finally, Hyundai Motors modified this engine from a GDI Type to a MPI (Multi Point Injection) type to solve the issue. It added curtain airbags in 2001 and active head restraints in 2002. \n\nIn 2003, Hyundai presented their 'New Equus', changing the hood design and some of interior. A 7 inch screen for the rear seat, Xenon headlamps, front parking sensors, etc. were newly offered. It introduced seat ventilation cooling and heating, climate control with air purifier (2003), Alcantara leather seats (2007). From 2005, 3.0 and 3.5 Sigma V6 engine types were changed to 3.3 and 3.8 Lambda V6 engine types which were designed and developed by Hyundai Motors. But the automatic transmission was not changed. Hyundai officially ceased the production of 1st generation Equus in November 2009. A new bigger, rear-wheel drive Equus was launched in March 2009. Instead of continuing production like Hyundai, Mitsubishi Motors ended the production of the Proudia and the Dignity around the time of the introduction of this model.\n\nA limousine model was made for the Korean market. Equus Limousines have been used by famous company owners in Korea as well as foreign VIPs.\n\nThe second generation Equus, codename \"VI\", was unveiled in Grand Hyatt Seoul. Unlike the old Equus, the VI has a rear-wheel drive architecture, a longer wheelbase, and a different engine. The VI is based on an all-new platform, developed in-house by the Hyundai Motor Corporation.\n\nThe South Korean domestic market Equus was available as a 3.8L \"Prime\" and a 4.6L \"Prestige.\" It is the most expensive model in the company's lineup. It launched in the People's Republic of China in August 2009. The Hyundai Equus was listed in the '10 exciting cars for 2010' from \"Forbes\".\n\nUS model was announced in 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and was unveiled in 2010 New York Auto Show. Early US model includes the same 4.6L V8 engine as the Genesis except with more than the current version. This puts the total engine output at with . The North American Equus features a badge attached on the hood as opposed to the hood ornament, the grille features a horizontal grid pattern like its Genesis sibling as opposed to the vertical one on international models, and an included iPad device with an Equus user's guide application pre-installed as opposed to a traditional owner's manual.\n\nIt was the first Hyundai with an Electronically-controlled Air Suspension (EAS) and Continuous Damping Control (CDC). Also first Hyundai with Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) collision avoidance system that optimally manages Electronic stability control, the electronic parking brake, radar smart cruise control and the seatbelt tensioning system for optimal safety.\n\nThe long-wheelbase version Equus was unveiled in September 2009. It is longer than the sedan version. Engine choices include Lambda 3.8L and Tau 5.0L engines. The limousine model has an exclusive horizontal cross-bar radiator grille, as well as features such as a power-driven footrest, rear-seat leg support and a massage system.\n\nHyundai also developed an armoured vehicle based on the limousine, with an enlarged 5.5L version of the V8 engine. On September 2009, Hyundai delivered three bulletproof limousine versions of the luxury sedan Equus to the South Korea Presidential Security Service to be used as the official state car. Hyundai designed this vehicle with a special alloy, with an automatic cooling system in case of fire as well as bulletproof windows.\n\nThe first-built armoured limousine was donated to Blue House. A modified Hyundai Equus was donated to Costa Rica and is currently used as the presidential car.\n\nThe limousine was available only in South Korea and Russia. The Russian version had the same price tag as the South Korean version.\n\nIt is a concept vehicle customized by Rhys Millen Racing, based on Equus with 4.6 Tau engine. It included bolt-on RMR Signature Edition air intake and stainless exhaust, increased engine power by 30 hp, RMR Signature Edition embroidered headrests and floor mats, and ostrich hide leather seats with suede accents.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2010 SEMA show.\n\nIt is a version of 2011 Equus sedan built by Mummbles Marketing and DUB Magazine. It included Trex DUB Design mesh grille, DUB Design custom body kit, tinted windows and tail lights, and a custom two-tone, gloss black-and-matte charcoal body colour, DUB Edition custom suspension, 24-inch TIS modular style 10 wheels with Pirelli Pzero Nero Tires, custom trunk enclosure with Infinity Kappa audio (9 Infinity Kappa Series speakers, KAPPA ONE mono and KAPPA FOUR four-channel amplifiers), DUB Design custom leather and suede upholstery, DUB Design illuminated headliner and custom rear bucket seats.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2010 SEMA show.\n\nSouth Korean models include Lambda 3.8 MPi, Tau 4.6 MPi (366PS), Tau 5.0 MPi engines.\n\nUS models include only the Tau 4.6 MPi engine for the 2011 model year (390PS).

To date, the album retains this status. The album was also issued as a limited edition digipak with an exclusive bonus DVD that featured bootleg concert footage along with drum and guitar lessons from members of the band. The album debuted at number 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 during its release.\n\nThe following is a quote from Tom Bejgrowicz, who worked closely with Brain Fair on the overarching themes and concepts portrayed by the album. He also designed the album artwork. \nThe track \"Those Who Cannot Speak\" is dedicated to Brian Fair's autistic niece and nephew. Fair explained in an interview:\n\"The War Within\" received positive reception on its initial release. The album debuted at position no. 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 — the band's highest charting album. Wade Kergan of Allmusic notes that the band has grown beyond the metal-loving hardcore crowd, now having more in common with the classic thrash of Metallica. Michael Gluck of Lambgoat commented that the album \"delivers itself with a fury and honoring of eighties metal guitar and vocal harmonies.\" In 2005, the album was ranked number 370 in \"Rock Hard\" magazine's book of \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\".\n\nThe song \"What Drives the Weak\" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 2006, however the award went to Slipknot for the song \"Before I Forget.\" In a 2009 MetalSucks feature titled \"21 Best Metal Albums of the 21st Century...

She was the consort of Ken Arok, the first ruler of Singhasari, Java, Indonesia. She was later considered the origin of the lineage of kings that rule Java, the great mother of the Rajasa dynasty, the royal family that ruled Java from the Singhasari to the Majapahit era. Local tradition mentioned her as an embodiment of perfect beauty.\n\nMost of the record of her life comes from the account of Pararaton (The Book of Kings), a mixed historical account including supernatural tales and stories. She was the daughter of a Buddhist monk, Mpu Purwa. According to tradition, Ken Dedes' exceptional and extraordinary beauty was famous throughout the land and attracted Tunggul Ametung, the ruler of Tumapel (now the Singhasari district, East Java) who later took her as his wife.\n\nAccording to local tradition, Ken Dedes was kidnapped while her father was away meditating and forced to become Tunggul Ametung's wife. Her father cursed Tunggul Ametung, saying he would be killed because of Ken Dedes' beauty. The curse became reality when Ken Arok assassinated Tunggul Ametung and took Ken Dedes as his own wife.\n\nAccording to Pararaton and local tradition, Ken Arok's usurpation of Tunggul Ametung was caused by Ken Dedes' exceptional beauty and charisma. The story is that Ken Arok was standing close near the royal carriage as it halted and caught a glimpse of the young queen. When her clothes accidentally parted, Ken Arok caught sight of her naked legs and thighs and he saw that her genitals were 'shining'. A Brahmin, Lohgawe, told Ken Arok that this radiance was the sign that Ken Dedes bears the divine quality and would be the bearer of kings. Her beauty was said to have been so perfect that whoever married her, regardless of his status, would inevitably be destined to become king of kings. By this, Ken Arok was motivated to dispatch Tunggul Ametung.\n\nKen Arok later launched a campaign that defeated Kertajaya, King of Kediri and he founded his own kingdom, Singhasari. Ken Dedes became his wife, the first queen of Singhasari. According to local beliefs, the statue of Prajnaparamita, the goddess of transcendental wisdom in Buddhist tradition and found in Cungkup Putri near Singhasari temple, was made in her likeness and probably served as her mortuary deified statue.\n\nAnusapati, Ken Dedes's son from Tunggul Ametung, murdered Ken Arok and became the second ruler of Singhasari.\n"}

Until 1995, the word \"Orion\" was only a model or brand name, not part of the company's name. It was renamed DaimlerChrysler Commercial Buses North America in 2006, but continued to market its products under the Orion name.\n\nThe company had its main manufacturing plant in Mississauga and sent bus body shells to their plant in Oriskany, New York, for final assembly and testing of vehicles destined for U.S. markets. Manufacturing ended in 2013.\n\nThe company was founded in Mississauga in 1975 as Ontario Bus and Truck, Inc., a private company led by Arnold Wollschlaeger. It was renamed Ontario Bus Industries (OBI) in 1977 and introduced its first prototype bus in 1978, under the model name Orion I. Don Sheardown purchased the company from Wollschlaeger's estate in 1979. A U.S. subsidiary named Bus Industries of America, wholly owned by Ontario Bus Industries, was incorporated in 1981 in Oriskany, New York, to serve the U.S. market. Subsequent models built by OBI or BIA continued to use the \"Orion\" brand name, with the Orion II being introduced in 1983 as the first low-floor heavy duty bus and the prototype Orion VI, the company's first low-floor bus, being produced in 1993. \n\nAt its height in the early 1990s, Ontario Bus Industries employed 1,200 at its Mississauga and Oriskany plants, producing 900 buses per year. OBI was taken over by the Ontario Government in 1994 for loan arrears; by that time, the Mississauga plant only had 165 employees. The $81 million investment, which consisted of forgiving $66M in loans and an additional $15M investment, was criticized by Monte Kwinter as \"a total disaster\". It was sold in 1995 to Western Star Truck Holdings of Kelowna for $35M, which also acquired OBI subsidiary Bus Industries of America, and Western Star adopted a new, single name for both companies, Orion Bus Industries. \n\nIn July 2000, parent company Western Star Trucks was acquired by Freightliner, a division of DaimlerChrysler (now Daimler AG), and became part of the group Daimler Buses North America. In 2006, Orion Bus Industries was renamed DaimlerChrysler Commercial Buses North America. It continued to market its buses under the \"Orion\" brand name.\n\nOn April 25, 2012, the company announced it would stop taking orders for new buses, and the Mississauga and Oriskany plants would close once outstanding orders were fulfilled. The closure took union officials by surprise; CAW had just signed a one-year extension on April 1 for the Mississauga plant. It was announced that more than 530 workers will be laid off in the Mississauga and Oriskany plants. The Mississauga workers staged a wildcat work stoppage to protest in employee frustration at the slow pace of winding-down talks. New Flyer assumed some outstanding orders with Orion for New York City Transit and King County Metro.\n\nThe Oriskany plant was initially retained for aftermarket parts and support for Orion bus operators, until New Flyer acquired that business from Daimler Buses in 2013. The New York location also performed repairs, including a retrofit program with BAE Systems for recalled hybrid-electric buses using BAE's HybriDrive system, until it was refitted as an assembly facility for New Flyer buses.\n\nThe sales and closures were part of the closure of Daimler Buses North America; only Daimler's imported Setra buses continued to be marketed in North America although distribution rights were taken over by Motor Coach Industries (MCI) in exchange for a minority stake in MCI. MCI itself was purchased by New Flyer in 2015, and the Setra distribution rights lasted until January 2018, when the REV Group took over distribution.\n\nOrion manufactured a number of different models of buses over its 37-year existence. A list of models is given below; each increasing number is the next generation model.\n\nMost buses today in service are of the Orion V or VII models. Orion also marketed the Thomas Dennis SLF 200 mid-sized bus.\n\n\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Miami and was drafted by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft, and spent the first 11 years of his career there. By the late 2000s, Wilfork was considered to be one of the premier defensive tackles in the NFL, and was named both to the Pro Bowl and the All-Pro team in , , , and . He also played two seasons for the Houston Texans before retiring following the 2016 season.\n\nWilfork was born in Boynton Beach, Florida, and attended Santaluces Community High School in Palm Beach County, Florida. There, he was a letter winner in football, wrestling, and track and field. In football, he won \"USA Today\"'s second team All-American honors.\n\nIn track & field, Wilfork was one of the nation's top performers in the throwing events. He was the Florida Class 4A state champion in the shot put and the discus in 2000. He also holds the Florida state high school record in the shot put with a throw of 68 feet (20.73 m). In the discus event, his top throw was 180 feet (54.86 m).\n\nWilfork attended the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team. He also competed for the Miami Hurricanes track and field team; he held the Miami indoor school record in the shot put until Isaiah Simmons surpassed it in 2013. In his freshman season, Wilfork did not start but played in every game as a defensive tackle, finishing tenth on the team in tackles with 41 while also recording a sack and forcing three fumbles. Wilfork did not start a game in his 2002 sophomore season either, but still recorded 43 tackles and seven sacks. Before the 2003 season, Wilfork was rated the second best defensive tackle in the country by \"The Sporting News\" and went on to start all 13 games for Miami. He finished the year with a career-high 64 tackles and led the team with 20 quarterback hurries. He was named to the All-Big East Conference first-team following the season, which would prove to be his last in Miami as he decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 2004 NFL Draft.\n\nWilfork was ranked as the No. 2 defensive tackle going into the 2004 NFL Draft, behind only Tommie Harris. Although regarded as a top-10 talent, Wilfork was criticized for lackadaisical effort during his junior season, basically playing \"not to get hurt.\" Wilfork drew comparisons to fellow Miami alumnus Warren Sapp, and was projected a mid-first round pick. The Patriots drafted Wilfork with the 21st overall pick. He was the highest selected Miami Hurricane defensive tackle since Damione Lewis in 2001.\n\nIn his rookie 2004 season with the Patriots, he compiled two sacks, 42 tackles, and three deflected passes. Wilfork saw considerable playing time during his rookie season, sharing the nose tackle position with veteran Keith Traylor and started Super Bowl XXXIX against the Philadelphia Eagles, a Patriots victory.\n\nFollowing Traylor's release, Wilfork had a career-high 54 tackles in 2005 and started all 16 games; however, the defending champions were eliminated in the second round of playoffs by the Denver Broncos. In 2006, Wilfork finished the season with 50 tackles, appearing in 13 games.\n\nIn the 2007 season, Wilfork finished the season with 48 tackles and two sacks, was selected to the 2008 Pro Bowl, and was named as a second-team All-Pro selection.\n\nWilfork was fined a total of four times by the NFL in the 2007 season. In the third game of the season he was fined $12,500 by the NFL for his hit on Buffalo Bills quarterback J. P. Losman. This was appealed to the NFL and reduced to $2,500. In an October 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Wilfork was fined $5,000 for drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct foul when he tangled with Cowboys tight end Jason Witten. In the last game of the regular 2007 season, Wilfork placed his finger in the facemask of New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs after a play in the second quarter. He was fined $15,000. He was also fined $5,000 for a 15-yard face-mask penalty called in the against the San Diego Chargers, while attempting to tackle running back Michael Turner.\n\nWilfork's string of fines continued into the 2008 season, when in an October 20 game against the Denver Broncos Wilfork appeared to elbow Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler in the head after a play. Wilfork met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in the days following the game and reportedly faced a one-game suspension, but after Wilfork explained his manner of playing to Goodell only a fine was imposed. Wilfork finished the 2008 season with a career-high 66 tackles, while recording two sacks. In 2008, he was also named for the first time a defensive captain, by his teammates.\n\nWilfork entered the final season of his contract in 2009. Reportedly unhappy with not receiving a contract extension, Wilfork did not attend the team's voluntary organized team activities in the spring, but reported to the team's mandatory sessions later in the summer. In August 2009, he was named to the Patriots' 50th anniversary team. Wilfork would go on to start the first 13 games of the season for the Patriots, missing the final three games of the season with an ankle injury before returning for the Patriots' playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the season with 43 tackles and no sacks, and he was elected to the 2010 Pro Bowl.\n\nWilfork's contract expired after the 2009 season. He stated that he was looking for a long-term deal and threatened with a holdout should the Patriots instead place a franchise tag on him. In an interview with the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" he also acknowledged it would be \"a dream come true\" to play for either the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or the Miami Dolphins. On February 22, Wilfork was assigned the non-exclusive version of the franchise tag by the Patriots, who expressed their desire to reach a long-term contract with Wilfork. On March 5, the first day of free agency, the Patriots re-signed Wilfork to a five-year, $40 million contract with $25 million in guaranteed money.\n\nAfter starting the first three games of the 2010 season at nose tackle, Wilfork moved to defensive end beginning in Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins. He returned to start at nose tackle in the Patriots' Week 8 win over the Minnesota Vikings. He would continue to switch between the positions for the remainder of the season, but started all 16 games and finished with 57 tackles and two sacks. Wilfork was selected to the 2011 Pro Bowl after the season. Wilfork was named to the 2010 AP All-Pro Second Team at defensive tackle, finishing third in the voting, but also received a vote at defensive end.\n\nAt the start of the 2011 NFL Season, he played defensive tackle when the New England Patriots moved to a 4–3 defense thanks to his former teammate Albert Haynesworth and after playing nose tackle for the first seven NFL seasons. In the second game of the 2011 season, Wilfork got his first career interception off San Diego Chargers quarterback, Philip Rivers. He caught his second interception against the Oakland Raiders two weeks later. He scored a touchdown on week 14 against the Washington Redskins at the FedExField.\n\nDuring the 2011 season, Wilfork recorded 3.5 sacks—a new career high—and was included on the AFC's 2012 Pro Bowl roster. In the AFC Championship game against the Ravens, he had one of his best games of his career, recording 1.5 sacks and 6 tackles. At the end of the 2011 season, Wilfork and the Patriots appeared in Super Bowl XLVI. He started in the game and recorded three total tackles, but the Patriots lost to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.\n\nWilfork was selected as a defensive tackle for USA Football's 2012 \"All Fundamentals Team\", which honors 26 NFL players each year for executing the fundamentals of their position. He was also named to his fourth career Pro Bowl team and to the All Pro second team.\n\nIn 2012, he was voted co-captain for the fifth straight season by his teammates. He finished the year with 48 total tackles and 3 sacks. His strong season earned him a spot in the Associated Press All Pro first team and in the 2013 Pro Bowl.\n\nIn week 4 of the 2013 NFL season against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilfork tore his right Achilles' tendon while trying to get past Falcons offensive guard Justin Blalock. Wilfork would miss the rest of the 2013 season after being placed on injured reserve.\n\nIn March 2014, Wilfork re-signed to a three-year $22.5 million deal.\n\nIn the 2014 NFL season, Wilfork recorded 47 tackles, 2 passes defensed, and 1 interception. He helped the Patriots reach Super Bowl XLIX. In the Super Bowl, Wilfork recorded 2 tackles as they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24 to give Wilfork his second Super Bowl championship.\n\nOn March 5, 2015, the Patriots declined their team option on Wilfork's contract, which made him a free agent at the end of the 2014 league season.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, Wilfork signed a two-year deal with the Houston Texans. He started all 16 games in 2015 at the nose tackle position making 22 tackles. In his two seasons in Houston, he totaled 43 tackles, helping the Texans win back-to-back AFC South titles.\n\nOn August 9, 2017, Wilfork held a press conference to announce his retirement, along with signing a one-day contract to retire with the Patriots.\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Patriots honored Wilfork by naming him honorary captain for the AFC Championship game and he presented the Lamar Hunt Trophy after the Patriots beat Kansas City Chiefs. After the Super Bowl LIII win, Wilfork carried the Lombardi Trophy along with Emmitt Smith and Joe Namath to the presentation stage.\n\nWilfork lives in Houston, Texas, with his wife Bianca and their three children (two sons and one daughter). Both of Wilfork's parents died in 2002 and were unable to see him play in the NFL.\n\nFollowing the Patriots' victory in the 2014 AFC Championship game, Wilfork helped remove a driver out from an overturned vehicle. He noticed the flipped SUV on his way home from Gillette Stadium, assisting an officer already at the scene. Wilfork later recounted the event and his role in helping the driver: \"I think anybody would do the same thing, I saw the lady in there and asked her if she was OK, could she move. She grabbed my hand, and kind of talked her through [it]. It wasn't a big deal; it was seeing someone that needed help and helping. I was just trying to get her to safety.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1811116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811116", "title": "Rookie of the Year (film)", "text": "Rookie of the Year (film)\n\nRookie of the Year is a 1993 American sports comedy film starring Thomas Ian Nicholas and Gary Busey as players for the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The cast also includes Albert Hall, Dan Hedaya, Eddie Bracken, Amy Morton, Bruce Altman, John Gegenhuber, Neil Flynn, Daniel Stern (who also directed), and John Candy in an uncredited role.\n\nHenry Rowengartner, an unskilled Little Leaguer who dreams of playing in the major leagues, breaks his arm catching a fly ball. When the doctor removes the cast, he discovers Henry's tendons have healed \"a little too tight\", enabling Henry to pitch with incredible force.\n\nAt Wrigley Field during a Chicago Cubs game, Henry's friends get a home run ball hit by the visiting Montreal Expos. Returning the ball to the field, Henry throws so hard that it reaches home plate, 435 feet away. Desperate to save the club from declining attendance, general manager Larry Fisher looks to recruit Henry. Manager Sal Martinella visits Henry at home with a radar gun, and discovers that Henry can pitch at over 100 MPH. For the remainder of the season, Henry juggles the culture shock of playing in the major leagues alongside one of his heroes, aging pitcher Chet \"Rocket\" Steadman, and socializing. Henry's mother, Mary, tries to keep him grounded while resisting attempts by her boyfriend, Jack, and Fisher to exploit him.\n\nHenry's first game is a relief appearance against the New York Mets, where his first pitch gives up a home run to the Mets' arrogant slugger Heddo, but he manages to get his first save. Despite wanting to quit, Henry improves under Steadman’s tutoring and records a second consecutive save against the San Francisco Giants, and his first MLB strikeout.\n\nContinuing to impress, Henry bats for the first time in a road game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He frustrates the pitcher with his small stature and tiny strike zone, to the point that he walks Henry on four straight high pitches. He further taunts the pitcher at first and second base, and the pitcher retaliates by hitting the next batter, but Henry scores a run.\n\nThe Cubs are winning, and Henry is growing in pitching success and fame. His personal life becomes strained as his friends grow jealous, and Mary breaks up with Jack when he tricks her into signing a contract to join the New York Yankees. Henry resolves the conflict with his friends, and team owner Bob Carson explains he never authorized a deal with the Yankees and wants to retain Henry. Disappointed that Henry will retire at the end of the season, Carson respects Henry's decision, and demotes Fisher to Hot Dog Salesman after learning he tried to set up the deal.\n\nOn the last day of the season, the Cubs face the Mets again at Wrigley Field, with Steadman starting. If the Cubs triumph, they win the division title and move on to the World Series. Steadman finds \"The Rocket\" and pitches well, but injures his arm tagging a runner out at home. He turns the ball over to Henry, who easily strikes out the side in the seventh and eighth innings. At the top of the ninth, Henry slips on a baseball, reversing the effects of his first fall and reducing his arm strength to normal.\n\nHenry frustrates the Cubs and their fans by intentionally walking the other team. He explains to his teammates why he can no longer throw fastballs, and sends them back to their positions with a plan. With their cooperation, Henry sneaks the ball to the first baseman, who tags the runner out. Henry walks the next batter, with whom he trades insults. When the runner dares him to throw the ball high, Henry does so but stops as the runner takes off for second and is tagged out, setting up a final showdown with Heddo. Henry throws a changeup, which Heddo misses, and his next hit is ruled a foul ball. Henry opens his glove to find not his father's name, but Mary's. In the stands, she signals him to throw a floater. He does so and strikes out a shocked Heddo, winning the division title for the Cubs.\n\nThe next spring, Henry plays Little League again with Mary and Steadman as his team's coaches. After catching a home run ball that ensures his team's victory, Henry raises his fist to reveal a Cubs World Series championship ring, signifying his role in the Cubs' World Series victory.\n\n\nFilming took place on location at, among other venues, Wrigley Field (including in between games of a doubleheader on September 19, 1992, between the Cubs and the rival St. Louis Cardinals) and O'Hare Airport. However, the road game against the Dodgers was filmed at Comiskey Park.\n\nThe film has received a 35% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 20 critics.\n\nRoger Ebert awarded the film three out of four stars, writing in his review: \n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" dismissed the film as a \"a lighter-than-air movie fantasy of major-league stardom\" with a \"paint-by-the-numbers plot\", while Michael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" opined, \n\nThe film was a box office success, grossing $9.2 million on 1,460 screens on its opening weekend It dropped to seventh place the following week, and by its third weekend was in eighth place behind the films \"Poetic Justice\" and six other films. It ultimately made $56.5 million on a budget of $31 million.\n\nFollowing the film's release, Nicholas threw out the first pitch at Cubs games and was invited to sing \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" multiple times during the customary 7th-inning stretch. During the 2015 National League Championship Series where the Cubs faced the Mets as they did in the movie, he attended Game 4 in a Rowengartner #1 jersey similar to what he wore during the film.\n\nFollowing the Cubs' win over the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series to win their first championship since 1908, Nicholas, in celebration, tweeted the final shot from the movie of Henry showing his Cubs World Series ring. Furthermore, director Daniel Stern briefly reprised his role of Brickma following the win.\n\n"}

Full name was: \"Zakłady Mechaniczne E. Plage i T. Laśkiewicz\" – Mechanical Works E. Plage & T. Laśkiewicz. The factory produced aircraft between 1920 and 1935, when it was nationalized as the LWS.\n\nPlage i Laśkiewicz first was a mechanical workshop and steam boiler producer, but in 1920 it started producing aircraft, as the first works in independent Poland. On February 17, 1920, the Polish government ordered a licence production of Italian fighters Ansaldo A.1 Balilla and light bombers Ansaldo A.300 in Plage & Laśkiewicz. The first Polish A.300 was flown on June 14, 1921. However, due to lack of experience, a quality of produced aircraft was low, and there were numerous crashes. As a result, the order was limited to 70 A.300 and 50 A.1 only, produced by 1924.\n\nDespite its unsuccessful beginning the factory gained experience, and there were no major problems with future aircraft series. In 1924, the Polish government ordered a licence production of French light bombers Potez XV, and in 1925–1926, there were built 100 of them in Plage & Laśkiewicz. In 1928–1931 the works produced 150 of more modern Potez 25. In 1929–1930 the works produced 11 passenger planes Fokker F-VIIb/3m on Fokker licence, and 20 of own Fokker F-VIIb/3m bomber modification.\n\nIn the mid-1920s the factory management was changed, and the main designer became Jerzy Rudlicki. Then, apart from licence production, the works started to produce own aircraft, under Lublin name, designated \"R\" for Rudlicki.\n\nThe first own design was a biplane bomber Lublin R-VIII, flown in 1928. Six were produced by 1930, three of them were later converted to seaplanes and used in the Polish naval aviation until 1939. Prototype light passenger planes: biplane R-IX, and high-wing R-XI were not ordered by the Polish Airlines. Also sport high-wing plane Lublin R-XII was not produced in series.\nAnother design was a parasol wing liaison aircraft Lublin R-X, flown in 1929. It won a contest for a Polish Air Force liaison plane, but only 7 were produced. Instead, Rudlicki developed it further and designed trainer aircraft R-XIV and an army cooperation plane Lublin R-XIII, which became Polish main army cooperation plane (and the only mass-produced Lublin). 15 of R-XIV were built in 1930–31, and 223 of R-XIII were built in 1932–1935 (further 50 after nationalization). Its experimental variant R-XIX introduced the V-tail, invented by Rudlicki.\n\nThe light passenger plane Lublin R-XVI of 1932 was not ordered by the airlines, but 6 were produced as air ambulance R-XVIb. The last construction was a two-engine torpedo seaplane Lublin R-XX, flown in 1935, but it was not produced as well. Apart from these, some other designs did not reach prototype stage.\n\nIn 1924–1933 the works produced also car bodies, mainly for Somua (imported) and Ursus buses, but also for luxury imported cars and the Ralf-Stetysz cars.\n\nDue to plans of Polish aviation authorities (mainly Ludomił Rayski) to gather all aviation industry in state-owned factories, Plage & Laśkiewicz works were forced to bankruptcy. After delivering 7 of ordered 50 R-XIIIF aircraft in late 1935, the Polish Ministry of War broke the contract under a pretext. As a result, the factory went bankrupt and then was nationalized under the name LWS (\"Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów\" – Lublin Aircraft Works). Then, 18 almost ready R-XIIIF, bought by scrap price, were completed, and the next series of 32 was built.\n\n"}

Housing developments are slowly continuing in the north east and south west quadrants. The downtown area is centred at Centre Street and Main Street. The town itself is bordered on the west by Highway 48, which connects Markham and Beaverton and on the east by Durham Regional road 30, which serves as a townline between East Gwillimbury and Uxbridge. The Mount Albert Creek passes through Mount Albert. The outlying area is forested mainly by private woodlots and some regionally owned and maintained pine forests while farmlands are found throughout the area. The major industry is farming (livestock, feed, and potatoes).\n\n\n\nThe establishment of what is now Mount Albert began in the early 19th century, when land in the area was granted by the Crown to friends of the Family Compact, the governing council of Upper Canada. In 1821, Samuel and Rufus Birchard, Quakers from Vermont, bought parcels of land, and by 1850, a village had developed. Originally, the settlement was called Birchardville. The name was later changed to Mount Albert, named after then Prince Albert, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in honour of his visit to Upper Canada in 1860. Industries were primarily agricultural, with grist, flour, woollen and lumber mills located along the Mount Albert Creek. The first known store was built in 1850 to supply dry goods to the villagers and surrounding farmers. The main north-south road in the village, Centre Street, was built along the path of an Algonquin Indian trail.\n\nHousing developments slowly expanded the original village in the mid-to-late 20th century, beginning in the 1970s in the south and east quadrants. More development began in the late 1990s expanding to lands north west of the heart of Mount Albert. This subdivision was first established in 1995, with the third phase still under construction as of 2016 in the north east. A smaller development began in the south west in 2009.\n\nChildren were originally schooled in two local Grammar Schools, one to the north, and one south of the village.\nA public school opened in 1890 on Centre Street, and served the surrounding community until 1968. The Ross Family Complex now stands on the former school grounds. A continuation school was constructed in 1926 and taught public school graduates until 1948 when students were bused to Newmarket High School.\nMount Albert Public School opened in 1967, housing Kindergarten to Grade 8. Robert Munsch Public School opened in September 2014, and services JK to grade 3, while Mount Albert Public School continues with grades 4 to 8.

Built by convicts between 1825 and 1836, it traverses over of the rugged terrain that hindered early agricultural expansion.\n\nThe road is of such cultural significance it was included on the Australian National Heritage List on 1 August 2007 as a \"nationally significant example of major public infrastructure developed using convict labour\" and on the UNESCO World Heritage list as amongst:\n\n\" .. the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.\"\n\nThe road was an engineering triumph, with some sections constructed to a notably high standard. Unfortunately, it was not an unqualified success in practical terms. Apart from the steep grades, there was a lack of water and horse feed along the route. For these reasons it quickly fell into disuse with the development of alternative means of getting to the Hunter Valley, such as steamships and newer roads. Much of the road fell into total disuse while other parts were absorbed into the urban and rural road network.\n\nThe Great North Road commences at Parramatta Road, at what is now the Sydney suburb of Five Dock. After crossing the Parramatta River at Abbotsford, at the time by boat, it passed through Ryde and Dural before reaching the Hawkesbury River at Wisemans Ferry, to the north. It then winds through isolated and often rugged bushland along the edge of Dharug National Park, continuing through Bucketty until forking at Wollombi. From there one branch continues to Warkworth via Broke and the other goes to Cessnock, Maitland and on to Newcastle.\n\nThe Great North Road survives to this day, but different parts are preserved in very different ways. Much of it is under bitumen and concrete, either as suburban streets or rural backroads, while some is preserved in national parks and protected from vehicular traffic.\n\nSlight evidence of its past, such as bypassed bridgeworks or even convict rock carvings, survives within the Sydney metropolitan area; by contrast large stretches remain in original condition north of the Hawkesbury River.\n\nThe first few kilometres, from Five Dock to the Parramatta River (at Abbotsford), pass through a local shopping strip and suburban area. The historic name is retained for this section, the only reason anyone would think twice about this unremarkable piece of suburban road.\nThe road then recommences at the Baulkham Hills intersection with Windsor Road.\nKnown as Old Northern Road, and Tourist Drive 15, it winds up past the suburbs of Castle Hill, Glenhaven, Dural, before continuing north as a two-lane undivided road. Old Northern Road terminates at Wiseman's Ferry.\nAt Bucketty, it is once again renamed the Great North Road.\n\nTwo sections of the original route: the Devine's Hill (Wisemans Ferry) to Mount Manning section and the Mount Manning to Wollombi section are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.\n\nIn 1990, the local communities of Bucketty and Wollombi established the 'Convict Trail Project', aiming to restore, maintain and promote the road as a museum of convict engineering. Original sections of the road which are on view have provided valuable insight into early road construction techniques in the colony of New South Wales, and how English road-building technology of the time was imported and adapted. Prisoners from facilities managed by Corrective Services NSW have been involved with maintenance.\n\nIn July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Great North Road and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the Australian Convict Sites. The listing explains that the 11 sites present \"the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts\". Of the 11 sites the Hyde Park Barracks, Cockatoo Island, Old Government House at Parramatta are also within the Sydney region.\n\nAs part of the works to bring about public engagement with the UNESCO World Heritage Listed 'Old Great North Road' that is managed by the New South Wales National Parks & Wildlife Service, a 'living history' theatre production was commissioned to tell some of the stories in-situ on Devine's Hill in Dharug National Park, Wiseman's Ferry, along the living remnants of The Road itself. 'Convict Footprints on the Old Great North Road' is a heart-touching, at times funny, at times deeply sad journey with the men and women that built The Road along the very cobbles they themselves walked.\n\nThe road is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\n\n\n"}

Engineer Mike Roche, who recorded Thought Industry's \"Black Umbrella\" and Fred Thompson Trio's \"Scary Halloween Sound Effects\" and filled in on bass from time to time, was added as a full-time guitarist along with drummer Cameron Taylor, bassist Mark Baldwin and guitarist Jeff Borkowski.\n\nChristopher Lee Simmonds continued to perform as a singer/songwriter in the Chicago area through 1996. Simultaneously recording with Filter on 1997's \"Title of Record\" and recording and producing the debut album by local band MiLkBabY for his label Moonquake Mobile. Simmonds also recorded two solo albums, toured the mid-west and east coast through late 2007 and re-located to Baltimore, Maryland, that September. There Simmonds established himself as a studio engineer and producer of many projects. Most notable would be Good Charlotte, Jimmie's Chicken Shack, Marcy Playground, Underfoot, Filter, Gods & Aliens, Bullhead and most of the local scene. Simonds continued with his progressive metal nature and created what most consider to be the continuation of Thought Industry, Bullhead. Bullhead is a culmination of the most extreme of Simmonds' work.\n\nSimmonds went on to perform with The Static Dynamic, based out of Boston, Massachusetts. The band released a ten-song, self-titled CD distributed by Tunecore through iTunes and Rhapsody. Simmonds continues to perform as a solo singer/songwriter in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia on a regular basis. As a singer for Cosmonaut, Oberlin released \"Pipebomb Full of Nails\" in 2004. Cosmonaut's debut release was released on Swollen Lip Records.\n\nOn July 18 and 19 2014, a Thought Industry reunion with a line-up of Brent Oberlin, Paul Enzio, Herb Ledbetter, Mike Roche and Jared Bryant took place at Shakespeare's Pub and at Louie's Trophy House Grill respectively, in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811210", "title": "Badge (song)", "text": "Badge (song)\n\n\"Badge\" is a song performed by British rock music group Cream. It was written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison, and was included as a track on Cream's final album, \"Goodbye\". Also issued as a single in March 1969, \"Badge\" peaked at number 18 in the United Kingdom and number 60 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"Badge\" was originally an untitled track. During the production transfer for the album \"Goodbye\", the original music sheet was used to produce the liner notes and track listing. The only discernible word on the page was \"bridge\" (indicating the song's bridge section). Due to Harrison's handwriting, however, Clapton misread it as \"badge\"—and the song was titled soon thereafter.\n\nHarrison remembered the story thus:\nCommon legends or misconceptions are that the name came about because its chord progression was B–A–D–G–E (which is not true) or simply because the notation of a guitar's standard tuning (E–A–D–G–B–E) can be arranged to spell \"Badge\".\n\nIn the US, Atco Records' initial releases of \"Goodbye\" and of \"Badge\" as a single gave the song's writing credit to Eric Clapton alone, with publishing credit to Robert Stigwood's company Casserole (BMI). Atco later corrected in 1969 with the release of \"Best of Cream\", which lists both Clapton and George Harrison as the song's authors. The UK single of \"Badge\" released by Polydor Records gave writing credit to both Clapton and Harrison, with publishing credit going to Dratleaf and Harrisongs Ltd. Since the early 1990s the writing credit has been listed as Clapton/Harrison with publishing credit going to E.C. Music, Ltd. and Harrisongs. Despite his alleged contribution to the song's lyrics, Ringo Starr is not credited as a co-author of \"Badge\".\n\n"}

It took areas previously within the Cheadle constituency.\n\nThe constituency was established in time for the February 1974 general election, having previously formed part of the Cheadle constituency. At that election, the seat was won by Michael Winstanley of the Liberal Party, who had been the MP for Cheadle between 1966 and 1970. Winstanley only held it for a few months because, at the general election in October 1974, he lost to the Conservatives' Tom Arnold.\n\nArnold held the seat until 1997, although (with the exception of the 1979 election) this was with small majorities over the local Liberals/SDP-Liberal Alliance/Liberal Democrats' candidate. At the 1997 general election, Arnold stood down and the seat was taken by Andrew Stunell of the Liberal Democrats. Stunell held the seat until his retirement in 2015, although with reduced majorities.\n\nThe Conservative share of the vote fell in Hazel Grove in both the 2001 and 2005 general elections, from a (winning) peak under Tom Arnold of 44.8% in 1992 to a low of 29.7% in 2005. Following three failed attempts to increase the share of the vote (1997, 2001 and 2005), this decline was reversed in the 2010 election by Annesley Abercorn, who achieved a 33.6% share of the vote (+3.9%) and a 2.4% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives.\n\nMajor boundary changes occurred at this election. The vote changes compare with estimates for the 1979 election on the same boundaries.\n\n\n\n"}

Much of the constituency is commuter territory for Manchester.\n\nMacclesfield was first represented in Parliament after the Reform Act of 1832, from when it had two members of Parliament. This situation lasted until 1880, when after problems at the general election that year it was decided to declare the election void and suspend the writ of election (so no by-election could take place).\n\nIn September 1880 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate further. A report of March 1881 confirmed the allegations of corruption. As a result, the borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. The disenfranchisement took effect on 25 June 1885, when the town was transferred to the East Cheshire constituency.\n\nHowever under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the Macclesfield constituency was recreated with extended boundaries, as a county division, later in 1885. From the 1885 general election it has elected one MP.\n\nMacclesfield had long been considered to be a safe seat for the Conservative Party, having been held by them since the 1918 general election. Macclesfield itself is evenly split in terms of councillors between the Conservatives and Labour, but the smaller towns and rural villages like Prestbury, Gawsworth and Poynton that make up the bulk of the seat vote primarily for the Conservative Party. After the 2017 general election, however, the constituency is now a target seat for Labour, after they achieved a 7% swing in that election.\n\nIn the 2019 local elections, the Conservatives lost every councillor they had in the town of Macclesfield, with Labour making significant gains in areas they had never won before. The Conservatives largely maintained their vote in the villages outside Macclesfield, with the possible exceptions of Bollington and Disley, in which they came third behind Labour and Independent candidates.\n\nDuring the 2016 EU membership referendum, the constituency voted narrowly to remain in the EU, despite the UK overall voting to leave. Around 7,000 Maxonians subsequently signed a petition calling for a second referendum although it is estimated that 47% of the Macclesfield electorate voted to leave.\n\nSir Nicholas Winterton who had been the Conservative MP, was first elected at a by-election in 1971 and held the seat until his retirement as an MP on the dissolution of the House of Commons in April 2010. Both Sir Nicholas and his wife Ann, Conservative MP for Congleton from 1983 to 2010, announced that they would not be candidates at the general election. On 17 October 2009 David Rutley was selected as the Conservative candidate by way of an open primary organised by the party and on 6 May 2010 was elected MP with an increased majority.\n\nFrom 1832 until 1880, Macclesfield was represented by two members of parliament.\n\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1940.

{"id": "1811223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811223", "title": "1981–82 NFL playoffs", "text": "1981–82 NFL playoffs\n\nThe National Football League playoffs for the 1981 season began on December 27, 1981. The postseason tournament concluded with the San Francisco 49ers defeating the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI, 26–21, on January 24, 1982, at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.\n\nBoth conference champions had losing records the previous season, the only time this has happened. All four AFC playoff games were between teams who had never faced each other in the postseason before. This was the only time this happened in either conference since the playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978.\n\nThis was also the first year that both New York City area teams, the Giants and the Jets, made the playoffs together in the same year. The Giants qualified for the first time since 1963, and the Jets for the first time since 1969.\n\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl XVI.\n\nThis was last season that local times were considered in scheduling afternoon playoff games for the first three rounds, and not strictly in the 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST time slots.\n\nBills defensive back Bill Simpson's interception at the Buffalo 1-yard line with two seconds left in the game preserved a 31–27 victory and gave Buffalo their first playoff win since 1965. This would also turn out to be the final NFL playoff game at Shea Stadium, as the Jets moved to Giants Stadium three years later.\n\nThe Bills jumped to a 24–0 lead by the second quarter against a Jets defense that had only given up 37 first quarter points all season. First New York's Bruce Harper fumbled the opening kickoff while being tackled by Ervin Parker, and Charles Romes returned the ball 26-yards to the end zone. After a few punts, New York had a great chance to respond when Richard Todd completed a 37-yard pass to tight end Jerome Barkum on the Bills 30-yard line. On the next play, receiver Wesley Walker broke open in the end zone and Todd threw him the ball, only to watch it go right through Walker's hands. The next two plays resulted in the team being pushed back to the 35, where Pat Leahy missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. Then Buffalo drove 66 yards in three plays to score on quarterback Joe Ferguson's 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Frank Lewis. On the Jets next drive, defensive back Rufus Bess intercepted a pass from Todd and returned it 49 yards to the New York 12, leading to a 29-yard field goal by Nick Mike-Mayer.\n\nNow down 17-0, New York had a good chance to get back in the game when Mark Gastineau forced a fumble from Ferguson on the Bills next drive. Gastineau got to the ball before anyone else, but wound up accidentally knocking the ball forward twice while trying to pick it up, and Buffalo lineman Ken Jones ended up recovering it. Following a missed 37-yard field goal attempt by Mike-Mayer after the fumble recovery, Todd led the Jets to the Bills 38-yard line, only to throw another interception, this one to linebacker Phil Villapiano, who returned it 18 yards to the 40. The Bills converted this turnover into a 24-0 lead as Ferguson completed a 28-yard pass to running back Joe Cribbs before hooking up with Lewis for a 26-yard scoring completion. However, New York got a big boost from receiver Kurt Sohn, who returned the kickoff 28 yards to the 48-yard line. From there, Todd led the team 52 yards in five plays to score on his 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mickey Shuler, Shuler's first reception of the season. After a pair of punts, Jets linebacker Greg Buttle returned an interception from Ferguson 29 yards to the Bills 14-yard line, setting up's Leahy's 26-yard field goal that cut the score to 24-10 at the end of the half.\n\nButtle intercepted another pass from Ferguson on the opening drive of the third quarter, returning this one 11 yards to the Bills 44. The Jets took advantage again with another Leahy field goal to bring the team within 11 points at 24-13. Then Ferguson threw his third consecutive interception on the next drive, which Donald Dykes picked off and returned 22 yards, giving New York a first down on the Buffalo 35. But this time the Jets could not take advantage, as Simpson put an end to the next drive with an interception of his own.\n\nThe Bills next drive resulted in Ferguson's 4th consecutive interception, this one thrown to Jerry Holmes, but the Jets were forced to punt, and Lou Piccone returned Chuck Ramsey's 29-yard punt 5 yards to the New York 45-yard line. Then with just over 10 minutes left in the game, Cribbs ran for a 45-yard touchdown, increasing the Bills lead to 31–13. Todd then led the Jets 80 yards in eight plays and completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to Bobby Jones. Then after forcing a punt that Harper returned 6 yards to his own 42, New York drove for another score, aided by a pass interference call against Bills defensive back Mario Clark that nullified an interception. Kevin Long finished the 58-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to cut the score to 31–27. The Jets got the ball back with 2:36 remaining and then drove 69 yards to the Buffalo 11-yard line, aided by a holding penalty that wiped out an interception by defensive back Steve Freeman. Todd also made several key completions, including a 29-yarder to Shuler and a 26-yard pass to Derrick Gaffney on third and 20. However, Simpson's interception at the 1-yard line halted New York's comeback with two seconds left.\n\nSimpson recorded two interceptions, while Lewis caught seven passes for a franchise postseason record 158 yards and two touchdowns. Shuler caught six passes for 116 yards and a touchdown. Todd threw for 377 yards, while Ferguson threw for 268. Both quarterbacks threw two touchdowns and were intercepted four times. Simpson and Buttle each had two interceptions. Cribbs rushed for 83 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 4 passes for 64 yards.\n\nDespite playing without starting quarterback Phil Simms and linebacker Brad Van Pelt, the Giants jumped to a 20–0 lead in the first quarter and withstood an Eagles comeback at the end to hold on to a 27–21 win.\n\nIn the first quarter, Eagles kick/punt returner Wally Henry fumbled a punt due to a hit from Lawrence Taylor and Beasley Reece recovered the ball for the Giants at the Philadelphia 26-yard line. A few plays later, quarterback Scott Brunner then threw a 9-yard touchdown to running back Leon Bright (the extra point attempt failed). Then after forcing a punt, the Giants drove 74 yards, including an 11-yard scramble by Brunner on 3rd and 11, to score on his 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Mistler. Henry muffed the ensuing kickoff, and as he tried to pick it up, he lost the ball while being hit by Mike Dennis. Giants defensive back Mark Haynes recovered the ball in the end zone to give New York a 20–0 lead. After the ensuing kickoff, the first quarter ended with Giants having a 104 to 1 advantage over Philadelphia in total yards gained.\n\nIn the second quarter, New York had a chance to increase their lead with a drive into Eagles territory, but Philadelphia's defense dug in and stuffed Brunner for no gain on a 4th and 1 conversion attempt on the 35. Later on, Herman Edwards' interception of a Brunner pass gave the Eagles a first down on the New York 36-yard line, which they converted to a 20-7 score with quarterback Ron Jaworski's 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Harold Carmichael. However, Reece returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 38-yard line, where the Giants proceeded to drive 62 yards in 5 plays to score on Brunner's 22-yard touchdown pass to Tom Mullady, giving them a 27–7 halftime lead. The key play of the drive was a 21-yard run by Rob Carpenter on 2nd and 8 from the 40 with 2:04 left on the clock.\n\nNew York was shut out in the second half, while the Eagles opened the third quarter by marching 82 yards in 15 plays on a drive that consumed 7:58 and ended on running back Wilbert Montgomery's 6-yard rushing touchdown. Late in the fourth quarter, New York drove inside the Eagles 20 and had a chance to put the game away, only to have Joe Danelo miss a 32-yard field goal attempt. Philadelphia then drove 80 yards, 44 of them coming from 3 Giants penalties, in 9 plays to score on Montgomery's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 27-21 with 2:51 left in the game. But the Giants were able to run out the rest of the clock, picking up gains of six, three, and five yards on runs by Carpenter for a key first down. It marked the Giants first postseason victory since 1956.\n\nBrunner completed only nine of 14 passes for 96 yards, but threw three touchdowns and only one interception. Most of the Giants offense came from Carpenter, who had 33 carries for 161 yards and four receptions for 32. This game marked a disappointing end to a promising season for the Eagles, who had started out 9-2, but then lost all but one of their remaining games.\n\nThe Cowboys crushed the Buccaneers, limiting them to 24 rushing yards and 222 total yards. Bucs quarterback Doug Williams threw four interceptions (three of which resulted in touchdowns), committed two intentional grounding penalties, and was sacked four times.\n\nAfter the first quarter was scoreless, Dallas defensive back Dennis Thurman's 19-yard interception return to the Bucs 47-yard line set up Danny White's 9-yard touchdown pass to receiver Tony Hill. Tampa Bay responded with a 59-yard drive to the Cowboys 21-yard line. But on second down and 6, Dallas lineman Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones plowed through a block attempt by Charley Hannah and chased Williams all the way back to the 49-yard line before he grounded the ball with a desperate throw. The lost yardage on the grounding penalty pushed the Buccaneers out of field goal range and they ended up punting. Cowboys kicker Rafael Septién later added a 32-yard field goal to give the Cowboys a 10–0 halftime lead. A key aspect that had worked against Tampa Bay in the first half was starting field position. Their first half drives started from the 21, 20, 8, 20, 8 and 19-yard lines. Cowboys coach Tom Landry twice rejected long field-goal attempts from the 34 and 37, and each time White (who also played punter) punted the ball out of bounds at the 8.\n\nDallas took the opening kickoff of the second half and marched 80-yards, including a 25-yard gain on a screen pass reception by Tony Dorsett, to score on running back Ron Springs' 1-yard rushing touchdown. Then rookie free safety Michael Downs picked off a pass from Williams and returned it 21 yards to the Tampa Bay 33, leading to Dorsett's 5-yard score that put the team up 24-0. On the next drive, defensive tackle John Dutton deflected Williams' pass into the arms of Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones for an interception on the Bucs 25-yard line, and the Cowboys scored another touchdown with a 5-yard run by James Jones. In the fourth quarter, Williams completed a 75-yard pass to Jimmie Giles on the Cowboys 5-yard line, but the Buccaneers were still unable to get any points on the drive. On second and 8, Williams was sacked by Harvey Martin for a 9-yard loss, and then turned the ball over with consecutive incompletions. Later on, a pass interference penalty in the end zone against Tampa Bay defensive back Cedric Brown set up the final score of the game on Timmy Newsome's 1-yard run.\n\nWhite completed 15 of 26 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown. Dorsett was the top rusher of the game with 85 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 48 yards. Thurman had two interceptions and 50 return yards.\n\nChargers placekicker Rolf Benirschke kicked the winning 29-yard field goal after 13:52 of overtime, ending a game that became known in National Football League lore as the Epic in Miami. This game set playoff records for the most points scored in a playoff game (79), most total yards by both teams (1,036), and most passing yards by both teams (809).\n\nOn San Diego's opening drive, Dan Fouts' 47-yard completion to Wes Chandler set up Benirschke's 32-yard field goal. Then Miami was forced to punt and Chandler returned the ball 56 yards for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, the ball hit the ground and bounced back in the Chargers direction, enabling them to recover it and eventually score on running back Chuck Muncie's 1-yard rushing touchdown. On the Dolphins next possession, Chargers safety Glen Edwards intercepted a pass from David Woodley and returned it 35 yards to set up Fouts' 8-yard touchdown pass to rookie running back James Brooks, which increased the score to 24–0.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, Woodley was replaced by Don Strock who started off his first play with a 17-yard completion to Duriel Harris on a drive that Uwe von Schamann finished with a 34-yard field goal. Miami's defense subsequently recovered a fumble from Fouts, giving their offense the ball on the Chargers 39-yard line, and Strock took advantage, leading them to score on his 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joe Rose. Later on, Benirschke missed a 55-yard field goal attempt, giving Miami the ball with good field position. Three plays later from the 40-yard line, Strock took the snap and threw a pass intended for Harris at the 20-yard line. Harris caught the ball and immediately lateraled it to Tony Nathan, who then took it 25 yards to the end zone as time expired in the half, cutting the deficit to 24–17.\n\nIn the third quarter, Miami drove 74 yards and tied it at 24, with Strock's 15-yard touchdown completion to Rose. San Diego countered with a 6-play, 60-yard drive to score on Fouts' 25-yard touchdown completion to tight end Kellen Winslow. But Miami re-tied the game with Strock completing six consecutive passes, the last a 50-yard score to Bruce Hardy. Then Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood's interception set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Nathan, giving Miami their first lead of the game, 38–31, on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, with Miami just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers safety Pete Shaw recovered a fumble from Andra Franklin on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 seconds left in the game, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a blind pass intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but went right into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game.\n\nMiami took over on their own 40-yard line following Benirschke's squib kick, needing only a field goal to win. Following an incomplete pass, Strock's next throw was intercepted by Willie Buchanon, but as he made the diving catch, he fumbled the ball back to Miami when he hit the ground. After that, Nathan's 17-yard reception and Tommy Vigorito's 6-yard run moved the Dolphins to the Chargers 26-yard line where von Schamann attempted a 43-yard field goal, but at the last second, Winslow extended his 6'5\" frame at the line just enough to deflect the kick with his fingers, causing it to fall short of the goal posts and sending the game into overtime.\n\nIn overtime, the Chargers took the opening kickoff and advanced to the Miami 8-yard line, but Benirschke missed a 27-yard field goal attempt. Then after both teams exchanged punts twice, the Dolphins reached the San Diego 17-yard line, only to see von Schamann's 34-yard attempt get blocked by defensive lineman Leroy Jones. Aided by two receptions from Charlie Joiner for 49 yards, the Chargers then drove 74 yards to the Miami 10-yard line, where Benirschke eventually kicked the winning field goal.\n\nStrock turned in the best game of his life, completing 29 of 43 passes for 403 yards and four touchdowns, while Fouts put on one of the best performances of his Hall of Fame career, completing 33 of 53 passes for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Harris caught six passes for 106 yards. Nathan rushed for 48 yards, caught nine passes for 114 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Muncie rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 56-yard punt return touchdown, Chandler caught six passes for 106 yards. Brooks recorded 143 all-purpose yards. The image of an exhausted Winslow, who finished the game with 13 receptions for 166 yards and a touchdown, being helped off the field by two of his Chargers teammates is now an iconic visual of NFL Films.\n\nThe Bengals earned their first playoff win in team history after Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson's fourth-down pass fell incomplete while attempting to drive for the tying touchdown.\n\nTwo key plays allowed the Bengals to start their first two drives in Buffalo territory, and they took advantage of their field position with touchdowns on each one. First, defensive back Mike Fuller returned a punt 27 yards to the Bills 42-yard line. Six plays later (one a 14-yard catch by tight end Dan Ross), Charles Alexander scored on a 4-yard touchdown run. On Buffalo's ensuing drive, defensive back Ken Riley intercepted a pass from Ferguson on the Bills 48-yard line. Cincinnati then drove 48 yards in eight plays, including Isaac Curtis' 22-yard reception on second and 17, to score with fullback Pete Johnson's 1-yard run, giving them a 14–0 lead before Buffalo had gained a single first down or completed a pass.\n\nAfter another Buffalo punt, Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson completed an 18-yard pass to Ross to give his team a first down on the Bills 41-yard line. Cincinnati eventually drove inside the 10, but the Bills made a key defensive stand, as defensive end Ken Johnson sacked Anderson at the 15 on third down and then Robb Riddick leaped high in the air to block Jim Breech's 33-yard field goal attempt. This seemed to spark Buffalo's offense, which subsequently picked up three first downs on a drive to the Bengals 30-yard line, but they also came up empty when linebacker Bo Harris intercepted Ferguson's pass and returned it 16 yards to the 24. Following a Bengals punt, Ferguson's 54-yard completion to Jerry Butler set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Joe Cribbs, cutting the score to 14–7 by halftime.\n\nEarly in the third quarter, the Bills advanced 69 yards in five plays, starting with Ferguson's 15-yard pass to Frank Lewis and ending with a 44-yard touchdown run by Cribbs to tie the game. Cincinnati's David Verser returned the ensuing kickoff 40 yards to their 35-yard line, and the team responded with a 7-play 65-yard drive, including a 13-yard scramble by Anderson, to retake the lead with a 20-yard touchdown run by Alexander. Buffalo struck right back with a 79-yard scoring drive. Cribbs was injured and knocked out of the game on the first play, but his replacement Roland Hooks rushed five times for 24 yards and caught a pass for 6, while Ferguson finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Butler, tying the game back up at 21 on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nWith 10:39 left in the game, Anderson threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Cris Collinsworth, giving the Bengals a 28–21 lead at the end of a 9-play, 79-yard drive that saw him burn the Bills with a 42-yard completion on a short pass to Steve Kreider on third and 1 from the Bengals 42-yard line. The Bills drove to the Cincinnati 21-yard line with about three minutes left to play, and it appeared that Ferguson completed a fourth-down pass to Lou Piccone to gain a first down. However, Buffalo was called for a delay of game penalty, and Ferguson's pass attempt on the next snap fell incomplete. The Bills defense managed to force a punt with under a minute left, but Ferguson threw four consecutive incompletions as time expired in the game.\n\nBuffalo's miscue on their final drive was particularly noteworthy in that it came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual. One cited reason for this was the last second substitution of receivers Piccone and Ron Jessie into the huddle. Bills coach Chuck Knox later explained this was an attempt to prevent the defense from adjusting to new personnel, an attempt that would have paid off if the ball had been snapped on time, as Piccone did make a first down catch on the ensuing play.\n\nAnderson finished the game with 14 of 21 completions for 192 yards and a touchdown. Johnson, the team's leading rusher with 1,077 yards during the season, was held to just 45 yards, but it did not matter as the Bengals still racked up 136 yards on the ground, 72 of them and two touchdowns from Alexander. Ferguson threw for 202 yards and a touchdown, but completed only 15 of 31 passes and was intercepted twice. Cribbs finished with a career postseason high 90 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Butler caught four passes for 98 yards and a score.\n\n25-year-old San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana led the 49ers to victory in his first playoff game, completing 20 of 31 passes for a career-high 304 yards and two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nThe 49ers jumped to a 24–7 lead in the second quarter, and scored two touchdowns in the final quarter to secure the victory. San Francisco took the opening kickoff and advanced 85 yards in 13 plays, assisted by a defensive holding penalty on a punt that allowed them to keep the drive going. Montana finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown to tight end Charle Young. Two drives later, the Giants countered when quarterback Scott Brunner threw a pass to wide receiver Earnest Gray, who caught it at his own 40, evaded three 49ers defensive backs, and raced to the end zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception. 49ers running back Amos Lawrence returned the following kickoff 47 yards to the Giants 48-yard line. The 49ers soon faced 3rd and 17 from the 44, but Montana was able to convert with a 39-yard completion to Dwight Clark, which led to a 22-yard field goal by Ray Wersching that gave them a 10-7 lead on the first play of the second quarter.\n\nOn the Giants next possession, defensive back Ronnie Lott's interception gave the 49ers a first down on their own 31-yard line, where they drove to a 17-7 lead on Freddie Solomon's 58-yard touchdown reception. Linebacker Keena Turner recovered a fumble from Leon Bright on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, and Ricky Patton scored on a 25-yard touchdown run a few plays later to give the 49ers a 24–7 lead. New York then drove 52 yards in 13 plays to score on 48-yard field goal by Joe Danelo, making it 24–10. The 49ers had a chance to increase their lead before halftime, but Wersching missed a 50-yard field goal attempt with less than a minute left.\n\nOn the opening drive of the third quarter, Montana threw an interception to Bill Currier on the Giants 41-yard line. Brunner completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Johnny Perkins on the next play to make it 24–17. The next time they had the ball, New York drove 85 yards to the 49ers 4-yard line, but it ended there and Danelo hit the uprights on a 21-yard field goal attempt. In the fourth quarter, Solomon returned a Giants punt 22 yards to the New York 36-yard line, and the 49ers went on to score on Bill Ring's 3-yard rushing touchdown. Later on, Lott returned his second interception of the game 20 yards to the end zone to give San Francisco a 38-17 lead and clinch the game. Brunner then made a 17-yard touchdown to Perkins to close out the scoring.\n\nSolomon was the 49ers top receiver with 6 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 12 yards and returning a punt for 22. Clark added 5 receptions for 104 yards. Perkins finished the day with 7 receptions for 121 yards, while Gray had 3 for 117.\n\nCBS's broadcast of the Giants-49ers NFC Divisional Playoff game also featured the introduction of the telestrator to a national audience.\n\nIn a game subsequently known as the Freezer Bowl, the Bengals defeated the Chargers 27–7. Despite a game-time temperature of and a 35-mile-per-hour wind that sent wind chills as low as −59 °F, Bengals' quarterback Ken Anderson threw for 161 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions, and rushed for 39 yards to lead his team to a victory. Cincinnati's defense intercepted San Diego quarterback Dan Fouts twice and recovered two fumbles, while their offense did not commit a single turnover until late in the third quarter when they already had a solid lead.\n\nAided by an 18-yard completion from Anderson to tight end Dan Ross, Cincinnati scored first with a 31-yard field goal from kicker Jim Breech. Then linebacker Rick Razzano forced a fumble from Chargers' rookie kick returner James Brooks, and Don Bass recovered for the Bengals on the San Diego 12-yard line. Following a 4-yard run by Charles Alexander, the Bengals scored a touchdown on an 8-yard pass from Anderson to tight end M. L. Harris, increasing their lead to 10–0. Brooks returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 43-yard line. Then on third down and 9, Fouts' 21-yard completion to Wes Chandler moved the ball to the Bengals 33. But Cincinnati's defense halted the drive at the 18-yard line and it ended with no points when Rolf Benirschke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt.\n\nAfter a Bengals punt, Chandler gave the Chargers good field position with a 7-yard return to the 45-yard line. San Diego then drove 55 yards and cut their deficit to 10–7 when Fouts, desperately trying to avoid a hit from lineman Eddie Edwards, managed to fire a pass to Kellen Winslow at the line of scrimmage, who subsequently raced 33 yards down the right sideline for a score. But the Bengals stormed right back on a drive set up by David Verser's 40-yard kickoff to the 46-yard line. Faced with third down and 7 inside the red zone later in the drive, Anderson kept the drive going with a 16-yard completion to Isaac Curtis on the Chargers 1-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson scored a touchdown run on the next play, giving them a 17–7 lead.\n\nThe Bengals completely took over the game from that point on. The Chargers would move the ball inside the Bengals 40-yard line five times during the rest of the game, but failed to score on each possession. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 33-yard line, but came up empty when defensive back Louis Breeden intercepted a deep pass intended for Charlie Joiner at the 5-yard line. The Chargers defense quickly gave the offense another scoring opportunity, forcing a punt from Pat McInally that went just 32 yards to the Bengals 45. But once again this amounted to nothing as Fouts was intercepted in the end zone by rookie safety Bobby Kemp.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, San Diego drove to the Bengals 38-yard line, only to lose their fourth turnover of the day when Reggie Williams stripped the ball from Chuck Muncie and Cincinnati lineman Ross Browner recovered it. Then Anderson went to work, rushing three times for 31 yards and completing a 19-yard pass to Ross on a drive that moved the ball inside the San Diego 10-yard line. Following three incompletions and a touchdown called back by a holding penalty, Breech's 38-yard field goal made the score 20–7. On their next drive, Anderson's five completions moved the ball deep into Chargers territory, but defensive back Willie Buchanon put an end to it when he recovered a fumble from Ross that had been forced by Woodrow Lowe. The Chargers then drove to the Bengals 20-yard line, but on third down, Fouts tripped over the foot of guard Doug Wilkerson and was downed for an 11-yard loss. Then Benirschke missed a 50-yard field goal try on the next play.\n\nTaking the ball back after the missed field goal, Cincinnati put the game away with a 14-play touchdown drive. Anderson was injured early in the drive and replaced for two plays by Jack Thompson. But Johnson kept the Bengals moving on those plays, first rushing for eight yards and then gaining 14 yards on a screen pass on third down and 8. Later on the drive, Johnson converted a fourth and inches situation with a 7-yard run, and Anderson eventually finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Bass, making the final score 27–7. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 5-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs with less than three minutes left.\n\nIn a play that would become known as The Catch, 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark made a leaping grab at the back of the end zone to score the winning touchdown with 51 seconds left in the game. The win sent the 49ers to their first Super Bowl and snapped their three-game playoff losing streak to the Cowboys.\n\nAfter forcing Dallas to punt on the opening drive, San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana completed a 17-yard pass to Charle Young and a 24-yarder to Lenvil Elliott before throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Freddie Solomon. Dallas responded with Danny White's 20-yard pass to Butch Johnson setting up a 44-yard field goal by Rafael Septién. Then 49ers running back Bill Ring lost a fumble on his own 29, leading to White's 26-yard touchdown pass to Tony Hill that put the Cowboys up 10-7.\n\nIn the second quarter, San Francisco reached the Cowboys 27-yard line, only to lose the ball when Everson Walls intercepted a pass from Montana in the end zone. But after forcing a Dallas punt, Montana threw a 20-yard touchdown to Clark to retake the lead, 14–10. Dallas responded with an 80-yard drive, including a controversial pass interference penalty on 49ers defensive back Ronnie Lott which nullified his interception and gave the Cowboys a 35-yard gain at the San Francisco 12-yard line. Three plays later, running back Tony Dorsett scored on a 5-yard rushing touchdown to give Dallas a 17–14 lead. The 49ers got another chance to score before halftime when they recovered a fumbled punt on the Dallas 42. But after a 15-yard illegal block penalty on Clark, Montana lost a fumble while being sacked by Harvey Martin. The Cowboys fared no better as White was sacked twice on their next drive, once by Jim Stuckey and once by Lawrence Pillers, and the half ended soon after.\n\nIn the third quarter, San Francisco got another scoring opportunity when Dwight Hicks returned a punt 12 yards to midfield. The 49ers then drove to the Dallas 16-yard line, but once again they failed to score when Montana threw a pass that bounced out of Elliott's hands and was intercepted by Randy White. However, the Cowboys soon returned the favor with Danny White's interception to linebacker Bobby Leopold, and this time the 49ers converted, regaining the lead at 21-17 with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Johnny Davis.\n\nOne minute into the fourth quarter, Septien kicked a 22-yard field goal that cut the deficit to 21-20. Then Walls recovered a fumble from running back Walt Easley at midfield to set up White's 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Cosbie, giving Dallas a 27–21 advantage. Things got even better for Dallas when Walls recorded his second interception from Montana on the next drive at the Cowboys 27. Dallas managed to pick up a few first downs, but was forced to punt, and White's kick gave San Francisco the ball at their own 11 with 4:54 left in the game.\n\nMontana subsequently led the 49ers 83 yards to the Dallas 6-yard line. Elliott rushed four times for 30 yards on the drive, while Solomon also made a big impact, catching two passes for 18 yards and rushing for 15 on a wide receiver reverse. Facing third down and 3 on the Cowboys 6 with 58 seconds left, Montana threw a high pass that Clark just managed to break ahead of Walls and reach in the air for the game-winning touchdown reception. Other contributors on the final 89-yard drive that led to the play now referred to as “The Catch” included Freddie Solomon (WR), Lenvil Elliott (RB), Earl Cooper (FB), Mike Wilson, Charle Young (TE), Dan Audick (LT), John Ayers (LG), Fred Quillan (C), Randy Cross (RG), and Keith Fahnhorst (RT).\n\nHowever, the Cowboys needed only a field goal to win, and still had enough time left in the game for one last drive. White threw a completion to Drew Pearson that almost went for a touchdown, but 49ers defensive back Eric Wright made a key tackle by getting one hand inside Pearson's jersey and dragging him down. One play later, Pillers sacked White, forcing a fumble that was recovered by Stuckey, and the 49ers had their victory. Clark finished the game with eight receptions for 120 yards and two touchdowns. Dallas defensive back Everson Walls intercepted two passes and recovered a fumble, though he had the misfortune of being assigned to cover Clark on \"the catch\" play. San Francisco won despite losing six turnovers.\n\n"}

{"id": "1811237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811237", "title": "Midwife toad", "text": "Midwife toad\n\nMidwife toads (\"Alytes\") are a genus of frogs in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae), and are found in most of Europe and northwestern Africa. Characteristic of these toad-like frogs is their parental care: the males carry a string of fertilised eggs on their back, hence the name \"midwife\". The female expels a strand of eggs, which the male fertilizes externally. He then wraps them around his legs to protect them from predators in the water. When they are ready to hatch, the male wades into shallow water, where he allows the tadpoles to leap out of their eggs. Five separate species of midwife toad are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca.\n\nMidwife toads can be found in the snows of the Pyrenees, living at heights of 5,000–6,500 feet in areas such as the Néouvielle massif. Unlike the thin tongue of many amphibians, the midwife's tongue is round and flattened; its former family name, Discoglossidae, means \"round tongue\". In parts of France midwife toads live in sand dunes by the sea. They share this habitat with natterjack toads.\n\nFive separate species of midwife toad are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca. Shy, nocturnal animals, they give away their presence by their ringing call. During the day, the midwife toad hides under stones and logs or in tunnels. They often hide in dry, sandy soil, which is easier to dig into using their forelegs and snout. It emerges at dusk to forage for food, but always returns to the same hiding places before dawn. During the winter, the common midwife toad hibernates in its hole or in a burrow that has been deserted by a small animal.\n\nThe Midwife toad crawls around the area close to its hiding place at night to search for food. The toad uses the end of its long, sticky tongue to pick up prey, including beetles, crickets, flies, caterpillars, centipedes, ants and millipedes. Tadpoles feed on vegetable matter. They chew with tiny, horny teeth. Young toads eat smaller sizes of the same prey that adults feed on. When the eggs are ready to hatch the male leaves them near the water.\n\nThe back of the midwife toad is covered with small warts. These warts give off an odorous poison when the toad is handled or attacked. The poison is so powerful that the toad has few enemies or predators. The poison also helps to keep the egg strings on the male's back safe from attack. The tadpole does not possess the poison, and therefore falls prey to fish and insects.\n\nThe Majorcan midwife toad has adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of this Spanish Island. It is found only in deep canyons in the northern mountains. It has evolved to have a flatter body, which enables the toad to squeeze into narrow crevices in the rocks of its habitat. The only moisture available is in small, rain-filled puddles on ledges. Tadpoles are born and develop in these pools. Fossils of these species have also been found in Europe.\n\nApoptosis, the programmed cell death, was first observed in the developing of the tadpoles of the midwife toads 1842 by Carl Vogt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811242", "title": "Gas-operated reloading", "text": "Gas-operated reloading\n\nGas-operation is a system of operation used to provide energy to operate locked breech, autoloading firearms. In gas-operation, a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to dispose of the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber. Energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. This high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a piston head to provide motion for unlocking of the action, extraction of the spent case, ejection, cocking of the hammer or striker, chambering of a fresh cartridge, and locking of the action.\n\nThe first mention of using a gas piston in a single-shot breech-loading rifle comes from 1856, by the American Edward Lindner. In 1866, Englishman William Curtis filed the first patent on a gas-operated repeating rifle, but subsequently failed to develop that idea further. Between 1883 and 1885, Hiram Maxim filed a number of patents on blowback-, recoil-, and gas-operation. In 1889, the Austro-Hungarian Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda filed a patent for the first successful gas-operated machine gun.\n\nMost current gas systems employ some type of piston. The face of the piston is acted upon by combustion gas from a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. Early guns, such as Browning's \"flapper\" prototype, the Bang rifle, and Garand rifle, used relatively low-pressure gas from at or near the muzzle. This, combined with larger operating parts, reduced the strain on the mechanism. To simplify and lighten the firearm, gas from nearer the chamber needed to be used. This high-pressure gas has sufficient force to destroy a firearm unless it is regulated somehow. Most gas-operated firearms rely on tuning the gas port size, mass of operating parts, and spring pressures to function. Several other methods are employed to regulate the energy. The M1 carbine incorporates a very short piston, or \"tappet.\" This movement is closely restricted by a shoulder recess. This mechanism inherently limits the amount of gas taken from the barrel. The M14 rifle and M60 GPMG use the White expansion and cutoff system to stop (cut off) gas from entering the cylinder once the piston has traveled a short distance. Most systems, however, vent excess gas into the atmosphere through slots, holes, or ports.\n\nA gas trap system involves \"trapping\" combustion gas as it leaves the muzzle. This gas impinges on a surface that converts the energy to motion that, in turn cycles the action of the firearm. Hiram Maxim patented a muzzle-cup system in 1884 described in though it is unknown if this firearm was ever prototyped. John Browning used gas trapped at the muzzle to operate a \"flapper\" in the earliest prototype gas-operated firearm described in . The Danish Bang rifle used a muzzle cup blown forward by muzzle gas to operate the action through transfer bars and leverage. Other gas-trap rifles were early production M1 Garands and German Gewehr 41 (both Walther and Mauser models). These systems are longer, heavier, dirtier and more complex than later gas-operated firearms. Despite these disadvantages, they used relatively low pressure gas and did not require a hole in the barrel. The American and German governments both had requirements that their guns operated without a hole being drilled in the barrel. Both governments would first adopt weapons and later abandon the concept. Most earlier US M1 Garand rifles were retrofitted with long-stroke gas pistons, making the surviving gas trap rifles valuable in the collector's market.\n\nWith a long-stroke system, the piston is mechanically fixed to the bolt group and moves through the entire operating cycle. This system is used in weapons such as the Bren light machine gun, AK-47, Tavor, FN Minimi, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, FN MAG, FN FNC, and M1 Garand. The primary advantage of the long-stroke system is that the mass of the piston rod adds to the momentum of the bolt carrier enabling more positive extraction, ejection, chambering, and locking. The primary disadvantage to this system is the disruption of the point of aim due to several factors such as: the center of mass changing during the action cycle, abrupt stops at the beginning and end of bolt carrier travel, and the use of the barrel as a fulcrum to drive the bolt back. Also, due to the greater mass of moving parts, more gas is required to operate the system that, in turn, requires larger operating parts.\n\nWith a short-stroke or tappet system, the piston moves separately from the bolt group. It may directly push the bolt group parts, as in the M1 carbine, or operate through a connecting rod or assembly, as in the Armalite AR-18 or the SKS. In either case, the energy is imparted in a short, abrupt push and the motion of the gas piston is then arrested allowing the bolt carrier assembly to continue through the operating cycle through kinetic energy. This has the advantage of reducing the total mass of recoiling parts compared with a long-stroke piston. This, in turn, enables better control of the weapon due to less mass needing to be stopped at either end of the bolt carrier travel. This design is available both on the civilian and military markets as retrofit to the AR15 family of weapons for addressing the perceived shortcomings of the Stoner gas system.\n\nThe direct impingement (DI) method of operation vents gas from partway down the barrel through a tube to the working parts of a rifle where they directly impinge on the bolt carrier. This results in a simpler, lighter mechanism. Firearms that use this system include the French MAS-40 from 1940, the Swedish Ag m/42 from 1942. The gas system of the American M16 series and M4 utilizes a gas tube to directly impinge the bolt carrier, while the USMC's M27 is based on the piston-driven H&K 416. One principal advantage is that the moving parts are placed in-line with the bore meaning that sight picture is not disturbed as much. This offers a particular advantage for fully automatic mechanisms. It has the disadvantage of the propellant gas (and the accompanying fouling) being blown directly into the action parts. DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing, which can burn off and cover up lubricants. The bolt, extractor, ejector, pins, and springs are also heated by the same high-temperature gas. These combined factors reduce service life of these parts, reliability, and mean time between failures.\n\nThe French Chauchat, German MG-42 machine gun, the British Vickers machine gun, and some other recoil operated firearms use a gas trap style mechanism to provide additional energy to 'boost' the energy provided by recoil. This \"boost\" provides higher rates of fire and/or more reliable operation. It is alternately called a \"gas assist\", and may also be found in some types of blank-firing adapters.\n\nEarly machine guns were expensive to operate. The United States Army wanted to train machine gun crews with less-expensive ammunition. To do this, they needed the .22 LR cartridge to operate firearms designed to use the .30-06 cartridge. David Marshall Williams invented a method that involved a separate floating chamber that acted as a gas piston with combustion gas impinging directly on the front of the floating chamber. The .22 caliber Colt Service Ace conversion kit for the .45 caliber M1911 pistol also used Williams' system, which allows a much heavier slide than other conversions operating on the unaugmented blowback mechanism and makes training with the converted pistol realistic. A floating chamber provides additional force to operate the heavier slide, providing a felt recoil level similar to that of a full power cartridge.\n\nThe bolt is not locked but is pushed rearward by the expanding propellant gases as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It is used by Volkssturmgewehr 1-5 rifle, the Heckler & Koch P7, Steyr GB and Walther CCP pistols.\n\nPatented by August Schüler, the Reform pistol featured a vertical row of barrels that advanced upwards with each shot exposing the fired chamber. As the lower barrel fired, a gas hole between the barrels pressurized the empty barrel enough to eject the case rearward. An extended spur on the hammer prevented the spent case from hitting the firer in the face. The final case required manual extraction.\n\n"}

The band states that their legal name is the \"Chippewas of Saugeen\". Organized in the mid-1970s, Saugeen First Nation is the primary \"political successor apparent\" to the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory; the other First Nation that is a part of Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory is Cape Croker. The Ojibway are of the Algonquian languages family. The First Nation consist of four reserves: Chief's Point 28, Saugeen 29, Saugeen Hunting Grounds 60A, and Saugeen and Cape Croker Fishing Islands 1.\n\nThe Saugeen First Nation Web site states that \"the Ojibway heritage is rich in colour and expression. This is evident in dance, works of art and the hand made craft creations\".\n\nThe original historic people of Saugeen are Ojibway. They became known as Chippewa by English-speaking people who could not pronounce the word Ojibway. \"Chippewas of Saugeen\" is the legal name of the community. Like other Aboriginal people in Canada, in the early 1970s the Chippewas of Saugeen began referring to their community as a \"First Nation.\"\n\nArchaeological evidence proves the modern Bruce Peninsula (or the \"Saugeen Peninsula\" as it is known by the Ojibway) was home to the Chippewas of Saugeen. From time immemorial, hunting and fishing were plentiful in this area. Archaeologists have found artifacts from the Early Woodland Period (1000 BCE to 1000 CE), and have called this culture the Saugeen Complex, in archeological terms. Other than pottery, the projectile points called Saugeen Point are typical characteristics of the Saugeen culture. Winter camps around Owen Sound, Cape Croker and the Collingwood area, as well as summer camps in Walkerton, Wiarton, Goderich, Tobermory and Red Bay were associated with the Saugeen Complex and descendant Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory. Traditional territory also included all of the Saugeen River watershed. Thus, places such as Tobermory, Meaford, Goderich, Cape Croker, Owen Sound, and Orangeville are located in the traditional Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The permanent settlement at the outlet of the Saugeen River, which lent its name to the region and its people, was called \"Zaageeng\", meaning \"mouth of river.\"\n\nThe Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway are a member of the Council of Three Fires of the Ojibway, Odawa, and Pottawatomi nations. The Confederacy came to help in the Battle of Skull Mound and in the Battle of Blue Mountain.\n\nThe Wyandotte/Wendat Nation also made the area their home, as did the related Petun or Tobacco people. Both of these were Iroquoian-speaking peoples.\n\nFour of Seven major clans or \"doodem\" are found among the Chippewas of Saugeen.\n\nOne of the earliest documents recognizing Nation to Nation relations between the Crown and Indigenous peoples in North America, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stated \"Indian land\" could only be sold to the Crown. It attempted to reserve areas west of the Allegheny Mountains in the Thirteen Colonies to Native Americans, but the Crown could not control the movement of colonists.\n\nPeople from many nations moved into Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory after the disruption of the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. Many came from Ohio and from the State of New York. As a result of the American Indian Removal Policies of the 1830s and the Treaty of Chicago in 1833, a large number of Potawatomi Indians from Michigan and Wisconsin were forced from their homelands, settling at Cape Croker, Saugeen, and many other reserves in Ontario. In 1907 W.M. Wooster was tasked by the United States Congress to locate and record a census of Potawatomi that fled into Canada. Wooster, with the assistance of interpreter Charles Keeshick, recorded 318 Potawatomi living in Cape Croker and 306 Potawatomi living in Saugeen.\n\nSome were on their way to the Manitoulin Island project, the traditional homeland of the Odawa. Some moved from Coldwater on the Narrows. Others came from the Toronto and Niagara regions after newcomers encroached on their territories. Due to these influxes of people from other areas, the history of the Chippewas of Saugeen is often confused with others who settled in Ojibway Territory after the American Revolution. Particularly, the history of those who settled in Cape Croker in 1854 has been confused with the history of the Chippewas of Saugeen.\n\nWithin 50 years of the Royal Proclamation, European residents of Upper Canada and its partners wanted the surrounding Indian lands, including the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The army, Indian Affairs and missionaries were aided by some Aboriginal people from other parts of Canada in achieving the “surrender” of the Saugeen territory.\n\nSir Francis Bond Head, represented the government of Upper Canada, T.G. Anderson signed on behalf of Indian Affairs, J. Stinson signed for Wesley Missions, and F.L. Ingall represented the 15th Regiment of the Army. Three other non-Aboriginal men witnessed the signing. Four “Indian” men, who were not chiefs or head men of Saugeen, signed by their \"doodem\" and agreed to: “surrender Sauking Territory” and to “repair to (Manitoulin) Island or to the territory north of Owen Sound.” They were Mettiewabe, Kaquta Bunevairear, Kowgiswasis, and Mettawansh.\n\nThe original people of Saugeen never surrendered or signed away their land or water.\n\nIn 1834 some people attempted to surrender Saugeen’s Fishing Islands by leasing them to the Huron Fishing Company. But again they were not the Chippewas of Saugeen; they were Jacob Metigwob, from Manitoulin Island, John Ansance from Christian Island, and the Matweyosh families from the Caldwell Band of the Chippewas of Point Pelee.\n\nAround that time, the provincial government wanted all Anishnabek people to agree to surrender their traditional territory and move to Manitoulin Island. And, many people from the Coldwater and Point Pelee area sought shelter in Saugeen territory after other events and when other people moved into their homeland.\n\nAccording to some people, the chief of the Saugeen Ojibway at the time of the Saugeen Tract Agreement was Wahbahdick. Chief Wahbahdick’s name or doodem is not on the Saugeen Tract Agreement.\n\nAccording to the First Nation stories, the last traditional chief of the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory was John Kedugegwan/Kewaquom. A memorial in the cemetery at Chippewa Hill records John Kedugegwan as the last hereditary chief of Saugeen.\n\nPeter Jones b. January 1, 1802-d.1856, was a Mississauga from the Credit River. He was also a Methodist missionary. To the Ojibway he became known as Kahkewaquonaby (Sacred Waving Feathers, referring to the feathers taken from the eagle).\n\nThe Kewaquom name is from an original family of the Saugeen Territory. It is associated with the sound Thunder Going Home. They are of the Eagle Clan. Peter Jones said, that by \"taking this name I was dedicated to the Thunder God.\" Thunder birds are represented by eagles. Eagle feathers are used in all sacred Ojibwe ceremonies.\n\nPeter Jones was the son of Tuhbenahneequay, the daughter of Head Chief Wahbansay, and a Welsh surveyor, Augustus Jones. His niece Nahnebahwequa, or Catherine, and her husband William Sutton traveled with him to Saugeen Territory and also lived at the Ojibway camp at Owen Sound. They went to England to solicit funds for their missionary work. Catherine Sutton is also reported to have met with Queen Victoria to ask for compensation for her property. Peter Jones married an Englishwoman, Eliza Field, and had five children.\n\nPeter Jones baptized Chief Kegedonce. Kegedonce was the Chief of the Naguhweseebee-Ausable River Band, who occupied territory near Port Franks, now known as the Pinery-Ipperwash area. Kegedonce took the Christian name Peter and became known as Peter Kegedonce Jones. He told Peter Jones he would accept Christianity if Chief Wawanosh from Sarnia did. In the directory of \"First Nations Individuals in South Western Ontario 1750-1850,\" by Greg Curnoe, Kegedonce is recorded as telling Rev. Peter Jones that he wanted to settle at Saugeen and accept presents at the mouth of the Red River-Goderich.\n\nChief Kegedonce Jones was found murdered near Goderich in 1831. His wife and family moved to the Owen Sound village, \"to escape Kegedonce's enemies\" (Mullin 1997). His son, also named Peter Kegedonce Jones, would later become a chief.\n\nIn compliance with their agreement, Indian Affairs built eight houses. Thomas Anderson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs noted on November 6, 1845 that “Four families from outside Saugeen Territory, two Michigan Pottawatomi and two from elsewhere in Canada occupied those houses.”\n\nChief Wahbudick lived at the Owen Sound village of the Saugeen people when others sought shelter in the territory.\n\nThe Imperial Proclamation of 1847 imposes various conditions for surrender of lands and states that no surrender \"shall be approved of or acted upon unless resolved on or approved at a meeting of \"Sachems Chiefs\" or \"principal men\" of the said \"Ojibway Indians\" . . .”\n\nOn October 13, 1854, the church and the government gathered some men to place their name on their proposed cession and division of more of the Saugeen territory.\n\nKezigkoenene (\"Giizhigowinini\"), or David Sawyer, was the cousin of Peter Jones-Kahkewaquonaby; he was from the Credit River. He was the son of \"Nawahjegezhewabe,\" Chief Joseph Sawyer who was b.1786 in Genesee County, New York. Records in the Canadian Archives note that David Sawyer came to live with some of the people at the Owen Sound village that eventually became known as Nawash. It is recorded that the Nawash, \"on March 9, 1855, passed a resolution that David Sawyer replace Kegedonce as their chief and interpreter.\" David Sawyer attended the mission school taught by Peter Jones' brother Thayendanega or John Jones. David Sawyer signed the treaty of 1854 to surrender most of Saugeen Territory.\n\nRecords in Library and Archives Canada state that, \"when Sawyer was absent from the Owen Sound area in 1856, the Indian Department\" secured the surrender\" when, \"a few Indians were invited to Toronto to sign a Treaty\" where they surrendered the Owen Sound village, \"including Sawyer's farm\" and Catherine Sutton's new home.\n\nTreaty No. 82 was signed at Toronto, February 9, 1857. It sold “the land upon which we now reside, commonly known as the Nawash or Owen Sound Reserve.”\n\nTreaty No. 93, surrendered the area known as Colpoy’s Bay of Saugeen Territory.\n\nThe 1851 census lists John Johnston as American Potawatomi. He signed the treaty of 1854.\n\nIn the \"Directory of First Nations Individuals in South-Western Ontario 1750–1850,\" Greg Curnoe records James Newash as an Odawa. He is reported to have moved to Saugeen after the War of 1812 and the Battle at Moraviantown in Ohio. It is said that Nawash fought with Tecumseh. He settled with his community on the fighting islands of Detroit River around 1815 and moved to the Miami River in 1819. James Newash also signed the Treaty of 1854 .\n\nCharles Keeshig is recorded as being a highly educated Pottawatomi from the United States who worked as an interpreter in Saugeen Territory. He was the brother-in-law of Peter Jones Kegedonce. That Kegedonce was the son of Kegedonce, Chief of the Ausable River people by Kettle and Stony Point.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs replaced David Sawyer with Charles Keeshick as agent for the people who became known as the Nawash of Owen Sound. Library and Archives Canada, notes that \"during Keeshick's term of office the band ceded to the government in 1854, almost all of the Bruce Peninsula.\" He signed the Treaty of 1854.\n\nThe Treaty of 1854 was one of the biggest land grabs in history. It involved the surrender of 1.5 million acres (6070 km²) of the traditional territory of the Saugeen Ojibway. It is recorded as No.72 : Surrender of the Saugeen Peninsula.\n\nThe \"doodem\" of Chief Wahbudick appears on that treaty even though Thomas Anderson, as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, had removed him from official office as the Chief of the Saugeen Ojibway.\n\nThe time of surrenders and treaties was very difficult for the Saugeen Ojibway. Most could not read or write English, which was the language used to sign and record land surrenders and treaties. It was also the time that people from other places allowed the Department of Indian Affairs into Saugeen Ojibway Territory to set up an elected form of government.\n\nA historical plaque, erected by the Province of Ontario, provides the following summary of developments during that era. (Location: Allenford, picnic area on the south side of Highway 21 just west of Allenford Road.) The plaque reads as follows:\n\nIn 1994, the Saugeen First Nation and the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation filed a lawsuit against the Government of Canada; the claims for land, and payment of rent on lands, discussed in early treaties are significant. The suit has yet to be settled. The Official Plan for the Town of Saugeen Shores (2014) includes the following comment about this issue: \"The Chippewas of the Saugeen First Nation and the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation have filed a Native Land Claim for the islands in the Saugeen River, the lands that border the north side of the Saugeen River and the shoreline from the mouth of the Saugeen River northerly around the Bruce Peninsula.\"\n\nNote too that in the areas around Sauble Beach and Southampton, numerous cottages are on land previously owned by a community or the County but now defined as part of the Native lands. Years earlier, the Saugeen First Nation had successfully reclaimed the land that \"runs south from the Sauble Beach sign toward Southampton, 18 kilometres away\", acccording to one news report. A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation and those who had built seasonal homes on the land in the a lakeside area between urban Southampton, Ontario and Sauble Beach. They pay an annual lease fee to the First Nation. The current lease contract between the cottagers and the two Saugeen First Nation Reserves, Saugeen 29 and Chief's Point 28, is in effect until 30 April 2021.\n\nThe Saugeen First Nation already owns and controls a large area of the beach (south portion) within the community of Sauble Beach, referred to by the band as Sauble Park or South Sauble Beach Park. In addition to the Sauble Park area, the Saugeen First Nation claims the rights to another stretch of the public beach, approximately 2 km long, west of Lakeshore Boulevard extending to a point between 1st St. South and 6th St. North. The matter has been in litigation since 1990 with the federal government backing the First Nation suit.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Saugeen First Nations Government consists of an elected Chief and nine Councillors. The current Chief is Lester Anoquot. The nine Councillors are:\n\n\nThe government of Canada and the Province of Ontario provides the funds for Saugeen First Nation, which are administered by different Departments such as:\n\nThe Saugeen First Nation's reserve includes four land reserves and portions of Lake Huron.\n\nThe reserve is 5.18 km2 (2.00 sq mi).\n\nThe reserve's size is 41.43 km2 (16.00 sq mi). As of 2011 the population is 726. It is considered the main reserve of the First Nation.\n\nThe reserve is 7.28 km2 (2.81 sq mi).\n\nThe reserve consist of 89 island shared with Saugeen First Nation.\nOf these three, the 63.81 km² (24.64 sq. mi.) Neyaashiinigmiing 27 is considered the main reserve and Saugeen & Cape Croker Fishing Island 1 is shared with Saugeen First Nation.\n\nDue to inadequate potable water supply to the First Nation, the Saugeen First Nation received a significant water and sewer improvement assistance of $14 million in the 2006-2007 fiscal year to provide the First Nation with clean treated drinking water. The new system consists of a connection to the town of Saugeen Shores municipal water supply system, construction of a pump house and above-grade reservoir, a water distribution system, back-up electrical generating system, elevated storage reservoir (water tower), and the decommissioning of six pump houses and associated small-diameter water mains. The drinking water is still treated in Southampton's new Zenon Environmental Water Treatment Plant. The improvement project was completed in July 2008.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many artisans in Saugeen First Nation who create many different kinds of handicraft and paintings. The most noted artist of the nation is Robert Henry Jr, who recently returned to the community.\n\nThe Recreation Centre on the Saugeen First Nation is host to activities such as Darts for meat, Karate, Fitness gym, Bingo every Monday, Ball Hockey, Volleyball, Badminton, Basketball, and dodgeball; the Recreation Centre also provides other activities for young children and teenagers.\n\nOne such program is S.Y.C.O.P.S in which group members go on trips such as whitewater rafting, and is often run in conjunction with the Toronto Police Department, Anishnabek Police and the Saugeen Recreation Center.\n\n\nThe Saugeen First Nation has a competition Pow-wow on the second weekend of August showcasing Native Dance, Handicraft, and Contemporary Native music. It is open to all spectators for a small admission. Dancers and singers compete for money. The pow-wow grounds are located at the James Mason Cultural Centre on French Bay Road.\n\n\nThe Saugeen First Nation is home to many denominations of Christianity, such as the Wesley United Church (United), Saugeen Full Gospel Church (Pentecostal), Baptist Church, Roman Catholic, The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and a small multi-denominational Church on French Bay Road.\n\nMany residents are going back to the traditional ways or co-practising Midewin and Christian religions.\n\n\nThe \"Saugeen News\", published by the band council, is a monthly newsletter sent out to all band members containing band member birthdays, events at the beach and information from community organizations such as the local Recreation Centre and the Mino Bimaadsawin Health Centre.\n\nSaugeen First Nation has no commercial media of its own, although radio and television stations from Owen Sound, Wingham, Port Elgin and Kincardine can be heard in the area.\n\nIn print, the daily \"Owen Sound Sun Times\" and the weekly \"Shoreline Beacon\" from Port Elgin also serve the community.\n\nDistant television signals from Michigan (particularly Detroit, Saginaw, Flint and Sault Ste. Marie) can sometimes also be received in the area.\n\n\n\n"}

The current MP Lucy Powell won the seat in a by-election in November 2012 on a turnout of just 18%, the lowest since the Second World War. Contrasting to this, 12 candidates stood, considerably more than the six who stood in the 1979 by-election.\n\nThe main forerunner to the seat was Manchester Cheetham, entirely taken into this area; three of five wards of former seat Manchester Exchange completed the first set of boundaries of the seat.

The 2015 general election result made the seat the eighth-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nFrom 1983-2017, Sir Gerald Kaufman, Father of the House of Commons, represented the constituency. His death in February 2017 triggered a by-election which was due to be held on 4 May 2017, but this was subsequently countermanded (that is, cancelled) after the House of Commons voted for a snap general election to be held on 8 June 2017. At that election, the Conservatives returned their lowest vote share for any seat in Great Britain, at 7.3%.\n\nSouth-East Lancashire, Gorton Division consisted of the area of the Gorton Local Board and the townships or parishes of Denton, Haughton, and Openshaw. The constituency comprised an area bounded on the west by the city of Manchester and to the east and south by the county boundary with Cheshire. In 1890, Manchester's municipal boundaries were extended to include Gorton and Openshaw, although constituency boundaries remained unchanged until 1918.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1918 reorganised parliamentary seats throughout Great Britain. The redistribution reflected the boundary changes of 1890, with Gorton becoming a division of the parliamentary borough of Manchester. The Manchester, Gorton Division comprised three wards of the county borough of Manchester: Gorton North, Gorton South and Openshaw. Denton and Haughton, which together had formed Denton Urban District in 1894, were transferred to the Mossley Division of Lancashire.\n\nThe next redrawing of English constituencies was effected by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The Act introduced the term \"borough constituency\", with Manchester Gorton Borough Constituency now consisting of four wards of the city: Gorton North, Gorton South, Levenshulme and Openshaw. Levenshulme was transferred from the abolished Manchester Rusholme seat. The revised boundaries were first used at the 1950 general election.\n\nIn 1955 boundary changes were made based on the recommendations of the Boundary Commission appointed under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. The constituency was redefined as consisting of the Gorton North and Gorton South wards of the county borough and the two neighbouring urban districts of Audenshaw and Denton in the administrative county of Lancashire. Levenshulme passed to Manchester Withington while Openshaw formed the core of a new Manchester Openshaw seat.\n\nThe 1983 redistribution of seats reflected local government reforms made in 1974. Manchester Gorton became a borough constituency in the parliamentary county of Greater Manchester. The constituency was redefined as comprising six wards of the Metropolitan district and City of Manchester, namely: Fallowfield, Gorton North, Gorton South, Levenshulme, Longsight and Rusholme. The constituency was unaltered at the next redistribution prior to the 1997 general election.\n\nFrom the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies the seat had wards (since the 2010 general election) of: Fallowfield, Gorton North, Gorton South, Levenshulme, Longsight, Rusholme and Whalley Range.\n\nIn 2018 the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) implemented changes to Manchester's electoral wards including the merging of Gorton North and Gorton South to create a new ward, Gorton and Abbey Hey.

They were not pre-qualified for the final, due to Ireland's result from the 2004 contest, which meant they took part in the semi-final on 19 May 2005.\n\nThe decision for Donna and Joe to represent Ireland was voted on by an Irish television audience and was announced on RTÉ's \"You're a Star\" on 6 March 2005. They sang \"Amazing Grace\" at an audition in Waterford to earn their place in the live national finals.\n\nThey were the first ever Irish act to take part in a Eurovision Song Contest semi-final. They went no further. They returned to Ireland and appeared as guests on \"The Podge and Rodge Show\" the following year.\n\nFollowing their brief spell in the spotlight, they were contestants on the RTÉ reality series \"Fáilte Towers\" in 2008, and guest-presented an episode of \"The Podge and Rodge Show\". Donna gained some further publicity when she declared she was a lesbian. She appeared in an RTÉ Christmas special with Katherine Lynch in 2008 and featured in an episode of \"Anonymous\" during which Bazil Ashmawy fooled her on television. Joe presents a Saturday show on Athlone Community Radio. Joe reached bootcamp in series 9 of The X Factor.\n\nDonna and Joe McCaul were born in Athlone, County Westmeath. They were raised in a family of six children. Their parents are separated and their father, Gerry, left the family when Donna and Joe were very young. Donna experienced illnesses from a young age, and had her first panic attack when she was seven. She felt claustrophobia at school. She started her career by touring in a band with Doc Carroll. Her favourite song is \"From This Moment On\" by Shania Twain. She sang at Our Lady's Bower Secondary in Athlone, and at the age of eighteen, was victorious in a competition called \"Teen Popstars\". She recorded an album of cover versions at Rosemount Studios in Moate and released it locally.\n\nThey took part in the live \"You're a Star\" finals after advancing from the Waterford auditions, where they had sung \"Amazing Grace\". Donna had auditioned for the show in Longford the year before. They reached the final where they beat County Wexford-based group Jade, which took second place in the final after a national telephone vote. The siblings were aged 13 and 16 at the time.\n\nTheir aim in the Eurovision Song Contest was to finish in the top ten at the semi-final stage, and thus qualify for the final on 21 May 2005. They had travelled in Europe to promote their song on television, taking in destinations such as Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite being unknown, Donna and Joe and the Irish audience were hoping that their lively song would appeal to voters across the Europe. However, they failed to get past the semi-final round. One media report beforehand had predicted, \"Everybody knows that the McCauls don't stand a chance, yet we're sending them over to the event in Kiev like lambs to the slaughter\". Despite this, the BBC website greeted the news with the headline \"Ireland in shock Eurovision exit\". Louis Walsh said Ireland had failed because it had sent \"two amateurs\". Former Eurovision winner Linda Martin said they were \"childish and inexperienced\" without any \"star quality\". Marty Whelan said, \"They worked their little socks off all week\" and the \"Irish Independent\" said, \"They sang and moved with a confidence beyond their years and wiggled their asses with some elan\".\nThey were so far Ireland's youngest act in Eurovision as they were 16 and 21 at that time.\n\nDonna and Joe was their stage name on the \"Eurovision Song Contest – Kiev 2005\" two-disc album. Recently the duo have been billed as simply The McCauls, although they have since begun to pursue separate careers.\n\nOn 20 February 2006, the McCauls appeared on \"The Podge and Rodge Show\" to perform their latest single. The hosts (noted for their sharp wit and cut-throat interview techniques) focused however on ridiculing the pair instead of promoting them. This saw Podge and Rodge cut to a commercial whilst Donna and Joseph sang their new song and return from the break when the song was finished. The episode was heavily criticised and later, co-host Lucy Kennedy insisted they show a recorded version of the performance, only to find Rodge had recorded lesbian kissing scenes over the tape.\n\nOn 2 August 2008, Donna and Joe appeared as a couple on the Irish reality television show \"Fáilte Towers\" broadcast on RTÉ One. The show involved celebrity members taking on different jobs each day as part of the staff of a large country hotel in Ireland. While there they encountered, among other people, fellow Eurovision entertainer, Dickie Rock, as well as a fake wedding, a nudist group and a set of Japanese tourists before \"checking out\" after being chosen to leave over \"Big Brother\" winner Brian Dowling and former Liberty X singer Michelle Heaton. Whilst in the hotel the pair managed to raise over €30,000 for their chosen charity Aware, an Irish voluntary organisation providing support to through depression. Media coverage of the pair's time in \"Fáilte Towers\" was scathing, with one report saying: \"By definition, this type of reality TV is nothing more than a springboard for wannabe celebs who have somehow scraped onto the bottom of the fame ladder\".

Mostly Conservative before 1987 (with three years of Liberal Party representation near its 1918 inception), it even resisted being gained by Labour in its massive landslide victories in 1945 and 1966. However, in 1987 the seat turned red for the first time and remained so until 2005 when it was gained by Liberal Democrat John Leech. Leech took the seat with an 18% swing – the largest of the 2005 General Election. He held it against future Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell in 2010. Amidst a UK-wide collapse in support for the Lib Dems, the seat swung back to Labour in 2015 and since 2017 has now become one of the safest Labour seats in the country, with an almost 30,000 majority for Jeff Smith.

According to the \"Manchester Evening News\" it is \"... a juxtaposition of downbeat urban terraces and the rolling Pennine hills.\"\n\n\"UK Polling Report\" describes it as \"A constituency at the eastern side of Greater Manchester, reaching from central Oldham up into the Pennines and Saddleworth Moor.\", and characterises East Oldham as \"an area of deprived terraces and racial tensions\", Shaw and Crompton as \"relatively prosperous\" and Saddleworth as composed of \"middle-class villages and hamlets\".\n\nWithin its bounds are the eastern fringes of Oldham (such as Derker, Glodwick, Greenacres, and Sholver), Shaw and Crompton, Lees, and Saddleworth (the latter of which includes the rural villages of Delph, Denshaw, Diggle, Dobcross, Greenfield and Uppermill). Between 1997 and 2010, Oldham East and Saddleworth incorporated the suburban town of Milnrow in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale when boundary changes placed it in the neighbouring Rochdale constituency.\n\nFor the 2011 by-election \"The Guardian\" described the constituency as \"[Culturally] ... a shotgun marriage [likened to] ... Coronation Street meets Last of the Summer Wine, Salford combined with Holmfirth.\"\n\nThe seat was established for the 1997 general election from parts of the former Littleborough and Saddleworth and Oldham Central and Royton constituencies. Oldham Central and Royton was a safe Labour seat whereas Littleborough and Saddleworth had had a Conservative MP, Geoffrey Dickens, from its creation until a 1995 close three-party fought by-election where it was lost to a Liberal Democrat. Ahead of the 1997 general election the seat was notionally Conservative, however since 1997 the seat has been a Labour/Liberal Democrat marginal. Although Phil Woolas of the Labour Party (defeated candidate in the mentioned 1995 by-election) was victorious in all three general elections since, his majorities have not been substantial and the Conservative vote increased from 16% to 24%.\n\nAt the 2001 general election, the far-right British National Party gained over 5,000 votes (an 11.2% share), retaining their deposit partly as Nick Griffin stood in the neighbouring West seat. Along with the BNP's showing in the neighbouring Oldham West and Royton constituency, this was interpreted as a reaction to the 2001 Oldham race riots. At the 2005 election the BNP's share of the vote dropped to 4.9%.\n\nFor the 2010 general election the seat lost the Milnrow and Newhey ward to the neighbouring Rochdale constituency and gained part of Alexandra ward from Oldham West and Royton.\n\nAfter losing the 2010 general election by 103 votes, Liberal Democrat candidate Elwyn Watkins submitted a petition for a hearing by an election court, claiming that campaign literature issued by his Labour opponent Phil Woolas breached the Representation of the People Act 1983 by making false statements about his personal character. On 5 November 2010, the election court upheld the petition and declared the election void after reporting Phil Woolas guilty of making false election statements. Woolas sought a judicial review of the decision in the Administrative Division of the High Court, which upheld the decision of the Election Court in relation to two statements, whilst quashing the decision in relation to a third. As a result, the 2011 Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election was needed. By the time it was held, the Liberal Democrats had supported an increase in tuition fees, despite a manifesto commitment to oppose any such increase. This caused a significant drop in their polling numbers nationally, but one media report nevertheless stated the seat was \"ultra-marginal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats\". The by-election took place on 13 January 2011 and was contested by ten candidates. The Labour Party candidate Debbie Abrahams won the largest percentage majority since the seat's creation before 1997.\n\n\"Chris Davies was MP for the former Littleborough and Saddleworth seat since the 1995 by-election.\"\n\n\n"}

It covers most of the western part of the borough, including Chadderton and Royton but not Failsworth which is in the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency.\n\nIn July 2006 fourteen representations were received by the Boundary Commission for England, which called for the inclusion of Chadderton in the name of the Oldham West and Royton parliamentary constituency. Many of these objectors pointed out that Chadderton was much larger and more populous than Royton. The commission rejected the proposed alternative name (Oldham West, Chadderton and Royton) because it was too long and they did not believe that there was a significant amount of support for a name change.\n\nThe present constituency was formed in 1997 from parts of the former Oldham Central and Royton and Oldham West constituencies and has to date been a safe seat for the Labour Party, having been held by Michael Meacher since the 1997 general election. Meacher had previously been the MP for the successor seat of Oldham West since 1970.\n\nDespite no part of the constituency, nor Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council ever having had a BNP councillor, the constituency gained a level of notoriety at the 2001 general election when the leader of the far-right British National Party (BNP), Nick Griffin, stood as a candidate. Griffin received 6,552 votes (a 16.4% share), beating the Liberal Democrats to third place and 524 votes behind the Conservative Duncan Reed in second. This was widely interpreted to be a reaction to the serious race riots that had occurred in Oldham (and other northern towns) a few months earlier. Because of the heightened tension, the Returning Officer took the decision not to allow any candidates to make speeches after the declaration of the results. This led to Griffin and fellow BNP candidate Michael Treacy, who ran in the neighbouring constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth, symbolically gagging themselves on the platform wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan \"Gagged for Telling the Truth\".\n\nIn local elections following the 2001 race riots, the BNP also received considerable support: specifically in the two wards of Royton North and Royton South. However, from 2008 the BNP share of the vote has been markedly lower, with BNP and former BNP candidates coming in third or fourth in Royton North and other Oldham West and Royton Wards.\n\nAt the 2005 and 2010 general elections the BNP managed to retain their deposits (polling around 7% on both occasions) but have only achieved fourth place, with the Conservative Party second behind veteran politician Michael Meacher of the Labour Party, who stood at the 2015 general election. Meacher's death in October 2015 triggered a by-election, the first of the new Parliament, which was held on 3 December 2015 and was won by Jim McMahon of the Labour Party.\n\n\n"}

However, for the remainder of the medieval period, the seat was not summoned to send an official. This changed with Henry VIII’s grant of two Members of Parliament to the town, which is believed to have been incorporated as a borough in 1246, after the issue of a charter by Henry III. At the close of the Middle Ages, in the Tudor period, Wigan was one of four boroughs in Lancashire possessing Royal Charters; the others were Lancaster, Liverpool and Preston.\n\nFollowing the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, single-member constituencies were imposed nationwide, meaning the seat saw a reduction of the number of its members.\n\nThe death of Roger Stott in office in 1999 made him the fourth Wigan MP in the twentieth century to die in office (uniquely for a constituency in the United Kingdom); the others were John Parkinson, Ronald Williams and William Foster.\n\nWigan is considered a safe seat given that it has been held by the Labour Party since 1918, with solid majorities ranging from 1,018 votes (2.2%) in 1931 to 22,643 votes (51.7%) in 1997.\n\n1832–1918: The Township of Wigan.\n\n1918–1983: The County Borough of Wigan\n\n1983–1997: The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan wards of Aspull-Standish, Beech Hill, Ince, Langtree, Newtown, Norley, Swinley, Whelley.\n\n1997–2010: The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan wards of Aspull-Standish, Beech Hill, Langtree, Newtown, Norley, Swinley, Whelley.\n\n2010–present: The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan wards of Aspull, New Springs and Whelley; Douglas; Ince; Pemberton; Shevington with Lower Ground; Standish with Langtree; Wigan Central; Wigan West.\n\nThe seat is productive and has excellent links to Manchester, as well as close links to the M6, which lies just within its western border.

A former constituency of the same name existed from 1861 to 1918. In the intervening years, the area on the Liverpool-facing side of the Wirral Peninsula was split in two and joined with other land which had become more developed.\n\nBirkenhead forms the relatively densely populated mid-east of four parliamentary constituencies within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, itself a major contributor to (and the ex-Cheshire part of) the Metropolitan County of Merseyside envisaged in 1958 and created in 1974, considered as any other county (albeit with very limited powers and no elected councillors) for the enacted purposes of the Boundary Commission in its periodic reports.\n\nThe urban parts of the town unite with Liverpool on the opposite side of the narrows of the estuary in having an early socially reformist movement in local measures and its choice of many elected representatives since the 1850s. The work was evidence in the building of large public buildings and institutions and the creation of supported workers' housing, creating Port Sunlight to the south among other such estates. The southern border of the Borough controversially avoids the near-circular suburbs of the cathedral city of Chester, thereby creating a jagged boundary in local and national government; nonetheless, the Wirral has scenic shores and large golf courses including to the west one which regularly hosts The Open. Transcending the dense 20th-century urban-semi-rural divide of Merseyside is the largely Victorian era-built town of Birkenhead, at the centre of which lies the archetype of city parks, Birkenhead Park, a social gift and early publicly subscribed community asset in the area.\n\nThe seat is almost square and bounded by its sole motorway to the west. Its homes were (at the 2011 UK Census) 53% owner-occupied compared to 60% in the region. The seat's entirely left-wing victories nationally since 1945 evidence commitment locally to public services and wealth redistribution instead of laissez-faire economics and low taxation. The 2015 general election result made the seat the fifteenth-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nBirkenhead was enfranchised in 1861 by the Birkenhead Enfranchisement Act 1861 and was a single constituency until it was split under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 1918 which took effect for the 1918 general election.\nBirkenhead East and West covered the former area between 1918-1950 and smaller neighbouring communities in The Wirral.\n\nThe single constituency on revised boundaries was re-established at the 1950 general election.\n\nThe seat's elections were won by Conservatives with one exception, the 1906 landslide victory for the Liberal Party.\n\nThe two seats alternated frequently between the three largest parties in the 1920s, before the 1931 and 1935 general elections, which saw a major Conservative and Unionist Party victory (standing as Unionist in this area) in Birkenhead West, the latter election heralding a ten-year Parliament. However, the Liberal Graham White, of the more radical faction, won the eastern seat at both elections, echoing his victory in 1922. Having had predominantly marginal majorities, the seats were firmly won by the Labour Party in their nationwide landslide victory of 1945.\n\nSince 1950, Birkenhead has returned Labour MPs each winning large majorities — apart from a 7% majority in 1955. Further to the left, two Communist candidates, including Barry Williams stood between 1950-1970 obtaining a high point of 1.5% of the votes cast during the Cold War.\n\nFrank Field, who has represented the constituency since 1979, was immediately appointed as the Blair ministry's Welfare Reform Minister for one year and has chaired the related Work and Pensions Committee since 2015.\n\n\nAt the 2001, 2005 and 2010 general elections no candidates apart from those selected by the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat parties contested the seat. Until and including the 1966 general election, three or fewer candidates generally stood in more safe-than-marginal majority-seats nationally; as is reflected the elections shown below of Birkenhead. The 2015 general election result saw the Liberal Democrat candidate fall behind the Green candidate and the parties narrowly lost their deposits.\n\nThe enfranchising Act provided that the constituency was to consist of the Extra-parochial Chapelry of Birkenhead, the several townships of Claughton, Tranmere, and Oxton, and so much of the township of Higher Bebington as lies to the eastward of the road leading from Higher Tranmere to Lower Bebington.\n\n1950–1974: The County Borough of Birkenhead, except the wards included in the Bebington constituency (i.e. the wards of Bebington, Devonshire, Egerton, Mersey, and Prenton).\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Birkenhead wards of Argyle, Bebington, Cathcart, Claughton, Cleveland, Clifton, Devonshire, Egerton, Gilbrook, Grange, Holt, Mersey, Oxton, and St James.\n\n1983–2010: The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral wards of Bidston, Birkenhead, Claughton, Egerton, Oxton, and Tranmere.\n\n2010–present: The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral wards of Bidston and St James, Birkenhead and Tranmere, Claughton, Oxton, Prenton, and Rock Ferry.\n\nThe constituency covers the town of Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula, and the Birkenhead suburbs of Bidston, Claughton, Oxton, Prenton, Rock Ferry and Tranmere.\n\n\nWhile the seat was created in 1861, it is considered a new seat for the purposes of the 1865 general election.\n\n"}

After her husband died in mysterious circumstances in 1959, the Rwandan monarchy lasted only two more years, under the leadership of \"Mwami\" Kigeli V of Rwanda and then coming to an end in 1961. However, the Queen continued to live in Butare in Butare Province, Rwanda, along with her mother and several ladies-in-waiting.\n\nOn 20 April 1994, as the Rwandan genocide began in earnest in Butare, a detachment of soldiers commanded by Lt. Pierre Bizimana, acting under the orders of Capt. Idelphonse Nizeyimana, kidnapped the former Queen along with others from her house. They then took the captives behind the National Museum and shot them. Only a younger girl survived to tell the story of the murders. Two days later, the Queen's mother was also murdered. At the request of a priest, Butare mayor Kanyabashi recovered Queen Gicanda’s body and had it buried in the yard next to her house.\n\nThe Queen was a living symbol for Tutsis, and her murder shocked many. It effectively signaled the beginning of the mass killing in the Butare area, which saw some of the worst atrocities committed during the fighting.\n\nAfter the genocide, a Rwandan military court found Bizimana and Private 1st Class Aloys Mazimpaka guilty of genocide and the murder of Queen Gicanda and her family. (\"Chambre Specialisée du Conseil de Guerre de Butare, case no. LMD 187, LP 0001-PS 97\", Judgment pronounced July 27, 1998.) Bizimana was sentenced to death, Mazimpaka to life in prison.\n\nOn 6 October 2009, former intelligence chief Idelphonse Nizeyimana was arrested in Kampala, Uganda. Nizeyimana was one of the most wanted suspects in the Rwandan genocide. On 19 June 2012, he was convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda of ordering the killing of the former Tutsi queen, as well as other murders, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n"}

Bonar Law would later serve as UK Prime Minister from 1922–23, but no longer represented Bootle in the House of Commons. James Burnie of the Liberal Party held the seat from 1922–24, and the seat was briefly held by John Kinley from the Labour Party from 1929–31 and became a Conservative – Labour marginal in the 1930s when the mainstream Labour party went into National Coalition. The Labour Party has held it continuously since the 1945 general election; this period saw two decades of steep decline in the profitability of Liverpool Docks, manufacturing and shipbuilding, which employed many constituents. At the three general elections from and including 1997, Bootle was the safest seat for any party in the United Kingdom by percentage of majority.\n\nIn 1990, two by-elections were held in Bootle. The first followed the death of Allan Roberts on 21 February, and was held on 24 May. Jack Holmes, the candidate of the continuing Social Democratic Party (representing the faction of the party which did not merge with the Liberal Democrats) was beaten by Screaming Lord Sutch of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, contributing to the end of the SDP. The victorious Labour candidate, Michael Carr unexpectedly died on 20 July 1990 after just 57 days in office.\n\nThe second by-election, held on 8 November 1990, was won by the Labour candidate, Joe Benton. Benton retained Bootle at the next four general elections with large majorities. At the 2005 general election, the seat was the safest seat by percentage of majority and had the highest winning share of the vote. In June 2014, Benton announced that he would retire at the 2015 general election.\n\nThe 2015 result made the seat the fifth-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority (with a winning vote share of 74.5% and a majority of 63.6%).\n\nThe seat has some small neighbourhoods with middle-to-high incomes, but generally residents have some of the lowest UK incomes and there is a higher-than-average proportion of social housing. The Bootle constituency has long been one of the safest seats in the United Kingdom and since 1945, has given a majority of votes cast to the Labour Party at each general election. Since 1964, the size of the majority (by vote share) has been in double digits; since 1992, it has been over 50%, peaking at 74.4.% in the 1997 Blair landslide election. However, the Labour vote share was at its highest in 2017, when Peter Dowd received 84% of votes cast. Both the size of the majority and the share of the vote represent an unbeaten record for this constituency.\n\n1885–1918: The Boroughs of Bootle-cum-Linacre and Liverpool, the parishes of Childwall, Fazakerley, Walton-on-the-Hill, and Wavertree, and parts of the parishes of Toxteth Park and West Derby.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Bootle.\n\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Bootle, and the Urban District of Litherland.\n\n1955–1974: As 1918.\n\n1974–1983: As 1950.\n\n1983–1997: The Metropolitan Borough of Sefton wards of Church, Derby, Ford, Linacre, Litherland, Netherton, Orrell, and St Oswald.\n\n1997–2010: As above less Church ward.\n\n2010–present: The Metropolitan Borough of Sefton wards of Church, Derby, Ford, Linacre, Litherland, Netherton and Orrell, St Oswald, and Victoria.\n\nThe constituency covers the southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside. This comprises Bootle itself plus other localities including Crosby, Waterloo, Seaforth, Litherland, Netherton, Orrell and Ford.\n\nBoundary changes that came into force as a result of the 2010 general election being called saw the constituency grow to also include parts of the old Crosby constituency, with the electoral wards of Church and Victoria being added. Although these areas are more affluent than some parts of Bootle, it has not changed the seat from being anything other than a safe Labour one.\n\nGeneral Election 1914/15:\n\nAnother General Election was required to take place before the end of 1915.

{"id": "1811282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811282", "title": "Wirral West (UK Parliament constituency)", "text": "Wirral West (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nWirral West is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. In 2017, with 55,377 people eligible to vote, Wirral West had the smallest electorate of any constituency in England. The current MP is Margaret Greenwood of the Labour Party.\n\nThe present Wirral West constituency was created in 1983, from the northern part of the former Wirral constituency. Its predecessor had traditionally elected Conservative MPs. \n\nFrom 1945-76, the MP was Selwyn Lloyd, who served as Foreign Secretary during the Eden ministry and as Chancellor of the Exchequer during the Macmillan ministry, later becoming Speaker of the Commons in 1971 before being raised to the peerage in 1976. The ensuing by-election was won by David Hunt, who became the first MP for the newly created constituency of Wirral West in 1983. Hunt was a member of John Major's Cabinet, serving twice as Secretary of State for Wales and also as Secretary of State for Employment.\n\nHunt held the seat until 1997, when he lost to Stephen Hesford of the Labour Party. Labour narrowly retained the seat in 2005, despite a challenge from former TV presenter Esther McVey, standing as the candidate for the Conservative Party.\n\nHesford announced on 22 January 2010 that he would be stepping down at the next general election for family reasons. Boundary changes in 2010 meant that his majority would have been reversed and the Conservatives would have won the seat at the previous election by 569 votes. At the 2010 general election, McVey won the seat for the Conservatives with a swing of 2.3% from the Labour Party.\n\nWirral West has been described as a bellwether, with results in the constituency mirroring the national result at every general election since its formation in 1983 until 2015. However at the 2015 general election, Wirral West was gained by Labour, despite the Conservatives winning the general election to form the first majority Conservative government in 23 years. This was also in spite of the Conservative Party increasing their popular vote and vote share in the constituency, with the Liberal Democrat turnout collapse benefiting Labour. Wirral West, like the nearby City of Chester, was one of the few Conservative-held marginals outside of London to be gained by Labour at that election.\n\n1983–2010: The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral wards of Hoylake, Prenton, Royden, Thurstaston, and Upton.\n\n2010–present: The Metropolitan Borough of Wirral wards of Greasby, Frankby and Irby, Hoylake and Meols, Pensby and Thingwall, Upton, and West Kirby and Thurstaston.\n\nThe constituency is one of four covering the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. It contains the towns of Hoylake and West Kirby, as well as areas such as Greasby, Thingwall, Irby, Meols, Upton and Woodchurch.\n\nIn the 2005 Boundary Commission report, Wirral West lost part of the Prenton ward to the Birkenhead constituency, and gained part of Barnston from Wirral South.\n\n"}

He had ousted the Labour party candidate from Bebington and Ellesmere Port in 1979 which he held until the election in 1983. Following the death of Porter in late 1996, a by-election was held in February 1997, the last by-election of that Parliament, held a matter of weeks before the general election was called. It was won by Ben Chapman (Lab), who held the seat until retiring following controversy over his expenses. Labour narrowly managed to hold on in the 2010 general election, electing Alison McGovern. She increased her majority to 4,599 in the 2015 election. She was re-elected in 2017 with a majority of 8,323, an increase of 7% over 2015, the biggest majority Labour has ever held in the seat and the biggest majority for any party in Wirral South since 1987.\n\nSince its creation in 1983, the constituency has consisted of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral wards of Bebington, Bromborough, Clatterbridge, Eastham, and Heswall.\n\nThe constituency is one of four covering the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, covering the south of the borough.

Alison McGovern was the sitting Member of Parliament for the Labour Party. The Conservative Party selected John Bell. Bell had previously stood for election in Clwyd South (2010) and Delyn (2005). He had also stood twice to be a Welsh Assembly Member. He stood in a local council by-election in 2011, for Wrexham County Council.\n\n \n\n\n"}
