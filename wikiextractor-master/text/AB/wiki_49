{"id": "1976258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976258", "title": "Mureybet", "text": "Mureybet\n\nMureybet () is a tell, or ancient settlement mound, located on the west bank of the Euphrates in Raqqa Governorate, northern Syria. The site was excavated between 1964 and 1974 and has since disappeared under the rising waters of Lake Assad. Mureybet was occupied between 10,200 and 8,000 BC and is the eponymous type site for the Mureybetian culture, a subdivision of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA). In its early stages, Mureybet was a small village occupied by hunter-gatherers. Hunting was important and crops were first gathered and later cultivated, but they remained wild. During its final stages, domesticated animals were also present at the site.\n\nThe first archaeological investigation of the site was carried out in 1964. In that year, the site was noted during an archaeological survey of the region directed by Maurits N. van Loon of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and a small sounding was made. In 1965, a more extensive excavation was carried out, again under the direction of Van Loon. Between 1971 and 1974, work on the site was resumed by a team of the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) directed by Jacques Cauvin. All excavations were part of the larger international – and eventually UNESCO-coordinated – effort to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible in the area that would be flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam, which was being built at that time. The filling of Lake Assad eventually led to the flooding of Mureybet in 1976. Although the site is now submerged and no longer accessible, the material that has been retrieved during the excavations continues to generate new research. This material is currently stored at the National Museum of Aleppo and the Institute de Préhistoire Orientale in Jalès-Berrias in France.\n\nMureybet is located in modern-day Raqqa Governorate in northern Syria. It is situated on an elongated ridge that is c. above the river terrace of the Euphrates, which flowed directly west of the site before the valley was flooded. Mureybet is a tell, or ancient settlement mound, measuring in diameter and high.\n\nClimate and environment of Mureybet during the time of its occupation were very different from the modern situation. When Mureybet became occupied around 10,200 BC, climate was slightly colder and more humid than today, an effect of the onset of the Younger Dryas climate change event. Annual precipitation increased slightly from during the Natufian to during the Mureybetian occupation phases. The vegetation consisted of an open forest steppe with species like terebinth, almond and wild cereals.\n\nThe excavations have revealed four occupation phases I–IV, ranging from the Natufian up to the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) and dating to 10,200–8,000 BC, based on AMS radiocarbon dates. Phase IA (10,200–9,700 BC) represents the Natufian occupation of Mureybet. It is characterized by hearths and cooking pits, but no dwelling structures have been identified. Among the crops that were harvested, and possibly even locally cultivated, were barley and rye. Very few sickle blades and querns were found. The inhabitants of Mureybet hunted gazelle and equids and fishing was also important. They had dogs, evidence for which is indirect at Mureybet but bones of which have been identified at nearby and contemporary Tell Abu Hureyra.\n\nPhases IB, IIA and IIB (9,700–9,300 BC) make up the Khiamian, a poorly understood and sometimes disputed sub-phase straddling the transition from the Natufian to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA). Mureybet is the only site where Khiamian deposits are associated with architectural remains. The oldest of these remains date to phase IB and consist of a round semi-subterranean structure with a diameter of . In the subsequent phases, slightly smaller round houses built at ground level also appeared, at least some of which were used simultaneously. The walls were built from compacted earth, sometimes reinforced with stones. Hearths and cooking pits were located outside the buildings. Harvested crops included barley, rye and \"Polygonum\". Sickle blades and grinding stones are more common and show more use-wear, indicating that cereals became a more important component in the diet. The fauna at Mureybet changed significantly during phase IIB. Gazelle makes up 70% of the assemblage and small animals decrease in importance, although fish remained important. Toward the end of the Khiamian, equid hunting gained importance at the expense of gazelle.\nPhases IIIA and IIIB (9,300–8,600 BC) represent the Mureybetian, a subphase of the PPNA that was named after Mureybet and is found in the area of the Middle Euphrates. Architecture diversified, with rectangular, multi-cellular buildings appearing next to the round buildings that were already known from the previous phases. Walls were built from cigar-shaped stones that were created by percussion and that were covered with earth. Semi-subterranean structures also continued to be used and they are compared to similar structures found at nearby and contemporary Jerf el-Ahmar, where the structures are interpreted as special buildings with a communal function. Many rooms in the rectangular structures were so small that they could only have served for storage. Hearths and cooking pits lined with stones continued to be located in the outdoor areas. The wild varieties of barley, rye and einkorn were consumed in phase III. Different lines of evidence suggest that these cereals were cultivated rather than gathered. Hunting of equids and aurochs was more important than of gazelle, while fish remains were rare in phase III contexts. Based on use-wear analysis, it could also be established that animal hides were processed at the site using bone and stone tools. The earliest known writing for record keeping evolved from a system of counting using small clay tokens. The earliest use of small clay tokens for counting were found in phase III. It coincided with a period of explosive rapid growth of the use of cereals in the Near East.\n\nThe last occupation phases, IVA (8,600–8,200 BC) and IVB (8,200–8,000 BC) date to the Early and Middle PPNB, respectively. No architecture has been encountered in phase IVA. No domesticated cereals were found, but this may be an effect of very small archaeobotanical sample that was retrieved from these phases. Hunting focused on equids, followed by aurochs. It could not be determined whether any domesticated animals were exploited in Mureybet. Mud-built walls of rectangular structures were uncovered in phase IVB. Domesticated sheep and goat were exploited in this period, and domesticated cattle may also have been present.\n\nThe excavation of Mureybet has produced an abundance of lithic material. During all periods, flint was the main raw material from which tools were made. It was procured from local sources. Obsidian was much less common. Natufian tools include points, burins, scrapers, borers and \"herminettes\", a kind of tool that was primarily used for woodwork. Flint arrowheads appeared in the Khiamian period. Other stone tools included burins, end-scrapers and borers. Mureybetian stone tools included Mureybet arrowheads, scrapers and burins, while borers were much less common. During the PPNB phase, Byblos arrowheads replaced the Mureybetian types, and other technological improvements were also introduced.\n\nApart from the lithics, other artefact categories were also present in Mureybet in smaller quantities. Personal ornaments in the Natufian period consisted of pierced shells and small stone and shell discs. Only a few bone tools were found. During the Khiamian, bone was used for needles, awls and axe sheaths. Beads were made from stone, freshwater shells and bone. Among the three figurines from this phase was one with clear anthropomorphic characteristics. The Mureybetian bone tool assemblage closely resembled its Khiamian predecessor. The presence of baskets at Mureybet has been inferred from use-wear analysis on flint and bone tools. Other artifact categories include limestone vessels, stone querns, beads, pendants, including one from ivory and eight anthropomorphic figurines made from limestone and baked earth. Seven of these figurines could be identified as women.\n\n\n\n"}

The Mondini dysplasia describes a cochlea with incomplete partitioning and a reduced number of turns, an enlarged vestibular aqueduct and a dilated vestibule. A normal cochlea has two and a half turns, a cochlea with Mondini dysplasia has one and a half turns; the basal turns being normally formed with a dilated or cystic apical turn to the cochlear. The hearing loss can deteriorate over time either gradually or in a step-wise fashion, or may be profound from birth.\n\nHearing loss associated with Mondini dysplasia may first become manifest in childhood or early adult life. Some children may pass newborn hearing screen to lose hearing in infancy but others present with a hearing loss at birth. Hearing loss is often progressive and because of the associated widened vestibular aqueduct may progress in a step-wise fashion associated with minor head trauma. Vestibular function is also often affected. While the hearing loss is sensorineural a conductive element may exist probably because of the third window effect of the widened vestibular aqueduct. The Mondini dysplasia can occur in cases of Pendred Syndrome and Branchio-oto-renal syndrome and in other syndromes, but can occur in non-syndromic deafness.\n"}

It is in the north-central portion of the municipality, located a short distance from the town of Dresden.\n\nIn 1837, William Taylor and James Smith erected a saw, grist and wool mill on the banks of the Sydenham River in Camden Township of Kent County, Ontario near Dresden, Ontario. The mills were welcomed by residents at Dawn Mills who previously had to transport their produce for milling to Detroit by canoe. An early road was built here near the Sydenham River which connected the mill settlements.\n\nThe town grew to six streets, three hotels, church and a store. The population was around 100.\n\nIn the 1860s a railway system was constructed in southern Ontario. Stations were built, and tracks were laid at the bigger (and also purpose-established) towns. As had many other communities the region, Dawn Mills lost industries to competition from larger milling enterprises elsewhere. By the early 1900s Dawn Mills became a ghost town. The post office closed in 1918.\n\nThe church in Dawn Mills still stands, purchased by a Mennonite in the 1990s. The building was built as a Methodist church. It became a United Church and part of the Dawn Mills Pastoral Charge (comprising Dawn Mills, Wabash and Lindsay Road United Churches) in 1925, after church union. The charge was discontinued in 1968, and the building was sold to Dawn Mills community members for $1. The Dawn Mills Good Will Workers held regular meetings and social events there for a number of years. The hall was also rented out for family birthday parties, community wedding showers, etc.\n\nThe Old Colony Mennonite Church first rented, and later purchased the church building.

{"id": "1976296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976296", "title": "Senjak", "text": "Senjak\n\nSenjak (; ) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital city of Serbia. Located in Savski Venac, one of the three municipalities that constitute the very center of the city, it is an affluent and distinguished neighborhood lavished with embassies, diplomatic residences, and mansions. Senjak is generally considered one of the wealthiest parts of Belgrade.\n\nBefore it became interesting to Belgrade's upper classes, Senjak was an excellent natural lookout. As many farmers kept their hay throughout the entire city, fires were quite frequent, so it was ordered for hay to be collected and kept in one place, and the area of modern Senjak was chosen, apparently also getting its name in the process (from the word \"seno\", Serbian for hay). Also, the hay for army horses was kept here in the late 19th century. A more romantic theory of the neighborhood's name (from the word \"sena\", Serbian for 'shade' or 'shadow') developed later.\n\nOn the east, Senjak was bounded by the Topčider Road, which connected downtown Belgrade to the forests of Košutnjak and Topčider. The road section on the northern slope, between Senjak and western part of Točidersko Brdo, is today named Bulevar Vojvode Putnika. This section of the street was embellished with the quadruple chestnut avenue in the late 19th century. Southern section, which swerved around Senjak, was embellished with the avuenue of poplars. Senjak and the neighboring Topčidersko Brdo are today quite wooded for the urban areas. This is the result of the 1923 Belgrade's general plan. One of the main projects regarding the green areas was forestation of the hill, formation of the new park and establishment of the continuous green area with the Topčider Park. Project started in 1926 while the Hyde Park was finished in the 1930s. Today, the continuous Topčider-Košutnjak parks and forests make the largest \"green massif\" in the immediate vicinity of Belgrade's urban tissue.\n\nThe settlement began to form around the tobacco factory, which was built before World War I. Several hundred of houses and hovels were built around the factory, mostly by the factory workers. Soon, workers from the neighboring industrial facilities along the Topčider Road, including the State Postage Stamp Printing Office (\"Markarnica\"), railway workers, etc. The workers settlement developed mostly along the road to the old quarry. At the time, the hill was known for the greenery and abundant fruit production, mainly apricots, grapes and figs. Lower classes had various advantages living in Senjak at the time: their workplaces were close when the public transportation grid wasn't that much developed, the costs of living outside of the city were lower, they could grow their food and fruits, there was a direct tram line to downtown and the railway also passed through the settlement.\n\nThe tobacco factory was destroyed by the Austro-Hungarian bombing of Belgrade in 1914 and wasn't rebuilt after the war. This left room for numerous workers houses to be demolished, too, and they were massively being sold due to the increased prices of the land. Instead, many villas were built by the most affluent Belgrade families. Senjak became one of the neighborhoods of Belgrade with most striking difference between social classes. Top of the Senjak Hill was occupied by the most lavish private houses in the city, while the edges and areas below the hill were among the most desolate parts of Belgrade (Prokop, Jatagan Mala).\n\nDuring the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia, a number of buildings in the neighborhood such as the Swiss ambassador's residence were damaged or affected by the conflict.\n\nThe first tram link established in Belgrade was from the Kalemegdan fortress to Senjak.\n\nSenjak is located 3 km south-west of downtown Belgrade, on top of the hilly cliff-like crest of the western slopes of Topčidersko Brdo, overlooking Belgrade Fair right below and the Sava river (from which, at the closest point, Senjak is only 100 meters away). It borders the neighborhoods of Topčider and Careva Ćuprija (south), Mostar (north), Prokop and Dedinje (east). The triangularly shaped neighborhood has many smaller streets but it is bounded by two wide boulevards, named after Serbian army vojvodas from World War I: Vojvoda Mišić and Vojvoda Putnik.\n\nFrom June 1945 to December 1946, Senjak was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VII.\n\nSenjak originally belonged to the former municipality of Topčidersko Brdo, which in 1957 merged with the municipality of Zapadni Vračar to create the municipality of Savski Venac. Senjak existed as the local community within Savski Venac with the population of 3,690 in 1981. It was later merged into the new local community of Topčidersko Brdo-Senjak which had a population of 7,757 in 1991, 7,249 in 2002 and 6,344 in 2011.\n\nJust like the neighboring Dedinje, Senjak is generally considered among Belgraders as one of the richest neighborhoods in the city. After 1945, it shared much of the same fate as Dedinje: when Communists took over, they declared almost all former residents as state enemies and forced them out of their mansions, so the new Communist political and military elite moved in. Some measures in removing the former high class were brutal as only those who fled the country stayed alive. Those unlucky were taken into a nearby woods and shot, with their remains lying in unmarked graves for decades until they were exposed by construction workers clearing trees for a new soccer field.\n\n\"Bulevar vojvode Mišića\", encircles Senjak from the north, west and south and separates it from the Belgrade Fair, Careva Ćuprija and Topčider. As of 2017, it was the street with the busiest traffic in Belgrade: 8,000 vehicles per hour in one direction during the morning rush hour.\n\nIn 2019, Branislav Mitrović, architect and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, said that \"caricatural architecture, inept compilations and stylish nonsenses\" turned once respectable residential neighborhood of Senjak, so as Neimar and Dedinje, into chaos.\n\nKing Peter's House\n\nA vacant summer house of King Peter I Karađorđević. The house stands across the soccer field of \"FK Grafičar\" and close to the building of the military academy. The house, called the \"White villa\", was built in 1896 and it belonged to the merchant Živko Pavlović. In 1919 the state, represented by the Ministry of education, leased the house for the king who lived there from 1919 to his death in 1921. Monthly rent was 3,000 dinars in silver. The king lived quite modestly. His own room was equipped with bed, small cabinet with the sink, locker, lamp, sable and chandelier. The king had his own library, with the books printed by the Srpska književna zadruga. He spent lots of time on the vast terrace and in the garden. After king's death in August 1921, the Royal Intendancy bought the house out in order to make it a museum. In the 1930s it was declared a king's memorial-house.\n\nAfter 1945 residents changed and mostly included the high-ranking members of the new Communist elite and in that period majority of the exhibited artifacts, the legacy of the king, were either destroyed od taken away. Missing items include the king's death mask and the only remaining artifact was the king's bed. In 1945 the house was adapted into the elementary school which was closed in 1951 and the house, for the most part since then, remained abandoned and left to the elements. In 2010 the house was adapted into the cultural center. Within the house, a memorial room for the king was set, which includes a mosaic of 100 photographs of the king and his family.\n\nIn the house's yard, there are two trees, protected by the law since 1998. One is a 20 meters high gingko and the other is a 10 meters high magnolia tree. As of 2017, both trees are estimated at being 110 years old.\n\nOther buildings\n\n\n\nThe slope above the modern Belgrade Fair complex was known as the Đurđevo Brdo. Before World War II it was known as one of the suburban slums, with bad communal infrastructure. The neighborhood developed in the first decade after World War I, after 1919, in the area outside of the jurisdiction of the city construction rules. It was a workers' settlement, mainly inhabited by the workers on the railroad who either rented rooms or built their own shanty houses. By the 1921 general urban city plan, it was labeled as one of the \"scarce settlements\", which formed a suburban ring around Belgrade. A Society for Arrangement of Đurđevo Brdo and Topčidersko Brdo was founded by 1923. In the mid 1930s it had some 150 houses and a population of 600, still being classified as the shanty town with small buildings and houses with yards. The name disappeared from the city maps after World War II, when all separately developed neighborhoods grew urbanely into one called Senjak.\n\nGospodarska Mehana () is the westernmost section of Senjak. It occupies the slopes descending to the Sava, just across the southern end of the Belgrade Fair and north of the Topčiderka's mouth into the Sava. It was named after the famed, and one of the longest surviving kafana in Belgrade, \"Gospodarska mehana\". Kafana was founded in 1820 in what was at the time the end of the city. Due to the construction of the Ada Bridge, access roads to it and a loop interchange, the kafana was cut off and had to be closed in September 2013, after 193 years.\n\nIn 1821, the state government decided to put the food trade in order and to establish the quantity and quality of the goods imported to the city. Part of the project was introduction of the excise on the goods (in Serbian called \"trošarina\") and setting of a series of excise check points on the roads leading to the city. One of those check points, which all gradually also became known as \"trošarina\", was located here as in the 1830s and 1840s it was a location of the ferry which transported pigs across the Sava into the Austria. This \"trošarina\" also functioned as a customs house. In 1859 when prince Miloš Obrenović and his son Mihailo Obrenović returned to Serbia, they landed at Gospodarska Mehana. It was the final stop of the first Belgrade's tram line and still is on the important traffic route with important streets (Boulevard of Vojvoda Mišić, Radnička Street), railway, public transportation lines (still surviving tram line), road elevation which connects Banovo Brdo and Čukarica with Belgrade (formerly known as the \"Gospodarska Mehana elevation\"), etc. In the 1930s, when most of Belgrade's upper class built houses in Dedinje, some decided to build houses in Gospodarska Mehana, including then Prime minister of Yugoslavia, Milan Stojadinović.\n\nSlope right above the Gospodarska Mehana is called \"Rajsova padina\" (Reiss’ Slope), named after Archibald Reiss, Swiss forensics pioneer who lived in Senjak after moving to Serbia when the World War I ended. In May 2011, as part of the project of foresting the city and creating a green barrier against traffic from the interchange and the roads, 400 trees were planted on Rajsova padina, including cedar, pedunculate oak, Cypress oak and Siberian elm. Total forested area covers an area of .\n\nIn the mid-19th century, northern part of modern Senjak was a meadow, with only the Topčider road passing through. It was used as the training ground for the army and as the pasture for the sheep. Czech émigré Smutek, who owned a kafana, arranged a large estate and a beautiful garden in the area, which then became known as Smutekovac. It became a popular excursion site for the Belgraders, which originally came by fiacres and later by the tram \"Topčiderac\", which connected the downtown with Topčider. In the 1870s the area was parceled and Đorđe Vajfert purchased the land from the lawyer Pera Marković. As he was a German subject, he couldn't own properties in Serbia. Instead he paid the entire sum to Marković who issued him a receipt. Vajfert then started to build the brewery, predecessor of the modern BIP brewery at the same location. As soon as he was granted Serbian citizenship, Vajfert received a deed on the land. He finished the brewery and turned the surrounding estate into an exquisite garden, which hosted many banquets and parties. In 1892, city authorities organized a banquet with Nikola Tesla as the guest of honor.\n\nThe neighborhood developed in the first decade after World War I, in the area outside of the jurisdiction of the city construction rules. It developed after 1919 south of Đurđevo Brdo, in the direction of the Sugar Refinery and Čukarica further to the south. In the mid 1930s it had some 50 houses and a population of 200, still being classified as the shanty town with small buildings and houses with yards.\n\nThe bank of the Sava river at Gospodarska Mehana was the most popular Belgrade's beach during the Interbellum. The beach was known as the \"Šest Topola\" (\"Six Poplars\") and especially boomed after 1933 when other beaches were closed. Just like other smaller location, it was equipped with the swimming (bathing) pools with wooden floors. It had separate bathing pools for men, women and children. The first water polo matches in Belgrade were held at \"Šest Topola\" between World Wars. After World War II, the new Communist authorities considered such bathing places relicts of the old regime and wanted to make leisure more approachable for the lower classes, so in time they switched to forming proper beaches along the rivers instead of the bathing centers.\n\nSo, in time, the neighboring Ada Ciganlija became the top excursion site. The name of \"Šest Topola\" is preserved in the name of the restaurant on the Sava's bank within the complex of the Belgrade Fair. Designed by architect Milorad Pantović, it was opened on 23 August 1957. For a while after 1964, it was part of the Hospitality Educational Center.\n\n"}

She previously headed Department of Environment from 1997 to 2005, making her the first female member in the cabinet of Iran since 1979 and the third in history. She held the same level of office from 2013 to 2017.\n\nEbtekar first achieved fame as \"Mary\", the spokeswoman of the “students” who took hostages and occupied the US Embassy in 1979. Later she became the head of the Environment Protection Organization of Iran during the administration of President Mohammad Khatami, and was a city councilwoman of Tehran from 2007 to 2013.\n\nEbtekar was born in Tehran as Masoumeh, Niloufar Ebtekar in a middle-class family. Her first name translates to \"Innocent Water Lily\" in English. Ebtekar's father studied at the University of Pennsylvania, and she lived with her parents in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia. During her six years in Philadelphia, she developed \"near-perfect, American-accented English.\" Returning to Iran she enrolled in Iranzamin (Tehran International School). Later after graduation as a student, she became a supporter of the political Islam of Ali Shariati and began wearing a traditional black chador covering everything except her face.\n\nEbtekar holds a BSc degree in laboratory science from Shahid Beheshti University, a MSc and PhD in immunology from Tarbiat Modares University in 1995, where she still teaches. Ebtekar is married to Seyyed Mohammad Hashemi who is a businessman in the private sector. They have two children.\n\nEbtekar has served as faculty member at Tarbiat Modares University, which is a postgraduate academic center located in Tehran. As an Associate Professor in Immunology, she has taught, supervised and advised PhD and MSc students. Ebtekar currently teaches cytokines, viral immunology, HIV vaccines, aging, immunology of the nervous system and psychoneuroimmunology. She has currently filed 66 ISI scientific articles in the field of immunology in Scopus in her name. In her speech to the Eleventh International Congress of Immunology in Tehran, she mentioned the detrimental effect of sanctions on the advancement of science in Iran and noted that sanctions should not be directed against nations. Ebtekar is a member of several research board committees and a reviewer for two international and four national immunology journals.\nEbtekar was promoted to full Professorship in Jan 2019 and elected as Immunology & Allergy Association in 2018.\n\nOn 7 October 2008, eTBLAST, a text similarity search engine on MEDLINE database, noted that 85% of a paper published by Masoumeh Ebtekar came from several previously published articles. The paper, on cytokines and air pollution, was published in 2006 in the \"Iran Journal of Allergy Asthma Immunology\" (IJAAI) 5 47-56:2006. A couple weeks after the eTBLAST report, \"Nature\" covered the story, quoting one of the authors of original papers, (Ian Mudway, a toxicologist at the King's College London) as saying, \"the article is a veritable patchwork of other people's work, word for word, grammatical error for grammatical error.\" \"Nature\" also stated that Ebtekar had not replied to its emails. In response, the editor-in-chief of the IJAAI issued a statement saying: \"We regret for this duplication that appeared in the journal. We are working with the editors of the JACI journal [the \"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\", a scholarly periodical that published three of the papers from which Ebtekar had copied] to find the best solution in this regard.\" In December 2008 Ebtekar's article was retracted.\n\nThe issue received some political and public attention in Iran. Ebtekar issued a statement admitting she had made a mistake and apologizing for it, but including a list of complaints such as eTBLAST's failure to inform her of their finding in advance, the fact that the article was a review article she was invited to write for the Journal, and that more than 76 references were given in the text.\n\nIn 2013 Ebtekar was elected as the President of the 12th International Congress of Immunology. The Congress was held on April 29, 2014. Ebtekar spoke in the opening ceremony and introduced Rolf Zinkernagel, the Nobel Laureate for Medicine, as the guest of honour.\n\nIn 1981, Ebtekar became the editor-in-chief of the English daily newspaper \"Kayhan International\", selected by Khatami who was then the representative of Ayatollah Khomeini in Kayhan Institute. She served in the newspaper until 1983. In 1991 she co-founded the Institute for Women's Studies and Research. Since 1992, she has been the license holder and managing director of the journal \"Farzaneh Journal for Women's Studies and Research\". Ebtekar was appointed as the Head of Women's NGO Coordinating Office and Vice Head of the National Committee to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Later, she was elected as the President of the Network of Women's NGOs in Iran.\n\nEbtekar served as spokeswoman for the students in the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, where Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line occupied the US Embassy and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Selected because of her good command of English, she made regular appearances on American television as translator and spokeswoman for the students, where she presented the official positions of the students. She was referred to as \"Mary\" by foreign press, and \"Tiger Lily\" by the hostages, a play on the translation of \"Niloufar\".\n\nEbtekar wrote an account of the embassy takeover with Fred A. Reed titled \"Takeover in Tehran: The Inside Story of the 1979 U.S. Embassy Capture\". Western media have systematically depicted Ebtekar's involvement in a negative manner, as Reed describes: \"For twenty years the prevailing \"globalized\" version of the embassy capture has cast the students at best as well-intentioned but naive young people manipulated ...and at worst as irresponsible extremists.\" Elaine Sciolino wrote about Ebtekar's own viewpoint: \"Asked by an \"ABC News\" correspondent one day whether she could see herself picking up a gun and killing the hostages, she replied: 'yes. When I've seen an American gun being lifted up and killing my brothers and sisters in the streets, of course.'\"\nShe is said to be remembered by many Americans (hostages such as David Roeder, Barbara Timm, the mother of hostage Kevin Hermening and those who watched her on television) with a great lack of fondness, in part because \"her familiarity with America added profound emphasis to her rejection of it.\"\nWhen asked by an American interviewer (Elaine Sciolino) in the late 1990s about her past as spokeswoman for the hostage-takers, why it did not appear on her resume, and why she had changed her name from Niloufar to Masoumeh, Ebtekar \"had no apology and made no excuses\" about her role, describing the hostage taking as \"the best direction that could have been taken\" by Iran at the time, but surprised the interviewer with her \"chutzpah\", insisting that the interviewer \"not write much about these things.\" Sciolino published this article in the \"New York Times\" unaware of the fact that Ebtekar's book (Takeover in Tehran) was in print and would be published in 2001.\n\nShe held office as the deputy to Shahla Habibi, head of the 'Bureau of Women's Affairs' under administration Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in the 1990s, and was reportedly the \"main driving-force\" behind the office.\n\nIn the 2012 film \"Argo\", Ebtekar was portrayed by Nikka Far and called only \"Tehran Mary\" in the credits.\n\nEbtekar was the first woman to serve as Vice-President of Iran when the reformists came to power. Along with Zahra Shojaei, she participated in the first cabinet since the Islamic Revolution to include women. She has been described as a leftist in Mohammad Khatami's alliance. Ebtekar headed the Department of Environment for eight years, introducing major structural, organizational and directional changes enabling a re-engineering of the government body. During her tenure environmental awareness and support for civil society activism in this area was enhanced.\n\nEbtekar's appointment led to the revelation of her past, and in the US questions were raised about whether President Khatami was aware of \"how deeply\" the hostage-taking and holding, and anger towards its foremost public defender, \"affected both the American government and the American people.\" Many academics and literary critiques have written and expressed their views on her published memoirs. Following this, \"some ambassadors\" in Tehran reportedly stated they would no \"longer meet with her\" and would \"discourage official contract with her office.\" In her memoirs published as the \"Grapes of Shahrivar\", Ebtekar repeatedly refers to her cordial and official contacts with not only Western Ambassadors, but also many European Ministers and Presidents as well. (chapters 8-16-23-26-30-32-33)\n\nOn International Women's Day in 1998, as vice-president of environmental affairs, she made a speech condemning the oppression of women by the Taliban Movement in Afghanistan. Her performance caused comment by members of the Western news media in attendance as she herself was wearing a chador, a reminder of compulsory hijab in Iran which many in the West view as a violation of women's rights.\n\nIn March 2002, Ebtekar was a keynote speaker at the Meeting of Women Leaders on the Environment in Helsinki, sponsored by the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. In September 2002, Ebtekar participated in the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa. In May 2005, she chaired the International Conference on Environment, Peace, and the Dialogue Among Civilizations and Cultures, held in Tehran. This event was organized by Ebtekar's Department of the Environment and also by the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nEbtekar served as Vice President and Head of the Department of Environment during the first term of President Rouhani, 2013–2017. During this period in spite of immense challenges facing Iran's environment, and irrespective of the fierce opposition of rival political and special interests groups, great strides were taken to enhance environmental governance and stewardship. Twelve environmental bills, a strong chapter in the sixth National Development Plan and numerous directives and guidelines were implemented during this period, while national plans to enhance air quality were promoted through strong cross-sectoral, management leading to better air quality trends.\n\nThe national Low Carbon Economy Strategy was adopted; the Cabinet adopted its INDC and the Paris Agreement, which the Parliament also adopted. This led to important strides in renewable energy including more than 500 MW of new solar plants and much more underway. Restoration of wetlands according to ecosystem management schemes and local community participation was undertaken leading to revival of Houralazim wetland, designation of Hamoun as a Biosphere reserve and improvement of conditions in Urmia Lake and many other wetlands across Iran.\n\nA major campaign to enhance environment education, inclusion of 56 cases of environment related text and publication of the first textbook \"Humans and the Environment\" are some of the steps taken in this regard.\nA significant surge in the quantity and quality of civil society activism was the result of planning for enhanced nongovernmental organization participation in policy and oversight. During this term private sector involvement in the management of protected areas and managing wildlife conservation was promoted through legislation and incentives. Introducing local legislation for management schemes of national parks and protected areas and for wildlife and endangered species conservation schemes for the first time. Nature Rangers enjoyed high quality training and education programs while awareness campaigns led to improvements in their social status. International diplomacy in collaboration with UNEP, UNDP, JICA, UNESCO led to many joint projects including participatory training for local farmers and villagers in Urumia basin area, Conservation of the Cheetah, Second International Seminar on Environment Religion and Culture, First UN Conference on Combating Dust and Sand Storms, Project for Restoration of Anzali Wetland, Project for Coastal Zone Management Projects and many others.\n\nThe fifth international Green Film festival was revived, four rounds of International Environment Exhibition, four rounds of Green Industry Competition and Four Rounds of the National Environment Award was convened during this term. 20 Bilateral and multilateral MOUs were signed and implemented leading to more than 50 technical and educational workshops and sessions. Nationwide campaigns on \"no to plastics\", \"reduction of waste\", \"and energy conservation\", \"no to food waste\" and many others were supported and promoted. The National Committee on Sustainable Development was transformed into an efficient cross sectoral body to promote and monitor sustainability indicators at the national level.\n\nEbtekar was named one of the seven 2006 Champions of the Earth by the United Nations Environment Program as a prominent and \"inspirational\" environmental leader who has made an impact at policy level in a region of the world. Ebtekar said that she believes the award was a team effort, earned by the scholars and experts that she assembled in her Department of the Environment. She names President Khatami as instrumental in stressing the importance of environmental initiatives. She was also named as one of 50 environmental leaders by \"The Guardian\" newspaper on January 5, 2008; the only Iranian or Muslim woman in the list.\n\nIn the 2012 edition of The Muslim500 Ebtekar has been named as one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. Under the political section of this yearbook, Ebtekar is described as \"a considerable force in the reformist movement in Iran\".\n\nOn 24 January 2014, Ebtekar was awarded the Energy Globe Foundation Honorary Lifetime Achievement Award in Tehran.\n\nOn 29 November 2014, Masoumeh Ebtekar won the Italian Minerva Award for her scientific achievements and successful career in political arena. Minerva Award is a nongovernmental award established in 2009 in the name of Madame Anna Maria Mammoliti, Italian journalist and social activist after her death.\nThe Minerva Award has been presented to famous figures active in different social, economic, political and cultural fields, and the receivers have been mainly women.\n\nOn May 2016 Ebtekar was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Political Science by the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, Korea.\n\nEbtekar co-founded the Center for Peace and Environment in 2005, a non-governmental organization devoted to the promotion of just and sustainable peace and the protection of the environment. More than 120 experts and academicians are currently members of the Center.\n\nEbtekar served as a moderator in June 2008 at the International \"Women, Equality and Peace\" Conference held in Oslo, Norway. The conference was sponsored by the Foundation for Dialogue Among Civilizations, Club de Madrid and the Oslo Center.\n\nEbtekar considered for running in the 2009 presidential election after Guardian Council indicated that there is no \"legal restraint\" against women doing so. However, she withdrew a few weeks before the election.\n\nEbtekar published her memoir as the first female Vice President of Iran, entitled the \"Grapes of Shahrivar\" on May 3, 2009. She has also published a collection of her essays and speeches on the environment and sustainable development, called \"Natural Peace\". After leaving her government position in 2005, Ebtekar has spoken as inaugural or keynote speaker at many international events.\n\nEbtekar ran for and was elected to the city council of Tehran for the term beginning in 2007, coming in 9th out of 21 candidates, just after Parvin Ahmadinejad, the sister of the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. She established and heads the Tehran City Council Environment Committee and currently runs 20 working groups on environmental issues.\n\nAfter election to the City Council of Tehran in early 2007, Ebtekar began a weblog in Persian entitled \"\"EbtekareSabz\"\" under the free blog service Persianblog. In her blog she wrote 430 posts in environmental, political, social and women's issues, posted over 10,000 comments, the blog had one million viewers in 3.5 years. \"EbtekareSabz\", which criticized the policies of the government and supported the reformist movement in Iran, was filtered by the Government once in early 2010 and again in June 2010. and finally obstructed with a judicial verdict in August. Citing the \"right to freedom of expression in our constitution\" as her incentive, she continued blogging by setting up a new blog.\n\nIn 2009, the \"New York Times\" described her as \"informally represent[ing] the views of many of the former hostage-takers\", supporting \"engagement with the West\" and a renewal of the \"original ideals of the revolution, including justice and freedom,\" which many of her peers believe have been abandoned by the current regime.\n\nIn May 2013, Ebtekar signed up as a candidate for Tehran in the 2013 local elections, along with hundreds of reformist candidates. During the vetting process that is conducted by government and Majlis representatives, the majority of candidates, including Ebtekar were disqualified. Ebtekar mentioned her harsh criticism of government policies leading to air pollution and the deterioration of environmental standards as the main reason for her disqualification. Candidates who have objected to their disqualification will be considered for a final round in the Supreme Council for Election Regulation. She was also one of Reformists' candidates as Mayor of Tehran. However, Mohsen Hashemi becomes the final's nominate.\n\nAfter Hassan Rouhani elected as President of Iran, Ebtekar who supported Rouhani openly, was one of the candidates for the Ministry of Science. However, she was appointed as Head of Environmental Protection Organization on 10 September 2013, a position she had formerly served for eight years under Mohammad Khatami. On 1 August 2017, Ebtekar announced that she will be leaving her current position after the end of the first Rouhani government. She is set to appoint as Women Affairs's Vice President.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, Iranian state media announced that Ebtekar had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The infection was described as mild and she was not admitted to hospital. On 11 March, Ebtekar tweeted that she had recovered from the virus.\n\nIn 2010 Ebtekar contributed to \"Moral Ground\" a testimony of over eighty visionaries—theologians and religious leaders, scientists, elected officials, business leaders, naturalists, activists, and writers—to present a diverse and compelling call to honor our individual and collective moral responsibility to our planet. In her essay entitled \"Peace and Sustainability Depend on the Spiritual and the Feminine\" Ebtekar provides her views on the interrelated nature of peace and sustainable development. She also took part in a project to develop a book entitled \"Women, Power and Politics in 21st Century Iran\". The book, published in 2012 by Ashgate, provides an objective perspective on the conditions of women in Iran. Chapter 10 titled \"Women and the Environment\" has been authored by Massoumeh Ebtekar. In 2011 Ebtekar also co-authored a chapter in the book \"Stem Cells and Cancer Stem Cells\" published by Springer. Chapter 3 \"Characteristics of Cord Blood Cells\" is a review performed by a team of researchers in Iran.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the south-eastern section of Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara. It marks the border with the municipality of Grocka. It mostly stretches between Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and the Highway Belgrade–Niš, but also north of the boulevard (Zeleno Brdo). It extends into the neighborhoods of Mirijevo on the north, Konjarnik on the west, Medaković III on the south-west, Veliki Mokri Lug on the south and Kaluđerica (in Grocka municipality) on the east.\n\nMali Mokri Lug occupies the northern section of the Mokroluški potok valley, which is today used as a route for the Belgrade-Niš highway and divides Mali Mokri Lug and Veliki Mokri Lug. The neighborhood occupies the southern slopes of several hills (Bajdina, Zeleno Brdo, Stojčino Brdo with an altitude of ), descending into the Mokroluški potok's valley, so the entire neighborhood is built downhill.\n\nBelgrade's predecessor was a Celtic and Roman town of Singidunum. While the town's castrum occupied part of today's Belgrade Fortress, Singidunum's civilian zone spread from the modern Kralja Petra Street, over the both Sava and Danube slopes, till the neighborhood of Kosančićev Venac, extending in a series of necropolises from Republic Square, along the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra all the way to Mali Mokri Lug. One of the forts built by the Romans to protect the Via Militaris road, was \"Mutatio ad Sextum\", on the location of modern neighborhood.\n\nMali Mokri Lug used to be a separate village, outside Belgrade's urban zone. As Belgrade developed, with the construction of the large neighborhood of Konjarnik in the 1960s and 1970s and Mali Mokri Lug's rapid development as a suburb, it became part of the city's urban tissue and lost separate status after 1971, becoming a local community (\"mesna zajednica\", sub-municipal administrative unit) within Belgrade city proper (\"uža teritorija grada\"). Mali Mokri Lug continued to grow and now makes the easternmost section of Belgrade's urban proper, developing further east along Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and \"Smederevski put\", its continuation. With this growth, it now also makes continuous built-up area with formerly separate Veliki Mokri Lug (on the highway, at \"Lasta\" garage, at a tripoint with Kaluđerica's sub-neighborhood of Klenak at the bridge over the highway and with Kaluđerica directly along \"Smederevski put\" ).\n\nMali Mokri Lug had its own municipality in the 1950s. It was abolished on 1 January 1957 and merged into Zvezdara. It also comprised Kaluđerica, Leštane and Vinča which were later detached and annexed to the municipality of Grocka.

This was the oldest permanent Buddhist temple in Europe outside of the Russian and British empires. Since most Kalmyks fled in fear of the advancing Red Army, Josip Broz Tito's partisans requisitioned the building, damaged in the fighting for Liberation of Belgrade, turned it into a community centre, but a few years later sold it to a machinery plant which pulled it down and built a concrete workshop in its stead.\n\nIn June 2017, a new community health center was opened.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of population, Mali Mokri Lug had 22,024 inhabitants. It had a population of 1,600 in 1921 and 10,378 in 1971, before it was attached to Belgrade. Its name can be translated into English as \"little wet grove\". Likewise, the neighboring Veliki Mokri Lug means \"large wet grove\". The name originates from the presence of numerous water sources, now mostly in the eastern section of Veliki Mokri Lug. Near the highway, a cemetery for both neighborhoods is located (\"Mokroluško groblje\"). The area is primarily residential, but a major commercial zone developed along Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, with many repair shops, stores, etc.\n\n"}

A highly talented artist, he worked on many of their early anime and tokusatsu productions, doing storyboarding as well as special effects. Soon, he got to help out special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano as an uncredited assistant for \"The Return of Godzilla\" (1984). But his first major FX credit came with Daicon's 1985 low-budget daikaiju epic-comedy, \"The Eight-Headed Giant Serpent Strikes Back\". He continued to be a storyboarder for anime such as \"Gunbuster\" (1988) and \"Otaku no Video\" (1991), and was the special effects director for Toho/Tsuburaya Productions' 1991 SF-thriller, \"\".\n\nAs a key Daicon/Gainax member, he also played an important part in the creation of one of the most popular anime series, \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" (1995). He was a writer and art director/storyboarder for the series. He was also the namesake for the show's protagonist, Shinji Ikari. He later voice-acted a musician modeled after himself in 2 episodes of \"Karekano\".\n\nThat same year was another turning point for Higuchi - he had directed the special effects for the highly acclaimed revamped \"Gamera\" trilogy, all three films directed by Shusuke Kaneko. Higuchi proved himself to be a top master in the field of Japanese special effects with the final film, \"\" in 1999. He continued to direct FX for movies such as \"Sakuya - Slayer of Demons\" (2000), \"Princess Blade\" and \"Pistol Opera\", both 2001.\n\nIn addition to special effects direction, Higuchi provided the CG animation for the first \"Hamtaro\" movie, and storyboarded the fight scenes for the CG tokusatsu superhero epic, \"Casshern\" (2004), based on Tatsuo Yoshida's 1973 anime series.\n\nIn 2005, he directed the tokusatsu SF/World War II epic, \"Lorelei\", which became a box-office success in Japan. His next project was a remake of the classic 70s Toho disaster film \"Japan Sinks\", released in 2006. The latter film was a massive success at the box office, but was poorly received by critics and won second place at the Bunshun Kiichigo Awards (the Japanese equivalent of the Razzie Awards) in 2006.

He was an important member of the Parisian avant-garde art scene in the late 1880s and early 1890s.\n\nCharles Théophile Angrand was born in Criquetot-sur-Ouville, Normandy, France, to schoolmaster Charles P. Angrand (1829–96) and his wife Marie (1833–1905).\n\nHe received artistic training in Rouen at Académie de Peinture et de Dessin. His first visit to Paris was in 1875, to see a retrospective of the work of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot at École des Beaux-Arts. Corot was an influence on Angrand's early work.\n\nAfter being denied entry into École des Beaux-Arts, he moved to Paris in 1882, where he began teaching mathematics at Collège Chaptal. His living quarters were near Café d'Athènes, Café Guerbois, Le Chat Noir, and other establishments frequented by artists. Angrand joined the artistic world of the Parisian avant-garde, becoming friends with such luminaries as Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Signac, Maximilien Luce, and Henri-Edmond Cross. His avant-garde artistic and literary contacts influenced him, and in 1884 he co-founded Société des Artistes Indépendants, along with Seurat, Signac, Odilon Redon, and others.\n\nAngrand's Impressionist paintings of the early 1880s, generally depicting rural subjects and containing broken brushstrokes and light-filled colouration, reflect the influences of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Jules Bastien-Lepage. Through his interactions with Seurat, Signac, and others in the mid-1880s, his style evolved towards Neo-Impressionism. From 1887 his paintings were Neo-Impressionist and his drawings incorporated Seurat's tenebrist style. Angrand had the \"ability to distil poetry from the most banal suburban scene\". In 1887 he met van Gogh, who proposed a painting exchange (which ultimately did not happen). Van Gogh was influenced by Angrand's thick brushstrokes and Japanese-inspired compositional asymmetry. Also in 1887, \"L'Accident\", his first Divisionist painting, was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants. Angrand joined Seurat in plein air painting on La Grande Jatte island.\n\nAngrand's implementation of Pointillist techniques differed from that of some of its leading proponents. He painted with a more muted palette than Seurat and Signac, who used bright contrasting colours. As seen in \"Couple in the street\", Angrand used dots of various colours to enhance shadows and provide the proper tone, while avoiding the violent colouration found in many other Neo-Impressionist works. His monochrome conté crayon drawings such as his self-portrait above, which also demonstrate his delicate handling of light and shadow, were assessed by Signac: \"... his drawings are masterpieces. It would be impossible to imagine a better use of white and black ... These are the most beautiful drawings, poems of light, of fine composition and execution.\"\n\nAngrand exhibited his work in Paris at Les Indépendants, Galerie Druet, Galérie Durand-Ruel, and Bernheim-Jeune, and also in Rouen. His work appeared in Brussels in an 1891 show with Les XX. In the early 1890s, he abandoned painting, instead creating conté drawings and pastels of subjects including rural scenes and depictions of mother and child, realized in dark Symbolist intensity. During this period, he also drew illustrations for anarchist publications such as \"Les Temps nouveaux\"; other Neo-Impressionists contributing to these publications included Signac, Luce, and Théo van Rysselberghe.\n\nIn 1896 he moved to Saint-Laurent-en-Caux, in Upper Normandy. He began painting again around 1906, emulating the styles and colours of Signac and Cross. Angrand developed his own unique methods of Divisionism, with larger brushstrokes. As this resulted in rougher optical blending than small dots, he compensated by using more intense colours. Some of his landscapes from this period are almost nonrepresentational. Before World War I, he lived for a year in Dieppe. Then he moved back to Rouen, living there for the rest of his life. He was very reclusive for his last thirty years, but remained a dedicated correspondent. Angrand died in Rouen on 1 April 1926. He is buried in Cimetière monumental de Rouen.\n\nAngrand's work is in many museum collections, including Ateneum (Finnish National Gallery), Cleveland Museum of Art, Hecht Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musée d'Orsay, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.\n\nIn 2010, LAVA created the Charles Angrand (Artwork) Award, which has been awarded annually since 2011. The LAVA Awards are held annually to honor excellence in books relating to the principles of liberty, with the Charles Angrand Award being the grand prize award for artwork.\n\n\n"}

He was educated by private tutor and in 1823–24 attended Trinity College, Dublin, where he met his predecessor as Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell.\n\nKennedy entered the British Army, and was gazetted an Ensign in the 27th Foot 11th Regiment on 15 August 1827. Until 1837 he served with infantry regiments on Corfu. He spent 1838–1839 and 1841–1844 in British North America. In 1841 he purchased a Captaincy in the 68th Foot.\n\nKennedy returned to Ireland in 1846, and the following year sold his captaincy and took up an appointment with the Poor Law Commission. His job was to administer relief to the many inhabitants of County Clare who were affected by the Potato Famine. He was shocked by what he saw and had serious differences with the local Landlord, Colonel Crofton Moore Vandeleur.\n\nIn 1851, the famine having ended, Kennedy's position was abolished, and he applied for a position in the Colonial Service. In May 1852 he was appointed Governor of The Gambia, but before assuming office he was appointed Governor of Sierra Leone instead. He served in this office until 1854, during which time he made many administrative changes in an attempt to reform the corrupt and inefficient government.\n\nIn 1854, Kennedy was promoted to the position of Governor of Western Australia. He took up the position the following year, serving until 1862. He reputedly had an autocratic manner and was considered a despot by many Western Australians. Popular opinion quickly turned against him, and in August 1856 a public meeting was held in Perth to protest against his methods. During his tenure as governor, Western Australia flourished, essentially because of the large amount of British money that was spent in the colony under the system of penal transportation of convicts. However, when Kennedy resigned in 1862, he claimed that much of the colony's success was due to his legislative efforts. On his return to England, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB).\n\nKennedy's next appointment came in July 1863. The decision had been made that Vancouver Island and British Columbia, which had previously been governed together by a single governor (Sir James Douglas), were each to have their own governor, and Kennedy was appointed Governor of Vancouver Island. Compared to his previous appointments, Vancouver Island was comparatively insignificant, and might be considered a demotion. Kennedy arrived at Vancouver Island in March 1864. Facing an extremely aggressive Legislative Assembly determined to challenge his executive power, Kennedy achieved little of note in his two years in office. During this time the colony fell into a disastrous economic depression, and Kennedy was unfairly blamed by the colony's inhabitants. With the creation of the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, Kennedy left office in October 1866.\n\nKennedy returned to London, and in December 1867 he was knighted (KCB) and appointed Governor of the West African Settlements. He served there until 1872. In 1871 he was created a KCMG.\n\nIn 1872, Kennedy was appointed the 7th Governor of Hong Kong, a position in which he served until 1877. During his tenure, he created the Hong Kong dollar, which served as the unitary monetary unit for the territory. Since this time, the Hong Kong dollar has (albeit with a short period of disruption) served as the single monetary unit for the entire territory. He also developed Kennedy Town, the western end of Victoria City on the Hong Kong Island. Sir Arthur's style of governing was to do as little as possible and to be nice to everyone. 'Don't rock the boat' became a cornerstone of Hong Kong's political philosophy. Hong Kong prospered during this period.\n\nAfter his appointment as Governor of Hong Kong expired, Kennedy was immediately appointed Governor of Queensland, serving in that position until 1883. That was his last post in the Colonial Service. In 1881, Kennedy was created a GCMG.\n\nOn his resignation as Governor of Queensland, Kennedy boarded the \"Orient\" with the intention of returning to England. On 3 June 1883, when the \"Orient\" was off Aden in the Red Sea, Kennedy died. He was buried at sea.\n\nIn 1839, Kennedy married Georgina MacCartney, who died on 3 October 1874. They had two daughters and a son, Arthur Herbert Williams, who entered the army. His daughter, Elizabeth, married Richard Meade, 4th Earl of Clanwilliam. Kennedy's other daughter, Georgina Mildred, was honoured by having the Georgina River named after her in 1880, during his time in office in Queensland. William Landsborough had named this river the Herbert in 1861, but it was decided that it needed a new name because there was another river in Queensland that had that same name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976348", "title": "Felipe Calderón", "text": "Felipe Calderón\n\nFelipe de Jesús Calderón Hinojosa, (; born 19 August 1962) is a Mexican politician who served as the 56th President of Mexico from 1 December 2006 to 30 November 2012. He was a member of the National Action Party (\"Partido Acción Nacional\", PAN) for thirty years before quitting the party in November 2018.\n\nHis father was Luis Calderón Vega, one of the founders of the PAN as well as one of its most prominent members; Felipe himself joined the aforementioned party in the 80s. Prior to becoming President, Calderón received two master's degrees and went on to work within the PAN when it was still an opposition party during the PRI regime. Calderón served as National President of the party, Federal Deputy, and Secretary of Energy in Vicente Fox's cabinet. He served in the cabinet of the previous administration up until he resigned to run for the Presidency and secured his party's nomination.\n\nIn the 2006 Presidential election, he ran as the PAN candidate. After a heated campaign and a controversial electoral process, the Federal Electoral Institute's official results gave Calderón a tiny lead (less than 1% of advantage of the total votes) above PRD candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador. While López Obrador and the PRD disputed the results and called for a complete recount of the votes, Calderón's victory was confirmed months later on September 5, 2006, by the Federal Electoral Tribunal. Calderón's inauguration ceremony at the Congress of the Union was tense and lasted less than five minutes, as he only recited the oath of office while the PRD legislators shouted in protest against the alleged electoral fraud, and afterwards he quickly left the building for security reasons as some of the legislators engaged in violent brawls.\n\nHis presidency was marked by his declaration of \"war\" against the drug cartels only ten days after taking office; this was considered by most observers as an immediate strategy to gain popular legitimacy for the new President after the convoluted elections. Calderón sanctioned Operation Michoacán, the first large-scale deployment of federal troops against the drug cartels. By the end of his administration, the official number of deaths related to the drug war was at least 60,000. The murder rate skyrocketed during his presidency parallel to that of the ignition of the drug war, with the murder rate peaking in 2010 and decreasing during the last two years of his term. The main architect of the drug war, Genaro García Luna (who was Secretary of Public Security during the entirety of Calderón's administration), was arrested on the United States in 2019 due to alleged links with the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nCalderón's term was also marked by the Great Recession, which resulted in a 4.7% drop in gross domestic product for 2009. An economic recovery the following year resulted in growth of 5.11%. In 2007, Calderón established ProMéxico, a public trust fund that promotes Mexico's interests in international trade and investment. The total foreign direct investment during Calderón's presidency was US$70.494 billion. As a result of the countercyclical package passed in 2009 to address the effects of the global recession, the national debt increased from 22.2% to 35% of GDP by December 2012. The poverty rate increased from 43 to 46%.\n\nOther significant events during Calderón's presidency include the 2008 passing of criminal justice reforms (fully implemented in 2016), the 2009 flu pandemic, the 2010 establishment of the Agencia Espacial Mexicana, the 2011 founding of the Pacific Alliance and the achievement of universal healthcare through Seguro Popular (passed under the Fox administration) in 2012. Under the Calderón administration sixteen new Protected Natural Areas were created. He began a one-year fellowship at John F. Kennedy School of Government in January 2013, and returned to Mexico following the end of his tenure.\n\nHis wife Margarita Zavala was briefly an independent candidate in the 2018 presidential election before dropping out in 17 May.\n\nAfter three decades of being a PAN member, he left the party on 11 November 2018 to found his own party \"México Libre\", which intends to debut in the 2021 legislative elections.\n\nFelipe Calderón was born in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico on August 18, 1962. He is the youngest of five brothers and son of Carmen Hinojosa Calderón and the late Luis Calderón Vega.\n\nHis father was a co-founder of the National Action Party and an important political figure. The elder Calderón occupied state posts and served a term as federal deputy. He spent most of his life working within the party and spent most of his free time promoting the PAN. The young Calderón was active in his father's campaigns. As a boy, he distributed party pamphlets and flyers, rode PAN campaign vehicles and chanted slogans at rallies.\n\nAfter growing up in Morelia, Calderón moved to Mexico City, where he received a bachelor's degree in law from the Escuela Libre de Derecho. Later, he received a master's degree in economics from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) and a Master of Public Administration degree in 2000 from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nFollowing his father's example, he joined the PAN, with the desire of one day becoming Mexico's president. It was in the National Action Party that Calderón met his wife, Margarita Zavala, who served in Congress as a federal deputy. They have three children, María, Luis Felipe and Juan Pablo.\n\nCalderón is Roman Catholic.\n\nTo demands for detailed revelation of his personal positions on abortion, Calderón responded that he voted for life. Calderón's administration sought to maintain moderate positions on social policy and supported Mexican legislation guaranteeing abortion for rape victims, when pregnancy endangers a woman's life or in cases of severe fetal deformity; has publicly advocated the legalization of small quantities of cocaine and other drugs for addicts who agree to undergo treatment; and has approved a right-to-die initiative for ill patients to refuse invasive treatment or extraordinary efforts to prolong their lives. As for his economic policies, he supports balanced fiscal policies, flat taxes, lower taxes, and free trade.\n\nCalderón was president of the PAN's youth movement in his early twenties.\n\nHe was a local representative in the Legislative Assembly and, on two different occasions, in the federal Chamber of Deputies. He ran for the governorship of Michoacán in 1995 and served as national president of the PAN from 1996 to 1999. During his tenure, his party maintained control of 14 state capitals, but also faced a reduced presence in the federal Chamber of Deputies.\n\nSoon after Vicente Fox took office as president, Calderón was appointed director of Banobras, a state-owned development bank. He was accused by political opponents of committing abuse, disputing use of certain legal procedures to finance property valued between three and five million Mexican pesos (between US$300,000 and $500,000); however, once political objections arose, he used other means to formalize his transaction.\n\nHe joined the presidential cabinet as Secretary of Energy, replacing Ernesto Martens. He left the post in May 2004 in protest of Vicente Fox's criticism of his presidential ambitions while supporting those of Santiago Creel.\n\nMembers of his party chose him as the PAN presidential candidate. In a series of three primary elections, he defeated the favored former Secretary of the Interior under President Vicente Fox, and thus the election of Calderón as party candidate surprised many analysts. The PAN pointed to his competitive primary election as a sign of internal democracy. In other major parties, there was one candidate or all strong candidates but one were eliminated.\n\nCalderón's campaign gained momentum after the first presidential debate. Subsequent poll numbers put him ahead of López Obrador from March to May; some polls favored him by as much as 9 percentage points. This trend in his favor was contained after the second presidential debate when López Obrador decided to start joining the debates. Final poll numbers days ahead of the results indicated that his opponent's prior lead had shrunk further; some polls gave López Obrador the lead, while others favored Calderón and still others indicated a technical tie.\n\nSummary of the 2 July 2006 Mexican presidential election results\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" colspan=2 |Candidates\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" |Party\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" |Alliance\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" |Votes\n! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" |%\n\nThe Mexican Constitution states that the President must be inaugurated by taking the oath of office before Congress in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies.

Ahead of claims that the PRD would disrupt the precedings, the PAN took control of Congress's main floor three days before the inauguration was scheduled.\n\nOn November 30, 2006, outgoing President Vicente Fox Quesada and still President-elect Felipe Calderón Hinojosa stood side-by-side on national television as Fox turned over the presidential sash to a cadet, who handed it to Calderón. Afterwards, Fox read a short speech indicating that he had concluded his mandate by receiving the flag \"that had accompanied him during the last six years which he had devoted himself completely to the service of Mexico and had the utmost honor of being the president of the republic\". Calderón then made a speech to the Mexican public indicating that he would still attend the inauguration ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies. He made a call to unity.\n\nCalderón's inauguration ceremony on 1 December at the Congress of the Union was tense and lasted less than five minutes, as he barely managed to recite the oath of office while the PRD legislators shouted in protest against the alleged electoral fraud and attempted to impede his inauguration, and afterward he quickly left the building for security reasons as some of the legislators engaged in violent brawls. Besides the claims of fraud, Calderón took office with the smallest percentage of votes for a winning presidential candidate in Mexican history (35.8%), which meant that his administration would face severe legitimacy problems. Only a month after taking office, Calderón declared war on the drug cartels and organized crime, thus beginning the Mexican Drug War. This was considered by many as an immediate strategy to gain popular legitimacy and acceptation for the new President after the convoluted elections.\n\nDuring his first months of government, President Calderón took several actions, such as introducing the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact and a cap on the salaries of public servants, described politically as \"seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to incorporate the agenda of election rival Andrés Manuel López Obrador into his government.\"\n\nCalderón created the largest number of universities (96) in the history of Mexico. He was also the only president who granted full coverage and a secure spot in elementary schools to children from 6 to 11 years old. The Office of Social Aid for Victims of Violence (in Spanish: \"Procuraduría Social para Víctimas de la Violencia\") was created by him in 2011. During Calderón's administration, more than 1,000 hospitals were created, and more than 2,000 were reconstructed and amplified. During Vicente Fox's administration, only 40 million people had access to a public health care system. Currently, more than 100 million Mexicans have access to their country's health care system due to Calderón's effort to implement a universal health care system. Moreover, Calderón created more than 16,500 kilometers of interstate highways. Calderón also dispatched military forces all over Mexico since the beginning of his presidency to put down the drug cartels and the increasing violence generated by the criminal organizations that fight with rival groups for territory.\n\nThe administration's move towards universal healthcare coverage remains one of the most popular policies of the administration. He launched Seguro Popular to make this policy a reality. Through his policies, significant health infrastructure has been built and access expanded in many areas of the country, while the costs have been lowered significantly for many people to the point that many medicines have already been distributed free of charge.\n\nThe 2009 Swine Flu epidemic struck Mexico and was labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The administration declared a state of emergency and acted firmly in giving open information to the world about the swine flu epidemic, and it acted with tough measures to contain its spread by shutting down many public services including schools. President Calderón appeared on television explaining the situation and demonstrating basic precautionary measures to take during the epidemic such as coughing into one's elbow rather than into the air. Tamiflu and vaccines were used in 2009 and in 2010 during flu season, and some deaths were undoubtedly prevented by the strong measures that were taken as well as due to a reduction in the spread and severity of the disease. Policies keeping people home and awareness of effective strategies may have helped prevent virulent forms of the virus from spreading as easily as minor forms that were harder to detect and identify. Criticism of Calderón's handling varied from early claims that his administration was not doing enough to later claims that the administration had exaggerated the measures that it had taken.\n\nThe Mexican Genome Project was initiated by Calderón's administration in part as a response to the swine flu outbreak and to safeguard the discovering of genetic markers that will better target and assist Mexico's 100+ million people in regards to prevention and treatment of diseases and other health concerns such as diabetes. A study on the efficacy of the project confirmed, according to Dr. Jiménez-Sánchez, that \"It is not possible today to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 Influenza A mortality rate in Mexico. However, knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases, including infections such as the flu.\" \"It will also help develop pharmacogenomics to help produce medicines tailored to people of a specific genetic group, to the creation of drugs that are both safer and more effective.\" Calderón commended the achievement: \"The genomic map of the Mexican population is an essential contribution of Mexico to science and public health. This study represents an important landmark to develop genomic medicine in Mexico to improve healthcare of its population. I commend our National Institute of Genomic Medicine, INMEGEN, for such a significant milestone.\"\n\nFelipe Calderón's administration raised awareness of environment issues including deforestation and climate change through various policy measures such as planting over 8 million trees and attracting green-technology companies to Mexico. Mexico also achieved a significant reduction in deforestation. This includes $2.5 billion investment in wind farms.\n\nThe country's total GDP on a purchasing-power-parity basis is the 11th largest in the world and public policy now seeks to create quality jobs, reduce poverty and protect the standard of living of all classes. The administration has worked to attract investment, diversify the economy away from over-reliance on oil and the US market, upgrade infrastructure that has not kept up with the demands of the large economy, add jobs, reduce poverty, provide for a large middle class and reduce inequality. In keeping with its protection of the purchasing power of those least able to shield themselves through the use of financial instruments, the administration has succeeded in keeping prices and interest rates relatively low and stable even during the Great Recession and European debt crisis, while also avoiding the currency crashes of the 1980s and 1990s. The Mexican economy has been growing more quickly than the US economy during all but one year of the administration, even as US growth has been sluggish.\n\nThe administration has accelerated the building of public works projects and allocated federal funds towards infrastructure such as roads and bridges as an investment in the country's future growth.\n\nIn 2012, the massive Baluarte Bridge was inaugurated, which speeds travel between Mazatlán and Durango and allows for faster access between Mexico's coasts. The Baluarte Bridge is so high that the Eiffel Tower could fit under its central span.\n\nThrough investments in infrastructure and free trade agreements, the administration won investments from many auto companies that decided to build factories in Mexico and expand existing facilities and models produced in Mexico. Mexico has become one of the top auto manufacturers in the world and for two years in a row far exceeded the previous records of auto production and export.\n\nMexico also has a nascent aeronautics and aviation industry and large electronics and consumer goods industries, all of which have been attracting significant investment capital and higher-value manufacturing for a skilled workforce. Heineken made significant investments in Mexico's beverage industry during this administration.\n\nIn a move to expand new export opportunities that attract employment and diversify Mexico's crucial export sector away from excessive dependence on the US market, Mexico also expanded its trade accords beyond the US borders and sought to increase trade with the European Union, East Asia and Latin America. It was hoped that new infrastructure would help diversify Mexico's economy and improve stability in years to come. One new cooperative accord between major Latin American nations on the Pacific coast, called PaCiFiCa by \"the Economist\", has helped to isolate the participating nations from some of the fluctuations stemming from the European debt crisis as it looks towards greater trade with Asian nations. Mexico maintains positive trading relationships and trade discussions throughout the world so as to make Mexico an open economy with a growing number of trade opportunities for all regions of Mexico and aided by new infrastructure.\n\nThe international price of corn rose dramatically throughout 2006, leading to the inflation of tortilla prices in the first month of Calderón's term. Because tortillas are the main food product consumed by the country's poorest, national concerns over the rising prices immediately generated political pressure on Calderón's administration.\n\nThe president opted to use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn. This price control came in the form of the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at 8.50 pesos per kilogram of tortilla. The hope was that a ceiling on corn prices would provide incentive for the market to lower all prices nationally.\n\nCritics argue that the pact was both nonbinding and a de facto acceptance of a maximum 30% increase in the price of that product (from 5.95 pesos per kilogram to 8.50 pesos per kilogram). Some tortillerías ignored the agreement, leading to price increases well in excess of the 8.50 pesos. Government opposition argued that this was an indication of the failure to protect the interests of its poor citizens. However, several major supermarkets, such as Soriana and Comercial Mexicana, sell the tortillas at a lower price than the one in the agreement – as low as 5.10 pesos per kilogram – which is interpreted opponents to price controls as clear evidence that price controls and the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact were unnecessary. Additionally, PROFECO, a consumer protection government organization, has also threatened with jail those tortilla producers who charge \"excessive\" prices.\n\nGuillermo Ortiz, governor of the Bank of Mexico, labeled the agreement \"a success\" for consumers and urged for it to continue as means to combat rising inflation.\n\nFulfilling an electoral promise, President Calderón launched the First Employment Program, which aims to create new opportunities for people entering the job market. The program will give cash incentives to companies for hiring first-time job holders, including young people graduating from higher education and millions of women who have never worked.\n\nThe program has been interpreted as an effort to stop immigration into the United States. Immigration to the United States has been reduced, but many complex factors are involved including the US slowdown since 2008.\n\nReactions to this program have been mixed. The president of the Mexican Association of Directors in Human Relations, Luis García, has anticipated a positive effect and even showed Nextel's subsidiary in Mexico as an example for hiring 14% of its new workforce in 2006 as people in their \"first employment\". Secretary of Labor Javier Lozano Alarcón has admitted that the program by itself will be insufficient to create as many new jobs as needed and has called for deeper reforms to allow for further investment.\n\nPresident Calderón announced, on his first day as president, a presidential decree limiting the president's salary and that of cabinet ministers. The measure excludes much of the bureaucracy and public servants in the legislative or judicial branches. According to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by \"Reforma\", the decree will affect 546 high-level government officials and save the government about US$13 million. The opposition has stated that the 10% reduction in salary as not being comprehensive enough.\n\nLike his opponent in the 2006 election, Calderón also proposed laws that, if passed, would lower salaries for public servants in all three branches of government and impose a cap on compensation. The proposal also includes measures to make the remuneration of public servants more transparent and subject to fiscalization.\n\nDespite imposing a cap on salaries of high-ranking public servants, Calderón ordered a raise on the salaries of the Federal Police and the Mexican armed forces on his first day as president.\n\nCalderón's government also ordered massive raids on drug cartels upon assuming office in December 2006 in response to an increasingly deadly spate of violence in his home state of Michoacán. The decision to intensify drug enforcement operations has led to an ongoing conflict between the federal government and the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nOn January 19, 2007, Mexico captured the leader of one of its seven major drug cartels, the Diaz Parada gang, five weeks into an army crackdown on narco gangs. Mexican soldiers and federal police jointly arrested Pedro Diaz Parada, whose cartel has operated across southern Mexico, on Tuesday in the southern city of Oaxaca, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said.\n\nThe next day, in a controversial move, the government announced the extradition to the United States of several drug gang leaders.\nThe Mexican government has also ordered Mexican soldiers and Federal Police into several cities, most notably, Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez. In Tijuana and also Ciudad Juárez, the army ordered that all local police officers surrender their weapons, as it is suspected that many officers have ties with drug cartels. Other states where actions have been taken include Michoacán, Tamaulipas, Tabasco, and Guerrero.\n\nIn a January 2007 interview with the \"Financial Times\", Calderón said, \"We have received very encouraging results. In the state of Michoacán, for example, the murder rate has fallen almost 40 percent compared with the average over the last six months. People's support in the regions where we are operating has grown, and that has been very important. Opinion polls have confirmed that, and I think we have made it clear to everyone that this issue is a priority for us\".\n\nOn April 9, 2007, the Secretariat of Defense announced in a report the results of the first four months of Calderón's presidency: the capture of 1,102 drug dealers, the seizure of about $500 million pesos, 556 kilograms of marijuana, 1,419 military grade weapons, two airplanes, 630 automobiles, and 15 sea ships that transported drugs, and the destruction of 285 clandestine runways, 777 drug camps, 52,842 marijuana farms and 33,019 opium poppy farms.\n\nOn December 16, 2009, the Mexican Navy killed Arturo Beltrán-Leyva, a once important drug trafficker. During Calderon's term, 25 of the 37 most wanted drug lords were either captured or killed.\n\nThe government was relatively successful in detaining drug lords; however, drug-related violence remained high in contested areas along the U.S. border such as Ciudad Juárez, Tijuana, and Matamoros. Some analysts, like US Ambassador in Mexico Carlos Pascual, argued that this rise in violence was a direct result of Felipe Calderón's military measures. Although homicide rates in Mexico from 2000–2007 showed a general decline, now Mexico is considered to be among the top ten countries with the highest homicide rates. Since Calderón launched his military strategy against organized crime in 2006, there has been an alarming increase in violent deaths related to organized crime, \"more than 15,000 people have died in suspected drug attacks since it was launched at the end of 2006.\" More than 5,000 people were murdered in Mexico in 2008, followed by 9600 murders in 2009, 2010 was violent, with over 15,000 homicides across the country.\n\nNot all those killed by the police and armed forces were criminals. Javier Francisco Arredondo Verdugo 23, and Jorge Antonio Mercado Alonso, 24, students at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education in Nuevo León, were killed by the Mexican Army on March 19, 2010 in Mexico. First the army denied having anything to do with the killings, and then they falsely accused the young men of being drug dealers who were \"armed to the teeth.\" \n\n2011 showed higher homicides and 2012 showed a similar rate as 2011, with 2012 also being a Presidential transition year and a year with high security spending nationwide. Homicides in 2020 and 2011 were in the 20,000 to 27,000 range.\n\nIt was expected that Calderón would continue with the foreign policy started during Fox's term, known as the Castañeda Doctrine, abandoning of the Estrada Doctrine. He was expected to mediate with 'free market' Latin American countries.\n\nCalderón had been a proponent of the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project which was now merged with a similar funding and infrastructure project, the Puebla-Panama Plan (PPP), started during the Fox administration. Calderón expanded the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project / PPP, now including Colombia, and an agreement of cooperation against organized crime. Jorge G. Castañeda, Secretary of Foreign Affairs during the first half of Fox's administration and proponent of the \"Castañeda Doctrine\", suggested that Calderón's leadership and the Mesoamerican Integration and Development Project / PPP should be used as a counterpart to Hugo Chávez's leadership of left-wing policies in Latin America. Calderón has stated that \"the challenge (of the PPP) is to foster democratic practices with solid foundation in the region\".\n\nAnother landmark was the proposed Mérida Initiative, a security cooperation initiative between the United States, the government of Mexico and the countries of Central America, with the aim of combating the threats of drug trafficking and transnational crime.\n\nThe Cancún Accord was a widely praised triumph credited to the deft handling by the Calderón and his team and received a standing ovation. Along with hosting and chairing the Cancún climate accord that reached agreements on targets and reaffirmed the agreement on compensating developing nations for damage from climate change, Mexico earned the G-20's trust and confidence to preside over the group during 2012, including a summit in Los Cabos.\n\nFelipe Calderón made immigration reform one of his main priorities, and in 2008 he and the Mexican Congress passed a bill decriminalizing undocumented immigration into Mexico. He expressed his hopes that something be done to clear up the status of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the US.\n\nBefore meeting with President Bush in March 2007, Calderón openly expressed his disapproval of building a wall between the two nations. After the U.S. Senate rejected the Comprehensive Immigration bill, President Calderón called the decision a \"grave error\".\n\nAccording to a poll by Grupo Reforma taken from February 16 to February 18, 2007, Calderón's approval rating was 58%. In this poll, Mexicans interviewed give President Calderón and his actions a score of 6.6 out of 10. He is best rated in his actions on issues related to health and reducing drug trafficking (60% and 59% approval respectively), and worst rated on domestic and foreign policy (33% approval each).\n\nA poll by Ipsos-Bimsa shows a change in Calderon's approval rating at 57% in November 2007.\n\nIn June 2008, Calderon's approval rating jumped to 64% before slipping to 62% in September.\n\nAccording to a March 2010 poll by GEA-ISA, 45% of respondents approved of their president's performance, down seven points since November 2009 polling at 52%.\n\nPolling firm Buendia & Laredo released a survey showing President Calderón's approval rating at 54% on May 9, 2011.\n\nOn February 27, 2012, a poll by \"El Universal\" showed a 58% approval rating with only 11% disapproval, a decrease in concern for security from 48% to 33% polled listing security as the top concern facing the government, 42% say things have improved in Mexico since Felipe Calderón's administration, 21% said things have stayed the same, while 34% said things have gotten worse.\n\nGrupo Reforma's poll published between 22 March and 26 March 2012 noted that Calderón had an approval rate of 66% among 1,515 people.\n\nConsulta Mitofsky published a study on 23 August 2012 which concluded that after 22 trimesters the approval of Felipe Calderón fell to 46%.\n\nOn July 2, 2006, the day of the election, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) announced that the race was too close to call and chose not to make public a large and well-designed exit poll. However, as the preliminary results of the unofficial PREP database made clear the next morning, Felipe Calderón had a small lead of 1.04%.\n\nThe IFE called on the candidates to abstain from pronouncing themselves as winner, president-elect, or president. Both candidates disobeyed this call. First López Obrador declared that he had won the election, and soon thereafter Calderón proclaimed victory as well, pointing to the initial figures released by the IFE.\n\nOn July 6, 2006, the Federal Electoral Institute announced the official vote count in the 2006 presidential election, resulting in a narrow margin of 0.58% for Calderón over his closest contender, PRD candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador. However, López Obrador and his coalition alleged irregularities in a number of polling stations and demanded a national recount. Ultimately, the Federal Electoral Tribunal, in a unanimous vote, declared such a recount to be groundless and unfeasible and ordered a recount of those with supportable allegations, or about 9.07% of the 130,477 polling stations.\n\nOn September 5, 2006, even when the Federal Electoral Tribunal acknowledged the existence of irregularities in the election, Calderón was, after the change of the votes of two of the magistrates, unanimously declared president-elect by the tribunal with a lead of 233,831 votes, or 0.56%, over López Obrador. The electoral court concluded that minor irregularities without proof were insufficient to invalidate the election. The ruling was mandatory, final and could not be appealed.\n\nOn December 1, 2006, despite the PRD's plans to prevent Calderón from taking office, the inauguration in front of Congress was able to proceed. Hours before Calderón's arrival, lawmakers from the PRD and PAN parties began a brawl, in which several representatives threw punches and pushed, while others shouted at each other. PRD representatives shouted \"Fuera Fox\" (\"Out with President Fox\") and blew whistles, while PAN representatives responded with \"Mexico, Mexico\". Minutes before Calderón and Fox walked into Congress, the president of the Chamber of Deputies announced a legal quorum, thus enabling Calderón to legally take the oath of office. At 9:45 am CST, all Mexican media cut to the official national broadcast, where commentators discussed the situation and showed scenes inside the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies, Palacio de San Lázaro. At 9:50 am CST, Calderón entered the chamber through the back door of the palace and approached the podium, where he took the oath as required by the Constitution. After the anthem, opposition continued to yell in Spanish \"Felipe will fall\". PAN representatives shouted back, \"Sí se pudo\" (Yes, we could do it!).\nAt 10:00 am CST, the official broadcast ended, and most stations resumed their programming.\n\nAs the inaugural ceremony was transpiring in Congress, López Obrador led a rally of supporters in the Zócalo. Many supporters marched down Reforma Avenue toward the Auditorio Nacional, where Calderón would address an audience of supporters after his inauguration. The rally was stopped by a wall erected by the Federal Police.\n\nDuring his tenure as president, there were numerous reports in the Mexican media alleging that Calderón was an alcoholic, based on speeches and public appearances in which the President seemed to be drunk, slurring his words or making bizarre statements.\nOn 2 February 2011, opposition lawmakers in the Chamber of Deputies displayed a banner reading: \"Would you let a drunk drive your car? No, right? So why let one run your country?\". The next day, journalist Carmen Aristegui reported on the incident, and commented that while she didn't \"have any specific information\" as to whether the president had problems with alcohol, she added that \"this is a delicate topic\" and suggested that President Calderón had an obligation to reply to the accusations. This led to Aristegui being fired from MVS, the news company that hosted her radio show, \"for violating the ethical code\" of the firm. The termination resulted in widespread public protests, and Aristegui was reinstated a few days later. Neither she nor MVS Radio issued an official statement about her return to the air.\n\nA CNN report in August 2012 revealed the behind-the-scenes story of the firing and rehiring. On 4 February, shortly after Aristegui's on-air comments about President's Calderón's possible alcoholism, MVS president Joaquin Vargas received a phone call from Calderón's spokeswoman, Alejandra Sota. Vargas apologized for Aristegui's comment, and later that day was told by a cabinet official that the government would not be taking action on a matter involving MVS's broadcast frequencies until Aristegui herself offered a public apology. On 5 February, Sota handed Vargas a statement of apology and told him to instruct Aristegui to read it on the air. On 6 February, Aristegui refused; Vargas fired her immediately. Her termination was announced that evening, and within hours Sota phoned Vargas and told him she was alarmed by the intense reaction on social networks to the news of Aristegui's dismissal. After several days of public outcry and of extensive communication between Vargas and various representatives of Calderón, Aristegui returned to the air on February 21.\n\nIn 2012, journalist Julio Scherer García published a book entitled \"Calderón de cuerpo entero\", based on interviews with former president of the National Action Party, Manuel Espino Barrientos. The book details many instances of Calderón's alleged alcoholism, before and during his tenure as President.\n\nIn March 2017, five years after the end of his Presidency, Felipe Calderón attended a rally to support the candidacy of Josefina Vázquez Mota as governor of the State of Mexico. Many media outlets reported that Calderón appeared to be drunk during the event, with visible difficulties to hold his balance.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Mexican newspaper \"Excélsior\" ran an article on its website revealing that the Calderón administration authorized in February 2007 the installation of an interception system by the United States Department of State to analyse, process and store phone calls, e-mails and other internet services with the purpose of helping Calderón administration to fight organized crime and narcotraffic, in the context of the Mérida Initiative. The scandal remained largely ignored by the Peña administration even though several newspapers and news websites revealed in September 2013 that the president himself, Enrique Peña Nieto, was spied by the National Security Agency while he was presidential candidate. On 21 October 2013, it was revealed by \"Der Spiegel\" that the NSA had spied Calderón and other cabinet member e-mails. That same day Mr. Calderón tweeted that he had personally spoken with the actual Secretary of Foreign Affairs, José Antonio Meade Kuribeña, to \"help him\" transmit his most energic protest to the espionage he was subject, and later that day, Calderón tweeted that far more of a personal damage, it was a grievance to the Mexican institutions and that he would not make further statements on the theme.\n\nMexican journalist Raymundo Riva-Palacio criticized (on his columns of October 21 and October 23) the privileges given by the Calderón administration to American intelligences agencies and bilateral cooperation in general, and wrote: \"...It can be argued that Washington mocked him and betrayed him...\" Mr. Riva-Palacio wrote that American intelligence agencies coordinated field operations and even interrogated the detainees before Mexican authorities could do their own. According to Mr. Riva, this privileges led to the illegal spying which enabled American intelligence agencies to make a map of the Mexican political world, which (according to him) is demonstrated in many documents where the main concern is the political stability and future of Mexico, and the subsequent spying carried on Mr. Peña while he was running for office. He then criticized Mr. Calderón request to Mr. Peña to investigate the spying carried on his e-mail and his cabinet members e-mails and declared that Calderón should have done that when the first allegations of illegal spying came out in 2009-2010. On October 22, 2013, CNNMéxico published on its website that Calderón avoided sending sensitive information through his e-mail, to outsmart spies, and when realized phone calls with other cabinet members, spoke in code. On October 23, 2013, the Secretary of the Interior, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, announced that, by presidential mandate, a profund investigation would be carried on the illegal spying done towards Calderón.<ref name=\"http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2013/10/23/924773\"></ref>\n\nThroughout his office, Calderón has been awarded several honors from foreign nations.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976353", "title": "Obstructive sleep apnea", "text": "Obstructive sleep apnea\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial obstructions of the upper airway during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation. In the Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome, the episodes of decreased breathing are called \"hypopnea\" and its definition requires a ≥30% drop in flow for 10 seconds or longer, associated with ≥3% oxygen desaturation. The episodes of breathing cessations are called \"apneas\" (literally, \"without breath\") and to be defined, a ≥90% drop in flow for 10 seconds or longer must be assessed and associated with ≥3% oxygen desaturation, or an arousal.\n\nIndividuals with OSA are rarely aware of difficulty breathing, even upon awakening. It is often recognized as a problem by others who observe the individual during episodes or is suspected because of its effects on the body. OSA is commonly accompanied with snoring. The terms obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome are used to refer to OSA when it is associated with symptoms during the daytime (e.g. excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased cognitive functions). Symptoms may be present for years or even decades without identification, during which time the individual may become conditioned to the daytime sleepiness and fatigue associated with significant levels of sleep disturbance. Individuals who generally sleep alone are often unaware of the condition, without a regular bed-partner to notice and make them aware of the signs.\n\nAs the muscle tone of the body ordinarily relaxes during sleep, and the airway at the throat is composed of walls of soft tissue, which can collapse, it is not surprising that breathing can be obstructed during sleep. Although a minor degree of OSA is considered to be within the bounds of normal sleep, and many individuals experience episodes of OSA at some point in life, a small percentage of people have chronic, severe OSA.\n\nMany people experience episodes of OSA for only a short period. This can be the result of an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe infectious mononucleosis. Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms.\n\nIn the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), Obstructive Sleep Apnea is classified amongst the Sleep Related Breathing Disorders and is divided in two categories, namely adult OSA and pediatric OSA. Obstructive Sleep Apnea is differentiated from central sleep apnea (CSA), which is characterized by changes in the respiratory cycle during sleep but without the effort to breath during the apnea. The respiratory effort must then be assessed in order to correctly classify the apnea as obstructive given the specificity of the diaphragmatic activity in this condition: the inspiratory effort is continued or increased through the entire episode of absent airflow. When hypopneas are present alongside apneas, the term Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea is used and when it is associated with daytime sleepiness and other daytime symptoms, it is called Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome. To be categorized as obstructive, the hypopnea must meet one or more of the following symptoms: (1) snoring during the event, (2) increased oronasal flow flattening, and/or (3) thoraco-abdominal paradoxical respiration during the event. If none of them are present during the event, then it is categorized as central hypopnea.\n\nCommon symptoms of OSA include unexplained daytime sleepiness, restless sleep, and loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps). Less common symptoms are morning headaches; insomnia; trouble concentrating; mood changes such as irritability, anxiety and depression; forgetfulness; increased heart rate and/or blood pressure; decreased sex drive; unexplained weight gain; increased urination and/or nocturia; frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease; and heavy night sweats.\n\nThe hallmark symptom of OSA syndrome in adults is excessive daytime sleepiness. Typically, an adult or adolescent with severe long-standing OSA will fall asleep for very brief periods in the course of usual daytime activities if given any opportunity to sit or rest. This behavior may be quite dramatic, sometimes occurring during conversations with others at social gatherings.\n\nThe hypoxia (absence of oxygen supply) related to OSA may cause changes in the neurons of the hippocampus and the right frontal cortex. Research using neuro-imaging revealed evidence of hippocampal atrophy in people suffering from OSA. They found that OSA can cause problems in mentally manipulating non-verbal information, in executive functions and working memory. This repeated brain hypoxia is also considered to be a cause of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nDiagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is significantly more common among people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their sleeping partner since individuals with obstructive sleep apnea are often unaware of the condition. There is a stigma associated with loud snoring, and it is not considered a feminine trait. Consequently, females are less likely to be told by their partners that they snore, or to admit it to themselves or doctors. Furthermore, CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines are also perceived negatively by females, and less likely to be utilized to their full extent in this group.\n\nAlthough this so-called \"hypersomnolence\" (excessive sleepiness) may also occur in children, it is not at all typical of young children with sleep apnea. Toddlers and young children with severe OSA instead ordinarily behave as if \"over-tired\" or \"hyperactive.\" Adults and children with very severe OSA also differ in typical body \"habitus\". Adults are generally heavy, with particularly short and heavy necks. Young children, on the other hand, are generally not only thin but may have \"failure to thrive\", where growth is reduced. Poor growth occurs for two reasons: the work of breathing is intense enough that calories are burned at high rates even at rest, and the nose and throat are so obstructed that eating is both tasteless and physically uncomfortable. OSA in children, unlike adults, is often caused by obstructive tonsils and adenoids and may sometimes be cured with tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nThis problem can also be caused by excessive weight in children. In this case, the symptoms are more like the symptoms adults feel such as restlessness, exhaustion, etc. If adenotonsillar hypertrophy remains the most common cause of OSA in children, obesity can also play a role in the pathophysiology of upper airway obstruction during sleep which can lead to OSA, making obese children more likely to develop the condition. The recent epidemic increase of obesity prevalence has thus contributed to changes in the prevalence and in the characteristics of pediatric OSA, the severity of OSA being proportional to the degree of obesity. Obesity leads to the narrowing of upper airway structure due to fatty infiltration and fat deposits in the anterior neck region and cervical structures. Alongside with the additional weight loading on the respiratory system, it increases the risk of pharyngeal collapsibility while reducing the intrathoracic volume and diaphragm excursion. Moreover, excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from sleep fragmentation can decrease physical activity and thus lead to weight gain (by sedentary habits or increased food intake to overcome somnolence). The obesity-related obstruction of upper airway structure has led some authors to distinguish between two types of OSA in children: type I is associated with marked lymphadenoid hypertrophy without obesity and type II is first associated with obesity and with milder upper airway lymphadenoid hyperplasia. The two types of OSA in children can results in different morbidities and consequences. Studies have shown that weight loss in obese adolescents can reduce sleep apnea and thus the symptoms of OSA.\n\nChildren with OSA may experience learning and memory deficits and OSA has also been linked to lowered childhood IQ scores.\n\nMost cases of OSA are believed to be caused by: \n\nSome adults with OSA are obese. Obese adults show an increase in pharyngeal tissue which cause respiratory obstruction during sleep. Adults with normal body mass indices (BMIs) often have decreased muscle tone causing airway collapse and sleep apnea. Sleeping on the supine position is also a risk factor for OSA. The supine sleeping position generates mandibular retraction and tongue collapse which constitutes an anatomical basis for respiratory obstruction during sleep.\n\nOSA and recurrent tonsillitis (RT) are different in their mechanism and outcome.\n\nOld age is often accompanied by muscular and neurological loss of muscle tone of the upper airway. Decreased muscle tone is also temporarily caused by chemical depressants; alcoholic drinks and sedative medications being the most common. The permanent premature muscular tonal loss in the upper airway may be precipitated by traumatic brain injury, neuromuscular disorders, or poor adherence to chemical and or speech therapy treatments.\n\nIndividuals with decreased muscle tone and increased soft tissue around the airway, and structural features that give rise to a narrowed airway are at high risk for OSA. Men, in which the anatomy is typified by increased mass in the torso and neck, are at increased risk of developing sleep apnea, especially through middle age and later. Women suffer typically less frequently and to a lesser degree than do men, owing partially to physiology, but possibly also to differential levels of progesterone. Prevalence in post-menopausal women approaches that of men in the same age range. Women are at greater risk for developing OSA during pregnancy.\n\nOSA also appears to have a genetic component; those with a family history of it are more likely to develop it themselves. Lifestyle factors such as smoking may also increase the chances of developing OSA as the chemical irritants in smoke tend to inflame the soft tissue of the upper airway and promote fluid retention, both of which can result in narrowing of the upper airway. Cigarette may also have an impact due to a decline of blood nicotine levels, which alters sleep stability. Smokers thus show a higher risk to develop OSA, but the effect of cigarette on increased OSA is reversible with the cessation of smoking. Children exposed to cigarette smoke may also develop OSA as the lymphadenoid tissue will proliferate excessively in contact of the irritants. An individual may also experience or exacerbate OSA with the consumption of alcohol, sedatives, or any other medication that increases sleepiness as most of these drugs are also muscle relaxants. Allergic rhinitis and asthma have also been shown to be implicated in the increased prevalence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSA.\n\nThere are patterns of unusual facial features that occur in recognizable syndromes. Some of these craniofacial syndromes are genetic, others are from unknown causes. In many craniofacial syndromes, the features that are unusual involve the nose, mouth, and jaw, or resting muscle tone, and put the individual at risk for OSA syndrome.\n\nDown syndrome is one such syndrome. In this chromosomal abnormality, several features combine to make the presence of obstructive sleep apnea more likely. The specific features of Down syndrome that predispose to obstructive sleep apnea include relatively low muscle tone, narrow nasopharynx, and large tongue. Obesity and enlarged tonsils and adenoids, conditions that occur commonly in the western population, are much more likely to be obstructive in a person with these features than without them. Obstructive sleep apnea does occur even more frequently in people with Down syndrome than in the general population. A little over 50% of all people with Down syndrome suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, and some physicians advocate routine testing of this group.\n\nIn other craniofacial syndromes, the abnormal feature may actually improve the airway, but its correction may put the person at risk for obstructive sleep apnea \"after\" surgery when it is modified. Cleft palate syndromes are such an example. During the newborn period, all humans are obligate nasal breathers. The palate is both the roof of the mouth and the floor of the nose. Having an open palate may make feeding difficult, but generally, does not interfere with breathing, in fact, if the nose is very obstructed, then an open palate may relieve breathing. There are a number of clefting syndromes in which the open palate is not the only abnormal feature; additionally, there is a narrow nasal passage - which may not be obvious. In such individuals, closure of the cleft palate – whether by surgery or by a temporary oral appliance, can cause the onset of obstruction.\n\nSkeletal advancement in an effort to physically increase the pharyngeal airspace is often an option for craniofacial patients with upper airway obstruction and small lower jaws (mandibles). These syndromes include Treacher Collins syndrome and Pierre Robin sequence. Mandibular advancement surgery is often just one of the modifications needed to improve the airway, others may include reduction of the tongue, tonsillectomy or modified uvulopalatoplasty.\n\nOSA can also occur as a serious post-operative complication that seems to be most frequently associated with pharyngeal flap surgery as compared to other procedures for the treatment of velopharyngeal inadequacy (VPI). In OSA, recurrent interruptions of respiration during sleep are associated with temporary airway obstruction. Following pharyngeal flap surgery, depending on size and position, the flap itself may have an \"obturator\" or obstructive effect within the pharynx during sleep, blocking ports of airflow and hindering effective respiration. There have been documented instances of severe airway obstruction, and reports of post-operative OSA continues to increase as healthcare professionals (i.e. physicians, speech language pathologists) become more educated about this possible dangerous condition. Subsequently, in clinical practice, concerns of OSA have matched or exceeded interest in speech outcomes following pharyngeal flap surgery.\n\nThe surgical treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. When velopalatal insufficiency is present, air leaks into the nasopharynx even when the soft palate should close off the nose. A simple test for this condition can be made by placing a tiny mirror on the nose, and asking the subject to say \"P\". This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without fogging a nasal mirror, there is an air leak - reasonable evidence of poor palatal closure. Speech is often unclear due to inability to pronounce certain sounds. One of the surgical treatments for velopalatal insufficiency involves tailoring the tissue from the back of the throat and using it to purposefully cause partial obstruction of the opening of the nasopharynx. This may actually \"cause\" OSA syndrome in susceptible individuals, particularly in the days following surgery, when swelling occurs (see below: Special Situation: Anesthesia and Surgery).\n\nFinally, patients with OSA are at an increased risk of many perioperative complications when they are present for surgery, even if the planned procedure is not on the head and neck. Guidelines intended to reduce the risk of perioperative complications have been published.\n\nThere are 3 levels of consequences: physiologic, intermediate and clinical. The physiologic consequences contain hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation or hyperoxia. The intermediate results regroup inflammation, pulmonary vasoconstriction, general metabolic dysfunction, oxidation of proteins and lipids or increased adiposity. The clinical repercussions are composed by pulmonary hypertension, accidents, obesity, diabetes, different heart diseases or hypertension.\n\nObstructive Sleep Apnea is the most common Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and affects up to 11% of children born at term – it is even more common (3 to 6 times more) in children born pre-term. As a SDB, OSA in children can lead to several adverse consequences, also in the long-term with consequences lasting into adulthood. The implications of OSA in children are complex and cover a large scope of consequences: when it is left untreated, OSA can lead to morbidity affecting many different domains of life (organs, body systems, behavioral disturbance, depression, decreased quality of life, etc.). Therefore, nocturnal symptoms indicating the presence of OSA (e.g. snoring, gasping, restless sleep and excessive energy used to breath during sleep) are associated with daytime symptoms such as concentration and learning difficulties and irritability, neurocognitive development impairment, decreased school performance and behavior difficulties. For example, SDB such as OSA contribute to hyperactive behavior that can lead to the diagnosis and treatment of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, once the SDB is treated, the hyperactive behavior can improve, and the treatment can be stopped. Obesity also has an impact on the consequences of OSA and lead to different manifestations or severity. Studies have shown that, contrary to adults, children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing are able to maintain cerebral oxygenation. However, the condition still has effects on the brain and can lead to adverse neurocognitive and behavioral sequelae. It is particularly concerning as those consequences happen while the brain is still developing. The degree to which the sleep is disturbed and fragmented has been significantly linked to the severity of the consequences, the latter having the possibility to decrease once the sleep is improved. It is more the disruption of sleep processes than the total amount of sleep the child experience that generates the adverse consequences on the child's daytime functioning; it contributes to the hyperactivity for example.\n\nNocturnal sleep fragmentation has been linked to neurocognitive impairments, therefore, the identification of SDB such as OSA is crucial in children, those impairments having the possibility to be reversible with the appropriate treatment for the sleep disorder. The neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunctions commonly present in children with OSA include the following: hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggressive behaviors, low social and communication abilities and reduced adaptive skills. \nChildren with OSA commonly show cognitive deficits, resulting in attention and concentration difficulties, as well as lower academic performance and IQ. Poor academic performances have been linked to OSA and suggested to result from cortical and sympathetic arousals and hypoxemia which affects memory consolidation. A study with Indian children affected with OSA has shown poor school grades, including mathematics, science, language and physical education. This study allowed to see the overall impact of OSA on learning abilities associated with language or numeracy skills, and physical development. It has been suggested that the deficits in academic performance related to OSA could be mediated through reduced executive functions and/or language skills, those domains contributing highly to learning abilities and behavior. The deficits in school performance can nevertheless be improved if adenotonsillectomy is performed on children to treat the OSA. It is thus crucial to identify the OSA for children with school difficulties; many cases remaining unnoticed. \nAs studies have shown that learning skills and behaviors can be improved if the OSA is treated, the neurocognitive and behavioral deficits are thus at least partly reversible. This reversible dimension has been postulated to be negatively correlated to the duration of the symptoms, which would mean that the longer the OSA is left untreated, the less reversible are the consequences.\n\nSimilarly to adults, OSA in children is linked to a higher risk for cardiovascular morbidities, due to increased sympathetic activity and impaired cardiac autonomic control. Amongst the cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from OSA, we can find systemic hypertension and blood pressure dysregulation (elevated blood pressure, or variability of the blood pressure for example). The variability of the blood pressure has been shown to be correlated with the severity of the symptoms such as the frequency of the apnea and hypopnea. Pulmonary hypertension is also common amongst the cardiovascular problems resulting from OSA. Children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing also show a faster heart rate during wakefulness and during sleep. \nIn adult patients, OSA has been shown to be associated with insulin resistance. In children, metabolic consequences of OSA are complicated to assess as they can also be associated to puberty and/or obesity (if present). However, when OSA is associated with obesity, the interaction of the two conditions can lead to metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance and altered lipidemia, liver disease, abdominal adiposity and metabolic syndrome. Obesity interact with those effects.\n\nChildren with OSA also show a higher risk for nocturnal enuresis and it is hypothesized to be caused by an excessive production of urine, impaired performance of the bladder and urethra or an inability to suppress the nocturnal bladder contraction, due to a failure to arouse. The risk for nocturnal enuresis increases with the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing: the more respiratory events per hour of sleep, the higher is the risk for nocturnal enuresis. Obesity may also play a role as it is associated with OSA and with nocturnal diuresis (due to unhealthy diet). The interaction between OSA and obesity might thus result in nocturnal enuresis. Considering the high prevalence of nocturnal enuresis amongst children with sleep-disordered breathing, it is important to consider the latter in the differential diagnosis of nocturnal enuresis as the treatment of the sleep disorder might have a favourable therapeutic effect on the enuresis. For example, an adenotonsillectomy performed to reduce OSA has a positive impact on nocturnal enuresis. A study has shown that this surgery has 60–75% chance to resolve the nocturnal enuresis completely, and 80–85% chance to reduce its symptoms alongside others symptoms of OSA.\n\nContrary to adults, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is not the most commonly reported symptoms in children with OSA. However, using objective questionnaires, it is possible to notice that the frequency of EDS in children is higher than what is reported by the parents or caretakers (40–50%). And the risk for EDS is even increased when OSA is associated with obesity. \nDue to all the consequences and symptoms it generates, OSA in children lead to a significant decrease in the quality of life, the decrease being even higher when obesity is present. The quality of life can however be improved with the treatment of OSA. SBD have also been linked to a higher rate of internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression. Indeed, depressive symptoms have shown to be higher in children with OSA, especially in males. Once again, the severity of depressive symptoms is positively correlated with the severity of the SBD. It also interacts with obesity as obese children have higher risk to show depressive symptoms and obesity can cause OSA. The link can also go the other way around with the depression inducing obesity (due to overeating) which worsen the OSA. Adenotonsillectomy can decrease the intensity of the depressive symptoms.\nOther consequences of a disturbed sleep in children with OSA comprise anhedonia increased fatigue and decreased interest in daily activities, which in turn can affect the child's social relationships.\n\nWhile there are some similarities between adults and children, OSA does not have the same consequences in both populations. Examples of similarities are the snoring – which is the most common complaint in both pediatric OSA and OSA in adults – variability of blood pressure and cardiovascular morbidities. A major difference is the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) which is commonly reported in adult OSA, while it is not very common in pediatric OSA. Nevertheless, OSA in adults also implies a large scope of adverse and serious consequences, the latter leading to higher mortality amongst OSA patients. Those consequences are even worsen by common morbidities such as obesity.\n\nSimilarly to children, OSA affects cognitive functions in adults. Meta-analysis have shown that the most common cognitive impairments happen in the domains of attention, verbal and visual delayed long-term memory, visuospatial/constructional abilities and executive functions, such as mental flexibility. The executive functioning – mainly dominated by the prefrontal cortex – being significantly impaired in patients with OSA, it is believed that the prefrontal region and its connectivity are affected by sleep disorders. \nRegarding memory deficits, verbal memory is significantly impaired as patients show difficulties in recalling verbal information immediately as well as with a delay. While meta-analysis have shown no deficits in retention of information for patients with OSA, those impairment in verbal memory may be linked to problems in encoding information. This deficit in encoding of information is also noticed in visuo-spatial memory; however, the visual memory seems to be intact in OSA patients. \nThe cognitive impairments have been suggested to be resulting from sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation, as well as the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with them. More precisely, attention and memory deficits seem to result from sleep fragmentation, while deficits in global cognitive function (executive function, psychomotor function, language abilities) are more related to hypoxia and/or hypercarbia which accompanies the obstructive events during sleep. However, no consistent correlation has been found between the degree of cognitive impairment and the severity of the sleep disturbance or hypoxia.\nThese impairments may improve with an effective treatment for OSA, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.\n\nThe hyperactivity and difficulties in emotional regulation found in children patients are not reported in adults. OSA in adults is nevertheless associated with personality changes and automatic behavior. The biggest impact of OSA is the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), reported in approximately 30% of OSA patients. EDS can be caused by the disturbance of sleep quality, the insufficient sleep duration or the sleep fragmentation and it is responsible for further complications as it may lead to depressive symptoms, impairments of social life and decreased effectiveness at work. Studies have shown that those consequences of EDS can be improved following a CPAP treatment.\n\nOSA in adults is associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular morbidities, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke – OSA might have a role in the etiology of these conditions. Those conditions may lead to increased mortality that an appropriate treatment for OSA may reduce. OSA is often linked with hypertension as it induces an increase in sympathetic activity that can lead to the elevation of blood pressure. The OSA-related hypercapnia has been suggested to be related to this development of hypertension. Treating the OSA may prevent the development of hypertension. \nThe relationship between OSA and excess body weight is complex as obesity is more prevalent amongst OSA patients but can also be a risk factor for the development of OSA – it accounts for 58% of adult cases. Thus, both OSA and obesity (when present) may work synergistically and lead to hyperlipidemia, diabetes, insulin resistance and other symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome itself is often associated with OSA: 74–85% of OSA patients are diagnosed with it. CPAP therapy can lead to an improvement of some of the cardiovascular component of the metabolic syndrome while weight loss is also recommended for its positive effects on OSA consequences and metabolic dysfunctions. An intervention comprising exercise and diet is thus effective for the treatment of OSA as it positively impacts the severity of both obesity symptoms and OSA symptoms.\n\nIndividuals with Type 2 diabetes are often co-diagnosed with OSA, where Type 2 diabetes prevalence rates range between 15% to 30% within the OSA population. The relationship between OSA and Type 2 diabetes could possibly be explained by the fact that OSA-characteristic fragmented sleep and irregular hypoxemia leads to the dysregulated metabolism of glucose in the blood. In particular, many polysomnography studies showed that OSA left untreated worsens glycemic control in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. However, it is possible that the relationship between OSA and Type 2 diabetes is bidirectional since diabetes-related nerve dysfunction may affect the respiratory system and induce breathing disturbances during sleep.\n\nSleep is of major importance for psychological and emotional health. As it is greatly impaired in OSA, this condition is associated with mood disorders and several psychological outcomes, especially depression and anxiety. Therefore, psychological disorders are commonly observed in OSA patients who show a higher prevalence of psychological distress, mostly due to the impaired sleep quality and structure and the repeated episodes of hypoxia. The presence of psychological disorders may also worsen the sleep disorders which implies that the psychopathology may either be a factor or a consequence of the OSA. The adverse consequences of OSA such as cardiovascular comorbidities and metabolic disturbances also play a role on the development of mental disorders, and patients suffering from chronic condition have also been reported to have higher risk to experience depression. In OSA patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, it is crucial to treat the OSA as it may reduce the psychiatric symptoms. \nSome cases of OSA are caused by nasal obstruction which has also been related to psychological problems due to an altered ratio of calcium and magnesium in brain cells. Nasal obstruction can thus aggravate the psychological health of OSA patients. Nasal surgery for those patients might decrease the OSA severity and improve the psychological symptoms.\n\nUntreated OSA also leads to a decreased quality of life, difficulties in social functioning, occupational problems and accidents and a greatly increased rate of vehicle accidents. Those serious outcomes of OSA are mostly related to the excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from the sleep fragmentation and highlight the need to provide the patients with appropriate treatment. Effective treatment majorly improves those adverse consequences, including quality of life. \nOSA patients also frequently reports pain disorders such as headache or fibromyalgia, OSA patients showing an increased pain intensity alongside a decreased pain tolerance.\n\nThe normal sleep/wake cycle in adults is divided into REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, and wakefulness. NREM sleep is further divided into Stages 1, 2 and 3 NREM sleep. The deepest stage (stage 3 of NREM) is required for the physically restorative effects of sleep, and in pre-adolescents, this is the period of release of human growth hormone. NREM stage 2 and REM, which combined are 70% of an average person's total sleep time, are more associated with mental recovery and maintenance. During REM sleep, in particular, muscle tone of the throat and neck, as well as the vast majority of all skeletal muscles, is almost completely attenuated, allowing the tongue and soft palate/oropharynx to relax, and in the case of sleep apnea, to impede the flow of air to a degree ranging from light snoring to complete collapse. In the cases where airflow is reduced to a degree where blood oxygen levels fall, or the physical exertion to breathe is too great, neurological mechanisms trigger a sudden interruption of sleep, called a neurological arousal. These arousals rarely result in complete awakening but can have a significant negative effect on the restorative quality of sleep. In significant cases of OSA, one consequence is sleep deprivation due to the repetitive disruption and recovery of sleep activity. This sleep interruption in stage 3 (also called slow-wave sleep), and in REM sleep, can interfere with normal growth patterns, healing, and immune response, especially in children and young adults.\n\nDiagnosis of OSA is often based on a combination of patient history and tests (lab- or home-based).\nThese tests range, in decreasing order of cost, complexity and tethering of the patient (number and type of channels of data recorded), from lab-attended full polysomnography (\"sleep study\") down to single-channel home recording. In the United States, these categories are associated with insurance classification from Type I down to Type IV. Reimbursement rules vary among European countries. In a systematic review of published evidence, the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2017 concluded that there was uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools for OSA, and recommended that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults.\n\nThe diagnosis of OSA syndrome is made when the patient shows recurrent episodes of partial and complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep resulting in hypopnea and apneas – hypopnea being the reduction of airflow and apnea its complete cessation, both despite active efforts to breathe. To define the severity of the condition, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) or the Respirratory Distrubance Index (RDI) are used. While the AHI measures the mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, the RDI adds to this measure the respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs). The OSA syndrome is thus diagnosed if AHI > 5 episodes per hour and results in daytime sleepiness and fatigue or when RDI ≥ 15 independently of the symptoms. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, daytime sleepiness is determined as mild, moderate and severe depending on its impact on social life. Daytime sleepiness can be assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a self-reported questionnaire on the propensity to fall asleep or doze off during daytime. Screening tools for OSA itself comprise the STOP questionnaire, the Berlin questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire which has been reported as being a very powerful tool to detect OSA.\n\nAccording to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, there are 4 types of criteria. The first one concerns sleep - excessive sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue or insomnia symptoms. The second and third criteria are about respiration - waking with breath holding, gasping, or choking ; snoring, breathing interruptions or both during sleep. The last criterion revolved around medical issues as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, mood disorder or cognitive impairment. Two levels of severity are distinguished, the first one is determined by a polysomnography or home sleep apnea test demonstrating 5 or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep and the higher levels is determined by 15 or more events. If the events are present less than 5 times per hour, no obstructive sleep apnea is diagnosed.\n\nPolysomnography in diagnosing OSA characterizes the pauses in breathing. As in central apnea, pauses are followed by a relative decrease in blood oxygen and an increase in the blood carbon dioxide. Whereas in central sleep apnea the body's motions of breathing stop, in OSA the chest not only continues to make the movements of inhalation, but the movements typically become even more pronounced. Monitors for airflow at the nose and mouth demonstrate that efforts to breathe are not only present but that they are often exaggerated. The chest muscles and diaphragm contract and the entire body may thrash and struggle.\n\nAn \"event\" can be either an apnea, characterized by complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, or a hypopnea in which airflow decreases by 50 percent for 10 seconds or decreases by 30 percent if there is an associated decrease in the oxygen saturation or an arousal from sleep. To grade the severity of sleep apnea, the number of events per hour is reported as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). An AHI of less than 5 is considered normal. An AHI of 5-15 is mild; 15-30 is moderate and more than 30 events per hour characterizes severe sleep apnea.\n\nIn patients who are at high likelihood of having OSA, a randomized controlled trial found that home oximetry (a non-invasive method of monitoring blood oxygenation) may be adequate and easier to obtain than formal polysomnography. High probability patients were identified by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater and a Sleep Apnea Clinical Score (SACS) of 15 or greater. Home oximetry, however, does not measure apneic events or respiratory event-related arousals and thus does not produce an AHI value.\n\nNumerous treatment options are used in obstructive sleep apnea. Avoiding alcohol and smoking is recommended, as is avoiding medications that relax the central nervous system (for example, sedatives and muscle relaxants). Weight loss is recommended in those who are overweight. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement devices are often used and found to be equally effective. Physical training, even without weight loss, improves sleep apnea. There is insufficient evidence to support widespread use of medications or surgery.\n\nThe most widely used current therapeutic intervention is \"positive airway pressure\" whereby a breathing machine pumps a controlled stream of air through a mask worn over the nose, mouth, or both. The additional pressure holds open the relaxed muscles. There are several variants:\n\n\"Oral appliances\" or splints are often preferred but may not be as effective as CPAP. This device is a mouthguard similar to those used in sports to protect the teeth. It is designed to hold the lower jaw slightly down and forward relative to the natural, relaxed position. This position holds the tongue farther away from the back of the airway and may be enough to relieve apnea or improve breathing.\n\nMany people benefit from sleeping at a \"30-degree elevation\" of the upper body or higher, as if in a recliner. Doing so helps prevent the gravitational collapse of the airway. Sleeping on a side as opposed to sleeping on the back is also recommended.\n\nSome studies have suggested that \"playing a wind instrument\": may reduce snoring and apnea incidents. This may be especially true of double reed instruments.\n\nSurgical treatments to modify airway anatomy, known as sleep surgery, are varied and must be tailored to the specific airway obstruction needs of a patient. Surgery is not considered a frontline treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, as prospective, randomized, comparative clinical evidence against current front line treatments is lacking. For those obstructive sleep apnea sufferers unable or unwilling to comply with front line treatment, a properly selected surgical intervention will be the result of considering an individual's specific anatomy and physiology, personal preference and disease severity. There is little randomized clinical trial evidence for all types of sleep surgery.\n\nThere are a number of different operations that may be performed including:\n\n\nIn the morbidly obese, a major loss of weight (such as what occurs after bariatric surgery) can sometimes cure the condition.\n\nOSA in children is often due to enlarged tonsils and adenoids, because the lymphoid tissue grows fast during young age. Surgical removal of enlarged tonsils (tonsillectomy) and the adenoid (adenoidectomy) are currently first line treatment among children with OSA. The operation is a common procedure but in the most extreme cases, children with severe OSA requires special precautions before, surgery (see \"Surgery and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome\" below). In some countries, a milder surgical procedure called tonsillotomy is used to remove the protruding tonsillar tissue, a method associated with less pain and lower risk of postoperative hemorrhage.\n\nFor patients who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 granted pre-market approval for an upper airway stimulation system that senses respiration and delivers mild electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve in order to increase muscle tone at the back of the tongue so it will not collapse over the airway. The device includes a handheld patient controller to allow it to be switched on before sleep and is powered by an implantable pulse generator, similar to one used for cardiac rhythm management. Approval for this active implantable neuromodulation device was preceded by a clinical trial whose results were published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\".\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA), which is conceptually analogous in some ways to surgery, uses low frequency (300 kHz to 1 MHz) radio wave energy to target tissue, causing coagulative necrosis. RFA achieves its effects at 40 °C to 70 °C unlike other electrosurgical devices which require 400 °C to 600 °C for efficacy.\n\nSubsequent evaluations of safety and efficacy have led to the recognition of RFA by the American Academy of Otolaryngology as a somnoplasty treatment option in selected situations for mild to moderate OSA, but the evidence was judged insufficient for routine adoption by the American College of Physicians.\n\nRFA has some potential advantages in carefully selected medical settings, such as intolerance to the CPAP device. For example, when adherence is defined as greater than four hours of nightly use, 46% to 83% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are non-adherent with CPAP for a variety of reasons, including discomfort while sleeping.\n\nRFA is usually performed in an outpatient setting, using either local anesthetics or conscious sedation anesthesia, the procedure itself typically lasting under 3 minutes. The targeted tissue, such as tongue or palate, is usually approached through the mouth without the need for incisions, although occasionally the target is approached through the neck using assisted imaging. If the tongue is being targeted, this can be done from either dorsal or ventral side. Complications include ulceration, infection, nerve weakness or numbness and swelling. These complications occur in less than 1% of procedures.\n\nEvidence is insufficient to support the use of medications to treat obstructive sleep apnea. This includes the use of fluoxetine, paroxetine, acetazolamide, and tryptophan among others.\n\nRecent studies are trying to investigate cannabinoids as a treatment for OSA, especially dronabinol which is a synthetic form of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Cannabis is known to influence sleep, for example it can reduce sleep onset latency, however, results are not consistent. Studies about dronabinol have shown positive impact on the OSA, as they observed a reduced AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) and an increased self-reported sleepiness (the objective sleepiness being unaffected). However, more evidence are needed as many effects of those substances remain unknown, especially the effects of a long-term intake. The effect on sleepiness and weight gain are particularly of concern. Because of uncertainty about its effects and a lack of consistent evidence, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not approve the use of medical cannabis for the treatment of OSA.\n\nEvidence to support oral appliances/functional orthopedic appliances in children is insufficient with very low evidence of effect. However, the oral appliances/functional orthopedic appliances may be considered in specified cases as an auxiliary in the treatment of children who have craniofacial anomalies which are risk factors of apnea.\n\nStroke and other cardiovascular disease are related to OSA and those under the age of 70 have an increased risk of early death. Persons with sleep apnea have a 30% higher risk of heart attack or death than those unaffected. In severe and prolonged cases, increased in pulmonary pressures are transmitted to the right side of the heart. This can result in a severe form of congestive heart failure known as \"cor pulmonale\". Diastolic function of the heart also becomes affected. Elevated arterial pressure (i.e., hypertension) can be a consequence of OSA syndrome. When hypertension is caused by OSA, it is distinctive in that, unlike most cases (so-called essential hypertension), the readings do \"not\" drop significantly when the individual is sleeping (non-dipper) or even increase (inverted dipper).\n\nWithout treatment, the sleep deprivation and lack of oxygen caused by sleep apnea increases health risks such as cardiovascular disease, aortic disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm), high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, clinical depression, weight gain, obesity, and even death.\n\nOSA is associated with cognitive impairment, including deficits in inductive and deductive reasoning, attention, vigilance, learning, executive functions, and episodic and working memory. OSA is associated with increased risk for developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and has been associated with neuroanatomical changes (reductions in volumes of the hippocampus, and gray matter volume of the frontal and parietal lobes) which can however be at least in part reversed with CPAP treatment.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of 24 epidemiological studies on the prevalence of OSA in the general population aged 18 and older revealed that for ≥5 apnea events per hour, OSA prevalence ranged from 9% to 38%, specifically ranging from 13% to 33% in men and 6% to 19% in women, while in the population aged 65 and older, OSA prevalence was as high as 84%, including 90% in men and 78% in women. Nevertheless, for ≥15 apnea events per hour, OSA prevalence ranged from 6% to 17%, and almost 49% prevalence rate in the older population aged 65 and older. Moreover, a higher BMI is also linked to a higher prevalence of OSA, where a 10% increase in body weight led to a 6-fold risk of OSA in obese men and women.\n\nHowever, OSA is underdiagnosed as it is not always accompanied by daytime sleepiness which can leave the sleep-disordered breathing unnoticed. The prevalence of OSA with daytime sleepiness is thus estimated to affect 3% to 7% of men and 2% to 5% of women, and the disease is common in both developed and developing countries. OSA prevalence increases with age and is most commonly diagnosed in individuals over 65 years old, with estimations ranging from 22.1% to 83.6%. The prevalence has drastically increased the past decades mainly explained by the obesity epidemic currently observed.\n\nMen are more affected by OSA than women but, the phenomenology differs between both genders. Snoring and witnessed apnea are more frequent among men but insomnia for example is more frequent among women. The OSA frequency increase with age for the women. The mortality is higher for women.\n\nSome studies report that it is more frequent among the Hispanic and African American population than among white population.\n\nIf studied carefully in a sleep lab by polysomnography (formal \"sleep study\"), it is believed that approximately 1 in 5 American adults would have at least mild OSA.\n\nNeurostimulation is currently being studied as a method of treatment; an implanted hypoglossal nerve stimulation system received European CE Mark (Conformité Européenne) approval in March 2012. Also being studied are exercises of the muscles around the mouth and throat through activities such as playing the didgeridoo.\n"}

It was founded in 1912 and it has no other location or campus in the country.\n\nSince its foundation in 1912 it has had as exclusive mission the teaching of law, under the principle and the respect the teacher's academic freedoms, outside of any kind of cult, political or religious ideology. Alumni of this school practice law in the private sector, as well as in the public sector, among every level of government, in the three branches of government and constitutionally autonomous organisms, including two former Mexican presidents, and several former and current Supreme Court ministers.\n\nSome of the fundamental characteristics of the school is that it is sponsored by the board of the Illustrious and National Bar Association of México (\"Ilustre y Nacional Colegio de Abogados de México\", in Spanish), and, in accordance with the \"Regulatory Decree of Free Schools\" (\"Decreto Regulatorio de Escuelas Libres\", in Spanish) of October 22, 1929, on its first article it defines free schools as the teaching institutions sustained by private efforts and resources, that have for purpose to provide artistic, middle school, high school, or professional education; and on article 7 establishes that the concession granted by the then acting president, Emilio Portés Gil constituted the legal title of the authorized free school, giving the school a definitive right which cannot be canceled, having plain right to issue its diplomas according to its study plans, without the need of the recognition of the official validity of studies granted by the Public Education Secretary. Being the Escuela Libre de Derecho the only one in its type subject to said privilege régime.\n\nAnother characteristic of this school is that its teachers do not charge salary or monetary compensation whatsoever, which is why students only make a symbolic payment used to cover the school expenses.\n\nThe motto for Escuela Libre de Derecho is \"\"Ius neque inflecti gratia, Neque perfringi potentia, Neque adulterari pecunia debet\"\", which traduced from Latin means \"law cannot be influenced by favor, seduced by power nor adulterated by pecuniary favor\".\n\nThe building of Escuela Libre de Derecho counts with an access from the street Doctor José María Vértiz and another one from Arcos de Belén Avenue, said access has a hall with red walls that has transcribed in golden letters the article 6 of the schools reglamentation that states: \"the order and discipline of the School are entrusted to the honor of its students and its teachers\", emphasizing that the responsibility of the order inside and outside of the Institution rests in its student body and teachers, who always have in consideration that in Escuela Libre de Derecho everyone act in good faith.\n\nEscuela Libre de Derecho is the only professional teaching institution in the country where courses last a full year and it counts with an evaluation system consisting in a unique final exam for every course, consisting in verbal replies presented upon a jury integrated by, at least, three sinodles who shall be able to practice law by having a lawyer degree. This system is based in having a maximum number of courses a student can fail each year, as long it does not exceeds five courses, failing a sixth course would be cause for definitive discharge from the Institution; the ordinary time to conclude studies in this Institution and according with its study plan is of five years, but it cannot be extended by more than two years, since it would cause definitive discharge of the student.\n\nThe grades assigned by the examining jury in each course are unappealable. Once all the courses required by the Institution are approved, the student shall present a grade exam in which a thesis is presented and a practical case solved, in case the examining jury considers the student is apt to approve this exam, the School, under the patronage of the Illustrious and National Bar Association of México will issue the corresponding diploma for the law studies in order to practice law, different from the rest of teaching institutions in Mexico that issue their degrees for bachelor of law; obtaining the alumni form Escuela Libre de Derecho by the Public Education Secretary a lawyer certification.\n\nMexican Presidents\n\nCabinet secretaries\n\nOther\n\nThe Escuela Libre de Derecho was founded on July 24, 1912.

{"id": "1976373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976373", "title": "Butuan", "text": "Butuan\n\n' (pronounced ), officially the ' (; Butuanon: \"Dakbayan hong \"), or simply known as City, is a highly urbanized city and regional center of the Caraga Region, . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt served as the former capital of the Rajahnate of Butuan before 1001 until about 1521. The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, Mindanao, sprawling across the Agusan River. It is bounded to the north, west and south by Agusan del Norte, to the east by Agusan del Sur and to the northwest by Butuan Bay.\n\nButuan City was the capital of the province of Agusan del Norte until 2000, when Republic Act 8811 transferred the capital to Cabadbaran City. For statistical and geographical purposes, Butuan City is grouped with Agusan del Norte but governed administratively independent from the province while legislatively administered by the province's 1st congressional district.\n\nThe name \"Butuan\" is believed to have originated from the sour fruit locally called \"batuan\". Other etymological sources say that it comes from a certain Datu Buntuan, a chieftain who once ruled over areas of the present-day city.\n\nAccording to Datu Makalipay, Butuan was named after the wife of Datu Balansag who was the \"tiniente de barangay\" of the area before.\n\nButuan, during the pre-colonial times, was known as the Rajahnate of Butuan, an Indianized kingdom known for its metallurgic industry and sophisticated naval technology. The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the Champa civilisation and the Srivijaya Empire.\n\nBy 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the Song dynasty of China. The \"History of Song\" recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the Chinese imperial court, and the rajahnate was described as a small Hindu country with a Buddhist monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with Champa. The mission, under a king named \"Kiling\", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court. However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the Yuan dynasty.\n\nEvidence of these trading links are in the discovery of 11 balangay boats around Ambangan in Barangay Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in Southeast Asia. Other evidences of the post are the discovery of a village in Libertad that specializes in gold, deformed skulls similar to reports in Sulawesi, and the discovery of many artifacts by locals and treasure hunters.\n\nOn March 31, 1521, an Easter Sunday, Ferdinand Magellan ordered a mass to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the Andalusian chaplain of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been marooned at Patagonia with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at Puerto San Julián. Conducted near the shores of the island, the \"Holy First Mass\" marked the birth of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines. Rajah Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be Spanish colony to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.\n\nControversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass—whether it was held in Limasawa, Leyte in Masao, Butuan City, in the hidden isle made up of barangays Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan, in the latest discovered site in between Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur, the small barangay of Barobo, or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of Agusan River in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from 1521 Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now. Antonio Pigafetta who wrote an eyewitness account of Magellan's voyage described in text and in map a Butuan that stretched from today's Surigao up to the top edge of Zamboanga del Norte.\n\nThe first municipal election in Butuan took place in March 1902 in accordance with Public Law No. 82 which coincided with the American occupation of the place.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, more than half of Butuan, if not all of it, was burned when local guerrilla forces attacked the enemy garrison on 12 March 1943 in the Battle of Butuan. On January 17, 1945, guerrillas attacked Japanese troops on the road between Cabadbaran and Butuan to prevent the Japanese garrison at Butuan from being reinforced. When the guerrillas depleted their ammunition supply, they were forced to retreat. Later in 1945, the Philippine Commonwealth troops in Butuan together with the recognized guerrillas attacked the Japanese forces during the Battle of Agusan. On October 20, 1948, still recovering from the war, the entire municipality was ruined by a fire.\n\nBy the late 1940s to the 1970s, Butuan's industry specialized in timber, earning it the nickname \"Timber City of the South\". The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors to the city, and inspired then-Congressman Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a city.\n\nHowever, by the early 1980s, the logging industry of the city began to decline, although the city was still an economic haven to many investors. The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a Highly Urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of Caraga was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of Agusan del Norte. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to Cabadbaran, however most provincial offices are still located in the city.\n\nButuan City has a land area of , which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the Caraga region.\n\nThe existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23 km), forestland (268 km), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14 km) and other uses (90.242 km). Of the total forestland, 105 km is production forest areas while 167.5 km is protection forest areas.\n\nThe forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,\n\nThe city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.\n\nFilling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.\n\nThe fishing ground of Butuan is the Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.\n\nButuan has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification \"Af\").\n\nButuan is subdivided into 86 barangays and group into 13 districts. Also, barangays 1 thru 26 form the Poblacion (city proper) of Butuan City.\n\nWith a total population of 337,063 in the 2015 census, it has an average density of 413 persons per km, higher than the regional average density of 120 persons per km.\n\nButuan City is the commercial, industrial, and administrative center of Caraga region. It is a strategic trading hub in Northern Mindanao with major roads connecting it to other main cities in the island such as Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Malaybalay, Surigao, and soon, Tandag. It hosts one of the busiest airports in the country, the Bancasi Airport, serving around 525,000 passengers in 2012. Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines are flying to and from Butuan City. Meanwhile, the nearby Nasipit International Port and in-city Masao Port are providing for its shipping and cargo needs.\n\nThe total number of businesses registered in 2013 was 9,619—reflecting a growth of 9.86% and almost 3 times that of the next major Caraga city. New businesses registered numbered 2,032 with a combined capitalization of P504,598,667, an expansion of 75.63 from 2012.\n\nAs further proof of its dynamic economy, Butuan City's local income reached P330,510,000 in 2013 besting other major cities in the country. By 2014, its local income is expected to reach P513,870,000.00 or register a growth of 55%; and total income (including IRA) will be P1,515,970,000. Butuan City was ranked 4th and 16th Most Competitive City for the years 2012 and 2014 by the National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines.\n\nMore than 260 financial institutions are operating in the city such as Metrobank, Banco de Oro, Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank), Philippine National Bank (PNB), Chinabank, EastWest Bank, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank), Security Bank and Maybank. Rural banks are also expanding aggressively. Based on a report from PDIC (as of December 2013), total savings deposit in Butuan City amounted to P18,944,854,000, comprising 45% of the total deposits in Caraga Region. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) opened its regional office here to take advantage of the vibrant gold trading industry in the region. Insurance companies, led by Philam Life, are also present in the city.\n\nThe city's major agricultural produce are rice, bananas, coconuts, poultry, shrimp, and milkfish. Its key industries include rice milling, food processing, wood processing, furniture, fuel distribution, shipbuilding, and construction. The manufacturing sector will soon get a boost as an industrial park is currently being developed. Butuan has also proven to be a haven for renewable energy with investments in solar and hydroelectric power generation pouring in the city.\nButuan is also fast-becoming a cosmopolitan city. Currently, there are three (3) major commercial centers catering its populace. These are Robinsons Place Butuan, Puregold Price Club (both opened in 2013), and Gaisano (Unipace). Leading mall developer, SM, is expected to break ground by the end of 2016 until it will open by early 2020, although some of the mall developers in the Philippines have also expressed their interest in the city such as Gaisano Capital to name a few. 7-Eleven opened its first two stores in the city. Currently, it has eight branches in the city. High-end real estate developers, such as Filinvest and Vista Land, have started their residential projects in the city. The A. Brown Group is also developing another exclusive community with a 9-hole golf course. More low- and medium-cost housing projects are sprouting in the outskirts of the city evident of the city's strong market for shelter. Famous food brands have also opened shops in the city such as Jolibee, McDonald's, Chowking, Dunkin' Donuts, Mister Donut, Greenwich, Mang Inasal, Red Ribbon, Goldilocks, Pizza Hut, Gerry's Grill, Max's Restaurant, Yellow Cab Pizza and Bo's Coffee. KFC has finally opened since December 2016 and Shakey's Pizza reopened its first doors at the new SM Mall by the beginning of 2020 since it relocated from Montilla Blvd. a decade later.\n\nAs for the telecommunications infrastructure of the city, Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, PLDT, PhilCom and Bayantel are able to serve its ever-growing needs.\n\nButuan City is becoming one of the highlights of the tourism programs in the Philippines, as more and more people, both local and foreign, are discovering the wonders and secrets of this ancient and beautiful city. It is customary for any traveler to learn a little bit of history concerning the place that will be visited, and the history of Butuan City is one of the most fascinating. Unlike other lands whose development only began during the Spanish colonization, Butuan was already a progressive and full fledge city centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards. Historical records show that as early as the 10th century, the local people were already engaged in trade and commerce with other nations and cultures, like the Champa (now Vietnam) and the Srivajaya peoples of Java, Indonesia. This is confirmed by the unearthing of several artifacts such as boats used for plying their trade. During the Spanish and American occupation, Butuan continued to make progress and the number of people who were settling increased steadily. A large number of its inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and in fact one of the issues is whether the first mass was actually held in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe local government of Butuan City is headed by an elected Mayor and is considered to be the local chief executive of the city. He exercises the general supervision and control over all programs, projects, services, and activities of the city government. He is then accompanied by the law making body of the city which is called, The Sangguniang Panlungsod headed by the elected Vice Mayor as the presiding officer, together with ten (10) elected Sangguniang Panlungsod Members and the President of the Liga ng mga Barangay as an ex-officio member.\n\n\n\n\nAssociation of Barangay Captains (Liga ng mga Barangay)\n\nSangguniang Kabataan Federation\n\n\n\n\nBeing the regional center of Caraga, Butuan is also the region's center of education. There are two universities in the city. The first, Father Saturnino Urios University, a privately run school founded by Rev. Fr. Urios, S.J. in 1901. The second, the Caraga State University—Main Campus, formerly known as the Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology, is a state-run school founded in 1918. They are among the top two performing universities in the region.\n\nButuan City is known for its education competence. Proof of these are in awards earned. Teachers and school staff of the Butuan Central Elementary School, Butuan City SPED Center and Agusan National High School have large-scale exposure to specialization techniques, as well as seminars and workshops to complement, with partnerships like Philippine-Australia Project on Basic Education (PROBE).\n\nThere are also Chinese schools in the city like the Timber City Academy and Butuan Faith Christian School. National high schools include the Agusan NHS, Tungao NHS, San Vicente NHS, Libertad NHS and Ampayon ISS (Integrated Secondary School). The city is also home of the Butuan City School of Arts and Trades (BCSAT), a specialization school in the fields of arts and in vocational courses.\n\nAs an education hub, Butuan has colleges with a variety of courses. Examples are the Agusan College, Inc., AMA Computer Learning Center (ACLC), Butuan Doctors College, Saint Joseph Institute of Technology, Agusan Business and Arts Foundation, Agusan Institute of Technology, Asian College Foundation, Balite Institute of Technology—Butuan, Butuan City Colleges, Butuan City Liga College, Corjesu Computer College, Elisa R. Ochoa Memorial Northern Mindanao School of Midwifery, Father Urios Institute of Technology of Ampayon, Inc., Grand View College, Holy Child Colleges of Butuan City, Philippine Electronics and Communication Institute of Technology, Saint Peter College Seminary, and the Sunrise Christian College Foundation of the Philippines.\n\nBig private universities like the Ateneo, De La Salle Philippines and Iglesia Ni Cristo-owned New Era University (NEU) have also expressed to put up local branches.\n\nOther schools include Enfant Cheri Study Centre, Rainbow of Angels Learning Center, Solid Rock Shilo Mission Academy, Ampayon Central Elementary School, Angelicum Montessori School, Butuan Grace Christian School, Butuan Christian Community School, Florencio R. Sibayan Central Elementary School, Libertad Central Elementary School, Obrero Elementary School, and the Ong Yiu Central Elementary School.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They started clearing some portions of the wilderness especially in areas near the riverbanks. Several groups of settlers then drove this Aetas to the hinterlands and permanently occupied the place. They named it \"“Malaquing Tubig”\" which literally translates to \"big river\" referring to body of water that cuts through the central portion of their early settlement.\n\nThe Spaniards then colonized the Philippines in 1565. Bauan was established in 1596 as an ecclesiastical unit administered by the order of Saint Agustin with Malaquing Tubig as one of the barrios under its jurisdiction.\n\nHuman population of Malaquing Tubig started to grow and in 1754, Taal Volcano erupted destroying the original Bauan. And before its actual site could have been selected, Malaking Tubig was separated from Bauan. The recognized leaders of Malaquing Tubig then petitioned to the Spanish authorities for the creation of that place as a pueblo which was granted to them on April 26, 1765.\n\nEstablished on April 26, 1765 as the town of \"San José de Malaquing Tubig\", it once formed part of Bauan, and in the new town's establishment, it originally included the land that now makes up the Municipality of Cuenca.\n\nSan Jose is located at .\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nSan Jose is politically subdivided into 33 barangays.\n\nIn the , San Jose had a population of .

It is where a great number of poultry and piggery animals are grown and sold, especially to Metro Manila, where it supplies a significant percentage of poultry products. Most of the San Jose workforce is either directly or indirectly involved in farming. There are also numerous feedmill corporations within its jurisdiction which include WhiteGold, Everlast, Busilac, Wincom, New Golden Mix.\n\nThe Shrine of Saint Joseph the Patriarch located in the town proper is a popular Catholic pilgrimage site. It was once built with cogon and bamboo by Augustinian friars around 1788. The present structure was built on 1812 under the supervision of a botanist Fr. Manuel Blanco. It has single-aisled interior which offers an unobstructed view of the large main altar. The altar is massive, with six rounded columns encircling the image of Saint Joseph. Outside a multi-tiered belfry stands which was built in the latter part of the 19th century; a bridge offers passage to the church over the Malaquing Tubig River.\n\nSan Jose is also home to the Oblates of Saint Joseph Mission and its Minor Seminary, founded by the Saint Joseph Marello. The Oblates were the first Italian congregation to send missionaries to the Philippines. San Jose became their first foreign mission, and is the center of the Vicariate X of the Archdiocese of Lipa.\n\nSan Jose celebrates Sinuam Festival every 25th day of April to commemorate its founding anniversary and to thank its patron for the good performance of the main business in the town which is Poultry.\n\n\n"}

The line-up of Gavin Anderson on drums, Ian Clyne on organ and piano, Gerry Humphrys on vocals and harmonica, Rob Lovett on guitar, and Kim Lynch on bass guitar recorded their early hits. Their signature song, \"The Loved One\" reached number two on Australian singles charts, and was later covered by INXS. In 2001 it was selected as number six on the APRA's list of Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Their debut album, \"The Loved Ones' Magic Box\" was released late in 1967, which included other hit singles, \"Ever Lovin' Man\" and \"Sad Dark Eyes\". They disbanded in October and, although the band's main career lasted only two years, they are regarded as one of the most significant Australian bands of the 1960s. They reformed for a short tour in 1987 which provided the album, \"Live on Blueberry Hill\". Humphrys lived in London from the mid-1970s until his death on 4 December 2005. On 27 October 2010, The Loved Ones were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Loved Ones were formed in Melbourne, Victoria, in October 1965 by Gerry Humphrys (originally from London) on vocals and harmonica, Kim Lynch on bass guitar and Ian Clyne on organ and piano. They were all former members of a trad jazz group, The Red Onion Jazz Band, in which Humphrys played clarinet, and sang, and Lynch played tuba. \"Red Onions Jazz Band\" was released as an eponymous album in 1964 on W&G Records blue label. Following the British Invasion, led by the Beatles' tour of Australia in mid-1964, the band split as the three members wanted to switch to R&B and felt they had drifted towards more mainstream 1940s jazz. The Loved Ones were named after Evelyn Waugh's short and darkly satirical novel \"The Loved One\". To round out the line-up, Humphrys, Lynch and Clyne recruited former Wild Cherries guitarist Rob Lovett. Their first drummer, Terry Nott, was soon followed by Gavin Anderson.\n\nThe Loved Ones became renowned as an exciting, if erratic, live act in a Rolling Stones/Animals mould and rose to prominence in the local club and dance scene. The group's visual impact was heightened by their striking mod stage attire and the band had a strong focal point thanks to the charismatic stage presence, saturnine good looks and growling blues-influenced baritone voice of Humphrys, who is widely acknowledged as one of Australia's finest male pop-rock vocalists. The Loved Ones were also one of the first Australian pop bands to use the electric piano (a Hohner pianet) as part of their regular stage set-up and their distinctive keyboard-based sound set them apart from most of their contemporaries.\n\nEarly in 1966, they signed to the In Records label, a subsidiary of W&G Records. Their debut hit was \"The Loved One\", which reached number two on the Sydney Top 40 singles charts in May. The song was written by Clyne, Humphrys and Lovett. It has a complex double rhythm, which is joined by hand clapping, and Humphrys' bluesy and soaring vocals. According to Lovett, the inspiration for the hand claps came from Clyne, who went to a nightclub to talk to another musician: Director, Peter Lamb filmed the group performing it for a documentary on mid-1960s Melbourne, \"Approximately Panther\" (1966), with \"Go-Set\" writer Doug Panther interviewing other local acts including Lynne Randell and Bobby & Laurie. The song was an Australian Top 20 hit again in 1981 when covered by INXS.\n\nThe Loved Ones' released their second single \"Ever Lovin' Man\" in July 1966, which peaked at number seven on the \"Go-Set\" National Top 40 singles chart in October while \"The Loved One\" was still in the Top 20. To promote their singles, the group appeared on ATV-0 popular music series \"The Go!! Show\" on 24 October to perform, \"The Loved One\", \"Ever Lovin' Man\" and \"More Than Love\".\n\nA cover of Fats Domino's version of \"Blueberry Hill\" was issued in December on a four-track extended play, \"Blueberry Hill\", which reached number 11 on the \"Go-Set\" singles chart. The EP included both \"Ever Lovin' Man\" and \"The Loved One\". After some personal crises, Clyne left and moved to Sydney; he was replaced by Treva Richards (ex Delta Set) on piano and organ in September. After leaving The Loved Ones, Clyne played in The Black Pearls, The Ram Jam Big Band, Excalibur, Levi Smith's Clefs and Chain; he was in Aunty Jack's backing group The Gong in the mid-1970s.\n\n\"Sad Dark Eyes\" followed in February 1967, which peaked in the Top 20. This was the first single with Richards' input. \"A Love Like Ours\" was issued in April and also reached the Top 20. Each captured an emotional intensity and musical inventiveness which marked them out from their peers. On 23 April, they performed at Festival Hall, Melbourne and recorded live versions of \"Ever Lovin’ Man\", \"Sad Dark Eyes\" and \"The Loved One\". They supported the national tour by Eric Burdon and the Animals and Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich in April. In May, Lynch left and they added a new lead guitarist, Danny De Lacy (from Los Angeles), with Lovett moving to bass guitar.\n\nTheir fifth single, \"Love Song\" was released in August but did not chart. They released their debut album, \"The Loved Ones' Magic Box\", in October, which essentially was a collection of the band's singles. W&G Records was unable to co-ordinate releases with the band's touring, The Loved Ones split in late October, two years after they formed. \"The Loved Ones' Magic Box\" is considered a classic recording which enjoys cult status and has reportedly never been out-of-print since it was released.\n\nHumphrys initially managed rock'n'rollers The Valentines (with vocalists Bon Scott and Vince Lovegrove). He formed Gerry and The Joy Band in 1971, a floating aggregation that, at times, included members of Daddy Cool and The Aztecs. At that time he moved to the suburban fringes of Sandringham and hosted many functions at his Spring Street residence.\nHe went on to bigger things by hosting the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival in 1972. In 1973 he returned to London in an unsuccessful attempt to save his failing marriage, giving up his music career to become a psychiatric nurse. Lovett formed a vocal trio, The Virgil Brothers, with Peter Doyle and Malcolm McGee (Wild Cherries, Python Lee Jackson) in 1968. The Virgil Brothers were managed by Lovett's wife, journalist Lily Brett, and released a number of singles and toured the UK before splitting up in 1970. In the early '70s Lovett's songs were recorded by Peter Doyle in The New Seekers. In the early 1990s Lovett joined The Fudds, alongside Chris Dyson, Stewart MacFarlane, Vic Mavridis and Peter Robertson. They released several albums over the following seven years. Anderson also moved into management, looking after The Party Machine until they split in 1969; he relocated to London and then New York. In 1981 he formed a PR company, Gavin Anderson & Company, which became a large and successful strategic communications business with headquarters in New York and offices throughout the world. Nott joined the psychedelic band, Grunewald Burlesque, and later became an architect in Melbourne. After Lynch left the band he turned to painting. Richards married and moved to Adelaide to raise a family. He lived for a number of years in the former Barr-Smith 'Auchendarroch' property in the Adelaide Hills.\n\nFollowing a resurgence of interest in The Loved Ones, prompted in part by the INXS cover of \"The Loved One\", they reformed for a live tour in September 1987. The line-up of Clyne, Humphrys, Lovett and Lynch, was augmented by Melbourne drummer Peter Luscombe sitting in for Anderson. The album \"Live on Blueberry Hill\" followed on Mushroom Records. In 1999, author Richard Miles wrote \"More Than a Loved One: The Musical Career of Gerry Humphrys\". In 2000, filmmaker Nigel Buesst directed the documentary, \"Gerry Humphrys – the Loved One\". The film includes interviews with band mates, performance footage and Buesst's efforts to track down and interview Humphrys in his suburban home in south London.\n\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation TV series, \"Long Way to the Top\", was broadcast in August 2001. The Loved Ones featured on \"Episode 2: Ten Pound Rocker 1963–1968\" where they are described as having \"quirky rhythms and charismatic lead singer Gerry Humphries , the Loved Ones soon gained a serious cult status\". The TV series inspired the Long Way to the Top national concert tour during August–September 2002, which featured a host of the best Australian acts of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Although invited onto the tour, the band had to decline as Humphrys had to remain in the UK.\n\nHumphrys remained in London where he died of a heart attack on 4 December 2005, he has three daughters. On 27 October 2010, The Loved Ones were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. On hearing of their induction the band said \"We were kids who discovered we could actually write and play music we believed in ... and other kids liked it too.\" Attending in person were Clyne, Lynch and Richards, with Anderson (a resident of New York) and Lovett (London) unavailable. They were inducted by concert promoter, Michael Chugg, while rocker Diesel performed their signature tune, \"The Loved One\". In October 2010, \"Magic Box\" (1967) was listed in the book, \"100 Best Australian Albums\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mitchell, United States Attorney General under President Richard Nixon. She became a controversial figure with her outspoken comments about the government at the time of the Watergate scandal.\n\nMartha Elizabeth Beall Jennings Mitchell was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on September 2, 1918. She grew up the only child of cotton broker George V. Beall and drama teacher Arie Beall (née Ferguson). Living in a rural area, Mitchell's friends lived far away, and she recalled in a \"Saturday Evening Post\" interview that she mostly grew up playing with the children of her \"mammy,\" or African-American domestic worker, who lived with the family on the farm. As a little girl, she liked to sing, particularly as a member of her church choir. Her mother hoped she would become an opera singer. As a child, she studied singing around the country and, at Northwestern, she studied piano.\n\nFor the first six years of her education, she attended a private school, switching to a public one during the Great Depression. She graduated from Pine Bluff High School in 1937. Under her high school yearbook picture was the quote, \"Love its gentle warble, I love its gentle flow, I love to wind my tongue up, And I love to let it go.\" She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, with hopes of studying premed; she had wanted to be a pediatrician when she grew up, but blamed her Southern accent for difficulty with learning Greek and Latin. Instead, she became a Red Cross Nurse's Aide in one of the organization's very first chapters, and claimed that, at one time, she had given more hours to the service than anyone else in the country. She eventually transferred to the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and finally the University of Miami, At university, she joined Chi Omega and was president of Sigma Iota Chi. She was fascinated by the arts, and had dreams of becoming an actress, but her family would not allow it. She ultimately received a BA in history. After graduation, she worked for about a year as a seventh-grade teacher in Mobile, Alabama, before leaving the profession, saying she \"despised\" it. She returned to Pine Bluff in 1945 and, after World War II, she began work as a secretary at the Pine Bluff Arsenal. She was soon transferred (along with her boss, Brigadier General Augustin Mitchell Prentiss) to Washington, D.C..\n\nIn Washington, she met Clyde Jennings, Jr., a US Army officer from Lynchburg, Virginia. They married on October 5, 1946 in Pine Bluff and moved to Rye, New York. Soon after they wed, he was honorably discharged, and he took up work as a traveling handbag salesman. By Jennings, she had a son, Clyde Jay Jennings, on November 2, 1947. Jennings, however, spent a lot of time away from home, and (according to Mitchell) it led to the couple's separation on May 18, 1956 and eventual divorce on August 1, 1957.\n\nShe once said as soon as she met John N. Mitchell, she was \"impressed with his suaveness and intellect,\" and the couple married on December 30, 1957, settling in Rye, New York. John worked as a lawyer in Manhattan, earning a year, and the couple purchased a home on the grounds of the Apawamis Club. On January 10, 1961, the couple had a daughter, Martha Elizabeth, whom they nicknamed Marty. They enrolled their daughter in Stone Ridge Country Day School in Bethesda, Maryland, despite not being Roman Catholics, because of Mitchell's belief that \"the Roman Catholic schools are about the only ones that have discipline.\"\n\nJohn Mitchell and Richard Nixon's professional careers converged when, on New Year's Eve 1966, their law offices combined to become Nixon Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander and Mitchell. Although their status as friends is debated, when Nixon was elected president in 1968, he appointed John Mitchell as his Attorney General. The position necessitated that the family move to Washington DC, and their home in the \"fashionable\" Watergate complex, at the time, was estimated to be worth . Mitchell first came to national attention after she remarked to a television reporter that Washington DC peace demonstrations held in November 1969 reminded her husband of a Russian revolution. The statement, widely viewed as indiscreet, increased her notoriety and coverage in the media. She had the custom of having an evening drink, and then calling reporters with political gossip or information she has gleaned while rifling through her husband's papers or eavesdropping on his conversations. During this time, Mitchell's renown as an outspoken socialite grew, and she made regular appearances on talk shows and variety shows. By the following year, in November 1970, a Gallup poll indicated that 76 percent of Americans recognized who she was, and she made the cover of \"Time\" in an issue about the most influential women of Washington. Her reputation for frank and uncensored talk, generally in support of Republican issues, led to her being nicknamed \"Martha the Mouth\" or \"The Mouth of the South\". \n\nNixon selected John to head the Committee to Re-Elect the President (commonly abbreviated to CRP, or insultingly CREEP) during the 1972 campaign. During the campaign, however, Mitchell had begun to complain to her media contacts that the campaign had engaged in \"dirty tricks\" to win the election. A week before the 1972 burglary of the DNC headquarters in the Watergate office building, the Mitchells had traveled to Newport Beach, California to attend a series of fundraising events. While there, John received a phone call about the incident and immediately held a press conference denying any CRP involvement. John then returned to Washington DC, encouraging his wife to remain in California to enjoy the sunny weather. Meanwhile, however, he enlisted their security guard Steve King (a former FBI agent) to prevent her from learning about the break-in or contacting reporters. Despite these efforts, Martha learned that James W. McCord Jr., the security director of the CRP and her daughter's bodyguard and driver, was among those arrested. This detail conflicted with the White House's official story that the break-in was unrelated to the CRP, and raised her suspicion.\n\nDuring a phone call with Helen Thomas of the United Press, reportedly Mitchell's favorite reporter, Mitchell informed Thomas of her decision to leave her husband until he resigned from the CRP. The phone call, however, abruptly ended. When Thomas called back, the hotel operator told her that Mitchell was \"indisposed\" and would not be able to talk. In her subsequent report of the conversation, Thomas said that it was apparent someone had taken the phone from Mitchell's hand and the woman could be heard saying \"You just get away.\" Thomas's account was widely covered in the news, and many media outlets made efforts to find Mitchell for an interview. A few days later, Marcia Kramer, a veteran crime reporter of the \"New York Daily News\", tracked Mitchell to the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York. Kramer found \"a beaten woman\" who had \"incredible\" black and blue marks on her arms. In what turned out to be the first of many interviews, Mitchell related how in the week following the Watergate burglary, she had been held captive in that California hotel and that it was King that had pulled the phone cord from the wall. After several attempts to escape from the balcony, she was physically accosted by five men, which had left her needing stitches, and forcefully sedated by a psychiatrist. The incident left her fearing for her life.\nAlthough the Watergate scandal was the leading story across all news formats, her reports were relegated to human-interest stories in major newspapers, including \"The Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Daily News\". Nixon aides, in an effort to discredit Mitchell, told the press that she had a \"drinking problem\", which was not entirely untrue. It was not until February 1975 that McCord, after having been convicted for his role in the Watergate burglary, admitted that Mitchell was, in his words, \"basically kidnapped\", and corroborated her story. He further asserted that H. R. Haldeman, as well as other top aides of President Nixon, had been \"jealous\" of her popularity in the media and had sought out ways to embarrass her.\n\nMitchell began contacting reporters when her husband's role in the scandal became known, initially in an effort to defend him. She was also outspoken about the corruption in the GOP. In May 1976, Mitchell provided sworn testimony in a deposition at the offices of attorney Henry B. Rothblatt in connection with the Democratic party's million civil suit against the CRP. Nixon was later to tell interviewer David Frost in 1977 that Martha was a distraction to John Mitchell, such that no one was minding the store, and \"If it hadn't been for Martha Mitchell, there'd have been no Watergate.\" Because of these allegations, she was discredited and abandoned by most of her family, except for her son Jay. The Mitchells separated in September 1973, with John suddenly moving out of the family home with their daughter, Marty. On January 1, 1975, he was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy for his involvement in the Watergate break-in; he served 19 months in a federal prison. They never saw each other again.\n\nMitchell was Presbyterian and, while in New York, attended Marble Collegiate Church.\n\nAs her health declined, she was called on by a small circle of friends that included her reporter friend, and eventual biographer, Winzola McLendon. McLendon reports that Mitchell was suicidal and without any income. In her final days, she subsisted on donations sent by sympathetic supporters. On May 31, 1976, in the advanced stages of multiple myeloma, Mitchell slipped into a coma and died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City at age 57. Her son, Jay, and her estranged husband and daughter arrived at her funeral shortly after it began. An anonymous supporter had sent a floral arrangement of white chrysanthemums that spelled \"Martha was right.\" She is buried in the Bellwood Cemetery in Pine Bluff.\n\nA November 1970 Gallup poll placed the public's opinion of her at 33-percent unfavorable to 43-percent favorable. \n\nShe refused to curtsy to Queen Elizabeth II at a garden party in July 1971, saying, \"I feel that an American citizen should not bow to foreign monarchs.\" Scotland's Earl of Lindsay, a member of the Queen's Body Guard for Scotland, wrote Mitchell a letter of reprimand, and in a statement to the press said, \"There is always hope she may learn some manners. She is a stupid woman. If she is going to shout her mouth off like that, she is bound to get shouted at.\"\n\nThree years after her death, Washington newswoman and Mitchell-collaborator Winzola McLendon released a book called \"Martha\".\n\nThe birthplace and childhood home of Martha Beall Mitchell, now the Martha Beall Mitchell Home and Museum, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in January 1978. On the second anniversary of her death, Martha Mitchell Expressway in Pine Bluff was named for her. Three years later to the day, a bust was erected in her honor at the Pine Bluff Civic Center with a plaque that reads \"Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\"\n\nMartha Mitchell was portrayed in the 1995 film \"Nixon\" by actress Madeline Kahn who, like Mitchell, died at the age of 57 of cancer.\n\nIn 2004, a three-act play, \"This is Martha Speaking...\", by Thomas Doran premiered in Pine Bluff, Arkansas starring Lee Anne Moore as Martha Mitchell and Michael Childers as John Mitchell. That same year, a one-woman play about Mitchell, \"Dirty Tricks\" by John Jeter, appeared off-Broadway. The first episode of the podcast \"Slow Burn\", entitled \"Martha\", chronicled her role in the Watergate scandal. Mitchell was portrayed by Vanessa Bayer in the July 16, 2019 episode of the Comedy Central show \"Drunk History\".\n\nThe \"Martha Mitchell effect\", in which a psychiatrist mistakenly or willfully identifies a patient's true but extraordinary claims as delusions, was named after her.\n\n\nGaslighting\n\n\n\n"}

The three-storey neo-Georgian building was erected at 80 Beaufort Street, the site of Perth’s original Scotch College.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Andrew Fisher on 8 August 1911. The hall was officially opened on 20 April 1912 by Premier of Western Australia, and former trades hall secretary John Scaddan.\n\nIn 1985 the building was sold and became the Delaney Gallery. The WA Heritage Council has listed it as Heritage Place No. 8783: Delaney Gallery (Trades Hall). A 2010 photograph in the register shows that the name \"Trades Hall\" has been reinstated above the portico.\n\nA new 'Perth Trades Hall', at \"Unity House\", 77-79 Stirling Street, was opened on May Day, 2000. It provided offices and meeting rooms for trade unions, the Australian Labor Party and other community and political groups. The Trades and Labour Council (TLC), now known as UnionsWA, relocated in 2007 to the CSA Building at 445 Hay Street, Perth. WA Labor relocated to new headquarters on 54 Cheriton St, Perth, alongside United Voice.\n\nIn 2013 the building was purchased by the CFMEU West Australian State Registered Union so that the building would once again be used for its intended purpose of Trade Union business. A significant renovation process was undertaken by Union workers restoring the building as far as possible to its original condition, with modern facilities provided for staff .On 29 June 2014 the building was re-opened by Michael O'Connor the National Secretary of the combined CFMEU National Divisions. At the official reopening he unveiled a plaque bearing the inscription \"Back in the Hands of those who built it\". The building now not only houses the CFMEU, but is regularly used by like minded organisations as a meeting venue.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1976413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976413", "title": "Divergent evolution", "text": "Divergent evolution\n\nDivergent evolution or divergent selection is the accumulation of differences between closely related populations within a species, leading to speciation. Divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in allopatric or peripatric speciation) and experience different selective pressures that drive adaptations to their new environment. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become less able to interbreed with one another. The American naturalist J. T. Gulick (1832-1923) was the first to use the term \"divergent evolution\", with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. Classic examples of divergence in nature are the adaptive radiation of the finches of the Galapagos or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with pocket mice and fence lizards.\n\nThe term can also be applied in molecular evolution, such as to proteins that derive from homologous genes. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from gene duplication) can illustrate divergent evolution. Through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. Similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. In contrast, convergent evolution arises when an adaptation has arisen independently, creating analogous structures such as the wings of birds and of insects.\n\nThe term divergent evolution is believed to have been first used by J. T. Gulick. Divergent evolution is commonly defined as what occurs when two groups of the same species evolve different traits within those groups in order to accommodate for differing environmental and social pressures. Various examples of such pressures can include predation, food supplies, and competition for mates. The tympanal ears of certain nocturnal insects are believed to be a result of needing the ultrasonic hearing that tympanal ears provide in order to hear predators in the dark.   Non-nocturnal insects - that do not need to fear nocturnal predators - are often found to lack these tympanal ears.\n\nAnimals undergo divergent evolution for a number of reasons. Predators or their absence, changes in the environment, and the time at which certain animals are most active are chief among them.\n\nA lack of predators – predatory birds and mammals - for cliff-side nest residing kittiwake caused that particular group of kittiwake to lose their ancestral mobbing behavior that had been exhibited up until that point for protecting young. The mobbing behavior normally displayed by the kittiwake is lost when the kittiwake take residence in this area with little threat from predators towards their young. The mobbing behavior was originally developed to protect ground-level nests containing young from various predators such as reptiles, mammals and other birds.\n\nThe cliff-side nesting area itself was similarly responsible for the kittiwakes losing their mobbing mentality – predatory mammals small enough to fit on the cliff edges along with the kittiwakes and their offspring would not be able to make the climb up while predatory birds would not be able to maneuver near the cliff face while also being afflicted by the weather conditions of the area.\n\nDivergent evolution is always coupled with convergent evolution, as they are both similar and different in various facets such as whether something evolves, what evolves, and why it evolves. It is instructive to compare divergent evolution with both convergent and parallel evolution.\n\nConvergent evolution is defined as a similar trait evolution that occurs in two otherwise different species of animal as a result of those two species living in similar environments with similar environmental pressures (like predators and food supply). It differs from divergent evolution in that the species involved are different while the traits they obtain do not differ from each other. An example of convergent evolution is the development of horns in various species for sparring over mates, resources, and territory \n\nParallel evolution is the development of a similar trait in species descending from the same ancestor. It is similar to divergent evolution in that the species descend from the same ancestor, but it differs in that the trait is the same while in divergent evolution the trait is not. An example of parallel evolution is that certain arboreal frog species, 'flying' frogs, in both Old World families and New World families, have developed the ability of gliding flight. They have \"enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs, and reduced weight per snout-vent length\".\n\nOne of the most famous examples of divergent evolution is the case of Darwin's Finches. During Darwin's travels to the Galápagos Islands he discovered several different species of finch that shared a common ancestor. They lived on varying diets and had beaks that differed in shape and size reflecting their diet. The changes in beak shape and size were believed to be required to support their change in diet. Some Galápagos finches have larger and more powerful beaks to crack nuts with. A different type allows the bird to use cactus spines to spear insects in the bark of trees.\n\nAnother good example of divergent evolution is the origin of the domestic dog and the modern wolf. Dogs and wolves both diverged from a common ancestor. The similarity of the mitochondrial DNA sequences from 162 wolves from various parts of the world and 140 dogs of 60 different breeds, revealed by genomic research, further supported the theory that dogs and wolves have diverged from shared ancestry. Dogs and wolves have similar body shape, skull size, and limb formation, further supporting their close genetic makeup and thus shared ancestry. For example, malamutes and huskies are physically and behaviorally similar to wolves. Huskies and malamutes have very similar body size and skull shape. Huskies and wolves share similar coat patterns as well as tolerance to cold. In the hypothetical situations, mutations and breeding events were simulated to show the progression of the wolf behavior over ten generations. The results concluded that even though the last generation of the wolves were more docile and less aggressive, the temperament of the wolves fluctuated greatly from one generation to the next.\n\n"}

More formally, if \"V\" is a vector space of dimension \"d\", the problem is to determine, given a finite subset of vectors \"S\" and a convex subset \"A\", the number of subsets of \"S\" whose summation is in \"A\".\n\nThe first upper bound for this problem was proven (for \"d\" = 1 and \"d\" = 2) in 1938 by John Edensor Littlewood and A. Cyril Offord. This Littlewood–Offord lemma states that if \"S\" is a set of \"n\" real or complex numbers of absolute value at least one and \"A\" is any disc of radius one, then not more than formula_1 of the 2 possible subsums of \"S\" fall into the disc.\n\nIn 1945 Paul Erdős improved the upper bound for \"d\" = 1 to\nusing Sperner's theorem. This bound is sharp; equality is attained when all vectors in \"S\" are equal. In 1966, Kleitman showed that the same bound held for complex numbers. In 1970, he extended this to the setting when \"V\" is a normed space.\n\nSuppose \"S\" = {\"v\", …, \"v\"}. By subtracting\nfrom each possible subsum (that is, by changing the origin and then scaling by a factor of 2), the Littlewood–Offord problem is equivalent to the problem of determining the number of sums of the form\nthat fall in the target set \"A\", where formula_5 takes the value 1 or −1. This makes the problem into a probabilistic one, in which the question is of the distribution of these \"random vectors\", and what can be said knowing nothing more about the \"v\".\n"}
{"id": "1976426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976426", "title": "Otello (Rossini)", "text": "Otello (Rossini)\n\nOtello () is an opera in three acts by Gioachino Rossini to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Berio di Salsa. The work, which premiered in December 1816, is based on a French adaptation of the story (\"Othello, ou le More de Venise\" by Jean-François Ducis, 1792), not Shakespeare's play \"Othello\" as neither Rossini nor his librettist knew the English drama.\n\nThe plot of the libretto differs greatly from Shakespeare's play in that it takes place wholly in Venice, not mainly on Cyprus, and the dramatic conflict develops in a different manner. The role of Iago is much less diabolical than Shakespeare's play or Verdi's 1887 opera \"Otello\", which was based on it. Shakespeare derived his play from the story \"Un Capitano Moro\" (\"A Moorish Captain\") by Cinthio, a disciple of Boccaccio, first published in 1565.In further contrast, the role of Roderigo, a sub-plot in Shakespeare and Verdi, is very prominent in Rossini's version—some of the most difficult and brilliant music being assigned to the character Rodrigo. The roles of Otello, Iago, and Rodrigo are all composed for the tenor voice.\n\nRossini's \"Otello\" is an important milestone in the development of opera as musical drama. It provided Giuseppe Verdi with a benchmark for his own adaptations of Shakespeare. A 1999 Opera Rara CD of the opera includes an alternative happy ending, a common practice with drama and opera at that period of the 19th century.\n\n19th century\n\nThe first performance took place at the Teatro del Fondo in Naples on 4 December 1816. It was first performed in Paris on 5 June 1821 at the Théâtre Italien (with Manuel Garcia as Otello and Giuditta Pasta as Desdemona), in London on 16 May 1822 at the King's Theatre, and in New York on 7 February 1826 at the Park Theatre.\n\nCuriously, though the role of Iago is indicated in the early scores as that of a tenor and was taken up in the early years by tenors Ciccimarra, Luigi Campitelli, Domenico Reina, only three years after the premiere, Rossini adapted the role for the baritone voice and it was frequently sung thereafter by baritones, including the most renowned bel canto-era \"secondo basso cantante\", transitional baritones, and practicing Verdian baritones of the 19th century.\n\nDuring this period Iago was assigned to the Italian sometimes-second-tenor, sometimes-baritone Giovanola at the Théâtre Italien in Paris on 26 July 1823 with Giuditta Pasta as Desdemona. The Spanish baritone (later pedagogue) Manuel García, Jr. sang the role on his family's trip to the New York in 1826. The Italian baritone Ferdinando Lauretti sang it at Verona in 1827 and a review of this performance was dispatched to London's \"The Harmonicon\", which mentions his \"character of Iago, a part for a bass which was greatly improved by Rossini, during his engagement at your Italian opera.\" Domenico Cosselli sang the role at Turin's Teatro d'Angennes in 1828, as did the Italian \"primo basso\" Federico Crespi (1833), Antonio Tamburini (from 1834), Luciano Fornasari (in 1844), Giovanni Belletti (in 1849), Joseph Tagliafico in 1850, Giorgio Ronconi (from 1851), Francesco Graziani (from 1869), and Antonio Cotogni (in 1869). French baritone Paul Barroilhet appeared in 1844 in Paris, where he interpolated the aria \"\" (transposed from C to B-flat) from Rossini's \"La donna del lago\". His successor, Jean-Baptiste Faure, sang the role in 1871.\n\nA French printed edition from 1823 already shows Iago's part written in the bass clef.\n\n20th century and beyond\n\nAfter a long period of relative neglect, in the late 20th century the opera began once more to appear on the world's stages. A production by Pier Luigi Pizzi was given at the Pesaro Festival in 1988. The same production was performed at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 2000 with Bruce Ford, Mariella Devia and Juan Diego Flórez in leading roles.\n\nIn October 2012, Opera Southwest in Albuquerque, New Mexico presented three performances of the opera. The first gave both the original and the alternative \"happy\" ending. Prior to the second performances, the audience voted for the ending they preferred, and the chosen version was then performed. Also in 2012, the opera was staged in Zurich by the Vlaamse Opera. The same production was given in Ghent and Antwerp in February and March 2014.\n\nBuxton Festival presented the opera in concert form in July 2014.\n\n\"Otello\" was performed in a production at the Theater an der Wien and the Oper Frankfurt in 2019, with Enea Scala in the title role, cast by Damiano Michieletto as a successful Muslim Arab in today's Venetian business world, with Karolina Makuła and Nino Machaidze as Desdemona.\n\nAccording to the booklet of the Milanese representations of 1818:\n\n\"Otello, African to the service of Adria (Venice), victor returns from a battle against the Turks. A secret wedding ties him to Desdemona, daughter of his enemy, Elmiro Patrizio Veneto, already promised to Rodrigo, son of the Doge. Jago, another frustrated lover of Desdemona and hidden enemy of Otello, in order to be revenged of perceived wrongs, pretends to favor the love-suit of Rodrigo; an intercepted letter of the latter, by means of which Otello is led to believe his wife unfaithful, forms the texture of the action, which ends with the death of Desdemona, pierced by Otello, leading him to go mad, after uncovering the deceit of Jago and the innocence of his wife.”\n\nAs in Verdi's \"Otello\", Desdemona's aria \"\"Salce\"\" (\"Willow Song\") is a pivotal moment in the final act.\n\nFranz Liszt based the Canzone from the Années de Pèlerinage supplement Venezia e Napoli on the offstage gondolier's song \"Nessun maggior dolore\" from this opera.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Most of his ten-year career was spent with the San Francisco Giants. He played for the Giants in the 1989 World Series against the Oakland Athletics.\n\nBorn in San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, Uribe was signed by the New York Yankees in , but was released shortly afterwards without even having played a minor league game with the club. He eventually signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in , and after four seasons in their farm system, received a September call-up in . In eight games with the Cards, Uribe batted .211 with three runs batted in and four runs scored.\n\nIn February , Uribe, David Green, Dave LaPoint and Gary Rajsich were dealt to the San Francisco Giants for Jack Clark. Between the time of the initial trade and his delivery, he changed his name from José González Uribe (Uribe is his mother's maiden name; González is his father's name. (See Spanish naming customs) to just José Uribe because, as he put it, \"There are too many Gonzálezes in baseball!\" Thus, he was humorously referred to as \"the player to be named later\" and sometimes \"the ultimate player to be named later\", a quote attributed to coach Rocky Bridges.\n\nUribe was the Giants' principal shortstop for eight seasons, including their National League Western Division championship and National League pennant, leading the league with 85 double plays in the latter season. In the 1987 National League Championship Series he had a two-run single with the bases loaded in the second inning of Game 5, giving the Giants a 4–3 lead. He then stole third base and scored as the Giants won 6–3 for a 3–2 series lead, though San Francisco went on to lose the final two games. He won the 1988 Willie Mac Award honoring his spirit and leadership.\n\nUribe was also a fan favorite at Candlestick Park, where the home crowd had a unique chant for the relatively light-hitting infielder. When he would come to bat, fans on one side of the stadium would shout \"OOH!\" after which fans on the other side would respond with \"REE-bay!\". Giants fans would later use the same chant for Juan Uribe, José's second cousin. He also received the uncommon nickname José \"Game Winning\" Uribe from ESPN announcer Chris Berman when the stat known as the \"Game Winning RBI\" was an official statistic.\n\nAfter an injury-plagued season, Uribe lost his starting job to Royce Clayton in .

Beckett has stated that there is nothing rare or uncommon about the card, and its exorbitant asking price in some auctions has no definable merit.\n\nHis first wife, Sarah, died at the age of 27 of a heart attack, two days after giving birth to their third child.\n\nUribe was killed, at age 47, December 8, 2006, in a car crash at about 3:00 a.m. near his hometown of Juan Baron, Palenque, Dominican Republic.

She was the daughter of Charles Ferguson Henry, an accountant and his wife Margaret (\"née\" Walker), a garment worker. She had one brother, Alfred, who was born in 1859. Both of her parents were Scottish and moved to Australia in 1853. She attended several schools in Melbourne, eventually matriculating with credit from Richard Hale Budd's Educational Institute for Ladies in 1874.\n\nAfter completing high school, Henry taught briefly and eventually became a featured reporter for \"The Melbourne Argus\" and the \"Australian\". Her journalism mainly focused on progressive causes such as labour reform, disabled children and proportional representation. She also became involved with Australian politics in the 1890s, and began to lecture on topics such as women's rights, suffrage and labour. She became closely associated with the progressive movement in Melbourne. Henry moved to the United States from Australia in 1906 and became office secretary of the Women's Trade Union League in Chicago. While working for the Women's Trade Union League she became prominent in the fight for women's suffrage, union organisation and labour rights. She served a variety of jobs within the union including field organiser and director of the education department.\n\nHenry remained involved in writing during her time in America. She edited the women's section of the Chicago \"Union Labor Advocate\" and was the founding editor of the Women's Trade Union League's \"Life and Labor\" periodical until 1915. Henry also wrote two books, \"The Trade Union Woman\" (1915) and \"Women in the Labor Movement\" (1923). Both of these books focus on the particular struggles and inequalities working-class women faced during this time period.\n\nThe Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) was established in 1903 and consisted of reformers seeking to combine trade unionism and feminism to create a new force towards the obstacles women faced when organising women into unions. In Henry's 1915 essay \"A Separate Piece\" published in \"The Trade Union Woman\" she discussed some of the problems associated with organising. One of the issues she addressed was the tension between middle-class reformers of the WTUL and the working-class women. A possible solution that she advocated was the establishment of separate women's locals.\n\nHenry's background with Fabian socialism, as well as her knowledge of Australian labour legislation and woman suffrage attracted the attention of Margaret Dreier Robins, a prominent reformer of the time. Henry was invited by Robins to work for the National Women's Trade Union League of America in Chicago as a lecturer and field-worker. As a field worker Henry organised new branches, and as a journalist she became a key figure and voice in the campaign for 'woman suffrage, union organisation, vocational education, and labour legislation.'\n\nBetween 1907 and 1925 Henry served as an editor, publicist and lecturer for the WTUL. Henry played an active role in mobilising both the middle class as well as trade union support for the League's legislative, educational and organizational goals. As an activist she participated in many clubs such as the Melbourne Shakespeare Society, was secretary of the Women Writer's Club, lectured and frequently at women's organisations (like the Prahran and Kew Progressive League). Alice also served as an advisory member on committees set up by the National Council of Women and the Victorian Women's Federation. It is important to note that she was not a leader or organiser of the women's movement rather she worked as a prominent publicist within it. \"Life and Labor\" was the journal of the National Women Trade Union League. It was published in Chicago and effectively promoted women's suffrage.\n\nOn 19 May 1911 a suffrage meeting was held at The Pfister Hotel club room, there Henry urged that the best ways to obtain result was to carry out a campaign along intensive lines. There she advocated for street meetings to create interest in the suffrage cause. Henry said,\n\nHenry had the ability to captivate American audiences when she spoke due to her conviction and energy she exuded.\nHenry saw current legislation and policy as not helping.\n\nThrough her own personal experience in Australia she said that women's suffrage there had resulted in a more positive shift in attitudes toward women in the industry. She cited that wages and factory conditions have improved and that in general industries had become more humanised. Henry did admit that the women had not been the only factor in these changes but that the increased power in women had a materially role in aiding these changes.\n\nHenry retired to Santa Barbara, California in 1928 after completing a lecture and investigation tour in Britain. After suffering financially during the Great Depression, Henry returned to Australia in 1933. She continued her work later in life, and compiled a bibliography of Australian woman writers in 1937. Henry died on 14 February 1943 in a hospital in Melbourne.\n\nThroughout her life Henry was passionate about feminism and the equal rights of women. Her passion for the emancipation and equality of women is her main legacy, as she devoted much of her life and writing towards that cause. Her two books \"The Trade Union Woman\" and \"Women in the Labor Movement\" offer insight into the lives of working-class women involved in progressive movements in the early twentieth century.\n\n\n"}

His birth and death dates are unknown; his first publication dates from 1575, his last from 1588.\n\nIn 1549, he entered a Benedictine monastery, and the title pages of his published works indicate that he was a monk in the abbey of Monte Cassino at the time of their printing. According to the dedication of Falconio's \"Psalmodia vespertina\" (Vespers psalms), the composer was part of a group or consortium that helped introduce Venetian music printing methods into his native Brescia.\n\nFalconio's works are all of the sacred vocal category, and include introits, alleluias, magnificats, psalm settings, and works relating to the Passion. He seems to have taken pains in many cases to make his works readily performable even for less-trained forces in smaller parishes. This is illustrated in that, despite the prevailing atmosphere of polychoral works, or at least works for five or more voices, Falconio wrote often for but four voices, and even for three on one occasion, a \"Voces Christi\". Contributing also to this accessibility is the simple, homophonic nature shared by many of his works, though of course such an idiom had begun to dominate in the post-Tridentine era of the 1570s and 80s. Perhaps more telling, then, of Falconio's practicality is that, when he did compose in a more contrapuntal fashion, in his collection \"Introitus et Alleluia per omnes festivitates totius anni\", he included an explicit part for organ accompaniment in the publication. While Falconio almost surely did not invent the technique, and this work of 1575 is very probably pre-dated by the presence of other such organ parts in manuscript, it contains the first known published example of \"basso seguente.\" This technique, in which a line for organ simply provides the lowest note being sounded in the vocal parts at any given time, is the precursor of the basso continuo (for further explanation of this, see Figured bass).\n\n"}

Chan stars in films as well as Hong Kong/Singaporean/mainland-Chinese television serials although she is most well known for many of her roles in the TVB series, especially \"Song Bird\". She has also performed alongside Jacky Cheung in the musical \"Snow.Wolf.Lake\", the Mandarin and Cantonese version.\n\nIn 1995, Chan changed her name from 陳松龄 to 陳松伶. The pronunciation was still the same – Ling – but a different character was used. The 'Ling' in her original name means \"age\" and the 'Ling' in her new name is part of a phrase that means \"intelligent and witty\". As her short hair grew longer, Chan went through yet another metamorphosis in 1999. She officially changed her English name from Nadia to Nnadia. The added \"n\" was a self reminder to \"never give up.\" It also symbolized \"new\". In 2012, she again changed her English stage name to Adia, removing the 2 initial \"n's\". A reason for the change has not been given publicly.\n\nChan is now settled in Beijing after marriage to Chinese actor Zhang Duo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Denial of any of them reduces individuals to things, inviting many problems. The industrial age is assumed to have been a period dependent on such denial. Covey believed the information age and a foreseen \"Age of Wisdom\" require \"whole\" people (in whole jobs).\n\nSome versions of the book come with a DVD, although all the short films on this DVD can be viewed via Covey's website. The book is divided into two sections, with the first few chapters focusing on finding your voice, while the later chapters are about inspiring others to find their voice. Most of the chapters in the book include a section discussing one of the 'stories' from the DVD, which are intended to illustrate the theme of the chapter (for example the story of Helen Keller and another about the Berlin Wall).\n\nThe book talks of \"5 Cancerous Behaviors\" (page 135) that inhibit people's greatness:\n\nPeople can discover their voice because of the three gifts everyone is born with:\n\n\nCovey talks about great achievers expressing their voice through the use of their intelligences.

His father, Kunga Gyaltsen (1432–1481) (), was a ngakpa (married tantric practitioner) of the Nyingma lineage, a famous Nyingma tantric master. His mother was Machik Kunga Pemo, they were a farming family. According to scholar Gene Smith, \"the rebirth of the First Dalai Lama as the son of Grub chen Kun dga' rgyal mtshan resulted in the end of a hereditary line of Shangs pa Bka' brgyud pa lamas.\"\n\nLegend has it that soon after he learned to speak, he told his parents his name was Pema Dorje, the birth name of Gendun Drup (1391–1474) and that his father was Lobsang Drakpa, which was Tsongkapa's ordination name. When he was four, he reportedly told his parents he wished to live in the Tashilhunpo monastery (next to Shigatse and founded in 1447 by Gendun Drup) to be with his monks.\n\nHe was proclaimed the reincarnation of Gendun Drup as a young boy – according to some sources at the age of four years, and to others at eight.\n\nHe received his novice vows from Panchen Lungrig Gyatso in 1486, at the age of ten, and his vows of an ordained monk from Ghoje Choekyi Gyaltsen who gave him his ordination name of Gedun Gyatso. At the age of eleven, he was enthroned as the reincarnation of Gendun Drubpa at Tashilhunpo monastery. He received his novice and then full ordination vows.\n\nHe remained at Tashilhunpo until he was 16 or 17 but, then, due to \"some controversies or jealousy\" he had to leave the monastery and went to Lhasa to study at Drepung Monastery.\n\nWhen the high priests came looking for the incarnation of Gendun Drup, they found him when he was 17 years old. Apparently, he told the priests that he had been waiting for them.\nHe was a renowned scholar and composer of mystical poetry, who traveled widely to extend Gelugpa influence, and became abbot of the largest Gelugpa monastery, Drepung, which from this time on was closely associated with the reincarnation line which eventually would be known as that of the Dalai Lamas. According to Sumpa Khenpo, the great Gelug scholar, he also studied some Nyingma-pa tantric doctrines.\n\nIt is said that Palden Lhamo, the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake, Lhamo La-tso, promised the First Dalai Lama in one of his visions \"that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas.\" Since the time of Gendun Gyatso, who formalised the system, monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there. Gendun Gyatso is said to have been the first to discover the sacredness of Lake Lhamoi Latso.\n\nIn 1509 he went to southern Tibet and founded the monastery of Chokorgyel Monastery (Chokhor-gyal) close to lake Lhamo La-tso, about 115 km northeast of Tsetang and at an altitude of 4,500 m (14,764 ft), while the lake itself is at an altitude of about 5,000 m. (16,404 ft).\n\nGedun Gyatso became abbot of Tashilhunpo in 1512 at the age of thirty-six. In 1517 he became abbot of Drepung monastery and he revived the 'Great Prayer Festival' or Monlam Chenmo in 1518, presiding over the celebration with monks from the three large Gelug monasteries of Sera, Drepung and Gaden (Ganden was the original monastery of the Geluk order, founded by Je Tsongkhapa himself in 1409). He then became abbot of Sera monastery in 1525; Sera had been founded in 1419, by Jamchen Chojey (Sakya Yeshe), a disciple of Tsong Khapa.\n\nHis Seat has been Drepung.\n\nGedun Gyatso died deep in meditation at the age of 67 in 1542.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Riki Takeuchi as the gang boss and former yakuza Ryūichi and Show Aikawa as the Japanese cop Detective Jojima and focuses on their meeting and conflict. It is the first in a loosely-connected three-part series, followed by \"\" in 2000 and \"\" in 2002.\n\nRyūichi (Riki Takeuchi) is the leader of a small gang of nikkei gangsters operating in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo, made up of his childhood friends, Satake (Hitoshi Ozawa), Mariko (Mizuho Koga), Hoshiyama (Ryuushi Muzkami) and Hitoshi (Kyousuke Yabe). They pull off a daring, broad daylight robbery of a truck carrying money out of a business run by Aoki (Renji Ishibashi), a local yakuza boss who is in the middle of negotiating a territory deal with a triad gang led by Mr. Chen (Shingo Tsurumi). Humiliated by the public loss of money at the hands of petty crooks, Aoki turns to Detective Jojima (Show Aikawa) of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, instructing him to find the culprits of the robbery and turn them over to him. Jojima is heavily in debt to Aoki, since he and his wife (Kaoru Sugita) borrowed money to pay for a surgery that his daughter required to save her life.\n\nRyūichi and his cohorts pick up his younger brother, Toji (Michisuke Kashiwaya), from the airport. Toji had been studying in the United States and has temporarily returned home while on Spring Break. The gang parties to celebrate Toji's return but the mood is soured when Toji learns that Ryūichi has been paying for his studies by committing robberies for the yakuza. The mood is further soured when Ryūichi discovers that gang member Hitoshi has betrayed them and stolen a large part of the money from the heist. The gang tracks down Hitoshi to his mother's house and, despite Toji's pleas, Hitoshi is executed. After the murder, Toji doesn't want to see Ryūichi ever again.\n\nDetective Jojima and his partner, Detective Inoue (Susumu Terajima), start investigating the robbery and discover leads that point to Ryūichi and his crew. They travel to Ryūichi's home town and find information on each of the gang's members. They also discover about Hitoshi's death. They bring Ryūichi in for questioning and try to talk him into confessing and going to prison, since he'll otherwise have to go up against the yakuza. Despite the threat, Ryūichi refuses to confess. In turn, Jojima tells Aoki that Ryūichi was behind the robbery.\n\nIn order to find out what Aoki is planning, Mariko spies on him while he visits the brothel where she works as her day job. Unfortunately for her, Aoki realizes who she is, drugs her, rapes her and kills her. In retaliation, Ryūichi turns to the leader of one of Aoki's rival yakuza clans and offers to assassinate him in exchange for the guns to do so.\n\nDuring a celebration of the new partnership between Aoki's yakuza and Chen's triad, Ryūichi, Satake and Hoshiyama make their move and attack all those gathered. Ryūichi is almost killed by Chen, but he is saved by Toji, who'd followed him to try to stop him from going forward with the hit. Detective Inoue arrives during the massacre, since he'd gotten a tip from an informant, and tries to arrest the nikkei gang. Inoue is shot and killed by Ryūichi, but not before he accidentally kills Toji. Distraught over his brother's death, Ryūichi flees in anguish, not realizing that Aoki has survived. Detective Jojima is the first officer on the scene after the battle is over, where he finds a dead Inoue and a cowering but still alive Aoki. After Aoki brags about how much money he'll make now that he doesn't have to share territory with the triads, Jojima kills him in disgust.\n\nJojima delivers the bad news to Inoue's wife and child, who decide to leave Tokyo in fear of further violence. Jojima decides to send his own wife and daughter away as well, giving them his car so they can go stay with his mother in the countryside. Unfortunately, Ryūichi had set up a bomb in that car to try to kill Jojima and it accidentally winds up killing his family instead.\n\nAfter burying his wife and daughter, Jojima tracks down what remains of the nikkei gang as they prepare to leave the country for Taiwan. He runs their car off the road as they head towards the Tokyo docks and attacks them. Hoshiyama blows himself up with a grenade while trying to kill Jojima, but the detective survives and guns down Satake. Ryūichi and Jojima have a final stand-off where they both shoot each other repeatedly in the chest, but inexplicably neither one dies. Jojima draws a rocket launcher and Ryūichi produces a fireball from his hands and both attack each other with their new, supernatural weapons. The resulting explosion destroys the entirety of Japan.\n\n\n\"Dead or Alive\" was shown at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1999. The film received a theatrical release in Japan on November 27, 1999.\n\nA review in \"Sight & Sound\" found that the film \"demonstrates enough flair and grotesque wit to make for very enjoyable viewing.\" with an ending that \"demolishes any vestiges of genre credibility.\"\n\nThe \"Dead or Alive\" films are not connected in any apparent way except by director Takashi Miike and stars Riki Takeuchi and Show Aikawa. In the first film, they play yakuza and cop, respectively. \"Dead or Alive\" is notable for Takashi Miike's characteristic scenes of ultra-violence and perversity, which come casually littered throughout.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1976579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976579", "title": "5th Dalai Lama", "text": "5th Dalai Lama\n\nNgawang Lobsang Gyatso (; ; 1617–1682) was the 5th Dalai Lama and the first Dalai Lama to wield effective temporal and spiritual power over all Tibet. He is often referred to simply as the Great Fifth, being a key religious and temporal leader of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibet. Gyatso is credited with unifying all Tibet after a Mongol military intervention which ended a protracted era of civil wars. As an independent head of state, he established diplomatic relations with China and other regional countries and also met early European explorers. Gyatso also wrote 24 volumes' worth of scholarly and religious works on a wide range of subjects.\n\nTo understand the context within which the Dalai Lama institution came to hold temporal power in Tibet during the lifetime of the 5th, it may be helpful to review not just the early life of Lobsang Gyatso but also the world into which he was born, as Künga Migyur.\n\nThe child who would become the 5th Dalai Lama was born in the Chonggye Valley in Ü, south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and about two days' journey south-east of Lhasa, to a prominent family of nobles with traditional ties to both Nyingma and Kagyu lineages. The aristocratic Zahor family into which he was born had held their seat since the 14th century at Taktsé Castle, south of Lhasa –  a legendary stronghold of Tibetan kings in the days of the early empire, before Songtsen Gampo (604–650 CE) had moved his capital from there to Lhasa.\n\nThe 5th Dalai Lama's father was called Dudul Rabten, the local ruler of the Chonggye valley, also known as Hor Dudül Dorjé; his mother was called Tricham, Kunga Lhadze or Kunga Lhanzi. His father had friendly relations with the Drugpa Kagyu and his mother had connections with the Jonangpa Kagyu through her family at Nakartse Dzong. Thus, after his birth on the 22nd day of the 9th month of the Fire-snake year (late 1617), Taranatha, the most remarkable scholar and exponent of the Jonang school (a.k.a. Tagten Tulku, a.k.a. Kunga Nyingpo), named the child 'Kün-ga Migyur Tobgyal Wanggi Gyalpo'. His family called him 'Künga Migyur'.\n\nThe child's father, Dudul Rabten, was arrested in 1618 for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, leader of the Tsang hegemony. Karma Phuntsok's grandfather Zhingshak Tseten Dorje (also known as Karma Tseten) had originally been appointed Governor of Tsang by the Rinpung Prime Minister Ngawang Namgyel in 1548. Tseten Dorje had rebelled against the heirs of Ngawang Namgyel starting in 1557, eventually overthrowing the Rinpung and establishing the Tsang hegemony in 1565 by declaring himself King of Tsang. Tseten Dorje established his residence at Samdruptse castle, also called Shigatse, near the Gelug monastery of Tashilhunpo, and together with his nine sons, eventually extended the reach of his power over both of Tibet's central provinces of Ü and Tsang.\n\nThe secular government of King Tseten Dorje and his descendants enjoyed general support from the Sakya, Jonang, and Kagyu schools, while maintaining somewhat tense but cordial relations with his Gelug neighbours at Tashilhunpo. Then Altan Khan, King of the Tumed Mongols, invited Drepung Monastery's abbot Sonam Gyatso to Mongolia. In 1577–78 Sonam Gyatso accepted, went there and converted him and his subjects to Buddhism, receiving the Mongolian name \"Dalai\" in the process by which action his lineage became known as the \"Dalai Lamas\" and he became the 3rd Dalai Lama. His two predecessors became known as the 1st and 2nd Dalai Lamas posthumously. The Samdruptse government saw this development as a politico-religious alliance between the Gelugpa and a foreign power. When Sonam Gyatso died, the Gelugpa recognised a Mongolian prince as his incarnation and so a Mongolian 4th Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso (1589–1617), was installed as the abbot of Drepung. This increased Mongolian involvement with the Gelugpa even further and enabled more Mongolian intervention in Tibetan affairs. As a result, King Tseten Dorje's suspicions about Gelugpa ambitions rose and when in 1616 the 4th Dalai Lama died young, at the age of 28, in an attempt to defeat the process the King prohibited the Gelugpa monks from searching for his incarnation.\n\nDudul Rabten's arrest occurred at roughly the same time that his infant son had been recognized, in secret, by lamas of the Gelug order as the reincarnation of the 4th Dalai Lama, while Tashilhunpo's abbot Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen used diplomacy to persuade King Karma Phuntsok Namgyal to lift the ban he'd put in place on seeking out the 5th Dalai Lama. Dudul Rabten escaped his captors and tried to reach eastern Tibet, but was rearrested. Dudul Rabten died in captivity in 1626 at Samdruptse – Karma Phuntsok Namgyal's castle also known as Shigatse – and thus, he never lived to see his son again. The young 5th Dalai Lama's family were ordered by Karma Phuntsok Namgyal to live at court in Samdruptse, but his mother, Kunga Lhanzi, fearing retribution from the king, returned with her son to her family's home, Narkatse castle, in Yardrog.\n\nThe infant Künga Migyur's name had been drawn, by lot, from among the names of three children considered likely candidates in a series of divination rituals including a doughball divination which was held in secret (on account of King Dorje's prohibition against seeking the 4th Dalai Lama's reincarnation) at Radeng monastery. The former 4th Dalai Lama's chief attendant, Sonam Choephel (1595–1658), is credited with having discovered the incarnation.\n\nWhile the Karma, Drugpa and Jonangpa Kagyu orders, (beside the Gelug group from Drepung monastery) had all independently sought to claim Künga Migyur as a reincarnation of one or another of their own lamas who'd also died in 1616, young Künga Migyur's parents reportedly resisted their demands.\n\nLobsang Gyatso was the name which Künga Migyur received from Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen upon taking novice monastic ordination from him at Drepung. In 1638 when he took full ordination, also in the presence of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, Ngawang was added to his name, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso. At this time his interest in the Nyingmapa teachings began to deepen and his devotion to the Nyingma master Zur Choying Rangdrol became somewhat conspicuous.\n\nLobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (1570–1662), the Panchen Lama and the first to be accorded this title during his lifetime, was the tutor and a close ally of the 5th Dalai Lama, who, according to Thubten Jigme Norbu and Hugh E. Richardson, declared or pronounced the Panchen to be 'an incarnation of Dhayani Buddha Amitābha' – although other sources all appear to indicate that he was considered as such from the start.\nAfter the 5th Dalai Lama returned from China, on a teaching tour of Tsang he visited his senior tutor and close friend the elderly Panchen Lama at Tashilhunpo to receive lineage transmissions which he still lacked and at this point he requested the Panchen to accept Tashilhunpo Monastery, built by the 1st Dalai Lama, as his multi-lifetime seat for future incarnations.\nSince then, every incarnation of the Panchen Lama has been the master of Tashilhunpo Monastery and it is there that they have all received their education and their mummified bodies were enshrined.\n\nWhen Panchen Gyaltsen died in 1662 at 93, the 5th Dalai Lama immediately commenced the tradition of searching for his next incarnation. He composed a special prayer asking his master \"to return\" and directed the monks of Tibet's great monasteries to recite it. He also reserved the traditional title of \"Panchen\" (short for \"Pandita chen po\" \"Great Scholar\") – which had previously been a courtesy title for all exceptionally learned lamas – exclusively for the Panchen Lama and his successors (and, for those who consider him the 4th Panchen, for his three predecessors as well). He had also predicted that Gyaltsen would continue to be reincarnated in future as the 'Panchen Lama'.\n\nThe two had a teacher/disciple relationship going back to the 1st Dalai Lama Gendun Drup and his teacher Khedrup Je, considered by some in retrospect as the 1st Panchen Lama. From the time of the 5th the two offices were known as \"Yab Sey Gonpo\" or \"Father/Son Protectors\" characterising their spiritual provenance as emanations of Amitābha and Avalokitesvara as well as their interchangeable guru/disciple relationship. This continued, lifetime after lifetime well into the 20th century with whichever was elder becoming the teacher of the younger, giving both monastic ordination and passing on tantric lineage transmissions.\n\nAlthough the 5th Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso, completed all his formal monastic training as a Gelugpa, proving to be an exceptional scholar, he also studied Nyingmapa doctrines, and took Nyingma tantric empowerments. The great Geluk scholar Sumpa Khenpo acknowledged that Lobsang Gyatso took a special interest in Nyingma tantric doctrines. In fact, the Fifth Dalai Lama states in his autobiography that rather than the Panchen Lama or any other Geluk masters, the great Nyingma lama Zur Choying Rangdrol ‘the omniscient’ (kun mkhyen zur chos dbyings rang grol, 1604–1657) was his 'root guru', 'spiritual master' and his 'root master'.\n\nFifth Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso's rule over central Tibet may be characterized, in very broad terms,\n\nAlthough the Fifth Dalai Lama would ultimately come to be known for unifying Tibet, it was his first regent Sonam Choephel (1595-1657 CE, also known as Sonam Rabten, treasurer of Ganden) who was, in fact, \"the prime architect of the Gelug's rise to power\". The 5th Dalai Lama would eventually assume complete power – including that of appointing his regents.\n\nSonam Choephel, the regent during the 5th Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso's youth, requested the aid of Güshi Khan, a powerful Dzungar military leader in carrying out a military strategy in the Dalai Lama's name, though apparently with neither Lobsang Gyatso's prior knowledge nor consent.\n\nGüshi Khan (who was head of the Khoshut tribe) conquered Kham in 1640 bringing the Sakyas and the lords of Kham and Amdo under their control. His victory over Karma Tenkyong, the prince of Tsang in Shigatse, in 1642, completed the military conquest of the country and the establishment of the Khoshut Khanate. By this feat the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was associated with a variant of the Kagyu school, was technically replaced; in actual fact it had been powerless for many years. By subsequently formally recognizing the Fifth Dalai Lama's authority in 1642, Güshi Khan effectively made Gyatso the temporal ruler of all Tibet.\n\nGüshi Khan maintained friendly and respectful relations with Lobsang Gyatso, but died in 1655, leaving ten sons. Eight of them (along with their tribes) settled in the strategically important Koko Nur region of Amdo, where they frequently fought over territory. The 5th Dalai Lama sent several governors to the region between 1656 and 1659 to restore order. Although Güshi Khan's descendants (who would come to be known as the Upper Mongols) showed little interest in the administration of Tibet, they did appoint a regent for a while to act on their behalf in Lhasa, and gradually assimilated certain aspects of Tibetan culture into their own. They would also come to play a crucial rôle in extending the influence of the Gelug school within Amdo.\n\nThe 5th Dalai Lama tutored Galdan Boshugtu Khan who later became leader of the Dzungar Khanate and granted him the titles of Hongtaiji and Boshoghtu (or Boshughtu) Khan. The Dalai Lama also sanctioned Galdan Boshugtu Khan's invasion of the last remaining remnants of the Chagatai Khanate in the Dzungar conquest of Altishahr after Afaq Khoja requested help from the Dalai Lama over the power struggle between the Afaqi and Ishaqi Khojas.\n\nIn a move distinctly evocative of Songtsen Gampo, Lobsang Gyatso once again proclaimed Lhasa to be the capital of Tibet. Assembling his government there, he \"appointed governors to the districts, chose ministers for his government, and promulgated a set of laws\". The young Dalai Lama also transformed his regent into a prime minister – or, as the Tibetans call him, the \"Desi\". Administrative authority was vested in the person of the \"Desi\", while military power remained the special domain of Güshi Khan, whom the 5th Dalai Lama acknowledged as king of the Dzungar Upper Mongols in Kokonor.\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama began construction of the Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisors, Konchog Chophel (d. 1646), pointed out that the site would be an ideal seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries, and overlooking Songtsen Gampo's old capital city of Lhasa. The 5th Dalai Lama and his government moved into the \"Potrang Karpo\" – the White Palace – in 1649.\n\nThe initial phase of construction continued until 1694, some twelve years after the 5th Dalai Lama's death, which was kept secret from the general public for that length of time. The \"Potrang Marpo\" – or Red Palace – was added between 1690 and 1694.\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama formally institutionalized the Tibetan state oracle of Nechung. Lobsang Gyatso established Nechung Monastery as the seat of Tibet's state oracle by instituting Gyalpo Pehar as the protector of Tibet's newly consolidated Ganden Phodrang government. \"Nechung\" – which, translated literally, means \"small place\" – was a shrine dedicated to Pehar, located about ten minutes east on foot from Drepung monastery near Tibet's newly declared capital city of Lhasa.\n\nThe rôle of the three-headed, six-armed Pehar as protector of Tibet can be traced back to at least the 8th century, when Pehar was oath-bound by Padmasambhava to act as chief among Tibet's protector's, with Dorje Drakden named his chief emissary. The 5th Dalai Lama also composed a generation stage practice and invocation of the protector entitled simply \"Dra-Yang-Ma\" (Melodic Chant), which was incorporated into the ritual cycles of Nechung Monastery, where it continues to be practiced, up to the present day.\nNechung's rôle in warding off one interfering spirit in particular is quite extensively detailed in the 5th Dalai Lama's autobiography. Some contemporary scholars and the current 14th Dalai Lama would appear to agree: Lobsang Gyatso specifically states that a gyalpo (: a particular type of \"very powerful, perfidious spirit\") in the area of \"Dol Chumig Karmo\" had \"...been harming the teaching of the Buddha and sentient beings in general and in particular\" since at least the fire-bird year of 1657 (CE). The version of events which the 5th Dalai Lama relates is substantially corroborated by the account laid out in 1749 (CE) by Gelug historian Sumpa Khenpo ( 1702–1788 CE). At any rate: confronted with the death of both people and cattle combined with harsh, unpredictable weather in an atmosphere of political intrigue and diplomatic insecurity, Gyatso undertook a specific course of action which might be considered somewhat unconventional, even for a religiously affiliated head of state.\n\nAt the end of the earth-bird year of 1669 (CE), a special crypt was constructed, and offerings placed within it in hopes that it might serve as a home in which the disturbed spirit of Drakpa Gyaltsen – an iconoclastic tulku and rival scholar who had died under mysterious circumstances at a time of considerable political turmoil – might finally settle. Reportedly, though, the evil spirit's harmful activities only intensified, manifesting (in part) as atmospheric disturbances including hailstorms, but also causing both people and cattle to fall prey to disease. The deaths of some monks were attributed to the spirit as well – which was named \"Dolgyal\" by combining \"gyalpo\" with the ghost's place of residence. It was only later that Dolgyal would come to be identified with Dorje Shugden () through conflation with a much older Sakya protector of the same name associated with the remote Nepali village of Tsap.\n\nModest but extensive offerings to monks of wheat and tea along with small amounts of gold reportedly resulted in sutra recitations numbering in the tens of thousands. Combined with the performance of many far more complex tantric rituals, the coordinated efforts reached eleven separate district capitals, and spread through no fewer than seventy monasteries including Dorje Drag, Sera, and Drepung. The entire cycle was concluded with an elaborate fire puja offering in which the \"perfidious spirit\" was ritually burnt by seven different groups of practitioners, led by\nthe Dalai Lamas' personal monastery (already known as Namgyal by that time). Thus invoking all of Tibet's dharma protectors – including Nechung – the 5th Dalai Lama charged them to \"not support, protect, or give ... shelter\" to Drakpa Gyaltsen in a formal promulgation which the current 14th Dalai Lama characterizes as \"quite strongly worded\".\n\nRecalling the events of that time later, the 5th Dalai Lama wrote that \"...indirectly these creatures...\" – means, roughly, \"creature\" or \"evil spirit\" – \"...were delivered to the peaceful state of being, released from having to experience the intolerable suffering of bad states of rebirth due to their increasingly negative actions.\" But the unification of Tibet having occurred at least in part on account of scapegoating the departed spirit of a controversial but popular rival lama was not to be without eventual historic consequence.\n\nThe growth of the 19th-Century nonsectarian Rime movement served in part to expose and exacerbate political tensions within the Gelug hierarchy as it had come to organize itself in the centuries following the 5th Dalai Lama's death. Some of his acts were subsequently misconstrued by certain conservative factions within the Gelug order as an \"elevation\" by Lobsang Gyatso of the dangerously volatile Dolgyal (by now, quite thoroughly conflated with the original Sakya protector named Shugden) to the status of Dharmapala – in other words: a particularly forceful emanation of a blissfully awakened buddha's enlightened activity and therefore basically an enlightened being, himself.\n\nThe 13th Dalai Lama therefore sought to clarify his view about Dorje Shugden's status in his letter to Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo, in which he identified Dorje Shugden as a \"wrathful worldly spirit\", the propitiation of which \"contradicts the precepts of taking refuge\". In reply, Phabongka (who is better remembered for his teachings on the graded stages of the path and reputation of conferring Kalachakra empowerments to large crowds of laypeople regardless of his having enthusiastically propitiated Shugden) acknowledged his \"error\". In the same letter, Phabongka said \"...I have propitiated Shugden until now because my old mother told me that Shugden is the deity of my maternal lineage\", thereby acknowledging Shugden practice's provincial and even familial (as well as Sakya) origins.\n\nThe current 14th Dalai Lama, for his part, continues to maintain it was the Fifth's intent to appease the interfering spirit of the \"Gyalpo\" class from \"Dol Chumig Karmo\" – hence his insistence on using the name \"Dolgyal\" to disambiguate a practice he disrecommends from one of a protector of the Sakya school to which he's tied through prior incarnations.\n\nDue largely to the determined cunning of his first regent Sonam Chöphel and the military support of his Mongolian disciple Güsri Khan, in 1642 the 25-year-old 5th Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso inherited military and political control of a nation that had been torn by over a century of power struggles and civil war characterized by factionalism and sectarian allegiances. The general form of government he instituted would remain largely in place until Tibet's military occupation by the People's Republic of China in the 1950s. Nevertheless, Lobsang Gyatso's rule over Tibet included various incidents which, 350 years later, certain keen observers – namely, the heirs of those Kagyupa followers whose patrons lost power during unification or during the quelling of their subsequent rebellions – still consider to have been the abuse of government power.\n\nIn 1648, Tibetans loyal to the Gelug school reportedly joined Mongol forces in coercing monks of certain Kagyu and Bön institutions to embrace specifically Gelug doctrines. Modern Tibetans still differentiate between Bön and Buddhism in common parlance, calling members of the Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools \"nangpa\" (meaning \"insider\"), while referring to practitioners of Bön as \"bönpo\".\n\nThe Jonangpa order belongs to the Kagyupa group of schools, the 7th one to emerge. According to Snellgrove and Richardson, it was a difference in philosophy that caused a bitter schism to arise with the Gelugpa, however Samten Karmay maintains that the 5th Dalai Lama's negative attitude towards the Jonangpa was determined by political rather than philosophical or religious considerations. He records elsewhere that the Fifth Dalai Lama’s personal biographer and Sanskrit teacher the renowned Jonang scholar Jamyang Wangyal Dorje Mondrowa was a master of the Jonang tradition and belonged to a well-known Jonang family from Lato in Tsang with whom the Dalai Lama had good relations.. In any case, it was during Lobsang Gyatso's rule after the civil wars and rebellions of 1640-1643 that Jonangpa institutions, teachings and followers were banished and moved out of central Tibet to be re-established in Amdo for allying with the Tsangpa and fighting against the Ganden Phodrang. In 1650 the Jonangpa printing presses were officially sealed and teaching of their \"zhentong\" philosophical views was forbidden within central Tibet, indicating that the basis of the schism was more philosophical in nature. Then in 1658 the main Jonang monastery Takten Damchö Ling in Lhatse – which had been the monastic seat of the great Jonangpa exponent Taranatha (1575–1634) – was converted to a Gelug institution and renamed Phuntsok Choling.\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's Regent or \"Desi\", Sonam Rapten was, in fact, a fanatical Gelugpa supremacist as well as a shrewd and canny political operator with an eye for the main chance. Being 22 years the Dalai Lama's senior he dominated him as he raised him from the age of 5. In his autobiography \"The Dukula\" the lama repeatedly remarks how he had to defer to the Desi, or had to do as he said, and even as an adult he rarely got his way if he disagreed with Sonam Rapten's wishes.\n\nThat the infamous sectarian policies implemented in the decade after the 1642 civil war were the work of the Desi can be inferred from the decree that the Fifth Dalai Lama issued to him and his administration just as he departed to Beijing in the summer of 1652 to see the Emperor, leaving the Desi behind in Tibet. The issuance of such a decree, at the age of 35, indicates his growing maturity and his firm intention to start imposing his will over that of his Regent concerning such important policies which the Dalai Lama disapproved of. He presents this decree as his instructions to his regent in the form of a testament to be implemented while he was absent in China, and, perhaps, in case he did not return from the long and perilous journey for any reason. In \"The Dukula\", he explains how, before departing, he handed to Sonam Rapten \"for his memory, with explanations, a scroll of the following list concerning what was to be done (in my absence)\". He then specifies what (amongst other things) this decree placed a ban on, and he thus ordered the reversal of specified sectarian policies being implemented, evidently without his approval, by the Desi’s government:\nIn 1674, the 5th Dalai Lama met with 10th Karmapa (\"i.e.\", the specific tulku, or incarnate lama who heads the Karma Kagyu school) Chöying Dorje (1604–1674) at the Potala. This mutual gesture of \"reconciliation\" was reportedly \"welcomed by both parties after the many conflicts and misunderstandings between 1612 and 1642\".\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama issued the edict to appoint Sangye Gyatso as his Desi in 1679, in the same edict he also recognised the Yungdrung Bön as Tibet’s native religion and describes it as being the \"holder of secret mantras \".\n\nThere are some fairly subtle philosophical differences between the Jonang and Gelug schools' respective \"zhentong\" and \"rangtong\" views on voidness. After moving to Amdo the school's distinct transmission lineages of both \"zhentong\" philosophy and Dro Kalachakra completion stage practices could be preserved and survived intact to this day. In late 2001, the current 14th Dalai Lama reportedly composed an \"Aspiration Prayer for the Flourishing of the Jonang Teachings\" entitled in (which might be called quite strongly worded).\n\nThe 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso established a centralized dual system of government under the Gyalwa Rinpoche (\"i.e.\", the institution of the Dalai Lama) which was divided equally between laymen and monks (both Gelugpa and Nyingmapa). This form of government, with few changes, survived up to modern times. He also revitalized the Lhasa Mönlam, the capital city's New Year Festival, which had originally been created by the reformer Je Tsongkhapa in 1409 (CE).\n\nIt was under Gyatso's rule that the \"rule of religion\" was finally firmly established \"even to the layman, to the nomad, or to the farmer in his fields\". This was not the supremacy of the Gelug school over Bön, or over the other Buddhist schools, but \"the dedication of an entire nation to a religious principle\".\n\n\nThe 5th Dalai Lama's official visit, as an independent head of state, to Beijing in 1653 should be understood in the context of the prior relationship which existed between China and Tibet.\n\nEarlier invitations to visit the Manchu court in Beijing had been turned down by both 3rd Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso and 4th Dalai Lama Yonten Gyatso. Analyzing the Ming emperors' repeated invitations of Tibetan lamas from various schools, contemporary Buddhist scholar Alexander Berzin says that \"requests by the Ming emperors for Tibetan lamas to visit China and the freedom the lamas exercised in responding to these requests, characterize the Sino Tibetan relationship at this time as one of mutual independence.\"\n\nFifth Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso established diplomatic relations with the second emperor of the Qing dynasty, accepting the Shunzhi Emperor's 1649 invitation. The Shunzhi Emperor invited him to Beijing instead of Mongolia, following the advice of his Han advisors over the suggestion by his Manchu advisors. The 5th Dalai Lama set out from Lhasa in 1652 accompanied by 3,000 men. The journey to Beijing took nine months. Lobsang Gyatso and his entourage spent two months in the yellow palace which had been especially constructed by the emperor in order to house him.\n\nThe Shunzhi Emperor, who was only 14 years old (13 by Western reckoning) at the time, first met the Dalai Lama in January 1653, honouring him with two grand imperial receptions. Some historians claim that the emperor treated the Dalai Lama as an equal while others dispute this claim. The emperor gave Gyatso a parting gift of an elaborate gold seal reading \"Dalai Lama, Overseer of the Buddhist Faith on Earth Under the Great Benevolent Self-subsisting Buddha of the Western Paradise\". However the Fifth Dalai Lama did not accept it. He wrote that after he left Beijing on his way back to Tibet, \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me\" but \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation.\" Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important Tibetan state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".\n\nThe event is described in Samten Karmay's account as follows:\nThe White Dagoba at Beihai Park was constructed to honour his visit.\n\nThe first documented Europeans to arrive in Tibet may have been the Portuguese Jesuit missionaries, António de Andrade and Manuel Marques who did so in either July or August 1624, when the 5th Dalai Lama would have been about seven or eight years old.\n\nWhile the first two Jesuit mission churches to be established in Tibet followed in direct result of Andrade and Marques' 1624 visit, neither would remain to see the 1642 enthronement of 5th Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso at Samdruptse castle in Shigatse as the temporal ruler of Tibet.\n\nAndrade and Marques were reportedly welcomed warmly by the King and Queen of Guge, becoming the first documented Europeans to enter Tibet. Staying in Tibet for only a month, Andrade and Marques would return to Agra, India by November 1624 to organize a mission trip for the following year. In 1625, with the full support of the King and Queen of Guge, Andrade and Marques established a permanent mission at Tsaparang, in the Garuda Valley of western Tibet's Ngari region.\n\nOn Andrade's advice, a second Jesuit mission was dispatched to southern Tibet from India in 1627. The Portuguese missionaries João Cabral and Estêvão Cacella were reportedly welcomed at Shigatse by the King of Ü-Tsang, and Cabral and Cacella established their mission there in 1628. Cabral and Cacella provided the first information to reach the West about the mystical country of Shambhala (which they transcribed as \"Xembala\") in their reports back to India.\n\nBoth of the Portuguese missions were evacuated in 1635 after becoming embroiled in the power struggles for control of Tibet at that time. It would be twenty-five years before the next documented Europeans visited Tibet.\n\nThe first Europeans to meet a Dalai Lama were probably the two Jesuits, Johannes Grueber of Austria and Albert Dorville (D’Orville). In 1661, Grueber and D'Orville travelled through Lhasa on their way from Peking to Agra, India on an Imperial Passport. It is this expedition from which another jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher's 1667 engraving in \"China Illustrata\" (purported to depict 5th Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso) is derived, based on expedition journals and charts left to him by Grueber.\n\nThe death of the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1682 at the age of 65 was kept hidden until 1696, by Desi Sangye Gyatso, his Prime Minister and, according to persistent rumours, his son, whom he had appointed in 1679. This was done so that the Potala Palace could be finished and to prevent Tibet's neighbors taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas. Desi Sangay Gyatso also served as regent until the assumption of power by the Sixth Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 17th-century Tibet, after centuries of bitter rivalry the Gelug superseded the older sects as the country’s pre-eminent religious-political power. Bitterness and controversial accusations from heirs of older sects, who lost power and prestige, still persist today.\n\nElliot Sperling notes that the \"standard image\" of the Dalai Lamas as \"Nobel Peace Prize laureate[s]\" is a contemporary perception, referring to the 5th Dalai Lama's involvement in military action to establish and maintain the worldly power of the Dalai Lamas.\nLobsang Gyatso was a prolific writer and respected scholar, who wrote in a free style which allowed him to frankly – and sometimes, ironically – express his own deepest feelings and independent interpretations. His canonical works total 24 volumes, in all.\nLobsang Gyatso left an autobiography – entitled in – but far more commonly referred to simply as \"Dukulai Gosang\" – in which, according to Samten Gyaltsen Karmay, he wrote:\n<poem>The official Tsawa Kachu of the Ganden Palace showed me statues and rosaries (that belonged to the Fourth Dalai Lama and other lamas), but I was unable to distinguish between them! When he left the room I heard him tell the people outside that I had successfully passed the tests. Later, when he became my tutor, he would often admonish me and say: \"You must work hard, since you were unable to recognize the objects!\"</poem>\n\nDespite what he wrote above himself later in life, three different English-language histories attest that he was subjected to an earlier object-recognition test, in 1619, when Sonam Rapten, the Chandzeu, went to his family home at Chonggye in great secrecy (since the king had banned the search for the Trulku) to confirm information he had received about the boy. He took with him a number of the late Yonten Gyatsho’s personal belongings (specifically, the Fourth Dalai Lama's personal samta boards, vajra, bell and porcelain bowls all mixed with identical items belonging to others) to submit the less-than two year old candidate to a private recognition test, presumably in front of his family, which the boy passed without any difficulty. It is supposed that everyone present was sworn to secrecy, and that the Dalai Lama did not refer to this test in his autobiography because it occurred when he was not more than two years old and he would have forgotten about it.\n\nThis autobiography has been a rich source of information for research on this period of Tibetan history by scholars and writers. ‘\"Dukula\"’ affords a detailed and objective account of daily events in the author’s life which permits the reader to envision a panoramic view of Lhasan and Tibetan society through most of the 17th century. By 1681 Lobsang Gyatso personally wrote three volumes and his last Regent Desi Sangye Gyatso added another two after his master's death in 1682. These 5 volumes “represent the most important – in both size and content – document of Tibetan autobiographical literature in existence, since they include the memories of two of the greatest statesmen of Tibet”.\n\nHe also wrote in his autobiography that \"When I finished the \"Oral teachings of Manjushri\" [in 1658], I had to leave the ranks of the Gelug. Today [in 1674], having completed the \"Oral teachings of the Knowledge-holders\", I will probably have to withdraw from the Nyingma ranks as well!\"\n\nThe \"Tukdrup Yang Nying Kundü\" or \"Union of All Innermost Essences\" () \"sadhana\" of Padmasambhava's Eight Manifestations comes from a \"pure vision\" () \"terma\" of the 5th Dalai Lama. It is contained in his \"Sangwa Gyachen\" (). (Both the \"sadhana\" and its related empowerment texts were arranged by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.)\n\nThe 5th Dalai Lama \"enthusiastically\" wrote a detailed history of Tibet at the request of Güshi Khan in 1643.\n\n\n\n"}

Mei was known as \"Queen of Peking Opera\". Mei was exclusively known for his female lead roles (\"dan\") and particularly his \"verdant-robed girls\" (\"qingyi\"), young or middle-aged women of grace and refinement. He was considered one of the \"Four Great \"Dan\"\", along with Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xun Huisheng.\n\nMei Lanfang was born in Beijing in 1894 into a family of Peking opera and Kunqu performers (performers of a traditional Chinese theatre composed of drama, ballet, opera, poetry, and music) of Taizhou, Jiangsu ancestry.\n\nAt age 8, Mei Lanfang started training in Chinese opera skills such as acting, singing and acrobatics. Mei Lanfang made his stage debut at the Guanghe Theatre in 1904 when he was 11 years old. In his 50-year stage career, he maintained strong continuity while always working on new techniques. His most famous roles were those of female characters; skillful portrayal of women won him international acclaim, and his smooth, perfectly timed, poised style has come to be known in opera circles as the \"Mei School.\" He also played an important part in continuing the performance tradition of Kunqu, noted particularly for his interpretations of Du Liniang (杜丽娘; in \"The Peony Pavilion\") and Bái Sùzhēn (白素贞; in \"Legend of the White Snake\"). Mei's famous portrayal of Beauty Yu was so historically moving that Wenting Song say he is one of the greatest vocal artists in modern China.\n\nMei was the first artist to spread Beijing Opera to foreign countries, participating in cultural exchanges with Japan, the United States, and other regions. He toured the world, forming friendships with the western contemporaries of his day, including Charlie Chaplin. In 1930 he toured North America, visiting Hollywood, where he was welcomed by Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. In 1935, Mei toured Europe, playing to appreciative audiences in Berlin and Moscow. Seeing Mei perform especially impressed the German playwright Bertold Brecht and influenced his concept of the alienation effect. He served as one of the mentors and guardians of the actress Li Yuru as she began her career.\n\nIn July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and the Imperial Japanese Army soon occupied Beijing. The commander of the Japanese Army ordered Mei to perform for them and appointed Mei to a high rank official position. But Mei refused to sing throughout the duration of the war and endured an impoverished lifestyle until the war ended in 1945.\nAfter 1949 he served as director of China Beijing Opera Theater, director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, and vice-chairman of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Besides his autobiography, \"Forty Years of Life on the Stage\", several of his articles and essays have been published in \"The Collected Works of Mei Lanfang\". Recordings of his best-known performances have been published in \"A Selection of Beijing Operas Performed by Mei Lanfang\". In 2000, the story of his life was filmed in a documentary entitled \"The Worlds of Mei Lanfang\". Acclaimed director Chen Kaige directed \"Forever Enthralled\", a film biography of Mei's life, released in December 2008.\n\nIn 1924, Mei went to Japan after learning about the Great Kantō earthquake that had caused destruction. During his stay, he not only performed, but he also donated to help the cause.\n\nIn the year 1910, Mei married Wang Minghua, and they eventually had one son and one daughter together. While still married to Wang, he married his second wife in 1921, who was also an opera actress. Her name was Fu Zhifang and together, they had nine children. In 1925, he began seeing a third woman, who was also an actress. They lived together unmarried for five years before they broke up.\nMei's daughter Mei Baoyue was a Chinese opera performer. Mei's son Mei Baojiu (1934-2016) was a Chinese opera dan performer.\n\nChen Kaige's 2008 film Forever Enthralled is a biographical account of Mei Lanfang.\n\nIn 2009 the Chinese Google homepage displayed a logo commemorating his 115th birthday on October 22.\n\n\n\n"}

Recorded in his bedroom in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album was launched in Berlin, Germany on 9 October 2005. It was not shown on television, but broadcast to various locations around the world in cinemas and theatres, in a high-definition \"cine-cast\". It was shown on Saturday 22 October 2005 on Channel 4.\n\nThe album's artwork was designed by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, in response to Williams' request that they \"turn [Williams] into a superhero\" for the tour. The \"talismanic images\" and \"witchy hieroglyphs\" include a \"sigil\" that, in Morrison's words, \"can be activated by finding the CD in the shops or pulling the cover up on-screen and pressing Rob's finger.

It is typically long and weighs around . The carapace and abdomen are smooth, and adults are white with pink and brown markings and a conspicuous pair of long, slim claws. \"M. challengeri\" lives in burrows at depths of in a variety of sediments. Although individuals can live for up to 15 years, the species shows low fecundity, where small numbers of larvae hatch at an advanced stage.\n\n\"M. challengeri\" is a significant prey item for ling, as well as being an important fishery species for human consumption; trawlers catch around per year under the limitations of New Zealand's Quota Management System. The species was first collected by the \"Challenger\" expedition of 1872–1876, but only described as separate from related species by Heinrich Balss in 1914. Although originally classified in the genus \"Nephrops\", it was moved in 1972 to a new genus, \"Metanephrops\", along with most other species then classified in \"Nephrops\".\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" is a slender lobster, typically long, but exceptionally up to , and weighing up to each. Its chelipeds (legs bearing the main chelae, or claws) are long, narrow, and slightly unequal. The second and third pairs of pereiopods also end in small claws, but the fourth and fifth pairs do not. The carapace is smooth, and extends forwards into a long, narrow rostrum, only slightly shorter than the carapace.\n\nAdults are mostly white, but the front half of the rostrum, and the sides of the abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the posterior edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.\n\n\"M. challengeri\" is considered to have the most primitive morphology of any species of \"Metanephrops\", having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, \"M. rossensis\". Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the \"thomsoni\" species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of \"Metanephrops\", the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3–4 years, and may live up to 15 years in total. Females produce very large eggs in small numbers; they are typically around in diameter, and are blue in colour. The larvae hatch at the \"zoea\" stage (equivalent to the third zoea of the Northern Hemisphere species \"Nephrops norvegicus\"). The zoea larvae are long, and possess all the appendages of the cephalothorax, including the pereiopods, which are used for swimming, but no pleopods (appendages of the abdomen). This larval stage lasts less than four days, before the young moult into the post-larval stage. The post-larva swims using its pleopods. The post-larva later moults into the adult form. Larvae are rarely seen in the wild, confirming that the development to the bottom-dwelling post-larva is rapid.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" lives around the coasts of New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands, at depths of . It lives in burrows in a variety of \"suitable cohesive\" sediments, and is a significant prey item for ling (\"Genypterus blacodes\"). Lobsters have few parasites, the most important for \"M. challengeri\" being the microsporidian \"Myospora metanephrops\". This can cause \"destruction of the skeletal and heart muscles of infected lobsters\", but its significance for the animals and for the fishing industry remains unclear. When it was described in 2010, \"M. metanephrops\" was the first microsporidian to be isolated from a true lobster.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" has been harvested commercially since the 1980s. Between the season of 1988/89 and 1990/91, the amount of scampi caught around New Zealand increased from only to around . Catch limits were introduced in 1990/91, and now is caught annually by trawlers. The fishery is centred on four areas of continental shelf of the submerged continent Zealandia: the Campbell Plateau around the Auckland Islands, Chatham Rise, along the Wairarapa coast, and in the Bay of Plenty.\n\nMost of the fishing vessels used to capture \"M. challengeri\" are long, with \"double or triple trawl rigs of low headline height\". There is considerable variation in the catch per unit effort between different depths, between different geographical areas and between different years. \"M. challengeri\" is considered a luxury foodstuff. Most of the catch is exported and as a result, it is rarely seen in restaurants in New Zealand.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" was the subject of a 2003 select committee inquiry in the New Zealand parliament, after allegations of corruption arose against officers of the Ministry of Fisheries. Although the allegations were quashed, the inquiry ruled that preferential treatment had been given to the large fishing company Simunovich Fisheries. In response, the government introduced \"M. challengeri\" into their Quota Management System and paid compensation to some fishermen who had a justified grievance. Under QMS, an overall limit of was put in place for \"M. challengeri\" in 2011.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, due in part to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of \"M. challengeri\" vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28 million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11 million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, \"Phocarctos hookeri\", which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.\n\n\"Metanephrops challengeri\" was first described by Heinrich Balss in 1914, under the name \"Nephrops challengeri\". Two specimens had been collected on the \"Challenger\" expedition from benthic \"Globigerina\" ooze at a depth of , on the Challenger Plateau in the Tasman Sea (). They had been included by Charles Spence Bate in his report on the crustaceans collected by the \"Challenger\" expedition, but were not separated from \"\"Nephrops thomsoni\"\" (now \"Metanephrops thomsoni\"), which was described by Spence Bate as a new species. Balss recognised that Spence Bate's \"N. thomsoni\" covered two species and, restricting the name \"M. thomsoni\" to the species containing the type specimens designated by Spence Bate (from the Philippines), created a new species for the species from New Zealand. Balss chose the two specimens seen by Spence Bate to be the type specimens of his new species, \"Nephrops challengeri\". Both were females, and they have been deposited at the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nThe species was transferred to a new genus, \"Metanephrops\" (along with every other extant species then in \"Nephrops\", except its type species, \"Nephrops norvegicus\") by Richard Jenkins of the University of Adelaide in 1972. Jenkins placed \"M. challengeri\" among the \"\"thomsoni\" group\" within the genus \"Metanephrops\", alongside \"M. thomsoni\", \"M. sibogae\", \"M. boschmai\" and \"M. sinensis\". Jenkins inferred that this group of species had originated off northern Australia or in Indonesia, and that \"M. challengeri\" had reached New Zealand in the late Tertiary and displaced \"M. motunauensis\", which formerly lived there. More recently, findings from molecular phylogenetics suggest that \"M. challengeri\" has a basal position in the genus, possibly linked to \"M. neptunus\", and that the genus may have originated at high latitudes in the South Atlantic.\n\n"}

It is to the north and lower than the main Casa Grande and the guest house terrace, with vistas of the ranch, Point San Simeon coastline, and Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 2014, the pool was drained due to severe drought conditions in Southern California. The pool had been leaking and evaporating of water per day. Extensive renovations began in 2017 to completely replace the pool's tile base and fix the leaks which had plagued it since its construction. The pool was temporarily filled for the first time since 2014 that August to make sure the leaks had been repaired before the water was subsequently returned to the local watershed. In August, 2018 the pool restoration was completed and the pool was refilled.\n\nDesigned by architect Julia Morgan, the Neptune Pool with terrace elements was started in 1924. Albert Solon and Frank Schemmel of Solon and Schemmel Tile Company came to Hearst Castle to perform the tile work. The Neptune Pool was built and rebuilt three times, each version a larger size. After the 1926 and 1934 redesigns and re-buildings, it was finally deemed completed by William Randolph Hearst in 1936.\n\nThe Neptune Pool is wide except for the width at the primary axis fountain—alcove section, and the secondary axis pool length is . The depth varies from at the west 'shallow' end, to at pools' main drains.\n\nThe fountains and pool are fed by spring water piped from the Santa Lucia Mountains, and the pool alone holds of water.\n\nLight-veined Vermont marble decorates the flooring and side walls of the swimming and ornamental pools, and the colonnades.\n\nThe swimming pool is surrounded by Ancient Roman Revival and Greek Revival style pavilions and colonnades. The pool's main axis centerpiece and north terminus is elaborated from parts of the façade of an Ancient Roman temple that William Randolph Hearst had purchased in Europe and imported to San Simeon. It is symmetrically framed by the colonnaded pavilions as the secondary axis' west and east terminus elements.\n\n17th-century Italian Neoclassical bas-reliefs are upon the sides of the colonnades. The 'Neptune' and 'Nereid' statues, first atop the cascade, were moved to present positions in the Roman temple's pediment. New classical sculptures were commissioned by sculptor Charles Cassou. His 'Neptune statuary group,' planned from the late 1920s for a small cascade pool, was never installed. His ‘Venus’ was.\n\n\n"}

The tower became the tallest building in the state of Oregon when it was completed in 1972.\n\nThe building and a connected five-story building were designed by Charles Luckman and Associates. Originally named the First National Bank Tower, the building opened on April 17, 1972, and was formally dedicated on May 25, 1972. At that time, the bank occupied the first 21 floors of the tower and the entire connected, five-story building, which is known as the Data Processing Building. The name was changed to the First Interstate Tower in 1980–81, after Western Bancorporation, the parent of First National Bank of Oregon, changed its name to First Interstate Bancorp. The current name was adopted after Wells Fargo purchased First Interstate in 1996. Upon opening in 1972, the Wells Fargo Center dwarfed all other buildings in downtown Portland. Public outcry over the tower's scale and the potential of new development to block views of Mount Hood led to height restrictions on all new development.\n\nThe public areas underwent extensive renovation in 2001, including the addition of more retail space. Renovations were completed in 2002 at a cost of $35 million. Focused on the lobby area, the work included the addition of a display on the bank's history. The center had been the headquarters of Willamette Industries until 2003, when that company was bought by Weyerhaeuser.

She had three brothers and five sisters. Their father believed in giving his daughters 'every educational advantage' and Annette was taught by governesses in Australia and England before attending Cheltenham Ladies' College, Gloucestershire. After some time in France and Germany she trained in social work in England, gaining experience of work in city slums and in London's New Hospital. She met leaders of the women's movement and became well known as an active member of the National Vigilance Association.\n\nIn April 1890, Bear-Crawford rejoined her mother in Victoria. She became a leading force in the growing women's movement which was then most concerned with gaining the franchise. Bear-Crawford believed that 'the vote would be the most effective instrument for improving conditions of life'. She used her fine organizing abilities to strengthen and eventually unite the existing suffrage societies. With the support of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), she formed the Victorian Women's Suffrage (Franchise) League. Then, on her initiative, the United Council for Women's Suffrage was founded in 1894, with representatives from organizations interested in the cause; she was first president and later honorary secretary. The council lobbied politicians and municipal councillors and organized a monster petition in favour of women's suffrage, but failed to persuade members of the Legislative Council to allow the passage of a franchise bill.\n\nBear-Crawford also helped to educate women for public work. An accomplished and logical speaker, she trained other women in the art; Vida Goldstein, who accompanied her to meetings, was shown how to handle hecklers and answer questions. Bear-Crawford constantly addressed WCTU and suffrage meetings and also encouraged women to gain election to school boards of advice. She helped to obtain amendments to legislation affecting women, including the raising of the age of consent to sixteen, and the appointment of women as factory inspectors and to the Benevolent Asylum Committee. She also saw the need for police matrons and women to administer the Infant Life Protection Act (1890), and was one of the first members of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children and of the Victorian Vigilance Society. She was a stimulus and inspiration to Victorian feminists of the time. Perhaps her most enduring achievement was the foundation in Melbourne of the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women, which grew out of her concern for the welfare of unmarried mothers and their children; she organized the successful Queen's Willing Shilling fund in 1897 to launch the scheme but did not live to see the hospital opened.\n\nIn 1894, aged 41, Bear-Crawford had married William Crawford, a solicitor nine years her junior, and was thereafter known as Mrs Bear-Crawford. Her marriage brought her happiness but did little to change the even flow of her life. Beatrice Webb described her as a 'gentle-tempered intelligent woman who keeps me company in the dowdiness of her dress'. Domestic, affectionate and well-read, she had a 'lovable, sunny nature', but as an ardent feminist she believed strongly in women's equality with men; the Age reported in an editorial of 22 September 1897 that she had 'uttered the rather astounding dictum that most things worth having were originally produced by women. Man, she said, is destructive, while woman is constructive'.\n\nIn November 1898, after a farewell evening at the Prahran Town Hall, she left for England to attend the Women's International Conference. Her husband joined her in London only three weeks before she died of pneumonia, on 7 June 1899, aged 46. On 4 July a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne; in 1902 a statue was unveiled in London to her memory and, in tribute to her work in England and Australia, her English friends placed a bronze plaque on the wall of Christ Church, South Yarra. In 2007 Bear-Crawford was inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.\n\n"}

Some researchers claimed that the ethnonym, and thereby ethnic origin, dated to ancient history. The theories are based on new findings in genetics and the presumed connection to various Roman-era ethnonyms (tribes) and toponyms.\n\nVarious authors mentioned names of Serbs ( / Срби) and Sorbs (Upper Sorbian: \"Serbja\"; Lower Sorbian: \"Serby\") in different variants: Surbii, Suurbi, Serbloi, Zeriuani, Sorabi, Surben, Sarbi, Serbii, Serboi, Zirbi, Surbi, Sorben, etc. These authors used these names to refer to Serbs and Sorbs in areas where their historical (or current) presence was/is not disputed (notably in the Balkans and Lusatia), but there are also sources that mention the same or similar names in other parts of the World (most notably in the Asiatic Sarmatia in the Caucasus). Attempts of various researchers to connect these names with modern Serbs produced various theories about the origin of the Serb people.\n\n\n\nAccording to \"De Administrando Imperio\" (, written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII (912-959), the Serbs originated from the \"White Serbs\" who lived on the \"other side of Turkey\" (name used for Hungary), in the area that they called \"Boiki\". White Serbia bordered to the Franks and White Croatia. DAI claims that after two brothers inherited the rule from their father, one of them took half of the people and migrated to the Byzantine Empire (i.e. to the Balkans), which was governed by Emperor Heraclius (610-641). According to German historian L. A. Gebhardi, the two brothers were sons of Dervan, the \"dux\" (duke) of the Surbi (Sorbs).\n\nIn the Balkans, Serbs settled first an area near Thessaloniki and then area around rivers Tara, Ibar, Drina and Lim (in the present-day border region of Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also Dalmatia), and joined with surrounding South Slavic tribes that came to the Balkans earlier (in the 6th century) and the Paleo-Balkan people. Over time, the South Slavic and mostly Illyrian tribes of this territory mixed with the Serbs and also adopted Serb name as their own.\n\nAnother part of the White Serbs did not migrate southwards, but remained in the Elbe region. Descendants of these White Serbs are the present day Lusatian Serbs (Sorbs), who still live in the Lusatia (Lužica, Lausitz) region of eastern Germany.\n\nThere are also opinions that data from \"De administrando imperio\" that describes Serb migration to the Balkans is not correct and that Serbs came to the Balkans from Eastern Slavic lands, together with other South Slavs.\n\nThe Emperor Constantine III (641) transferred a part of the Slavs from the Balkans (Vardar region) to Asia Minor. There these migrants founded the city of Gordoservon, the name of which gives grounds for supposing that among its founders there were Serbs. The city was also known under names Gordoserbon and Servochoria.\n\nTheory about Iranian origin of the Serb ethnonym assumes that ancient Serbi / Serboi from north Caucasus (Asiatic Sarmatia) were a Sarmatian (Alanian) tribe. The theory subsequently assumes that Alanian Serbi were subdued by the Huns in the 4th century and that they, as part of the Hunnic army, migrated to the western edge of the Hunnic Empire (in the area of Central Europe near the river Elbe, later designated as White Serbia in what is now Saxony (eastern Germany) and western Poland). After the Hunnic leader Attila died (in 453), Alanian Serbi presumably became independent and ruled in the east of the river Saale (in modern-day Germany) over the local Slavic population. Over time, they, it is argued, intermarried with the local Slavic population of the region, adopted Slavic language, and transferred their name to the Slavs. According to Tadeuš Sulimirski, similar event could occur in the Balkans or Serbs who settled in the Balkans were Slavs who came from the north and who were ruled by already slavicized Alans.\nDeformed human skulls that are connected to the Alans are also discovered in the area that was later designated as \"White Serbia\". According to Indo-European interpretation, different sides of the World are designated with different colors, thus, white color is designation for the west, black color for the north, blue or green color for the east and red color for the south. According to that view, White Serbia and White Croatia were designated as western Serbia and western Croatia, and were situated in the west from some hypothetical lands that had same names and that presumably existed in the east.\n\nIt is possible that the Alanian Serbi in Sarmatia, similarly like other Sarmatian/Iranian peoples on the northern Caucasus, originally spoke an Indo-European Iranian language similar to present-day Ossetian. The Ossetian language is a member of Eastern Iranian branch of Iranian languages, along with Pashtun, Yaghnobi and languages of the Pamir. One of the Pashtun tribal groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan is known as Sarbans (Sarbani) and Pashtuns are believed to be of Scythian descent while their language is classified as East Scythian (Sarmatian language is also grouped within Scythian branch).\n\nIn Polish history, the Polish nobility claimed to be direct descendants of the historic Sarmatian people (see: Sarmatism) and this might be connected with historical White Serbia and White Croatia, which included parts of present-day Poland. \n\nThis theory assumes that Serbs are an autochthonic people in the Balkans and Podunavlje, where they presumably lived before historical Slavic and Serb migration to the Balkans in the 6th-7th centuries. Proponents of this theory (for example Jovan I. Deretić, Olga Luković Pjanović, Miloš Milojević) claimed that Serbs either came to the Balkans long before the 7th century or Serb 7th century migration to the Balkans was only partial and Serbs who, according to \"De administrando imperio\", came from the north founded in the Balkans other Serbs that already lived there. It is suggested that ancient city of Serbinum in Pannonia was named after these hypothetical autochthonic Serbs. In mainstream historiography this is considered to be a fringe theory, and the methods used by its proponents are often pseudoscientific.\n\n\n\n"}

Once connected, a user can simply enter the commands to send a message to a pager connected to that network. For example, you could then issue the PAGE command with the number of the device you would like to send the message to. After that issue the MESS command with the text of the message you wish to send following it. You can then issue the SEND command to send out the message to the pager and then QUIT, or send another message to a different device.

It is a prequel to \"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"Hannibal\", and \"Red Dragon\". The film is an adaptation of Thomas Harris' 2006 novel of the same name and tells the story of Lecter's evolution into a cannibalistic serial killer.\n\nThe film was directed by Peter Webber from a screenplay by Harris, and stars Gaspard Ulliel as the title character with additional roles played by Gong Li, Rhys Ifans and Dominic West. Filming took place at Barrandov Studios in Prague. It was produced by the Dino De Laurentiis Company and was released in France on February 7, 2007, and in Italy, United Kingdom, and the United States on February 9, 2007. Theatrical distribution was handled by Momentum Pictures in the U.K., and by The Weinstein Company and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the U.S.. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, though Ulliel's performance as Lecter was generally praised. It grossed $82.2 million against a $50 million budget.\n\nIn 1941, eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter lives in Lecter Castle in Lithuania. The German invasion of the Soviet Union turns the Baltic region into part of the bloodiest front line of World War II. Lecter, his younger sister Mischa, and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be re-occupied by the Soviet Union. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa. Then, the soldiers kill and eat her.\n\nBy 1949, Lithuania is under Soviet rule and Lecter Castle has been converted into an orphanage, which also houses Hannibal. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, Lady Murasaki. While in France, Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Pascal Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, as she leaves the butcher's head on the gates in front of the station during Lecter's interview, Lecter accepts responsibility for the crime.\n\nEventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a sodium thiopental injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution. His subsequent flashback reveals the men who had killed Mischa had cannibalized her as well. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search of his sister's remains. He excavates the ruins of the lodge where his family died, and upon finding Mischa's remains, he gives her a proper burial. He also unearths the dog-tags of the deserters who killed his sister. One of them, Enrikas Dortlich, sees him arrive in the country and attempts to kill him but is incapacitated by Lecter. After he buries Mischa's remains, Lecter forces Dortlich to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of his gang, then decapitates Dortlich with a horse-drawn pulley. Dortlich's blood splashes on Lecter's face, and he licks it off.\n\nLecter then visits Kolnas's restaurant in Fontainebleau. He finds his young daughter and notices Mischa's bracelet on her. He gives her Kolnas's dogtag. Dortlich's murder puts the rest of the group on alert and, because of the similarity to the first murder, places Lecter under renewed suspicion from Popil. Grutas, now a sex trafficker, dispatches a second member of the group, Zigmas Milko, to kill him. Lecter kills Milko instead, drowning him in formaldehyde inside his laboratory. Popil then tries to dissuade him from hunting the gang. During a confrontation with Lady Murasaki, she begs him not to get revenge. He refuses, claiming that he made a promise to Mischa. He then attacks Grutas in his home but Grutas is rescued by his bodyguards.\n\nGrutas kidnaps Lady Murasaki and calls Lecter, using her as bait. Lecter recognizes the sounds of Kolnas's birds from his restaurant in the background. Lecter goes there and plays on Kolnas's emotions by threatening his children. Kolnas gives up the location of Grutas's boat, but Lecter kills him when Kolnas goes for Lecter's gun. Lecter goes to the houseboat and finds Grutas assaulting Lady Murasaki. In a final confrontation, Grutas claims that Lecter had also consumed his sister in broth fed to him by the soldiers, and he was killing them to keep this fact secret. Enraged by the revelation, Lecter eviscerates Grutas by repeatedly carving his sister's initial into his body. Lady Murasaki, finally disturbed by his behavior, flees from him even after he tells her that he loves her. The houseboat is incinerated, but Lecter, assumed to be dead, emerges from the woods. He then hunts down the last member of the group, Grentz, in Melville, Canada, before leaving for the United States.\n\n\"Hannibal Rising\" received generally negative reviews from film critics, though Ulliel's performance as Lecter was generally praised. The film garnered a 16% approval rating from 143 critics—an average rating of 3.9 out of 10—on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which said, \"\"Hannibal Rising\" reduces the horror icon to a collection of dime-store psychological traits.\" \nMetacritic provides a score of 35% based on reviews from 30 critics, which indicates \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. The film was nominated for, but did not win, two Golden Raspberry Awards. They were for Worst Prequel or Sequel (lost to \"Daddy Day Camp\") and Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie (lost to \"I Know Who Killed Me\").\n\nThe film opened at #2 in the United States with $13.4 million, less than half of the $33.7 million opening of \"Norbit\", which was released during the same week as \"Hannibal Rising\". In its second week of release, \"Hannibal Rising\" dropped to #7 at the U.S. box office, making $5.5 million, a 59% drop from the previous week. It dropped out of the top 10 U.S. grossing films in its third week of release at #13 with $1,706,165 in revenue, a 69% drop from the previous week. After a theatrical release of 91 days, the final total North American domestic gross of the film was $27,669,725, less than the opening weekend gross of both \"Hannibal\" and \"Red Dragon\" ($58,003,121 and $36,540,945, respectively).\n\nThe DVD was released on 29 May 2007 and sold 480,861 units in the opening weekend, generating revenue of $10,574,133. As of August 2009, the film has grossed $23,242,853 from DVD sales alone. Blu-ray sales or DVD rentals are not included.\n\n"}

The two locomotives, Amtrak GE P32-8BWH #511 leading and EMD F40PHR #398 trailing, and eight of the twelve cars derailed, four of them falling 30 feet (9 m) off a trestle bridge into a dry river bed. Mitchell Bates, a sleeping car attendant, was killed. Seventy-eight people were injured, 12 of them seriously and 25 were hospitalized.\n\nFour typewritten notes, attacking the ATF and the FBI for the 1993 Waco Siege, criticizing local law enforcement, and signed \"Sons of the Gestapo\", were found near the scene of the wreck, indicating that the train had been sabotaged. All four notes were similar. Two of the notes were found by Neal Hallford and Craig Lembke, passengers traveling from Oklahoma to San Diego.\n\nIt was found that the rails had been shifted out of position to cause the derailment, but only after they had been connected with wires. This kept the track circuit closed, circumventing safety systems designed to warn locomotive engineers of track problems, and suggested that the saboteurs had a working knowledge of railroads. The attack was likened to the 1939 wreck of the \"City of San Francisco\", in which a similar method killed 24 people.\n\nFollowing the incident, Amtrak President Thomas Downs told CNN that improved monitoring and security measures have greatly reduced the chances of a similar incident. \n\nThe saboteurs were never identified. The FBI now believes that the \"Sons of the Gestapo\" terrorist group was fictitious and invented to conceal a plan to wreck and rob a freight train. It is also thought that the sabotage may have been done by a disgruntled rail worker who used the notes to mislead investigators and conceal the real motive.\n\nAfter 1996, the \"Sunset Limited\" was rerouted to south of Phoenix (approaching no closer than Maricopa) due to the desire of Southern Pacific to abandon this stretch of track (leading to and through Phoenix, AZ) for its through trains between southern New Mexico and southern California. The section of track on which the wreck took place is now used as storage track only.\n\nThe causes of this wreck have been explored in two major documentaries, \"Why Trains Crash: Blood on the Tracks\", and \"Derailed: America's Worst Train Wrecks\". It has also been featured on the May 10, 1996, episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\".\n\nThe case remains unsolved, but on April 10, 2015, the Phoenix office of the FBI announced a reward of $310,000 for information about the derailment leading to the capture of those responsible.\n\n\n"}

His parents were Carl Friedrich Detroit and Henriette Jeanette Severin. The French family name points to Huguenot ancestry, as a descendant of Protestant refugees from France in the 16th or 17th century. During his teenage years in 1843 he ran away to sea, and traveled to the Ottoman Empire, where he embraced Islam and was circumcised. There, in 1846, Âli Pasha, later Grand Vizier, sent him to a military school. He received a commission in the Ottoman Army in 1853 and fought against Russia in the Crimean War.

It was built between 1713-1719 by the East India Company under the leadership of Governor Joseph Collett as a defensive fort for the British East India Company's Residency there. It was one of the strongest British forts in the eastern region, second only to Fort St. George in Madras, India.\n\nThe fort is made of bricks 50 to 180 centimeters in thickness. The 2000 Enggano earthquake, which registered 7.9 on the moment magnitude scale, and of 2007, with its 3.5-meter tsunami, had no effect on the strongly built fort.\n\nThe fort has a rectangular layout, with an arrowhead-shaped bastion on each corner. The entrance to the fort is in the southwest, protected by a ravelin. A dry moat follows the trace of the fort. A wooden bridge spans the ditch that separates the main building from the front building. The southwest side has an arch entrance with a wooden door. The fort encompasses 2.7 hectares, and stands on a site of 4.4 hectares.\n\nThe British East India Company built the fort between 1713–1719. In 1714 Governor Collett obtained permission to build a new fort in Bencoolen. He named the new fort, which he built two miles from the older fort (Fort York), Fort Marlborough.\n\nThe fort was built on an artificial hill, and construction, using both convict and local labor, took several years to complete. During that period, the civil officers and the military garrison were divided between the old and the new fort.\n\nIn April 1715 Governor Collett sent a copy of the plan of the first Fort Marlborough; the plan showed that the fort was walled with earth ramparts and ditch, with gun platforms on the bastions. The pace of construction was slow.\n\nIn 1760, during the Seven Years' War, a French squadron under the command of Charles Hector, Comte d'Estaing took the fort and used it as a base to attack and subdue other English settlements on the west coast of Sumatra. Before returning to the Mascarenes, he ransomed the fort back to the English.\n\nAt one time, the native people of Bengkulu burned the fort, forcing the inhabitants to flee to Madras. They returned in 1724 after an agreement was reached. In 1793, another attack on the fort occurred, killing one English officer, Robert Hamilton. Another attack happened in 1807, killing a resident, Thomas Parr. Both are commemorated with monuments in Bengkulu City erected by the British colonial government. The monument to Parr is southeast of the fortress.\n\nThe British transferred Bengkulu, then known as Bencoolen, to Dutch control under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which defined British and Dutch spheres of influence. In exchange, the Dutch ceded Malacca to the British and gave up their resistance to British occupation of Singapore. In 1837, the fort had about 60 Dutch soldiers occupying it. The Japanese occupied the fort during their occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942–1945). Then, during the Indonesian National Revolution period, the fort housed the headquarters of the Indonesian national police until the Dutch reoccupied the fort. When the Dutch left Indonesia in 1950, the Indonesian Army took over the fort. In 1977, the fort was handed over to the Department of Education and Culture to be restored and converted into a heritage site.\n\n"}

It is the usual connecting point for travellers heading to Pulau Ubin or Malaysia by ferry. Fishermen in the kelongs located in the Serangoon Harbour offshore also use this jetty as a drop off point to come onto mainland. Changi Village also has many resorts and leisure facilities to cater for a weekend getaway for many Singaporeans. The area is classified by Urban Redevelopment Authorities as under the planning area of Changi and in the subzone of Changi Point. It is also classified under District 17 for property indexing.\n\nChangi Village has its early beginnings as a kampong village. The place was first redeveloped by the British as a summer house and a getaway location from the city centre of Singapore, in the 1890s, and was prized for its tranquillity and remoteness. The existence of the resorts there today still bear testament to the original redevelopments there. Starting from the 1920s, the British started building up Changi as tension across Asia and Europe started to build in anticipation for war. The infamous old Changi Hospital was also built there as a result. During World War II, the place saw mass mobilisation of Allied troops in anticipation of the possible landing and invasion by the Imperial Japanese troops who landed on the nearby Pulau Ubin. However the manoeuvre by the Japanese was a bluff that drew vital Allied troops from the West of Singapore that eventually was the landing site of the Japanese troops. The area as part of the greater Changi defence also saw action of 3 giant artillery guns, also known as the Johore battery, used in the defence of Singapore. Their use and effectiveness in the defence of Singapore has often been controversial. The Sook Ching massacre took place throughout the war at the neighbouring Changi Beach Park too. After the war, the British rebuilt the area to become both a resort and an accommodation for ANZUK soldiers and their families as they continued to maintain military facilities in the nearby Changi Camp. In the 1970s, after the independence of Singapore, the land around Changi was redeveloped for the construction of the Changi Airport. The HDB started building low-rise flats at Changi Village after the land clearance. Changi Village was then spruced up and amenities like the bus terminal were built. In 1997 the operations of the old Changi Hospital was moved to the new Changi General Hospital at Simei. The Government of Singapore has pledged in 2005 that they would try to revive the \"ghost town\". As of 2014 the place is on track to being a hub for recreational activities as resorts and clubs in the area are undergoing refurbishment and tender for leisure and food and beverage operators are being rolled out. Despite the recent redevelopments, Changi Village continues to be relatively laid back compared to the rest of Singapore.\n\nThere are currently no public government schools located in Changi Village and there were not known to be any throughout its history. However, the BNP Paribas Campus, the first training institute in the Asia-Pacific region that seeks to train employees in the region, is located in Changi Village.\n\nThere is a hawker centre located here and it is right next to the bus and ferry terminals. The hawker center is famous for its nasi lemak stall, where long queues are often seen. Stalls selling delicious wanton (fried fritters) which are recommended by many television programs and companies are also available here. Many residents living in the nearby estates of Pasir Ris, Tampines and Simei drive to Changi Village for drinks in the evening. Many of the coffeeshops are open till past midnight every day. In June 2012, the centre was closed for renovations. It has since reopened and business appears to be going very well, as of August 2014. There is a great variety of food to choose from at the hawker stalls.\n\nThere are many chalets, hotels and resorts in the area namely:\n\nThere are also a couple of places to stay overnight on the neighbouring Pulau Ubin island namely:\n\nThe Changi Golf Course has two separated ranges at the area.\n\nAt the east end of Changi Village there is a People's Association Water Venture that offers kayaking courses and rentals. While near the west end there is the Changi Sailing Club that offers sailing courses.\n\nThere is a walkway to the nearby Changi Beach Park, where many families gather over the weekend for a nice picnic with a view of the nearby islands. There is also a boardwalk that runs along the coastline of Changi Village for visitors to enjoy the scenery.\n\nThe Changi Park Connector which runs through the estate connects Changi Beach Park with Pasir Ris Park. At the other end of Changi Beach Park there is the Coastal Park Connector which runs all the way to the East Coast Park.\n\nPlaces of worship in the area include the Maranatha Bible Presbyterian Church and Sree Ramar Hindu Temple.\n\nThe area falls under the jurisdiction of the Bedok Police Division and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ.\n\nThere are no MRT stations in the near vicinity of the area.\n\nChangi Village Bus Terminal was opened in 1975 to take over operations from the former smaller road side \"Changi Point Bus Terminal\". It was built over the site of the former Changi Cinema. The bus terminal comprises a small boarding and alighting berth area for bus services that is directly adjacent to the hawker centre. The bus terminal continues to be operated by SBS Transit despite its close location to the areas where Go-Ahead Group bus services operate.\n\nBus services 2, 29, 59 and 109 operate from the terminal and head towards Kampong Bahru Bus Terminal, Tampines Bus Interchange, Bishan Bus Interchange, and Serangoon Bus Interchange respectively. Service 2 additionally goes to every MRT station on the East West line between Tanah Merah and Bugis. There are more bus services that ply Loyang Avenue which lies directly south of the area, these services are 9, 19 and 89 which originate from the Changi Airfreight Centre.\n\nA ferry terminal, named \"Changi Point Ferry Terminal\", is located here. There are small passenger ferries which lead to the north-eastern islands (e.g. Pulau Ubin) and also to some destinations in Johor, Malaysia. The popular bumboat ferry ride to Pulau Ubin costs S$3 each way and takes around 15 minutes. Usually there is a short wait until each bumboat ferry has 12 passengers. Passengers arriving via ferry to this terminal have to undergo security screening of personnel and baggage from whichever location they are arriving from (including Pulau Ubin) for security reasons.\n"}

It was a bridge line running northeast–southwest across northwestern New Jersey, connecting the line to the Poughkeepsie Bridge at Maybrook, New York with Easton, Pennsylvania, where it interchanged with various other companies.\n\nThe Warwick Valley Railroad was organized March 8, 1860 as a branch of the New York and Erie Rail Road, branching from it at Greycourt southwest to Warwick, New York. It opened in 1862 and was operated by the Erie.\n\nThe Pequest and Wallkill Railroad was chartered by 1870 to build an extension in New Jersey, running from Belvidere on the Delaware River and Belvidere Delaware Railroad northeast to the New York state line. The Lehigh and Hudson River Railroad was chartered later as a competitor, planning to build from Belvidere to McAfee, with the Wawayanda Railroad running the rest of the way to the state line. In April/May 1881, the three companies merged to form a new Lehigh and Hudson River Railroad and on April 1, 1882, the Warwick Valley Railroad joined, forming the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway (L&HR).\nIn the meantime, the Sussex Railroad had built a branch from Hamburg to South Vernon (McAfee); the L&HR bought this around 1881. The Warwick Valley Railroad had built an extension southwest to McAfee in March 1880, and the full line opened August 14, 1882, connecting Belvidere, New Jersey to Greycourt, New York.\n\nThe Orange County Railroad was chartered on November 28, 1888 and opened the following year, extending the line northeast from Greycourt to Maybrook. At Maybrook, the line junctioned with the Central New England Railway, continuing east via the Poughkeepsie Bridge over the Hudson River to New England. Trackage rights were obtained over a short piece of the New York, Ontario and Western Railway from the junction at Burnside west to the major junction at Campbell Hall.\nThe South Easton and Phillipsburg Railroad of New Jersey, and the South Easton and Phillipsburg Railroad of Pennsylvania was organized on July 25, 1889 to build a bridge over the Delaware River between Easton, Pennsylvania and Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The former built 460' on the New Jersey side, while the latter built 850' on the Pennsylvania side. Bridge construction began on November 19, 1889, and concluded the following year on October 2. \"The South Easton and Phillipsburg Railroad of New Jersey and South Easton and Phillipsburg of Pennsylvania were consolidated with the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway on April 2, 1912.\" Subsequently, the L&HR obtained trackage rights over 13 miles of the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) Belvidere Delaware Railroad between Phillipsburg and Belvidere;once the bridge was completed, the L&HR had a continuous line from Maybrook to Easton. At Easton, an interchange could be made with the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad, while interchange with the PRR was at Phillipsburg. In 1908, L&HR lost the trackage rights from Phillipsburg to Belvidere as PRR took them back.\n\nThe L&HR eventually obtained trackage rights over the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's (DL&W) Sussex Railroad from the junction at Andover south to Port Morris, where it interchanged with the main line of the DL&W.\n\nThe Mine Hill Railroad was the only branch built. It ran south from a junction at Franklin, New Jersey to the mines of the New Jersey Zinc Company at Sterling Hill, New Jersey.\n\nFrom October 1912 until January 1916, the L&HR hosted the PRR's \"Federal Express\" passenger trains on the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route between Phillipsburg and Maybrook. With the completion of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City on September 9, 1917, the \"Federal Express\" resumed service via Penn Station and the New Haven Line direct. At its peak, L&HR stretched 86 miles between Easton and Maybrook, acting as a bridge line and hauling anthracite coal from a number of mines along its system.\n\nThe L&HR filed for Chapter 77 bankruptcy on April 19, 1972, partly due to Penn Central's decision to operate over other routes in order to avoid the aging Poughkeepsie Bridge.\n\nPost-bankruptcy, the L&HR continued to operate a nocturnal daily freight. During the mid-1970s, the L&HR became part of a proposal to run \"Bunny Ski Trains\" between Hoboken, New Jersey, and the Playboy Resort (Great Gorge) in Vernon, New Jersey. The proposed service, which would have run on weekends during the winter, would have retrieved passengers westbound along the Erie Lackawanna Railway's (EL) Morristown Line to Netcong, New Jersey, then run along a short section of the remaining Sussex Branch to Andover Junction in Andover, New Jersey, and then northbound along the L&HR to the Playboy Club. The service would have utilized EL's new commuter consists, but was met with stiff opposition from EL management, which was anticipating a merger with other northeastern US railroads and did not want to enter into a venture that it viewed as a potential money-loser. The Bunny Ski Train remained a viable proposal until the remaining vestige of the Sussex Branch was removed in July 1977, after it became clear that it was no longer needed as a connector to the L&HR.\nAs such, in 1976 the L&HR was merged into Conrail. Subsequently, the section between Belvidere, New Jersey and Sparta, New Jersey (Sparta Junction) was abandoned. The tracks, however, remained in place until approximately 1988, when the right-of-way between these two points was acquired by land developer Gerald Turco from Conrail. Turco had also acquired most of the Lackawanna Cut-Off as part of the same deal. Conrail removed the tracks south of Sparta Junction; however, the section north of that point was already being considered by the New York, Susquehanna & Western (NYS&W) as part of a combined regional freight route with Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The line from Warwick to Campbell Hall, New York is currently leased to the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad.\n\nIn New Jersey, the NYS&W owns the L&HR line north of Sparta to the state line. North of the state line, it is owned by NS which had acquired the line during the breakup of Conrail. Both portions of the line are leased to and operated by the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad.\n\n"}

It is an amalgamated brand name created out of two previously separate independent companies that Unilever took over: Kwality of India and Wall's of Great Britain.\nKwality Wall's frozen desserts do not contain milk products, but vegetable fat/oil, and hence cannot be termed as \"ice-cream\".\n\nKwality, the original Indian company, was founded in 1956, and was the first in the region to import machinery for the mass production and sale of ice cream on a commercial scale. In 1995, in view of the growth potential of the frozen confections market, Kwality entered into an agreement with Lever, and has since been known by its current umbrella name. At the same time, other brands acquired by Hindustan Unilever, such as Gaylord-Milkfood, were phased out in favour of promoting the Kwality Wall's brand. This arrangement allows for local production and sale of Wall's products that are popular in its home market, such as the Cornetto cone, and to create local variations on others, such as the Feast Jaljeera Blast.

At age 15 in 1986, he began as a hip-hop DJ before discovering dance music in the 90’s. He was the resident at the famed Atomic Nightclub in Ottawa from 97-01. He has been touring globally as a DJ and producing melodic dance music since 2000.\n\nGraham was the resident at Atomic Nightclub in Ottawa from 1997 - 2001. After being discovered and signed to Hope Recordings one of his first productions Airtight was noticed by Nick Warren and Paul Oakenfold in 2000. Oakenfold subsequently put two of Graham's tracks on his CD \"Another World. Tiesto also put Airtight on his \"In Search of Sunrise 2\" CD. That same year Airtight was nominated for a Juno Award. He gained immediate acclaim and was voted #23 in the DJMag top 100 DJs for 2001 and chosen to mix the famous \"Transport\" CD Series that year.\n\nGraham created the \"Shine\" concept in 2002 which included a mix CD a label (Shinemusic), and club nights.\n2004 Graham signed two singles to Sander Kleinenberg's label \"Little Mountain\" entitled \"Does She Know Yet?\" and \"Automatic Weapon\".

{"id": "1976821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976821", "title": "Skype for Business Server", "text": "Skype for Business Server\n\nSkype for Business Server (formerly Microsoft Office Communications Server and Microsoft Lync Server) is real-time communications server software that provides the infrastructure for enterprise instant messaging, presence, VoIP, ad hoc and structured conferences (audio, video and web conferencing) and PSTN connectivity through a third-party gateway or SIP trunk. These features are available within an organization, between organizations and with external users on the public internet or standard phones (on the PSTN as well as SIP trunking).\n\nOne basic use of Lync Server is instant messaging (IM) and presence within a single organization. This includes support for rich presence information, file transfer and voice and video communication. Lync uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment for NAT traversal and TLS encryption to enable secure voice and video both inside and outside the corporate network.\n\nLync Server also supports remote users, both corporate users on the Internet (e.g. mobile or home workers) as well as users in partner companies. Lync supports identity federation, enabling interoperability with other corporate IM networks. Federation can be configured either manually (where each partner manually configures the relevant edge servers in the other organization) or automatically (using the appropriate SRV records in the DNS).\n\nMicrosoft Lync Server uses Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling along with the SIMPLE extensions to SIP for IM and presence. Media is transferred using RTP and SRTP. The live meeting client uses Persistent Shared Object Model (PSOM) to download meeting content. The communicator client also uses HTTPS to connect with the web components server to download address books and expand distribution lists. By default, supported combinations include encrypted communications using SIP over TLS and SRTP as well as unencrypted SIP over TCP and RTP. Microsoft has published details of supported configuration for qualified vendors through Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program (UCOIP).\n\nIM is only one portion of the Lync suite. The other major components are VoIP telephony and video conferencing through the desktop communicator client. Remote access is possible using the desktop, mobile and web clients.\n\nSeveral third parties have incorporated Lync functionality on existing platforms. HP has implemented OCS on its Halo video conferencing platform.\n\nWhen Microsoft Office Live Communications Server was originally launched on 29 December 2003, it replaced the Exchange Instant Messenger Service that had been included in Exchange 2000, but which was removed from the Exchange 2003 feature set. Holders of Exchange 2000 licenses which included Software Assurance were entitled to receive Live Communications Server as an upgrade, along with Exchange 2003; however, Live Communications Server Client Access Licenses were purchased as normal for new users.\n\nOCS R2 was announced at VoiceCon in Amsterdam in October 2008, a year after releasing Office Communications Server 2007.\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 in February 2009. The R2 release added the following features:\n\n\nMicrosoft Lync Server 2010 reached general availability in November 2010. Microsoft Lync 2013 was released to manufacturing in October 2012 with SP1 being released in March 2014.\nIn 2015, the new version of Lync become Skype for Business with a new client experience, new server release and updates to the service in Office 365. Microsoft has stated that general availability for Skype for Business Server 2019 is targeted for the end of 2018.\n\n\nMicrosoft Lync is the primary client application released with Lync Server. This client is used for IM, presence, voice and video calls, desktop sharing, file transfer and ad hoc conferences. With Lync 2013 there will be a release of Lync Light Client with fewer features.\nMicrosoft also ships the Microsoft Attendant Console. This is a version of the Lync more oriented towards receptionists or delegates / secretaries or others who get a large volume of inbound calls.\n\nPersistent Group Chat functionality (introduced with Lync Server 2010) is only supported on the Windows OS client at this time. This requires an additional server or multiple servers for processing group chat transactions.\n\nOther client software and devices include:\nThe documentation of Lync 2013 contains references to Lync Room Edition Devices - these are anticipated to provide close to immersive experience.\n\nLinux support:\n\nFisil makes the only available supported Linux client for Lync. The unifiedme.co.uk reference lists a Pidgin-based workaround, but according to the information at CERN, it has important limitations. The Damaka reference leads to the Google+ main page and has no information on a Linux client that I could find. The Fisil reference goes to a project management company that can write custom software.\n\nLync Server also has the capability to log and archive all instant message traffic passing through the server and to create Call Detail Records for conferences and voice. These features can help provide compliance with legal requirements for many organizations. The Archiving server is not an overall end-to-end compliance solution, as archiving requires you to install the Archiving Server and to configure front end servers accordingly.\n\nLync Server also enables organizations to interoperate with four external IM services: AOL Instant Messenger, Microsoft Messenger service, Yahoo! Messenger, and Google Talk. PIC was first introduced with Service Pack 1 for Live Communications Server 2005, PIC is licensed separately for Yahoo, but is free for AOL and Messenger service for customers with Software Assurance. Microsoft announced that effective 30 June 2014, they will no longer support PIC connectivity to AOL/AIM\n\n The third-party SIPE plugin enables third-party clients such as Pidgin, Adium and Miranda IM as well as clients using the Telepathy framework to support MS Lync Servers with some limitation (Audio but no SRTP, No Video) via the extended version of SIP/SIMPLE.\n\nLync Server has an XMPP gateway server to federate with external XMPP servers. With Lync Server 2013, XMPP is natively part of the product.\n\nThe ejabberd XMPP server has a bridge that enables federation with OCS servers, without gateways (transports).\n\nCompetitors to Lync Server include:\n\nIn instant messaging, the free public instant messaging networks (Google, Live Messenger, Yahoo and AOL) are widely used and represent a degree of competition. There have been attempts by other vendors at providing solutions such as Yahoo!'s Enterprise Instant Messenger; however these attempts have been largely unsuccessful. An ICQ corporate client and server option once existed, but it is no longer supported or developed.\n\nProducts such as Cisco Unified Presence Server (Version 6.0.2+) support federation with Microsoft Office Communication Server 2007 to provide presence of Cisco IP phones and remote call control of the IP phone from the Microsoft Office Communicator client.\n\nThe Siemens OpenScape solution offers a federation with the Office communicator, and also an integration into the office communicator, allowing to use the standard functionalities of the office communication suite together with the SIP based voice functionalities of the Siemens platform.\n\nThe Asterisk telephone platform supports SIP, IAX, and ISDN connections. Most telephones that support these protocols may be used with Asterisk, including software phone clients.\n\n\n"}

As of 2011, the population of the town is 11,400, while the municipality has 20,319 inhabitants.\n\nHistorically, the town by its modern name was first mentioned in texts from 1530 by Benedict Kuripešić. Following the revolutions of Serbia and the last Turks out of the town in 1877, it soon started to grow and develop in the hands of the independent nation of Serbia. Today, it is an industrial town with beautiful nature and plenty of wildlife.\n\nDuring World War I, 2,000–3,000 men were massacred by Bulgarian forces in the town from 1916 to 1917.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Surdulica was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. After World War II, Surdulica gradually industrialized, with one of the largest employers in the town being Zastava Pes, a supplier to Zastava's automotive wing which at one point employed up to 500 people. With the introduction of sanctions against Yugoslavia during the 1990s, Zastava Pes reduced its workforce by 70% and had its international contracts terminated.\n\nOver the course of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Surdulica was subject to NATO bombings on multiple occasions. By the end of the bombing campaign, approximately fifty homes were destroyed and around 600 more were damaged in Surdulica alone. On April 27, 1999, NATO missiles struck several houses in the southern town of Surdulica. A CNN journalist named Alessio Vinci subsequently visited the local morgue, where he reported 16 civilians killed as a result of the attack. One of Serbia's public broadcasters, RTS, reported that 20 civilians were killed during the April 27 bombings, whereas Human Rights Watch only recorded eleven deaths. Many of the victims had been killed in a single house on Zmaj Jova street, owned by Vojislav Milić. Milić's family and several neighbors took refuge in Milić's basement when his house was struck by two bombs, after which nine people were killed in his house alone.\n\nOver the night of May 30–31, 1999, NATO airstrikes destroyed a sanatorium and a retirement home in Surdulica. Human Rights Watch published the names of the 23 civilians killed in the sanatorium.\n\nThe town stands at 480 m above sea level; it is surrounded by mountains to the north by Čemernik and to the south by Vardenik; the highest peak Strešer stands at 1875 meters high. Some twenty kilometres along the river Vrla and up the mountains there is a highland called Vlasina. In the 1950s, a man made dam created a lake called Vlasinsko Jezero (Vlasina Lake) which is famous for its peat floating islands which were harvested by local farmers. The highland of Vlasina is unique natural reserve with rich wildlife in particular the many rare species of migrating birds that use this unique place as a stop on their migrating way north or south. The lake is rich with fish and is one of largest reservoirs of clean water in that part of the country. The surrounding soil is lush and green resembling the Devon Downs or Argentine pampas. It presents great potential for cattle breeding and dairy production. It has distinct four seasons with long snowy winters and brief hot summers. \nThere are also two streams running from the mountains and joining at the town of Surdulica. This is where the Romanovce River joins the Vrla River on their way to South Morava and thence to the Danube and the Black Sea.\n\nAside from the town of Surdulica, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Surdulica has a population of 20,319 inhabitants.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality of Surdulica:\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\nThere are two primary schools in the town of Surdulica - \"Vuk Karadžić\" and \"Jovan Jovanović Zmaj\", and several schools in the villages around the town. There are three secondary schools: \"Svetozar Marković Gimnazija\" (Grammar School), \"Josif Pančić School of Agriculture\" and a technical college, \"Nikola Tesla\". In line with falling population in the municipality of Surdulica the number of high school students is also falling.\n\n\n\n"}

His ancestral surname was Ji (姬), and clan name Guo (國).\n\nA grandson of Duke Mu of Zheng, Zichan served as prime minister of Zheng from 544 BC until his death. Under Zichan, Zheng managed to expand its territory, a difficult task for a small state surrounded by several large states. Zichan reformed the government to emphasise the rule of law. As a philosopher, Zichan separated the domains of heaven and the human world, arguing against superstition and believing that humans should be grounded in reality.\n\nZichan was responsible for many reforms that strengthened the state of Zheng. A realist, Zichan was heavily involved in all aspects of the state, reforming agricultural and commercial laws, setting the borders, centralising the state, ensuring the hiring of capable ministers, and changing social norms. He prohibited the hanging and later deliver of pamphlets, but is also recorded as having prevented other ministers from executing a man for criticising the government, arguing that it was in the best interests of the state to listen to the opinions of the common people.\n\nZichan reformed the government to emphasize the rule of law. In 543 BC, he had the state's code of law cast in bronze ding, a first among the Zhou states. He also enacted harsh punishments for criminals. Because of his focus on laws, historians often classify him as a Legalist.\n\nThe Zuo Zhuan records that he drafted penal laws to protect private property.\n\nZichan was also highly skilled in state-to-state politics. When the State of Jin tried to interfere in Zheng's internal affairs after the death of a Zheng minister, Zichan was well aware of the danger, arguing that if Jin was allowed to determine the successor of the deceased minister in the state of Zheng, Zheng would then have lost its sovereignty to Jin. He then proceeded to convince Jin not to interfere in Zheng's internal politics.\n\n"}

His first widely available album, \"And the Stars Go With You\", was in memory of the astronauts lost in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The following album, \"Flightpath\", contains six songs that commemorate the pre-space-age test pilots of Edwards Air Force Base in the 1950s. Jonn is a pilot with advanced instrument and commercial ratings and flies for the Civil Air Patrol as a search-and-rescue pilot.\n\nSerrie's next album, \"Tingri\", was based on a remote village in Tibet. It was his way of infusing more spiritual and romantic emotion into his music. In so doing, he strayed a bit from his space music roots but without sacrificing his trademark sound. In 1992 and 1994, he made two albums in which he put his earlier planetarium work from the 1980s on CD, on \"Planetary Chronicles, Volume 1\" and \"Planetary Chronicles, Volume 2\". In between, in 1993 and 1995, Serrie composed his own musical science fiction story based on a fictional Century Princess in \"Midsummer Century\" and \"Ixlandia\". In 1993, he submitted a song from his planetarium collection called \"Soft Landing\" to a Various Artists album sponsored largely by Steve Roach, another prominent new age musician. This song is only available on this recording. In 1997, Serrie's first Christmas album \"Upon a Midnight Clear\" was released; he rearranged known and less-known Christmas songs from around the world in his unique style. Due to its popularity, Serrie released two more Christmas albums, \"Yuletides\" in 2001 and \"Merrily on High\" in 2004.\n\nIn 1998, Serrie collaborated with David Carradine on his tai chi video series and released a CD soundtrack based on the videos, called \"Dream Journeys\". Also in 1998, he took a trip to shamanic America, which resulted in his musical collaboration with several Native American elders on \"Spirit Keepers\".\n\nIn 1999, Serrie appeared as a special guest of honor at the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, which was held in Cape Canaveral. As the final act of the after-dinner entertainment, he played a specially composed song \"Out of the Blue\", which has not been officially released.\n\nThe year 2000 brought Serrie's \"best of\" space music compilation, \"Century Seasons\". On this album two new songs appeared, although \"Deep Mystery\" reappeared on \"Lumia Nights\" two years later in a slightly shorter version. The other bonus track, \"Andromeda Dream\", appeared on this album. In 2000 Serrie collaborated with flutist Gary Stroutsos on the Narada label, on an album called \"Hidden World\".\n\nSince 2000, several of Serrie's albums have appeared on independent labels. 2002 brought \"Lumia Nights\", a space romance release on Valley Entertainment, composed in the style of \"Ixlandia\" and \"Midsummer Century\". In 2003, he signed a contract with New World Music, a major label in England, which included the reissue of his earlier Miramar releases. 2003 also brought \"The Stargazer's Journey\" with liner notes from famed astronomer David H. Levy. This was a return to form in Serrie's more traditional space music style.\n\nSerrie took an interesting musical turn in 2005 with \"Epiphany, Meditations on Sacred Hymns\", featuring his arrangement of traditional hymns and psalms, which he dedicated to his grandmother, his primary childhood church organ and piano teacher. He followed this up in 2006 with \"Sunday Morning\", an independent release for autistic children and their parents. A portion of the profits from this CD goes to support for autism organizations in the United States.\n\nAlso in 2006, music from one of his albums was used in the hit Hollywood movie \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" Serrie scored the award-winning IMAX short film \" Hubble: Galaxies Across Space and Time\" as well as the popular astronomy software program Starry Nights and Space.com's \"Eyes on Mars\" DVD.\n\nIn 2009, Serrie released the album \"Thousand Star\".\n\nIn 2011 the album \"Sunday Morning\" was expected be released, available worldwide.\nIn 2014 the album \"Day Star\" was released available worldwide on New World Music\nIn 2017 the album \"The Sentinel\" was released available worldwide on New World Music\n\nJonn Serrie founded the Galaxy Music Scholarship in 2001, a US$1000 annual scholarship for graduating high school seniors desiring a career in new age and space music composition. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Family legend has it that he was related to the poet of the same name, but these stories are not proven.\n\nKörner attended the military school in Mährisch Weißkirchen (Hranice), the military academy, and became lieutenant in 1894. He served as an officer in Agram (today Zagreb, Croatia) and was promoted to major in 1904, in which year he became a member of the Austrian staff. During World War I, he was an active commander on the Italian front. He resigned from his military career in 1924 as a General.\n\nAlways interested in politics, he joined the social democrats and became a member of parliament in 1924. He served as Chairman of the Federal Council of Austria between December 1933 and February 1934.\n\nThe civil war in Austria and the installation of the austro-fascist dictatorship under Engelbert Dollfuss ended Körner's career as a politician. He was arrested, like other members of his party, by the authoritarian government that banned all opposition parties and put their representatives into prison. During World War II, Körner was again imprisoned, this time by the Nazis.\n\nAfter the war, in April 1945, Körner became Mayor of Vienna in the newly erected Second Republic. Körner was responsible for rebuilding and reconstructing Vienna, which was heavily destroyed due to the bombing during the war. After the death of Karl Renner, his party nominated Körner as candidate for the presidency, and Körner won the elections with slightly more than 51 percent of the votes. He therefore became the first President of Austria directly elected by the people. Körner died in Vienna, in office, the second consecutive President to do so.\n\nKörner had a profound knowledge of military sciences and wrote about military theory. In Vienna, there is a street named after him, as is the Theodor Körner Prize, an Austrian award for science and art.\n\nA motor vessel, the MS Theodor Körner was built in 1965 and currently operates on the Danube River as a \"Bike & Boat\" cruise ship, accommodating 135 passengers plus crew. \n\n\n\n"}

It is down the line from .\n\nThe LSWR opened its Exeter Extension from to Exeter Queen Street on 19 July 1860 but no station was provided at Pinhoe at that time. The village's station opened eleven years later on 30 October 1871. The original wooden footbridge was replaced by a concrete structure cast at nearby Exmouth Junction works, the first such footbridge erected by the Southern Railway, which had taken over from the LSWR in 1923.\n\nGoods facilities were provided from 3 April 1882, and in 1943 a government food cold store was built to the west of the station that was served by its own siding. The passenger station was closed by on 7 March 1966 when the Western Region of British Railways withdrew the local stopping services from the line. Goods facilities were withdrawn on 10 June 1967 and the cold store siding (now operated by a private company) closed in 1979.\n\nThe station was reopened by British Rail on 16 May 1983. Instead of a country village it was now on the eastern edge of the city. The initial trial period for commuter services proved successful and a regular service now operates all day, seven days a week. Between 2003 and 2008 passenger numbers increased by 530% and they are still increasing with an estimate of 94,354 users in 2015-16.\n\nThe station was built next to the level crossing of Pinn Lane. This was operated by the station staff until 1875 when a small signal box was brought into use; it was situated on the north side of the line to the east of the road. The initial 11 levers were extended to 17 in 1943 when the cold store was built. On 11 June 1967 one of the two tracks between Pinhoe and was taken out of use and trains towards London would often wait in the closed station for a westbound train to clear the single track section. The level crossing gates were replaced with lifting barriers on 17 March 1968. The signal box was finally closed on 13 February 1988, the level crossing and signals now being controlled from Exmouth Junction. The old signal box was dismantled and re-erected in the railway museum at on the Tamar Valley Line.\n\nThe station is just south of the village centre to the west of Station Road and access to the platforms is from this road; a footpath also links the eastbound platform with Main Road. A two-storey brick building between the road and the eastbound platform is the former station master's house. The main station building used to be next to this but was demolished after the station closed in the 1960s.

They issued a self-titled album that year and toured internationally in support of its release. Although they recorded material for a second album it was not issued and the group disbanded in 2007 with both Burns and James pursuing solo careers.\n\nBodyRockers formed in 2004 as an electronic music duo, consisting of Dylan Burns and Kaz James. Burns (ex-ColourSound), a British singer-guitarist from Canterbury, England, was visiting Melbourne, Australia when he was introduced to James by another DJ, Jason Herd. James had worked as a House music DJ in Australia and then \"played everywhere from Italy to Greece, Spain, Japan and Mykonos\". The pair first played together with Burns on guitar over James' rocky DJ set. Within a month of their first meeting, the duo created \"I Like the Way\", a song loosely based on Billy Idol's 1987 cover version of \"Mony Mony\" by Tommy James and the Shondells. Released as a single in April 2005, it reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart; No. 12 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart; and made the Top 20 on both the United States \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay Charts.\n\nThe success of \"I Like the Way\" allowed BodyRockers to tour internationally throughout 2005 and into 2006. In a 2007 interview, James described this era as \"amazing times! We toured the world with a band and sold a shit-load of records\". In late 2005, the group released a follow-up single, \"Round and Round\", which reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 40. Both songs appeared on their debut 2005 album, \"BodyRockers\". They recorded a second album, however the two mutually decided not to release it and instead to pursue their own career paths. As James stated, \"Since then we have moved on and actually made a second album but decided that we both wanted to go down different paths in our lives and going on the road as BodyRockers again for another three years promoting another album wasn't what we wanted\".\n\nThe song \"I Like the Way\" has been featured in advertisements for BMW, Citroen, Ford, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Diet Coke and Ethel Austin. It was used as promotional music for a 2005 Victoria's Secret fashion show as well as for the 2007 Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament.\n\nThe song \"Round and Round\" appears on the Bumpers and ID's of Canal 13 Argentina of 2013\n\nOther releases\n"}

It was designed to provide answers to questions beginning with the word \"How\". Each episode began with the presenters all raising one hand and saying \"How\" simultaneously (playing on the stereotypical Native American greeting). Common topics covered included science, history, mathematics, and simple puzzles. The series came to an end in 1981 when Southern Television lost its ITV franchise, but was revived as \"How 2\" in 1990 by TVS. In 2006 the final series was broadcast, having waited more than a year for transmission. The show was rebroadcast on STV in late 2009 as part of their weekend strand Wknd@stv broadcasting series 14 and 15. Repeats of the rebroadcasts on the weekend strand were also shown on the \nCITV Channel in October Half-Term 2009.\n\nA similar CITV show to appear a few years later was \"The Big Bang\", presented by \"How 2\"'s own Gareth Jones and Violet Berlin. \"The Big Bang\" had a more scientific slant, focusing on performing fun experiments involving simple physics and chemistry. Other similar British television series included \"Don't Ask Me\". Fred Dinenage was the only presenter to appear in both incarnations of \"How\", presenting the shows for a total of 31 years.

She was the first female member of the Parliament of South Australia, beating Joyce Steele, who had been elected to the House of Assembly the same day, by only an hour. She served until her retirement in 1979.\n\nJessie McAndrew was born and grew up in Sydney. She married Geoffrey D T Cooper, who was the youngest appointed Australian Lieutenant Colonel in World War II, commanding officer of the 2/27th, and a fourth generation member of the Adelaide Cooper family (Coopers Brewery). They had one son who qualified M.B.B.S. and Ph.D. and worked in immunology research before taking his father's seat on the Cooper's board of directors in 1989 and working as a general medical practitioner.\n\nIronically, South Australia was the last state to elect a female representative – at the 1896 election, South Australian women became the first in Australia, and some of the first in the world, to be given the right to vote and stand for election to Parliament. Cooper and Joyce Steele were elected to the Parliament of South Australia at the 1959 election.\n\nIn 1959, attempts were still being made to prevent women entering Parliament. In an action brought by Frank Chapman and Arthur Cockington, Jessie Cooper and Margaret Scott (the Liberal party and Labor party candidates respectively, running for the Legislative Council in the South Australian election), had to show that they were \"persons\" in the sense intended by the State Constitution to be eligible to stand. The South Australian Supreme Court found in their favour and Jessie Cooper went on to win a seat in the Legislative Council.\n\nReporters asked Joyce Steele and Jessie Cooper how they would combine their domestic duties with politics: Steele said that she would have to get a housekeeper to help with the housework, while Cooper replied that \"... she would fit in her housework in the same way as a male member fitted in the running of an orchard or an accountant's office.\" (Sydney Morning Herald, 9 March 1959. p. 1)\n\nMolly Byrne was Labor's first female elected to the Parliament of South Australia, at the 1965 election, and the third behind Steele and Cooper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1976870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976870", "title": "Shelbourne Road", "text": "Shelbourne Road\n\nShelbourne Road is a road in Ballsbridge, in the south east part of Dublin city. The area around it is known informally as \"Shelbourne.\"\n\nIn John Rocque's map of 1756, today's Shelbourne Road and Upper Grand Canal Street, from which it extends, appear together as Beggars' Bush Road. \"Wilson's Plan\" of 1793 shows that Beggars' Bush Road has become known as \"Artichoke Road\". Some sources attribute this change of name to John Villiboise, a French huguenot, who had obtained a ninety-year lease on 1 rood of land from Richard 5th Viscount Fitzwilliam in 1736 and who planted artichokes on the land adjoining his house. This house, located in the vicinity of today's Holles Street, became known as \"Artichoke House\" and eventually the road became known as Artichoke Road. In William Duncan's map of 1821, the district known as \"Beggars' Bush\" is a rather ill-defined area that seems to coincide more or less with the area of land now occupied by Lansdowne Road's rugby stadium and the houses to its west. Later ordnance survey maps give the precise size and boundaries for Beggars Bush: it is an area of 116 acres, 2 roods and 21 perches bounded on the east by the Dodder from the bridge at Ballsbridge to the bridge at Ringsend; on the north by Ringsend Road from Ringsend bridge to South Lotts Road; on the south-west by South Lotts Road to Beggars Bush Road (Shelbourne Road); from Shelbourne Road to Lansdowne Road; the boundary then runs south-west on Lansdowne Road alongside Trinity College's botanical gardens and turns south on Pembroke Road to join the bridge at Ballsbridge. Old street directories show that the name Artichoke Road was still in use in the 1860s, but that the numbering of houses ran in the opposite direction from that currently employed - for example, no.2 Artichoke Road corresponds to no.68 Shelbourne Road; no. 3 Artichoke Road corresponds to no. 66 Shelbourne Road.\n\nThe 1876 Ordnance Survey map refers to the road as \"Shelburne\" Road, a spelling that conforms to that of one of the titles of William Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marquess of Lansdowne, second Earl of Shelburne (family name Petty-FitzMaurice). Petty-Fitzmaurice, born in Dublin, was Prime Minister from 1782 to 1783. It is unclear how the spelling of today's Shelbourne Road acquired an \"o\"; Shelburne Falls in Massachusetts, also named in commemoration of William Petty-Fitzmaurice, has conserved the original spelling.\n\nShelbourne Road runs south-east from Haddington Road and skirts the site of the former Beggars Bush Barracks. It crosses Lansdowne Road just west of the famous international rugby union and football grounds. From there, it runs south-west to Merrion Road which it meets at the River Dodder bridge.\n\nEarly maps seem to indicate that the route of today's Shelbourne Road was determined by the borders of the marshy Dodder estuary which, also fed by the Swan River (now culverted), and subject to tidal flooding, extended almost as far west as the site of the Beggars' Bush Barracks. Although reclamation of the area can be said to have started with the construction of Sir John Rogerson's Quay in 1713, it wasn't until William Vavasour took a 150-year lease at £80 per annum on an area of sixty acres of marshland between Beggars' Bush and Ringsend in 1792 that the area began to take on the appearance we recognise today. According to The Dublin Chronicle, \"...This tract, which is every tide inundated by the tide and Dodder, the taker, it is said, intends immediately to reclaim by a complete double embankment of the Dodder, which, thus confined to a determined channel, will then form an handsome canal through it; a circumstance that will not only ornament an unsightly spot, but materially improve the salubrity of the air at Irishtown, Ring-send, &c”.\". Although further drainage works were undertaken in the 1830s to facilitate the construction of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway line, oyster and mussel shells frequently unearthed today during building and renovation works in houses along the road continue to provide reminders of the sea's recent presence.\n\nIn 1904, James Joyce rented the front upstairs room of No. 60 Shelbourne Road from a family called McKernan for a short period. It was from this house that, on 16 June 1904, he set out for a rendezvous with Nora Barnacle, later to be his wife. He commemorated this date by choosing it as the day on which the action of his novel, Ulysses, takes place. The 16 June is now frequently referred to as 'Bloomsday'.\n\nFarrington, the protagonist of Joyce's short story, \"Counterparts\", alighted from a tram \"at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body along in the shadows of the wall of the barracks\" as he made his way home, possibly to No. 60 Shelbourne Road.\n\nOn the site now occupied by the Berkeley Court and Jurys hotels stood Trinity College's Botanic Gardens. In 2005, this seven-acre plot of land was purchased for €379 million, making this corner of Shelbourne Road perhaps the most expensive real estate in Europe. Plans to re-develop it have faltered.\n\nRichard Turner, best known for the Curvilinear Range in the Irish National Botanic Gardens, built his foundry, Hammersmith Ironworks, in 1834 on a six-acre site at the southern end of Shelbourne Road, immediately adjacent to Trinity College's Botanic Gardens. Many sections of the railings of Trinity College were cast in this foundry.\n\nTurner built houses, known as Turner's Cottages, at the side of his ironworks for his employees. These two-storey buildings, which were opposite today's Ballsbridge Motors, comprised an outer terrace on Shelbourne Road with an arc of terraced houses directly behind that. At the time of the 1901 census, there were 24 buildings. By the time of the 1911 census, two more cottages had, apparently, been added. Collectively, they were nicknamed \"The Gut\", for reasons that are not exactly clear but probably because the inner part of the estate was built in an arc, resembling a human gut. They survived until the early 1970s.\n\nThe Swastika Laundry was a laundry founded in 1912, located on Shelbourne Road. They used electric vans, that were painted in red with a black swastika on a white background, to collect and deliver laundry to customers.\n\nThe use of Shelbourne Road and Lansdowne Road copies the name street crossings in Kenmare, County Kerry, the origin perhaps being that the Cromwellian army physician Sir William Petty also \"moonlighted\" as a part-time ordinance surveyor/cartographer.\n\nShelbourne Football Club, founded in 1895, was named as a result of the founders (who included James Rowan and 2 Wall brothers) tossed a coin under the Bath Avenue railway bridge to decide whether the name would be Bath FC or Shelbourne FC. The club originally played at St Marys Field close by, then at Shelbourne Park, and later moved to Ringsend(\"Pnuemonia Park\") still terraced in the middle of a housing estate, followed by a short stay at Harolds Cross. Shelbourne FC now play on the northside of the city at Tolka Park.\n"}

With this selection, after years of writing and composing songs for other artists, the duo earned mainstream success in their own right. In the United States, \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\" peaked at number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart. The song reached number 9 in the UK and was also a top ten Australian hit in April 1989. It was featured in the 1990 movie \"Three Men and a Little Lady\". Reportedly, the song was inspired by an actual falling star that Merrill and Rubicam had seen at one of Whitney Houston's concerts at the Greek Theatre. The duo submitted the song to Houston for consideration on her next album, but her producer at the time, Clive Davis, rejected it. The song was also recorded by Belinda Carlisle for her 1987 release \"Heaven on Earth\" at the insistence of her label. But Carlisle disliked the song, and she ultimately refused to include it on the album, though it has circulated in her trading circles for years on a disc of that album's outtakes.\n\nBoy Meets Girl's follow-up single \"Bring Down the Moon\" peaked at No. 49 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (and No. 28 Adult Contemporary). \"Reel Life\" contained both singles and spent several weeks at No. 50 in the United States and peaked at No. 74 in the United Kingdom.\n\nBoy Meets Girl's third album, \"New Dream\", was scheduled for release in 1990, but RCA Records shelved it during a label reorganization. It was finally released through the band's own website in 2004.\n\nIn the early 2000s decade, the couple, who had married during the 1980s, divorced, but continued their musical collaboration. In 2003, they released their fourth album, \"The Wonderground\", on their own label, and arranged for RCA Records to re-release their two RCA albums. Their debut album recorded for A&M Records was also re-released. In the works are new versions of the demonstration tapes they originally recorded for Whitney Houston. The various artists album \"Number One With a Bullet\" also contains their original demo tape for \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\".\n\nIn 2005, \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\" was involved in a \"sample battle\". Two electronic music groups, Cabin Crew and Sunset Strippers, wanted to sample the song and remix it. Sunset Strippers, from the UK, won the right for the samples from the band's record label, releasing \"Falling Stars\". However, Cabin Crew, from Australia, had met Boy Meets Girl, and vocalist George Merrill re-recorded the vocals for the remixed song, entitled \"Star To Fall\" or \"Star2Fall\". A year earlier, Scottish electronic musician Mylo had also used samples of the song, mixing it with Kim Carnes's cover of \"Bette Davis Eyes\", for his song entitled \"In My Arms\".\n\n\n"}

In 2005 their remix, \"Star2Fall\", of Boy Meets Girl's 1988 single, \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\", reached the top 5 of the mainstream charts in Finland, Scotland and United Kingdom.\n\nCabin Crew were formed in 2000 as Aviators, a club music duo, in Sydney by Ben Garden, a producer-engineer, and Rob Kittler ( RobKAY), a DJ-producer. The pair had met in a Canberra secondary school but attended different tertiary institutions. Garden had worked in Sydney on production and composition for TV shows since 1999. Kittler had performed in Sydney and Canberra clubs, alongside other DJs. One of their first singles was \"Poison to My Mind (I Keep Movin')\" (2002) by Aviators featuring Lady K, which was co-written by Garden and Kittler with Kachina Lewis ( Lady K).\n\nIn 2003 Gardner started working on sampling, \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\", a 1988 single by Boy Meets Girl. Kittler remembered, \"He just thought of the sample and started to play with it. We did the final mix of it in September '03, and that's pretty much the result of what people are hearing now.\" Despite difficulties in obtaining clearances for the sample, they heard that United Kingdom group, Sunset Strippers had also sampled the same song. Kittler continued, \"we'd been trying to get our version cleared since May '04, then Sunset's version popped up. We had the green light given to us by the publishing company but we never heard back from Sony, who happened to own the master.\"\n\nIn November 2004 Cabin Crew issued a single, \"Star to Fall\" (later known as \"Star2Fall\"), which debuted at No.  34 on the ARIA Club Tracks chart. SonyBMG did not clear the sample for international release by the Australian duo. Instead, the label used Sunset Strippers' version. However, when Boy Meets Girl's vocalist and song writer, George Merrill, heard Cabin Crew's remix of the track, he re-recorded the vocals for them, allowing their version to be released, as \"Star2Fall\", in late February 2005 via Vicious Vinyl. \"inthemix\" reporter observed, \"The first mix on the single is a full-on vocal assault; it's the 'Radio Mix'. It opens with a huge uplifting male echoed vocal, and a big bassline. The level of cheese here is 11/10; it's definitely cheesier than your average funky house number.\"\n\nIn Australia, Sunset Strippers' and Cabin Crew's singles almost simultaneously entered the ARIA Singles charts in March. \"Star2Fall\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Club Tracks and reached the top 30 on its mainstream singles chart. Tara Thomas of Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), explained how, \"both [groups] sampled the same original song at the same time, despite being on opposite sides of the world. Sony granted the Sunset Strippers the rights to the original and denied Cabin Crew. Then, totally out of the blue Boy Meets Girl re-recorded the vocal for Cabin Crew making it possible for our local boys to release the tune as 'Star2Fall'.\" In March 2005 the group were signed to Ministry of Sound for international releases. Christie Eliezer of \"Music & Media\" described how Vicious Vinyl had released, \"a press statement to counteract rumours about the track. It has no issues with uncleared samples, and has the blessing of the song's writers.\"\n\nOn 28 February 2008, Cabin Crew released \"Can't Stop It\" on CD-Maxi (CDS/CDM), 12\" Vinyl (EP), and digital formats under the Vicious Vinyl label. The Mind Electric mix appeared on the various artists album, \"Vicious Cuts Summer 2008\".\n\nNotes\n\n"}

They are Piedmontese, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnol and Ligurian. Although some publications define Venetian as part of the Italo-Dalmatian branch, both Ethnologue and Glottolog group it into the Gallo-Italic languages.\n\nThe Gallo-Italian languages have characteristics both of the Gallo-Romance languages to the northwest (including French and Occitan) and the Italo-Dalmatian languages to the south (including Italian). Examples of the former are the loss of all final vowels other than \"-a\"; the occurrence of lenition; the development of original to (and often later to ); and the development of front rounded vowels (e.g. the change of to ). Examples of the latter are the use of vowel changes to indicate plurals in place of ; the widespread occurrence of metaphony of stressed vowels, triggered by original final ; and the development in some areas of instead of as the result of palatalisation of original before \"e\" and \"i\".\n\nAs a result, there is some debate over the proper grouping of the Gallo-Italic languages. They are sometimes grouped with Gallo-Romance, but other linguists group them in Italo-Dalmatian.\n\nTraditionally spoken in Northern Italy, southern Switzerland, San Marino and Monaco, most Gallo-Italian languages have given way in everyday use to regional varieties of Standard Italian. The vast majority of current speakers are bilingual with Italian. These languages are still spoken by the Italian diaspora in countries with Italian immigrant communities. The variety of Ligurian spoken in Monaco is formalised as Monégasque (\"Munegascu\").\n\n\nThe Gallo-Italian languages differ somewhat in their phonology from one language to another, but the following are the most important characteristics, as contrasted with Standard Italian:\n\n\n\nVarieties of Gallo-Italian languages are also found in Sicily, corresponding with the central-eastern parts of the island that received large numbers of immigrants from Northern Italy, called Lombards, during the decades following the Norman conquest of Sicily (around 1080 to 1120). Given the time that has lapsed and the influence from the Sicilian language itself, these dialects are best generically described as Gallo-Italic. The major centres where these dialects can still be heard today include Piazza Armerina, Aidone, Sperlinga, San Fratello, Nicosia, and Novara di Sicilia. Northern Italian dialects did not survive in some towns in the province of Catania that developed large Lombard communities during this period, namely Randazzo, Paternò and Bronte. However, the Northern Italian influence in the local varieties of Sicilian are marked. In the case of San Fratello, some linguists have suggested that the dialect present today has Provençal as its basis, having been a fort manned by Provençal mercenaries in the early decades of the Norman conquest (bearing in mind that it took the Normans 30 years to conquer the whole of the island).\n\nOther dialects, attested from 13th and 14th century, are also found in Basilicata, more precisely in the province of Potenza (Tito, Picerno, Pignola and Vaglio Basilicata), Trecchina, Rivello, Nemoli and San Costantino.\n\n"}

He was the son of the owner of the estate, Krabbesholm Manor, located near Skive in Jutland. He showed early signs of artistic talent, and received training as a craft painter. In the spring of 1841 Niels Rademacher, a visiting landscape painter, encouraged the young artist and convinced his parents of their son's talent.\n\nLater that year he traveled to Copenhagen and began his art studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") in October 1841. In December 1841 he began private studies with painter Martinus Rørbye. These lessons continued until 1847.\n\nIn 1843 he began his studies at the academy freehand drawing school, and the following year at the academy plaster school. Home during the summer and holidays, he busied himself by filling sketchbooks with studies of the local landscape, costumes, and way of life. These formed a lifelong basis for his art. He also began collecting local folk costumes, another lifelong interest.\n\nIn 1844 Dalsgaard came under the influence of the art historian Niels Lauritz Høyen, who gave a famous lecture titled \"On the conditions for the development of a Scandinavian national art\" (\"\"Om betingelserne for en skandinavisk nationalkunsts udvikling\"\"). Høyen called for artists to search for subject matter in the folk life of their country instead of searching for themes in other lands, such as Italy (which was at that time considered a requirement for an artist's training). Dalsgaard was a loyal follower of Høyen's artistic ideals, and forwent the customary journey to Italy, choosing rather to concentrate on themes closer to home.\n\nIn March 1846 he began studying at the Academy's model school under professors Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, J. L. Lund and Martinus Rørbye. He had his exhibition debut at Charlottenborg in 1847 and continued showing there every year with few exceptions.\n\nIn 1855 he painted his first altarpiece at the church in his hometown of Skive. He went on to paint a number of other altarpieces in the years to come.\n\nHe had his big breakthrough in 1856 with the painting \"Mormoner på besøg hos en tømrer på landet\" (\"Mormons visit a country carpenter\"). The painting, created only six years after the missionaries' arrival in Denmark, is set in the shadowed interior of a provincial cottage. A group of people are gathered around a table, listening to a missionary's message. Light filters in through a small window and an open door. It is a study of contemporary daily life, carefully depicting the interior and costumes of the people in detail. The painting was donated to the Danish National Gallery (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\") in 1871.\n\nHe married Hansine Marie Hansen on 21 August 1857. The newlyweds purchased a house in Frederiksberg. Their circle of social acquaintances included Constantin Hansen, Niels Lauritz Høyen, Wilhelm Marstrand, P.C. Skovgaard, Vilhelm Kyhn, Godtfred Rump, Frederik Vermehren and Julius Exner.\n\nDalsgaard received the Academy's Neuhausen's prize (\"Neuhausens præmie\") in both 1859 and 1861. He began teaching drawing at Sorø Academy in 1862. Upon being selected, he became a member of the Academy of Art in 1872. He exhibited at the World Exhibition in Paris for the first time in 1878.\n\nHe painted his famous painting \"I wonder when he will come home\" (\"Mon han dog ikke skulle komme?\") in 1879. This painting is typical of his style. The picture features a young woman standing in an open doorway looking off to one side. One foot is on the door frame, and one foot is on the ground outside. The interior is dark and shadowed. The outside is a sunlit agrarian landscape. The title of the painting refers to her inner dialogue.\n\nIn 1890 he finished the first of twenty-one small Bible pictures, a project which he continued to work on for the next ten years. He was named a professor at the Academy of Art in 1892, and quit his position at Sorø Academy.\n\nHe died on 11 February 1907 in Sorø.\n\nIn 1914 the artist's widow contributed a portion of his collection of folk costumes to the National Museum. She died in Sorø on 3 November of that same year. The National Museum acquired the remainder of the collection in 1921.\n\nChristen Dalsgaard, like his contemporaries Julius Exner and Frederik Vermehren, painted primarily genre paintings, national romantic folk scenes rooted in the grasslands of Jutland. He paid great attention to details – folk costumes, the manners and habits of the people, and architecture and landscape. He was a storyteller. His artistic works, as well as those of his contemporaries, opened the way for more realistic paintings in the late 1800s. \n\nA collection of his work can be found at the Skive Art Museum. Other paintings can be found at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, among other museums.\n\n"}

In December 2009 Habitat was bought by Hilco, a restructuring specialist. On 24 June 2011 the company was put into liquidation and all but three UK Habitat stores were closed in a deal to sell the indebted furniture chain, with the brand and the three London stores sold to Home Retail Group. In September 2016, UK retailer Sainsbury's bought Home Retail Group, including Argos and Habitat, for £1.4 billion (about $1.85 billion).\n\nSir Terence Conran founded Habitat in London in 1964, opening his own store to market his Summa range of furniture. The first store was opened in Fulham Road in Chelsea by Conran, his then wife Caroline, Philip Pollock and the model Pagan Taylor. This store became the Habitat template, with its quarry tiled floor, whitewashed brick walls, white-painted wooden-slatted ceilings and spotlights creating a feeling of space and focusing attention on the product. Conran has said the main reason for the shop's initial success was that Habitat was one of the few places that sold cheap pasta storage jars just as the market for dried pasta took off in the UK.\n\nThe business expanded quickly in the UK throughout the 1960s and internationally with the first overseas store opening in 1973 in Paris. Habitat also published a catalogue that showed a range of products grouped together in pleasant surroundings.\n\nIn 1968 Habitat merged with the stationery retailer Ryman to form Ryman Conran. The following year it purchased the business of Lupton Morton, which mostly supplied furniture to offices and corporations but also made pieces by other designers, and in 1970 acquired the retail chain Straker-Bedser.\n\nBy 1970 the turnover of the group had doubled since the merger with Habitat. Terence Conran however was disappointed that Habitat itself had not been expanded and offered to purchase Habitat from Ryman Conran along with Conran Associates and the remains of Lupton Morton. Ryman Conran did not highly value the Habitat chain and apparently thought it was making a loss, so agreed to the sale. Ryman Conran retained Habitat's original factory in Thetford along with Conran Design Group.\n\nIn 1981, the company's shares were floated on the London Stock Exchange and in 1982 it merged with Mothercare Group to form Habitat Mothercare Group plc. The now-listed company bought the furniture retailer Heal's and the Richard Shops fashion chain in 1983. In 1986, the company merged with British Home Stores to form Storehouse plc.\n\nIn 1992 Habitat was purchased from Storehouse by Ikano. In October 2009, following several years of trading losses, the Kamprad family, which owns Ikano, put the company up for sale, and it was sold to Hilco, a restructuring specialist, in December 2009 with the Kamprad family writing off the debts of the company and providing €50 million (£45 million) of working capital while Hilco paid about €15m.\n\nOn 24 June 2011 Hilco, which had owned Habitat UK Ltd since December 2009, announced that it was putting the company into administration. Home Retail Group (owner of Argos and Homebase) purchased the Habitat brand, three central London stores and the UK website. The UK business was registered under the name Habitat Retail Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Home Retail Group. Home Retail Group retained about 100 staff at the London stores and around 50 in head office, including many of Habitat's in-house designers, buyers and merchandisers. Cafom, a company registered in France, purchased Habitat's European businesses. By 11 September 2011, all other Habitat stores in the UK had been closed by Hilco with around 750 employees being made redundant.\n\nThe Home Retail Group acquired the three London stores in Tottenham Court Road, King's Road and Finchley Road and the transactional website. It then introduced mini Habitat stores within Homebase branches nationwide, beginning with Ruislip in October 2012, followed by Solihull, Ewell, Battersea, Horsham, Orpington, Leeds, Bracknell and Truro. By the end of 2013 Habitat said there would be 14 mini Habitat stores across the UK. Habitat had also begun to offer a selection of Habitat products in 200 Homebase and Argos stores nationwide and on the Argos and Homebase websites.\n\nTo mark its 50th birthday in 2014, Habitat commissioned five past designers – Aaron Probyn, Simon Pengelly, Claire Norcross, Sarah Campbell & Shin Azumi – from its design studio to create a collection of celebratory products, as well as contemporary graphic artist James Joyce to create a one-off celebratory logo.\n\nIn April 2016, Home Retail Group agreed to a £1.4bn takeover by UK retailer Sainsbury's. The deal included the sale of brands Argos and Habitat. The acquisition completed on 2 September 2016. Before the acquisition Home Retail Group sold the Homebase brand to the Australian brand Wesfarmers and all Habitat branches within Homebase stores were subsequently closed.\n\nHabitat has been under the leadership of managing director Clare Askem since 2011 and the in-house London design studio has been led by creative director Polly Dickens since 2012.\n\nHabitat currently has 17 UK stores. Three London flagship stores – Tottenham Court Road, Finchley Road and Westfield White City (Opened 2018) – one flagship store in Brighton (opened November 2018) – one standalone store in Leeds and twelve smaller 'Mini Habitat' format branches located in either Argos or Sainsbury's stores.\n\nHabitat also has a transactional UK website, as well as offering a selection of Habitat products on the Argos website.\n\nThe Habitat store on King's Road in London closed in 2018. This was because the building it had occupied since 1973 is being redeveloped under plans submitted by the landowner Cadogan Estates and approved by the Kensington & Chelsea Council.\n\nIn April 2016 Habitat unveiled a £1.5million refurbishment of its flagship Tottenham Court Road store. Designed by the Habitat in-house Design Studio, the new store featured a completely new look and layout for the brand with a stripped back design and monochrome colour palette to highlight Habitat's bright product collections.\n\nIn 2018, the business opened two new standalone stores. One in Westfield White City as part of the extension of the shopping centre which was planned to attract more homeware and lifestyle brands. The other store was opened in Brighton, this was the location of one of Habitats most successful Homebase concessions.\n\nHabitat's registered office is at the Sainsbury's Argos offices in Milton Keynes, however the business is predominantly based out of Saffron House, Farringdon. The businesses home delivery operation is based from Argos' Acton Gate warehouse. The customer services department are based in the Sainsbury's Argos call centre at Widnes, Cheshire.\n\nHabitat is part of the Sainsbury's Group, specifically the Sainsbury's Argos business which runs all general merchandise and clothing operations for the Sainsbury's group, this includes Habitat, Argos, Sainsbury's Home products and TU Clothing. As a result of being part of this wider group customers can also purchase a wide range of Habitat products from Argos stores or online at Argos.co.uk or Argos.i.e. Larger Sainsbury's supermarkets also have Habitat homewares available among their normal Sainsbury's Home stock.\n\nIn January 2009, Habitat began planning a fully transactional web site to enter the online shopping market. The site was launched in November 2009, based on an E-commerce application from BT Expedite, with a back-end by LShift, after a period when only a small number of products were available online. Following feedback, the company announced a new website in January 2011, offering online delivery to UK, Germany and Republic of Ireland.\n\nUp to September 2016, Habitat's then parent company, Home Retail Group, operated 84 mini-Habitat concessions in Homebase stores. With the demerger of Homebase from Home Retail Group to the Australian retailer Wesfarmers, all mini-Habitat concessions were removed from Homebase.\n\nThe company used to have stores in Galway and Dublin in the Republic of Ireland but these were closed down in 2008. Habitat previously employed 1,574 staff and operated in 71 stores: 35 in the UK, 26 in France, five in Spain and five in Germany (as of October 2009). The international operations are now run by Groupe Habitat, part of Cafom since 2011.\n\nMay 2016 & April 2017: British fashion designer Henry Holland collaborates with UK design brand Habitat to launch his first interiors collection. Launching at Habitat's Tottenham Court Road flagship store in London, the capsule collection of limited edition designs features a series of prints taken from the SS16 House of Holland season translated across a range of textiles and upholstery. Following its success, a second collection was launched in April 2017.\n\nJune 2017: Supper club duo Laura Jackson and Alice Levine launch their debut homeware range with design brand Habitat. The capsule collection of hand-woven table and kitchen linens coincides with the launch of Jackson and Levine's first book – \"Round to Ours\" – and has been designed to reflect the pair's distinctive stylistic approach to their own East-End supper clubs. \n"}
{"id": "1976946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976946", "title": "Rapoport's rule", "text": "Rapoport's rule\n\nRapoport's rule is an ecogeographical rule that states that latitudinal ranges of plants and animals are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes.\n\nStevens (1989) named the rule after Eduardo H. Rapoport, who had earlier provided evidence for the phenomenon for subspecies of mammals (Rapoport 1975, 1982). Stevens used the rule to \"explain\" greater species diversity in the tropics in the sense that latitudinal gradients in species diversity and the rule have identical exceptional data and so must have the same underlying cause. Narrower ranges in the tropics would facilitate more species to coexist. He later extended the rule to altitudinal gradients, claiming that altitudinal ranges are greatest at greater altitudes (Stevens 1992), and to depth gradients in the oceans (Stevens 1996). The rule has been the focus of intense discussion and given much impetus to exploring distributional patterns of plants and animals. Stevens' original paper has been cited about 330 times in the scientific literature.\n\nSupport for the generality of the rule is at best equivocal. For example, marine teleost fishes have the greatest latitudinal ranges at low latitudes. In contrast, freshwater fishes do show the trend, although only above a latitude of about 40 degrees North. Some subsequent papers have found support for the rule, others, probably even more numerous, have found exceptions to it. For most groups that have been shown to follow the rule, it is restricted to or at least most distinct above latitudes of about 40–50 degrees. Rohde therefore concluded that the rule describes a local phenomenon. Computer simulations using the Chowdhury Ecosystem Model did not find support for the rule.\n\nRohde (1996) explained the fact that the rule is restricted to very high latitudes by effects of glaciations which have wiped out species with narrow ranges, a view also expressed by Brown (1995). Another explanation of Rapoport's rule is the \"climatic variability\" or \"seasonal variability hypothesis\". According to this hypothesis, seasonal variability selects for greater climatic tolerances and therefore wider latitudinal ranges (see also Fernandez and Vrba 2005).\n\nThe methods used to demonstrate the rule have been subject to some controversy. Most commonly, authors plot means of latitudinal ranges in a particular 5° latitudinal band against latitude, although modal or median ranges have been used by some. In the original paper by Stevens, all species occurring in each band were counted, i.e., a species with a range of 50 degrees occurs in 10 or 11 bands. However, this may lead to an artificial inflation of latitudinal ranges of species occurring at high latitudes, because even a few tropical species with wide ranges will affect the means of ranges at high latitudes, whereas the opposite effect due to high latitude species extending into the tropics is negligible: species diversity is much smaller at high than low latitudes. As an alternative method the \"midpoint method\" has been proposed, which avoids this problem. It counts only those species with the midpoint of their ranges in a particular latitudinal band. An additional complication in assessing Rapoport's rule for data based on field sampling is the possibility of a spurious pattern driven by a sample-size artifact. Equal sampling effort at species-rich and species-poor localities tends to underestimate range size at the richer localities relative to the poorer, when in fact range sizes might not differ among localities.\n\nMarine benthic invertebrates and some parasites have been shown to have smaller dispersal abilities in cold seas (Thorson's rule), which would counteract Rapoport's rule. The tropics have far more uniform temperatures over a far wider latitudinal range (about 45 degrees) than high latitude species. As temperature is one of the most important (if not the most important) factor determining geographical distribution, wider latitudinal ranges in the tropics might therefore be expected.\n\nThe inconsistent results concerning Rapoport's rule suggest that certain characteristics of species may be responsible for their different latitudinal ranges. These characteristics may include, for example, their evolutionary age: species that have evolved recently in the tropics may have small latitudinal ranges because they have not had the time to spread far from their origin, whereas older species have extended their ranges.\n\n\n"}

Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Gloucestershire in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\n1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\n1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n\n"}

The station is elevated on a low viaduct with entrances on Cowick Street. It is down the line from and measured from via .\n\nThe station is unstaffed with the former station building now used for a bar and nightclub. It is mainly served by local trains operated by Great Western Railway.\nIt is the only station in Exeter which is listed (Grade II).\n\nThe station was opened on 30 May 1846 by the South Devon Railway. The company had joint use of the Bristol and Exeter Railway station at St David's but St Thomas was its own station. Although built on a stone viaduct, the railway was nearer to the city centre and the quays on the Exeter Canal. Until 1862 tickets were only sold between St Thomas and stations west of Exeter, not to St David's and the north.\n\nThe railway was worked by atmospheric trains from 13 September 1847 until 9 September 1848. Unique in all the South Devon Railway stations, there was no engine house, so the driver had to hold the train on its brakes against the pressure in the pipes while it was stopped here.\n\nThe original station featured just a single track with a platform on the city side of the line. A small booking office was built at road level at the north end of the station and steps led up to the platform. The viaduct was widened at this point by five feet to accommodate the platform.\n\nIn 1847 some improvements were completed including a larger office, a train shed over the platform, and an extension to bring the platform to a length of 260 feet.\n\nIn 1851 George Hennet was given permission to build a coal depot at St Thomas from where he could distribute coal, brought by train from his quay at Teignmouth. This was built on the city side of the line, north of the station. Hennet died in 1857 and the depot was eventually taken over by Robert Ward. It was closed in 1884 but Ward continued to use the land as premises until c. 1930. The site is now occupied by the Great Western Railway Staff Association staff club.\n\nIn 1861 the viaduct was widened on the west side (away from the city), and a second track brought into use which necessitated a second platform be built. Elegant new two-storey buildings were built on the city side of the viaduct, and a new train shed built across both platforms.\n\nThe train shed was demolished in the 1960s and the station is now unstaffed. The 1861 building was previously used as a Chinese restaurant and a nightclub. Since 2015 the building stands derelict and has fallen into disrepair with the doors and windows boarded up.\n\nThe station was proposed for closure in Dr. Beeching's \"The Reshaping of Britain's Railways\" report but has remained open.\n\nMost trains are operated by Great Western Railway on the Riviera Line to and from which then generally continue east of to and from along the Avocet Line. A few other services operate to destinations further afield such as , and , with one direct service a day to and from London Paddington.\n\n"}

Steele was elected to the House of Assembly and Cooper was elected to the Legislative Council at the 1959 election. Ironically, while South Australian women had been given the right to vote and stand for election—a right they had gained at the 1896 election—South Australia had been the last state to elect a female representative.\n\nPrior to her election, Joyce Steele was a homemaker, an ABC broadcaster and active in community organisations, including the Queen Adelaide Club (the women's equivalent of the exclusive Adelaide Club). She was pre-selected for the Liberal and Country League's (LCL) safest metropolitan seat, Burnside, in 1959 and was comfortably elected. She was not a feminist, and was affiliated with the conservative wing of the LCL.\n\nMolly Byrne was Labor's first female elected to the Parliament of South Australia at the 1965 election, and the third ahead of Steele and Cooper.\n\nSteele was also the first South Australian woman to achieve Cabinet rank in the South Australian Parliament as Minister of Education in the Hall Government from 1968 to 1969. As South Australian schools were increasingly overcrowded due to the children of the baby boomers passing through, it was a tough portfolio, although moderate increases in education spending were allocated. She took the Social Welfare ministry for the remainder of the Hall government's term.\n\nAfter the government passed electoral reform legislation in 1968, Burnside was mostly replaced by the equally safe seat of Bragg. However, Steele did not contest this seat, instead transferring to the LCL's safest new seat, Davenport, which covered the south-east of the City of Burnside. She received 68% of the primary vote in the 1970 election. On 9 June 1973, Young Liberals State President and Liberal Movement member Dean Brown announced his intention to stand for Davenport pre-selection. Steele, in response, announced her retirement, but not without declaring that \"[Dean] certainly will not have my support. I think my attitude to the Liberal Movement is well known\".\n\n\n"}

For instance, an attack on Sigtuna by Baltic Vikings in 1187 led to a battle at Almarestäket, resulting in the death of Archbishop Johannes.\n\nThere was a fortress built here in the mid-late 14th century, under the reign of Albert of Sweden. It was located on the small island \"Stäkesön\" in the middle of the strait. It became the residence of the Swedish Archbishop until 1517, when the Archbishop Gustav Trolle locked himself in there to avoid trial, and the Swedish government demanded and carried out the demolition of the fortress. The procedure was formally unauthorized because at the time State property was to be separate from Church property. As a revenge for this and other perceived injustices, Trolle, assisted by the Danish King Christian II, took revenge in the Stockholm Bloodbath of 1520.\n\nThere was a trench dug here sometime in the 17th or early 18th century, as a defence structure.

{"id": "1976990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976990", "title": "Clustal", "text": "Clustal\n\nClustal is a series of widely used computer programs used in Bioinformatics for multiple sequence alignment. There have been many versions of Clustal over the development of the algorithm that are listed below. The analysis of each tool and its algorithm are also detailed in their respective categories. Available operating systems listed in the sidebar are a combination of the software availability and may not be supported for every current version of the Clustal tools. Clustal Omega has the widest variety of operating systems out of all the Clustal tools.\nThere have been many variations of the Clustal software, all of which are listed below:\n\n\nThe papers describing the clustal software have been very highly cited, with two of them amongst the most cited papers of all time.\n\nThe more recent version of the software available for Windows, Mac OS, and Unix/Linux. It is also commonly used via a web interface at its own home page or hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute.\n\nThe guide tree in the initial programs was constructed via a UPGMA \"clust\"er an\"al\"ysis of the pairwise alignments, hence the name CLUSTAL. The first four versions in 1988 had Arabic numerals (1 to 4), whereas with the fifth version Des Higgins switched to Roman numeral V in 1992. In 1994 and in 1997, for the next two versions, the letters after the letter V were used and made to correspond to W for Weighted and X for X Window. The name omega was chosen to mark a change from the previous ones.\n\nAll variations of the Clustal software align sequences using a heuristic that progressively builds a multiple sequence alignment from a series of pairwise alignments. This method works by analyzing the sequences as a whole, then utilizing the UPGMA/Neighbor-joining method to generate a distance matrix. A guide tree is then calculated from the scores of the sequences in the matrix, then subsequently used to build the multiple sequence alignment by progressively aligning the sequences in order of similarity. Essentially, Clustal creates multiple sequence alignments through three main steps:\n\nThese steps are carried out automatically when you select \"Do Complete Alignment\".\nOther options are \"Do Alignment from guide tree and phylogeny\" and \"Produce guide tree only\".\n\nThis program accepts a wide range of input formats, including NBRF/PIR, FASTA, EMBL/Swiss-Prot, Clustal, GCC/MSF, GCG9 RSF, and GDE.\n\nThe output format can be one or many of the following: Clustal, NBRF/PIR, GCG/MSF, PHYLIP, GDE, or NEXUS.\n\nThe same symbols are shown for both DNA/RNA alignments and protein alignments, so while * (asterisk) symbols are useful to both, the other consensus symbols should be ignored for DNA/RNA alignments.\n\nMany settings can be modified to adapt the alignment algorithm to different circumstances. The main parameters are the gap opening penalty, and the gap extension penalty.\n\nThe original program in the Clustal series of software was developed in 1988 as a way to generate multiple sequence alignments on personal computers. ClustalV was released 4 years later and greatly improved upon the original, adding and altering a few key features, including a switch to being written in C instead of Fortran like its predecessor.\n\nBoth versions use the same fast approximate algorithm to calculate the similarity scores between sequences, which in turn produces the pairwise alignments. The algorithm works by calculating the similarity scores as the number of k-tuple matches between two sequences, accounting for a set penalty for gaps. The more similar the sequences, the higher the score, the more divergent, the lower the scores. Once the sequences are scored, a dendrogram is generated through the UPGMA to represent the ordering of the multiple sequence alignment. The higher ordered sets of sequences are aligned first, followed by the rest in descending order. The algorithm allows for very large data sets, and works fast. However, the speed is dependent on the range for the k-tuple matches chosen for the particular sequence type.\n\nSome of the most notable additions in ClustalV are profile alignments, and full command line interface options. The ability to use profile alignments allows the user to align two or more previous alignments or sequences to a new alignment and move misaligned sequences (low scored) further down the alignment order. This gives the user the option to gradually and methodically create multiple sequence alignments with more control than the basic option. The option to run from the command line greatly expedites the multiple sequence alignment process. Sequences can be run with a simple command,\n\nand the program will determine what type of sequence it is analyzing. When the program is completed, the output of the multiple sequence alignment as well as the dendrogram go to files with .aln and .dnd extensions respectively. The command line interface uses the default parameters, and doesn't allow for other options.\n\nClustalW like the other Clustal tools is used for aligning multiple nucleotide or protein sequences in an efficient manner. It uses progressive alignment methods, which align the most similar sequences first and work their way down to the least similar sequences until a global alignment is created. ClustalW is a matrix-based algorithm, whereas tools like T-Coffee and Dialign are consistency-based. ClustalW has a fairly efficient algorithm that competes well against other software. This program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate a global alignment, for pairwise sequence alignment (2 sequences) use tools similar to EMBOSS, LALIGN.\nClustalW uses progressive alignment methods as stated above. In these, the sequences with the best alignment score are aligned first, then progressively more distant groups of sequences are aligned. This heuristic approach is necessary due to the time and memory demand of finding the global optimal solution. The first step to the algorithm is computing a rough distance matrix between each pair of sequences, also known as pairwise sequence alignment. The next step is a neighbor-joining method that uses midpoint rooting to create an overall guide tree. The process it uses to do this is shown in the detailed diagram for the method to the right. The guide tree is then used as a rough template to generate a global alignment.\n\nClustalW has a time complexity of formula_1 because of its use of the neighbor-joining method. In the updated version (ClustalW2) there is an option built into the software to use UPGMA which is faster with large input sizes. The command line flag in order to use it instead of neighbor-joining is:\n-clustering=UPGMA\nFor example, on a standard desktop, running UPGMA on 10,000 sequences would produce results in less than a minute while neighbor-joining would take over an hour. By running the ClustalW algorithm with this adjustment, it saves significant amounts of time.\n\nClustalW2 also has an option to use iterative alignment to increase alignment accuracy. While it is not necessarily faster or more efficient complexity-wise, the increase in accuracy is valuable and can be useful for smaller data sizes. These are the various command line flags to achieve this:\n-Iteration=Alignment\n-Iteration=Tree\n-numiters\n\nThe first command line option refines the final alignment. The second option incorporates the scheme into the progressive alignment step of the algorithm. The third specifies the number of iteration cycles where the default value is set to 3.\n\nThe algorithm ClustalW uses provides a close-to-optimal result almost every time. However, it does exceptionally well when the data set contains sequences with varied degrees of divergence. This is because in a data set like this, the guide tree becomes less sensitive to noise. ClustalW was one of the first algorithms to combine pairwise alignment and global alignment in an attempt to be speed efficient, and it worked, but there is a loss in accuracy that other software doesn't have due to this.\n\nClustalW, when compared to other MSA algorithms, performed as one of the quickest while still maintaining a level of accuracy. There is still much to be improved compared to its consistency-based competitors like T-Coffee. The accuracy for ClustalW when tested against MAFFT, T-Coffee, Clustal Omega, and other MSA implementations had the lowest accuracy for full-length sequences. It had the least RAM memory demanding algorithm out of all the ones tested in the study. While ClustalW recorded the lowest level of accuracy among its competitors, it still maintained what some would deem acceptable. There have been updates and improvements to the algorithm that are present in ClustalW2 that work to increase accuracy while still maintaining its greatly valued speed.\n\nClustalΩ (alternatively written as Clustal O and Clustal Omega) is a fast and scalable program written in C and C++ used for multiple sequence alignment. It uses seeded guide trees and a new HMM engine that focuses on two profiles to generate these alignments. The program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate the multiple sequence alignment, for two sequences use pairwise sequence alignment tools (EMBOSS, LALIGN). Clustal Omega is consistency-based and is widely viewed as one of the fastest online implementations of all multiple sequence alignment tools and still ranks high in accuracy, among both consistency-based and matrix-based algorithms.\n\nClustal Omega has five main steps in order to generate the multiple sequence alignment. The first is producing a pairwise alignment using the k-tuple method, also known as the word method. This, in summary, is a heuristic method that isn't guaranteed to find an optimal alignment solution, but is significantly more efficient than the dynamic programming method of alignment. After that, the sequences are clustered using the modified mBed method. The mBed method calculates pairwise distance using sequence embedding. This step is followed by the k-means clustering method. Next, the guide tree is constructed using the UPGMA method. This is shown as multiple guide tree steps leading into one final guide tree construction because of the way the UPGMA algorithm works. At each step, (each diamond in the flowchart) the nearest two clusters are combined and is repeated until the final tree can be assessed. In the final step, the multiple sequence alignment is produced using HHAlign package from the HH-Suite, which uses two profile HMM's. A profile HMM is a linear state machine consisting of a series of nodes, each of which corresponds roughly to a position (column) in the alignment from which it was built.\n\nThe exact way of computing an optimal alignment between \"N\" sequences has a computational complexity of formula_2 for \"N\" sequences of length \"L\" making it prohibitive for even small numbers of sequences. Clustal Omega uses a modified version of mBed which has a complexity of formula_3, and produces guide trees that are just as accurate as those from conventional methods. The speed and accuracy of the guide trees in Clustal Omega is attributed to the implementation of a modified mBed algorithm. It also reduces the computational time and memory requirements to complete alignments on large datasets.\n\nThe accuracy of Clustal Omega on a small number of sequences is, on average, very similar to what are considered high quality sequence aligners. The difference comes when using large sets of data with hundreds of thousands of sequences. In these cases, Clustal Omega outperforms other algorithms across the board. Its completion time and overall quality is consistently better than other programs. It is capable of running 100,000+ sequences on one processor in a few hours.\n\nClustal Omega uses the HHAlign package of the HH-Suite, which aligns two profile Hidden Markov Models instead of a profile-profile comparison. This improves the quality of the sensitivity and alignment significantly. This, combined with the mBed method, gives Clustal Omega its advantage over other sequence aligners. The results end up being very accurate and very quick which is the optimal situation.\n\nOn data sets with nonconserved terminal bases, Clustal Omega may be more accurate than Probcons and T-Coffee despite the fact that both of these are consistency-based algorithms, in contrast to Clustal Omega. On an efficiency test with programs that produce high accuracy scores, MAFFT was the fastest, closely followed by Clustal Omega. Both were faster than T-Coffee, however, MAFFT and Clustal Omega required more memory to run.\n\nClustal2 is the packaged release of both the command-line ClustalW and graphical Clustal X. Neither are new tools, but are updated and improved versions of the previous implementations seen above. Both downloads come precompiled for many operating systems like Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (both XP and Vista). This release was designed in order to make the website more organized and user friendly, as well as updating the source codes to their most recent versions. Clustal2 is version 2 of both ClustalW and ClustalX, which is where it gets its name. Past versions can still be found on the website, however, every precompilation is now up to date.\n\n"}

The Wildcats compete in the National Basketball League (NBL) and play their home games at RAC Arena, known colloquially as \"The Jungle\". Their sister team, the Perth Lynx, play in the Women's National Basketball League.\n\nAfter three years of strong lobbying to the NBL, the creation of a national basketball team in Perth finally occurred in 1982. The Westate Wildcats were established and played out of the 800-seat Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium. Interest in basketball steadily grew throughout the community and in 1984 the Westate Wildcats became the Perth Wildcats. The Wildcats have gone on to become the highest-drawing and most successful team in the league, having won NBL championships in 1990, 1991, 1995, 2000, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020, placing the team five ahead of Melbourne United, who has five championships. Since 1987, the Wildcats have made 34-straight post-season appearances, an accomplishment matched by no other professional sports team in Australia.\n\nThe Wildcats are the city's only major professional basketball team and are one of Western Australia's major summer sport teams, along with the Perth Scorchers (cricket, Big Bash League), the Western Warriors (cricket, Sheffield Shield) and Perth Glory (soccer, A-League). Wildcats players are active members of the Perth community, with the off-court structures aimed at making the players better people so that they could become better players cited as the biggest key to success. There are personal qualities demanded from owner Jack Bendat down through every rank of the organisation, and being a proactive part of community work, particularly through its InspiRED program, is pivotal. The public support for the Wildcats has been deemed remarkable, particularly the way fans have bought into the brand to create the \"Red Army\". The Wildcats' sturdy culture has long been built on a history of winning. In 2009, after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Jack Bendat and then-chief executive officer Nick Marvin transformed the franchise, focusing on being family-friendly and engaging with children in Western Australia. From a zero-tolerance swearing policy to always making eye contact and acknowledging supporters, players have a 350-hour community engagement obligation, 200 hours above what the collective bargaining agreement requires. In 2009, instead of doing 20 school visits per year, the Wildcats started doing 100. This increased to 200 school visits in 2010, and the year after it rose again to 220. Under Marvin, the philosophy was: the more engaged the Wildcats were with the West Australian community, the more fans they accumulated. As a result, they are the most successful franchise in NBL history and one of the most competitive professional sporting teams in the world, with crowds at Perth Arena the best and unmatched in the NBL.\n\nThe Wildcats have consistently enjoyed large home crowds since moving into Perth Arena in 2012, resulting in arguably the greatest home-court advantage in the NBL. In January 2017, the Wildcats became the first NBL franchise to break the 10,000-member barrier. As a result of their large fan base, known as the \"Red Army\", the Wildcats have set numerous record sell-out crowds at Perth Arena. A record crowd of 13,559 watched the Adelaide 36ers knock off the Wildcats 106–102 on 16 January 2015; that was later bested on 14 January 2017 when 13,611 people watched the Wildcats once again lose to the 36ers, this time by a margin of 95–84. A capacity crowd of 13,611 later attended Game 3 of the 2017 Grand Final series on 5 March 2017, matching the Wildcats' highest-attendance record. A capacity crowd of 13,611 attended the Wildcats vs Melbourne United match on 12 January 2018, marking the seventh time topping 13,000 at Perth Arena in 2017–18. The Wildcats went on to record the highest ever attendance for a team during an NBL season with 183,689 fans attending their home games during the 2017–18 regular season.\n\nSince 2012, the team has been forced on an extended road trip for much of December due to Perth's annual hosting of the Hopman Cup at Perth Arena in early January.\n\nWhen the Wildcats have won the NBL title, the team's victory celebration and ceremony has been held in the City of Perth at Forrest Place.\n\nIn 1979, the National Basketball League (NBL) in Australia was formed. It took another three years of lobbying by the Perth basketball community, led by personalities like Gordon Ellis, before a team in Western Australia became a reality. Formed in 1982 as the Westate Wildcats, the Wildcats became the first, and so far only, Western Australian team to compete in the NBL. The team was initially coached by Henry Daigle and captained by Mike Ellis, and they played out of Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium. They struggled to make an impact in their first season, finishing 10th with a 10–16 win/loss record.\n\nGordon Ellis took over as coach in 1983, but a 6–16 record ensued, with the Wildcats finishing well out of the finals race in 13th position. In 1984, the team was renamed the Perth Wildcats, but with coach Lynn Massey at the helm, the Wildcats finished on the bottom of the ladder (16th) with only three wins—an all-time low for the team.\n\nA fourth coach in Jay Brehmer came into the team for the 1985 season. Brehmer and imports Dan Clausen and Roland Brooks looked to lead the Wildcats to a finals berth for the first time, but they narrowly missed out on the post-season with a 13–13 record and an eighth-place finish. The Wildcats suffered a major setback in 1986 with the loss of the high-scoring Roland Brooks, after he suffered a season-ending injury just 10 games into the season. Without their star import, the Wildcats struggled to be competitive as they finished the season in 12th place with an 8–18 record.\n\nMany changes occurred in 1987. Most significantly, the team moved from the small confines of Perry Lakes Stadium to what was known in those days as the Perth Superdrome (now HBF Stadium). The Superdrome was capable of housing 5,000 people, compared to the 800-seat Perry Lakes Stadium. Also in 1987, still captained by Mike Ellis, the Perth Wildcats introduced players to the roster that would become household names such as Kendal Pinder, James Crawford, Cal Bruton (player/coach), Alan Black, Eric Watterson and Trevor Torrance.\n\nThe new talent paid off immediately for the Wildcats as the team made the finals for the first time. In the first two stages of the finals, the Wildcats defeated the Canberra Cannons and minor premier Adelaide 36ers to suddenly find themselves in the Grand Final series against the Brisbane Bullets. The Wildcats were repeatedly referred to as the 'Cinderella' story as they entered the season having finished in third-last position in 1986, only to go on to make the Grand Final after finishing the 1987 regular season in fourth position with a 19–7 record. The 'run, stun and have some fun' style of play that had been implemented that season had worked wonders until the Grand Final series. The series was a promoter's dream: East Coast versus West; solid fundamentals versus \"run and gun\"; future Hall of Fame members on both sides on the floor; and two coaches who couldn't stand each other (Brian Kerle versus Cal Bruton). The Bullets defeated the Wildcats by just one point in front of a sell-out Perth crowd in Game 1 of the three-match series, before claiming the Championship in Brisbane in Game 2 a few days later.\n\nAfter 1988 and 1989 both resulted in losses to the North Melbourne Giants in the Semi-finals, the most exciting chapter in Wildcats history came in 1990 as prominent West Australian businessman Kerry Stokes purchased the franchise and decided to raise the team's profile to incredible heights by moving the home court to the iconic 8,000-seat Perth Entertainment Centre.\n\nAfter retiring as a player following the 1989 season, Cal Bruton became the Wildcats' general manager in 1990. Eager for the team to win its first NBL Championship, Bruton embarked on an active recruiting campaign during the off-season; a recruiting campaign that saw the introduction of a player that is regularly referred to as the Wildcats' greatest: Ricky 'Amazing' Grace. Grace teamed-up with Mike Ellis to create a dominating backcourt. The 1990 season began with turmoil as coach Alan Black was controversially fired after only two games, and was replaced by Cal Bruton. Despite the shaky start to the season, the Wildcats recovered to finish in fifth place with a 17–9 record. Entering the finals as underdogs, the Wildcats swept the Melbourne Tigers in the Elimination Finals and got their revenge over the North Melbourne Giants with a 2–1 victory in the Semi-finals to again face the Brisbane Bullets in their second Grand Final appearance.\n\nTens of thousands of people across Western Australia tuned into the live coverage to watch the Wildcats triumph 112–106 in Game 1 of the Grand Final series in front of a sold-out Perth Entertainment Centre. Brisbane tied the series at 1–1 after winning Game 2 in convincing fashion at home, 106–90. In the deciding game also in Brisbane a few days later, the Wildcats blew the game wide open in the third quarter and were up by 20 points before the final term. They cruised to a 109–86 victory to claim their first NBL Championship. For his superb series, Grace was recognised as grand final MVP. Over the three games, Grace averaged 24.7 points per game.\n\nIn controversial circumstances, Cal Bruton was not retained as coach despite leading the Wildcats to a championship in 1990. He was replaced by Murray Arnold, a former assistant coach with the Chicago Bulls. Arnold's style of game was focused on defence which was a significant change from the high scoring and entertaining style previously implemented under Bruton. In pursuit of back-to-back championships, the Wildcats strengthened their roster considerably in the off-season with the addition of future WA basketball legend Andrew Vlahov and Peter Hansen, an American who arrived via Venezuela, Spain and the Perry Lakes Hawks.\n\nArnold's Wildcats were a highly successful team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi-finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had a unique opportunity to win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point in the history of the NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.\n\nJust as Mike Ellis had hoped, he and the likes of Pinder, Crawford, Grace and Vlahov found themselves in the midst of a Perth Wildcats dynasty.\n\nAfter a down year in 1992 produced a quarter-final loss, three major personnel changes occurred heading into the 1993 season. Club legend and captain Mike Ellis retired after 12 seasons, Dr Adrian Hurley was appointed as the new head coach replacing Murray Arnold, and finally the Wildcats enticed two-time league MVP Scott Fisher to the team.\n\nWith new captain Andrew Vlahov at the helm, the Wildcats continued their on-court success to finish as minor premiers and make it through to another Grand Final series, this time against a Melbourne Tigers team led by Andrew Gaze, Lanard Copeland and Mark Bradtke. The impending series is often described as the best Grand Final series in the history of the NBL. After splitting the first two games of the series, the championship came down to the final few seconds of Game 3 when Vlahov missed a three-point shot to tie the game with only seconds remaining. Despite being on the losing team, Ricky Grace was named the MVP of the series after averaging 22.3 points per game over the three games.\n\nFollowing a disappointing 1994 season, the Wildcats looked to recruit a pure sharp shooter to stretch opposing defenses and free up more room in the low post for the likes of Scott Fisher, James Crawford and Andrew Vlahov to operate in. Anthony Stewart was signed from the Hobart Tassie Devils to fill this role. Joining Stewart in the backcourt was Ricky Grace and Aaron Trahair, while Martin Cattalini rounded out the eight-man rotation used by coach Adrian Hurley.\n\nThe Wildcats were highly successful in 1995, as coach Hurley guided the team to what was referred to as the 'Triple Crown'—winning the pre-season competition, finishing minor premiers and then winning the NBL Championship. After defeating the Melbourne Tigers in the quarter-finals and the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats won through to their fifth Grand Final in nine years. In a rollercoaster Grand Final series against the North Melbourne Giants, both teams won away contests to be level coming into the deciding Game 3. The Wildcats went on to overpower the Giants in Game 3 and recorded a comfortable 108–88 victory in claiming their third NBL title. Captain Andrew Vlahov was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 24 points per game over the three games.\n\nThe Wildcats' championship win booked themselves a trip to London to play in the McDonald's Championship, an international tournament featuring the best clubs in the world. The Wildcats lost to the Houston Rockets 116–72 in their first game of the tournament, but managed to defeat Real Madrid 93–86 in their second game.\n\nFollowing four straight injury-plagued seasons that all resulted in early finals exists, the Wildcats geared up for a big season in 1999/2000 behind stalwarts Andrew Vlahov, Ricky Grace, Scott Fisher and Anthony Stewart, as well as the up-and-coming James Harvey and two-year centre Paul Rogers. In a boost for the Wildcats mid-season, the team signed import Marcus Timmons for their run to the finals.\n\nPrior to the season, Perth Wildcats owner Kerry Stokes decided to pass on the reins of the franchise to basketball great Luc Longley, fresh off being a three-time NBA championship winner with the Chicago Bulls, and Andrew Vlahov. The new ownership duo proved to be an instant success with the Wildcats securing an unprecedented fourth championship, defeating the Victoria Titans in front of a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the Perth Entertainment Centre. The Wildcats swept the Grand Final series 2–0, winning Game 1 in Melbourne 84–78 before returning home to clinch the series with an 83–76 Game 2 win. After scoring a game-high 27 points in Game 2, Marcus Timmons was named MVP of the series. To top off the season, Paul Rogers became the first Wildcat to be honoured as the regular-season MVP.\n\nIn 2002, club legend and captain Andrew Vlahov retired after 12 seasons, leaving Ricky Grace as the only remaining Wildcat from the team's halcyon days of the early to mid 1990s. Following the closure of the Perth Entertainment Centre, the Wildcats moved back in to their old home, the Superdrome (now HBF Stadium), for the 2002/03 season. The Perth Entertainment Centre was a popular venue for the Wildcats thanks to its central CBD location. The Superdrome, or Challenge Stadium as it became known, was a suburban-based arena and could only hold 5,000 compared to the 8,000-seat Perth Entertainment Centre.\n\nFollowing Vlahov's retirement, Grace became captain of the Wildcats for the 2002/03 season. Behind Grace and coach Alan Black, the Wildcats finished second on the ladder with a 22–8 record and advanced through to their seventh Grand Final series where they faced the Sydney Kings. In the championship series, the Wildcats were outclassed by the Kings, as they lost Game 1 in Sydney 98–94 before returning home and losing 117–101 in Game 2. In addition to Grace, Alan Black's son, Stephen Black, was also an important member of the Wildcats' 2003 grand final team, as was Tony Ronaldson, Rob Feaster, Matthew Burston, Brett Wheeler and James Harvey.\n\nIn the days following their grand final loss to the Kings, the Wildcats decided not to renew Black's contract and parted ways with him for a second time—he was sensationally sacked in 1990 after just one season as coach before being brought back in 1998 to replace the outgoing Adrian Hurley; Black led the team for six straight seasons and claimed one championship. Club legend Mike Ellis was appointed head coach for the 2003/04 season, but in his lone season as coach of the Wildcats, Ellis guided the team to their first losing season since 1986, as they finished in seventh spot with a 15–18 record and earned a quarter-final defeat. Ellis was replaced for the 2004/05 season by another former player, Scott Fisher. In addition, co-owner Luc Longley relinquished his majority share of the Wildcats in April 2004, leaving Andrew Vlahov as the sole owner of the franchise. The 2004/05 season saw the end of an era as captain Ricky Grace played his last game of his career with the Wildcats on 24 February 2005. Grace retired as a four-time NBL champion and a 15-year member of the Wildcats.\n\nWith Grace retired, the 2005/06 season saw veteran player Tony Ronaldson become captain of the Wildcats, while future club legend Shawn Redhage joined the team after a failed stint with the New Zealand Breakers in 2004. In his first season as a Wildcat, Redhage averaged a team-best 20 points per game and led the Wildcats to an unlikely Semi-final appearance, where they were defeated by the eventual champion Melbourne Tigers. Redhage's excellent debut season earned him runner-up in the MVP voting. During the 2005/06 season, in February 2006, West Australian businessman Jack Bendat became the chairman and majority shareholder of the franchise. Although no longer the majority shareholder, Andrew Vlahov remained in control of the team as managing director.\n\nIn August 2006, Paul Rogers became the fifth player to captain the Wildcats. Rogers replaced Tony Ronaldson as captain for the 2006/07 season, despite Ronaldson continuing to play for the team. The Wildcats celebrated their 25th anniversary during the 2006/07 season and recorded their highest number of wins in a single season (23 wins), although historically they have recorded better win-loss ratios. Their season came to an end after being defeated by the Cairns Taipans 82–78 in the quarter-finals. For the second year in a row, Redhage led the Wildcats in scoring with 21.4 points per game.\n\nThe 2007/08 season saw the Wildcats return to the Semi-finals under coach Scott Fisher and captain Paul Rogers, but they again fell short of reaching the Grand Final, losing the best-of-three Semi-final series 2–1 to the Sydney Kings. On the season, Redhage averaged a career-best 22.9 points per game and set his career high for points in a game with 40 on 10 October 2007 against the Adelaide 36ers.\n\nFollowing the 2007/08 season, head coach Scott Fisher departed the Wildcats in order to return to the United States for personal reasons, and was eventually replaced by his assistant, Connor Henry. Another Quarter Final exist ensued for the Wildcats in 2008/09, leading to Henry's tenure lasting only one season.\n\nOver his first four seasons at the Wildcats, Redhage averaged at least 19 points and eight rebounds every year while earning a place in the All-NBL Team in four straight seasons. He was also a four-time Gordon Ellis Medalist during this time for being the Wildcats Club MVP and was donned the nickname of 'The Scoring Machine' due to his scoring prowess as a force on the interior.\n\nFollowing the 2008/09 season, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised a million dollars in sponsorship. The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the time that there would be no league in 2009/10. Collaborating with other clubs, the Wildcats helped reform the league. Of all the teams in the NBL, the Wildcats underwent the greatest transformation. Under the guidance of managing director Nick Marvin, the club slashed $1.5 million worth of staff and hired a new coach, Rob Beveridge. The Wildcats also partnered with the WA Government to promote its 'Alcohol: Think again' initiative. Meanwhile, the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step with the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.\n\nBeveridge was instrumental in compiling a new-look team where Shawn Redhage, Stephen Weigh and Brad Robbins were surrounded by proven NBL players Damian Martin, Drew Williamson, Luke Schenscher and Martin Cattalini, and rising stars Kevin Lisch and Jesse Wagstaff. Paul Rogers relinquished the captaincy heading into the 2009/10 season, handing over the reins to Redhage. The mix turned out to work remarkably well, with the mid-season addition of Galen Young to replace the injured Paul Rogers proving the masterstroke that brought about a championship in the first year the group was together. After claiming the minor premiership and beating the Gold Coast Blaze in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats came up against the Wollongong Hawks in their first Grand Final series since 2003. After Games 1 and 2 proved to be comfortable victories for each home team, the Wildcats found themselves down by as many as 11 points in the second quarter of Game 3, before Lisch exploded offensively to finish with 29 points in lifting the team to a record fifth NBL Championship with a 96–72 win. Lisch was subsequently named MVP of the series.\n\nFollowing what was a season crippled by serious injuries to Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Shawn Redhage in 2010/11, the Wildcats looked to get back on top in 2011/12 with the addition of 7'2\" centre Luke Nevill. In a pleasing move, Redhage returned to action in 2011/12 after it was initially feared he'd possibly never play again following his injury in 2010/11. Perth had its heart and soul torn out in January 2011 when, for the first time in his career, co-captain Shawn Redhage was injured. The six-time club MVP lunged for a contested ball in a way that punched the head of his femur through his pelvis, breaking the bone and dislocating the joint.\n\nThe 2011/12 season saw the Wildcats jostle over top spot for the majority of the season with the New Zealand Breakers. The two teams went on to meet in the Grand Final, where the Breakers defeated the Wildcats in three games. Game 2 of the series saw Redhage force a third and deciding game with a final-second block on Breakers star C. J. Bruton. In his third season in Perth, Lisch took home the Andrew Gaze Trophy as the league's MVP, making him just the second Wildcat to achieve the honour.\n\nIn late 2012, the state-of-the-art Perth Arena was finally completed, with the 13 and half thousand seat stadium becoming the brand new home of the Wildcats starting with the 2012/13 season. However, injuries and retirements threatened to destabilise the season. With an injury to Matthew Knight early in the season, Michael Dunigan was brought in as a short-term replacement. Dunigan quickly became a fan-favourite with an array of blocks and crowd-pleasing dunks. Co-captain Brad Robbins abruptly retired just eight games into the season, sighting he had lost motivation and passion for the game, while Cameron Tovey announced in March that the 2012/13 season would be his last in the NBL. Despite the turmoil, the Wildcats finished second in 2012/13 and made their way through to yet another Grand Final series, where they had a re-match against the New Zealand Breakers. However, the Wildcats were dealt a major blow when Damian Martin was ruled out of the grand final series with an Achilles injury. Brad Robbins was subsequently rushed back into the team to take Martin's place, but without their floor general and defensive specialist, the Wildcats were dealt a 2–0 sweep from a Breakers side that won their third consecutive championship in 2013.\n\nAfter falling at the final hurdle two years in a row, the Wildcats went about developing a new look squad and style that would seriously challenge for a sixth NBL title in 2013/14. The 2013 off-season saw the departure of Rob Beveridge (coach), Kevin Lisch (shooting guard) and Cameron Tovey (small forward). As a result, the Wildcats appointed Trevor Gleeson as head coach, and signed two new imports in small forward James Ennis and shooting guard Jermaine Beal. The trio joined the team with the core group of players—new captain Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire—still intact. Further additions to Gleeson's new squad included centre Tom Jervis and guards Drake U'u and Erik Burdon.\n\nJames Ennis was a prized recruit for the Wildcats and his agreement with the team was well documented, with the Miami Heat holding his draft rights and being able to recall him at any time. He opened the season with a 25-point effort against the Adelaide 36ers—the most points scored by a Wildcat on debut at the time. Ennis helped the new-look Wildcats dominate the NBL with an 8–0 start to the season, a start which ultimately culminated in a 21–7 overall record and a minor premiership. His high-flying dunks and athleticism enthralled the entire league, as he proved to be a top MVP candidate alongside Melbourne Tigers guard Chris Goulding and the eventual winner, Rotnei Clarke of the Wollongong Hawks.\nThe Wildcats cruised to their 11th Grand Final appearance with a 2–0 Semi-final series win over the Wollongong Hawks. After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final. After winning Game 1 in Perth on the back of a 30-point effort from Ennis, the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. In Game 3 less than 48 hours later, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship. Beal was subsequently named the series MVP after Ennis struggled to make an impact in Games 2 and 3. Beal averaged 17.6 points per game during the Grand Final series, hitting 11 three-pointers at an efficient 48%.\n\nAfter an injury-riddled season in 2014/15 saw the Wildcats earn a Semi-final defeat—much like in 2010/11—coach Trevor Gleeson was confident heading into the 2015/16 season that he had assembled the right blend of players, after conceding his side struggled with chemistry issues in 2014/15. A banged-up Perth was swept out of the playoffs in 2015 following a fourth-place finish which marked an underwhelming follow-up to its title-winning campaign in 2014. Gleeson made a conscious effort during the 2015 off-season to make sure that first and foremost, the chemistry is right. Following a large player turnover, the Wildcats were confident high-profile recruits Casey Prather and Nate Jawai – as well as back-up guard Jarrod Kenny – would be strong fits among the group dynamic.\n\nThe Wildcats were relatively injury-free in 2015/16 and finished the regular season in second place with an 18–10 record. By qualifying for the finals in 2016, the Wildcats set a record with their 30th straight season of playing finals basketball. With Jawai's presence inside, Prather's athleticism, tough defence and ability to finish at the rim and Kenny being able support captain Damian Martin admirably, they provided improvement in crucial areas. Alongside the core of Martin, Redhage, Wagstaff, Knight, Hire, Beal and Jervis, the Wildcats were successful in reaching the Grand Final, where they defeated the New Zealand Breakers in three games led by captain and Grand Final MVP Damian Martin.\n\nThe 2016 off-season saw a lot of change in personnel, with three key players from the 2015/16 championship team moving on—Nate Jawai, Tom Jervis and Jermaine Beal. To replace them, coach Trevor Gleeson brought in Angus Brandt, Jameel McKay and Jaron Johnson, and headed into the 2016/17 season attempting to secure the team's first back-to-back championships since 1991.\nThe Wildcats started the season off strong with a 4–1 record, but things went south quickly after that. The Wildcats slumped to last spot in December with a 7–9 record as the team's injury toll started to bite—long-term injuries to Martin, Jarrod Kenny and Matthew Knight hurt the Wildcats. Their recruiting was also put under the spotlight when they axed import Jaron Johnson in December for a second time. Johnson was first axed just three games into the season in order to bring in three-point specialist Andre Ingram. But when Ingram returned home after just a few days, citing mental issues, Johnson was reinstated. Johnson was then shown the door again in December as the Wildcats turned their attention to a new point guard. The Wildcats were under siege when they slumped to the bottom of the ladder at Christmas. They then travelled to Wollongong for a must-win game against Illawarra on New Year's Eve without injured captain Damian Martin or a third import (after sacking Johnson). Amid the turmoil and against the odds, the Wildcats beat the Hawks, signed Bryce Cotton and their season changed. Behind the import duo of Casey Prather and Bryce Cotton, the Wildcats won eight of their remaining twelve regular season games, including two must-win encounters in the final week to squeeze into the finals. From there, the Wildcats rolled through the Finals undefeated to claim the title, an incredible achievement in what was arguably the closest season in NBL history. Not only did Perth extend their finals streak into a record 31st straight season, but their 3–0 Grand Final sweep of the Illawarra Hawks saw them claim their eighth NBL Championship. The Wildcats went back-to-back for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to back-to-back championships. In addition, series MVP Byrce Cotton placed his name in the NBL record books with a Grand Final performance that was arguably the greatest in the league's history. Cotton's Game 3 performance was unprecedented—he scored 45 points, the most ever scored in an NBL Grand Final game, breaking a 29-year-old record. His 27.7 points per game over the Grand Final series marked the most from any player in 20 years.\n\nThe season was made all the more special following Shawn Redhage's announcement that the 2016/17 season would be his last in the NBL. When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals for the first time in 31 years seemed like a real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name—380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)—while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.\n\nThe Wildcats reacquired the services of Grand Final MVP Bryce Cotton for the 2017/18 season, but lost two-time Club MVP Casey Prather to Melbourne United. The team's initial replacement for Prather was Devondrick Walker, but after Walker sustained a foot injury in August, the Wildcats replaced him with J. P. Tokoto. Other changes to the roster included Derek Cooke Jr. coming in to replace the outgoing Jameel McKay, and Lucas Walker stepping up from a training player role to a full-time squad member in place of the retired Shawn Redhage. The rest of the local contingent remained the same, including Matt Knight, who announced that the 2017–18 season would be his last. However, following three early-season head knocks, Knight brought forth his retirement in early November to join Redhage in retirement.\n\nThe Wildcats started the season with a 10–3 record, before dropping to 13–9 in mid-January. They finished the regular season in third place with a 16–12 record. On the eve of their finals campaign, Cotton was named league MVP, becoming just the third Wildcat to win the award after Paul Rogers (2000) and Kevin Lisch (2012). In addition, Cotton earned All-NBL First Team honours, Tokoto earned All-NBL Second Team honours, and Martin was named the NBL's Best Defensive Player—earning the honour for a record-breaking sixth time. In Game 1 of their semi-finals series against the second-seeded Adelaide 36ers, the Wildcats were defeated 109–74, thus recording their second biggest finals loss in club history. The only time the Wildcats have lost by a larger margin in their 32-year finals streak was in 1989 when they lost to North Melbourne by 55 points. The Wildcats went on to lose 89–88 to the 36ers in Game 2 to bow out of the finals.\n\nThe 2018 off-season saw the Wildcats secure Bryce Cotton to a three-year deal, while acquiring the services of Nick Kay and Mitch Norton from the Illawarra Hawks. While losing championship trio Lucas Walker, Jarrod Kenny and Dexter Kernich-Drew to the Cairns Taipans, former two-time championship Wildcat Tom Jervis returned to Perth after spending the previous two seasons with the Brisbane Bullets. They also signed import Terrico White and elevated four-year development player Rhys Vague to the full-time roster. The team travelled to the United States for two pre-season games against NBA teams Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets. where they were handed a 130–72 loss to the Jazz in their first match. This loss was cited by coach Trevor Gleeson as the catalyst to the season's success. The Wildcats started the season with a 10–1 record despite Martin, Brandt, White and Cotton being out for various periods of time with injuries. By mid-January however, the Wildcats had fallen to 12–9 after losing eight out of 10 games, leading to increasing external pressure urging them to make changes to their roster and bring in a third import. The organisation and coaches instead backed the playing group to return to form and enjoy success in the latter part of the season. In response, the team bounced back with three straight wins over Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney, seeing them move to 15–9 and atop the ladder by late January. They won the next three as well, and despite a regular-season finale loss to Melbourne and being without Norton since 25 January with a calf injury, the Wildcats finished as minor premiers with an 18–10 record. They went on to defeat the Bullets 2–0 in the semi-finals to advance through to their 14th NBL Grand Final series, where behind Grand Final MVP Terrico White, the Wildcats defeated Melbourne United 3–1 to claim their ninth NBL championship, hoisting the trophy on the back of 11 wins from their final 13 games. Having only secured the title interstate once before—in 1990—the Wildcats' win in Melbourne was only the fourth grand final road win for any NBL team since 2009.\n\nThe first move of the 2019 off-season was the re-signing of four-time championship-winning coach Trevor Gleeson, who was retained by the Wildcats on a three-year deal. Next saw the re-signing of five-time championship-winning duo Damian Martin and Jesse Wagstaff, which was followed by the retention of six others from the championship-winning roster, including the return of import Terrico White. Wagstaff took on the role of vice captain for the 2019–20 season following the retirement of Greg Hire, who was replaced on the roster by Wani Swaka Lo Buluk, who was elevated to the full-time squad after spending the 2018–19 season as a development player. To replace the outgoing Angus Brandt and Tom Jervis, the Wildcats signed two new centres in import Dario Hunt and West Australian Majok Majok. The team also had a change in both assistant coaching positions with Paul Woolpert and Jacob Chance replacing the outgoing Matthew Nielsen and Adam Forde.\n\nDuring pre-season, the Wildcats lost Swaka Lo Buluk to an ankle injury that saw him miss the first 17 games of the season. He was temporarily replaced in the squad by development player Nic Pozoglou. Early in the season, assistant coach Paul Woolpert, who had previously served under Gleeson during the 2014–15 season, was forced to return to the United States due to personal issues, which led to former NBA player and long-time coach Scott Roth stepping in to fill the void of lead assistant.\n\nThe team started the season with a 5–1 record, before slipping to 8–5 by the end of round 10 following back-to-back losses. Their losses over their first 13 games included a 23-point margin against the Cairns Taipans and a 19-point margin against the Sydney Kings. This culminated in a 99–88 loss to the Adelaide 36ers at home in round 10, with the game being over when the visitors led by 27 points during the third quarter. This loss followed a dramatic drop off in the final quarter against Cairns in round nine when Perth gave up a 12-point lead to lose by seven points. The team responded with four straight wins and closed out December with a 13–6 record. However, they lost Martin for the entire month of January after he suffered a left heel injury in the final game of 2019. After losing back-to-back games to start January 2020, Gleeson and the Wildcats decided to release Dario Hunt and replace him with seven-year NBA veteran Miles Plumlee. With seven games remaining in the season, Plumlee had to play all seven games to qualify for the finals. Due to the demanding schedule, the Wildcats had played 12 of their first 21 games away from Perth. Plumlee's debut game also came on the road, before the team closed out the season with five of their final six games being at home. Following the addition of Plumlee, the Wildcats won six of seven games to secure a 34th consecutive finals appearance with a second-place finish and a 19–9 record.\n\nIn the semi-finals, the Wildcats defeated the Cairns Taipans 2–1 to advance through to their 15th NBL Grand Final. In the grand final series, the Wildcats took Game 1 in Sydney before the Kings levelled the series with a win in Perth. The Wildcats went on to take a 2–1 series lead with a win in Game 3 in Sydney. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, it was decided that Games 2–5 would take place behind closed doors. Following Game 3 however, the Kings refused to take part in the final two games of the series, withdrawing citing health and safety concerns. As a result of a series cancellation and with Perth up 2–1, the NBL declared the Wildcats the champions for the 2019–20 season, thus claiming their 10th NBL championship. After averaging 30.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 4.7 assists over the three games, Cotton was named Grand Final MVP for the second time in four years, becoming the first player in Wildcats history to be named league MVP, Grand Final MVP and win a championship all in the same season.\n\nSource: Perth Wildcats Year by Year\n\nAfter three years of finals action that included a losing grand final series in 1987, the team won back-to-back titles in 1990 and 1991 behind the likes of Ricky Grace, James Crawford and Mike Ellis, and coaches Cal Bruton and Murray Arnold. It took four more years for the team's third NBL title in 1995, with coach Adrian Hurley and captain Andrew Vlahov leading the way. Five more years elapsed before the next championship came in the 1999/2000 season. Behind coach Alan Black and centre Paul Rogers, and veterans Vlahov, Grace and Scott Fisher still around, the Wildcats won their fourth title.\n\nA large championship drought occurred between 2000/01 and 2008/09, but the Wildcats still made the finals each season. Then in 2009/10, the Wildcats became the undisputed greatest NBL franchise with a fifth championship. Coach Rob Beveridge and import Kevin Lisch were instrumental to the team's success that season, as was Shawn Redhage and Damian Martin.\n\nTheir sixth championship came in 2013/14 thanks to coach Trevor Gleeson and imports Jermaine Beal and James Ennis. In 2014/15, the Wildcats qualified for the finals for a 29th straight year, a streak not matched by any Australian or American professional sports team other than the NHL's Boston Bruins. Their seventh championship came the next season in 2015/16, as coach Gleeson became the first Wildcats coach to win multiple championships. With their eighth title coming in 2016/17, the Wildcats won back-to-back championships for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to consecutive championships. In 2017, four-time championship-winning trio Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage and Jesse Wagstaff equaled Ricky Grace's franchise record of winning four championships. In 2019, Martin and Wagstaff became the only players in NBL history to win five championships at the one club. Martin and Wagstaff picked up their sixth championship rings in 2020, joining C. J. Bruton and David Stiff as the NBL's only six-time champions and the only players to be able to do that at one club. Additionally, Gleeson attained his fifth NBL championship, making him the second-most successful coach in league history behind six-time winner Brian Goorjian.\n\nThe Perth Wildcats' run of 34 straight NBL finals appearances since 1987 is unmatched in major Australian professional sports. The most consecutive finals reached in VFL/AFL football is 14 by the Hawthorn Football Club between 1982 and 1994, while the NRL's St. George Illawarra Dragons made 23 consecutive finals appearances between 1951 and 1973.\n\nIt is matched in the major North American sports only by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, which qualified for the playoffs for 34 consecutive years between 1972 and 2005. In American sport, the Philadelphia 76ers (as the Syracuse Nationals) made the NBA playoffs 22 straight seasons between 1949/50 and 1970/71, marking the best streak in the world's premier basketball league. In Major League Baseball, the best streak is held by the Atlanta Braves, who made 14 straight playoff appearances between 1992 and 2005. The only major professional team in the United States that had a record close to the Wildcats' 34 was the NHL's Boston Bruins, who made 29 consecutive playoff appearances between 1967/68 and 1995/96.\n\nThe Wildcats' 34 still trails Israeli professional basketball club Maccabi Tel Aviv's world record of 38 straight post-season appearances, with their 38th appearance coming in 2018/19.\n\n\n<section begin=roster />\n\n<section end=roster />\n\nNotes:\n\nOn 4 February 2013, the Perth Wildcats announced their best team from the first three decades of the franchise at their 30th anniversary breakfast. The team was picked by 1995 championship coach Adrian Hurley, \"The West Australian\"s online sports editor Ross Lewis, and long-time basketball broadcaster John Gardiner.\n\nSource: Perth Wildcats Achievements\n\n"}
{"id": "1976997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976997", "title": "Anglo-Irish trade war", "text": "Anglo-Irish trade war\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Trade War (also called the Economic War) was a retaliatory trade war between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom from 1932 to 1938. The Irish Government refused to continue reimbursing Britain with land annuities from financial loans granted to Irish tenant farmers to enable them to purchase lands under the Irish Land Acts in the late nineteenth century, a provision which had been part of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. This resulted in the imposition of unilateral trade restrictions by both countries, causing severe damage to the Irish economy.\n\nThe \"war\" had two main aspects:\n\nOn taking over power and coming into office in 1932, the new Fianna Fáil government under Éamon de Valera embarked upon a protectionist policy in economic dealings, and tariffs were introduced for a wide range of imported goods, mainly from Britain, the Free State's largest trading partner by far. This was thought necessary to develop native industry, move away from over-dependence on Britain, as well as its failure to develop industrially under free market conditions. It was also to compensate for the drastic fall in demand for Irish agricultural products on international markets, due to the Great Depression which had begun in 1929. Other means had also to be found to help the disastrously undermined balance of trade and the mounting national debt. A vigorous campaign was set in motion to make the Free State agriculturally and industrially self-sufficient by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass. Every effort was taken to add to the measures brought in by the previous government to boost tillage farming and industry and to encourage the population to avoid British imports and \"Buy Irish Goods\".\n\nThe government sought to go further and end the repayment to Britain of land annuities. These originated from the government loans granted to Irish tenant farmers by the Land Commission from the 1880s, which had enabled them to purchase lands from their former landlords, under the Irish Land Acts. In 1923, the previous W. T. Cosgrave government had assured Britain that the Free State would honour its debts and hand over the land annuities and other financial liabilities. Under the 1925 \"London Agreement\", the Free State was relieved from its treaty obligation to pay its share towards the public debt of the United Kingdom. The Free State's liability to supervise and pass on land annuities payments led to controversy and debate on whether they were private or public debts. In 1932, de Valera interpreted that the annuities were part of the public debt from which the Free State had been exempted, and decided that the Free State would no longer pay them to Britain. His government passed the Land Act of 1933 that allowed the money to be spent on local government projects.\n\nAfter a series of high-level talks in 1932, discussions broke down in October 1932 on whether the liability to pay the land annuities should be adjudicated by a panel chosen from experts from the British Empire (the British suggestion), or from the whole world (the Irish view). In counterclaim, De Valera required the British to:\n\nTo recover the annuities, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald retaliated with the imposition of 20% import duty on Free State agricultural products into the UK, which constituted 90% of all Free State exports. UK households were unwilling to pay twenty per cent extra for these food products. The Free State responded in kind by placing a similar duty on British imports and in the case of coal from the UK, with the remarkable slogan (from Jonathan Swift in the 1720s): \"Burn everything English except their coal\". While the UK was much less affected by the ensuing Economic War, the Irish economy was badly affected.\n\nInternally, the Irish Government did not actually end its own collection of annuities that were costing its farmers over £4 million annually. In the background, unemployment was extremely high, the effects of the Great Depression compounded the difficulties, removing the outlet of emigration and reducing remittances from abroad. The government urged people to support the confrontation with Britain as a national hardship to be shared by every citizen. Farmers were urged to turn to tillage to produce enough food for the home market.\n\nThe hardship of the Economic War, which impacted particularly on farmers, was enormous and exacerbated class tensions in the rural Free State. In 1935, a \"Coal-Cattle pact\" eased the situation somewhat, whereby Britain agreed to increase its import of Irish cattle by a third in return for the Free State importing more of Britain's coal. As the cattle industry remained in dire straits, the government purchased most of the surplus beef for which it paid bounties for each calf slaughtered as they could not be exported. It introduced a 'free beef for the poor' scheme, the hides finding use only in the tanning and leather industries. For many farmers, especially the larger cattle breeders, the agricultural depression had disastrous consequences. Similar to the \"Land War\" of the previous century, they refused to pay property rates or pay their land annuities. To recover payments due, the government counteracted by impounding livestock which were quickly auctioned off for less than their value. Farmers campaigned to have these sales boycotted, and blocked roads and railways. Police were called in to protect buyers of the impounded goods and some people were killed by the so-called \"Broy Harriers\". The government's senators would not attend a September 1934 Senate debate on the outcome of such a fracas in Cork.\n\nWith farmers having little money to spend, there was a considerable decline in the demand for manufactured goods, so that industries were also affected. The introduction of new import tariffs helped some Irish industries to expand when Lemass introduced the Control of Manufactures Act, whereby the majority ownership of Free State companies was to be limited to Irish citizens. This caused dozens of larger Irish companies with foreign investors, such as Guinness, to relocate their headquarters abroad and pay their corporate taxes there. Additional sugar beet factories were opened at Mallow, Tuam and Thurles. The Economic War did not seriously affect the balance of trade between the two countries because imports from Britain were restricted, but British exporters were very critical of their government due to the loss of business they also suffered in Ireland, by having to pay tariffs on goods they exported there. Both the pressure they exerted on the British government and the discontent of Irish farmers with the Fianna Fáil government helped to encourage both sides to seek settlement of the economic dispute.\n\nRemarkably, despite the general hardship the government vote held up in 1932–38. Firstly de Valera had called the 1933 election within a year of taking office, before the worst effects had been felt. The July 1937 election saw a drop in support for him, but also for his main rival, the Fine Gael party, and he continued in office with the tacit support of the Labour Party. The number of Dáil seats contested in 1937 had been reduced from 153 to 138 seats, leaving less chance for smaller parties to win seats.\n\nOn the same day as the 1937 election the Constitution of Ireland was adopted by a plebiscite, moving the State further away from the constitutional position envisaged by the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. The new Constitution was approved by 56.5% of voters who, because of the high numbers abstaining or spoiling votes, comprised just 38.6% of the whole electorate.\n\nIn 1935 tensions began to ease off between Britain and Ireland. With the 20% tax duties on imports, coal and cattle were becoming increasingly harder to buy because of the prices. There was such a surplus of cattle in Ireland that farmers had to begin to slaughter their cattle, because they could not be sold to the British. Britain and Ireland then signed the Coal-Cattle pact which meant that buying these commodities would be cheaper and easier to get. The coal-cattle pact indicated a willingness to end the \"Economic War\".\n\nThe resolution of the crisis came after a series of talks in London between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and de Valera, who was accompanied by Lemass and James Ryan. An agreement to reach an acceptable settlement was drawn up in 1938, enacted in Britain as the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act. Under the terms of the three-year Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, all duties imposed during the previous five years were lifted.\n\nAlthough the period of the Economic War resulted in severe social suffering and heavy financial loss for Ireland, its outcome was publicised as favourable. Ireland was still entitled to impose tariffs on British imports to protect new Irish industries. The treaty also settled the potential £3million-per-annum land annuities liability by a one-off payment to Britain of £10 million, and a waiver by both sides of all similar claims and counter-claims. As it was known in the 1930s that the Land Annuities payments in Northern Ireland of some £650,000 p.a. were being retained by its government, and not passed on to London, it remains unclear why the Irish government did not mention this in the course of negotiations.\n\nIt also included the return to Ireland of the Treaty Ports which had been retained by Britain under a provision of the 1921 Treaty. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 the return of the ports allowed Ireland to remain neutral.\n\nProtectionism remained a key element of Irish economic policy into the 1950s, stifling trade and prolonging emigration. Its architect, Seán Lemass, is now best remembered for dismantling and reversing the policy from 1960, advised by T. K. Whitaker's 1958 report \"\"First Programme for Economic Expansion\"\". This then became an important part of Ireland's application for entry into the European Economic Community in 1961 and eventual accession in 1973. The Republic's population rose in the late 1960s for the first time since the Free State's formation in 1922.\n\n"}
{"id": "1977008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977008", "title": "Dedinje", "text": "Dedinje\n\nDedinje (; ) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Savski Venac. Dedinje is generally considered the wealthiest part of Belgrade, and is the site of numerous villas and mansions owned by the members of the city's plutocracy, as well as many diplomatic residences.\n\nDedinje is located on the eastern slopes of the hill of Topčidersko Brdo, 7-8 kilometers south of downtown Belgrade to which it is connected by the \"Kneza Miloša street\". It borders the neighborhoods of Senjak (west), Prokop and Mostar (north), Stadion and Diplomatska Kolonija (actually, Dedinje's sub-neighborhood; east), Banjica, Lisičji Potok and Topčider (south). It is well connected to the other parts of Belgrade by several boulevards (of \"Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević\", \"Vojvoda Putnik\") and broad streets (\"Teodora Drajzera\", \"Neznanog junaka\", etc.). Main street in the neighborhood itself is the \"Užička\" street.\n\nThe hilly section on which the Royal Compound is built is called \"Vezirovo Brdo\" (\"Vizier's Hill\").\n\nIn Ottoman period, the hill was a gathering place of the Dervishes. Before it was urbanized, the area of modern Dedinje was known for its vineyards, orchards and farms. The area was mentioned by the names \"Dedija\", \"Mala Dedija\", \"Dedina\", \"Dedino brdo\" (literally, old man's hill; Serbian \"deda\" means old man, grandfather). In Turkish census from 1560, one of the Belgrade's tekije was located there. Austrian army had a camp on Dedinje in 1789 and in their charts from the 18th century they called it \"Dedinberg\". Settlement began to grow after the World War I, intensifying with the building of the residencies of the Karađorđević royal family, from 1924 to 1936. Majority of residents were from the most affluent Belgrade families of industrials, bankers, merchants and politicians, who built summer-houses at first and later lavish villas. What is today considered as the best known parts of Dedinje, like \"Tolstojeva\" or \"Užička\" streets, were not originally part of the settlement, as it emerged more to the south\n\nDedinje became popular among Belgrade's rich even before World War II, when it was on the outskirts of the city (thus many military barracks intended to defend the city, which later spawned tens of kilometers further). Many beautiful mansions in green neighborhood have been built, but in 1945 when Communists took over, they declared almost all former residents a state enemies and forced them out of their houses, so the new Communist political and military elite moved in, Tito being among the first. It continued after the collapse of Communism in 1980s, when the nouveau riche politicians (like Slobodan Milošević), shady businessmen (like Karić family or Željko Mitrović) and criminals (like Željko Ražnatović Arkan) moved into the neighborhood and began expanding their villas and erecting high concrete walls. Most of such construction was illegal, often intruding on the property of Dedinje families that had been there for generations preceding the arrival of the nouveau riche/criminal class.\n\nIn 2019, Branislav Mitrović, architect and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, said that \"caricatural architecture, inept compilations and stylish nonsenses\" turned once respectable residential neighborhood of Dedinje, so as Senjak and Neimar, into chaos.\n\nApart from this, the neighborhood is a site of many embassies, diplomatic residences and some of Belgrade's most expensive restaurants and clubs. In 2013, it was announced that the villa “Crnogorka”, in Uzicka Street, was to be returned to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia. The villa was bought by her mother, Princess Olga, in 1940, and taken by the state in 1947. It is currently owned by the Serbian government and used as the official residence of the Ambassador of Montenegro.\n\nFrom June 1945 to December 1946, Dedinje was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade's Raion VII.\n\nDedinje belonged to the municipality of Topčidersko Brdo, which in 1957 merged with the municipality of Zapadni Vračar to create the municipality of Savski Venac. Dedinje (local communities of Dedinje and 4. Juli) had a population of 8,704 in 2002 and 8,440 in 2011.\n\n\n\nin the 2004 unsolved murders of two on-duty soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1977012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977012", "title": "Košutnjak", "text": "Košutnjak\n\nKošutnjak (, ) is a park-forest and urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is divided between in the municipalities of Čukarica (upper and central parts) and Rakovica (lower part). With the adjoining Topčider, it is colloquially styled \"Belgrade's oxygen factory\". The 1923 Belgrade's general plan, in which one of the main projects regarding the green areas was forestation of the area between Topčider and the city, envisioned a continuous green area Senjak-Topčidersko Brdo-Hajd Park-Topčider-Košutnjakm which was formed by the 1930s. This continual forested area makes the largest \"green massif\" in the immediate vicinity of Belgrade's urban tissue.\n\nThe name, \"košutnjak\", is derived from the medieval hunting forests of the Serbian nobility, meaning \"doe's breeder\". (In Serbian, košuta means \"doe\", \"hind\"), as does used to live freely in the park until the World War I. The name was mentioned for the first time in 1831.\n\nThe Košutnjak hill is high and the entire forest complex covers an area of .\n\nKošutanjak has a few geological natural monuments. They include several Cretaceous maritime ridges of \"Burdelj\", \"Tasin Majdan\" and \"Baremski\", on the location of the assassination of the prince Michael, and a geology profile where the mint is located today.\n\nKošutnjak is located 6 km southwest from the downtown Belgrade. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Topčider to the north and west, Kanarevo Brdo to the northwest, Rakovica and Skojevsko Naselje to the south, and Žarkovo (with its extensions of Cerak, Cerak II, Repište) and Banovo Brdo (with its extension of Sunčana Padina) to the east. Filmski Grad (to the southwest) and Golf Naselje (to the northwest) are sub-neighborhoods of Košutnjak.\n\nIn the 19th century, Košutnjak was a fenced hunting ground and royal excursion place for the members of the Obrenović dynasty. Engineer, urbanist and professor at the Belgrade Lyceum, , was given a task of arranging the forest. He also arranged the neighboring Topčider Park and its nursery garden, and avenues along city's main streets and squares. Until the World War I, the area was under quality oak forest. A document from 1849 says that there were 48 deers in Košutnjak, 13 bulls and 35 does. In 1884 the first railway in Serbia, which connected Belgrade and Niš, was constructed through the forest. In 1908 Belgian architect Alban Chambon drafted a new general urban plan (GUP) in 1908 which made Košutnjak a public park.\n\nKošutnjak gained a sort of historical notoriety as prince of Serbia, Mihailo Obrenović III and his cousin Anka Konstantinović were assassinated while walking in the park on , and when Ivan Stambolić, Slobodan Milošević's political opponent was abducted from the park on 25 August 2000 and later assassinated and buried at Fruška Gora. There are also remnants of the German cemetery and the monuments to the Serbian soldiers erected by their adversaries, German soldiers, in World War I.\n\nAfter the assassination of prince Mihailo, the Board for the erection of the monument was formed already on 14 June 1868 and decided to collect donations for the construction of both the memorial church in Košutnjak, at the assassination location, and a monumental sculpture in the city itself. Russian sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin drafted the design for the memorial church or chapel in Košutnjak. After the public display, the citizens apparently liked the design and approved the construction. Painter Stevan Todorović ordered the lithographs to be made in Vienna. However, the process of building the memorials dragged on, and in 1871 Mikeshin's propositions were rejected. Also in 1871, the government opted to build only the monument in the city, which resulted in the Prince Mihailo Monument at the modern Republic Square.\n\nIn 1903, former royal hunting ground was opened for public, making Košutanjak an excursion area of Belgrade. The first summer sanatorium for the city children in Serbia was opened in Košutnjak. In 1911, Ministry of Construction devised the plan for the cart and pedestrian roads grid, spreading from Topčider railway station to the wide meadow on one of Košutnjak's plateaus. On this location, Pionirski Grad is located today. The 1923 Belgrade's general plan envisioned forestation of Topčidersko Brdo and Senjak, formation of the new park and establishment of the continuous green area with the Topčider and Košutnjak. Project started in 1926 while the Hyde Park was finished in the 1930s.\n\nUntil World War II, the pheasants were abundant too and in this period Košutnjak was a healing destination for many city children. After 1945 city urbanists considered the way Topčider-Košutnjak complex has been handled was wrong, especially the expansion of the railway station into the marshalling yard and construction of Filmski Grad (both especially hurt Košutnjak's appeal), so the Belgrade's GUP in the 1950s projected the complete removal of the railway objects from the Topčider valley, but that was never executed.\n\nAfter World War II, before skiing facilities were built on the mountains further from Belgrade, the slopes of Banovo Brdo (so as of Kalemegdan, Banovo Brdo and Avala), were used by Belgraders for skiing.\n\nFrom June 1945 to December 1946, Košutnjak was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade’s Raion VII.\n\nIn the 1980s, Košutnjak hosted one of the most popular Belgrade's disco clubs, \"Panorama\".\n\nKošutnjak is home to many plant and animal species, some of which are under strict protection. There are 521 plant species, including lime tree, pedunculate oak, common hornbeam, Turkey oak, Hungarian oak, European yew, sweet chestnut, cherry laurel, hackberry and Turkish hazel. About 5% of the forest is inhabited by the conifers, mostly cedar, black pine and white pine. In 2015, an average age of the trees has been estimated to 60–70 years. Also in 2015, about of Košutnjak has been re-forested with 4,400 seedlings of the common ash and sycamore.\n\nAnimals inhabiting the forest are squirrels, hedgehogs, woodpeckers and bats.\n\nKoŠutnjak hosts an experimental apiary, named after the forest. In May 2020 it was estimated that more than 3,000 honey bee swarms are orphaned in Belgrade, roaming around the city, trying to nest in rain gutters, under the eaves or even in residential houses, so the project of the bee sanctuaries construction within the complex began.\n\nKošutnjak is one of the most popular recreational places in Belgrade. With , Sports Center Košutnjak is one of the largest and most diverse in the city (stadiums, pools, etc.), while the park also has an auto-camp, modern settlements of Filmski Grad and Pionirski Grad, big studios of the national broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia, many popular restaurants and arranged paths criss-crossing the forest. There are also jogging tracks and a ski run.\n\nIn the lower parts, Košutnjak and Topčider forests grew together, while in the upper parts they are divided by the river Topčiderska reka and a railway passing through the river's valley (both Košutnjak and Topčider have their own, separate train stations).\n\nNobelist author Ivo Andrić wrote: \"You just hang on to Topčider and Košutnjak...Topčider is my favorite place, where I ate bread and drank wine in the sweetest and calmest manner\". Andrić's longtme friend, painter , made two paintings of Košutnjak in 1943. One, titled \"Košutnjak, 1943\" just shows the nature and is today exhibited in the Memorial museum of Ivo Andrić. On the another one, \"In Košutnjak during the occupation\" she painted Andrić, (Andrić's future wife) and Nenad Jovanović. This painting is in the National Museum of Serbia.\n\nIn 2014, city government declared \"Košutnjak Forest\" as a protected area, or the nature monument. Protected locality covers an area of . Košutnjak is the natural reserve of pedunculate oak, common hornbeam and silver lime.\n\nHowever, in the late 2010s, state and government authorities began extensive construction works in the forest, cutting dozens of trees. Residents at first tried to remove the construction fencing, but later stormed the construction sites, following the skirmishes with the police, and halted the works temporarily including blocking of the unmarked trucks without license plates which transported cut wood. Protest marches were also organized, so as blocking of the local Čukarica Municipality Hall. Objections also include claims that many of the objects already exist in the vicinity and that there are better locations, adjoining the existing sports center, where the cutting of the trees wouldn't be necessary.\n\nOne site is chosen as the location for the expanded \"Košutnjak\" sports center, in the large part of the forest which has been groomed since the 1960s. Expansion includes tall martial arts hall, expansion of the \"Trim\" hotel, bungalows, additional 4 tennis courts, shooting range, indoor swimming pool, 207 parking spots and access streets. Government claims the project will cost €12 million, out of which €1,2 million is for the artificial climbing rock, which, due to the price, gained negative media prominence. Authorities also claimed that only 20 trees will be cut, but 100 new ones will be planted, however some 60 pine trees were cut. The complex should be finished in 2021.\n\nConcurrently, trees were cut on the opposite slope, between the ski run and the Topčider cemetery. After the residents occupied the area, city stated that they are replacing trees with the new and healthy ones. Cutting of the trees came as the continuation of the constant cutting of the trees in Belgrade, including the neighborhood of Ušće and the Kalemegdan Park. Goran Trivan, Minister of Environmental Protection, said that citizens are overdramatizing as the \"tree is a renewable resource\". As the cutting continued, and protests grew, it was discovered that the company officially entrusted with the cutting of the trees, belongs to one of the top city officials and member of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, chief city urbanist Marko Stojčić. His company was the only bidder. After this was made public, a 2017 document which confirmed this was swiftly removed from the site of the Institute for Sports, which is in charge of the project. It was also made public that the cut trees have been transported to the house of a local representative and member of the same party, who claimed that he \"paid for it\".\n\nStojčić originally disputed the 2017 document before later acknowledging its existence, but claimed that he was awarded the job already in 2014, refusing to provide any documentation. He claimed he held no office at the time, either in the city or the party, however in 2014 he was already member of the city’s Planning Commission and of the City Urban Council, so he basically awarded the job to himself. Stojčić added that he sees no issue here.\n\nIn February 2020, citizens again protested as they noticed continued massive tree cutting. State company \"Srbijašume\", which administers forests, claimed that this was planned and controlled cutting of the forest in the areas where trees reached 70 years of age. The affected territory covers and it was claimed that 5,400 new seedlings will be planted instead.\n\nIn 1922 company \"Čavlina and Sladoljev\" from Zagreb drafted the project of connecting two banks of the Sava river by the cable car. In 1928, building company \"Šumadija\" again proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \"air tram\" but this project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized. Engineer and CEO of the Yugoslav institute for urbanism and dwelling \"Juginus\", Mirko Radovanac, revived the idea in the 1990s. After conducting extensive surveys (traffic analysis, interviews with the commuters, climatic, geological, urban and other researches), \"Juginus\" presented the project in 1993. They proposed that the termini should be at the Sports Center Košutnjak and Block 44 in the neighborhood of Savski Blokovi in New Belgrade, across the Sava. Stops in between would include the major public transportation roundabout in Banovo Brdo, Makiš and Ada Ciganlija, five in total. They called it the \"ideal route\". The plan also included construction of commercial areas around the termini, which would cover and help with the profitability of the project.\n\nApart from being ecological and an attraction, it was estimated that it would shorten the trip for 45 minutes. City government included the project into the city's GUP, which envisioned the construction in phases, the first being a long section Block 44-Ada Ciganlija. It would lay on 8 steel pillars, above the ground and the trip would last for 3 minutes. The cabins were projected to receive not just the commuters, but also the bicycles, skateboards, sledges and skis, as the cableway was planned to work year-round. The complete facility would have 27 pillars; it would be long which would be travelled in 15 minutes by 2,000 commuters per hour. Despite the project being publicly revived by the mayors Dragan Đilas (2008–2013) and Siniša Mali (2013–2018), as of 2019 the project still hasn't started.\n\nNew building of the Faculty of forestry was built in 1956, right above Careva Ćuprija, where the northwest section of the vast wood of Košutnjak begins at an altitude of 110–125 meters. Professors and students began developing a dendrology collection in 1957, which grew into the Arboretum of the Faculty of Forestry, a specific botanical garden which was protected by the state in July 2011 as the natural monument. It is used as an open-air classroom, for the practical studies of the students but also by the scientist for their work. The arboretum has its nursery garden and the greenhouse. On 6.7 hecaters, the arboretum holds 2,000 individual specimen of 300 trees and shrubs. They include 218 deciduous and 24 conifer species, out of which 80 are ornamental, and 40 species of the perennial plants. There are 77 domestic and 146 foreign species, including: narrow-leafed ash, Balkan maple, Balkan forsythia, laburnum, giant sequoia, cedar, cherry laurel (new variety developed in arboretum), Himalayan pine and the oldest metasequoia in Belgrade.\n\n\"Hajdučka česma\" (Hajduks' drinking fountain) is a natural spring, which is one of the most prominent destinations for the picnickers, especially as the most popular location of the traditional \"Prvomajski uranak\" (\"Labour Day early outing\"), celebration of May 1, Labour Day, in Belgrade. On 28 August 1977 a spectacular concert of the rock group Bijelo Dugme was held. With an attendance of over 100,000, it is considered as one of the seminal events in the history of Yugoslav rock.\n\nAfter fierce fighting in the World War I, German occupation army conquered Belgrade in October 1915. German commander, \"Generalfeldmarschall\" August von Mackensen, order for the dead soldiers to be buried on the hill above Banovo Brdo. Amazed by the bravery of the Serbian soldiers who defended the city, Mackensen order for Serbian dead soldiers to be buried in the center of the cemetery: bodies of 36 Serbian soldiers from the 7th Infantry Regiment, one British and one French soldier were surrounded by the bodies of 2,600 German soldiers. This act surprised even Mackensen's subordinated officers. Above each grave there was a cross with information about the deceased, from their military papers. He also erected three monuments. Two were for the German soldiers while the third one, shaped like a simple stone block says in Serbian and German language: \"Here rest Serbian heroes, 1915\".\n\nWhen German emperor Wilhelm II arrived in Belgrade in 1916, a large stone bench was built for him by the German soldiers. So as the monument, it was made from the marble which Belgrade municipality purchased in 1911 and which was planned for the reconstruction of the central city square Terazije and the Terazije fountain. The bench was placed on the point on the hill from which the emperor could see the entire Belgrade below.\n\nBy the 21st century, the cemetery deteriorated a lot. One monument to the German soldiers is in bad shape and it is believed that the Serbian soldiers were transferred to the joint ossuary for the World War I soldiers in the Belgrade New Cemetery. The other German monument is today within the yard of a privately owned school, while Belgrade is no more visible from the spot as the Košutnjak forest expanded and completely engulfed the area. The only remaining visible mark of the cemetery itself is part of the fence.\n\nPionirski Grad (, ) is a sub-neighborhood of Košutnjak, in its south-central section, which belongs to the municipality of Rakovica. It is a small weekend-settlement, without permanent population, just west of the neighborhood of Filmski Grad. The name, \"pionirski grad\" in Serbian means \"pioneer's town\".\n\nFirst objects were built during the period of German occupation in World War II. An anti-aircraft unit of Luftwaffe was placed in the area in 1943. The soldiers built small houses in Alpine style on the glades, with typical cornices and Bavarian windows. In the surrounding area they dug numerous underground bunkers which are today decaying and are mostly covered with overgrowth. Those which are outside of the woods are occasionally rediscovered during construction works. After the war, architect Ratko Tatić developed the settlement.\n\nPionirski Grad covers an area of and is a non-residential settlement completely surrounded by the woods of Košutnjak. There are 9 pavilions with a total area of . They were organized as the Pionirski Grad in 1947 and, as the name says, were intended to be the children’s recreational center. Objects in the settlement include restaurant Ozon, two bungalows which serve as the kindergarten and outdoor terrains for basketball, futsal, handball, tennis, athletics and jogging. In the concrete hall there are indoor courts for futsal and squash, the first and only in Belgrade. Major building has an area of and contains restaurant, cabinets, classrooms, disco and artistic ateliers. Within the building there is also an amphitheatre with 600 seats, which was rented for \"Veliki Brat\", the Serbian version of the reality show \"Big Brother\"; for the talent show \"Operacija Trijumf\"; and for the \"I Love Serbia\" quiz show, the Serbian version of \"I Love My Country\". In its heyday Pionirski Grad had an attendance of 100,000 per year but it lost its recreational function when the refugees from the Yugoslav Wars were settled in seven pavilions from the 1990s to 2010s. The complex was partially renovated in the early 2010s: street lights were repaired, green areas rearranged and memorial plaques placed. A process of step-by-step reconstruction began in 2014. By 2017 the hall and the sports terrains have been renovated, the house of \"Big Brother\" was demolished and all objects have been vacated awaiting the reconstruction in 2018. Number of children visiting the premises during the year grew to 12,000 in 2016.\n"}

Born in the Bhonsle family, he was the son of Sambhaji, Shivaji's eldest son and successor. Shahu, as a child, was taken prisoner along with his mother in 1689 by Mughal sardar, Zulfikar Khan Nusrat Jang After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, leading Mughal courtiers released Shahu with a force of fifty men, thinking that a friendly Maratha leader would be a useful ally. At that time he fought a brief war with his aunt Tarabai in an internecine conflict to gain the Maratha throne in 1708. \n\nUnder Shahu's reign, Maratha power and influence extended to all corners of the Indian subcontinent. He was a powerful ruler of Maratha Samrajya after Shivaji I and Sambhaji I. However after his death, power moved from the ruling Chhatrapati to his ministers (the Peshwas) and the generals who had carved out their own fiefdoms such as Bhonsle of Nagpur, Gaekwad of Baroda, Scindia of Gwalior and Holkar of Indore.\n\nEarly in his reign, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj appointed Balaji Vishwanath as his Peshwa. Over the next fifty years, Balaji followed by his son, Bajirao I and grandson Balaji Bajirao with help of capable military leaders such as Shinde, Holkar, Gaekwad, Pawar and Bhonsle of Nagpur expanded Maratha power in all directions of the Indian subcontinent..\n\nShahu had four wives and fathered four daughters. Chhatrapati Shahu adopted Parvatibai when she was 3 years old. She was the daughter of a mamledar of Pen, Raigad. He gave her training in warfare and administration. He, later, got her married to Shrimant Sadashivrao Bhau when she was 15 years-old. Even though her father was alive, he did her kanyadan. He also adopted two sons, Fatehsinh I and Rajaram II of Satara (who succeeded him as the Raja of Satara). Rajaram II had been brought to him by Shahu's paternal aunt, Tarabai, who initially claimed that the young man was her grandson and a descendant of Shivaji, but later disowned him as an imposter. After Shahu's death the powers were indirectly shifted to the Peshwa Balaji Bajirao.\n\nAfter getting Parvatibai married to Sadashivrao Bhau, the valiant son of Chimaji Appa Peshwa and fixing Radhikabai's marriage with Vishwasrao Peshwa , he died in December 1749. His adopted son Rajaram II of Satara claimed to be Tarabai's grandson and succeeded him. But the actual power was held by others: first by Tarabai and then by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao.\n\n\n"}

The university was not reestablished in Modena until the 1680s and did not receive an imperial charter until 1685.\n\nSome famous students who attended the University include Ludovico Antonio Muratori, a noted Italian historian and scholar who graduated in 1694, the playwright Carlo Goldoni in the 17th century and, in the last century, Sandro Pertini, who became President of the Italian Republic.\n\nThe University of Modena dates back to 1175, a few decades after the birth of the University of Bologna, making it one of the oldest universities in Italy and the world. It was established by the city of Modena, which financed professors' contracts through local taxation. The first to be invited to teach was Pillio da Medicina from Bologna. The School of Law (Studium iuris) was subsequently formed around him and made up the nucleus of the University.\n\nIn the two centuries that followed, the Studium expanded from legal studies to include the training of notaries and the study of medicine as well. The subsequent history of the University was profoundly marked by the changing fortunes of the ruling Este family. Between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the Court of Este settled in Ferrara, academic titles were no longer awarded, and the activities of the Studium were greatly reduced.\n\nOnly after the Court moved to Modena in 1772 did the University regain its original splendour and academic prestige, receiving an imperial charter from Duke Francis II. The University offered multiple disciplines, including law, medicine and surgery, pharmacy, and mathematical, physical, and natural sciences.\n\nThe Department of Economics was established in 1968, followed by the Department of Engineering in 1989. The year 1998 was of fundamental importance in the history of the University when the Reggio Emilia site was instituted and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia was founded, with the support of local institutions.\n\nIn fact, Reggio Emilia already had an ancient and noble tradition of university studies which ended in 1772 following the reform of Duke Francis II of Este. A School of Law, proposed by the city, is mentioned as early as 1188. In 1532, Emperor Carl V granted the College of Judges the privilege of awarding diplomas and degrees in Law. Duke Alfonse II of Este established a Medical College in 1561 and ten years later, Emperor Maximilian II authorized the conferral of degrees in medicine. In the seventeenth century, a School of Letters was opened at the Seminary and, in the following century, a chair of Scholastic Theology was established along with schools of grammar and rhetoric. In 1752, the University of Reggio was inaugurated in Palazzo Busetti and consisted of four faculties: Law, Theology, Medicine and Philosophy. However, its activities continued only until 1772 when, after the reform of Francis II, its right to grant degrees was taken away and given solely to the University of Modena.\n\nThe creation of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia not only combined the ancient traditions of the two cities into one institution, but also gave a new and powerful boost to the development of the University, resulting in a substantial growth of scientific and academic activities, which still continues today.\n\nThe Department of Engineering and Agriculture was established in Reggio Emilia in 1998, followed in 1999, by the Department of Arts and Humanities in Modena. Subsequently, the University witnessed the birth of the Departments of Communication Sciences and of Education Sciences in Reggio Emilia, while growth continued in Modena with the institution of the Department of Biosciences and Biotechnologies.\n\nThe university is divided into fourteen Departments:\n\nArea: Technology\n\nArea: Life\n\nArea: Society\n\nArea: Health\n\nArea: Science\n\n\n\n\n"}

The parish includes the hamlet of Littleton Panell.\n\nThe parish was formerly known as Bishops' Lavington, the land having been granted to Roger, Bishop of Salisbury in 1136, and remaining in the hands of the bishopric throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Anglican All Saints' Church is Grade I listed. It is from the 12th century or earlier, with many later alterations and additions. It has a 1910 painting entitled \"Virgin and Child\" by Louis Davis.\n\nEbenezer Baptist Church was built at Littleton Panell in 1848 and is affiliated to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.\n\nAlso at Littleton Panell, a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1900. It closed in 1967, was bought by the Catholic Church, and reopened as St Joseph's in 1971.\n\nDauntsey's School, an independent day and boarding school, is in the village. The nearest state secondary school is Lavington School in Market Lavington.\n\nA primary school, Dauntsey Academy Primary School, was built in 1999 at a new site to replace a 19th-century building on the High Street.\n\nThe village has a pub, the Churchill Arms. There is a village hall, a shop with a post office, and a doctor's surgery.\n\nThe Stert and Westbury Railway was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway Company in 1900, providing routes from London to Weymouth and Taunton. At the same time, Lavington Station was built north of Littleton Panell where the line crosses the A360; it was closed in 1967. No local railway stations remain; the nearest are Pewsey and Westbury.\n\nLittleton Panell is a contiguous hamlet in the parish of West Lavington. Its extent is disputed but its centre is north of the A360/B3098 crossroads and south of the old railway station for the Great Western Railway. The former manor house is now offices and its grounds were, for many years, a fruit farm. More recently, they were planted as a vineyard and an orchard.\n\nWilliam Talman, architect and pupil of Sir Christopher Wren, was born at West Lavington in 1650.\n\nDavid Saunders, whose life inspired Hannah More's tract \"The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain\", was born at Littleton Pannell in 1717 and buried in West Lavington churchyard in 1796.\n\nRichard Godolphin Long was baptised at West Lavington in 1761. He became High Sheriff of Wiltshire and a Member of Parliament, and built Rood Ashton House near West Ashton.\n\nNigel Balchin (1908–1970) was an author and screenwriter. Son of the village baker, he was educated at Dauntsey's School and Cambridge University, and initially worked as an industrial psychologist. After a distinguished war record, he was thought (by John Betjeman, Elizabeth Bowen, L.P. Hartley and others) to be one of Britain's most promising novelists of the 1940s. He wrote \"The Small Back Room\" (later made into a film) and several other novels. His best-known film is \"The Man Who Never Was\", for which he received a BAFTA in 1956.\n\nActor George Baker, best known for playing Inspector Wexford on television, lived close to Periwinkle Pond in the village prior to his death in 2011.\n\n"}

Located in the south-eastern part of the Central Region, the Central Area consists of eleven constituent planning areas, the Downtown Core, Marina East, Marina South, the Museum Planning Area, Newton, Orchard, Outram, River Valley, Rochor, the Singapore River and Straits View, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The term Central Business District (CBD) has also been used to describe most of the Central Area as well, although its boundaries lie within the Downtown Core.\n\nThe Central Area surrounds the banks of the Singapore River and Marina Bay where the first settlements on the island were established shortly after the arrival of Raffles in 1819. Surrounding the Central Area is the rest of the Central Region. The Central Area shares boundaries with the planning areas of Novena to the north, Kallang to the north and north-east, Tanglin to the north-west and west, Bukit Merah to the south-west and Marine Parade to the east. The south-easternmost limits of the city is enclosed by Marina Barrage, where the mouth of Marina Bay meets the Singapore Strait.\n\nMuch of the central area bounded by Telok Ayer Road, which has a high concentration of skyscrapers, is built on reclaimed land. Therefore, the Thian Hock Keng Temple built in 1839 along Telok Ayer Road used to face the sea and it was visited by Chinese immigrants giving thanks to Ma Zu (Goddess of the Sea) for their safe voyage. Prior to 1839, the temple served as a joss-house for the Hokkien immigrants. This temple, which is also the first Hokkien temple to be built by the Hokkien clan under the leadership of Tan Tock Seng and Si Hoo Keh, is in the architectural style of southern China, using only materials imported from China and supported with no nails. The clan’s office was housed there and this temple was also used as a meeting venue. The construction of the temple was completed in 1842 and details of this temple’s history are recorded in granite tablets found on the wall inside the Entrance Hall. A plaque inscribed with the words Bo Jing Nan Ming (Gentle Waves over the South Seas) which was presented by the Guangxu Emperor in 1907, is found in this temple providing evidence of the temple’s stature. The temple comprises an architectural works of stone, tiles and wood, dragons and phoenixes, as well as carvings, sculptures and columns.\n\nAt Church Street is the Yueh Hai Ching Temple, one of the oldest Taoist temples, having been built in 1826. This temple was established by a group of Teochew settlers from Guangzhou in China when they dedicated a shrine to Tian Hou. This temple faced the sea and was therefore a place where newly arrived Chinese immigrants (sailors and travellers included) came to offer their thanks to the Goddess for their safe voyage across the seas. The renovation to the temple was undertaken by the Ngee Ann Kongsi, which was formed by a group of immigrants from the Teochew community. This temple served as a meeting place for the people of the Teochew community in the late 19th century when the Teochews became the second largest Chinese Dialect group in Singapore. The temple was honoured with a \"bian e\", an imperial signboard from Emperor Guang Xu of the Qing Dynasty in 1907. In 1996 it was gazetted as a national monument and it underwent repairs and restoration works. This temple is a silent testimony to the faith and gratitude of many people in Singapore. The background contrast between the old temples and the new modern buildings indicate the juxtaposition and coexistence of new and old. The temple has a cover structure composed of models depicting the lives of Chinese villagers. The then-emperor of China also presented the temple with a signboard that is still displayed in the temple till today. \n\nThe Armenian Church, located at Hill Street, is the oldest church in Singapore. The funding for the building of the church came from contributions of the Armenian community. It was built in the 1830s by George Coleman, the architect of many buildings in Singapore, for a small Armenian community that once resided in Singapore. The Church was credited as a national monument.\n\nCHIJMES, located at Victoria Street, was originally a Catholic convent which is currently converted into a modern dining area with restaurants. The original structure was well preserved and the chapel is still present. The restaurants reside in the old structures of the convent.\n\nThe Central Area is one of the most densely developed places in Singapore, with a large mix of commercial and residential developments packed into a space of only 1784 hectares. A great number of Mass Rapid Transit stations are concentrated in this area as well, especially interchange stations and stations along the Circle MRT Line. Each of the districts within the Central Area has a heavy and dense commercial presence, especially in the Downtown Core, Orchard and Singapore River districts. Rochor, Newton, River Valley and Outram are commercially thriving, but have fewer skyscrapers and generally include a greater residential presence. Schools, condominiums and Housing Development Board apartments are located in these areas, albeit at higher prices.\n\nSince the 1970s, the Singapore government and the Urban Redevelopment Authority have reclaimed land portions from Marina Bay in an attempt to expand the Central Area. Newly created portions of land surrounding Marina Bay have been organised and labelled into Marina East, Marina South and Straits View. Many construction projects have been completed in these districts since their creation, but most of them are still under consolidation or development. It also houses the headquarters of many Multinational Companies and the Singapore Stock Exchange. The tallest skyscrapers in Singapore are located at the Central Area, mainly the Raffles Place area. They adhere to a height restriction of 280m, except the Tanjong Pagar Centre, which is exempted from the height restriction and is allowed to be built up to 290m.\n\nShophouses on Ann Siang Hill have changed purposes over the years. In the past, these shophouses were used as clan houses for the various clans that existed in the Chinatown region. Due to a housing shortage exacerbated by World War II, HDB began development of the blocks after the war.\n\n\n"}

The Domesday Book of 1086 also mentions some of the Burnhams (see external links). At one time there were indeed seven Burnham villages, all within a radius of two miles. These were:\n\n\nHence the mnemonic for the seven Burnhams: \"Nelson Of Thorpe Died Well Under Sail\".\n\nIt is thought that Burnham Market is one of the original seven Burnhams, but this is incorrect. Burnham Market is a modern merging of three Burnhams: Burnham Sutton, Burnham Westgate and Burnham Ulph. Over the years those three central villages have merged to form the larger village and civil parish of Burnham Market, which forms the principal centre for the Burnhams and several other nearby villages. The most westerly of the villages, Burnham Deepdale, has more or less merged with the neighbouring village of Brancaster Staithe, and both are now part of the civil parish of Brancaster.\n\nBurnham Norton and Burnham Thorpe still exist as separate villages and civil parishes, much as they always have. Burnham Overy is still a single civil parish, but in modern times a distinction is often made between the two settlements of \"Burnham Overy Town\" (actually a small settlement adjacent to the parish church) and \"Burnham Overy Staithe\" (a rather larger settlement about a mile away and next to the creek-side harbour).\n\nThe Burnhams are all located either on the River Burn, or adjacent to its mouth, and the name Burnham may derive from this.\n\nBurnhamthorpe Road in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada was named after Burnham Thorpe.\n\n"}

Dependent upon the year of design, and the decade of introduction, the webbing system was designated, and is commonly referred to, as either the \"85 Pattern\", the \"90 Pattern\" or the \"95 Pattern\" webbing.\n\nThe basic configuration consists of a belt, a shoulder harness and a number of individual pouches. Associated with the PLCE webbing system is a series of other similar load carrying equipment, individual items and rucksacks that are produced of the same materials and feature high interoperability.\n\nThe purpose of the PLCE webbing system is to retain the means by which a British soldier may operate for 48 hours or conduct a mission-specific task. Items and components may include a variety of munitions and weapon ancillaries, a three-fold entrenching tool, a bayonet, food and water (including a means to heat water and prepare food), Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear \"(CBRN)\" protective clothing and communications equipment.

This system, after having been introduced to the forces in 1960, and considered long outdated by 1980, was still being part of the standard issue equipment of the British Armed Forces during the Falklands War in 1982.\n\nTo overcome the common issues associated with canvas materials, such as shrinking and accelerated decomposition in damp climate conditions, arctic climate conditions, or constant exposure to wet terrain, military load bearing systems, outside of the range of use by the British Armed Forces, had been revised to incorporate or be produced of newer and tougher materials.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the United States Armed Forces had introduced and serviced the M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE) in 1968, and later the All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE) in 1974. Both systems had incorporated non-decomposing synthetic fabrics and were produced of highly durable nylon material.\n\nFollowing this influential lead, and reconsidering the progression and renewal of military load bearing systems around the world, Britain developed the Type 72 Pattern webbing, which mainly consisted of two ammunition pouches, to be worn on the front, and a field pack, to be worn on the back, produced of Polyurethane-coated nylon and Butyl rubber. This system was never generally issued, but was a Troop Trials Equipment.\n\nThe National People's Army (\"Nationale Volksarmee\") of the German Democratic Republic designed and introduced the \"Uniformtrageversuch\" 85-90 (UTV 85-90), resembling, with the exception of the clothing system, a modified duplicate of the British Type 58 Pattern webbing, inheriting very similar features in appearance and function. The shoulder harness was of identical design, the belt had featured the use of identical buckles, and Type 58 Pattern C-hooks had been incorporated in all components. Complementary items, such as pouches, had been changed in design and size, to meet Warsaw Pact requirements. The webbing system and components were produced of a more robust Nylon material, and featured the Strichtarn camouflage pattern. Whilst this late improvement was observed by the British Armed Forces, and being found to be an affront, especially against the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), no further considerations have been made, as the testing of prototypic PLCE equipment was already underway.\n\nDevelopments resumed with the progression of the firearms development and introduction of the SA80 family of British small arms. Trials of experimental PLCE webbing and Combat Body Armour (CBA) were conducted with selected units in 1984 and 1985. Being very similar to the first standard issue PLCE webbing system, it used snaps of proprietary design for closure on all pouches.\n\nSeven years after the Falklands Conflict, the first standard issue PLCE webbing was introduced in 1989, it was designated the Type \"90 Pattern\" webbing and was Olive (OD/OG) in colour.\n\nThe original components used Type 58 Pattern C-hooks for the belt attachment, and angled D-rings for the shoulder harness attachment on the ammunition pouches. There were separate left and right pouches. The first utility pouches in production, had additional belt attachments for high mounting, similar to the ammunition pouches of the 1937 Pattern Web Equipment or Type 44 Pattern webbing. Later produced PLCE webbing of the Type 90 Pattern incorporates ambidextrous yoke fittings and the standard PLCE webbing belt attachments (see below).\n\nThe PLCE webbing system was also adopted by the Danish Defence Forces (\"Forsvaret\") in the M84 camouflage pattern and by the Defence Forces of Ireland (\"Óglaigh na hÉireann\") in Olive drab. The Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces now employ the Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System (IPLCS).\n\nMany other countries still issue, or have issued similar load bearing systems. By way of example, in its year of introduction to the forces, the United States Armed Forces have adopted the Individual Integrated Fighting System (IIFS).\n\nThe newest variant of the PLCE webbing system, of the Type 90 Pattern, has been in production since 1992 and features the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) camouflage pattern as being an integral feature of the now partially obsolete Combat Soldier 95 (\"Soldier 95\") clothing system. The official designation remained unchanged.\n\nWith the introduction of the Combat Soldier 95 (CS95 or \"Soldier 95\") clothing system in 1995, the common misconception arose that a complete revision of the Type 90 Pattern PLCE webbing system was taking place.\n\nThe clothing system underwent final development and entered troop trials in between the years 1992 and 1995. Garments were specifically manufactured for these trials, yet the PLCE webbing system issued, officially remained of the Type 90 Pattern.\n\nDue to confusion, or for the sake of convenience, individual components of the webbing system, were now, as of 1995, unofficially designated, described, and specified as the Type 95 Pattern webbing, as having been widely understood to be part of the Combat Soldier 95 clothing system. No such official change of designation had taken place.\n\nThe only array of PLCE components that could be considered of the unofficial Type 95 Pattern, are those components produced during or after the year of 1995.\n\nThe PLCE webbing system is produced from double-layered 1000 Denier internally rubberised Cordura Nylon, a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. Olive webbing of the same material (\"1000 D\") is being incorporated, along with a variety of hard wearing plastic fasteners (ITW Nexus), Hook and loop fasteners (Velcro) and anti-magnetic press stud fasteners (\"Pull the Dot\").\n\nThe pouches are opened and closed with Spanish Tab fasteners, they can be closed in two different ways, quick release or secure. Small sections of Velcro, sewn on the inside of the lids of the pouches, and the top front section of the pouches, allow for easy and effortless fastening. Added silencer strips allow to cover them when not needed.\n\nA standard ammunition pouch as issued (\"Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.\") has two pockets; single pocket versions (\"Pouch, Ammunition (Other Arms), DPM, IRR.\") are available for those individuals not required to carry as much ammunition. Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a dividing strip to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these dividing strips to make it easier to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.\n\nInfrared Reflective (IRR) coating and dyes are incorporated in all fabric and webbing of the PLCE webbing system, which replicates the near-infrared reflectance of natural foliage.\nFor example, green foliage is highly reflective to near-infrared light and thus appears white when viewed through IR optics (or bright green through night vision). The IRR camouflage pattern therefore works correctly when viewed through infrared night vision optics just as it does in visible light. Non IRR fabric would appear as a solid colour dependant on its reflectance and the camouflage pattern would be lost.\n\nThe Infantry Trials and Development Unit (ITDU) based in Warminster, conducted trials with the PLCE webbing system. It had decided for the system to be fit for purpose, and divided the system into three orders of dress:\n\nThe Assault Order consists of the very essentials needed to conduct a military task in the theatre of war. Ammunition, the water bottle, the entrenching tool, the bayonet, the helmet, and CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protective clothing (stowed in one of the detachable side pouches of the rucksack) is to be carried on operations and patrols of only short duration.\nThe Combat Order is the Assault Order in addition to the means of stowage for rations and personal equipment, that enable the British soldier to live and fight for a period of 24 hours. The second side pouch of the rucksack is now carried. In practice, the patrol packs are used by many units and individual soldiers instead of the side pouches, as they are to be found larger in size and more convenient.\nThe Marching Order is the Combat Order in addition to the carrying of the rucksack (Bergen) and is the fighting load required for operations of up to the duration of two weeks, without means of resupply, except for ammunition, rations and water. The complete Bergen (with side pouches attached) is being carried.\n\nThe initial basis of the PLCE webbing system is the belt; it features two D-rings at the back to attach to the shoulder harness, and many rows of narrow vertical slots sewn into the fabric. Two or more front pouches (ammunition or utility) attach to the belt; these have belt loops and feature T-Bar plastic tab attachments to provide more stability and security when connected to the belt. Every major component of the PLCE webbing system features two T-Bar plastic tab attachments.\n\nThe six-point shoulder harness attaches to the two D-rings on the belt and the two A-rings on each front pouch chosen. This benefits the distribution of weight and allows for a more comfortable carry, than provided with the use of a four-point shoulder harness. Pouches that are to be worn on the back (field pack, utility, water bottle, respirator, wire cutter, entrenching tool) attach to the belt using the same loop and tab system.\n\nThe detachable side pouches of a Bergen (\"Pouch, Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.\") can be attached to the dedicated shoulder harness (\"Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.\") to construct a day-sack.\n\nIn the year 1997, the Defence Clothing & Textile Agency (\"DCTA\") had decided, that Type \"90 Pattern (Infantry)\" equipment was to be scaled and issued in the following capacity.\n\nThe standard issue accoutrement today, dependent upon the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (\"Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.\") instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching tool pouch (\"Carrier, Entrenching Tool Case, DPM, IRR.\") is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.\n\nMulti Terrain Pattern (MTP) PLCE is replacing all Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) PLCE as the core issued webbing equipment for the British Armed Forces, this program started in 2015.\n\nThe following example of individual components, are all current issue items of the British Armed Forces, however many Commercial variants are available.\n\nA new standard issue piece of equipment (\"Waistcoat, Mans, General Purpose Ops.\") that was designed for carrying essential items on a more secure platform than the original PLCE webbing system.\n\nThis consists of a typical waistcoat design, fastened with three ITW Nexus clips. Two triple ammunition pouches are situated on the left hand side of the coat, along with a utility pouch, small utility pouch and a zippered pocket with an internal holster. The right side is similar but with three large utility pouches, along with a small utility pouch and again a zippered pocket with notepad holder. All pouches open and close with ITW Nexus clips as well as having storm seals.\n\nThe vest is adjusted through four ladderlock fasteners and webbing, the shoulders are adjustable with Velcro material. The concept is to gain a secure load carrying system that fits over body armour comfortably. There are various types of this vest depending upon the year of manufacture. The originals are as described above but newer models have loops on the left side for the bayonet frog, clips for a large hydration pouch, name patches on the left side, and a small utility pouch. Most recently, the Spanish tab fasteners are being incorporated again, instead of the ITW Nexus clips.\n\nThe standard issue assault vest, depending on the operational requirements, is available in either the Disruptive Pattern Material (\"DPM\") camouflage pattern, or the Desert DPM (\"DDPM\") camouflage pattern. Commercial variants are available in multiple colours, such as Black, Green, or the American Desert Camouflage Uniform (\"DCU\") camouflage pattern.\n\nThe main criticism of the PLCE webbing system amongst members of the British Armed Forces, is that the belt is prone to slipping. Some soldiers opt to change the plastic buckle for a Roll-Pin type, whereby the belt is threaded and tightened each time it is put on.\n\nIn 2015, \"VIRTUS\" the Personal Protective Equipment and Load Carriage System, began being issued to high readiness units.\n\nDue to the introduction and constant improvement of protective equipment, such as the Osprey Body Armour (\"OBA\"), the PLCE webbing system is incompatible so Osprey Mk 4 has a MOLLE belt and under armour Yoke to allow Osprey pouches to be used as belt equipment.\n\nAfter the first introduction in 1989, PLCE in its current MTP form is still Britain's core issue webbing equipment which is compatible with ECBA armour and Mk 6 and 7 helmet, with Osprey issued to non-deployed infantry, leaving Virtus issued to deployed Infantry Commando and Parachute Units.\n\nMost other nations are developing, or have developed more modular load bearing systems, such as the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (\"MOLLE\") which is being widely employed by most branches of the United States Armed Forces. Following this major improvement, the Pouch Attachment Ladder System (\"PALS\") had been incorporated into the Osprey Body Armour (\"OBA\") platform, which is currently being issued to British troops on operations world-wide.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977073", "title": "Joondalup", "text": "Joondalup\n\nJoondalup () is a northern suburb of Perth, Western Australia, approximately north of Perth's central business district. It acts as the primary urban centre in Perth's northern suburbs.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1960s, the \"Metropolitan Regional Planning Authority\" developed the \"Corridor Plan for Perth\" which was published and adopted in 1970. The plan called for the creation of five \"sub-regional\" retail centres (Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland, Armadale and Rockingham) which would form the commercial and economic focus of each \"node\", and take the retail burden away from the CBD. The Corridor Plan was not endorsed by Parliament until 1973.\n\nIn order to grow both the five \"sub-regional\" retail centres and these off-corridor regional shopping centres, a \"Retail Shopping Policy\" was developed by MRPA in 1976, and a \"Perth Metropolitan Region Retail Structure Plan\" was put in place to regulate the industry. This Plan was amended as new centres were required. A review of the Corridor Plan in 1987 found that the sub-regional centres had failed to adequately compete against the regional shopping centres in the middle-distance suburbs.\n\nMost of the land in the area remained largely undeveloped until the 1960s, and Joondalup started to become the \"city of the north\" towards the late 1980s to the early 1990s when houses and businesses were established in the area. Joondalup is the key regional hub for the north of Perth, a status confirmed by the Western Australian State Government's new Directions 2031 strategy which names Joondalup town centre as one of two Primary Centres for the Perth metropolitan area.\n\nThe city is named after Lake Joondalup. The name Joondalup is a Noongar word, first recorded in 1837 and possibly meaning either \"place of whiteness or glistening\", or \"place of a creature that can only move backwards\".\n\nJoondalup as a centre has no statutory boundaries. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has determined a statistical area that covers all of the City of Joondalup north of Ocean Reef Road, which uses Lakeside Joondalup as a regional shopping centre and uses Joondalup railway station as a public transport hub. This area is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the west, Lake Joondalup to the east and the city boundary to the north, and encompasses the following suburbs\n\nJoondalup has a large Christian majority, comprising 49% of the city's religious following, with the two largest denominations being Anglican (12,208 or 24.6%) and Catholic (12,154, 24.1%). 21.6% of Joondalup's population professed no religion.\n\nJoondalup contains a fairly youthful population, with a median age of 28, compared to the Australian national average of 37 in 2006.\n\nJoondalup is governed by the City of Joondalup local government area, which covers the whole city area and extends southwards to the suburbs of Sorrento, Duncraig and Greenwood. Until 1998, the area was entirely governed by the neighbouring City of Wanneroo. \n\nJoondalup's central business district, centred on Grand Boulevard, is largely a shopping and retail area lined with townhouses and apartments. Lakeside Joondalup Shopping City is located adjacent to the Joondalup railway station and backs onto Grand Boulevard.\n\nJoondalup is home to the Joondalup Festival, an annual event that takes place in the CBD featuring markets, music, fashion, street arts, fairground rides and street parades. The festival is free-of-charge and attracts people from all over the Perth metropolitan area. Kaleidoscope Festival has also been held in the city since 2016, featuring various art and light installations. The festival attracted over 50,000 people in its inaugural year.\n\nThe city has a number of parks including Central Park and Neil Hawkins Park in the Yellagonga Regional Park. The Neil Hawkins Park is home to many parrots, including the Australian ringneck, cockatoos and kangaroos. The park is located alongside Lake Joondalup and wetlands which stretches out between Burns Beach Road to the north and Ocean Reef Road to the south. These wetlands provide refuge for migratory birds.\n\nJoondalup's coastal front consists of Burns Beach in the north and Beaumaris Beach in Ocean Reef, running onto the Ocean Reef Boat Harbour in the south.\n\nJoondalup is home to ECU Joondalup SC, Joondalup United FC and Sorrento FC who play in the National Premier Leagues which is Australia's second tier association football league. Sorrento FC is one of Joondalup's most successful clubs and their derbies with ECU Joondalup are always eagerly anticipated.\n\nArena Joondalup, located northwest of Lakeside Shopping Centre, is the home venue of West Perth Football Club and Wanneroo Basketball Association. The Arena also hosts music events and festivals during the year, as well as the Home and Lifestyle Expo, an annual exhibition held in late March to early April.\n\nFurthermore, in the early 1990s with the addition of the Western Reds to the National Rugby League, the Joondalup Giants was established playing home games from Admiral Park in WARL completion.\n\nJoondalup is a popular city for nightlife on weekends and Friday nights, with most of its pubs and nightclubs located in close proximity to each other in the CBD. The city was granted the status of \"tourism precinct\" by the State Government in 2009, allowing extended retail trading hours. \n\nThe council chambers for the City of Joondalup are located in Joondalup's central business district. The complex includes Joondalup Library, which serves as the central library and local history centre for both the City of Joondalup and the City of Wanneroo local authorities. The Joondalup Health Campus, the major public hospital for Perth's northern suburbs, a major police station and the Joondalup offices of the Australian Electoral Commission are also located in the CBD.\n\nJoondalup contains the following significant tertiary institutions or campuses in its central business district:\n\nThe following secondary colleges are scattered around the Joondalup urban area and cover large catchment areas:\n\nJoondalup contains a major public hospital, Joondalup Health Campus, which serves as the main health facility for most of Perth's northern suburbs, as far north as Two Rocks. Joondalup Private Hospital is also incorporated into the public Health Campus, and both facilities are owned and operated by Ramsay Health Care.\n\nThe Joondalup region's primary potable water supply comes from the nearby Gnangara Mound. The water is treated at the Wanneroo Groundwater Treatment Plant and, as in most of Western Australia, is managed by the Water Corporation.\n\nJoondalup is situated on the Mitchell Freeway and forms the northern terminus of the road. The freeway links Joondalup to Perth and further south and has the following exits in the city:\n\nTwo lesser arterial roads, Joondalup Drive and Marmion Avenue, run parallel to the freeway through the eastern and western suburbs respectively, with all three roads sharing the same major exits in the urban area. Joondalup Drive links Joondalup east to Wanneroo Road and the suburbs of the City of Wanneroo, while Marmion Avenue follows the course of the freeway south, to West Coast Highway and Perth's inner coastal suburbs.\n\nThe city contains three railway stations on the Joondalup line, at Edgewater, Currambine and the Joondalup CBD, providing a direct rail link to the Perth CBD, as well as Butler in the north. The Joondalup interchange acts as a large public transport hub, providing bus links to all surrounding suburbs in the City of Joondalup LGA, as well as Banksia Grove in the City of Wanneroo.\n\nJoondalup is one of three urban precincts in Perth to have free CAT bus services (the other two being Fremantle and the Perth CBD). CAT Routes 10 and 11 travel around Joondalup's central precinct, ferrying passengers to Lakeside Joondalup Shopping Centre, Joondalup Health Campus, Edith Cowan University, West Coast Institute of Training and various stops around the CBD.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977075", "title": "Brancaster", "text": "Brancaster\n\nBrancaster is a village and civil parish on the north coast of the English county of Norfolk. The civil parish of Brancaster comprises Brancaster itself, together with Brancaster Staithe and Burnham Deepdale. The three villages form a more or less continuous settlement along the A149 at the edge of the Brancaster Manor marshland and the Scolt Head Island National Nature Reserve. The villages are located about 3 miles (5 km) west of Burnham Market, 22 miles (35 km) north of the town of King's Lynn and 31 miles (50 km) north-west of the city of Norwich.\nThe civil parish has an area of 8.27 square miles (21.43 km) and in the 2011 census had a population of 797 in 406 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Janet Lake, the clerk to Brancaster Parish Council, has recently reached 50 years of service in the post.\nSt Mary's church at Burnham Deepdale is one of 124 existing round-tower churches in Norfolk; it also has a carved Norman font.\n\nA petrified forest can be seen on the foreshore near Brancaster at low tide. It is about three-quarters of a mile west of the golf clubhouse and consists of material similar to compacted peat or brown coal (lignite). Remains also wash ashore after storms and can be found along the high tide line. The material resembles black rubber but can be broken easily to reveal plant remains inside.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population at the 2011 Census of 1,293.\n\nThere was a Roman fort and settlement here named Branodunum to the east of the modern village. The Saxon Shore fort (and the related civilian settlement, much of which was destroyed during the construction of a locally opposed housing development in the 1970s) is visible only as grass-covered mounds and remains mainly unexcavated.\n\nThe wreck that can be seen off the harbour is the 1021grt coaster \"SS Vina\" which was used for target practice by the RAF before accidentally sinking in 1944. The \"Vina\" was built at Leith by Ramage & Ferguson in 1894 and was registered at Grangemouth. She was a coast-hugging general cargo ship which would have worked the crossings between the east coast of England and through to the Baltic states.\n\nAs she neared the end of her useful seagoing life in 1940, \"Vina\" was requisitioned as a naval vessel for wartime use as a blockship, carrying a crew of 12. With Great Yarmouth being a strategic port on the east coast, the ultimate fate for the ship would have been to have had her hold filled with concrete and explosives and she would have been sunk at the harbour mouth, blocking entry in the event of a Nazi invasion. Once this threat passed, she was taken out of blockship service and towed up the east coast towards Brancaster where she was used as a target for the RAF before the planned invasion of Normandy in 1944.\n\nOriginally anchored further out to sea on the Titchwell side as a target for cannon shell trials, she dragged her anchor on 20 August 1944, in a north-westerly gale and ran ashore. Numerous efforts have been made to remove the wreck from the sandbank as the ship is not only a danger to navigation but also attracts holiday makers who walk out to the vessel's remains at low tide. Various parts have been removed and, in 1968, her bronze propeller was blown off by salvagers and floated across the harbour channel. Removal efforts have long been abandoned as uneconomic.\n\nLives have been lost due to ill-advised attempts to reach the \"Vina\" as it is on the far side of a fast-flowing tidal harbour channel. Local lifeboats and RAF rescue helicopters have been pressed into service on many occasions. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.\n\nThe beach area and some of the marshes are managed by the National Trust.\n\nThe village is home to the Royal West Norfolk Golf Club. The Royal West Norfolk Golf Club was founded in 1892, its design being from Holcombe Ingleby. In 2014 it was listed as the 47th best golf course in the UK and Ireland by Golf Monthly magazine.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Brancaster was considered as a possible location for the launching site for the British space programme. This idea was expanded to include the village becoming the base for a facility that could be used by a spaceplane to undertake secret flights over the USSR. Development would have meant that the village would probably have been razed and the villagers rehoused.\n\nThe eventual installation of oil rigs in the North Sea saw the idea shelved, as the risk, however slight, of atmospheric re-entry material hitting the rigs, was too great.\n\n\n\n\n"}

DAR is often represented by dialect spelling \"t'\" or \"th'\".\n\nDAR has been recorded in textual form since 1673, and the orthographic representations \"t'\" and \"th'\" occur in literature (such as in Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\") and are frequently encountered in the media. The historical origin is unclear. Links with Middle English \"te\" forms of the article remain unproved.\n\nA similar usage of an article with a consonant \"t'\" can also be found in Modern Dutch and in the West Frisian language off the north Netherlands coast. In these languages, \"t\" clearly derives from the neuter definite article (Dutch \"het\" and West Frisian \"it)\" because the Dutch and Frisian masculine and feminine singular as well as plural definite article \"de\" cannot become \"t\").\n\nThe family name \"Huis in't Feld\" exists in Dutch, meaning \"house in the field\". Claims that this is phonetically similar to DAR remain to be verified experimentally. In Cumbria, a voiceless alveolar plosive (the English \"t\" sound) does occur, which may have some superficial similarities to realizations in West Frisian and Low German, but the glottal and glottalised DAR variants found elsewhere in the DAR area and across Yorkshire present a very different realisation. Jones (2002: 342) comments that no contact explanation with other varieties of Germanic is required (or could be supported on the basis of available evidence) to explain DAR as the development of DAR involves common cross-linguistic patterns of change (stopping of dental fricatives, change of plosive to glottal) that occur in unrelated languages and so have a purely phonetic origin.\n\nThe phonetic forms of DAR are very varied. The \"th'\" form suggests a voiceless dental fricative realisation, usually voiceless (as in \"th\"in), and is restricted to the western parts of the DAR area (Lancashire and Cheshire). It also occurred widely across northern and central Staffordshire in earlier dialect surveys (Jones 2002) and sporadic forms similar to DAR were reported to occur in localities in Berkshire, Sussex, and Essex, and also in Aylesham in Kent owing to the large influx of miners from Northern England to work in the Kent Coalfield. The \"t\" form suggests a voiceless alveolar plosive or a voiceless dental plosive realisation , as in \"t\"in, but also serves to represent a 'glottal' form. The glottal form is most widely encountered. Some dialects may show more than one phonetic form, but the conditioning factors for such variation are unknown. It seems that unvarying glottal forms are most widely found now (2005). Variation with a full form \"the\" is also common.\n\nSpeakers of other forms of English often find it difficult to hear, especially the 'glottal' forms that affect the pitch and duration and voice quality of surrounding words and sounds in subtle ways. This often leads to claims that the article is absent, but this is rarely the case. True absence of the article may occur in the east of the DAR area around Kingston upon Hull.\n\nRecent instrumental acoustic work (2007) shows that DAR speakers use very subtle differences in the quality and timing of glottalisation to differentiate between a glottal stop occurring as an allophone of final /t/ in a word like \"seat\" and a glottal stop occurring as the form of the definite article in otherwise identical sentences (compare \"seat sacks\" and \"see t' sacks\"). Speakers of DAR dialects therefore appear to have (put somewhat simplistically) two kinds of glottal stop: one for DAR and one for word-final /t/.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977090", "title": "Pumapard", "text": "Pumapard\n\nA pumapard is a hybrid of a puma and a leopard. Both male puma with female leopard and male leopard with female puma pairings have produced offspring. In general, these hybrids have exhibited a tendency to dwarfism.\n\nIn the late 1890s / early 1900s, two hybrids were born in Chicago, United States, followed two years later by three sets of twin cubs born at a zoo in Hamburg, Germany, from a puma father and leopard mother. Carl Hagenbeck apparently bred several litters of hybrids in 1898 at the suggestion of a menagerie owner in Great Britain; this was possibly Lord Rothschild (as one of the hybrids is preserved in his museum) who may have heard of the two hybrid cubs bred in Chicago in 1896 and suggested that Hagenbeck reproduce the pairing.\n\nHagenbeck's puma / leopard hybrids may have been inspired by a pair of hybrid cubs born in Chicago on 24 April 1896 at Tattersall's indoor arena, where Ringling Brothers Circus opened its season: \nA similar hybrid was reported by Helmut Hemmer. These hybrids had puma-like long tails and sandy or tawny coats with chestnut leopard-like markings and puma-like cheek markings. Another was described as resembling a little gray puma with large brown rosettes.\n\nHenry Scherren wrote: \n\nIn his \"Guide\", described it as \"a little grey puma with large brown rosettes\". Another hybrid between the same species, but with a puma for sire and a leopard for dam, was recently at Stellingen; it resembled the female parent in form as may be seen from the reproduction from a photograph taken there.\n\nAccording to Carl Hagenbeck (1951), a male puma and female leopard produced a hybrid male cub that was reared by a Fox Terrier bitch at Hagenbeck Tierpark, Hamburg (fostering being normal practice at this time). This male hybrid was intermediate between the puma and leopard in color and pattern, having faint leopard spots on a puma-colored background. The body length was much less than either parent, while the tail was long, like the puma. Hagenbeck apparently bred these hybrids at the suggestion of an unidentified menagerie owner; however, the hybrids were considered dull and uninteresting. Modern geneticists find them more interesting because the leopard and the puma were not considered to be closely enough related to produce offspring.\n\nH. Petzsch (1956) mentioned that puma/leopard hybrids had been obtained by artificial insemination. H. Hemmer (1966) reported the hybrid between a male Indian leopard (\"P. p. fusca\") and a female puma as being fairly small, with a ground color like that of the puma and having rather faded rosettes.\n\nThe hybrids were additionally reported by C. J. Cornish \"et al\". (undated), R. Rörig (1903), T. Haltenorth (1936), and O. Antonius (1951).\n\nWhether born to a male puma mated to a leopardess, or to a male leopard mated to a female puma, pumapards inherit a form of dwarfism. Those reported grew to only half the size of the parents. They have a puma-like long body (proportional to the limbs, but nevertheless shorter than either parent) with short legs. The coat is variously described as sandy, tawny or grayish with brown, chestnut or \"faded\" rosettes.\n\nOne is preserved in the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring, England, and clearly shows the tendency to dwarfism. This hybrid was exhibited at the Tierpark in Stellingen (Hamburg).\n\nA black and white photograph of the Tring hybrid appeared in \"Animals of the World\" (1917) with the caption \"This is a photograph from life of a very rare hybrid. That animal's father was a puma, its mother a leopard. It is now dead and it may be seen stuffed in Mr. Rothschild's Museum at Tring.\"\n\n\nSome content of this article is reproduced from , which is licensed under the GFDL.\n\n"}

Until 1 July 2014, when it became part of the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" Wittlich-Land, it was the seat of the former \"Verbandsgemeinde\" Manderscheid.\n\nThe town lies in the South Eifel between the rivers Lieser in the east and Kleine Kyll in the west. Northeast of Manderscheid lies the Bleckhausen Juniper Conservation Area, the biggest of its kind in the whole Eifel.\n\nYearly precipitation in Manderscheid amounts to 908 mm, which is high, falling into the highest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 78% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is twice what it is in April. Precipitation varies moderately. At 52% of the weather stations, lower seasonal are recorded.\n\nThe first part of the placename Manderscheid is derived from the Celtic word \"mantara\" (pine), the second part from a Celtic word meaning 'forest'. The Manderscheid area was settled from very early times on. Near Schwarzenborn, several Stone Age settlements have been found. It is also known that near Mehren - only some miles away from Manderscheid - so many graves from Hallstatt times with lots of jewelled objects and tools have been unearthed that archaeologists and historians speak of a “Mehren culture”. Near Wallscheid, graves from Hallstatt and La Tène times have been found, too, and likewise near Laufeld. Near Wallscheid, two iron arrowheads that come from this era and a bronze vessel were found.\n\nMore numerous have been the finds from Roman times. Besides the “Villa of Bettenfeld”, which was unearthed in 1863 at the foot of the Mosenberg (mountain), Roman finds come to light in almost every town and village in the surrounding area.\n\nIn Dierfeld and Wallscheid, remnants of other such villas have been found, as have graves and urns in Laufeld, Manderscheid, Öfflingen, Pantenburg, Wallscheid, Großlittgen, Oberkail and Karl, as well as the odd coin.\n\nBesides the \"Viergötterstein\" (a “four-god stone”, a pedestal on which a Jupiter Column was customarily stood), special attention is earned by two altars from Großlittgen that were found in Pantenburg in 1920. They were dedicated to the god Vovotius and the goddesses Boudina and Alauna and might have belonged to a Gallo-Roman spring sanctum.\n\nThis may make it clear that a great many settlements in the surrounding area arose as early as Roman times.\n\nRarer are finds from Frankish times, as they are almost everywhere.\n\nIn Pantenburg a lance, a spear and a shield were found, and in Eckfeld a sword and a ventail.\n\nDespite the dearth of finds from this time, it can be assumed that there was considerably more settlement, and that most of today's population centres arose in that time, as witnessed by places with names ending in \"—scheid\", \"—feld\" or \"—ingen\". Thus, Officinus Villa (now Öfflingen) was mentioned in 794 and 895, Manderscheid and Eckiveld (Eckfeld) in 973, and Louvenvelt (Laufeld) in 1161.\n\nManderscheid, known in the Middle Ages as \"Manderschiet\", had its first documentary mention in 973. From the mid 12th century it belonged to the Archbishop-Electorate of Trier. Elector Balduin granted it town rights in 1332. Manderscheid was the seat of an Electoral-Trier \"Amt\" and at the same time also of the counts of Manderscheid. Beginning in 1794, Manderscheid lay under French rule. In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The building of the former Electoral \"Kellnerei\" (a ministerial administrative establishment) today houses the seat of the Manderscheid \"Verbandsgemeinde\" administration.\n\nThe \"Luziakirche\" (“Lucia’s Church”), also known as \"Luciakapelle\" (“Lucia’s Chapel”) – presumably the town's first church – stood in the Middle Ages on Manderscheid's northern outskirts. In 1386, Lucia von Manderscheid, Heinrich von Manderscheid's wife, was entombed there. About 1794, the chapel was burnt down by the French. The former location is now forsaken, that is to say, no remnants of the chapel are on hand anymore. Only a street name recalls its existence. From the \"Luciakapelle\" comes the image of the Sorrowful Mother, which is today found in Saint Hubert's Parish Church (\"Pfarrkirche St. Hubertus\"). The \"pietà\" come from the time about 1600; when it underwent restoration in the 1960s, traces of burning were still in evidence.\n\nOn 7 June 1969, the municipality of Niedermanderscheid, until this time self-administering, was amalgamated with Manderscheid. Since 16 January 1998, Manderscheid has been a town.\n\nThe council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:\nThe town's arms might be described thus: Or a fess dancetty gules, the shield ensigned with a crown of the field.\n\nThe \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Manderscheid was made up of almost the same individual municipalities as the old County of Manderscheid.\n\nWell known are Manderscheid's two castles, the Oberburg and the Niederburg. Also interesting to tourists are the gem grinding shop, the local history museum and the Maar Museum (about the Eifel's maars). Manderscheid lies on the river Lieser, which can be followed along the Eifel Club's trail, the \"Lieserpfad\", to Daun or Wittlich. Moreover, the 330 km-long “premium” hiking trail, the \"Eifelsteig\", leads through Manderscheid on its way from Aachen to Trier.\n\nThe traditional local speech is among the Moselle Franconian dialects. Besides some words that are not found in standard High German, there are the following peculiarities:\n\nUntil the mid 19th century, the \"Manderscheider Maß\" was the name given a standard dry measure in gristmills along the Lieser, Salm and Kleine Kyll (one was equal to 221.15 L). The so-called \"Malter-Maß\" was not the same everywhere, but rather varied regionally. The \"Manderscheider Maß\" was decreed in a \"Mühlenordnung\" (“mill order”) on 20 October 1736 by Prince-Archbishop-Elector Franz-Georg, and was valid for the whole of the Electorate of Trier.\n\nManderscheid lies on the Autobahn A 1.\n\n\n"}

The plants of this genus were described and introduced to Europeans by Georg Eberhard Rumphius. The common names for this genus are rushfoil and croton, but the latter also refers to \"Codiaeum variegatum\". The generic name comes from the Greek (\"\"), which means \"tick\" and refers to the shape of the seeds of certain species.\n\n\"Croton\" is a diverse and complex taxonomic group of plants ranging from herbs and shrubs to trees. A well-known member of this genus is \"Croton tiglium\", a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It was first mentioned in European literature by Cristóbal Acosta in 1578 as lignum pavanae. The oil, used in herbal medicine as a violent purgative, is extracted from its seeds. Nowadays, it is considered unsafe and it is no longer listed in the pharmacopeias of many countries.\n\n\"Croton tiglium\" oil has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat severe constipation, heal lesions, and is used as a purgative. It is a source of the organic compound phorbol and its tumor-promoting esters such as 12-\"O\"-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In the Amazon the red latex from the species \"Croton lechleri\", known as sangre de drago (dragon's blood), is used as a \"liquid bandage\", as well as for other medicinal purposes, by native peoples.\n\nCascarilla (\"C. eluteria\") bark is used to flavour the liquor Campari and Vermouth.\n\nIt has recently been shown in Kenya that \"Croton\" nuts, such as those from \"C. megalocarpus\", are a more economical source of biofuel than \"Jatropha\". In Kenya, Jatropha requires as much as 20,000 litres of water to make a litre of biofuel, while \"Croton\" trees grow wild and yield about .35 litres of oil per kilo of nuts. \"Croton\" trees are planted as a windbreak in Kenya and its use as a source of biofuel may benefit rural economies there. As arable land is under population pressure, people have been cutting down the windbreaks to expand farmland. This new use may save the windbreaks which should help fight desertification.\n\n\"Croton\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including \"Schinia citrinellus\", which feeds exclusively on the plant,\n\nThe genus is pantropical, with some species extending into temperate areas.\nIt is one of the largest and most complex genera of angiosperms in Madagascar, where up to 150 \"Croton\" species are endemic.\n\n"}

He studied \"Eigaku\" (\"English studies\") at the \"Kumamoto Yogakko\", and later at the \"Doshisha\" (subsequently Doshisha University) in Kyoto. He left school without graduating, but later wrote of his gratitude to the school's principal, Joseph Hardy Neesima.\n\nFollowing a period back in Kumamoto, where he started a local newspaper, Sohō moved to Tokyo. In 1887, he established the Min'yūsha publishing company, which printed Japan's first general news magazine, the \"Kokumin no Tomo\" (\"The People's Friend\") from 1887 to 1898. This magazine was highly influential in the politics of Meiji period Japan. In addition to this news magazine, the Min'yūsha also published a magazine of family issues, \"Katei Zasshi\" (\"Home Journal\", 1892–1898), an English-language version of the \"Kokumin no Tomo\", (\"The Far East\", 1896–1898), and an influential newspaper, the \"Kokumin Shinbun\" (1890–1929). \n\nSohō was initially a champion of liberal democracy and populism, as he felt that a free, open and democratic social and political order in emulation of the western nations in general, and the United States in particular would enable Japan to modernize and strengthen itself in the shortest possible time. His newspapers and magazines were a thorn in the side of the government during the first administration of Matsukata Masayoshi, criticizing the numerous corruption scandals of the time. However, following the First Sino-Japanese War and the Triple Intervention, his political views moved to the right of the political spectrum. By the second half of the 1890s, he came to be regarded as a conservative champion of the Meiji oligarchy, and was a close confidant of Prime Ministers Yamagata Aritomo and Katsura Tarō. By 1905, the \"Kokumin Shinbun\" was regarded as a government mouthpiece, and as such, its offices were targets of protesters during the Hibiya riots. \n\nIn 1910, Sohō founded the \"Keijō Nippō,\" one of the major Japanese newspapers in Korea under Japanese rule.\n\nWhile overseeing these publications as general editor, Sohō contributed some 350 articles, on diverse subjects ranging from international affairs, to history, biography and literature. He also compiled \"Kinsei Nihon Kokumin shi\" (\"A History of Early Modern Japan\"), which was published in 100 volumes over a period from 1918 to 1952. He was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1943.\n\nSohō was viewed with suspicion by the American occupation authorities, and was held under arrest during the occupation of Japan from December 1945 to August 1947 as a Class A War Criminal. The charges never came to trial (partly because of his age—he was 82 at the time), and he spent the time under house arrest at his villa in Atami. He continued to live in Atami until his death.\n\n\n"}

Lovecraft, written in early November 1920 and first published in the May 1922 issue of the \"Rainbow\". The title refers to a fictional city that later appears in Lovecraft's Dream Cycle, including his novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\" (1926).\n\nCelephaïs was created in a dream by Kuranes (which is his name in dreams—his real name is not given) as a child of the English landed gentry. As a man in his forties, alone and dispossessed in contemporary London, he dreams it again and then, seeking it, slowly slips away to the dream-world. Finally knights guide him through medieval England to his ancestral estate, where he spent his boyhood, and then to Celephaïs. He became the king and chief god of the city, though his body washes up by his ancestors' tower, now owned by a parvenu.\n\nIn \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\", Randolph Carter pays a visit to Kuranes, finding that the great dreamer has grown so homesick for his native Cornwall, he has dreamed parts of Celephaïs to resemble the land of his boyhood. Kuranes advises Carter, on a mission to find his own dream-city, to be careful what he wishes for—he might get it.\n\nLike many of Lovecraft's stories, \"Celephaïs\" was inspired by a dream, recorded in his commonplace book as \"Dream of flying over city.\"\n\nThe story resembles a tale by Lord Dunsany, \"The Coronation of Mr. Thomas Shap\" in \"The Book of Wonder\", in which the title character becomes more and more engrossed in his imaginary kingdom of Larkar until he begins to neglect business and routine tasks of daily living, and ultimately is placed in a madhouse. The imagery of the horses drifting off the cliff may derive from Ambrose Bierce's \"A Horseman in the Sky\" (1891).\n\nThe fictional village of Innsmouth in England is said to be based on the fishing town of Fleetwood, Lancashire which bears an uncanny resemblance to the description of the village in the later Shadow Over Innsmouth and its inhabitants\n\nIn the original short story, Celephaïs described as being situated in the valley of Ooth-Nargai beside the Cerenerian Sea. Its most remarkable feature is that it is unaffected by the passage of time, and takes no decay or wear, so that a person may leave it and return many years later to find that nothing has changed. \n\nImportant landmarks in Celephaïs are the turquoise temple of Nath-Horthath and the Street of Pillars. Nearby rises snow-capped Mount Aran, whose lower slopes are replete with ginkgo trees. Galleys from the port of Celephaïs go everywhere in the Dreamlands, but especially to the cloud-kingdom Serannian, reaching its harbor by sailing into the sky where the Cerenerian Sea meets the horizon.\n\n\n"}

Like most ICA algorithms, FastICA seeks an orthogonal rotation of prewhitened data, through a fixed-point iteration scheme, that maximizes a measure of non-Gaussianity of the rotated components. Non-gaussianity serves as a proxy for statistical independence, which is a very strong condition and requires infinite data to verify. FastICA can also be alternatively derived as an approximative Newton iteration.\n\nLet the formula_1 denote the input data matrix, formula_2 the number of columns corresponding with the number of samples of mixed signals and formula_3 the number of rows corresponding with the number of independent source signals. The input data matrix formula_4 must be \"prewhitened\", or centered and whitened, before applying the FastICA algorithm to it.\n\nformula_6 \nformula_16\nformula_21\n\nThe iterative algorithm finds the direction for the weight vector formula_22\nthat maximizes a measure of non-Gaussianity of the projection formula_23, \nwith formula_24 denoting a prewhitened data matrix as described above.\nNote that formula_25 is a column vector. To measure non-Gaussianity, FastICA relies on a nonquadratic nonlinear function formula_26, its first derivative formula_27, and its second derivative formula_28. Hyvärinen states that the functions \nformula_29\nare useful for general purposes, while \nformula_30 \nmay be highly robust. The steps for extracting the weight vector formula_25 for single component in FastICA are the following: \n\nThe single unit iterative algorithm estimates only one weight vector which extracts a single component. Estimating additional components that are mutually \"independent\" requires repeating the algorithm to obtain linearly independent projection vectors - note that the notion of independence here refers to maximizing non-Gaussianity in the estimated components. Hyvärinen provides several ways of extracting multiple components with the simplest being the following. Here, formula_37 is a column vector of 1's of dimension formula_2.\n\nAlgorithm FastICA\n\nIt is remarkable to note that Fast ICA is extremely robust to additive noise in the mixed signal. Consider the following noisy model.\nformula_55\nUpon Prewhitening formula_56 , the impact of the additive noise formula_57 on extraction is severely reduced. The Reconstruction ICA estimate of formula_58 , say formula_59 for two cases of high and low noise content is shown in the figure which clearly underscore the robustness of Fast ICA for additive noise.\n\n\n"}

His best known book, \"I Can Jump Puddles\" (1955) is the first of a three-part autobiography. The other two volumes are \"This is the Grass\" (1962) and \"In Mine Own Heart\" (1963).\n\nMarshall was born in Noorat, Victoria. At six years old he contracted polio, which left him with a physical disability that grew worse as he grew older. From an early age, he resolved to be a writer, and in \"I Can Jump Puddles\" he demonstrated an almost total recall of his childhood in Noorat. The characters and places of his book are thinly disguised from real life: \"Mount Turalla\" is Mount Noorat, \"Lake Turalla\" is Lake Keilambete, the \"Curruthers\" are the \"Blacks\", Mrs. Conlon is Mary Conlon of Dixie, Terang, and his best friend, \"Joe\" from the books, is Leo Carmody.\nAustralian poet and contemporary, Hal Porter wrote in 1965 that Marshall was:\n\"... the warmest and most centralized human being ... To walk with ease and nonchalance the straight, straight line between appearing tragic and appearing willfully brave is a feat so complex I should not like to have to rake in the dark for the super-bravery to accomplish it.\"During the early 1930s Marshall worked as an accountant at the Trueform Boot and Shoe Company, Clifton Hill and later wrote about life in the factory in his novel \"How beautiful are Thy Feet\", 1949.\nMarshall wrote numerous short stories, mainly set in the bush.

A ZX Spectrum version was produced but never released. The game itself was developed by Laurens van der Donk in the Netherlands who was involved in the Demoscene being in both Boys Without Brains (BWB) and Hotline.\n\nThe music was put together by developers Maniacs of Noise. The original C64 music is composed by Johannes Bjerregaard with an exception of a loader music which was composed by Reyn Ouwehand (he later released a remix of this song). Charles Deenen arranged Amiga version's music which follows Bjerregaard's original.\n\nThe mad scientist Fransz Dandruff has created a machine that draws the life energy from its victim for him, thus extending his life indefinitely. Dandruff kidnaps Pearly, beauty queen of Dewdropland, to provide this energy. Her boyfriend Flimbo sets out to save her.\n\nThe player controls Flimbo through seven distinct levels, collecting scrolls for the wizard Dazz Bazian, to allow him to create a spell that will send Flimbo to the next level. The levels are free-roaming, and some exploration is necessary to find the scrolls from enemies dotted around the lair, as well as other secrets such as banks and various power-ups: a super weapon, which extends the range and power of Flimbo's shooting enabling longshots to be fired across the screen, invulnerability which lasts for 30 seconds—this does not protect from water or holes—and in level 6, hourglasses which add 2 minutes to the time limit. All of these can be bought in Dazz's shops, along with individual letters or complete words of the code. Hearts can also be obtained in 5 colours to give the player an extra life, again these can be taken from enemies in the game.\n\n\"Flimbo's Quest\" takes place over seven levels: a normal rural landscape, a fishing village, a mountain landscape, a weird alien world, a forest, a graveyard and Fransz Dandruff's laboratory. There are two different background musics, which alternate between the levels.\n\nAlthough there are essentially only a few different types of enemy in each level, there is a further and more frustrating distinction to be made by the player, in terms of location on the level. In level 5 for example, it may be required to kill an antelope, but it isn't possible to tell from the mugshot alone where in the level it is (an enemy carrying a scroll will flash on the 8-bit versions, or have an arrow on top of it on the Amiga and Atari ST versions). It has also been discovered that there is a maximum amount of money to get in any level, assuming that the player kills enough enemies on each part of the screen, though with the stringent time limit this is inadvisable.\n\nEach level provides 2 or 3 secret power-ups, which can be activated by simultaneously firing and ducking in the right places; generally in less frequented positions, which can be used to quickly finish the level. Among the power-ups available are superscrolls, item upgrade (free heart/heart to scroll/scroll to superscroll), 2 minutes extra time, and a \"smart bomb\" which will destroy all enemies on and just outside the boundaries of the screen.\n\nAt the end of level seven, the letters that Flimbo has collected are revealed to be assembly language instructions, and are programmed into Dandruff's computer to free Pearly. When the game is completed, it restarts from the beginning with the time count, money, lives, hearts (if any) and score that the player had at the end of the game.\n\nThe video gaming press gave \"Flimbo's Quest\" a lukewarm reception as standard and unoriginal platform fare. However, the C64 version achieved a high level of distribution thanks to the game being distributed on a cartridge with four games on it, distributed in the early 90s with the Commodore 64. The cartridge was also distributed with the ill-fated Commodore 64 Games System console (also known as the C64GS).\n\nBecause of the \"cartoony\" font the title \"\"Flimbo's Quest\"\" was written on the game disk, and the hard-to-read brown-on-blue colours, it was often misread as \"\"Fumbo's Quest\"\" with the \"L\" and \"I\" merging into a \"U\". Some software retailers even marketed the game with this name.\n\n"}

{"id": "1977149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977149", "title": "Azpeitia", "text": "Azpeitia\n\nAzpeitia (meaning 'down the rock' in Basque) is a town and municipality within the province of Gipuzkoa, in the Basque Country of Spain, located on the Urola river a few kilometres east of Azkoitia. Its population is 14,580 (2014). It is located 41 kilometres southwest of Donostia/San Sebastián.\n\nAzpeitia is the birthplace of Ignatius of Loyola. The house of his birth is now preserved as a part of large Jesuit compound, the Sanctuary of Loyola, a major attraction of tourists and pilgrims alike. It is also the birthplace of Renaissance composer Juan de Anchieta.\n\nAzpeitia lies at the foot of the massive Izarraitz towering over the town and much visited by the townspeople. Azpeitia Railway Museum is located in the town.\n\nAzpeitia was incorporated in 1310 by a royal decree of King Fernando IV. Its original name was “Garmendia de Iraurgi” and a year later it was renamed “Salvatierra de Iraurgi”. The name “Azpeitia” is first found in 1397.\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries there were many battles and wars among prominent families in the town, especially between the Oñatz and Gamboa families.\nIn 1766, there was revolt in the town against King Carlos V's policy of liberalizing the selling and buying of wheat and a rebellious town council was briefly established. However, the revolt was quickly suppressed by troops sent from San Sebastian.\n\nThe steel and wood industries have historically been the main industries in Azpeitia. The Sanctuary of Loyola is its major local tourist attraction, together with the Basque Railway Museum.\n\nHe was born in Loyola, Azpeitia, in 1491 and died in Rome in 1556. His family was part of the aristocracy of Biscay. As a young man he worked in the service of the viceroy of Navarre. He was injured in both legs during the defence of Pamplona in 1521. Afterwards, during his convalescence, he started reading religious books. This had a big impact on his life. He then travelled to Catalonia, first to the monastery of Montserrat in 1522 and then to Manresa, where he retired to a cave to meditate for a year. Afterwards he wrote his most famous book, the \"Book of Spiritual Exercises\" (\"Libro de los Ejercicios Espirituales\"). \n\nAfter various journeys to Rome, Barcelona, Alcalá de Henares and Salamanca, he went to Paris in 1528, where he studied philosophy and theology. Together with some other students he founded the core of the Society of Jesus, which received Papal approval in 1540 and chose St Ignatius as its superior general. Afterwards, the Jesuits spread all over the world, starting in Europe and then to the Americas. When he died, St Ignatius was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church .\n\nThe museum is situated in the old Urola railway station, on a line which connected Zumaia and Zumárraga. \nThe Basque Railway Museum has one of the best railway collections in Europe, with vehicles of all types: steam locomotives, diesel and electric; automotive and different kinds of cars.\n\nIn addition, the museum offers one of the most complete sets of machine tools in the Basque Country from the old Urola Railway garage. This installation is preserved just as it was inaugurated in 1925, with an old electric motor that drives its 16 machines through a complex system of pulleys and belts. This line is no longer operated as a service. However, the train between Azpeitia and Lasao is an important tourist attraction.\n\nThe amazing facilities of the old electrical transformer plant with its original equipment rectification, mercury vapor, reflect the most modern technology of a century ago.\n\nOn the first floor of the central building of the old station at Azpeitia, there is an exceptional sample of the uniforms used in the railroads since the late nineteenth century to the AVE. On the second floor is a great collection of railway clocks. Nowadays, the train museum is operated by Eusko Tren, a public railway company run by the Basque government.\n\nA recent study supported by the Basque government, \"Azpeitia 1936-1945\" examines daily life in the period and an index of Azpeitians of the time with a summary of their political activities during and after the Civil War. It also contains reproductions of many of the historical documents of the time.\n\nIn Azpeitia, the main opposing sides were the Carlists (carlistas), who supported the Nationalists, and the Basque Nationalists from EAJ-PNV(supporting the Republicans). There were also falangists and left-wing militants (from UGT and Izquierda Republicana) and some anarchists. \nNationalist troops entered Azpeitia in September, 1936. Shortly afterwards, a new council was created dominated by Carlists and traditionalists.\n\nAzpeita has always been characterized by a wide use of the Basque language (Euskara), but its use diminished after Franco's victory. Franco himself visited Azpeitia in 1939 and in 1945 (he visited the Loyola Sanctuary, notably).\n\nIts building process started in 1320. It was the property of one of the most powerful Basque families of the time, the Oñatz family. In 1456, the upper part of the tower was destroyed by order of Henry IV. It was repaired in 1535. In 1750, numerous baroque elements typical of the time were added and the tower, now a palace, acquired its current appearance. Nowadays, the palace is Azpeitia's local public library.\n\nIt is situated halfway between Azpeitia and Loyola. It was built in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. It contains a polychrome Gothic carving of Our Lady of Olatz, for whom it is said that San Ignatius felt a special devotion. The private boards of Gipuzkoa held their meetings here until the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1535, after completing his studies in Paris, when Íñigo de Loyola (Saint Ignatius) arrived in Azpeitia, he was ill. However, instead of residing in the family tower house, he chose to stay in this hospital and leprosarium, together with the poorest patients. He used to preach there. He also is said to have walked the streets begging for food and help for those who were ill, homeless and unprotected. Nowadays, the old hospital is used as an Ignatian interpretation centre.\n\nBuilt by the Templars between the 16th and 18th centuries, it underwent extensive restructuring and only the tower of the old temple was conserved. The original portico was replaced in 1771 with a frontispiece designed by Francisco Ibero. The church has eight chapels in total. The Baroque altarpiece and the baptismal font where Íñigo de Loyola was Christianized are of outstanding beauty.\n\n\nTourism leaflet about Azpeitia (2015)\n\n"}

{"id": "1977174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977174", "title": "Basic Instinct 2", "text": "Basic Instinct 2\n\nBasic Instinct 2 (also known as Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction) is a 2006 erotic thriller film and the sequel to 1992's \"Basic Instinct\". The film was directed by Michael Caton-Jones and produced by Mario Kassar, Joel B. Michaels and Andrew G. Vajna. The screenplay was by Leora Barish and Henry Bean. It stars Sharon Stone, who reprises her role of crime mystery author Catherine Tramell (from the original \"Basic Instinct\"), and David Morrissey. The film is an international co-production of Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain producers.\n\nThe film follows novelist and suspected serial killer Catherine Tramell, who is once again in trouble with the authorities, this time in Britain in London. Now Scotland Yard (Greater London's Metropolitan Police Service) appoints psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass to evaluate her after. As with SFPD Detective Nick Curran in the first film, Dr. Glass becomes a victim of Tramell's seductive but psychological games.\n\nAfter being in development limbo for several years, the sequel film was finally shot in London from April to August 2005, and was released on 31 March 2006. Following numerous cuts, it was released with an R rating for \"strong sexuality, nudity, violence, language, and some drug content\". Unlike its predecessor, the film received negative reviews and fell short of commercial expectations.\n\nSet in London, the film opens with American best-selling author Catherine Tramell in a speeding car with her companion, Kevin Franks, a famous English football (soccer / rugby) star. Tramell takes the man's hand and begins masturbating herself with it, all the while increasing her vehicle's speed. At the point of orgasm, Tramell veers off the road and crashes into the West India Docks in Canary Wharf on the Thames River. She attempts to save her partner but, as she says while being questioned later by the police, \"When it came down to it, I guess my life was more important to me than his\".\n\nTramell is interrogated by Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Roy Washburn, who notes that D-Tubocurarine (DTC), which is a neuromuscular blocking agent used to relax muscles during general anaesthesia for medical surgery, was found in her car and in her companion's body, and the companion was not breathing at the time of the crash, (according to the autopsy), and that a man named \"Dicky Pep\" said that he sold Tramell \"15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday\". Tramell counters by saying that this Dicky Pep must be lying because \"you've got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out, if he even exists\".\n\nTramell begins therapy sessions with Dr. Michael Glass, who has conducted a court-ordered psychiatric exam and given testimony in her case. Dr. Glass strongly suspects that Tramell is a narcissist incapable of telling the difference between right and wrong. Tramell begins to play mind games with Glass, who becomes increasingly frustrated and intrigued by her. Meanwhile, the journalist boyfriend of Glass's ex-wife, who was in the process of writing a story critical of Glass, is found strangled to death. More murders begin to surface around Dr. Glass, including his own ex-wife, as his obsession with Tramell grows and when his career and life are threatened; he begins to suspect that Tramell is really committing the murders and attempting to frame him for them. Glass increasingly cannot distinguish himself between right and wrong, and the London police begin to suspect him. He confronts Tramell at her apartment where they engage in passionate sex. Tramell gives Glass a copy of the draft of her next novel, titled \"The Analyst\". After reading it, he realises that Tramell has novelised most of the recent events with herself and Glass as characters. A character based on Glass's female colleague, Dr. Milena Gardosh, is depicted as the next murder victim in the novel.\n\nGlass runs to Dr. Gardosh's apartment to warn her, finding Tramell already there. Gardosh informs him that he is no longer in charge of Tramell's therapy and that his license will be revoked. Glass and Gardosh struggle, and she is knocked unconscious. Tramell then threatens Glass with a gun she carries, but Glass takes it away from her. When Detective Superintendent Washburn arrives at the scene, Tramell manipulates Dr. Glass into shooting him.\n\nIn the final scene, Tramell pays a visit to Dr. Glass now at a local mental hospital where he has been institutionalised, and he learns from her that the novel has become a best-seller. Tramell claims that she manipulated Glass into committing all those murders, and flashbacks are shown of Glass committing the murders. Tramell leaves with a smirk on her face, while Glass continues to sit silently in his wheelchair.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 6% based on 154 reviews and an average rating of 3.02/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Unable to match the suspense and titilation of its predecessor, \"Basic Instinct 2\" boasts a plot so ludicrous and predictable it borders on so-bad-it's-good.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 26 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nBBC film critic Mark Kermode gave it a positive review.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4, but nonetheless gave a qualified recommendation of the film despite its flaws.\n\nAt the 27th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film (dubbed by the ceremony as \"Basically, It Stinks, Too\") won four Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Sharon Stone), Worst Prequel or Sequel, and Worst Screenplay (Leora Barish and Henry Bean). It also earned nominations for Worst Director (Michael Caton-Jones), Worst Supporting Actor (David Thewlis), and Worst Screen Couple (Sharon Stone's lopsided breasts).\n\nThe film was a noteworthy failure at the box office. The film grossed only $3,201,420 (averaging just $2,203 per theater) in its first weekend of release in the United States. This placed it a poor 10th in top gross, against such competition as \"\" (opening the same weekend), \"V for Vendetta\" and \"Inside Man\". Low as the opening weekend was, the second week drop-off was just under 70% to just $1,017,607, averaging a mere $700 per theatre, nearly the worst of the year. (Only \"Harsh Times\" and \"Eragon\" dropped off more.) In the end, the film was in theatres for only 17 days before Sony decided to stop tracking its progress, and finished with a domestic gross of only $5,971,336.\n\nThe film found more success outside the United States, earning $32,658,142, giving \"Basic Instinct 2\" a worldwide theatrical gross of $38,629,478.\n\nMoviefone ranked the film as No. 16 on its \"Top 25 Box Office Bombs of All Time\".\n\nPlans for a third film have been scrapped due to the film's poor box office reception. However, in April 2006, Stone said she'd be interested in directing a potential third installment.\n\n"}

{"id": "1977192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977192", "title": "The Spotlight Kid", "text": "The Spotlight Kid\n\nThe Spotlight Kid is the sixth studio album by Captain Beefheart. Released in 1972, it is the only album credited solely to Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) rather than Beefheart and the Magic Band. Often cited as one of the most accessible of Beefheart's albums, it is solidly founded in the blues but also uses instruments such as marimba and jingle bells that are not typical of that genre. The incarnation of the Magic Band on this album was Bill Harkleroad and Elliot Ingber, guitars; Mark Boston, bass; John French, drums; and Art Tripp, marimba. Session drummer Rhys Clark substituted for French on one track, \"Glider\".\n\nIn the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California, and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing \"Trout Mask Replica\". According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalled being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.\n\nDuring the recording sessions the band recorded several compositions that did not appear on the released album. \"Well, Well, Well\", with Mark Boston on vocals, was the only one that was completed. The rest were sketches or early versions of songs, some of which were recorded and released on later albums. \"Suzy Murder Wrist\" was later completed as \"Sue Egypt\" on \"Doc at the Radar Station\", and \"The Witch Doctor Life\" later appeared on \"Ice Cream for Crow\". \"Drink Paint Run Run\" was an early version (with completely different lyrics) of \"Ice Cream for Crow\".\n\nThe music on \"The Spotlight Kid\" is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original \"Trout Mask Replica\" and the frenetic \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\". This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous three years – at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he \"got tired of scaring people with what I was doing ... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music.\" Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the faster instrumental backing of the earlier albums. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that he almost never rehearsed with the group.\n\nContemporary reviews were generally favorable. Lester Bangs described the album as appealing to a \"new audience, the ones that teethed on feedback and boogie\", acknowledging that Beefheart's previous work was \"a bit beyond the attention span or interest of the average listener\". Critic Robert Christgau graded the album as a B+ though he felt that Beefheart's \"much-bruited commercial bid turns out to have all the mass appeal of \"King of the Delta Blues Singers\"\". \n\"Stereo Review\" acknowledged the album as Beefheart's attempt to \"go commercial\", while opining that \"Captain's conception of commercial is still sweetly weird\". Colman Andrews writing in \"Phonograph Record Magazine\" described the album as evidence that Van Vliet was \"the greatest white blues singer in America today\". Jim Washburn, reviewing the album's reissue as a double CD with \"Clear Spot\", noted that while \"Beefheart seemed to be attempting to meet listeners halfway\" the music was still \"demanding, powerful stuff\". Later assessments were less positive. Critic and Beefheart biographer Mike Barnes has offered that the album was \"ponderous ... it really just lumbers along. You get the feeling that if the tracks were about half as fast again it would add a bit more energy.\"\n\"New Musical Express\" described the album as \"manic depressive\".\n\nDespite being nominated as \"Melody Maker\" album of the month \"The Spotlight Kid\" failed to match the UK Top 20 success of \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\", peaking at . However, in the US it was the first Captain Beefheart album to appear in the \"Billboard\" Top 200. Its peak of remains the highest attained by any Beefheart album. The album is now available as a \"two for one\" CD along with Beefheart's follow-up album, \"Clear Spot\". Separately, the two albums are available as vinyl LP reissues. Van Vliet later blamed the album's lack of success on the band members, stating, \"The band wasn't into what I wanted to do at the time ... They failed miserably on \"The Spotlight Kid.\"\" The tendency to take full credit for successes while blaming any failures on band members was typical of Beefheart, as related in John French's book, \"Beefheart: Through the Eye of Magic\".\n\nThe band members disliked the simple material and sluggish tempos. Drummer John French has said, \"At the time I \"hated\" that album ... A lot of that stuff was really boring to play, because it was so simple and it wasn't going anywhere. For another thing a lot of the tracks were just so slow ... We just hated it.\" Guitarist Bill Harkleroad simply said \"I hate that album. It sucks.\" He attributed the album's lackluster performances to the emotional toll of Van Vliet's behavior toward the band: \"We were just emotionally beat to death by his particular environment... we were playing really anemically and it sucks because of that.\"\n\nBlack Francis of the Pixies cited \"The Spotlight Kid\" as one of the albums he listened to regularly when first writing songs for the band.\n\nAll songs written by Don Van Vliet except where noted.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1977196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977196", "title": "Martyrdom of Polycarp", "text": "Martyrdom of Polycarp\n\nMartyrdom of Polycarp is a manuscript written in the form of a letter that relates the religious martyrdom of Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna (the site of the modern city of Izmir, Turkey) and disciple of John the Apostle in the 2nd centuryAD. It forms the earliest account of Christian martyrdom outside of the New Testament. The author of \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" is unknown, but it has been attributed to members of the group of early Christian theologians known as the Church Fathers. The letter, sent from the church in Smyrna to another church in Asia Minor at Philomelium, is partly written from the point of view of an eye-witness, recounting the arrest of the elderly Polycarp, the Romans' attempt to execute him by fire, and subsequent miraculous events.\n\nThe letter takes influence from both Jewish martyrdom texts in the Old Testament and the Gospels. Furthermore, the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" promotes an ideology of martyrdom, by delineating the proper conduct of a martyr.\n\nModern critical editions of the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" (\"MartPol\") are compiled from three different categories of manuscript: seven Greek manuscripts, the fourth century \"Ecclesiastical History\" of Eusebius of Caesarea, and a single Latin manuscript. The Greek manuscripts are all from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries. Of the seven manuscripts, six provide a similar account of the martyrdom of Polycarp and are thus believed to represent a single family of texts. The seventh manuscript, however, known as the Moscow Codex and dating to the thirteenth century, contains a more elaborate final chapter (22.2–3).\n\nIn addition to the Greek manuscripts there are also the writings of Eusebius related in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", written around AD 324–325. Eusebius heavily summarizes the martyrdom and ends his account at 19.1, omitting the concluding sections that relate the transmission of the text, as well as the passion narrative parallels.\n\nThe Latin version of the \"Martyrdom\" dating from the tenth century exists as an independent account of the martyrdom but does not offer any variance upon the text. There is also an Old Church Slavonic translation that serves as an independent witness.\n\nLittle corroborating evidence exists to assist in the dating of the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\". Alternatively, historians have attempted to assign a date to the actual death of Polycarp. Three dates have been proposed for Polycarp's death:\n\nThe \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\", along with other documents of the Apostolic Fathers plays a central role in bridging the New Testament and emerging Christian writers in the latter half of the second century, such as Justin Martyr and Irenaeus. In his youth he is said to have known the apostles and in his later years also Irenaeus.\n\nA challenge to the dates could well call into question the authenticity of the document itself. Part of the skepticism regarding the MartPol text has centered on the number of parallels with the passion narratives of the Gospels, including Polycarp's prediction of his capture and death (5.2), the eirenarch named Herod (6.2), the arrest of Polycarp \"with weapons as if he were a criminal\" (7.1), and Polycarp being carried on a donkey back to Smyrna (8.1), miraculous occurrences such as the ‘voice from heaven’ urging Polycarp to ‘Be strong and be a man!’ (9.1). On the other hand, the fact of an overlay of interpretation does not necessarily in itself invalidate the historicity. Moreover, none of these elements is completely implausible; the name Herod, for example, is a common name for an aristocratic Jew and the association of Christians with donkeys is well documented.\n\nSome have maintained that the most difficult aspect of the narrative to accept as authentic is its treatment of Roman legal proceedings. In fact, Polycarp's trial is represented as taking place before one of the leading magistrates of the Empire on a public holiday, in the middle of a sport stadium, with no use of the tribunal, no formal legal accusation, and no official sentence. Though the trials of Christians, and of all subjects for that matter, were certainly subject to the governor's procedural method of \"cognitio extra ordinem\", some feel that this still does not explain the lack of a formal legal accusation and sentence. This line of argumentation against historicity could be all the more serious in so far as Roman capital trial procedure would presumably have been well known to the population of the time.\nSome have proposed that the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" is in fact a theological composition designed to support a particular understanding of martyrdom in relation to the Christian Gospel, among the elements cited being biblical parallelism, perceived apologia for lack of surviving relics, appearance of the expression 'Catholic church', the behavior of Quintus, the inventio-styled epigrams, and a clear preoccupation with the status of the martyrs. Some have gone so far as to suggest a late date for the composition of the text, perhaps in the first half of third century. \n\nThe \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" is recognized as taking on two literary forms. It is simultaneously considered to be a letter as well as a martyr act.\n\nThe construction of the text follows a letter format. Specifically it is a letter sent by the church in Smyrna to the church in Philomelium but was meant to be circulated to all the congregations of the region. The letter abides by the following structure: an initial greeting and blessing (1.1-2), followed by the body of material about the story of Polycarp's death (5.1-18.3), and a closing afterwards (19.1-20.2). By the second century, the authority of Paul the apostle and his letters to the congregations has already been established. Thus the letterform was well recognized and used in early Christian literature.\n\nThe \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" is also the earliest of the martyr acts as a genre in the ancient Christian tradition. This martyrdom theme enters Christian literature through the early Jewish martyrs' literature found in 2 Maccabees 6–7, in the Old Testament, and through the account of the death of Stephen in Acts 7 in the New Testament. The motifs of complete surrendering of will, and a steadfast behavior in the face of suffering are common in these acts would become popular events in the mindset of Christians who were persecuted.\n\nGerd Buschmann gives the following outline of the MartPol \n\nInscr Inscriptio of the Letter—expanded to \"Diaspora Circular\"\n\"1.1-2 Theme of the letter—Polycarp as example of martyr’s deeds in line with the gospel.\"\n2-4 The example of the noble martyrs of Christ\n2.1-4 Praise for the example of the noble martyrs of Christ\n3.1-2 The one way: the positive example of the steadfast Germanicus\n4 The other way: the negative example of the Phrygian Quintus—The urge for martyrdom.\n5.1-18.3 The admirable example of the by-the-gospel martyrdom of Polycarp\n5.1-2 Polycarp's flight from martyrdom and the prediction of his death\n6.1-2 Polycarp's arrest: The causes\n7.1-3 Polycarp's arrest: The capture\n8.1-3 Polycarp's temptation and steadfastness on the way to martyrdom. \n\"9.1-11.2 Polycarp’s Trial\"\n9.1 Polycarp strengthening through the wondrous voice from heaven\n9.2-3 Beginning of the trial: Question of identity, temptation to recant, order to swear, and steadfastness\n10.1-2 Middle of the Trial: Acknowledgement of being Christian\n\"11.1-2 End of the Trial: Threats and steadfastness\"\n12.1-14.3 Preparation for the execution of Polycarp\n12.1-3 Reactions to the trial and the instigation of the Jews and Gentiles\n13.1-3 Polycarp's behavior in the face of the stake\n14.1-3 Polycarp's prayer at the stake\n\"15.1-16.2 Polycarp’s Execution: Burning, dying, and wonder (admiration)\"\n15.1-2 The burning: The fire at the stake and its miraculous behavior\n16.1-2 Wonder and admiration at the burning\n17.1-18.3 Polycarp's remains\n17.1-3 Polycarp's remains and the questions of the relationship between veneration of martyrs and of Christ\n18.1-3 Collection and burial of the bones of Polycarp for the celebration of the anniversary of his death\n19.1-20.2 Closing of the Letter\n19.1-2 Theme of the Letter: Polycarp's meaning as example of a martyr's behavior in accordance with the gospel—a summation\n20.1-2 Closing—expanded to “diaspora circular”\n21.1-22.3 Appendices\n21 Appendix 1: Chronological appendix on the day of Polycarp's death\n22.1 Appendix 2: Postscript of exhortation to the imitation of Polycarp's example\n22.2 Appendix 3a: History of the tradition of the copyists and their copies\n22.3 Appendix 3b:Securing the tradition of MartPol\n\nIn addition to attempting to edify its audience, the MartPol advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp's death as its prized example. The letter begins with an opposition of two martyr examples in which one is marked as good, and the other as bad. \nThese examples can be found in sections 2-4 of the letter, where the noble Germanicus of Smyrna is praised for his steadfast example, as well the example of Quintus who expressed an urge for martyrdom and sought it out. Polycarp thus serves as a testimony of proper discipleship and imitation of the Lord in his martyrdom.\n\n“Blessed and noble, therefore, are all the martyrdoms that have occurred according to the will of God. For we must be reverent and attribute the ultimate authority to God.” (2.1)\n\nParallels with the passion narrative of Jesus Christ provide validation and value to the death of Polycarp. This imitatio Christi comes to be central to this ideology of martyrdom. It is thus the completion of this imitation through death, as did Christ, that makes the witness a martyr.\n\nThe author of the \"Martyrdom\" displays significant knowledge of the scriptures. Beginning with the case of the Old Testament which is rooted in Jewish martyr history. In regards to the New Testament we find more references. The most prominent among them being the blessing at the end of the introduction (parallel to Jude 2), the charge to think always of others in 1.2 (parallel to Philippians 2:4), the recollection of the mystical visions of the martyrs in 2.3 (parallel to 1 Corinthians 2:9), the warning that Christians should not seek martyrdom in 4.1 (parallel to Matthew 10:23), the account of Polycarp's submission to the authorities in 7.1 (parallel to Acts 21:14) and finally the observation that governing authorities receive their power from God in 10.2 (parallel to Romans 13:1 and 1 Peter 2:13-14). \nMost important, especially in the general structuring and treatment of the martyrdom, is its parallel to the gospels. These examples are extensive and include:\n\nSuch correspondence between these events and those of the canonical passion narratives might cast doubt on the former's historical veracity. Other scholars have argued that it is difficult to establish dependence on particular New Testament texts and have pointed to the influence of Greek philosophy and early Christian Biblical interpretation on the account. \n\n\n\n"}

For Wallachia, the victory meant an increase in morale and the further evolution of the independent state.\n\nSome historians claim that the Cumans aided the Wallachians in the battle. Still in the Hungarian army there was a substantial Cuman-Hungarian contingent so this variant is very improbable. In 1324, Wallachia was a vassal of Hungary, and Robert referred to Basarab as \"our Transalpine Voivode\".\n\nThe war started with encouragement from the Voivode of Transylvania and a certain Dionisie, who later bore the title Ban of Severin. In 1330, Robert captured the long disputed Wallachian citadel of Severin and handed it to the Transylvanian Voivode.\n\nBasarab sent envoys who asked for the hostilities to cease, and in return offered to pay 7,000 marks in silver, submit the fortress of Severin to Robert, and send his own son as hostage. According to the \"Viennese Illuminated Chronicle\", a contemporary account, Robert said about Basarab: \"He is the shepherd of my sheep, and I will take him out of his mountains, dragging him by his beard.\" Another account writes that Robert said that: \"...he will drag the Voivode from his cottage, as would any driver his oxen or shepherd his sheep.\"\n\nThe King's councillors begged him to accept the offer or give a milder reply, but he refused and led his 30,000-strong army deeper into Wallachia \"without proper supplies or adequate reconnaissance\". Basarab was unable to stand a battle in the open field against a large army, due to the poor state of his troops, and he decided to retreat somewhere into the Transylvanian Alps.\n\nRobert entered Curtea de Argeș, the main city of the Wallachian state. He realised that Basarab had fled into the mountains and decided to give chase.\n\nThe location of the battle is still debated among historians. One theory gives the location of the battle at Loviştea, in some mountain gorges, in the valley of Olt, Transylvania. However, Romanian historian Neagu Djuvara denies this and states that the location of the battle was somewhere at the border between Oltenia and Severin.\n\nThe Wallachian army, led by Basarab himself, probably numbered less than 10,000 men and consisted of cavalry, infantry archers, and some locally recruited peasants. When Robert saw his best knights being killed, without being able to fight back, while the escape routes were blocked by the Wallachian cavalry, he gave his royal robes and insignia to one of his captains – \"who dies under a hail of arrows and stones\" – and, with a few loyal subjects, made a difficult escape to Visegrád \"clad in dirty civilian clothes\".\n\nRobert later recounted in detail, in a charter of December 13, 1335, how one \"Nicholas, son of Radoslav\", saved his life by defending him from the swords of five Wallachian warriors, giving him enough time to escape. Most of the Hungarian army – which included many nobles – was destroyed; among the casualties were the Voivode of Transylvania and the priest who accompanied the king.\n\nThe victory represented the survival of the Wallachian state, as well as the beginning of a period of tense relations between Basarab and the Kingdom of Hungary, which lasted until 1344, when Basarab sent his son Alexandru in order to re-establish a relationship between the two states.\n\nBecause of its large financial power, the Kingdom of Hungary quickly rebuilt its army and found itself in conflict with the Holy Roman Empire in 1337. However, the Hungarian king maintained a \"de jure\" suzerainty over Wallachia until the diplomatic disputes had been resolved.\n\n"}

It spans the time between 152.1 ± 4 Ma and 145.0 ± 4 Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the Kimmeridgian and followed by the Berriasian stage (part of the Cretaceous).\n\nThe Tithonian was introduced in scientific literature by German stratigrapher Albert Oppel in 1865. The name Tithonian is unusual in geological stage names because it is derived from Greek mythology. Tithonus was the son of Laomedon of Troy. He fell in love with Eos, the Greek goddess of dawn and finds his place in the stratigraphy because this stage, the Tithonian, finds itself hand in hand with the dawn of the Cretaceous.\n\nThe base of the Tithonian stage is at the base of the ammonite biozone of \"Hybonoticeras hybonotum\". A global reference profile (a GSSP or golden spike) for the base of the Tithonian had in 2009 not yet been established.\n\nThe top of the Tithonian stage (the base of the Berriasian stage and the Cretaceous system) is marked by the first appearance of small globular calpionellids of the species \"Calpionella alpina\", at the base of the Alpina Subzone .\n\nThe Tithonian is often subdivided into Lower/Early, Middle and Upper/Late substages or subages. The Late Tithonian is coeval with the Portlandian stage of British stratigraphy.\n\nThe Tithonian stage contains seven ammonite biozones in the Tethys domain, from top to base:\n\nIn the ocean of Tethys, the Tithonian has a calcareous facies with a typical cephalopod fauna. The Solnhofen limestone of southern Germany, which is known for its fossils (especially \"Archaeopteryx\"), is of Tithonian age.\n\n\n"}

The Aphaiwongs were of royal Khmer lineage. Khuang attended Debsirin School and Assumption College, Bangkok, later studying engineering at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon in France. On his return to Thailand, he worked in the telegraph department, finally becoming director of the department. This earned him the feudal title \"Luang Kowit-aphaiwong\". He married Lekha Kunadilok (Goone-Tilleke), daughter of Ceylon-born lawyer William Alfred Goone-Tilleke, founder of the law firm Tilleke & Gibbins.\n\nKhuang was a member of the civil faction of \"Khana Ratsadon\" (\"People's Party\"), the group that promoted the Siamese revolution of 1932, that brought a regime change from absolute to constitutional monarchy. Afterwards, he served as minister without portfolio in the cabinets of Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena and Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun). During World War II he was commissioned a major and joined the King's Guard. As such he was at the head of the mission to Battambang which in July 1941 took control of the Cambodian territories occupied during the Franco-Thai War, to be renamed Phra Tabong Province. His father had been governor of part of this region before it was ceded to France 1907. Later he became minister of commerce and communications.\n\nOn 1 August 1944, parliament elected him prime minister, after Phibun's plans to move the capital to Phetchabun and to create the Phutthamonthon Park failed to gain approval. He was a compromise candidate, standing between the Phibun supporters and the opposition Free Thai Movement. Ostensibly he co-operated with the Japanese who had occupied Thailand during the war. At the same time, he shielded the Free Thai who collaborated with the Allies. After the Japanese retreat he resigned on 31 August 1945, to make way for a new administration by the Free Thai forces.\n\nIn 1946 he was one of the founders of the conservative Democrat Party, and became its first leader. The fourth national elections on 6 January 1946 were won by the Democratic Party, which gained him a second term as prime minister starting on 31 January. Only 45 days later, on 24 March, his government lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament and he resigned.\n\nHe became prime minister a third time on 10 November 1947 following a coup d'état led by Field Marshal Phin Chunhawan. However, the coup leaders were not pleased with the performance of Khuang's government and forced him to resign on 8 April 1948. This enabled Phibun to become prime minister again. Khuang continued in politics as the opposition leader and leader of the Democratic Party until all political parties were banned in 1958. His wife, Khunying Lekha Aphaiwong, was appointed senator in 1949, becoming one of the first female politicians of Thailand.\n\nKhuang died on 15 March 1968, at age 66.\n\n"}

Codd in 1968. It was designed to recreate the computation- and construction-universality of von Neumann's CA but with fewer states: 8 instead of 29. Codd showed that it was possible to make a self-reproducing machine in his CA, in a similar way to von Neumann's universal constructor, but never gave a complete implementation.\n\nIn the 1940s and '50s, John von Neumann posed the following problem:\nHe was able to construct a cellular automaton with 29 states, and with it a universal constructor. Codd, building on von Neumann's work, found a simpler machine with eight states. This modified von Neumann's question:\n\nThree years after Codd's work, Edwin Roger Banks showed a 4-state CA in his PhD thesis that was also capable of universal computation and construction, but again did not implement a self-reproducing machine. John Devore, in his 1973 masters thesis, tweaked Codd's rules to greatly reduce the size of Codd's design, to the extent that it could be implemented in the computers of that time. However, the data tape for self-replication was too long; Devore's original design was later able to complete replication using Golly. Christopher Langton made another tweak to Codd's cellular automaton in 1984 to create Langton's loops, exhibiting self-replication with far fewer cells than that needed for self-reproduction in previous rules, at the cost of removing the ability for universal computation and construction.\n\nCodd's CA has eight states determined by a von Neumann neighborhood with rotational symmetry. \n\nThe table below shows the signal-trains needed to accomplish different tasks. Some of the signal trains need to be separated by two blanks (state 1) on the wire to avoid interference, so the 'extend' signal-train used in the image at the top appears here as '70116011'.\n\nCodd designed a self-replicating computer in the cellular automaton, based on Wang's W-machine. However, the design was so colossal that it evaded implementation until 2009, when Tim Hutton constructed an explicit configuration. There were some minor errors in Codd's design, so Hutton's implementation differs slightly, in both the configuration and the ruleset.\n\n\n"}

Its three main pillars are Chalutzism (\"pioneering spirit\", from the Hebrew word \"chalutz\", \"pioneer\"), Pluralism, and Zionism. The movement sees Judaism as the source of national, social and moral values that preserve the integrity and continuity of the Jewish people.\n\nThe main objective of the HaNoar Hatzioni is \"Hagshama Atzmit\" (personal materialization), which among other things means to have a full Jewish life in Israel. For its purposes the movement uses the scout method.\n\nDuring the years following the First World War, two ideological currents ran throughout European youth, Jews included: fascist nationalism and revolutionary Marxism. A small group of enlightened Jewish youths criticised the extremist positions and slogans and concluded that they would not endure reality. At the same time, they sensed the danger caused by the separation and division of people into two opposing camps, fighting each other. They then considered an obligation to create a youth movement.\n\nThe year was 1926 when the idea crystallized with the establishment of Hanoar Hatzioni. Already at its beginnings, the movement appeared on the scene as an educational movement extracting its principles at the foundations of Judaism, Zionism and pioneering.\n\nIn 1956, Hanoar Hatzioni was established in Britain. During this time, there was little on offer to Jewish youth. Hanoar Hatzioni offered an alternative to the highly political or religiously affiliated Zionist youth movements, and the non-political youth clubs.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Hanoar Hatzioni in Britain focused its activities in those parts which had very little to offer Jewish youth. Hanoar Hatzioni successfully ran weekly meetings all around the country, residential events such as camps that are continued to this day, and trips to Israel.\n\nHanoar has two underlying beliefs: (a) educating the Chanich (participant); and (b) a Jewish-Zionist worldview. Through this it strives to grow the future of the Jewish people with a belief in the centrality of the State of Israel.\n\nSince the times of the Second Temple, Judaism was very heavily engaged in argument and debate – this is what led to the writing of the Talmud. This has continued and Hanoar Hatzioni both accepts and encourages the existence of different streams of thought, philosophical conceptions and ways of practice, within the framework of the modern Jewish spectrum.\n\nAlso Hanoar Hatzioni accepts anyone who defines themselves as Jewish, beyond Orthodox Halacha requirements. It strives to create Chanichim with a strong identity of who participants are and what it means to be Jewish.\n\nTheir belief is that Zionism can and will bring together the dispersed nation in its historical homeland and that only in Israel can there be a full, normative and Jewish experience for an entire society.\n\nThe movement also recognises that there are many different conceptions of Zionism and values them all. However it also recognises the need to rank these different interpretations, with Israel being at the centre. Therefore, Aliyah is the highest expression of Judaism and Zionism and something all graduates (\"bogrim\", singular \"boger/et\") need to place before themselves as part of their self-realisation.\n\nThis is one of the central pillars of Hanoar Hatzioni and something that all participants must go through in their time in the movement. In the modern world this means finding the meeting point between personal interests and the needs of the nation. In Jewish history, before the creation of the State it was Kibbutzim that fulfilled these ideals – bringing justice and equality to the front as individuals would work together for the greater good of the collective. Hanoar Hatzioni hope that the renewed evaluation of the Kibbutz ideals will once again see these institutions at the front of society.\n\nThe Madrich is the foundation of its educational programme and the personal example of our Madrichim and Bogrim awards the ethical basis for its work. \nAs a result of this, HHUK directs the majority of its efforts towards content and ideals, with its heritage, Chanichim and Bogrim, representing a serious and responsible movement committed to Jewish-Zionist informal education.\n\nHanoar Hatzioni is currently located in 17 countries across four different continents, making for a truly global youth movement. Hanoar Hatzioni is active in England, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.\n\nParticipants and movement leaders (\"madrichim\", singular \"madrich/a\"; literally \"guides\") from all the different countries have opportunities to meet each other and interact on a variety of events, be it during Israel Tour, Gap Year, other trips to Israel as well as an annual international \"Seminar for Madrichim and Bogrim\" (SBM) which in 2010 was hosted in London, 2011 in Antwerp, 2012 in Budapest and 2013 in Athens.\n\nHanoar Hatzioni in Britain is a youth movement that works with leaders and participants wherever they may be. A range of activities are provided for at youth centres in Southend, King Solomon High School, Kulanu (Kenton), Rowley Lane and Shenley., the Zone in Leeds and the Hub in Manchester\n\nIn addition to regular activities, Hanoar Hatzioni UK offers an annual summer camp, Israel Tour and Gap Year Programmes. During the summer camps the participants are exposed to some of the most creative and spontaneous leaders around, they even have time to show off their vocal skills in their camp album.\n\nHanoar Hatzioni offers its members a membership scheme which means that they are kept up to date with activities as well as a discount on events that they want to attend It is a scheme that gives both the children and leaders something.\n\nMany members have gone on to do great things both for their communities back at home, as well as those in Israel. Spencer Gelding, formally the Mazkir (National Director) of Hanoar Hatzioni in Britain, has given his time to many charitable causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977232", "title": "Imperial Yeomanry", "text": "Imperial Yeomanry\n\nThe Imperial Yeomanry was a volunteer mounted force of the British Army that mainly saw action during the Second Boer War. Created on 2 January 1900, the force was initially recruited from the middle classes and traditional yeomanry sources, but subsequent contingents were more significantly working class in their composition. The existing yeomanry regiments contributed only a small proportion of the total Imperial Yeomanry establishment. In Ireland 120 men were recruited in February 1900. It was officially disbanded in 1908, with individual Yeomanry regiments incorporated into the new Territorial Force.\n\nThe Dutch Cape Colony was established in modern-day South Africa in the second half of the 17th century. The colony subsequently passed to the Dutch East India Company which, in 1815, sold it to the British, thus strengthening the rival British-ruled Cape Colony. Unhappy with the subsequent British governance, the Dutch settlers, known now as the Boers, established their own territories, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The two states were recognised by the British in 1881, following Boer victory in the First Boer War. The discovery of gold in the Transvaal in 1886 led to a gold rush, and the treatment of the prospectors by the Boers resulted in greater British government involvement, a revival of friction between the British and Boers and, in October 1899, the outbreak of the Second Boer War.\n\nAlthough the Boers were predominantly farmers and were heavily outnumbered by the regular forces of the British Army, they organised themselves into highly mobile mounted columns called commandoes and fought at long range with accurate rifle fire. Their tactics proved to be highly effective against the lumbering British forces, and in one week in December 1899, known as Black Week, they inflicted three significant defeats on the British. It soon became apparent that the British mounted capability – comprising small contingents of regular infantry on horseback and insufficiently supplied, ill-suited cavalry – needed to be reinforced.\n\nThe basis for just such reinforcement had been in existence since 1794 in the form of the volunteer Yeomanry Cavalry. Already, in October and November 1899, Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. Lucas, the yeomanry representative in the War Office and a member of the Loyal Suffolk Hussars, had proposed this force as a source of reinforcement. His proposals were initially declined, but the request by General Redvers Buller, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in South Africa, for mounted infantry after his defeat in the Battle of Colenso on 15 December 1899 prompted a rethink. The domestic yeomanry was, however, a small home defence force, only some 10,000 strong, steeped in a cavalry tradition and restricted by statute to service only in the United Kingdom, making it in itself unsuitable for service in South Africa.\n\nOn 18 December, Lords Lonsdale and Chesham, who both commanded yeomanry regiments, offered to recruit 2,300 volunteers from the domestic yeomanry for service in South Africa. Although Lord Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces opposed it, George Wyndham, Under-Secretary of State for War and himself a yeoman, established an imperial yeoman committee with Chesham and two other yeomanry commanders. The result, announced on 24 December, was the Imperial Yeomanry, which was duly established on 2 January 1900. By the end of the war, just under 35,000 men were recruited in three separate contingents. Its structure, companies and battalions rather than the squadrons and regiments of the domestic yeomanry, reflected its role as mounted infantry. The existing yeomanry was invited to provide volunteers for the new force, thus forming a relatively trained nucleus on which it was built. It was, however, a distinct body in its own right, separate from the home force, and the domestic yeomanry provided only around 18 per cent of the first contingent of over 10,000 men. Volunteers also came from the yeomanry's infantry counterpart, the Volunteer Force, but the majority were newly recruited from the yeomanry's traditional demographics of the middle class and the farming community, although some 30 per cent were working class. The first contingent recruits were able to build on the experience many of them already had with horsemanship and firearms courtesy of two or three months drilling in domestic yeomanry regiments before they were shipped to South Africa.\n\nThe first contingent of Imperial Yeomanry departed for South Africa between January and April 1900. Its first action came in the Battle of Boshof on 5 April, when its 3rd and 10th Battalions surrounded and defeated a small force of European volunteers and Boers commanded by the Comte de Villebois-Mareuil. This success was overshadowed by a disaster the next month which tarnished the Imperial Yeomanry's reputation, when its 13th Battalion was ambushed and surrounded by 2,500 Boers at Lindley on 27 May. The yeomen were besieged for four days before they finally surrendered, losing 80 killed and 530 captured. Among the prisoners were the future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, and four members of the House of Lords.\n\nAlthough the defeat at Lindley reflected poorly on the yeomanry, the yeomen had fought as competently as any regular soldier, and much of the blame lay with poor leadership by Lieutenant-Colonel Basil Spragge, the regular officer commanding the battalion, and the failure of Major-General Henry Colvile to come to the aid of the yeomanry with his Guards Brigade. Questionable leadership featured in another encounter between yeomanry and Boer at the Battle of Nooitgedacht on 13 December. Three companies of yeomanry formed part of a regular brigade commanded by Major-General R. A. P. Clements which was attacked as it camped, by a superior Boer force. Clements was heavily criticised for his poor choice of campsite, though his swift action enabled him to extricate his brigade, albeit with casualties, during which the yeomen demonstrated their ability to operate alongside the regular army in a complex combined operation.\n\nBy the end of March 1901, almost 30 per cent of the original 10,000+ Imperial Yeomanry had been killed, injured or taken prisoner, though the majority of losses were caused by disease. The slow demobilisation of the survivors, who were allowed to return home after just one year, and the arrival of a second contingent of over 16,000 new recruits increased the size of the Imperial Yeomanry in-country to over 23,000 by May, though this figure had fallen back to 13,650 by January 1902.\n\nA number of issues conspired against the second contingent. Recruitment, which had ceased after the first contingent had been raised, had to be restarted. The original intention was, as with the first contingent, to train new recruits for two or three months before sending them to South Africa, but the new Commander-in-Chief, Lord Kitchener, decided that they should be trained in-theatre and ordered that they be sent immediately. He failed to appreciate, however, that a pay rise had attracted a significantly greater number of working class recruits who had no prior experience of horses or firearms. Lord Chesham, who in 1901 became the Inspector General of the Imperial Yeomanry, would later state of the second draft that \"the shooting and riding test, if it was really applied in all cases, must have been one of very perfunctory character\". The difficulties of this sudden injection of raw, untrained recruits were compounded by the fact that only 655 of the original contingent elected to stay on, representing a significant loss of experience. Furthermore, the second tranche of domestic yeomanry officers who provided much of the leadership were not vetted by domestic yeomanry commanders as those few of the first contingent were, and proved to be of poor quality in the field.\n\nThe second contingent saw its first action at Vlakfontein on 29 May 1901, when four companies of Imperial Yeomanry were, along with a company of regular infantry and two guns of the Royal Artillery, part of a rear guard commanded by Brigadier-General H. G. Dixon. An attack by 1,500 Boers caused a significant portion of the yeomanry to break and fall back on the infantry, causing confusion and casualties, before a counter-attack by the infantry and one company of yeomanry forced the Boers to retire. Although only one 200-strong company of yeomanry was involved in the counter-attack, suffering nine casualties, the yeomanry suffered in total 30 per cent casualties, while the regular infantry suffered very heavily, losing 87 out of an estimated strength of 100.\n\nThe yeomanry's inexperience in defence and convoy protection was repeatedly exposed in Boer attacks. At Moedwil (also known as Rustenburg) on 30 September, the Boers inflicted nearly twice as many casualties as they sustained and killed or wounded all of the yeomanry's horses. In the Battle of Groenkop (also known as Tweefontein) on 25 December, 1,000 Boers surprised and practically annihilated the 400-strong 11th Battalion as the men slept, inflicting casualties of 289 killed, wounded and captured, for the loss of 14 killed and 30 wounded. At Yzerspruit on 25 February, a convoy escorted by 230 men of the yeomanry 5th Battalion and 225 regular infantry of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers was attacked by a 1,500-strong Boer force. The British beat back four charges before surrendering with the loss of 187 men killed or wounded, 62 of them yeomen, 170 horses, several hundred rifles and half a million rounds of ammunition, for the loss to the Boers of 51 men killed or wounded. In the Battle of Tweebosch on 7 March, a British column of 1,300 men, 300 of them Imperial Yeomanry, led by Lieutenant-General Paul Methuen, suffered 189 killed or wounded and 600 taken prisoner, Methuen among them. It was considered to be one of the most embarrassing defeats of the war, the blame for which was placed on the yeomanry; the 86th (Rough Riders) Company, a raw draft only recently sent to South Africa, lacked leadership, according to Methuen, and were \"very much out of hand, lacking both fire-discipline and knowledge of how to act\", and the 5th Battalion broke in the face of the Boer aggression, leading to the capture of the artillery and surrender of the column.\n\nAt the end of 1901, a third contingent of over 7,000 Imperial Yeomanry was raised. Having learned from the failures of the previous draft, these men underwent three months of thorough training in the UK, during which time sub-standard officers and men were weeded out, before being sent to South Africa, and a number of regular army officers were allocated to lead them. Representing the best prepared Imperial Yeomanry contingent, it arrived just as the war was ending, and saw only limited involvement.\n\nGeneral Edmund Allenby, who would rely on yeomanry regiments when he commanded the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, regarded the Imperial Yeomanry as useless. By the time they had learned enough to be of use, according to him, they had \"probably been captured two or three times, presenting the Boers on each occasion with a horse, rifle and 150 rounds of ammunition per man\". The colonial forces in South Africa had labelled the second contingent \"De Wet's Own\", after the Boer general Christiaan de Wet, so invaluable was it as a source of rifles and horses to the Boers. Questions were asked about the second contingent in the House of Commons, it began to be derided in the press, and in July 1901 Kitchener considered sending it back.\n\nA month later, Kitchener had relented a little, saying that although there were still some who could not be trusted, a good many of the sub-standard yeomanry had been removed and he was getting more value from the best of those remaining. Methuen blamed a lack of preparation and training for the yeomanry's poor performance, and later stated that, having gained experience during the campaign, he would \"place implicit reliance in them after a short time\". After seven months as commander of the Imperial Yeomanry, Major-General Reginald Brabazon also underlined the acquisition of experience when he wrote that it was \"as valuable a corps of fighting men as ever wore the Queen's uniform\". That the Imperial Yeomanry did on occasion perform well was exemplified by the action at Rustenburg where, although caught napping and losing the only column operating in the area at the time, the yeomen had fought as well as the regular infantry, and the 74th (Dublin) Company earned high praise for its conduct in beating off an attack on a convoy at Rooikopjes on 24 August.\n\nThe Imperial Yeomanry suffered 3771 casualties in the war, compared to the regular cavalry's 3623. Of all the auxiliary forces that saw action in South Africa, the yeomanry took the brunt of the fighting; more than 50 per cent of its casualties were a result of enemy action, compared to 24 per cent for the militia and 21 per cent for the Volunteer Force. Those imperial yeomen recruited from the domestic yeomanry returned to their home regiments, endowing them with their first battle honour, \"South Africa 1900–01\".\n\nThe gulf between domestic and imperial yeomanries is apparent from the fact that the former accepted only 390 new recruits from the latter after the war. By 1900, the domestic yeomanry establishment had stood at just over 12,000 while its actual strength was some 2,000 short of that figure. Although the force had been maintained for its utility as mounted police in aid of the authorities in times of civil unrest, this role had all but disappeared in the second half of the 19th century. The yeomanry failed to adapt, remaining wedded to its original military role of light or auxiliary cavalry and resolutely opposing moves in 1870 and 1882 to convert it to a mounted infantry role. By the end of the 19th century, the domestic yeomanry was militarily weak, largely unchanged since its formation over a century previously, of questionable benefit and no clear purpose. The experiences in South Africa suddenly made the force relevant again, not only for the wave of enthusiasm that saw its numbers double, nor the relatively small role the domestic yeomanry played in the Imperial Yeomanry, but in the clear indication of the necessity of mounted infantry over traditional cavalry. This was identified by the Harris Committee – chaired by the former Assistant Adjutant general of the Imperial Yeomanry, Lord Harris, and comprising six yeomanry officers and a regular cavalry officer, convened to advise on the future organisation, arms and equipment of the domestic yeomanry – and informed the Militia and Yeomanry Act of 1901.\n\nThe new legislation renamed the domestic yeomanry \"en bloc\" to \"Imperial Yeomanry\" and converted it from cavalry into mounted infantry, replacing its primary weapon, the sword, with rifle and bayonet. It introduced khaki uniforms, mandated a standard four-squadron organisation and added a machine-gun section to each regiment. The yeomanry's establishment was set at 35,000, though effective strength was only around 25,000, and to achieve these numbers, 18 new regiments were raised, 12 of them resurrected from disbanded 19th century corps of yeomanry. The Harris Committee was not unanimous, and it was in fact a minority report by just two officers that recommended the removal of \"cavalry\" from the yeomanry's title (it being generally referred to as \"Yeomanry Cavalry\" before the rename) and the retirement of the sword. The yeomanry resisted these changes. Three regiments petitioned the king to be allowed to retain the sword on parade, and all but one of the 35 commanding officers petitioned the army for its retention in 1902.\n\nAs well as issues with the domestic yeomanry, the Boer War also exposed the wider problem of reinforcing the army with sufficiently trained men in times of need. This occupied much of the debate concerning military reform in the first decade of the 20th century, and gave the yeomanry the opportunity to retain its treasured role as cavalry by positioning itself as a semi-trained reserve to the numerically weak regular cavalry. This was reflected in a change to the training instructions issued to the Imperial Yeomanry in 1902 and 1905. The former warned the yeomanry not to aspire to a cavalry role and made no distinction between yeomen and mounted infantry, but the latter merely proscribed the traditional cavalry tactic of shock action while otherwise aligning the yeomanry with the cavalry, giving it in effect the role of dismounted cavalry.\n\nThe changed focus in training was prompted by plans to allocate six yeomanry regiments as divisional cavalry in the regular army, supported by the establishment within the Imperial Yeomanry of a separate class of yeoman free of the restriction on service overseas. This, however, relied on men volunteering for such service, and offered the regular army no guarantee that enough men would do so. That enough would volunteer was made more doubtful by the requirement that they should abandon their civilian lives for the six months of training considered necessary for them to be effective in such a reserve role. As a result, the plans were dropped from the final legislation that combined the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry, now without the \"Imperial\" prefix, into a single, unified auxiliary organisation, the Territorial Force, in 1908.\n\n\n"}

The majority of conopids are black and yellow, or black and white, and often strikingly resemble wasps, bees, or flies of the family Syrphidae, themselves notable bee mimics. A conopid is most frequently found at flowers, feeding on nectar with its proboscis, which is often long.\n\nFor terms see Morphology of Diptera.\n\nRather thinly pilose or nearly bare, elongate or stout flies of small to large size (3–20 mm, usually 5–15 mm). They are often lustrous with a black and yellow colour pattern or with reddish brown markings. The head is broad and the frons is broad in both sexes. Ocelli may be present or absent (Conopinae). Ocellar bristles are small or absent. Interfrontal bristles and vibrissae are absent. The antennae have three segments, the third bearing a dorsal bare arista or terminal style. Above the antennae is an inflatable ptilinum. The oral opening is large and the proboscis is long and slender and often geniculate. The base of the abdomen is often constricted and the genitalia of both sexes are conspicuous. In the females the genitalia are often large or greatly elongated. The wing is usually clear, in some cases with dark markings often along the costa. The costa is continuous and the subcostal vein is complete. The anal cell is closed and the first basal cell is always very long, the second moderately\nlong. The apical cell is closed or much narrowed. Tibiae are with (Myopinae) or without dorsal preapical bristle.\n\nSample genera: \"Conops\", \"Dalmannia\", \"Physocephala\", \"Stylogaster\", \"Myopa\", and \"Physoconops\".\n\nThe larvae of all conopids are internal parasites, most of aculeate (stinging) Hymenoptera. Adult females aggressively intercept their hosts in flight to deposit eggs. Accordingly, in the species \"Bombus terrestris\", it has been shown that vulnerable foraging bees are likely the most susceptible to parasitism by conopids. The female's abdomen is modified to form what amounts to a \"can opener\" to pry open the segments of the host's abdomen as the egg is inserted. The subfamily Stylogastrinae, including the genus \"Stylogaster\", is somewhat different, in that the egg itself is shaped somewhat like a harpoon, with a rigid barbed tip, and the egg is forcibly jabbed into the host. Some species of \"Stylogaster\" are obligate associates of army ants, using the ants' raiding columns to flush out their prey. Certain members of the genus \"Physocephala\" have minor economic importance as parasites of honey bees. Some members of this genus, such as \"Physocephala tibialis\" have been shown to induce honeybees to bury themselves before they die, allowing the adult fly to emerge from their hosts underground. More research is needed to determine the life histories of most conopids.\n\n\nKeys to Palaearctic species but now needs revision (in German).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977241", "title": "Commodore 64 Games System", "text": "Commodore 64 Games System\n\nThe Commodore 64 Games System (often abbreviated C64GS) is the cartridge-based home video game console version of the popular Commodore 64 home computer. It was released in December 1990 by Commodore into a booming console market dominated by Nintendo and Sega. It was only released in Europe and was a considerable commercial failure.\n\nThe C64GS came bundled with a cartridge that featured four games: \"Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun\", \"International Soccer\", \"Flimbo's Quest\" and \"Klax\".\n\nThe C64GS was not Commodore's first gaming system based on the C64 hardware. However, unlike the 1982 MAX Machine (a game-oriented computer based on a very cut-down version of the same hardware family), the C64GS is internally very similar to the complete C64, with which it is compatible.\n\nSupport from games companies was limited, as many were unconvinced that the C64GS would be a success in the console market. Ocean Software was the most supportive, offering a wide range of titles, some C64GS cartridge-based only, offering features in games that would have been impossible on cassette-based games, others straight ports of games for the original C64. Domark and System 3 also released a number of titles for the system, and conversions of some Codemasters and MicroProse games also appeared. Denton Designs also released some games, among them Bounces, which was released in 1985.\n\nThe software bundled with the C64GS, a four-game cartridge containing \"Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun\", \"International Soccer\", \"Flimbo's Quest\" and \"Klax\", were likely the most well known on the system. These games, with the exception of \"International Soccer\", were previously ordinary tape-based games, but their structure and control systems (no keyboard needed) made them well-suited to the new console. \"International Soccer\" was previously released in 1983 on cartridge for the original C64 computer.\n\nOcean produced a number of games for the C64GS, among them a remake of \"Double Dragon\", \"Navy SEALS\", \"RoboCop 2\", \"RoboCop 3\", \"Chase HQ 2: Special Criminal Investigation\", \"Pang\", \"Battle Command\", \"Toki\", \"Shadow of the Beast\" and \"Lemmings\". They also produced \"Batman The Movie\" for the console, but this was a direct conversion of the cassette game, evidenced by the screens prompting the player to \"press PLAY\" that briefly appeared between levels. Some of the earliest Ocean cartridges had a manufacturing flaw, where the connector was placed too far back in the cartridge case. The end result was that the cartridge could not be used with the standard C64 computer. Members of Ocean staff had to manually drill holes in the side of the cartridges to make them fit.\n\nSystem 3 released \"Last Ninja Remix\" and \"\", although both were also available on cassette. Domark also offered two titles, \"Badlands\" and \"Cyberball\", which were available on cartridge only.\n\nThrough publisher The Disc Company, a number of Codemasters and MicroProse titles were also reworked and released as compilations for the C64GS. \"Fun Play\" featured three Codemasters titles: \"Fast Food\", \"Professional Skateboard Simulator\" and \"Professional Tennis Simulator\". \"Power Play\" featured three MicroProse titles: \"Rick Dangerous\", \"Stunt Car Racer\" and \"MicroProse Soccer\", although \"Rick Dangerous\" was produced by Core Design, not MicroProse themselves. \"Stunt Car Racer\" and \"MicroProse Soccer\" needed to be heavily modified to enable them to run on the C64GS.\n\nCommodore never produced or published a single title for the C64GS beyond the bundled four-game cartridge. \"International Soccer\" was the only widely available game for the C64GS but had actually been written for the C64.\n\nThe C64GS was plagued with problems from the outset. Firstly, despite the wealth of software already available on cartridge for C64, the lack of a keyboard means that most cannot be used with the console. This means that much of the cartridge-based C64 software, while fundamentally compatible with the C64GS, was unplayable. The standard C64 version of \"\" was designed for the console, but was included on a cartridge that required the user to press a key in the initial menu to access the game, rendering it unplayable, despite the game itself being entirely playable with joystick only on a conventional C64.\n\nTo partially compensate for the lack of a keyboard, the basic control system for the C64GS was a joystick supplied by Cheetah called the Annihilator. This joystick, while using the standard Atari 9-pin plug, offers two independent buttons, with the second button located on the base of the joystick. The joystick standard is fundamentally compatible with the ZX Spectrum's Kempston Interface and the Sega Master System, but no other joystick on the market offered compatibility with the proprietary second-button function. Standard C64 joysticks and Sega Master System controllers were fundamentally supported, but the lack of second-button support (the Sega Master System's second button did not function in the same way) meant that the Cheetah Annihilator was essential for playing certain titles such as \"Last Ninja Remix\" and \"Chase HQ 2\". However, it was poorly built, had a short life, and was not widely available, making replacements difficult to come by.\n\nPrior to the console's release, Commodore had generated a great deal of marketing hype to generate interest in an already crowded market. \"Zzap!64\" and \"Your Commodore\", Commodore 64 magazines of the era, reported that Commodore had promised \"up to 100 titles before December\", even though December was two months from the time of its writing. In reality 28 games were produced for the console during its shelf life - most of which were compilations of older titles, and a majority of which were from Ocean. Of those 28 titles, only 9 were cartridge-exclusive titles, the remainder being ports of older cassette-based games.\n\nWhile most of the titles that Ocean announced did appear for the GS (with the notable exception of \"Operation Thunderbolt\"), a number of promises from other publishers failed to materialize. Although Thalamus, The Sales Curve, Mirrorsoft and Hewson had expressed an interest, nothing ever materialized from these firms. Similar problems plagued rival company Amstrad when they released their GX4000 console the same year.\n\nThere were other reasons attributed to the failure of the C64GS, the major ones being the following:\n\n\nCommodore eventually shipped the four-game cartridge and Cheetah Annihilator joysticks in a \"Playful Intelligence\" bundle with the standard Commodore 64C computer. Several years later, Commodore's next attempt at a games console, the Amiga CD32, encountered many of the same problems, although overall it was a lot more successful than the C64GS.\n\nThe specifications of the C64GS are a subset of those of the regular C64; the main differences being the omission of the user port, serial interface, and cassette port. Since the system board is a regular C64C board these ports are actually present, but simply not exposed at the rear.\n\nThe C64GS is the lowest selling console of all time, with only 2000 out of the 20000 units that were made getting sold.\n\nCommodore used all the useless Terminator 2: Judgement Day (which was going to be the launch title) copies as bundles for the C64, which demolished sales of the GS, making Commodore recall all GS's to turn them back into C64's.\n\n\nThe ROM contains two important differences from a standard C64 ROM. The first is that switching on the machine without a cartridge present results in a character-based animation asking the user to insert a cartridge. The second is an additional set of windowing commands, designed to compensate for the lack of a keyboard. However, there is no known software that uses it.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Whitney (1841–1904), the very wealthy businessman and United States Secretary of the Navy. Harry was the older brother of William Payne Whitney (1876–1927). His sister, Pauline Payne Whitney (1874–1916), was married to Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough (1861–1949), and his youngest sister, Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887–1968), was married Willard Dickerman Straight (1880–1918) and later, Leonard Knight Elmhirst (1893–1974), after Straight's death.\n\nHarry Payne Whitney studied at Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts then attended Yale University, graduating in 1894. He was a member of the Skull and Bones. After Yale, he spent two years in Columbia Law School, but never finished the course and decided to enter the world of sports and business. He was a member of the class of 1898. In 1904, after the death of his father, he inherited $24,000,000, and in 1917, he inherited approximately $12,000,000 from his uncle, Oliver Hazard Payne.\n\nAn avid sportsman, he was a ten-goal polo player. His love of the sport was inherited from his father who had been involved with polo when it was first organized in the United States in 1876 by James Gordon Bennett, Jr. H. P. Whitney organized the U. S. polo team that beat England in 1909. \"Whitney Field\" polo field near Saratoga Springs, New York is named for him. He was a board member of the Montauk Yacht Club and competed with his yacht \"Vanitie\" in the America's Cup. Whitney also served on the board of directors of the Long Island Motor Parkway, built by his wife's cousin, William Kissam Vanderbilt II.\n\nWhitney also enjoyed quail hunting and purchased the Foshalee Plantation in northern Leon County, Florida from Sydney E. Hutchinson of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhitney was a major figure in thoroughbred horse racing and in 2018 he was voted one of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame's most prestigious honors as an Exemplar of Racing.\n\nHarry Whitney inherited a large stable from his father including the great filly Artful and her sire Hamburg, and in 1915 established a horse breeding farm in Lexington, Kentucky where he developed the American polo pony by breeding American Quarter Horse stallions with his thoroughbred mares. He was thoroughbred racing's leading owner of the year in the United States on eight occasions and the breeder of almost two hundred stakes race winners. His leading sire was first Hamburg and then the great sire Broomstick, by Ben Brush. His Kentucky-bred horse Whisk Broom II (sired by Broomstick) raced in England, then at age six came back to the U.S. where he won the New York Handicap Triple. He also owned Upset, who gave Man o' War the only loss of his career.\n\nWhitney had nineteen horses who ran in the Kentucky Derby, winning it the first time in 1915 with another Broomstick foal, Regret, the first filly ever to capture the race. Regret went on to earn Horse of the Year honors and was named to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Whitney won the Kentucky Derby for the second time in 1927 with the colt Whiskery. His record of six wins in the Preakness Stakes stood as the most by any breeder until 1968 when Calumet Farm broke the record. Whitney's colt Burgomaster won the 1906 Belmont Stakes and also received Horse of the Year honors. Amongst many, Whitney's breeding operation produced Equipoise and Johren.\n\nWhitney's stable won the following prestigious U.S. Triple Crown races:\n\n\nHis Lexington, Kentucky stud farm was passed on to his son, C.V. Whitney, who owned it until 1989 when it became part of Gainesway Farm.\n\nOn August 25, 1896 he married Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942), a member of the wealthy Vanderbilt family. In New York, the couple lived in town houses originally belonging to William Whitney, first at 2 East 57th St., across the street from Gertrude's parents, and after William Whitney's death, at 871 Fifth Avenue. They also had a country estate in Westbury, Long Island. Together, they had three children:\n\nHarry Whitney died in 1930 at age fifty-eight. He and his wife are interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx. \"TIME\" magazine reported that at the time of his death, Harry Payne Whitney's estate was appraised by New York State for tax collection purposes at $62,808,000 net.\n\nThe benefactor to many organizations, in 1920 H. P. Whitney financed the Whitney South Seas Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, Rollo Beck's major zoological expedition that sent teams of scientists and naturalists to undertake botanical research and to study the bird population of several thousand islands in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Whitney Collection of Sporting Art was donated in his memory to the Yale University Art Gallery.\n\n"}

{"id": "1977257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977257", "title": "WTOV-TV", "text": "WTOV-TV\n\nWTOV-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 9, is a dual NBC/Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Steubenville, Ohio, United States and also serving Wheeling, West Virginia. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. WTOV's studios and transmitter are located on Burr Avenue in Mingo Junction, Ohio (mailing address reads Red Donley Plaza in Steubenville).\n\nThe station went on air as WSTV-TV (for STeubenVille) on December 24, 1953. It was owned by Rust Craft Broadcasting along with WSTV radio (1340 AM), which went off the air in 2011, and 103.5 FM (now WLYI). When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened bidding for the channel 9 license, Rust Craft and CBS emerged as the favorites. CBS planned to move the station's license to Pittsburgh in order to get its own station in what was then the sixth-largest market. However, the FCC turned CBS' bid down. The major cities in the Upper Ohio Valley are so close together that they must share the VHF band, and the FCC had opted not to issue any more VHF construction permits to Pittsburgh in order to give Wheeling–Steubenville and the other smaller markets in the area a chance to get on the air. The Wheeling–Steubenville TV market, despite its very close proximity to Pittsburgh and overlapping signals, remains a separate market today.\n\nChannel 9 was originally a CBS affiliate, but also carried a secondary affiliation with ABC, sharing that network's programming with NBC affiliate WTRF-TV (channel 7). It changed its call letters to WTOV (standing for \"We're Television for the Ohio Valley\") on June 1, 1979 after Rust Craft merged with Ziff Davis and sold off the radio stations. The call letters had been previously used for a TV station in Portsmouth, Virginia that is now WGNT. During its time as a CBS affiliate, the station struggled in the ratings due to the presence of Group W powerhouse KDKA-TV (channel 2) in Pittsburgh, which to this day remains widely viewable in the area both over-the-air and available on cable. The station began phasing out ABC in the 1970s, but continued to carry a few ABC programs in off-hours for many years. Channel 9 had little need to air many ABC shows due to the presence of WTAE-TV (channel 4) and Youngstown affiliate WYTV (channel 33) on cable systems in the area.\n\nOn January 7, 1980, WTOV swapped affiliations with WTRF and became an NBC affiliate. At the time of the switch, NBC had struggled in the ratings for a number of years and then-market leader WTRF wanted a stronger affiliation. However, in the ensuing years the affiliation switch began to benefit WTOV. For starters, instead of competing with KDKA-TV for network programming from the nearby Pittsburgh market, WTOV now competed with future sister station WIIC-TV, channel 11 (which became WPXI the following year), which, until recently, had been one of NBC's weakest major-market affiliates. Secondly, NBC as a whole began to improve in the ratings in the early 1980s, and by the middle of the decade, was America's most-watched network, while CBS went through a serious decline that the network wouldn't recover from until the late 1990s. The affiliation with NBC also gave the station rights to carry the majority of Steelers games via the NFL on NBC package until 1997, and since 2006 a few games per year via NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\", allowing it a good opportunity to establish itself with viewers (the station is within the NFL blackout contour, though the Steelers have never had a blackout since the current NFL blackout policy went into effect). These factors led WTOV-TV to surpass WTRF-TV in the ratings in the Wheeling–Steubenville market, a position it now holds by a wide margin.\n\nIn 1983, Ziff Davis sold WTOV, along with then-sister stations WEYI-TV in Saginaw, Michigan, WRDW-TV in Augusta, Georgia and WROC-TV in Rochester, New York, to Television Station Partners, L.P. Under the new ownership, channel 9 was the last NBC affiliate known to have used the old \"Proud N\" in its branding, keeping it for two years after NBC adopted its current simplified peacock logo in 1986. WTOV, along with WEYI and WROC, were sold to Smith Broadcast Group in 1996. In 2000, Cox Enterprises acquired WTOV, along with fellow NBC affiliate WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on the other side of the Pittsburgh market, from Sunrise/STC Broadcasting (one of several subsidiaries of Smith Broadcasting). The station dropped the remaining ABC shows from its schedule soon after Cox took over. It also updated its logo to resemble that of sister station WPXI in Pittsburgh, and along with WJAC, the three were occasionally marketed together as a result until WPXI revamped its news graphics and music package.\n\nWTOV's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.\n\nThe station airs tape-delayed high school football games of the week including numerous playoff games of local teams. WTOV aired many college football and basketball games from ABC and ESPN Plus. On June 3, 2010, Dish Network added WTOV, along with PBS member station WOUC and CBS affiliate WTRF (and the latter station's digital subchannels) as the local stations available to its subscribers in the Steubenville–Wheeling market. WTOV and the other Steubenville–Wheeling area television stations were added to DirecTV on November 23, 2010.\n\nOn July 20, 2012, one day after Cox purchased four television stations in Jacksonville, Florida and Tulsa, Oklahoma from Newport Television, Cox put WTOV-TV, WJAC-TV, and sister stations in El Paso, Texas and Reno, Nevada (all in markets that are smaller than Tulsa), plus several radio stations in medium to small markets, on the selling block. On February 25, 2013, Cox announced that it would sell the four television stations to Sinclair Broadcast Group. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 29, and the deal was consummated on May 2. The deal made WTOV-TV a sister station to Pittsburgh's Fox affiliate WPGH-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WPMY, though it is still connected to WPXI through a news-share agreement WPXI has had with WPGH-TV since 2006.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, it was announced that WTOV would add Fox programming to its subchannel on September 1, which will serve as the Steubenville–Wheeling area's Fox affiliate, replacing the second digital subchannel of WTRF-TV. In a statement, Fox stated that it switched stations because WTOV has a stronger over-the-air signal than WTRF. Fox programming began broadcasting on September 1, replacing MeTV, which moved to a newly created subchannel.\n\nWTOV's signal can be reached as far north as Sharon, Pennsylvania, as far west as Coshocton, as far east as Greensburg, Pennsylvania and as far south as Sistersville, West Virginia. Although the area is much better served by fellow NBC affiliate WPXI, WTOV's signal can easily be picked up in higher-elevated areas of the city of Pittsburgh with only a \"rabbit-ear\" antenna. WTOV is also carried on many cable systems that fall outside of its broadcast signal in northern West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and east-central Ohio.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nAside from NBC programming and local news, syndicated programming on the station includes \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Dr. Phil\", \"Jeopardy!\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", among others.\n\nWTOV was the first station in the Ohio Valley to broadcast its local newscasts in widescreen enhanced definition in April 2009, and it currently runs almost all of its syndicated programming in HD (rival WTRF launched the first high-definition newscast in the market on December 29, 2011, during its noon newscast). When WTOV converted its newscasts to the 16:9 widescreen format, the graphics and set got a slight upgrade to match the 16:9 aspect ratio, though the weather graphics were not upgraded until August 2010.\n\nOn October 27, 2010 during the noon newscast, WTOV unveiled a new HD-ready set similar to that used by sister stations WPXI/Pittsburgh and WJAC/Johnstown, among other Cox-owned stations. The station's former graphics were launched in 2000, when Cox Enterprises bought WTOV and WJAC. With the new set and graphics, the station flipped its news theme to 615 Music's \"The Tower,\" ending a nine-year run of using that same company's \"Total Coverage\" news music package. Sister station WJAC followed suit on October 25, 2011.\n\nAs part of its upgrade, the station launched \"Early Warning Live Doppler 9\" using Doppler weather radar data from five National Weather Service radar sites in the region. The station also updated master control to allow for weather warnings and news crawls without downconverting 16:9 video on the main signal to the 4:3 picture format.\n\nOn January 8, 2011, WTOV launched an hour-long Saturday morning newscast. On March 21, 2011, WTOV expanded its early evening newscast to a 90-minute block from 5-6:30 p.m. The extra half-hour replaced syndicated reruns of \"Seinfeld\", which aired on the station for 15 years (that series currently airs on cable-only CW Plus affiliate \"WBWO\").\n\nIn announcing WTOV's Fox subchannel, Sinclair stated that it would carry an hour-long, WTOV-produced 10 p.m. newscast which debuted on October 6, 2014. In addition, WTOV flipped its graphics and news package to the Sinclair News Package. WJAC followed suit in 2016.\n\n\n"}

This creature blends many features of West African and European fairies but was usually regarded as a demonic figure.\n\nThe name comes from the Tupi language \"kuru'pir\", meaning \"covered in blisters\". According to the cultural legends, this creature has bright red/orange hair, and resembles a man or a dwarf, but its feet are turned backwards. \"Curupira\" lives in the forests of Brazil and uses its backward feet to create footprints that lead to its starting point, thus making hunters and travelers confused. Besides that, it can also create illusions and produce a sound that's like a high pitched whistle, in order to scare and drive its victim to madness. It is common to portray a \"Curupira\" riding a collared peccary, much like another Brazilian creature called \"Caipora\".\n\nA \"Curupira\" will prey on poachers and hunters that take more than they need of the forest, and he also attacks people who hunt animals that were taking care of their offspring. \nThere are many different versions of the legend, and so the creature's appearance and habits may vary from each region in Brazil. However, \"Curupira\" is considered a nationwide folkloric figure.\n\nA being called the Demon Curupira was featured in several episodes of the 1999 – 2002 television series \"BeastMaster\". Played by Australian actress Emilie de Ravin, this Curupira, while still possessing the backwards feet, had the appearance of a young and deceptively sweet-faced blonde girl clad in green. She was a spirit of the forest and very capricious; she protected the animals, particularly tigers, and with a kiss she could drain humans of their lives, reducing their bodies to mere husks. She was an uneasy ally of the title character, Dar.\n\n"}
{"id": "1977259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977259", "title": "Brackla", "text": "Brackla\n\nBrackla () is a large housing estate, community and electoral ward in the east of Bridgend in Bridgend County Borough, Wales. Along with the communities of Bridgend and Coychurch Lower, it makes up the town of Bridgend. At the 2001 census the community of Brackla had a population of 10,113, increasing to 11,749 at the 2011 Census, making up nearly a quarter of Bridgend's population.\n\nUntil 1936, the of land occupied east to west by the Bridgend Industrial Estate, Brackla and the Brackla Industrial Estate was farmland. In 1936, in view of the increasing likelihood of war with Germany, the British Government decided to build two new Royal Ordnance Factories, including one at Bridgend on the site of what is now Bridgend Industrial Estate. To store munitions, they dug eight long shafts under Brackla Hill, connecting it to two new ordnance factories on what is now Brackla Industrial Estate. Both facilities were connected to the Great Western Railway South Wales Main Line, with the line to the Brackla facility running along what is now Church Acre. At its peak, ROF 53 employed some 40,000 people, and was the biggest single factory in Western Europe.\n\nAfter World War II, ROF 53 stopped production at the end of 1945, and closed completely by the end of 1946. The land was sold to property developers, with that north of the railway developed for housing.\n\nIn the late 1960s, two of the former munitions tunnels were redeveloped by the Ministry of Defence on behalf of the Home Office as a nuclear command bunker for South Wales, designated SRHQ 8.2. Brackla became the regional control centre for all of Wales, redesignated RGHQ 8.2. Sold in 1996, it has been derelict ever since.\n\nBrackla is the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community. The ward elects four county councillors to Bridgend County Borough Council.\n\nAt the community level, Brackla elects 11 community councillors (and one youth councillor) to Brackla Community Council.\n\nBrackla has four primary schools; Brackla Primary, Tremains Primary; Archdeacon John Lewis Church in Wales School & Ysgol cymraeg \nBro Ogwr. Archbishop McGrath Catholic High School is a secondary school in the area.\n\nBrackla contains a small shopping centre, named the Triangle, consisting of a supermarket (a Co-operative Supermarket) and other convenience stores (a Well Pharmacy branch, amongst others). Brackla has only three Public Houses situated in the area.\n\nBrackla Community Council has recently begun work to gain Nature Reserve status for the local Tremains Wood.

His twin objectives were to restore communications between the two cities and to crush any resistance encountered on the way. As the soldiers entered County Kildare they discovered the bodies of several rebel victims, among them Lieutenant William Giffard, the son of the commander of the Dublin militia, Captain John Giffard, which reportedly inflamed the soldiers.\n\nHowever, by the time Duff's column arrived in Monasterevin in County Kildare, at 7.00 a.m. on 29 May, the bulk of the rebel forces had already accepted a government amnesty from Generals Gerard Lake and Ralph Dundas, following their defeat at the battle of Kilcullen and had surrendered at Knockaulin Hill, several miles to the east of the Curragh on 27 May. Not aware that the rebels were gathering to surrender on the Curragh plain, Duff reinforced his column and marched to the nearby town of Kildare, and on to the adjacent southwest corner of the Curragh. \n\nDuff's force had by now grown to 700 militia, dragoons and yeomanry with four pieces of artillery (three having been presumably left at Monasterevin). The designated place of surrender, the ancient fort of Gibbet Rath, was a wide expanse of plain with little or no cover for miles around but neither the rebels nor Duff's force had seemingly any reason to fear treachery as a separate peaceful surrender to General Dundas at Knockaulin Hill, who was accompanied only by two dragoons, had been successfully accomplished without bloodshed.\n\nBy the time of Duff's arrival at Gibbet Rath on the morning of 29 May, an army of between 1,000–2,000 rebels were waiting to surrender in return for the promised amnesty. They were subjected to an angry tirade for their treason by Duff who ordered them to kneel for pardon and then to stack their arms. Shortly after the weapons were stacked an infantry and cavalry assault resulted in the death of about 350 men. Accounts of why the massacre began differ. Rebel claims that Duff ordered his troops to attack the disarmed and surrounded men were denied by Duff himself who claimed that the rebels fired on his men, while another source recorded “\"one man in the crowd, saying he would not hand over his fire-lock loaded, blazed it off in the air\"”.\n\nHowever, Duff redrafted his own official report of the engagement before submission to Dublin Castle, his final draft was transmitted without the references to his knowledge of the surrender preparations. The original report read as follows with the items in brackets excised from his final report;\"\"My Dear Genl. (I have witnessed a melancholy scene) We found the Rebels retiring from this Town on our arrival armed. We followed them with Dragoons; I sent on some of the Yeomen to tell them, on laying down their arms, they should not be hurt. Unfortunately some of them Fired on the Troops; from that moment they were attacked on all sides, nothing could stop the Rage of the Troops. I believe from Two to Three hundred of the Rebels were killed. (They intended, we are told, to lay down their arms to General Dundas). We have 3 men killed & several wounded. I am too fatigued to enlarge. I have forwarded the mails to Dublin.\"\"\n\nThe grieving Captain John Giffard expressed his own satisfaction as follows;\"\"My troops did not leave my hero unavenged – 500 rebels bleaching on the Curragh of Kildare—that Curragh over which my sweet innocent girls walked with me last Summer, that Curragh was strewed with the vile carcasses of popish rebels and the accursed town of Kildare has been reduced to a heap of ashes by our hands.\"\"\n\nGeneral Duff received no censure for the massacre and, upon his arrival in Dublin the following day, was feted as a hero by the population who honoured him with a victory parade. General Dundas, by contrast, was denounced for having shown clemency towards the rebels. However, because of the massacre, wavering rebels were discouraged from surrendering and there were no further capitulations in county Kildare until the final surrender of William Aylmer in July. Dr Chambers (see below) considers that Lake and Duff were not in communication about the surrenders, being on opposites sides of the Curragh. Duff and his 500 men had arrived in Kildare town after a forced march from Limerick and found it sacked by the rebels, along with the piked body of Duff's nephew.\n\nDuff was later involved in an unsuccessful campaign after the battle of Vinegar Hill to trap and destroy a surviving rebel column in Wexford led by Anthony Perry who fought and eluded Duff's forces at the battle of Ballygullen/Whiteheaps on 5 July. \n\n\n"}

He operates a number of restaurants including Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester which holds three stars (the top ranking) in the Michelin Guide.\n\nDucasse was born in Orthez in southwestern France and was educated on a farm in Castel-Sarrazin. In 1972, when he was sixteen, Ducasse began an apprenticeship at the Pavillon Landais restaurant in Soustons and at the Bordeaux hotel school. After this apprenticeship, he began work at Michel Guérard's restaurant in Eugénie-les-Bains while also working for Gaston Lenôtre during the summer months. In 1977, Ducasse started working as an assistant at Moulin de Mougins under legendary chef Roger Vergé, creator of Cuisine du Soleil, and learned the Provençal cooking methods for which he was later known.\n\nIn 2012 he held 21 Michelin stars, making him the second ranked chef worldwide in terms of total Michelin stars (Joël Robuchon had 31) and Gordon Ramsay had 17 at the time.\n\nDucasse's first position as chef came in 1980 when he took over the kitchens at L'amandier in Mougins. One year later, he assumed the position of head chef at La Terrasse in the Hôtel Juana in Juan-les-Pins. In 1984, he was awarded two stars in the Michelin Red Guide. In the same year Ducasse was the only survivor of a Piper Aztec aircraft crash that injured him severely.\n\nIn 1986, Ducasse was offered the Chef position at the Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo, with management including the hotel's Le Louis XV. After assuring himself that the Hotel's other restaurant operations were operating well, Ducasse continued to run management.\n\nIn 1988, Ducasse expanded beyond the restaurant industry and opened La Bastide de Moustiers, a twelve-bedroom country inn in Provence and he began attaining financial interests in other Provence hotels. On 12 August 1996, the Alain Ducasse restaurant opened in Le Parc – Sofitel Demeure Hôtels in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The Red Guide awarded the restaurant three stars just eight months after opening.\n\nDucasse came to the United States and in June 2000 opened the Alain Ducasse restaurant in New York City's Essex hotel at 160 Central Park South, receiving the Red Guide's three stars in December 2005, in the first Red Guide for NYC. Ducasse became the first chef to have 3 restaurants awarded 3 Michelin stars at the same time. That restaurant closed in 2007 when Ducasse chose to open a restaurant in Las Vegas named Mix, which later went on to earn one star in the Michelin Red Guide. In early 2008, Ducasse opened Adour, at the St. Regis Hotel on 16th and K Street in Washington, D.C., and has also opened a more casual Bistro Benoit New York, at 60 West 55th Street.\n\nOn 2 July 2011, Alain Ducasse prepared a multi-course gala dinner for Prince Albert, his bride Charlene Wittstock, and their 500 A-list guests at their royal wedding. It was the first time Ducasse prepared an official meal for a head of state. He was also in charge of preparing the post-festivities brunch on 3 July, in conjunction with Joël Robuchon.\n\nDucasse became the first chef to own restaurants carrying three Michelin Stars in three cities. The New York restaurant was dropped from the 2007 Michelin Guide because the restaurant was scheduled to close. Ducasse has become known through his writing and influences. Ducasse is also only one of two chefs to hold 21 Michelin stars throughout his career.\n\nHe has been special guest in the US and Italian versions of \"MasterChef\". In 2013 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement on The World's 50 Best Restaurants List.\n\nDucasse was a French citizen by birth. On 17 June 2008, he became a naturalized citizen of Monaco. He chose Monegasque citizenship in order to take advantage of the principality's tax rates.\n\nAlain Ducasse's restaurants, cooking schools, cookbooks, and consulting activities had revenues of $15.9 million in 2002. Since that time, Ducasse has been expanding his reach. Alain Ducasse has also opened a cooking school for the general public in Paris and another for chefs (ADF), which also works for the European Space Agency to develop astronaut meals to be taken into space. Ducasse has also authored numerous books, with the most famous being Alain Ducasse Culinary Encyclopedia.\n\nIn 2005, Ducasse opened his first Asian restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nDucasse's restaurants include:\n\nIn 2004 Alain Ducasse opened a restaurant in a resort near Biarritz, in the French Basque Country. However, after several bombing attacks by Irrintzi, an armed Basque nationalist organization, which accused him of being a speculator and of \"folkloring\" the Basque Country, Ducasse decided to leave the Basque Country.\n\nIn 2010 Ducasse opened a miX restaurant at the W Hotel in Vieques, Puerto Rico, but he closed it in 2012.\n\nOn 29 November 2017, Melco Resorts announced that Alain Ducasse will open two new restaurants and a bar at the upcoming Morpheus Hotel at City of Dreams, Macau. The restaurants are to be called \"Alain Ducasse at Morpheus\" and \"Voyages by Alain Ducasse\". In March 2017, Ducasse opened Rech by Alain Ducass in the Intercontinental Hong Kong.\n\n"}

The leaves are evergreen, alternately arranged, lanceolate, long and broad, dark green above (purplish in winter) and white beneath with the leaf margins curled under. The flowers are bell-shaped, white to pink, long; flowering is in late spring to early summer.

The specific epithet is a noun in apposition, which Linnaeus based on Johann Christian Buxbaum's pre-Linnaean generic designation \"Polifolia\". Buxbaum in turn derived the name from Johann Bauhin, who used it to mean \"having \"polium\"-like leaves\". The precise plant that Bauhin meant by \"polium\" is uncertain, but it may have been \"Teucrium montanum\". The common name \"bog rosemary\" derives from the superficial resemblance of the leaves to those of rosemary, which is not closely related.\n\nMany fossil seeds of †Andromeda carpatica have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. \n\nNumerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, all of which require damp acid soil in shade.

{"id": "1977274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977274", "title": "Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant", "text": "Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant\n\nThe Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant () is one of Finland's two nuclear power plants, the other being the two-unit VVER Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is owned and operated by Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), a subsidiary of Pohjolan Voima, and is located on Olkiluoto Island, on the shore of the Gulf of Bothnia, in the municipality of Eurajoki in western Finland.\n\nThe Olkiluoto plant consists of two boiling water reactors (BWRs), each producing 890 MW of electricity. \nA third reactor, Unit 3, is expected to be online in March 2021.\n\nUnit 3 is an EPR reactor and has been under construction since 2005. The start of commercial operation was originally planned for May 2009 but the project has been delayed and, , the latest estimate for start of regular production is March 2021. In December 2012, the French multi-national building contractor, Areva, estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about €8.5 billion, or almost three times the delivery price of €3 billion.\n\nA decision-in-principle for a fourth reactor to be built at the site was granted by the Finnish parliament in July 2010, but, in June 2015, TVO decided that it would not apply for a construction license for Olkiluoto 4.\n\nUnits 1 and 2 consists of two BWRs, each producing 890 MW of electricity. The main contractor was ASEA-Atom, now a part of Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB. Turbine generators were supplied by Stal-Laval. The units' architecture was designed by ASEA-Atom. The reactor pressure vessels were constructed by Uddcomb Sweden AB, and reactor internal parts, mechanical components by Finnatom. The electrical equipment was supplied by Strömberg. Unit 1 was constructed by Atomirakennus and unit 2 by Jukola and Työyhtymä. Unit 1 achieved its initial criticality in July 1978 and it started commercial operations in October 1979. Unit 2 achieved its initial criticality in October 1979 and it started commercial operations in July 1982.\n\nThe original power of the reactors was 660 MW. They were uprated to 710 MW in 1983–1984, to 840 MW in 1995–1998, and further to 860 MW in 2005–2006. Major upgrades were carried out to the units in 2010 and 2011, including replacement of turbines and generators, isolation valves, electrical switchgear and seawater pumps. The upgrades increased the net electrical output by 20 MW to 880 MW each.\n\nIn 2017, unit 2 was upgraded and modernized, increasing the output further to 890 MW from the beginning of 2018. A similar upgrade to unit 1 was performed in 2018. The extended maintenance was also made to prepare for a license renewal application. The license extension was granted in September 2018 and allows the reactors to operate until 2038.\n\nIn February 2005, the Finnish government gave its permission to TVO to construct a new nuclear reactor, making Finland the first Western European country in 15 years to order one. The construction of the unit began in 2005. The start of commercial operation was planned for 2010, but has been pushed back several times. , the estimate for start of regular production is March 2021.\n\nOlkiluoto 3 is the first EPR, which is a type of third generation PWR, to have gone into construction. It will have a nameplate capacity of 1600 MW. Japan Steel Works and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured the unit's 526-ton reactor pressure vessel.\n\nAt the start of construction, the main contractor was Areva NP (now Framatome, after the sell-off mentioned below), a joint venture of Areva and Siemens. However, in 2009, Siemens sold its one-third share of Areva NP to Areva, which is now the main contractor. Siemens remained on the project as the subcontractor with the main responsibility for constructing the turbine hall. Areva sold its majority stake in Framatome (previously Areva NP), its nuclear reactor and fuel business, to Électricité de France.\n\nAccording to TVO, the construction phase of the project would create a total of about 30,000 person-years of employment directly and indirectly; that the highest number of on-site employees has been almost 4,400; and that the operation phase would create 150 to 200 permanent jobs.\n\nThe first license application for the third unit was made in December 2000 and the date of the unit's entry into service was estimated to be 2010. However, since the start of construction, several delays to the schedule have been announced. In July 2012 TVO announced that the unit would not go into service before 2015, five years after the original estimate. In a statement, the operator said it was \"not pleased with the situation\" although solutions to various problems were being found and work was \"progressing\", and that it was waiting for a new launch date from Areva and Siemens. At the end of 2013, TVO said that the Areva-Siemens consortium plans to reduce workers and subcontractors on the construction site and says that it expects the contractor to provide details about the expected impact on the project's schedule. In February 2014, TVO said that it could not give an estimate of the plant's startup date because it was still waiting for the Areva-Siemens consortium to provide it with an updated overall schedule for the project.\" Later the same month it was reported that Areva was shutting down construction due to the dispute over compensations and unfinished automation planning. According to Kauppalehti, the estimated opening was delayed until 2018–2020. In July 2019 TVO announced that regular electricity generation is expected to start in July 2020. The delay was caused by slower than expected modification works. In December 2019 TVO announced that regular electricity generation is delayed to March 2021 due to slow progress in system testing and delivery time of spare parts to replace faulty components.\n\nThe delays have been due to various problems with planning, supervision, and workmanship, and have been the subject of an inquiry by STUK, the Finnish nuclear safety regulator. The first problems that surfaced were irregularities in the foundation concrete, and caused a delay of months. Later, it was found that subcontractors had provided heavy forgings that were not up to project standards and which had to be re-cast. An apparent problem constructing the reactor's unique double-containment structure also caused delays, as the welders had not been given proper instructions.\n\nIn 2009, Petteri Tiippana, the director of STUK's nuclear power plant division, told the BBC that it was difficult to deliver nuclear power plant projects on schedule because builders were not used to working to the exacting standards required on nuclear construction sites, since so few new reactors had been built in recent years.\n\nIn 2010, Jukka Laaksonen, Director General of STUK at that time, analyzed reasons for the delay:\n\nConstruction of the turbine succeeded better under the responsibility of Siemens. Installations of the main turbine equipment were completed about one year behind the original schedule.\n\nAfter the construction of the unit started in 2005, Areva began constructing EPRs in Flamanville, France, and in Taishan, China. However, as of 2019, the construction of the EPR in France is ten years behind schedule. Taishan 1 in China became the first EPR to start power generation on 29 June 2018, and the second one (Taishan 2) came online in 2019.\n\nThe main contractor, Areva, is building the unit for a fixed price of €3 billion, so in principle, any construction costs above that price fall on Areva. In July 2012, those overruns were estimated at more than €2 billion, and in December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor would be about €8.5 billion, well over the previous estimate of €6.4 billion. Because of the delays, TVO and Areva are both seeking compensation from each other through the International Court of Arbitration.\n\nIn October 2013, TVO's demand for compensation from Areva had risen to €1.8 billion, and Areva's from TVO to €2.6 billion. In December 2013, Areva increased its demand to €2.7 billion. On March 10, 2018 French newspaper Le Monde announced that Areva and TVO have reached an agreement. A day later, TVO confirmed that Areva would pay it €450 million in compensation over the delays and lost income. The agreement would settle all legal actions between the two companies. With the settlement, TVO disclosed its total investment to be around € 5.5 billion. Areva had accumulated losses of € 5.5 billion. The total cost of the project, therefore, is estimated to be € 11 billion. \n\nIn 2009, professor Stephen Thomas wrote, \"Olkiluoto has become an example of all that can go wrong in economic terms with new reactors,\" and that Areva and the TVO \"are in bitter dispute over who will bear the cost overruns and there is a real risk now that the utility will default.\"\n\nThe project has also been criticized by STUK because \"instructions have not been observed in the welding of pipes and the supervision of welding.\" STUK has also noted that there have been delays in submitting proper paperwork.\n\nOlkiluoto 3 was supposed to be the first reactor of 3+ generation which would pave the way for a new wave of identical reactors across Europe, safe, affordable, and delivered on time. The delays and cost overruns have had knock-on effects in other countries.\n\nThe construction workforce includes about 3,800 employees from 500 companies. 80% of the workers are foreigners, mostly from eastern European countries. In 2012 it was reported that one Bulgarian contracting firm is owned by the mafia, and that Bulgarian workers have been required to pay weekly protection fees to the mafia, wages have been unpaid, employees have been told not to join a union and that employers also reneged on social security payments.\n\nOn 14 February 2008, TVO submitted an environmental impact assessment of unit four to the Ministry of Employment and Economy. On 21 April 2010, the government of Finland decided to grant a decision-in-principle to Teollisuuden Voima for the fourth reactor in Olkiluoto. The decision was approved by the parliament on 1 July 2010. If constructed, the fourth unit would be a PWR or a BWR with a power output of 1,000 to 1,800 MW.\n\nIn September 2014, with unit 3 still unfinished, the Finnish government rejected TVO's request for time extension of the unit 4 decision-in-principle. Economic Affairs Minister Jan Vapaavuori referred to the long delay of the 3rd reactor and to unsatisfactory assurances by TVO that the 4th unit would ever be built. Nevertheless PM Stubb stated that the rejection didn't spell the end for the OL4 project, and that TVO would have the opportunity to apply for a construction license before the decision-in-principle expires in June 2015.\n\nIn June 2015 TVO decided not to apply for a construction permit for the Olkiluoto 4 unit because of delays with the unit 3, however saying they are prepared to file for a new decision-in-principle later.\n\nThe \"Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository\" is a deep geological repository for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the first such repository in the world. It is currently under construction at the Olkiluoto plant by the company Posiva, owned by the nuclear power plant operators Fortum and TVO.\n\nThe waste heat, an output common to all thermal power plants, which heats the cooling water (at 13 °C) is utilized for small-scale agriculture before being pumped back to the sea. The power plant hosts the northernmost vineyard in the world, a 0.1 ha experimental plot that yields 850 kg Zilga grapes annually. Another use is a pond for growing crabs, whitefish and sturgeon for caviar.\n\nIn April 2014 a turbine steam condenser of unit 1 had a small seawater leak, at a rate of two litres per hour. According to the operator, the leak forced to limit the plant output down to 300 MW, but was not serious and was to be repaired in a day.\n\n"}

{"id": "1977277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977277", "title": "Humanitas", "text": "Humanitas\n\nHumanitas is a Latin noun meaning human nature, civilization, and kindness. It has uses in the Enlightenment, which are discussed below.\n\nThe Latin word \"humanitas\" corresponded to the Greek concepts of \"philanthrôpía\" (loving what makes us human) and \"paideia\" (education) which were amalgamated with a series of qualities that made up the traditional unwritten Roman code of conduct (\"mos maiorum\"). Cicero (106–43 BC) used \"humanitas\" in describing the formation of an ideal speaker (orator) who he believed should be educated to possess a collection of virtues of character suitable both for an active life of public service and a decent and fulfilling private life; these would include a fund of learning acquired from the study of \"bonae litterae\" (\"good letters\", i.e., classical literature, especially poetry), which would also be a source of continuing cultivation and pleasure in leisure and retirement, youth and old age, and good and bad fortune.\n\nInsofar as \"humanitas\" corresponded to \"philanthrôpía\" and \"paideia\", it was particularly applicable to guiding the proper exercise of power over others. Hence Cicero's advice to his brother that \"if fate had given you authority over Africans or Spaniards or Gauls, wild and barbarous nations, you would still owe it to your \"humanitas\" to be concerned about their comforts, their needs, and their safety.\" Echoing Cicero over a century later, Pliny the Younger (61-112 A.D.) defined \"humanitas\" as the capacity to win the affections of lesser folk without impinging on greater (Ep. IX, 5).\n\nThe concept was of great importance during the re-discovery of Classical Antiquity during the age of the Renaissance by the Italian \"umanisti\", beginning with the illustrious Italian poet Petrarch, who revived Cicero's injunction to cultivate the humanities, understood during the Renaissance as grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy.\n\nIn 1333, in Liège, Belgium, Petrarch had found and copied out in his own hand a manuscript of Cicero's speech, \"Pro Archia\", which contained a famous passage in defense of poetry and \"litterae\" (letters): \"Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.\" (Translation: \"These studies sustain youth and entertain old age, they enhance prosperity, and offer a refuge and solace in adversity; they delight us when we are at home without hindering us in the wider world, and are with us at night, when we travel and when we visit the countryside\").\nPetrarch liked this quotation and referred to it often, and where Cicero used the phrase \"\"litterarum lumen\"\", \"the light of literature\", Petrarch in the margin wrote \"lumen litterarum\" alongside and drew a sketch of a lamp or candle. The Liège manuscript is lost and so is Petrarch's copy, but Petrarch's copy \"can be shown to be behind all but one of the later manuscripts\" and preserve Petrarch's marginal annotations. Petrarch, in many respects a Medieval man, regretted that Cicero had not been a Christian and believed that he certainly would have been one had he not died before the birth of Jesus. To Petrarch and the Renaissance \"umanisti\" who immediately followed him, Cicero's \"humanitas\" was not seen as in conflict with Christianity or a Christian education. In this they followed the fifth century Church fathers such as Jerome and Augustine, who taught that Greek and Roman learning and literature were gifts of God and models of excellence, provided, of course, they were filtered and purified in order to serve Christianity.\n\nAccording to historian Peter Gay, the eighteenth-century French philosophes of the Enlightenment found Cicero's eclectic, Stoic-tinged paganism congenial:The ideal of \"humanitas\" was first brought to Rome by the philosophic circle around Scipio and further developed by Cicero. For Cicero, \"humanitas\" was a style of thought, not a formal doctrine. It asserted man’s importance as a cultivated being, in control of his moral universe. The man who practiced \"humanitas\" was confident of his worth, courteous to others, decent in his social conduct, and active in his political role. He was a man, moreover, who faced life with courageous skepticism: he knows that the consolations of popular religion are for more credulous beings than himself, that life is uncertain, and that sturdy pessimism is superior to self-deceptive optimism. Man becomes man as he refines himself; he even becomes godlike: “\"Deus est mortali iuvare mortalem\",” wrote Pliny, translating a Greek Stoic, “To help man is man’s true God.” Finally, the man who practiced \"humanitas\" cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities as he listened to his reason: \"\"Cum musis,\"” wrote Cicero, “\"id est, cum humanitate et doctrina habere commercium\"\". Virtue, Cicero insisted, is nothing but nature perfected and developed to its highest point, and there is therefore a resemblance between man and God: \"\"Est autem virtus nihil aliud quam in se perfecta et ad summum perducta natura; est igitur homini cum deo similitudio\"\".\n\nCicero’s \"humanitas\" . . . reappeared in the first century in Seneca’s claim – made in the midst of a lament over Roman bestiality – that man is a sacred thing to man: “\"homo res sacra homini\"”; and reappeared once more in the eighteenth century in Kant’s call for human autonomy and in Voltaire’s stern injunction: “Remember your dignity as a man.” In the beginning of his \"Meditations\", the Emperor Marcus Aurelius elaborated a veritable catalog of qualities which, all together, made up the virtues which Cicero had called \"humanitas\" and which the \"philosophes\" hoped they possessed in good measure: modesty, self-control, manliness, beneficence, practicality, generosity, rationality, tolerance, and obedience to the dictates of nature.\n\nDuring the Aufklärung (or German version of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment), the term \"\"Humanität\"\" was used to designate the intellectual, physical, and moral formation of \"a better human being\" (or Humanism). It was used, for example, by theologian Johann Gottfried Herder in his \"Briefe zur Beförderung der Humanität\" (\"Letters for the Advancement of Humanity\"), 1792, and by Friedrich Schiller, among others.Herder's \"Humanität\" is a broad concept he defines variously as the gradual fulfillment of best human potential, the achievement of reason and fairness in all classes and in all affairs of men, and the joint product of the creative actions of legislators, poets, artists, philosophers, inventors, and educators through the ages.\n\nAlthough Herder is considered the originator of ethnic nationalism, he was no chauvinist. He maintained that each person loves his own nation, family, language, and customs not because they are better than other peoples' but because they were his. Love for one's own individuality ought to lead to respect for that of others. For Herder, the image of God was imprinted in each human being, along with an internal impulse for self-improvement and growth. Historian William McNeil writes that Herder boldly proclaimed that:each age and every people embody ideals and capacities peculiar to themselves, thus allowing a fuller and more complete expression of the multiform potentialities of humankind than could otherwise occur. Herder expressly denied that one people or civilization was better than another. They were just different, in the same way that the German language was different from the French.\n\nIn Roman humanism, benevolence (\"benevolentia\") was considered a feature of \"Humanitas\". This notion is particularly underscored in the works of Cicero and Seneca. In this context, benevolence drives the idea of humaneness and is understood as a feeling either of love or tenderness so that it makes \"someone willing to participate, at the level of feeling, in whatever is human.\" Such participation entails a willingness to engage both in human suffering and joy. This was echoed in the Kantian position on love, where the thinker cited the so-called rational benevolence driven by natural sympathetic joy and pity. \n\nOther thinkers have also discussed benevolence in modern humanism. Max Scheler, for example, used it as an important element in his discourse of sympathy. In one of his works, he linked benevolence and the concept of \"fellow-feeling,\" which allows self-love, self-centred choice, solipsism and egoism\" to finally be wholly overcome. Scheler specifically equated benevolence with humanitarianism, explaining that these concepts - along with fellow-feeling - embrace all men, \"simply because they are men.\"\n\n\"Humanitas\" as benevolence, is also a cornerstone of the credo of Freemasonry and constituted one of the bases for its position that nationality and religion do not matter, only universal humanity. Some orders of Freemasonry are called \"Humanitas\".\n\n"}

Each of these contributes to the optical resolution of the system, as will the environment in which the imaging is done.\n\nResolution depends on the distance between two distinguishable radiating points. The sections below describe the theoretical estimates of resolution, but the real values may differ. The results below are based on mathematical models of Airy discs, which assumes an adequate level of contrast. In low-contrast systems, the resolution may be much lower than predicted by the theory outlined below. Real optical systems are complex and practical difficulties often increase the distance between distinguishable point sources.\n\nThe resolution of a system is based on the minimum distance formula_1 at which the points can be distinguished as individuals. Several standards are used to determine, quantitatively, whether or not the points can be distinguished. One of the methods specifies that, on the line between the center of one point and the next, the contrast between the maximum and minimum intensity be at least 26% lower than the maximum. This corresponds to the overlap of one Airy disk on the first dark ring in the other. This standard for separation is also known as the Rayleigh criterion. In symbols, the distance is defined as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nThis formula is suitable for confocal microscopy, but is also used in traditional microscopy. In confocal laser-scanned microscopes, the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function is often used to avoid the difficulty of measuring the Airy disc. This, combined with the rastered illumination pattern, results in better resolution, but it is still proportional to the Rayleigh-based formula given above.\n\nAlso common in the microscopy literature is a formula for resolution that treats the above-mentioned concerns about contrast differently. The resolution predicted by this formula is proportional to the Rayleigh-based formula, differing by about 20%. For estimating theoretical resolution, it may be adequate.\n\nWhen a condenser is used to illuminate the sample, the shape of the pencil of light emanating from the condenser must also be included.\n\nIn a properly configured microscope, formula_12.\n\nThe above estimates of resolution are specific to the case in which two identical very small samples that radiate incoherently in all directions. Other considerations must be taken into account if the sources radiate at different levels of intensity, are coherent, large, or radiate in non-uniform patterns.\n\nThe ability of a lens to resolve detail is usually determined by the quality of the lens but is ultimately limited by diffraction. Light coming from a point in the object diffracts through the lens aperture such that it forms a diffraction pattern in the image which has a central spot and surrounding bright rings, separated by dark nulls; this pattern is known as an Airy pattern, and the central bright lobe as an Airy disk. The angular radius of the Airy disk (measured from the center to the first null) is given by:\n\nTwo adjacent points in the object give rise to two diffraction patterns. If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the Airy disk angular radius, then the two points cannot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary \"Rayleigh criterion\" that two points whose angular separation is equal to the Airy disk radius to first null can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the greater the resolution. Astronomical telescopes have increasingly large lenses so they can 'see' ever finer detail in the stars.\n\nOnly the very highest quality lenses have diffraction limited resolution, however, and normally the quality of the lens limits its ability to resolve detail. This ability is expressed by the Optical Transfer Function which describes the spatial (angular) variation of the light signal as a function of spatial (angular) frequency. When the image is projected onto a flat plane, such as photographic film or a solid state detector, spatial frequency is the preferred domain, but when the image is referred to the lens alone, angular frequency is preferred. OTF may be broken down into the magnitude and phase components as follows:\n\nwhere\n\nThe OTF accounts for aberration, which the limiting frequency expression above does not. The magnitude is known as the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the phase portion is known as the Phase Transfer Function (PTF).\n\nIn imaging systems, the phase component is typically not captured by the sensor. Thus, the important measure with respect to imaging systems is the MTF.\n\nPhase is critically important to adaptive optics and holographic systems.\n\nSome optical sensors are designed to detect spatial differences in electromagnetic energy. These include photographic film, solid-state devices (CCD, CMOS detectors, and infrared detectors like PtSi and InSb), tube detectors (vidicon, plumbicon, and photomultiplier tubes used in night-vision devices), scanning detectors (mainly used for IR), pyroelectric detectors, and microbolometer detectors. The ability of such a detector to resolve those differences depends mostly on the size of the detecting elements.\n\nSpatial resolution is typically expressed in line pairs per millimeter (lppmm), lines (of resolution, mostly for analog video), contrast vs. cycles/mm, or MTF (the modulus of OTF). The MTF may be found by taking the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the spatial sampling function. Smaller pixels result in wider MTF curves and thus better detection of higher frequency energy.\n\nThis is analogous to taking the Fourier transform of a signal sampling function; as in that case, the dominant factor is the sampling period, which is analogous to the size of the picture element (pixel).\n\nOther factors include pixel noise, pixel cross-talk, substrate penetration, and fill factor.\n\nA common problem among non-technicians is the use of the number of pixels on the detector to describe the resolution. If all sensors were the same size, this would be acceptable. Since they are not, the use of the number of pixels can be misleading. For example, a 2-megapixel camera of 20-micrometre-square pixels will have worse resolution than a 1-megapixel camera with 8-micrometre pixels, all else being equal.\n\nFor resolution measurement, film manufacturers typically publish a plot of Response (%) vs. Spatial Frequency (cycles per millimeter). The plot is derived experimentally. Solid state sensor and camera manufacturers normally publish specifications from which the user may derive a theoretical MTF according to the procedure outlined below. A few may also publish MTF curves, while others (especially intensifier manufacturers) will publish the response (%) at the Nyquist frequency, or, alternatively, publish the frequency at which the response is 50%.\n\nTo find a theoretical MTF curve for a sensor, it is necessary to know three characteristics of the sensor: the active sensing area, the area comprising the sensing area and the interconnection and support structures (\"real estate\"), and the total number of those areas (the pixel count). The total pixel count is almost always given. Sometimes the overall sensor dimensions are given, from which the real estate area can be calculated. Whether the real estate area is given or derived, if the active pixel area is not given, it may be derived from the real estate area and the fill factor, where fill factor is the ratio of the active area to the dedicated real estate area.\n\nwhere\n\nIn Gaskill's notation, the sensing area is a 2D comb(\"x\", \"y\") function of the distance between pixels (the \"pitch\"), convolved with a 2D rect(\"x\", \"y\") function of the active area of the pixel, bounded by a 2D rect(\"x\", \"y\") function of the overall sensor dimension. The Fourier transform of this is a formula_18 function governed by the distance between pixels, convolved with a formula_19 function governed by the number of pixels, and multiplied by the formula_19 function corresponding to the active area. That last function serves as an overall envelope to the MTF function; so long as the number of pixels is much greater than one (1), then the active area size dominates the MTF.\n\nSampling function:\n\nwhere the sensor has \"M\"×\"N\" pixels\n\nAn imaging system running at 24 frames per second is essentially a discrete sampling system that samples a 2D area. The same limitations described by Nyquist apply to this system as to any signal sampling system.\n\nAll sensors have a characteristic time response. Film is limited at both the short resolution and the long resolution extremes by reciprocity breakdown. These are typically held to be anything longer than 1 second and shorter than 1/10,000 second. Furthermore, film requires a mechanical system to advance it through the exposure mechanism, or a moving optical system to expose it. These limit the speed at which successive frames may be exposed.\n\nCCD and CMOS are the modern preferences for video sensors. CCD is speed-limited by the rate at which the charge can be moved from one site to another. CMOS has the advantage of having individually addressable cells, and this has led to its advantage in the high speed photography industry.\n\nVidicons, Plumbicons, and image intensifiers have specific applications. The speed at which they can be sampled depends upon the decay rate of the phosphor used. For example, the P46 phosphor has a decay time of less than 2 microseconds, while the P43 decay time is on the order of 2-3 milliseconds. The P43 is therefore unusable at frame rates above 1000 frames per second (frame/s). See External links for links to phosphor information.\n\nPyroelectric detectors respond to changes in temperature. Therefore, a static scene will not be detected, so they require choppers. They also have a decay time, so the pyroelectric system temporal response will be a bandpass, while the other detectors discussed will be a lowpass.\n\nIf objects within the scene are in motion relative to the imaging system, the resulting motion blur will result in lower spatial resolution. Short integration times will minimize the blur, but integration times are limited by sensor sensitivity. Furthermore, motion between frames in motion pictures will impact digital movie compression schemes (e.g. MPEG-1, MPEG-2). Finally, there are sampling schemes that require real or apparent motion inside the camera (scanning mirrors, rolling shutters) that may result in incorrect rendering of image motion. Therefore, sensor sensitivity and other time-related factors will have a direct impact on spatial resolution.\n\nThe spatial resolution of digital systems (e.g. HDTV and VGA) are fixed independently of the analog bandwidth because each pixel is digitized, transmitted, and stored as a discrete value. Digital cameras, recorders, and displays must be selected so that the resolution is identical from camera to display. However, in analog systems, the resolution of the camera, recorder, cabling, amplifiers, transmitters, receivers, and display may all be independent and the overall system resolution is governed by the bandwidth of the lowest performing component.\n\nIn analog systems, each horizontal line is transmitted as a high-frequency analog signal. Each picture element (pixel) is therefore converted to an analog electrical value (voltage), and changes in values between pixels therefore become changes in voltage. The transmission standards require that the sampling be done in a fixed time (outlined below), so more pixels per line becomes a requirement for more voltage changes per unit time, i.e. higher frequency. Since such signals are typically band-limited by cables, amplifiers, recorders, transmitters, and receivers, the band-limitation on the analog signal acts as an effective low-pass filter on the spatial resolution. The difference in resolutions between VHS (240 discernible lines per scanline), Betamax (280 lines), and the newer ED Beta format (500 lines) is explained primarily by the difference in the recording bandwidth.\n\nIn the NTSC transmission standard, each field contains 262.5 lines, and 59.94 fields are transmitted every second. Each line must therefore take 63 microseconds, 10.7 of which are for reset to the next line. Thus, the retrace rate is 15.734 kHz. For the picture to appear to have approximately the same horizontal and vertical resolution (see Kell factor), it should be able to display 228 cycles per line, requiring a bandwidth of 4.28 MHz. If the line (sensor) width is known, this may be converted directly into cycles per millimeter, the unit of spatial resolution.\n\nB/G/I/K television system signals (usually used with PAL colour encoding) transmit frames less often (50 Hz), but the frame contains more lines and is wider, so bandwidth requirements are similar.\nNote that a \"discernible line\" forms one half of a cycle (a cycle requires a dark and a light line), so \"228 cycles\" and \"456 lines\" are equivalent measures.\n\nThere are two methods by which to determine system resolution. The first is to perform a series of two dimensional convolutions, first with the image and the lens, then the result of that procedure with the sensor, and so on through all of the components of the system. This is computationally expensive, and must be performed anew for each object to be imaged.\n\nThe other method is to transform each of the components of the system into the spatial frequency domain, and then to multiply the 2-D results. A system response may be determined without reference to an object. Although this method is considerably more difficult to comprehend conceptually, it becomes easier to use computationally, especially when different design iterations or imaged objects are to be tested.\n\nThe transformation to be used is the Fourier transform.\n\nThe human eye is a limiting feature of many systems, when the goal of the system is to present data to humans for processing.\n\nFor example, in a security or air traffic control function, the display and work station must be constructed so that average humans can detect problems and direct corrective measures. Other examples are when a human is using eyes to carry out a critical task such as flying (piloting by visual reference), driving a vehicle, and so forth.\n\nThe best visual acuity of the human eye at its optical centre (the fovea) is less than 1 arc minute per line pair, reducing rapidly away from the fovea.\n\nThe human brain requires more than just a line pair to understand what the eye is imaging. Johnson's criteria defines the number of line pairs of ocular resolution, or sensor resolution, needed to recognize or identify an item.\n\nSystems looking through long atmospheric paths may be limited by turbulence. A key measure of the quality of atmospheric turbulence is the seeing diameter, also known as Fried's seeing diameter. A path which is temporally coherent is known as an \"isoplanatic\" patch.\n\nLarge apertures may suffer from aperture averaging, the result of several paths being integrated into one image.\n\nTurbulence scales with wavelength at approximately a 6/5 power. Thus, seeing is better at infrared wavelengths than at visible wavelengths.\n\nShort exposures suffer from turbulence less than longer exposures due to the \"inner\" and \"outer\" scale turbulence; short is considered to be much less than 10 ms for visible imaging (typically, anything less than 2 ms). Inner scale turbulence arises due to the eddies in the turbulent flow, while outer scale turbulence arises from large air mass flow. These masses typically move slowly, and so are reduced by decreasing the integration period.\n\nA system limited only by the quality of the optics is said to be diffraction-limited. However, since atmospheric turbulence is normally the limiting factor for visible systems looking through long atmospheric paths, most systems are turbulence-limited. Corrections can be made by using adaptive optics or post-processing techniques.\n\nwhere\n\nA variety of measurement systems are available, and use may depend upon the system being tested.\n\nTypical test charts for Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) consist of repeated bar patterns (see Discussion below). The limiting resolution is measured by determining the smallest group of bars, both vertically and horizontally, for which the correct number of bars can be seen. By calculating the contrast between the black and white areas at several different frequencies, however, points of the CTF can be determined with the contrast equation.\n\nformula_26\n\nwhere\n\nWhen the system can no longer resolve the bars, the black and white areas have the same value, so Contrast = 0. At very low spatial frequencies, \"C\" = 1 and \"C\" = 0 so Modulation = 1. Some modulation may be seen above the limiting resolution; these may be aliased and phase-reversed.\n\nWhen using other methods, including the interferogram, sinusoid, and the edge in the ISO 12233 target, it is possible to compute the entire MTF curve. The response to the edge is similar to a step response, and the Fourier Transform of the first difference of the step response yields the MTF.\n\nAn interferogram created between two coherent light sources may be used for at least two resolution-related purposes. The first is to determine the quality of a lens system (see LUPI), and the second is to project a pattern onto a sensor (especially photographic film) to measure resolution.\n\nThis 5 bar resolution test chart is often used for evaluation of microfilm systems and scanners. It is convenient for a 1:1 range (typically covering 1-18 cycles/mm) and is marked directly in cycles/mm. Details can be found in ISO-3334.\n\nThe USAF 1951 resolution test target consists of a pattern of 3 bar targets. Often found covering a range of 0.25 to 228 cycles/mm. Each group consists of six elements. The group is designated by a group number (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.) which is the power to which 2 should be raised to obtain the spatial frequency of the first element (e.g., group \"-2\" is 0.25 line pairs per millimeter). Each element is the 6th root of 2 smaller than the preceding element in the group (e.g. element 1 is 2^0, element 2 is 2^(-1/6), element 3 is 2(-1/3), etc.). By reading off the group and element number of the first element which cannot be resolved, the limiting resolution may be determined by inspection. The complex numbering system and use of a look-up chart can be avoided by use of an improved but not standardized layout chart, which labels the bars and spaces directly in cycles/mm using OCR-A extended font.\n\nformula_29\n\nThe NBS 1952 target is a 3 bar pattern (long bars). The spatial frequency is printed alongside each triple bar set, so the limiting resolution may be determined by inspection. This frequency is normally only as marked after the chart has been reduced in size (typically 25 times). The original application called for placing the chart at a distance 26 times the focal length of the imaging lens used. The bars above and to the left are in sequence, separated by approximately the square root of two (12, 17, 24, etc.), while the bars below and to the left have the same separation but a different starting point (14, 20, 28, etc.)\n\nThe EIA 1956 resolution target was specifically designed to be used with television systems. The gradually expanding lines near the center are marked with periodic indications of the corresponding spatial frequency. The limiting resolution may be determined by inspection. The most important measure is the limiting horizontal resolution, since the vertical resolution is typically determined by the applicable video standard (I/B/G/K/NTSC/NTSC-J).\n\nThe IEEE 208-1995 resolution target is similar to the EIA target. Resolution is measured in horizontal and vertical TV lines.\n\nThe ISO 12233 target was developed for digital camera applications, since modern digital camera spatial resolution may exceed the limitations of the older targets. It includes several knife-edge targets for the purpose of computing MTF by Fourier transform. They are offset from the vertical by 5 degrees so that the edges will be sampled in many different phases, which allow estimation of the spatial frequency response beyond the Nyquist frequency of the sampling.\n\nThe idea is analogous to the use of a white noise pattern in acoustics to determine system frequency response.\n\nThe interferogram used to measure film resolution can be synthesized on personal computers and used to generate a pattern for measuring optical resolution. See especially Kodak MTF curves.\n\nA multiburst signal is an electronic waveform used to test analog transmission, recording, and display systems. The test pattern consists of several short periods of specific frequencies. The contrast of each may be measured by inspection and recorded, giving a plot of attenuation vs. frequency. The NTSC3.58 multiburst pattern consists of 500 kHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 3 MHz, and 3.58 MHz blocks. 3.58 MHz is important because it is the chrominance frequency for NTSC video.\n\nUsing a bar target that the resulting measure is the contrast transfer function (CTF) and not the MTF. The difference arises from the subharmonics of the square waves and can be easily computed.\n\n\n\n"}

H. C. Whitehead's 1941 paper cited below, while the term 'crossed module' is introduced in his 1946 paper cited below. These ideas were well worked up in his 1949 paper 'Combinatorial homotopy II', which also introduced the important idea of a free crossed module. Whitehead's ideas on crossed modules and their applications are developed and explained in the book by Brown, Higgins, Sivera listed below. Some generalisations of the idea of crossed module are explained in the paper of Janelidze.\n\nLet \"N\" be a normal subgroup of a group \"G\". Then, the inclusion\nis a crossed module with the conjugation action of \"G\" on \"N\".\n\nFor any group \"G\", modules over the group ring are crossed \"G\"-modules with \"d\" = 0.\n\nFor any group \"H\", the homomorphism from \"H\" to Aut(\"H\") sending any element of \"H\" to the corresponding inner automorphism is a crossed module.\n\nGiven any central extension of groups\nthe surjective homomorphism\ntogether with the action of \"G\" on \"H\" defines a crossed module. Thus, central extensions can be seen as special crossed modules. Conversely, a crossed module with surjective boundary defines a central extension.\n\nIf (\"X\",\"A\",\"x\") is a pointed pair of topological spaces (i.e. \"A\" is a subspace of \"X,\" and \"x\" is a point in \"A\"), then the homotopy boundary \nfrom the second relative homotopy group to the fundamental group, may be given the structure of crossed module. The functor \nsatisfies a form of the van Kampen theorem, in that it preserves certain colimits.\n\nThe result on the crossed module of a pair can also be phrased as: if\nis a pointed fibration of spaces, then the induced map of fundamental groups\nmay be given the structure of crossed module. This example is useful in algebraic K-theory. There are higher-dimensional versions of this fact using \"n\"-cubes of spaces.\n\nThese examples suggest that crossed modules may be thought of as \"2-dimensional groups\". In fact, this idea can be made precise using category theory. It can be shown that a crossed module is essentially the same as a categorical group or 2-group: that is, a group object in the category of categories, or equivalently a category object in the category of groups. This means that the concept of crossed module is one version of the result of blending the concepts of \"group\" and \"category\". This equivalence is important for higher-dimensional versions of groups.\n\nAny crossed module \nhas a \" classifying space BM \" with the property that its homotopy groups are Coker d, in dimension 1, Ker d in dimension 2, and 0 in dimensions above 2. It is possible to describe the homotopy classes of maps from a CW-complex to \"BM\". This allows one to prove that (pointed, weak) homotopy 2-types are completely described by crossed modules.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1977290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977290", "title": "Kastellet, Copenhagen", "text": "Kastellet, Copenhagen\n\nKastellet, (English: The Citadel) located in Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the best preserved fortresses in Northern Europe. It is constructed in the form of a pentagon with bastions at its corners. Kastellet was continuous with the ring of bastioned ramparts which used to encircle Copenhagen but of which only the ramparts of Christianshavn remain today.\n\nA number of buildings are located within the grounds of Kastellet, including the Kastelskirken (\"Citadel Church\") as well as a windmill. The area houses various military activities but it mainly serves as a public park and a historic site.\n\nKing Christian IV of Denmark initiated Kastellet’s construction in 1626 with the building of an advanced post, the Sankt Annæ Skanse (English: St. Anne's Redoubt), on the coast north of the city. The redoubt guarded the entrance to the port, together with a blockhouse that was constructed north of Christianshavn, which had just been founded on the other side of the strait between Zealand and Amager. At that time the fortifications only reached as far north as present day Nørreport station, and then returned south east to meet the coast at Bremerholm, the Royal Shipyard. However, part of the king's plan was to expand the area of the fortified city by abandoning the old East Rampart and instead extend the rampart straight north to connect it to Sankt Annæ Skanse. This plan was not completed until the mid-1640s, shortly after King Frederick III succeeded King Christian IV.\n\nAfter the Swedish siege of Copenhagen (1658–1660) the Dutch engineer Henrik Rüse was called in to help rebuild and extend the construction. The fortification was named \"Citadellet Frederikshavn\" (\"The Citadel Frederik's harbor\"), but it is better known as Kastellet (\"the citadel\").\n\nKastellet was part of the defence of Copenhagen against the United Kingdom in the Battle of Copenhagen (1807).\n\nChristen Købke (1810–1848), Danish painter associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting, grew up in Kastellet and made many paintings of the area.\n\nDuring the German invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940, German troops landing at the nearby harbor captured The Citadel without resistance.\n\nKastellet was renovated 1989–1999 with funds from the A.P. Møller and Wife Chastine McKinney Møllers General Fund.\n\nThe Citadel has two gates, King's Gate on the south side, facing the city, and Norway Gate on the north side of the edifice, which both date from 1663 as part of Ruise's original citadel. They are built in the Dutch Baroque style, and are on their interior side flanked by guardhouses. The King's Gate is decorated with garlands and pilasters, and a bust of King Frederik III. The clock and two bells on the interior facade of the gate come from the Central Guard House at Kongens Nytorv and were installed in 1874 when the central guard moved to the Citadel. In front of the gate stand two so-called caponiers from where it was possible to keep assaulting troops under fire. The Norway Gate used to face open countryside outside the city, and has therefore been built to a more simple design. The caponiers of this gate were demolished in the late 19th century.\n\nThe five bastions are named as follows: The King's Bastion (Kongens Bastion), The Queen's Bastion (Dronningens Bastion), The Count's Bastion (Grevens Bastion), the Princess's Bastion (Prinsessens Bastion) and the Prince's Bastion (Prinsens Bastion).\n\nSmedelinien (English: The Blacksmith's Line) is a system of outworks, separating the inner and the outer moat, located to the south and southwest towards the city. It consisted of four ravelins and three counter guard interconnected by long, low earthworks. On Fyn's Ravelin, one of the eponymous forges has been preserved and is now used by the park authorities. Another forge was built on Falster's Counter Guard in 1709. Rebuilt in 1888, it now serves as residence of military employees. When the Free Port of Copenhagen was constructed, the northern portion of Smedelinien was dug away, but the remaining part was put at the disposal of the City of Copenhagen in 1918 and now serves as parkland.\n\nThe Commander's House (Danish:Kommandantboligen) served as the residence of the commander of Kastellet. It was built in 1725 in the Baroque style by architect and master builder Elias Häuser who also designed the first Christiansborg Palace which burned in 1794. Built in yellow-dressed masonry with white detailing, it consists of two storeys under a red tile roof. The triangular pediment is decorated with a relief and Christian VII's monogram under topped by a crown. It is now the official residence of the Danish Chief of Defence.\n\nThe Rows (Danish: Stokkene) are six two-storey terraces which were originally built by Henrik Ruise as barracks for the soldiers based at the Citadel. The dorms measured four by four metres and contained two triple beds, a small table and two benches. Over time they became known under individual names: General Stock where the commanders resided until the Commander's House was built, Artillery Stock for the artillerists, and Star Stock, Elephant Stock, Swan Stock and Fortuna Stock. The Mansard roofs are not part of the original design but date from 1768 when the rows were altered. The original roof profile is today only seen at the end of Artillery Row as seen from the Prince's Bastion.\n\nThe two storehouses also date from the foundation of the Citadel. They were to store everything need in the event of a siege, and could when full feed the 1,800 men of the garrison, other personnel, and their families for four years. The Southern Storehouse (Danish: Søndre Magasin) served as an arsenal while the Northern Storehouse (Danish: Nordre Magasin) contained a granary.\n\nThe Powder House at the Queen's Bastion, which was used for the storage of black powder, is the only surviving of originally two identical powder houses which were built by Domenico Pelli in 1712. The other one was located at the Count's Bastion. It was designed with massive walls and a slightly vaulted ceiling to ensure that a possible explosion would move upward and thereby cause a minimum of damages to the surroundings. When in 1779 a powder house at the East Rampart exploded, causing damages in the Nyboder area and all the way to Bredgade, it was decided that it was too dangerous to store explosives at the Ramparts, and the powder houses at the Citadel instead came into use as a jailhouse.\n\nThe Kastelskirken (\"Citadel Church\") was built in 1703–4 in heavy Baroque style during the reign of King Frederik IV. It includes sound holes to the prison to enable prisoners to follow services.\n\nA prison complex was built on the rear side of the church in 1725. Eye holes in the wall between the church and the prison cells made it possible for the prisoners to follow the church services.\n\nStruensee awaited his execution in Kastellet's prison. The English explorer and pirate John Norcross was the person to be imprisoned at Kastellet for the most extensive period. He spent 32 years in the prison at Kastellet, 16 of the years in a wooden cage.\n\nOn the King's Bastion, in the southwestern corner of Kastellet, stands a windmill. Built in 1847, it replaced another mill from 1718 which was destroyed by a storm the year before. The original mill was a post mill while the current mill is of the Dutch type.\n\nSince a fortified city needed secure supplies, including supplies of flour and rolled groats, in the event of siege, numerous windmills were constructed on the bastions. In 1800, a total of 16 windmills were found on the ramparts of Copenhagen. The mill at Kastellet is the last which is still working, while another one, Lille Mølle at the Christianshavn Rampart, was transformed into a private home in 1915 and now survives as a historic house museum.\n\nRussian Empress Consort Maria Feodorovna, daughter of Christian IX of Denmark, got her rye flour from the mill at Kastellet. The Army's Bread Factory would send it to the Imperial Court in Saint Petersburg where she was served øllebrød every morning in the Anichkov Palace.\n\nLocated just inside the King's Gate, the Central Guard House was built from 1873 to 1874 with an attached jailhouse. The architect is unknown. It replaced the Central Guard house at Kongens Nytorv where the Central Guard had been stationed since 1724.\n\nThe Citadel is still an active military area that belongs to the Danish Defence Ministry. Military activity in the area includes use by the Chief of Staff, the Danish Home Guard (\"Hjemmeværnet\"), Military Intelligence (\"Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste\"), the Judge Advocate Corps (\"Forsvarets Auditørkorps\"), and the Royal Garrison Library.\n\nIn spite of the continuous military presence in the area, the Citadel is today a peaceful, protected area, serving as a public park as well as a cultural-historical monument. It is located close to Langelinie, The Little Mermaid, the Gefion Fountain. It is a popular place to go for a walk on a sunny day, and is very popular with children on account of the many animals and birds in the grounds, including Black-headed gull, Pomeranian duck, European herring gull, Grey heron and Mute swan. The site includes two small museums with limited opening hours. The Garrison's Historical Collections are on display in one of the guard buildings inside the North Gate. The other is the \"Livjæger\" Museum.\n\nThere is a changing of the guard ceremony at the Central Guard House every day at 12.00. Military concerts take place at the drill grounds on summer afternoons at 14.00. The Citadel Church frequently arranges concerts as well.\n\nThe Citadel's birthday on 28 October is marked with an annual concert and the wings of the windmill. It is a tradition to promenade on the ramparts on \"Store Bededag\", a Danish holiday, which is also celebrated with music.\n\n"}

During 1958 he designed the Nuclear Disarmament (ND) logo, which was adopted the same year by the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and later became an international peace symbol.\n\nEducated at Gresham's School, Holt, Holtom was a graduate of the Royal College of Art. He had been a conscientious objector during World War II. In 1958 he was working for the Ministry of Education. \n\nOn 21 February 1958 he designed the nuclear disarmament logo for the first Aldermaston March, organised by the Direct Action Committee against Nuclear War (DAC) in Easter 1958 (4–7 April).\n\nThere are differing accounts of how the design was initiated. According to CND, Holtom had been invited by the DAC to design artwork for the Aldermaston March. He showed his preliminary sketches to a DAC meeting in February 1958 at the Peace News offices in North London. According to Christopher Driver, who wrote about CND in a 1964 book, \"The Disarmers\", Holtom brought the design, unsolicited, to the chairperson of his local anti-nuclear group in Twickenham and alternative versions were shown at the inaugural meeting of the London CND. Driver wrote, \"The first mark on paper, according to Mr Holtom, was a white circle within a black square, followed by various versions of the Christian cross within the circle\". But the cross, for these people, had too many wrong associations - with the Crusaders, with military medals, with the public blessing by an American chaplain of the airplane that flew to Hiroshima - and eventually the arms of the cross were depicted as declining, forming the composite semaphore signal for the letters N and D (the letters \"N\" (two arms outstretched pointing down at 45 degrees) and \"D\" (one arm upraised above the head) of the flag semaphore alphabet representing the words nuclear disarmament), and at the same time suggesting a gesture of human despair against the background of a globe. Eric Austen, who adapted the symbol for ceramic lapel badges, is said to have \"discovered that the 'gesture of despair' motif had long been associated with 'the death of man', and the circle with 'the unborn child'\". \n\nThe logo was not copyrighted, and during the 1960s became known to the public as a general-purpose peace symbol. \nIn addition to this primary genesis, Holtom additionally cited as inspiration Goya's Peasant Before the Firing Squad:\n\nI was in despair. Deep despair. I drew myself: the representative of an individual in despair, with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya's peasant before the firing squad. I formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.\n\nThe reference is to Goya's \"The Third of May 1808\" (1814), although the peasant shown in this painting has his arms stretched upwards, not downwards.\n\nHoltom had six children, four with his first wife: Peter, Julia, Anna (now Anna Scott, an artist) and Benjamin; and two with his second wife: Darius and Rebecca (also an artist).\n\n"}

Merrett became a strong and inspirational captain of the Bears, at first alternating in the ruck with Mark Mickan. After John Hutton's inconsistent form at full-forward reached an end, Merrett's tired legs were moved permanently to the position where he was able to use his height and kicking abilities to spearhead the club as their leading goalkicker for many seasons before Alastair Lynch proved a suitable replacement.\n\nHe played on for many years, earning the nickname \"Roger the Dodger\" (with reference to his age) before his eventual retirement.\n\nMerrett held coaching ambitions for much of his career, and on his retirement at the end of the 1996 season, he was immediately recruited by his coach John Northey to fill an assistant coaching role at the Brisbane Lions (formed in 1996 from a merger between the Bears and the Fitzroy Football Club). However, relations between the two men were cool, and half-way through the 1998 season, with the Lions at the bottom of the ladder, Northey was sacked as coach and Merrett was asked to be caretaker coach for the rest of the year.

In some academic institutions the term is used for a presentation by a teaching assistant or instructor, under the guidance of a senior faculty member, that supplements course materials. In recitations that supplement lectures, the leader will often review the lecture, expand on the concepts, and carry on a discussion with the students.\n\nIn its most basic form, a student would recite verbatim poems or essays of others, either to the teacher or tutor directly, or in front of a class or body of assembled students.\n\nIn classes involving mathematics and engineering, a recitation is often used as the vehicle to perform derivations or solve problems similar to those assigned to the students.\n\nScientific classes, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, often employ the use of recitation sections to help students clarify subject matter that was either not fully understood or inadequately addressed in the limited time of lecture. These recitation sections may be conducted by the professor or a student teaching assistant. These sections provide students with an opportunity to receive additional instruction on confusing subject matter or receive personal assistance with problems or questions assigned as homework in the lecture section. Some universities may require attendance at regularly scheduled recitation sections in addition to any required labs. Recitations may also provide students with additional opportunities for receiving grades for the lecture portion of the course. Despite mandatory attendance and additional time spent in the classroom, these sections usually do not count towards university credits required for graduation, but may significantly increase a student's ability to understand important concepts required to pass the course.\n\nRecitations of holy scriptures and prayers are common in the liturgies of Abrahamic religions.\n\nRecitation is practiced as a performing art especially in Bangladesh and India. Nowadays it is a popular art form in Bengal. The reciters recite Bengali poems on stage and electronic media. Shambhu Mitra, Kazi Sabyasachi, Pradeep Ghosh, Partha Ghhosh, Gauri Ghosh, Utpal Kundu are great reciters from West Bengal. Reciters like Samiran Sanyal, Bratati Bandyopadhyay, Bijoylakshmi Burman, Pinaki Chattopadhyay,Sutapa Bandyopadhyay, Urmimala Basu, Samya Karpha to name a few, are contributing significantly in this field. There are many such organizations of recitation, with most located in Bangladesh.\n\nIt was often popular for a poet to recite his or her newly-created poetry to an audience. In the early twentieth century, recitation developed into an autonomous art form.\n\nRecitationes were a common way for Roman poets to test and publicize their works.\n\n"}

She is an inductee into the AVN, XRCO, and NightMoves Halls of Fame.\n\nIreland was born on May 26, 1970, in Longmont, Colorado, a small community outside Denver. She grew up a good student until her parents divorced when she was 13. At 15, she became rebellious and started taking recreational drugs, until her father sent her to live with her mother, who had remarried, in San Diego, California. In San Diego, Ireland returned to getting good grades, graduated high school, and started college, majoring in broadcast journalism. While going to high school and college, Ireland worked part-time ordering videos for a chain of video stores, which she credits for learning a lot about pornographic films.\n\nIreland returned to Colorado to continue college partially in Boulder, Colorado, partially in Fort Collins, Colorado, and began to dance in a Fort Collins strip club. One of her first female lovers was a waitress at the same club who would become the pornographic actress Juli Ashton.\n\nShe entered the pornographic film industry in 1994, through an acquaintance with glamour photographer Warren Tang. Her first films were \"L'il Ms. Behaved\", where she performed with Randy West, and \"Up & Cummers 10\", with Jenna Jameson; she started at the same time as Jameson. Ireland moved to Los Angeles after her first five films, and performed in a total of 80 films her first year, before returning to Colorado intending to slow down her film work.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Ireland performed in exclusive contracts, starring in a few films per year, while traveling across America and Europe, strip tease dancing and promoting her films. Her first contract, with Sin City Entertainment, was brief, and ended in a breach of contract small claims court lawsuit which went before \"Judge Judy\" on television; Ireland won. That was followed by a five-year contract with VCA Pictures. Ireland served as VCA's Director of Publicity from 1999 to 2000, before returning to performing freelance. Demonstrating that no hard feelings remained about the lawsuit, she had a one-month stint as Director of Publicity for Sin City in April 2003.

This would be the first of many adult film awards. Fans of X-Rated Entertainment awarded her the 'Vixen' award in 1995 and the 'Fan Favorite' in 1996. She was named by \"Playboy\" Magazine as one of their Top 10 Porn Stars for 1997. In 2001, AVN listed her among the Top 50 Porn Stars of All Time and in 2005 inducted her into the AVN Hall of Fame.\n\nWhen her contract with VCA expired, Ireland directed her first movie, \"The Whore Next Door\". Ireland continued to direct, first for Jewel De'Nyle at Platinum X Pictures, then other companies. In April 2006, she founded her own adult film company, SlutWerkz, which features women directors and Cross as head of production, producing, and starring in hardcore gonzo pornography. SlutWerkz launch was delayed from its planned fall 2007 to sometime in 2008 after replacing the original intended distributors. The company originally planned to release one film per month.\n\nIreland started her personal website, http://www.kylieireland.com, in 1996, becoming one of the first pornographic actresses on the Web; she describes it as \"my obsession.\" On her website, she would perform live sex shows that would receive 10,000 hit a day at $5 a hit during the late 1990s. She does Web consulting and public relations for other adult actresses.\n\nFrom October 2003 to February 2006, Ireland hosted a weekly Internet radio show, \"Kylie Live\" on ksexradio.com, about the pornography industry. She won the KSEX Radio Listener's Choice Award for \"Best Radio Voice\" in 2004, and the \"Best Insight into the Adult Business\" award for 2005. In February 2006, Ireland became the host of sex talk show \"Private Calls\", on Friday evenings for Playboy Radio on Sirius Radio.\n\nIn November 2010, Ireland launched a new weekend show on Spice radio called The Jerkbox. The show took over where \"The Friday Night Threeway\" left off. It features guest interviews, segments revolving around the world of sex and porn-related topics.\n\nAround January 2011, Ireland started a website called Bombed Out LA along with her husband, which uses her love of photography to capture and publish street art in Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 2011, it was discovered after a television interview that Ireland was also street artist DeeKay.\n\nIn January 2013, after leaving Spice radio, Ireland joined the Toadhopnetwork and began \"The Wednesday Night Threeway\", a weekly podcast with Raylene and Derrick Pierce.\n\nIn April 2013, Ireland launched her own weekly podcast channel along with her husband Andy Appleton called \"Apples & Pairs\" on Soundcloud.com.\n\nIreland got divorced after a ten-year marriage to a man outside of porn. They had been married three years prior to the start of her career in pornography, and she stated that the divorce was not due to her career.\n\nIreland says that she \"dabbled\" in recreational drugs, even before entering the adult industry; she tried most drugs, and used crystal meth for a time to stay thin, but her main drug of choice was alcohol. In 2001, she realized her drinking was becoming a problem.\n\nAs of 2007, Ireland lived in a renovated 1927 warehouse loft in downtown Los Angeles with pornographic director Eli Cross, her boyfriend of six years.\n\nIn 2010, Ireland and Eli split up and she later married English retired nightclub manager Andy Appleton.

It results in a limited ability to move the neck and shortness of the neck, resulting in the appearance of a low hairline.\n\nThe syndrome is difficult to diagnose, as it occurs in a group of patients affected with many different abnormalities who can only be unified by the presence of fused or segmental cervical vertebrae. KFS is not always genetic and not always known the day of the birth.\n\nThe disease was initially reported in 1884 by Maurice Klippel and André Feil from France. In 1919, in his Doctor of Philosophy thesis, André Feil suggested another classification of the syndrome, encompassing not only deformation of the cervical spine, but also deformation of the lumbar and thoracic spine.\n\nKFS is associated with many other abnormalities of the body, hence thorough evaluation of all patients with fused cervical vertebrae at birth is required. Furthermore, it is unclear whether KFS is a unique disease, or if it is one part of a spectrum of congenital spinal deformities.\n\nKFS is usually diagnosed after birth. The most common signs of the disorder are restricted mobility of the neck and upper spine and a shortened neck with the appearance of a low hairline at the back of the head.\n\nAssociated abnormalities may include:\n\n\nThe disorder also may be associated with abnormalities of the head and face, skeleton, sex organs, muscles, brain and spinal cord, arms, legs and fingers.\n\nMutations of the \"GDF6\", \"GDF3\" and \"MEOX1\" gene are associated with KFS. The cause of the condition is unknown in individuals with KFS who do not have mutations of these two genes. \"GDF6\" and \"GDF3\" provide the body with instructions for making proteins involved in regulating the growth and maturation of bone and cartilage. \"GDF6\" specifically is involved in the formation of vertebral bones, among others, and establishing boundaries between bones in skeletal development. \"GDF3\" is involved with bone and cartilage growth. Mutations of \"GDF6,\" \"GDF3\" and \"MEOX1\" cause a reduced number of functional proteins that are coded by these genes, but it is unclear exactly how a shortage in these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the vertebrae in people with KFS. However, when the \"GDF6\" gene was removed in mice, the result was the fusion of bones.\n\nThese mutations can be inherited in two ways:\n\n\nThe heterogeneity of KFS has made it difficult to outline the diagnosis as well as the prognosis for this disease.\n\nIn 1912, Maurice Klippel and Andre Feil independently provided the first descriptions of KFS. They described patients who had a short, webbed neck; decreased range of motion (ROM) in the cervical spine; and a low hairline. Feil subsequently classified the syndrome into 3 categories:\n\n\nA classification scheme for KFS was proposed in 1919 by Andre Feil, which accounted for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine malformations.\n\nHowever, in 2006, Dino Samartzis and colleagues proposed three classification-types that specifically addressed the cervical spine anomalies and their associated cervical spine-related symptoms, with additional elaboration on various time-dependent factors regarding this syndrome.\n\nTreatment for KFS is symptomatic and may include surgery to relieve cervical or craniocervical instability and constriction of the spinal cord, and to correct scoliosis.\n\nIf symptomatic treatment fails, spinal surgery may provide relief. Adjacent segment disease and scoliosis are two examples of common symptoms associated with Klippel–Feil syndrome, and they may be treated surgically. The three categories treated for types of spinal cord deficiencies are massive fusion of the cervical spine (Type I), the fusion of 1 or 2 vertebrae (Type II), and the presence of thoracic and lumbar spine anomalies in association with type I or type II Klippel–Feil syndrome (Type III).\n\nAdjacent segment disease can be addressed by performing cervical disc arthroplasty using a device such as the Bryan cervical disc prosthesis. The option of the surgery is to maintain range of motion and attenuate the rate of adjacent segment disease advancement without fusion. Another type of arthroplasty that is becoming an alternate choice to spinal fusion is Total Disc Replacement. Total disc replacement objective is to reduce pain or eradicate it. Spinal fusion is commonly used to correct spinal deformities such as scoliosis. Arthrodesis is the last resort in pain relieving procedures, usually when arthroplasties fail.\n\nThe prognosis for most individuals with KFS is good if the disorder is treated early and appropriately. Activities that can injure the neck should be avoided, as it may contribute to further damage. Other diseases associated with the syndrome can be fatal if not treated, or if found too late to be treatable.\n\nHeart defects often lead to a shortened life expectancy, the average being 35–45 years of age among males and 40–50 among females. This condition is similar to the heart failure seen in gigantism.\n\nThe prevalence of KFS is unknown due to the lack of studies to determine its prevalence.

This Part also places further restrictions on Students' Unions by requiring that affiliation to external organizations must be voted on at referendum if 5% of the membership requests a referendum and restricts the time a sabbatical officer can serve to two years. It also stipulates that a students' union must be governed democratically and must be accountable for its finances.\n\nThere are various other clauses about the finances and external affiliations of students' unions.\n\nSection 22 of the Act requires that \"the procedure for allocating resources to groups or clubs should be fair and should be set down in writing and freely accessible to all students\". This has generated some controversy because of the way it can be interpreted. Some assert that it requires all university societies that draw on students' union funding to be open to membership by all students, whilst others assert that this does not explicitly prevent a society of a students' union from restricting its membership to those who share the aims and purposes of the society.\n\n"}

It is engaged in the food trade, the home and specialty goods trade, the building and home improvement trade, and the car and machinery trade. It also has subsidiaries in Sweden, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus.\nThe key focus areas in Kesko's business operations are to strengthen sales growth and the return on capital in all divisions, to exploit business opportunities in e-commerce and in Russia, and to maintain good solvency and dividend payment capacity.\n\nKesko was formed when four regional wholesaling companies that had been founded by retailers were merged in October 1940.\n\nThe new Kesko company started operating at the beginning of 1941. The need to purchase goods for the shareholder-retailers and to support their business operations and start cooperation among them resulted in the forming of the K-retailer group.\n\nBy the end of the 1940s, Kesko's sales amounted to about 15 billion old Finnish markkas (equivalent to EUR 580 million in 2010), which was about 12% of the overall sales of the central companies operating in the Finnish trading sector.\n\nKesko Food is a key operator in the Finnish grocery trade. Kesko Food's main functions include the centralised purchasing of products, selection management, logistics, and the development of chain concepts and the store network.\n\nKesko Food manages the K-food store chains, which are K-Market, K-Supermarket and K-Citymarket. There were 937 K-food stores in Finland in 2012. The K-food store network is comprehensive in Finland and approximately 50% of Finns live less than a kilometre away from a K-food store.\n\nFormerly Kesko called these four size-grades of their shops K (small), KK (middle-sized), KKK (large), and KKKK (largest), and the chain names were K Extra, K Lähikauppa (= \"local shop\"), KK Market, KKK Supermarket and KKKK Citymarket; but this naming system has been changed.\n\nKesko Food's private brands include Pirkka, K-menu and Euro Shopper.\n\nThe main competitors are Prisma, S-market and Alepa/Sale of S Group, M chain stores, and Lidl.\n\nKesko Food's subsidiary Kespro is the leading wholesaler in the Finnish HoReCa business.\n\nKesko also has small convenience stores, cafes and restaurants which operate at manned service stations of Neste oil corporation. These service station facilities are branded as Neste K. The convenience store is virtually always found in Neste K station, while whether the station has a cafe or restaurant depends on the size and location of the station. Cafes are branded as Koon Kahvila and restaurants as Koon Keittiö.\n\nThe home and specialty goods trade comprises K-citymarket's home and speciality goods, Intersport Finland and Kenkäkesko.\n\nKesko's home and specialty goods trade operates in the clothing, home, sports and home technology product lines.\n\nThe most widely recognised chains are:\n\nRautakesko is an international service provider which retails building, renovation and home improvement supplies in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Belarus.\n\nRautakesko manages and develops the K-Rauta, K-maatalous, Byggmakker, Senukai and OMA retail chains and B2B sales in its operating area.\n\nRautakesko's main functions include the centralised development of chain selections, centralised purchasing and logistics, and the development of chain concepts and the store network.\n\nAll stores in Finland are owned by retailer entrepreneurs. There are also approximately 100 retailer-owned stores in Norway. Rautakesko's international business model combines the category management, purchasing, logistics, information system control and network improvements of the company's chains which operate in different countries.\n\nThe car and machinery trade segment consists of K-Auto (formerly operated as VV-Auto) and Konekesko with their subsidiaries.\n\nK-Auto and Konekesko represent the leading brands in their market area and are responsible for the sales and after-sales services of these brands either through their own or dealer network. The dealer network is complemented by a network of contract service centres.\n\nIn 2014, Kesko's market share in food trade in Finland was 33.1% (Nielsen).\n\nKesko's competitors in food trade in 2014 were Prisma, S-market and Alepa/Sale of S Group (45.7%), Lidl (7.6%) Valintatalo, Siwa and Euromarket of Suomen Lähikauppa Oy (6.8%) and M chain stores (Nielsen). Kesko later acquired Suomen Lähikauppa in 2016 and the deal increased Kesko's share of the market to about estimated 40%.\n\nIn April 2016 Kesko completed the acquisition of a competitor Suomen Lähikauppa's stores. In the deal, Kesko acquired all the Valintatalo and Siwa stores. However the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA) approved the acquisition with a condition that Kesko must sell at least 60 of the stores to competitors. All the Siwas and Valintatalos have been rebranded as K-Market stores as of 2017. The total number of stores owned by Suomen Lähikauppa before the acquisition was 643 and it employed 4100 employees. In the same acquisition Kesko also was initially obligated to keep using Tuko Logistics Cooperative as the main supplier for the bought stores for 18 months, but FCCA later revoked this decision on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977361", "title": "David Rosenhan", "text": "David Rosenhan\n\nDavid L. Rosenhan (; November 22, 1929 – February 6, 2012) was an American psychologist. He is best known for the Rosenhan experiment, a study challenging the validity of psychiatry diagnoses. Subsequent research has cast doubt on the experiment's veracity and outcomes.\n\nRosenhan received his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1951 from Yeshiva College, his master's degree in economics in 1953 and his doctorate in psychology in 1958, both from Columbia University. As further described in his obituary published by the American Psychological Association (APA), \"Rosenhan was a pioneer in applying psychological methods to the practice of law, including the examination of expert witnesses, jury selection, and jury deliberation.\" He wasa professor of law and of psychology at Stanford University from 1971 until his retirement in 1998... Before joining the Stanford Law School faculty, he was a member of the faculties of Swarthmore College, Princeton University, Haverford College, and the University of Pennsylvania. He also served as a research psychologist at the Educational Testing Service. He later became a professor emeritus in law and psychology at Stanford University. Rosenhan was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and various psychological societies, including the APA, and had been a visiting fellow at Wolfson College at Oxford University.\n\nRosenhan died on February 6, 2012, at the age of 82.\n\nRosenhan believed that there are seven main features of abnormality: suffering; maladaptiveness; vividness and unconventionality; unpredictability and loss of control; irrationality and incomprehensibility; observer discomfort; and violation of moral and ideal standards.\n\nIn 1973 Rosenhan published \"On Being Sane in Insane Places\", which describes what is now called the Rosenhan experiment. In this study report, Rosenhan uses \"hard labeling\" to argue that mental illnesses are manifested solely as a result of societal influence. The study experiments arranged for eight individuals with no history of psychopathology to attempt admission into twelve psychiatric hospitals, all with an aim for and subsequent admission with diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The report goes on to describe psychiatrists then attempting to treat the individuals using psychiatric medications; all eight were described as being self-discharged within 7 to 52 days, after having stated that they accepted their diagnosis. Later, a research and teaching hospital challenged Rosenhan to run a similar experiment involving its own diagnosis and admission procedures, where psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their institution. In that study, 83 out of 193 new patients were believed by at least one staff member to be actors; in fact, Rosenhan reports having sent no actors. The study concluded that existing forms of diagnosis were grossly inaccurate in distinguishing individuals without mental disorders from those with mental disorders, a conclusion that resulted in an explosion of controversy. The Rosenhan experiment can be described as addressing the relationship between psychiatric and medical diagnoses and labeling theory, theorising that deviance is a product of external judgements, or labels, that can modify an individual’s self-identity and change the way others respond to the labeled person. In this description, by negatively labeling those seen as deviant from standard cultural norms, the behavior of individuals may be adjusted to coincide with the terms used to describe them. In short, by actively labeling certain acts as deviant and others as normal, distinct stereotypes are created. \n\nIn a 2019 popular book on Rosenhan by author Susannah Cahalan, \"The Great Pretender\", the veracity and validity of the Rosenhan experiment was questioned; Cahalan argues that Rosenhan never published further work on the experiment's data, nor did he deliver on a book on it that he had promised. Moreover, she presents her inability to find the experiment's subjects, save two—a Stanford graduate student who had experiences similar to Rosenhan's, and one whose positive psychiatric hospital experience was excluded from the published results. As noted by Alison Abbott in a review of the book in the journal \"Nature\", Kenneth J. Gergen, a Stanford University colleague stated that \"some people in the department called him a bullshitter', a conclusion with which Cahalan appeared to be in agreement, although, Abbott writes, \"[s]he cannot be completely certain that Rosenhan cheated. But she is confident enough to call her engrossing, dismaying book \"The Great Pretender\".\"\n\nFurther pseudo-patient studies in the vein of Rosenhan have met with significant methodologic and other concerns.\n\n\n"}

Tephrite is foidal basalt with essential calic plagioclase but without essential olivine. It is essentially the volcanic equivalent of essexite. The discovery of theralite was looked forward to with interest as completing the series of basic rocks containing nepheline as an essential constituent.\n\nWith the increase in silica (SiO) and the concomitant reduction in nepheline, theralite becomes gabbro. With a decrease in silica and reduction in olivine theralite grades into teschenite and with the addition of sodic feldspar, grades into essexite. With a further reduction in silica such that there is no feldspar these rocks become melteigites. With the addition of alkali feldspar replacing or becoming more dominant than calcic plagioclase theralites grade into foidal syenite, including shonkinite. \n\nProperly theralite is only for a specific type of calcic foidal gabbro, those with essential nepheline and without essential analcime or sodic feldspar.\n\nTeschenites were once considered part of the theralite group. They contain essential pyroxene, olivine and analcime.\n\nModern petrology would classify the teschenites as an analcime bearing gabbro. They are petrogenetically unrelated to nepheline gabbros as analcime is not produced by the same genetic processes.\n\nEssexite is a form of silica-undersaturated pyroxene gabbro, containing nepheline and orthoclase as essential constituents, though often in small proportions. Essexites can be considered to represent the intrusive equivalent of an alkaline basalt. \n\nEssexites are usually associated with other alkaline, silica undersaturated to monzonitic intrusive rocks and coeval high-alumina basalts.\n\nEssexites are no longer considered part of the theralite group and are more properly known as \"nepheline monzogabbro\" or \"nepheline monzodiorite\". The presence of orthoclase indicates a petrogenetic difference with nepheline gabbros. \n\n"}

{"id": "1977376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977376", "title": "Law enforcement in Italy", "text": "Law enforcement in Italy\n\nLaw enforcement in Italy is an exclusive duty of the State, with policing centralized on a national level. It is generally provided by three national agencies with full powers, and by other local forces carrying out restricted and limited duties. The two main police forces in the country are the Carabinieri, the national gendarmerie, and the Polizia di Stato, the civil national police. The third one is the Guardia di Finanza, a militarized police force responsible for dealing with financial crime, smuggling and illegal drug trade.\n\nThey are managed on a provincial level under the authority of the Questore (the local head of police) in accord with the Prefetto, the provincial representative of the Government.\n\nLaw enforcement in Italy is an exclusive function of the State and is organized under the Ministry of Interior, with provincial division and jurisdiction. The highest office in charge of law enforcement is the multi-agency \"Dipartimento della Pubblica Sicurezza\". \n\nThe Ministero dell'Interno (Ministry of the Interior) is the government department with oversight of all of the national forces. On a local level, the forces are under the provincial authority of the Prefetto, in collaboration with the Questore (the local chief of the Polizia), that have their offices Prefettura and Questura in every province capital. These offices are in charge of organizing public safety as well as of carrying law-required duties. \n\nFor these reasons, the main police force in Italy is Polizia di Stato, or simply Polizia, which is a nationwide, full-powered agency, with different divisions for each specialized area of interest. The Polizia's duties may vary from traffic patrol to investigation, forensic analysis, or riot control. This civilian agency is generally distributed from the medium to large cities up to the province capital, even though exceptions may exist with offices and/or stations in critical towns or in places of interest.\n\nThe same duties are carried out also by Arma dei Carabinieri, commonly known as ‘’Carabinieri’’, which are also Military Police for the Italian Armed Forces. Also, generally Carabinieri is also in charge of investigation or intervention inside Public Administrations and personal right violation, but mainly because of their history as “defender of the Constitution (It is not by chance that the President of Republic safety corps is a special section of Carabinieri called Corazzieri). For this last reason, Carabinieri stations are usually distributed all over the country, with a station approximately in every municipality (or at least every range of 5km), with additional stations in strategical positions in the motorways. \n\nEven though in cases of emergency both Polizia or Carabinieri may be called upon or may intervene, strong differences underline the two agencies: Carabinieri is more an investigation/law break control corps, while Polizia also includes a number of bureaucratic duties around visas, passports, licenses, registration of tourists from hotels, and so on. Moreover in less-populated areas or areas far away from cities, usually the main force is Carabinieri. \n\nOther national forces generally focus on specific and distinguished duties. For example, Guardia di Finanza is the finance and economy police (or roughly Customs, Excise and Fraud squad) and is essentially responsible for dealing with financial crime and smuggling; it has also evolved into Italy's primary agency for suppressing the illegal drug trade. It is a military force which maintains over 600 boats and ships and more than 100 aircraft to serve in its mission of patrolling Italy's territorial waters.\n\nThe ‘’Polizia Penitenziaria’’ is the national prison guard agency. Only in 2016 the environment and the forestry police guard called the \"Corpo Forestale dello Stato,\" was absorbed into the Carabinieri, taking the number of national police forces from five to four. \n\nItaly divides law enforcement into Military and Civil forces, distinguishing each \"agency\" by duties and jurisdictions. All law enforcement officers are considered \"Pubblici Ufficiali\" [Public Functionaries] and but not all officers belonging to police forces are \"Agenti di Pubblica Sicurezza\" [Public Safety officers] as the latter gives the authority to arrest, investigate and patrol in the whole national territory and in all situations.\n\nIn a different way from other countries (such as the United States), Italy does not have multiple specialized agencies for immigration, drug offenses, patrolling etc, but each “area” is investigated by a dedicated section of each national agency. For example, the Polizia Stradale [highway patrol] is a role within the Polizia, with focus on patrolling the roads and various crimes committed on national and local roads. Therefore, crimes covering multiple \"areas\" do not need to be covered by multiple agencies.\n\nBorder and Maritime patrolling are undertaken by the Guardia di Finanza and Guardia Costiera [Coast Guard]. Officers of the Guardia Costiera, who are members of the Italian Navy, do not have the same range of powers as the Polizia, Carabinieri or Guardia di Finanza, and they should be considered as a \"specialty\" of the Navy more than \"police officers\". Nevertheless, they are in charge of policing and patrolling seaside regulations and laws, both beachside and on water. \n\nOn a town level the head of Public Safety is the Mayor. \nMunicipal officers work on minor crimes on a local basis, from traffic offenses to small-time drug dealing and illegal camping. Each town or city has its own police department but they have limited jurisdiction and duties. Local officers can check driving licenses, enforce municipal laws and ordinances and carry out investigations for robberies and minor offenses, but they cannot form a \"riot squad\" or interfere with homicide or general investigations by the Police or Carabinieri.\n\nEach Polizia Locale is under the authority of the respective local mayor, but the officers' mandate is valid only during their working hours and within the area their force covers, whereas Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato and Guardia di Finanza are always formally \"on duty\", wherever they are and regardless of whether they are at work.\n\nIn 2005, the total number of active police officers in all of the agencies was 324,339 in Italy, the highest number in the European Union both overall and per capita, twice the number of agents in the similarly sized United Kingdom. However, this number includes every officer of the Arma dei Carabinieri, one of the four arms of the Italian Armed Forces, which includes roles which in other countries would not necessarily be considered to be police officers. For example, it has a department akin to workplace inspectors, Carabinieri della tutela del lavoro, one tasked with ensuring proper standards are being met within the food and drink production, Carabinieri per la tutela della salute, another tasked with the protection of Art and Cultural Patrimony. Carabinieri per la tutela del Patrimonio\n\nThe \"Polizia di Stato\" (State Police) is the civil national police of Italy. Along with patrolling, investigative and law enforcement duties, it patrols the Autostrada (Italy's Express Highway network), and oversees the security of railways, bridges, and waterways.\n\nIt is a civilian police force, while the \"Carabinieri\" and the \"Guardia di Finanza\" are military. While its internal organization and mindset are somewhat military, its personnel is composed of civilians. Its headquarters are in Rome, and there are Regional and Provincial divisions throughout the Italian territory.\n\nInterpol summarizes the primary focus of the Polizia di Stato (Ministry of Interior): \"Its responsibilities include investigative and law enforcement duties, and the security of motorway, railway, and waterway networks\". \n\nEuropol (the EU's law enforcement agency), provides this summary of the force's responsibilities: \"protecting the state, safeguarding the rights and freedoms of citizens, supervising the maintenance of public order, maintaining public safety, providing assistance to public entities and private in the event of accidents and disasters as well as the peaceful resolution of disputes between private individuals. It also deals with the training and education, at its facilities, of members of other police bodies... specialty departments include the Traffic, Railway, Communications Police, the Mobile Departments and the Scientific Police.\n\nA program \"Polizia di Quartiere\" (Quarter Police) has been implemented which increases police presence and deters crime. Pairs of \"poliziotti\" (policemen) or \"carabinieri\" patrol areas of major cities on foot.\n\nThe \"Guardia di Finanza\", () is a military corps under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with a role as a police force.\n\nThe Corps is in charge of financial, economic, judiciary and public safety: tax evasion, financial crimes, smuggling, money laundering, international illegal drug trafficking, illegal immigration, customs and borders checks, copyright violations, anti-Mafia operations, credit card fraud, cybercrime, counterfeiting, terrorist financing, maintaining public order, and safety, political and military defense of the Italian borders.\n\nInterpol summarizes the primary focus Guardia di Finanza (Ministry of Economy and Finance) as \"a force with military status and nationwide remit for financial crime investigations; Its responsibilities include investigative and law enforcement duties, and the security of motorway, railway, and waterway networks\". \nEuropol (the EU's law enforcement agency), provides this summary: \"organized according to a military structure ... the tasks of the Guardia di Finanza consist of the prevention, search and denunciation of evasions and financial violations, in the supervision of the observance of the provisions of political and economic interest and in the surveillance at sea for financial police purposes. ... it also contributes to the maintenance of order and public security, to military defense along national borders for the illegal drug trade \". \n\nThe \"Guardia di Finanza\" has a strength of around 68,000 soldiers working as agents, NCOs and officers. Its militaries are in service in the Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office. Its Latin motto since 1933 is \"Nec recisa recedit\" (). The \"Guardia di Finanza\" also maintains over 600 boats and ships and more than 100 aircraft to fulfill its mission of patrolling Italy's territorial waters.\n\nDuring demonstrations and very big events, the \"Guardia di Finanza\" is often called on duty as riot police.\n\nThe \"Carabinieri\" is the common name for the \"Arma dei Carabinieri\", a \"Gendarmerie\"-like military corps with police duties. They also serve as the military police for the Italian armed forces.\n\nInterpol summarizes this force (part of the Ministry of Defence), with military status, as having \"nationwide remit for crime investigations. It also serves as the military police for the Italian armed forces and can be called upon for national defence action.\" According to Europol (the EU's law enforcement agency), the Carabinieri Corps' military duties include \"contributing to national defense, participating in military operations in Italy and abroad, executing military police functions and ensuring the security of Italian diplomatic and consular representations\". As a national police force, it \"carries out public order and security policing, as well as investigative activities on its own initiative or at the request of the judicial authorities\". \n\nThe \"Carabinieri\" have become a separate armed force (alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force), thus ending their long-standing tradition as the First Corps (\"Arma\") of the Italian Army (\"Esercito\"). They are referred to as the \"Arma\" or \"La Benemerita\" (The Meritorious Corps).\n\n\"Carabinieri\" units have been dispatched all over the world in peacekeeping missions, including Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn November 2003, twelve \"Carabinieri\" were killed in a suicide bomb attack on their base in Nasiriyah, in southern Iraq. This was Italy's largest military loss in a single action since World War II.\n\nUntil 2001, only men were allowed to become part of the \"Arma\" (or any military force, for that matter), but military reforms allow women to serve in the Italian military, including \"Carabinieri\".\n\nHaving both military police duties and civil police duties, the \"Arma\" is usually called on duty as riot police during big events and demonstrations.\n\nAccording to Europol, this force has \"4,672 stations and lieutenancies\".\n\nThe \"Polizia Penitenziaria\" (Prison Guards, literally \"Penitentiary Police\", also translated as \"Prison Police Corps\") operates the Italian prison system and handles the transportation of inmates. The training academies for the \"Polizia Penitenziaria\" are located in Aversa, Monastir, Cairo Montenotte, Castiglione delle Stiviere, Parma, Portici, Rome, San Pietro Clarenza, Verbania and Sulmona.\n\nIts agents are sometimes called to help the other police forces during major events.\n\nAccording to Interpol, this force (part of the Ministry of Justice) has a \"nationwide remit for prison security, inmate safety and transportation\". Europol (the EU's law enforcement agency), provides more specifics as to the corps' responsibilities: to \"ensure order and security inside and outside the buildings, preventing unauthorized entry or exit. In addition, they manage to organize and educate for inmates, and provide transport, escort and guard services for prisoners. The Corps has its own marine service and dog and horse units. Finally, the Penitentiary Police can be deployed to carry out public order and security functions, including public rescue, in cases where they are required to help provide specific civil protection\".\n\nThe \"Corpo Forestale dello Stato\" (National Forestry Department, now dissolved) was responsible for law enforcement in Italian national parks and forests. Their duties included enforcing poaching laws, safeguarding protected animal species and preventing forest fires.\nFounded in 1822, the \"Corpo Forestale dello Stato\" was a civilian police force specialized on the environmental protection. A recent law reform expanded its duties to food controls.\nIn Italy, it had the responsibility to manage the activities related to the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).\nThe Autonomous Region of Sardinia has its own corp of forestry police.\n\nCorpo Forestale dello Stato was dissolved on December 31, 2016 and all personnel become militarized and absorbed into the Carabinieri's \"Comando unità per la tutela forestale, ambientale e agroalimentare\".\n\nThe \"Direzione Investigativa Antimafia\" (or \"DIA\") (Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate) is a joint organization of \"Polizia di Stato\", \"Carabinieri\", \"Polizia Penitenziaria\" and \"Guardia di Finanza\" for the fight against organized crime. \nFounded in 1991, under the authority of the Minister of Interior as the \"Direzione Nazionale Antimafia\" (National Anti-Mafia Directorate). Its operations include preemptive investigations, judicial investigations, and international relations, and it investigates characteristics, objectives, and methods of the Mafia as well as their domestic and international contacts. The \"DIA\" was to prevent mafiosi from infiltrating the government.\n\nInterpol's National Central Bureau for Italy is part of the International Police Cooperation Service (SCIP), a branch of the Public Security Department (PSD). \"SCIP is a multi-agency DPS unit: the Polizia di Stato, Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza head it, on a rotation basis. Officers representing all police forces staff it\", the agency states. \n\nThe \"Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga\" (Central Directorate for Anti-Drug Services) is a joint organization of \"Polizia di Stato\", \"Carabinieri\" and \"Guardia di Finanza\" for the fight against drug trafficking. Founded in 1976 as \"Direzione Anti Droga\" (Anti-Drug Directorate), is under the authority of the Criminal police department of the Minister of Interior.\n\nThe \"Polizia Provinciale\" (Provincial Police) is local police only used in some of the 109 Provinces of Italy. Their main tasks are to enforce regional and national hunting and fishing laws, but have also expanded in wildlife management and environmental protection. Carries traffic police service and participates in the security services arranged by the authorities.\n\nIn addition, each comune has its own \"Polizia Municipale\" (Municipal Police) whose main duty is to enforce local regulations and traffic laws; it also deals with petty crimes but in larger cities they cooperate with the national police forces to prevent and repress major crimes. Depending on their location they are also called \"Polizia Municipale\", \"Polizia Locale\", \"Polizia Comunale\" or \"Polizia Urbana\".\n\nIn some regions \"Polizia Provinciale\" and \"Polizia Municipale\" are grouped together under the name \"Polizia Locale\" (Local Police), although they keep their own internal organisation. Small communes can merge their local police forces in a consortium.\n\nBoth provincial and municipal forces are reliant on the State Police for scientific support and other forms of assistance.\n\nThe \"Organizzazione di Vigilanza Repressione dell'Antifascismo\" (or \"OVRA\") (English: Organization for Vigilance in Repression of Anti-Fascism) was a secret police organization in Italy during fascism.\n\nThe \"Polizia dell'Africa Italiana\" or \"PAI\" (Police of Italian Africa) (1936–1944).\n\nThe \"Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana\" or \"GNR\" (National Republic Guard) was a paramilitary force of the Italian Social Republic created by decree on December 8, 1943, replacing the \"Carabinieri\" and the \"MVSN\".\n\n\"Zaptié\" were locally raised gendarmerie units in the Italian colonies of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Colonia Primigenia and Somalia between 1889 and 1942.\n\nZaptié were used during the period of Trust Territory of Somaliland from 1950 to 1960. Members were sent to Italy to train and after 1960 the merged into the Somali Police Force.\n\n all Italian police forces were equipped with Italian-made police cars, with FIAT and Alfa Romeos most common. The most famous of them, the Alfa Romeo Giulia, gave the nicknames of the cars still commonly used today. A patrol car belonging to \"Polizia\" is nicknamed \"Pantera\" (Panther), one used by the \"Carabinieri\" is nicknamed \"Gazzella\" (Gazelle) and every unmarked car is called a \"Civetta\" (Owl).\n\nEvery force has helicopters, trucks and campers (used as mobile offices, usually in undercover missions).\nIn Venice, which is built across several islands linked by bridges and surrounded by water, public security and fire brigades work with boats.\nIn 2004, Lamborghini donated two Lamborghini Gallardo police cars to the \"Polizia di Stato\" on their 152nd anniversary. On the 31st November 2009 one of these supercars was badly damaged in a collision near the northern Italian town of Cremona where it was on display at a student jobs fair. The car apparently swerved to avoid another vehicle crossing its path and collided with two stationary vehicles; it was repaired in January 2010.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977383", "title": "Boston Police Strike", "text": "Boston Police Strike\n\nIn the Boston Police Strike, Boston police officers went on strike on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly on the part of Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.\n\nDuring the strike, Boston experienced several nights of lawlessness. Several thousand members of the Massachusetts State Guard, supported by volunteers, restored order by force. Press reaction both locally and nationally described the strike as Bolshevik-inspired and directed at the destruction of civil society. The strikers were called \"deserters\" and \"agents of Lenin.\" Samuel Gompers of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging the cause of labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. \n\nNine were killed in several days of civil unrest and the threat of a general strike. Eight of the nine were fatally shot by members of the State Guard. The police strike ended on September 13, when Commissioner Curtis announced the replacement of all striking workers with 1,500 new officers, given higher wages. The strike proved a setback for labor unions. The AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.\n\nIn 1895, the Massachusetts legislature transferred control of the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board and gave the governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical working conditions of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and the hiring, training, and discipline of the police officers.\n\nIn 1918, the salary for patrolmen was set at $1,400 a year ($ in 2020). Police officers had to buy their own uniforms and equipment which cost over $200. New recruits received $730 during their first year, which increased annually to $821.25 and $1000, and to $1,400 after six years. In the years following World War I, inflation dramatically eroded the value of a police officer's salary. From 1913 to May 1919, the cost of living rose by 76%, while police wages rose just 18%. Discontent and restiveness among the Boston police force grew as they compared their wages and found they were earning less than an unskilled steelworker, half as much as a carpenter or mechanic and 50 cents a day less than a streetcar conductor. Boston city laborers were earning a third more on an hourly basis.\n\nPolice officers had an extensive list of grievances. They worked ten-hour shifts and typically recorded weekly totals between 75 and 90 hours. They were not paid for time spent on court appearances. They also objected to being required to perform such tasks as \"delivering unpaid tax bills, surveying rooming houses, taking the census, or watching the polls at election\" and checking the backgrounds of prospective jurors as well as serving as \"errand boys\" for their officers. They complained about having to share beds and the lack of sanitation, baths, and toilets at many of the 19 station houses where they were required to live, most of which dated to before the Civil War. The Court Street station had four toilets for 135 men, and one bathtub.\n\nBoston's police officers, acting with the sponsorship of the police department, had formed an association known as the Boston Social Club in 1906. In 1917, a committee of police officers representing the Social Club met with Commissioner Stephen O'Meara to ask about a raise. He was sympathetic, but advised them to wait for a better time. They pressed the issue in the summer of 1918 and, near the end of the year, Mayor Andrew Peters offered salary increases that would affect about one-fourth of the officers. O'Meara died in December 1918, and Governor Samuel McCall appointed Edwin Upton Curtis, former Mayor of Boston, as Commissioner of the Boston Police Department. After another meeting where representatives of the Social Club repeated their salary demands, Peters said: \"while the word 'strike' was not mentioned, the whole situation is far more serious than I realized.\" He also made it clear to the rank and file that they were not entitled to form their own union. Curtis did not share his predecessor's or the mayor's sympathy for the police, but in February 1918 he offered a wage compromise that the police rejected. In May, Governor Coolidge announced raises, which were also rejected. When the Social Club's representatives tried to raise grievances with him, Curtis set up his own grievance committee to handle management-employee disputes, based on the election of representatives from each precinct house by secret ballot, and it met just once.\n\nA few months later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), responding to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some city officials, who opposed the unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.\n\nThe Boston police decided to organize under an AFL charter in order to gain support from other unions in their negotiations and any strike that might ensue. On August 9, 1919, the Boston Social Club requested a charter from the AFL. On August 11, Curtis issued a General Order forbidding police officers to join any \"organization, club or body outside the department\", making an exception only for patriotic organizations such as the newly-formed American Legion. His administration argued that such a rule was based on the conflict of interest between police officers' duties and union membership:\n\nOn August 15, the police received their AFL charter. On August 17, the Central Labor Union of Boston welcomed the police union and denounced Curtis for his assertions that the police had no right to unionize. Curtis refused to meet with the eight members of the police union's committee. He suspended them and 11 others who held various union offices and scheduled trials to determine if they had violated his General Order. At this point, Curtis was a hero to business interests. Late in August, the New Hampshire Association of Manufacturers called him \"the Ole Hanson of the east,\" equating the events they anticipated in Boston with the earlier Seattle General Strike.\n\nMayor Peters sought to play an intermediary role by appointing a Citizen's Committee to review the dispute about union representation. He chose a well-known local reformer as its chair, James J. Storrow. Storrow's group recommended that Curtis and the police agree to a police union without AFL ties and without the right to strike. Curtis in turn would recognize the police union and the union would agree to remain \"independent and unaffiliated\". Storrow's group also recommended that no action be taken against the 19 men whom Curtis had suspended. Four of Boston's five newspapers backed the compromise, with only the \"Boston Transcript\" holding to a consistent anti-union position. The Boston Chamber of Commerce backed it as well.\n\nCurtis, with the backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, rejected the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.\n\nIn anticipation of the strike, all of Boston's newspapers called it \"Bolshevistic,\" pleaded with the police to reconsider and predicted dire consequences. One also warned the police that their eventual defeat was guaranteed, that they would lose because \"behind Boston in this skirmish with Bolshevism stands Massachusetts, and behind Massachusetts stands America.\"\n\nOn September 9, Boston Police Department officers went on strike at 5:45 p.m. Of the force's 1,544 officers and men, 1,117 (72%) failed to report for work. Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. Many of the strikebreakers were students at Harvard University.\n\nOver the night of September 9–10, the city witnessed an outbreak of hooliganism and looting. Some was rowdy behavior that scared respectable citizens, such as youths throwing rocks at streetcars and overturning the carts of street vendors. More overtly criminal activity included the smashing of store windows and looting their displays or setting off false fire alarms. Such activity was restricted to certain parts of the city and, according to the \"New York Times\", \"throughout the greater part of the city the usual peace and quiet prevailed.\" In the morning the mayor asked the governor to furnish a force of State Guards; Coolidge promptly agreed and eventually provided almost 5,000 men under the command of Brig. Gen. Samuel D. Parker. Commissioner Curtis later praised the State Guards' performance in his \"Annual Report\": \"The whole community is now aware of the effectiveness with which the Massachusetts State Guard worked when it came into the city. I cannot add anything to the universal chorus of commendation that has greeted their work.\" The morning papers following the first night's violence were full of loud complaints and derogatory terms for the police: \"deserters\", \"agents of Lenin.\"\n\nViolence peaked the next evening, the night of September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to discourage thieves taking advantage of the strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. \n\nThe death total ultimately reached nine. In the \"cavalry charge\" of State Guard troops in Scollay Square on the 10th, Robert Lallie was shot and killed; Miss Margaret Walsh was wounded and died the next day. Henry Groat (or Grote), age 20, was killed near the Armory near Jamaica Plain for refusing to abandon a game of craps. On the 11th a striking policeman, a nine-year veteran named Richard D. Reemts, disarmed two strikebreaking policemen at Columbus Avenue and Buckingham Street then was fatally shot by an auto parts dealer. Passerby Arthur E. (or E.B.) McGill was shot to death in Howard Street. Three other men, Raymond L. Barnen (reported elsewhere as Bayers or Barros), Robert Sheehan, and Anthony Carr, were also killed on the 11th. The final fatal casualty may have been 25-year-old Gustave Geist on the 13th. All but Reemts were shot by members of the state militia. \n\nCity life continued relatively normally, especially during daytime hours. Schools remained open. Later claims against the city for losses incurred during the two nights of disorder ran to $35,000, of which the city paid $34,000. Those figures represent a non-partisan calculation of the costs of the strike to the Boston business community.\n\nWhen Governor Coolidge called the strikers \"deserters\" and \"traitors,\" a mass meeting of the Boston Police Union responded:\n\nOn the evening of September 11, the Central Labor Union met to consider calling a general strike in support of the striking police. Earlier it had expressed enthusiasm for a general strike, more likely as an expression of solidarity than a declaration of serious intent. It collected the votes of its constituent unions and on September 12 announced it was delaying a decision. Their statement explained their reasoning: \"We are not to act in a manner that will give the prejudiced press and autocratic employers a chance to criticize us.\"\n\nOn September 11, Matthew Woll, an AFL vice-president, said his organization discouraged strikes by government employees but defended their right to organize: \"all wage earners have the right to associate with one another and collectively to improve their condition\". He blamed the strike on government managers who failed to recognize that right and put the Boston situation in the context of the broader union movement: \"On the question of industrial democracy [i.e., unionization], we find still that group of employers, Bourbonic in character, who believe democracy means for them to ruin or rule industrially. They cannot conceive that the workers have any right in the management of industry. ... The time has passed when any man can say he is the ruler of the people in his employment.\" AFL President Samuel Gompers, just returned from Europe, quickly assessed the situation and the strength of public sentiment. On September 12, he urged the strikers to return to work, asking the city to agree to suspend judgment on whether to recognize the police union. In a telegram to Mayor Peters he cited the model of Washington, D.C., which had, at the suggestion of President Wilson, suspended its regulation forbidding police officers to join a union affiliated with the AFL until a conference scheduled for October 6. The police accepted Gompers' recommendation immediately. Coolidge replied with a statement of support for Curtis' hard line. Gompers telegraphed Coolidge again, this time blaming Curtis for the crisis. Coolidge dismissed the Commissioner's behavior as irrelevant, because no provocation could justify the police walkout. His terse summation created his reputation on the national scene: \"There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime.\" Coolidge said he would continue to \"defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts.\"\n\nBy the weekend, the presence of the State Guards had become a curiosity. Larger than usual crowds strolled in the center of the city. Thousands attended a band concert on the Boston Common. \"The shootings of the last few days for interference with guardsmen,\" said the \"New York Times\", \"seem to have had a marked effect.\"\n\nCoolidge said he originally hoped to reinstate the officers, stating in a telegram to a labor convention, \"I earnestly hope that circumstances may arise which will cause the police officers to be reinstated\". Over the objections of Mayor Peters, Commissioner Curtis announced on September 13 that he planned to recruit a new force. He fired roughly 1,100 and hired 1,574 replacement police officers from a pool of unemployed World War I veterans. Members of the United Garment Workers refused to sew uniforms for the new hires, who had to report for work in civilian clothing.\n\nThe new officers hired in the wake of the strike received higher salaries and more vacation days than the strikers had. They enjoyed a starting salary of $1,400 along with a pension plan, and the department covered the cost of their uniforms and equipment. The population of Boston raised $472,000 to help pay for the State Guards until new police officers could be recruited.\n\nThe State Guard was relieved from duty on December 21, 1919 after the Boston Police Department had recruited enough new members to begin policing the city again.\n\nIn an editorial on the first morning of the strike, the \"New York Times\" supported the police commissioner and said that the strikers were \"[i]nspired unconsciously by anti-social ideals, or acting by 'suggestion' of their London and Liverpool brethren\", which had recently seen similar strikes. It said:\n\nIt later called the strike \"this Boston essay in Bolshevism\" and lamented the attempt of Mayor Peters and the Storrow Commission \"to submit to compromise an issue that could not be compromised\". Newspaper accounts exaggerated the level of crime and violence that accompanied the strike, resulting in a national furor that shaped the political response. A Philadelphia paper viewed the Boston violence in the same light as other labor unrest and numerous race riots in 1919: \"Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance.\" President Woodrow Wilson, speaking from Montana, branded the walkout \"a crime against civilization\" that left the city \"at the mercy of an army of thugs.\" He said that \"the obligation of a policeman is as sacred and direct as the obligation of a soldier. He is a public servant, not a private employee, and the whole honor of the community is in his hands. He has no right to prefer any private advantage to the public safety.\" Elihu Root, a former Secretary of War and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, told a Carnegie Hall audience on September 17 that the strike was an attack on constitutional government because it represented \"the passing of power to enforce laws, the power to punish crime, the power to maintain order from the whole people of the United States\" to the 3% of the population represented by the AFL.\n\nA report from Washington, D.C. included this headline: \"Senators Think Effort to Sovietize the Government Is Started.\" Senator Henry Cabot Lodge saw in the strike the dangers of the national labor movement: \"If the American Federation of Labor succeeds in getting hold of the police in Boston it will go all over the country, and we shall be in measurable distance of Soviet government by labor unions.\" The \"Ohio State Journal\" opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: \"When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well. He has committed the unpardonable sin; he has forfeited all his rights.\"\n\nIn the police commissioner's \"Annual Report\" for 1919, Curtis presented his view of the strike. He argued that he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night because the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By the end of the year the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.\n\nThe strike gave momentum to Coolidge's political career, and a nationwide reputation for decisive action that was not in keeping with his tendency toward deliberation. In 1918, he had narrowly been elected governor. In 1919 he won 62% of the votes when running against an opponent who favored reinstating the strikers. He failed to carry Boston by just 5,000 votes, an impressive showing for a Republican in a strongly Democratic city. The \"Boston Transcript\" reported:\n\nCoolidge himself later said, \"No doubt it was the police strike in Boston that brought me into national prominence.\" In a post-election congratulatory telegram President Wilson wrote: \"I congratulate you upon your election as a victory for law and order. When that is the issue, all Americans must stand together.\" His role in the strike, however limited, became a prominent feature of his resume as he sought higher office. According to one obituary, \"the Boston police strike of 1919 ... brought him national prominence and the nomination for the Vice Presidency\" in 1920. When he succeeded to the presidency in 1923 upon the death of Warren Harding, the \"New York Times\" headlined its biography: \"Coolidge Firmness Won Recognition; His Suppression of the Boston Police Strike Made Him a National Figure\". Coolidge's political rivals interpreted his role differently. In 1925, U.S. Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin said that Coolidge's failure to intervene in that year's coal strike mirrored his 1919 actions when he \"persistently refused to act upon the requests of the Mayor of Boston for assistance until riot and bloodshed had aroused the entire State. Then when order had been restored by the efforts of Mayor Peters and the Storrow committee Coolidge sent in the militia and claimed full credit for restoring 'law and order'.\"\n\nThe strike heightened public fear of labor unrest and the possible radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes in the years following World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to unionize until World War II.\n\nIn 1930, a history of the \"Boston Transcript\", the most resolutely anti-union of Boston's newspapers in 1919, perpetuated its original account of urban chaos during the strike's first nights. It described large crowds, including a number of sailors from docked naval ships, that took to the streets, smashing windows, committing robbery and stoning bystanders and cars. It said that the northern, southern, and western areas of the city were all taken over by armed gangs.\n\nLegislation passed by the Massachusetts legislature in 1933 made it easier for police officers who had been off the force for more than a year to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.\n\nThe Boston Police Patrolman's Association was formed in 1965 following the enactment of a state statute allowing state and municipal workers to organize for the sake of collective bargaining.\n\nNo police officers in the U.S. went out on strike until July 1974, when some Baltimore police, estimated at 15% to 50% of the force, refused to report for work for several days as a demonstration of support for other striking municipal unions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1977402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977402", "title": "Abram Hoffer", "text": "Abram Hoffer\n\nAbram Hoffer (November 11, 1917 – May 27, 2009) was a Canadian biochemist, physician, and psychiatrist known for his \"adrenochrome hypothesis\" of schizoaffective disorders. According to Hoffer, megavitamin therapy and other nutritional interventions are potentially effective treatments for schizophrenia and other diseases. Hoffer was also involved in studies of LSD as an experimental therapy for alcoholism and the discovery that high-dose niacin can be used to treat high cholesterol and other dyslipidemias. Hoffer's ideas about megavitamin therapy to treat mental illness are not accepted by the medical community.\n\nHoffer was born in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1917, the last of four children and the son of Israel Hoffer. Originally interested in agriculture, Hoffer earned both a Bachelor of Science and a master's degree in agricultural chemistry from University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. He then took up a scholarship for a year of post-graduate work with the University of Minnesota, followed by work developing assays for niacin levels at a wheat products laboratory in Winnipeg. Hoffer earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1944, part of which involved the study of vitamins (particularly B vitamins and their effect on the body) and with an interest in nutrition went on to study medicine at the University of Manitoba in 1945. After two years of clinical work at the University of Toronto, Hoffer earned his MD in 1949. Though originally intending to be a general practitioner, during his degree Hoffer developed an interest in psychiatry. He married Rose Miller in 1942, and his son Bill Hoffer was born in 1944 followed by two more children, John and Miriam, in 1947 and 1949.\n\nHoffer was hired by the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health in 1950 to establish a provincial research program in psychiatry, and joined the Regina Psychiatric Services Branch, Department of Public Health in 1951. He remained the Director of Psychiatric Research until entering private practice in 1967. Critical of psychiatry for its emphasis on psychosomatic psychoanalysis and for what he considered a lack of adequate definition and measurement, Hoffer felt that biochemistry and human physiology may be used instead. He hypothesised that schizophrenics may lack the ability to remove the hallucinogenic catecholamine metabolite adrenochrome from their brains. Hoffer thought niacin could be used as a methyl acceptor to prevent the conversion of noradrenaline into adrenaline and that Vitamin C could be used to prevent the oxidation of Adrenaline to Adrenochrome. Hoffer called his theory the \"adrenochrome hypothesis\".\n\nIn 1967, Hoffer resigned some of his academic and administrative positions, entered into private psychiatric practice in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and created the \"Journal of Schizophrenia\" (renamed the \"Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\" in 1986). Hoffer used the journal to publish articles on what he called \"nutritional psychiatry\", later orthomolecular psychiatry, claiming his ideas were consistently rejected by mainstream journals because they were unacceptable to the medical establishment. In 1976, Hoffer relocated to Victoria, British Columbia and continued with his private psychiatric practice until his retirement in 2005. In 1994 Hoffer founded the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine, holding its inaugural in Vancouver in April of the same year. Hoffer continued to provide nutritional consultations and served as editor of the \"Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\". He was also President of the Orthomolecular Vitamin Information Centre in Victoria, BC.\n\nHoffer died at the age of 91 on May 27, 2009 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. His remains were buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Victoria.\n\nWorking in Saskatchewan with Humphry Osmond (who coined the term \"psychedelic\"), Hoffer and other scientists sought to find medicinal uses for hallucinogenic drugs. Part of the research involved Hoffer, Osmond and their wives consuming LSD in an effort to become better acquainted with, and better understand its effects, later joined by other experimenters and their wives. Their work began attracting notoriety within professional, provincial and federal and political circles, and they were courted by the emerging movement to restrict peyote as well as Native American groups that used the substance in religious ceremonies. Hoffer, Osmond and others treated alcoholics with LSD. Canadian scientists reported a fifty percent success rate in one study, although Hoffer speculated that it was more likely the psychedelic experience of LSD, rather than simulated \"delirium tremens\", that convinced the alcoholics to stop drinking.\n\nWhile working at the Regina General Hospital in the 1950s, Hoffer and James Stephen examined the effects of large doses of niacin on various diseases, including schizophrenia; Hoffer theorized that adrenalin, when oxidized to adrenochrome was an endogenous neurotoxin that could cause schizophrenia. At the same time, another Canadian working in Saskatoon, pathologist Rudolf Altschul, was exploring the use of high doses of niacin to lower cholesterol in rabbits and patients with degenerative vascular disease. The three combined their work, and in 1955 produced a paper entitled \"Influence of nicotinic acid on serum cholesterol in man.\" The paper summarized their research showing high-dose niacin significantly lowered cholesterol in both high cholesterol patients as well as low cholesterol control subjects. The results were replicated by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and in Germany the following year. High-dose niacin has since become a treatment option for individuals with high blood cholesterol and related blood lipid abnormalities.\n\nAt such high doses niacin acts like a drug rather than a vitamin and may have side effects of intense flushing of the face and torso and, rarely, liver toxicity. Hoffer continued to promote niacin as a treatment for schizophrenia, though this approach was not accepted by mainstream medicine. Subsequent research suggested that Hoffer's adrenochrome theory had merit as people with schizophrenia have defects in the genes that produce glutathione S-transferase, which eliminates the byproducts of catecholamines from the brain. Though Hoffer and Osmond reported nicotinic acid could help with the treatment of schizophrenia, these results could not be replicated by others. Despite the apparent face validity of Hoffer's \"transmethylation hypothesis\" (in which it was thought that the production of catecholamines could sometimes go awry and produce a hallucinogenic neurotoxin), it was ultimately rejected for two reasons: the alleged neurotoxins were never identified and the cause of schizophrenia became attributed to dysfunctions in neurotransmitters.\n\nHoffer's claims regarding schizophrenia and his theories of orthomolecular medicine have been criticized. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reported methodological flaws in Hoffer's work on niacin as a schizophrenia treatment and referred to follow-up studies that did not confirm any benefits of the treatment,\nprompting at least two responses.\nMultiple additional studies in the United States, Canada, and Australia similarly failed to find benefits of megavitamin therapy to treat schizophrenia. The term \"orthomolecular medicine\" was labeled a misnomer as early as 1973. Psychiatrist and critic of psychiatry Thomas Szasz, author of \"The Myth of Mental Illness\" (1961), believed Hoffer's view of schizophrenia as a physical disease treatable with vitamins and self-help therapy to be \"pure quackery\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977405", "title": "2005 NBA Finals", "text": "2005 NBA Finals\n\nThe 2005 NBA Finals was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2004–05 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs played the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons for the title, with the Spurs holding home court advantage and the Pistons as defending champions. The series was played under a best-of-seven format. (Unlike the previous three rounds, the team with home court advantage hosted games one, two, six, and seven if all were necessary). It also marked the Pistons' first NBA Finals loss since 1988.\n\nThe Spurs won the series four games to three in the first NBA Finals to go to a Game 7 since 1994. The games were broadcast on ABC, with Al Michaels and Hubie Brown commentating. National radio coverage was provided by ESPN Radio through announcers Jim Durham and Dr. Jack Ramsay.\n\nThis series was not only the first matchup of the previous two NBA champions since the 1987 Finals (Lakers d. Celtics, 4-2), it was a match up of the two premier defensive teams of that era: from the 2002–03 season to the 2004–05 season, the Spurs and Pistons routinely finished in the top three in Points Allowed: in 2003, Detroit was #1 and San Antonio #3; in 2004, the teams finished in a tie for the #1 spot; in 2005, the Spurs were #1 and the Pistons were #2. The Spurs were considered more capable of playing at a faster pace, as evidenced by their convincing win against the high-scoring Phoenix Suns during the Western Conference Finals. However, both teams performed exceptionally well when scoring over 100 points (Detroit was 22-3, San Antonio was 28-2).\n\nGoing into the 2005 Finals, the Spurs had won two championships (1999 and 2003), while Detroit had three (1989, 1990, and 2004). The 2004 Championship was considered a major upset by some sportswriters because of the Lakers' big name talent. Others saw the result as fully legitimate, pointing out that Detroit's defense outplayed the Lakers' offense. Further, the balanced Detroit offense proved especially difficult to deal with when Karl Malone's injured knee left the Lakers without a reliable presence to slow down the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace. Many thought that a contributing factor to the Lakers' loss was the well-publicized tension between superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.\n\nBoth the Spurs and the Pistons were ranked number two in their respective conferences, with the Phoenix Suns ranked number one in the West and the Miami Heat ranked number one in the East.\n\nSportswriters all across the country generally considered this one of the few \"too-close-to-call\" series to occur. Most picked the series to go to six or seven games.\n\nThe Spurs breezed through the playoffs with relative ease, compared to the Pistons. They defeated the Nuggets 4-1 to open the playoffs, winning four straight after losing the home opener. They then defeated the SuperSonics within six games the following series. Phoenix was expected by many to put up a challenge, but the Spurs won the series easily, four games to one.\n\nThe Pistons had a slightly tougher road back to the Finals. The opening round was a fairly easy five-game victory over Philadelphia. Next, the Pistons faced the Indiana Pacers, one of the NBA's most resilient teams. Indiana was expected by most experts to falter and miss the playoffs after the Pacers–Pistons brawl; however, led by retiring Pacers legend Reggie Miller, the Pacers still made the playoffs and unexpectedly won their first-round series against the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The Pacers mounted a formidable challenge but after a Game Six loss, Reggie Miller's storied 19-year career was over. With the series ending in Indianapolis, Miller was treated to a prolonged standing ovation from the Conseco Fieldhouse crowd. Detroit's next opponent was the East #1 seed Miami, led by superstars Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal. After winning Game One, the Pistons fell behind 2-1 after three games and 3-2 after five games. By winning Game Six on their home court, the Pistons forced a Game Seven. In Game Seven, Detroit overcame the odds to beat the Heat at American Airlines Arena, and thus advanced to the NBA Finals for the second straight year.\n\nBoth teams split the two meetings, each won by the home team:\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals to have the sticker version of the Larry O'Brien Trophy adorn the center court (team logo still visible in the middle), with the NBA Finals wordmark logo on opposite ends of the court. This remained in effect until the 2009 NBA Finals; the position of the O'Brien trophy was modified for the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nManu Ginóbili was the star of Game One, turning in a virtuoso performance in the fourth quarter to lead the Spurs to victory. Ginobili scored 15 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to complement a huge game by Tim Duncan (24 points, 17 rebounds).\n\nGinobili, who in the previous summer led Argentina in points and assists en route to Olympic gold, took over in the final period. He scored eight points in a decisive 12–2 surge that gave the Spurs a 67–55 lead, then throttled a push by the Pistons with a swooping dunk, 3-pointer and running hook for an 81–67 advantage with less than two minutes to go.\n\nHaving been idle for a week, the Spurs opened the game in lackluster fashion – in the first eight minutes the Spurs trailed 19–7 – but were able to fight back and stabilize the game. It may have happened that Detroit's more recent play led to fourth quarter fatigue which enabled the Spurs' strong fourth quarter; in any case, the Spurs prevailed in the first contest.\n\nThe resilient Detroit Pistons were expected to play a stronger Game Two in response to their fourth-quarter letdown in Game One. Exactly the opposite occurred. From the opening tip, Game Two was all San Antonio as the Spurs got out to a quick lead and never looked back.\n\nThe Spurs took advantage of Detroit's uncharacteristic mistakes throughout the night, which included missing nine shots from inside four feet from the basket. While the Pistons went cold (0-6) from behind the three-point line, the Spurs made 11 3-pointers, including four each by Manu Ginóbili and Bruce Bowen, who did not score a point in Game One. Ginobili again led the Spurs with a 27 points, while Tim Duncan finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Antonio McDyess was the high scorer for Detroit, scoring 15 points off the bench.\n\nThe 2-0 lead was a big advantage for San Antonio. In the history of the NBA, the team with home-court advantage started a series with a 2–0 lead 153 times. On just seven occasions, the trailing team rebounded to win the series.\n\nIn NBA history, only two teams had ever won a Finals series after facing a 2–0 deficit — the Boston Celtics in the 1969 NBA Finals and the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1977 NBA Finals — however, just one year later the Miami Heat would accomplish this feat against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals.\n\nWith that task looming ahead, the Pistons responded in tremendous fashion. Chauncey Billups and Richard Hamilton combined for 44 points, while Ben Wallace (15 pts, 11 reb, 5 blk, 3 stl) together with Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess harassed Tim Duncan into a 5–15 shooting night. The Pistons dominated the second half, winning quarters three and four by the score of 55–37.\n\nThe Pistons became the first team to score more than 90 points in a Finals game against the Spurs during this game.\n\nThe pattern of the first two games held up in games three and four: home team wins big in the first one and even bigger in the second. And Game Four was the most lopsided of all during the 2005 NBA Finals.\n\nSeven Pistons scored in double figures, with especially efficient bench performances by Lindsey Hunter and Antonio McDyess. In 22 minutes, Hunter scored 17 points and dished out 5 assists; McDyess scored 13 and grabbed 7 rebounds in just 19 minutes.\n\nConversely, only three Spurs scored in double figures (Ginobili, Duncan, Parker), and among all Spurs attempting five or more field goals, only Tony Parker (6-13, 46.2% shooting) managed to surpass the 45% mark. Collectively, the Spurs shot 37% and committed 17 turnovers to the Pistons' NBA Finals-record four.\n\nHunter's and Billups' 17 points were the fewest to lead an NBA Finals game since George Yardley of the Fort Wayne Pistons led all scorers with 16 points in the fifth game of the 1955 NBA Finals.\n\nWith the first four games of the 2005 Finals being blowouts by the home team, Game Five was the close game everyone was waiting for, and it went down as one of the more memorable games in Finals history.\n\nThe game was closely contested by throughout the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation was not enough to settle this game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead in the first few minutes of overtime, and seemed to have the game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95-93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with a chance. On the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished it right back to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.\n\nHorry went 5 for 6 from beyond the arc, including the game-winner, and scored 21 points coming off the bench. He hadn't scored a point until the final play of the 3rd quarter. He carried the team in the fourth quarter and overtime as his teammates struggled with the weight of a must-win game on the road against an accomplished adversary. In addition to the game-winning three-pointer, late in overtime Horry made a spectacular left-handed dunk while being fouled as the shot clock wound down.\n\nTim Duncan, despite struggling from the free-throw line, finished with 26 points and 19 rebounds for the Spurs. Chauncey Billups was the high scorer for the Pistons, finishing with a game-high 34 points in the losing effort.\n\nGame 6 was a close game all along, and the lead kept fluctuating between the two teams. Again, the leading stars on both teams played big games. Detroit pulled away early in the fourth for an 80–73 lead with five minutes to go, but the Spurs continued to threaten them. Soon, it was back to a one-point game.\n\nThen, Rasheed Wallace planted a three-pointer to pull away, and even with a resilient game by the Spurs, the Pistons had clinched the victory.\n\nNevertheless, several Pistons free throws were necessary in the final moments of the game to put a win out of reach for the Spurs.\n\nRasheed Wallace had a big game to atone for the mistake he made for leaving Horry open in Game 5. Despite his mistake, Wallace was nonchalant about the play, even commenting incorrectly that he left Horry to guard Duncan.\n\nBillups and Prince again led the Pistons with steady, unwavering defense, which is the key, as it is often said, to victory. Although Duncan and Ginobili finished with 21 points each, neither was able to seriously threaten the strong Pistons defense enough to win the game. Detroit thus won its fifth consecutive game facing elimination. The Pistons became the first road team to force a Game 7 in the NBA Finals.\n\nFor the first time in eleven years, the NBA Finals came down to a decisive Game Seven. Momentum was on Detroit's side, but the Spurs had home-court advantage. The Pistons were looking to become the first team to ever win the last two games on the road after being down 3–2. NBA history was heavily in favor of the Spurs, who were looking to celebrate a title at the SBC Center for the second time in three years. NBA teams are 74–17 all-time at home in Game 7, and 9-0 when leading 3–2 going home.\n\nEntering this game, the Pistons tied the 1994 New York Knicks for most games played in a single postseason, with 25. The Boston Celtics broke this record during their championship season of 2008.\n\nLike the previous two games of the series, Game Seven was closely contested throughout, but the Spurs fell into a nine-point deficit with 7:45 left in the third quarter. Though Tim Duncan was for much of the series unable to shoot for a high percentage against Detroit's front line, he led the Spurs out of that nine-point hole. In the final 7:45 of the third quarter, Duncan scored 10 of the teams' 18 final third quarter points and the game was tied to start the fourth. Behind clutch plays from Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili, the Spurs took control of the fourth quarter to earn an 81–74 victory, clinching the franchise's third Larry O'Brien Trophy. For the game, Tim Duncan finished with a game high 25 points and 11 rebounds, while teammate Manu Ginóbili pitched in with 23 points. Richard Hamilton, with 15 points, was the high scorer for the Pistons, who fell just short of winning back-to-back championships.\n\nTim Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award. Manu Ginóbili, Tony Parker, and Bruce Bowen each received their second championship ring, while Robert Horry became only the second player in NBA history (John Salley being the first) to play on championship teams for three different franchises. Sean Marks became the first New Zealander to win a championship ring.\n\n| align=\"left\" | || 7 || 0 || 20.6 || .407 || .375 || .800 || 2.1 || 1.6 || 0.6 || 0.3 || 4.6\n| align=\"left\" | || 5 || 0 || 6.0 || .500 || .000 || .500 || 0.2 || 0.6 || 0.2 || 0.0 || 2.2\nThe games were broadcast exclusively on ABC in the US. The featured song, aired throughout the playoffs, was Rob Thomas' \"This Is How A Heart Breaks.\" Game 3 had a Nielsen rating percentage of only 7.2% of households and cumulating to a 7.1 average for the first three games, 32% lower than the average of the first three 2004 NBA Finals games. While all seven games were the top-rated shows of their nights, the average viewership of the 2005 Finals (11.5 million viewers, 7.6 rating/14 share) decreased from the average of the 2004 Finals (17.9 million, 11.5/20). The 2003 Finals averaged 9.8 million viewers and 6.5/12.\n\nThe Spurs won a franchise-record 63 victories to clinch the top seed in the West in the 2005–06 NBA season. However, for the third time they were unable to win consecutive championships, bowing to their Texas rivals, the Dallas Mavericks, in Game Seven of the Conference Semifinals. The Mavs would go on to lose in the 2006 NBA Finals. The Spurs did win the 2007 NBA Finals (the Mavericks with 67-15 record, were eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in the first round) the following year, their fourth as a franchise, and won again in 2014.\n\n, this was the Pistons last appearance in the NBA Finals. Head coach Larry Brown sought and succeeded in buying out his contract as head coach after the season. He eventually ended up coaching for his hometown New York Knicks, but would only win 23 games in the 2006 season. Brown eventually left after the season, and two years later Brown resurfaced, this time coaching the Charlotte Bobcats, where he would lead them to the playoffs in his second year.\n\nThe Pistons, guided by new coach Flip Saunders, won a franchise-record 64 wins and seemed primed to regain the NBA title. However, Detroit fell in six games to the Miami Heat, who would go on and win the 2006 NBA title. Franchise centerpiece Ben Wallace abruptly left for the Chicago Bulls, yet the Pistons still made the Conference Finals the next two seasons, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics, respectively. Finally, the remaining core of the team was dismantled at the start of the 2008-09 NBA season.\n"}
{"id": "1977416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977416", "title": "Nile monitor", "text": "Nile monitor\n\nThe Nile monitor (\"Varanus niloticus\") is a large member of the monitor family (Varanidae) found throughout most of Sub-Saharan Africa and along the Nile. The population of West Africa forests and savannahs is sometimes recognized as a separate species, the West African Nile monitor (\"V. stellatus\"). Other common names include the African small-grain lizard, water leguaan or river leguaan (leguan, leguaan, and likkewaan mean monitor lizard in South African English, and can be used interchangeably).\n\nMembers of the Nile monitor species group were already well known to Africans in ancient times. For example, they were commonly caught, likely as food, in the Djenné-Djenno culture at least a millennium ago.\n\nThe Nile monitor twice received a scientific name by Carl Linnaeus: First as \"Lacerta monitor\" in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, the starting point of zoological nomenclature. He described it again in 1766 as \"Lacerta nilotica\". Despite being older, the name proposed in 1758 is invalid because it was rejected in ICZN opinion 540, making the name of 1766 valid. The genus \"Varanus\" was only coined in 1820 by Blasius Merrem. Six years later Leopold Fitzinger moved the Nile monitor into this genus as \"Varanus niloticus\", the currently accepted scientific name for the species.\n\nAs traditionally defined, the Nile monitor is a species complex.\n\nThe ornate monitor (\"V. ornatus\") and West African Nile monitor (\"V. stellatus\") were described as species in 1802 and 1803 by François Marie Daudin. In 1942, Robert Mertens moved them both into the Nile monitor (\"V. niloticus\"); as synonyms or as a valid subspecies. This was the standard treatment until 1997, when a taxonomic review based on color and morphology indicated that the ornate monitor is distinctive and revalidated it as a separate species from rainforests of West and Central Africa. In 2016, a review based primarily on genetics came to another result. They found that monitors from West African forests and adjacent savannah are distinctive and worthy of recognition as a separate species: the West African Nile monitor (\"V. stellatus\"). It is estimated to have split from the others in the Nile monitor complex about 7.7 million years ago, making it older than the split between humans and chimpanzees. In contrast, those in the Central African rainforests are genetically similar to the Nile monitor. This essentially splits the ornate monitor—as defined in 1997—into two: the western being the West African Nile monitor and the eastern (of Central African rainforests) being moved back into the Nile monitor. As the type locality for the ornate monitor is in the Central African country of Cameroon, the scientific name \"V. ornatus\" becomes a synonym of \"V. niloticus\". Individuals with the \"ornate color pattern\" and individuals with the \"Nile color pattern\" occur in both the West African Nile monitor and the Nile monitor, with the \"ornate\" appearing to be more frequent in densely forested habitats.\n\nWith the West African Nile monitor as a separate species, there are two main clades in the Nile monitor: A widespread clade found throughout much of Southern, Central and East Africa, as well as more locally in coastal West Africa. The other clade includes the monitors of the Sahel (Mali to Ethiopia) and Nile regions. Despite the differences, the Reptile Database maintains both the ornate monitor and West African Nile monitor as synonyms of the Nile monitor, but do note that this broad species definition includes distinctive subpopulations.\n\nNile monitors can grow to about in length, with the largest specimens attaining . In an average-sized specimen, the snout-to-vent length will be around . In body mass, adults have been reported to vary widely, one study claiming only , others state weights ranging from in big monitors. Variations may be due to age or environmental conditions. Exceptionally large specimens may scale as much as , but this species weighs somewhat less on average than the bulkier rock monitor. They have muscular bodies, strong legs, and powerful jaws. Their teeth are sharp and pointed in juvenile animals and become blunt and peg-like in adults. They also possess sharp claws used for climbing, digging, defense, or tearing at their prey. Like all monitors, they have forked tongues, with highly developed olfactory properties. The Nile monitor has quite striking, but variable, skin patterns, as they are greyish-brown above with greenish-yellow barring on the tail and large, greenish-yellow rosette-like spots on their backs with a blackish tiny spot in the middle. Their throats and undersides are an ochre-yellow to a creamy-yellow, often with faint barring.\n\nTheir nostrils are placed high on their snouts, indicating these animals are highly aquatic. They are also excellent climbers and quick runners on land. Nile monitors feed on fish, snails, frogs, crocodile eggs and young, snakes, birds, small mammals, insects, and carrion. They are also the second largest reptile in the Nile river.\n\nNile monitors are native to Sub-Saharan Africa and along the Nile. They are not found in any of the desert regions of Africa (notably Sahara, Kalahari and much of the Horn of Africa), however, as they thrive around rivers. Nile monitors were reported to live in and around the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and wadis of the Judaean Desert in Israel until the late 19th Century, though they are now extinct in the region.\n\nIn Florida, United States, established breeding populations of Nile monitors have been known to exist in different parts of the state since at least 1990. Genetic studies have shown that these introduced animals are part of the subpopulation that originates from West Africa and now often is recognized as its own species, the West African Nile monitor. The vast majority of the established breeding population is in Lee County, particularly in the Cape Coral and surrounding regions, including the nearby barrier islands (Sanibel, Captiva, and North Captiva), Pine Island, Fort Myers, and Punta Rassa. Established populations also exist in adjacent Charlotte County, especially on Gasparilla Island. Areas with a sizeable number of Nile monitor sightings in Florida include Palm Beach County just southwest of West Palm Beach along State Road 80. In July 2008, a Nile monitor was spotted in Homestead, a small city southwest of Miami. Other sightings have been reported near Hollywood, Naranja, and as far south as Key Largo in the Florida Keys. The potential for the established population of Nile monitors in Lee, Charlotte, and other counties in Florida, to negatively impact indigenous crocodilians (American alligator, \"Alligator mississippiensis\", and American crocodile, \"Crocodylus acutus\") is enormous, given that they normally raid crocodile nests, eat eggs, and prey on small crocodiles in Africa. Anecdotal evidence indicates a high rate of disappearance of domestic pets and feral cats in Cape Coral.\n\nNile monitors are often found in the pet trade despite a highly aggressive demeanor and resistance to taming. Juvenile monitors will tail whip as a defensive measure, and as adults they are capable of inflicting moderate to serious wounds from biting and scratching. Nile monitors require a large cage as juveniles quickly grow when fed a varied diet, and large adults often require custom-built quarters.\n\"\"There are few of these lizards less suited to life in captivity than the Nile Monitor. Buffrenil (1992) considered that, when fighting for its life, a Nile Monitor was a more dangerous adversary than a crocodile of a similar size. Their care presents particular problems on account of the lizards' enormous size and lively dispositions. Very few of the people who buy coloured baby Nile Monitors can be aware that, within a couple of years, their purchase will have turned into an enormous, ferocious carnivore, quite capable of breaking the family cat's neck with a single snap and swallowing it whole.\"\"\n"}
{"id": "1977418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977418", "title": "Dynastic order", "text": "Dynastic order\n\nA dynastic order, monarchical order, or house order, is an order under royal patronage, bestowed by the head of a currently or formerly sovereign royal family as legitimate fons honorum. These are often considered part of the cultural patrimony of the royal family. They are orders of chivalry, and orders of merit just as those distributed by sovereign states, but dynastic orders were often founded or maintained to reward service to a monarch, or the monarch's subsequent dynasty. \n\nAn example of this difference is seen between the Royal Victorian Order, in which appointments are made as a personal gift of the sovereign, thus is a dynastic order, and the Order of the British Empire, in which appointments are made by the sovereign on the basis of recommendations by the Prime Minister, and thus a national order.\n\nThe equivalent is called a state order for orders conferred by sovereign states but not bestowed by royal dynasties.\n\nDynastic orders are under the exclusive control of a monarch and are bestowed without the advice of the political leadership (prime minister or cabinet). A recent report by the British government mentioned that there is \"one remaining exercise that has been identified of the Monarch's truly personal, executive prerogative: that is, the conferment of certain honours that remain within her gift (the Orders of Merit, of the Garter, of the Thistle and the Royal Victorian Order).\"\n\nGenerally, dynastic or house Orders are granted by the monarch for whatever reason the monarch may deem appropriate whereas other orders, often called Merit Orders, are granted on the recommendation of government officials to recognize individual accomplishments or services to the nation.\n\nThe term dynastic order is also used for those orders that continue to be bestowed by former monarchs and their descendants after they have been removed from power. For instance, the website of Duarte Pio de Bragança, a pretender to the throne of Portugal using the title Duke of Braganza, asserts that the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa, \"being a Dynastic Order of the House of Bragança and not an Order of State, continued to be conferred by the last King Dom Manuel II, in the exile.\" On the basis of his succession to King Manuel II, Duarte Pio continues to award those orders of the Kingdom of Portugal which were not taken over by the Portuguese Republic.\n\nThe Portuguese Republic views things somewhat differently, regarding all the royal orders as extinct following the 5 October 1910 revolution with some of them revived in republican form in 1918. For official purposes, Portugal simply ignores the orders awarded by the royal pretender, Duarte Pio. Although no one is prosecuted for accepting orders from Dom Duarte, including himself, Portuguese law requires government permission to accept any official award, either from Portugal or foreign powers, and the awards of Dom Duarte simply do not appear anywhere on either list.\n\nA similar situation exists in Italy, where the Republican Government regards the orders of the former kings to have been abolished but the last king's heir continues to award them. The Italian situation differs from that in Portugal in that Italy forbids the public wearing of the former royal orders in Italy. Nevertheless, the last Italian Crown Prince Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia widely distributes the orders that he claims to have inherited from his father. As is the situation in Portugal, the Italian pretender asserts that control of the Savoy dynastic orders exists separate from the Kingdom of Italy so that he retains the right to award the orders, and accompanying privileges, despite his recognition that \"the Italian throne was formally abolished by referendum in 1946 and a republic was instituted in its place.\"\n\nA third situation of mutual co-existence is maintained in Russia, where, since the fall of communism, the orders of Saint Andrew, Saint George, and Saint Catherine have been reinvented as State Orders of Merit of the Russian Federation. However, the Russian Imperial Orders of Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint Catherine, Saint Anna, Saint Vladimir, and Saint Stanislav have continued to be awarded since the revolution by the successive heads of the Imperial House of Romanov Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, and Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna. In addition, Dynastic Orders of Knighthood were revived and new ones created under Grand Duke Kirill (Order of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker), Grand Duke Vladimir (Order of St. Michael the Archangel), and Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna (Order of St. Anastasia). Awards of these honours are allowed to be worn in Russia, and enjoy semi-official recognition by the church and the state; for example, on 14 December 2001 the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation legalized the wearing of the Order of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker in Russia by military persons on active duty.\n\nThere are many dynastic orders of knighthood, which exist primarily in Europe. Today, dynastic orders include those still bestowed by a reigning monarch, those bestowed by a head of a royal house in exile, and those that have become extinct. Although it is sometimes asserted that the heads of former reigning houses retain the right to their dynastic orders but cannot create new ones, that view is challenged by others who believe that the power to create orders remains with a dynasty forever. In a few cases, formerly reigning families are accused of \"fudging\" the issue by claiming to revive long extinct orders or by changing non-dynastic \"state orders\" into dynastic ones. One example of this is the Order of Saint Michael of the Wing which is sometimes described as a revival of a long dormant order last awarded in the eighteenth century but also described as a new order created in 2004. Another example concerns the Royal Order of Francis I of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. One branch of the family (led by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro) claims that the Order of Francis I was attached to the crown not the state, and thus awards it as a dynastic order. The other branch (led by Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria) regards the Order of Francis I as a state order that became extinct when the Borbon-Two Sicilies royal family accepted the abolition of their monarchy and the state's inclusion in the Kingdom of Italy. Finally, there is the example of a Russian pretender Maria Vladimirovna who published a \"decree\" on 20 August 2010 to create the entirely new \"Imperial Order of the Holy Great Martyr Anastasia\".\n\nAlthough some former royal families and their supporters claim that Roman Catholic Church formally recognizes their right to award various orders, the Vatican denies all such assertions. On 16 October 2012, the Vatican Secretary of State renewed its formal announcement that it only recognizes the orders issued by the Pope, namely:\n\n\n\nThe Secretary of State declared \"other orders, whether of recent origin or mediaeval foundation, are not recognised by the Holy See...To avoid any possible doubts, even owing to illicit issuing of documents or the inappropriate use of sacred places, and to prevent the continuation of abuses which may result in harm to people of good faith, the Holy See confirms that it attributes absolutely no value whatsoever to certificates of membership or insignia issued by these groups, and it considers inappropriate the use of churches or chapels for their so-called 'ceremonies of investiture.'\"\n\n\n\n"}

It does not look like most other computers. The case of the MPF II was a slab with a small chiclet keyboard on its lower part.\n\nIn 1983, the Multiprofessor II retailed in the UK for £269.00 including VAT.\n\nOne key feature of the MPF II was its Chinese BASIC, a version of Chinese-localized BASIC based on Applesoft BASIC.\nThere was also a version sold in Europe, Northern America, India, Singapore, and Australia that did not have Chinese localization.\n\nThe MPF II was not totally compatible with the Apple II.\n\nThe MPF II did not have Apple II's text mode. All the text was drawn on the screen by software rather than generated by hardware. It was the only cost-effective way to generate Chinese text on the screen at a time when a hardware-based Chinese character generator could cost hundreds of U.S. dollars.\n\nLike Apple II, MPF II had two graphics buffers. However, the second buffer was at address A000H while with Apple II it was at 4000H. The keyboard input was mapped to a different address than the Apple II making impossible to play Apple's games on the MPF II.\n\nMPF-II keyboard interface was very simple and consisted of an 8-bit output port and an input port that was directly connected to the keyboard matrix. The Apple joystick interface was not there, and instead, the joystick appeared as a keyboard with arrow keys and two other buttons.\n\nThe external slot interface was also not compatible with the Apple II and could not use any standard interface cards including the Disk II controller.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977429", "title": "Wonderlic test", "text": "Wonderlic test\n\nThe Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test (formerly Wonderlic Personnel Test) is a popular assessment used to measure the cognitive ability and problem-solving aptitude of prospective employees for a range of occupations. It is a proprietary assessment created and distributed by Wonderlic. The assessment is available in 12 different languages and is often used in all types of employment hiring from entry level to executive level. It consists of 50 multiple choice questions to be answered in 12 minutes. The test was developed by Eldon F. Wonderlic, while he was a graduate student at Northwestern University. The score is calculated as the number of correct answers given in the allotted time. A score of 20 is intended to indicate average intelligence. \n\nThe most recent version of the test is WonScore, a cloud-based assessment providing a single score to potential employers based on scientific research. The Wonderlic test was based on the Otis Self-Administering Test of Mental Ability with the goal of creating a short form measurement of cognitive ability.\n\nCreated in 1936 by E. F. Wonderlic, the Wonderlic Personnel Test was the first short-form cognitive abilities test. It was developed to measure general cognitive ability in the areas of math, vocabulary, and reasoning. Wonderlic created and distributed it as a graduate student in the psychology department at Northwestern University from his home. Regarding the time allotted to take the test, Eldon F. Wonderlic, in an article released in 1939, stated the following: \"The length of the test was made such that only about two to five per cent of average groups complete the test in the twelve-minute time limit.\"\n\nOriginally designed to aid in employee selection of companies such as AT&T and Oscar Meyer in the 1940s, the Wonderlic Personnel Test has also been used by both the United States Armed Forces and the National Football League for selection purposes. During World War II, the Navy began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for pilot training and navigation. During this time period, 1940–1960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s Tom Landry, coach of the Dallas Cowboys, was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance. It is still used in the annual NFL Combine as a form of pre-draft assessment. In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time. It may be termed as a quick IQ test.\n\nThe Wonderlic test is continually being updated with repeated evaluations of questions. Also, beginning in the 1970s, Wonderlic began to develop other forms of the Wonderlic Personnel some of which include: Wonderlic Perceptual Ability Tests, Wonderlic Scholastic Level Exam, or the Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test.\n\nThe tests are divided into three different sections: cognitive ability, personality, and motivation.\n\nReleased in the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personnel Test measures an individual's capability of solving problems and learning. The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test – Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability. The Wonderlic Personnel Test is a much more comprehensive test.\n\nThe Wonderlic SLE is the scholastic version of the Wonderlic Personnel Test and is commonly administered to nursing school and medical program applicants.\n\nThe Wonderlic Personality tests measure personal characteristics that are widely accepted as being predictive of a candidate's expected job performance. Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.\n\nAdded during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability/neuroticism, and openness to experience. These are essentially the same constructs as the Big Five personality traits, also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\nAveraging 10–15 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate’s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job. The more motivated they are by those responsibilities, the likelier they will succeed in that position.\n\nSimilar to other standardized tests, the Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test presents its questions in an open response. The types of questions that have appeared in the oldest versions of the Wonderlic test include: analogies, analysis of geometric figures, arithmetic, direction following, disarranged sentences, judgment, logic, proverb matching, similarities, and word definitions. However, the questions may take different angles depending upon the ‘intelligence’ of the question setters.\n\nThe Wonderlic test, as a vocational and intelligence test, falls under the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. As a personnel test the Wonderlic is used to gauge an applicant's job potential, educational potential, and training potential. Six forms of this test are made available (A, B, C, D, E, and F) in which Wonderlic suggests that when two of these versions are to be used, the best combinations are A and B or D and F. However, a study conducted by psychologists Kazmier and Browne (1959) shows that neither of these forms can be regarded as directly equivalent. While there is no lack of tests that could be used in place of the Wonderlic, such as the IQ or the Mechanical Aptitude Test, it is a quick and simple vocational test for personnel recruitment and selection. The Wonderlic test has been peer reviewed by the American Psychological Association and has been deemed worthy of field applications to the industrial use of personnel testing. Other sources can be found on the database APA PsycNET.\n\nIn 1956, Weaver and Boneau reported in the \"Journal of Applied Psychology\" that two of the five forms, A and B, that were published at the time were harder than the others which caused scores on those forms to be significantly lower than scores obtained on forms C–F. Concerning these observed differences, Weaver and Boneau state: \"This accords with the history of the development of the test. Forms D, E, and F are made up of items selected from the Otis Higher, while A and B were developed later and include types of items not found in the Otis.\" Those findings, seemingly, invalidate the claim that those forms were equivalent or consistent. E. N. Hay made a similar observation as well. Hay found that form F was significantly easier than Form D. Furthermore, Kazmier found Form B to be the most difficult of the five forms and, thus, recommended that it \"not be regarded as directly equivalent to any of the forms.\" Kazmier also found Forms D and F to be significantly different from each other and recommended that these forms be regarded as inequivalent. In a study of the Wonderlic's test-retest reliability, conducted in 1992, Stuart McKelvie \"concluded that conscious repetition of specific responses did not seriously inflate the estimate of test-retest reliability.\" To put it simply, one's memory of some of the answers does not significantly affect one's score on the Wonderlic.\n\nIn 1982, Carl Dodrill conducted a study in which 57 adults were administered the Wonderlic twice over a five-year period. In the \"Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology\", Dodrill reported that the test-retest reliability for the Wonderlic was .94. According to a 1989 article in \"Psychological Reports\", the Wonderlic scored a r=.87 on the reliability scale compared along with the Pearson test score of r=.21.\n\nIn an article written in \"Psychological Reports\", T. Matthews and Kerry Lassiter report that the Wonderlic test \"was most strongly associated with overall intellectual functioning,\" which is what it is purported to measure. However, Matthews and Lassiter did not find the Wonderlic to be a successful measure of fluid and crystallized intelligence, and they stated that \"the Wonderlic test scores did not clearly show convergent or divergent validity evidence across these two broad domains of cognitive ability.\" In academic testing, the Wonderlic test has shown high correlations with aptitude tests such as the General Aptitude Test Battery.\n\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of New London, Connecticut, alleging violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\", based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by Groton Long Point, and as a seasonal officer for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective...[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\" The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time. Each profession has its own, unique, average; therefore, different professions require different standards. Wonderlic, Inc. claims a minimum score of 10 points suggests a person is literate.\n\nListed are a sample of median scores by profession on the Wonderlic test from 1983. The scores are listed in descending numerical order, and professions with the same score have been alphabetized.\n\nThe Wonderlic test is used in the NFL Scouting Combine. Paul Brown introduced the test to the league in the late 1960s. According to Paul Zimmerman's \"The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football,\" the average score of an NFL player according to position is the following:\nAn average football player usually scores around 20 points. Quarterbacks and offensive linemen usually have higher scores. Most teams want at least 21 for a quarterback.\n\nSome notable players who scored well below the average include:\n\nSome notable players who scored well above the average include:\n\nJohn P. Lopez of \"Sports Illustrated\" proposed a 26–27–60 rule to predict a quarterback's success in the NFL (at least a 26 on the Wonderlic, at least 27 college starts, and at least 60% pass completion) and listed several examples of successes and failures based on the rule. A 2005 study by McDonald Mirabile found that there is no significant correlation between a quarterback's Wonderlic score and a quarterback's passer rating, and no significant correlation between a quarterback's Wonderlic score and a quarterback's salary. Similarly, a 2009 study by Brian D. Lyons, Brian J. Hoffman, and John W. Michel found that Wonderlic scores failed to positively and significantly predict future NFL performance, draft position, or the number of games started for any position. Lyons said that Wonderlic's \"limited return on investment\" for the NFL is contrary to general mental ability being a very strong predictor of job performance for most careers; \"because it's so physically based, the results point to that [GMA] really doesn't matter\". Donovan McNabb, whose score was the lowest of the five quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 1999 NFL Draft, had the longest and most successful career.\n\nThe Lyons study also found that the relationship between Wonderlic test scores and future NFL performance was negative for a few positions, indicating the higher a player scores on the Wonderlic test, the worse the player will perform in the NFL. According to Pat McInally, who was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fifth round of the 1975 NFL Draft, George Young told him that his perfect score caused him to be selected later than he would have otherwise. NFL reporter Matt Verderame reported that New England Patriots offensive lineman Joe Thuney avoided answering Wonderlic questions so he would not score too high. McInally speculated that \"coaches and front-office guys don't like extremes one way or the other, but particularly not on the high side. I think they think guys who are intelligent will challenge authority too much\". Mike Florio of Profootballtalk.com agreed with McInally:\n\nJob performance in the NFL also includes deviance. A 2016 study found that the Wonderlic significantly predicted future arrests—referred to as criminal off-duty deviance—in NFL draftees.\n\nA simplified and condensed version of the Wonderlic test appears in newer editions of the \"Madden NFL\" video game series. The \"Madden\" version of the test is taken in \"Superstar Mode\" portion of the game, to make the game experience more realistic, although, it is now optional. The questions usually consist of basic math and English questions. For example, \"If Adrian Peterson rushes for 125 yards in a game, how many yards will he have at the end of the season if he keeps up with this pace?\". Players have four answers to choose from when taking this version of the test.\n\n"}
