Net guns have a long history of being used to capture wildlife, for research purposes. A net gun is currently also in development for riot control.\n\nNet guns are becoming increasingly popular in both fiction and non-fiction settings, often seen as an \"easy-fix\" weapon for capturing a target without causing serious harm to it.\n\nOne notable example of a net gun is used in the Predator series of films, most notably \"Predator 2\" and \"Alien vs. Predator\". This version is somewhat lethal, as it tightens around the target and cuts them like razor wire. Other examples include the films \"Total Recall\", \"The Running Man\" and \"Escape from L.A.\", in which a net gun is used to capture the protagonist. The net gun used in the latter two references, as well as \"I, Robot\" is a real item. \n\nIn \"Birds in a Truck\", an episode of the Discovery Channel television series \"MythBusters\", Jamie Hyneman constructs a jury-rigged net gun using PVC, an air tank, a fishing net, and some tennis balls in an attempt to capture pigeons. The net gun functioned as planned, but Jamie failed to catch any of the pigeons. Recently, a net gun was seen on the MTV television series, \"Rob and Big\", as a means of non-lethal home protection from unwanted intruders. After one was featured on \"Rob and Big\", internet searches for net guns drastically increased.\n\nThe term has lately been adopted for fantasy weapons used in imaginary or text-based combat. These fantasy weapons work in the same way as real-world net guns: an explosive charge or compressed air propels a weighted net toward a target. The net envelops the target and immobilizes it.\n"}
{"id": "2298706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298706", "title": "Tonal (mythology)", "text": "Tonal (mythology)\n\nTonal is a concept within the study of Mesoamerican religion, myth, folklore and anthropology. It is a belief found in many indigenous Mesoamerican cultures that a person upon being born acquires a close spiritual link to an animal, a link that lasts throughout the lives of both creatures. The person shows signs of whatever the animal's situation to include scratches and bruises if the animals get in fights, or illness if the animal is ill. It is in this way similar to the concept of Totem.\n\nThe word comes from the Nahuatl word \"tonalli\", meaning \"day\" or \"daysign\". In the Aztec belief system the day of a person's birth calculated in the Tonalpohualli would determine the nature of the person – each day was associated with an animal which could have a strong or weak aspect. The person born on the day of for example \"the dog\" would then have the strong or weak aspect of the dog. In Nahuatl the word Tonalli was used to refer both to a day and to the animal related to that day. In Mayan belief the concept of an animal companion of a person was referred to as \"Way\". The modern Mixe people refer to it as \"Ts'ok\" (Lipp 1991). The Jakaltek Maya people of Concepcion Huista, Guatemala call it \"yixomal ispiẍan nax,\" meaning \"soul bearer\".\n\nThe study of tonalism was initiated by noted archaeologist, linguist and ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton who published a treatise called \"Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History\" which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced nagualism in Mexico in 1894. He identified the different beliefs associated with tonalism in some modern Mexican communities such as the Mixe, the Nahuas, the Zapotecs and Mixtecs.\n\n\n"}

McHugh. The novel is made up of several stories loosely intertwined.\n\nThe novel's title derives from the name of the protagonist, a young gay man of mixed Chinese and Puerto Rican ancestry who goes by the name Rafael Zhang in non-Chinese contexts and Zhang Zhongshan in Chinese contexts. His Chinese given name, Zhongshan, is written with the characters with primary meanings \"center\" and \"mountain\"; the Mandarin name for China also begins with the character meaning \"center\" or \"middle\". Thus, \"China Mountain\" is an alternate reading of his Chinese given name. (Zhongshan is also one of the given names used by Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen.)\n\nThe main story involves a man's maturation in a future dominated by China, where the United States has undergone a Communist revolution (the \"Cleansing Winds Campaign\") after a period of economic crisis. His personal evolution is paralleled by four side stories in his narrative, following characters progressing from arrogant outsiders to finding a place in society.\n\nThe backdrop is a 22nd-century in which the Chinese Communist regime dominates the world. The novel is slightly unusual for science fiction in that none of the characters cause any significant change in the world around them; nor does it use any standard science fiction tropes.\n\n\"The New York Times\" said of the book when it first appeared: \"A first novel this good gives every reader a chance to share in the pleasure of discovery; to my mind, Ms. McHugh's achievement recalls the best work of Samuel R. Delany and Kim Stanley Robinson without being in the least derivative.\"\n\nMcHugh's short story \"Protection\" is set in the same future history as \"China Mountain Zhang\", detailing the experiences of a petty criminal in a \"Reform Through Labor\" camp in Kansas under the future Communist system.\n\nThe novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and Nebula Award for Best Novel and won a Lambda Literary Award, the Locus Award for Best First Novel, and the James Tiptree, Jr. Award.\n"}

Areas commonly included under this rubric include Korean history, Korean culture, Korean literature, Korean art, Korean music, Korean language and linguistics, Korean sociology and anthropology, Korean politics, Korean economics, Korean folklore, Korean ethnomusicology and increasingly study of Korean popular culture. It may be compared to other area studies disciplines, such as American studies and Chinese studies. Korean studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including \"East Asian studies\".\n\nThe term Korean studies first began to be used in the 1940s, but did not attain widespread currency until South Korea rose to economic prominence in the 1970s. In 1991, the South Korean government established the Korea Foundation to promote Korean studies around the world.\n\nKorean studies was originally an area of study conceived of and defined by non-Koreans. Korean scholars of Korea tend to see themselves as linguists, sociologists, and historians, but not as \"Koreanists\" unless they have received at least some of their education outside Korea and are academically active (for example publishing and attending conferences)in languages other than Korean (most Korean studies publications are in English but there is also a significant amount of Korean Studies activity in other European languages), or work outside Korean academia. In the mid-2000s, Korean universities pushing for more classes taught in English began to hire foreign-trained Koreanists of Korean and non-Korean origin to teach classes. This was often geared towards foreigners in Korean graduate schools. There are now graduate school programs in Korean Studies (mostly active at the MA level) in most of the major Korean universities. BA programs in Korean Studies have now been opened at two Korean universities. The BA programs are distinctive in that they have few foreign students.\n\n\nWhat exactly Korean Studies is, who is teaching it, who is learning, and what should be taught continues to be debated. \n\nThere has been a small series of works debating Korean Studies published in academic journals. A sort of historical overview by Charles Armstrong titled \"Development and Directions of Korean Studies in the United States\" comes strongly from Armstrong's perspective teaching history at Columbia University, as his work: \"Focusing on the discipline of history, ... traces the emergence of Korean Studies in the 1950s, the evolution of the field and the changing backgrounds of American scholars working on Korea in the 1960s to 1980s, and the rapid growth of Korean Studies since the early 1990s.\" Another historian, Andre Schmid published an early contribution to the debate in 2008, challenging the ways that English academia was pushing or shaping the directions of Korean Studies. Schmid explained, \"In the unequal global cultural arena where English still dominates, the direction of Korean Studies in the United States disproportionately shapes international representations of Korean culture.\" University of Berkeley Sociologist John Lie contributed two pieces to the debate, the more recent of which challenged the Korean Studies, claiming \"senior Koreanists seem rather content with their progress, telling their followers bizarre tales from the field and seeking to reproduce the archaic and mistaken Harvard East Asia paradigm.\" Lie discusses the weaknesses he sees in this paradigm for the remainder of the essay. In 2018 CedarBough T Saeji published an article in Acta Koreana bringing in the perspective of teaching Korean Studies in Korea, focusing on \"1) the struggle to escape the nation-state boundaries implied in the habitual terminology, particularly when teaching in the ROK, where the country is unmarked (“Han’guk”), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is marked (“Pukhan”), and the diaspora is rarely mentioned at all; 2) the implications of the expansion of Korean Studies as a major within the ROK; 3) in-class navigations of Korean national pride, the trap of Korean uniqueness and (self-)orientalization and attitudes toward the West.\" \n\nA-Z order\n\nA-Z order\n\n\n\nThe term Koreanists indicates academic scholars of Korean language, history, culture, society, music, art, literature, film and more. Noted Koreanists are usually adept in Korean, even if they are citizens of foreign countries.\n\nNotable Koreanists in different fields include:\n\n\n\n"}

Cherryh, set in her Alliance-Union universe. The murder of a major Union politician and scientist has deep, long-lasting repercussions. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1989.\n\nThe sequel, \"Regenesis\", was published by DAW Books in January 2009.\n\nFounded in 2201 by a group of dissident scientists and engineers, the Cyteen star system includes the planet Cyteen and Cyteen Inner and Outer Stations. Cyteen declared its independence from Earth in 2300 CE and now serves as the capital of Union. It is located at Lalande 46650 (BD+01 4774).\n\nThe planet's atmosphere is moderately toxic to humans, necessitating enclaves, or semi-encapsulated city-states, which influences Union's political outlook. Cyteen is seen as the antithesis of Earth; the heart of Union is the research facility Reseune, the center of all research and development of human cloning. Cloned \"azi\" provide the additional population Union needs to exist and expand, a policy which Earth and the Alliance, Union's main rival, deplore and refuse to sanction.\n\nAzi are incubated \"in vitro\" in \"womb-tanks\", but citizen (or \"CIT\") babies can also be cloned the same way, for example to replace a dead child. The fundamental difference between azi and regular humans is that they are educated from birth via \"tape\", a computer-controlled combination of conditioning and biofeedback training. This technology is not limited to azi; it is used by normal humans as well, though to a lesser extent and after they have a chance to develop (i.e. usually after the age of six). This results in profound psychological differences; for example, CITs are much more capable of handling new and uncertain situations, while azi are able to concentrate better.\n\nThe overall educational programme of an azi is referred to as his or her \"psychset\". Designing tapes is an extremely complex discipline, since a badly designed psychset can cause azi to become emotionally unstable.\n\nAriane Emory is one of fourteen \"Specials\", Union-certified geniuses. In addition to her research on azi, she runs Reseune (founded by her parents) with the assistance of Giraud and Denys Nye.\n\nEmory is also a member of the Council of Nine, the elected, top-level executive body of Union. Two political factions vie for power in Union: the Centrists and the Expansionists. The latter, led by Emory, seek to enlarge Union through exploration, building new stations and continued cloning. Her political enemies, headed by Mikhail Corain, prefer to focus on the existing stations and planets. The Expansionists have held power since the foundation of Union, a situation fostered by \"rejuv\", which extends lifespans and staves off the effects of old age. Emory herself is 120 years old at the start of the novel – and only just beginning to show signs of aging – and has been the Councillor for Science for five decades.\n\nEmory's former co-worker and now bitter longtime rival, Jordan Warrick, is also a Special. Jordan has created and raised a clone of himself named Justin. Justin has grown up with and is very close to Grant, an experimental azi created by Emory from the slightly modified geneset of another Special. When Justin goes to work for Emory, she threatens to use Grant, who is Reseune property, for research. Using drugs and tape to overcome Justin's remaining resistance, she rapes the inexperienced seventeen-year-old. This trauma causes him to experience periodic debilitating \"tape-flashes\", similar to the flashbacks that PTSD sufferers experience. Justin does his best to hide the sordid matter from his \"father\", but Jordan eventually learns of it. He is furious and confronts Emory.\n\nShe is found dead later that day. Though it could have been accidental, there is strong suspicion that she was murdered by Jordan. He protests his innocence, but agrees to a confession in order to protect both Justin and Grant. Because of his Special status, he has legal immunity and is only exiled to an isolated research facility far from Reseune. It is later revealed that Emory's rejuv was failing and she was already dying of cancer.\n\nEmory's last project had been the cloning of a promising young chemist to see if it was possible to recreate his abilities. An earlier attempt with Estelle Bok, the inventor of the equation that led to faster-than-light travel, had failed miserably. However, Emory believed this was due to the Bok clone growing up in a different social environment than the original. Emory's ultimate goal was to clone herself, with her successor reliving her life as closely as possible, down to her hormone levels and including two longtime bodyguard azi and companions, Florian and Catlin. Emory also created a sophisticated and powerful computer program to help guide her replacement. With her death and the resulting disruption to both Reseune and Union, the second project is begun immediately.\n\nAri, the clone of Emory, is raised by Jane Strassen, a top Reseune scientist in her own right and the closest match to Emory's mother Olga. In addition, Florian and Catlin are replicated (a much easier task with azi). When Ari is seven, Strassen is abruptly transferred to another planet to simulate Olga's death. Denys Nye, now Reseune Administrator, takes over Ari's rearing. By this time, it is clear that the experiment has succeeded. Not only is Ari as brilliant as her predecessor, but due to technological advances, knowledge of the original's experiences, and better parenting by Jane Strassen, Ari is several years ahead of Emory's pace and better adjusted socially.\n\nWhen Ari is nearly nine, the Centrists, in a bid for power, attempt to use a scandal involving Emory – the deliberate abandonment of a secret colony on the planet Gehenna. The Reseune authorities have Ari legally recognized as Emory's clone, entitled to take possession of her predecessor's property, in order to block the release of potentially damaging information. Denys is forced to reveal to his young ward who she is and how much her life has been manipulated.\n\nBecause of deep Administration suspicion of his loyalties, Justin is warned to stay away from Ari. However, he cannot avoid bumping into her from time to time as she grows up. She comes to like him and appreciate his skills, particularly since his interests lie in her own area of research. Soon after she gains adult status, she has Justin and Grant transferred to her new department. However, when the sixteen-year-old makes a pass at him, she is shocked by his strong reaction. Justin is forced to reveal the reason. Ari discovers that Emory's rape of Justin had not just been for sex, but also a major \"intervention\" to free him from his father's domination, so he could work for Emory; it was left unfinished when she died. The younger Ari repairs the damage as best she can.\n\nAri also comes to terms with the fact that she is much like her predecessor; it is sometimes hard to know where Emory's memories stop and Ari's start. She takes up the original's ultra-secret agenda, revealed to her by Base One, her guiding computer program, and unknown to anyone else. Emory had undertaken to restructure Union society to, in her view, save it from eventual collapse.\n\nGiraud Nye had taken over Emory's seat in the Council of Nine after her death. A major political crisis is precipitated by his death from old age, as well as the Paxers – a terrorist group – manipulating Jordan. An attempt on Ari's life is barely foiled when Justin's just-in-time warning enables Florian and Catlin to deal with an unexpected would-be assassin. Such a major breach in security could only have come from a top-rank Reseune source. Ari suspects Denys Nye. When Denys tries to lure her in for another try by promising to resign, Florian and Catlin kill him, much to Ari's regret.\n\n\n\nIn 1989 the novel was published in a three-volume edition:\n\nCherryh has expressed her disapproval of this edition, writing, \"by my wishes, all future publications, will have Cyteen as one unified book.\"\n\n\n"}

Zawadzki was born in a tenement house at 58 Piękna Street. In the mid-1930s, the family moved to a flat on the ground floor of the so-called Professors' House at 75 Koszykowa Street, which was a part of the Polytechnic's buildings complex. During summer the Zawadzki family often stayed in their house at Queen Hedwig Street 11 in Zalesie Dolne.\n\nTadeusz Zawadzki began his studies at the Private School of the Society of the Mazovian School at Klonowa Street 16. In September 1933, he began his education at Stefan Batory State Gymnasium in Warsaw. In \"Batory\", Zawadzki continued his education in high school, in a class with mathematical and physical profile. Later soldiers of Warsaw Assault Groups: Jan Bytnar, Aleksy Dawidowski and Jan Wuttke studied in the same class.\n\nSince autumn 1933, Zawadzki was a member of the 23rd Warsaw Scouting Team \"Bolesław Chrobry\", called the \"Orangery\". He passed his Matura exam at the end of May 1939. After the outbreak of the war, he left Warsaw to the east on September 6 as a member of the scouting marching Warsaw Banner.\n\nZawadzki was active in the underground structures since October 1939, and when the scouts from the 23rd WDH formed the so-called War Orangery in 1941, he was elected commander of it under the alias \"Lech Pomarańczowy\" (Orange Lech).\n\nAt the same time, in December 1939 and January 1940, he took part in the activities of small sabotage of a secret left-wing organization Polish People's Independence Action. From January to July 1940, he was a courier in the prison cell of the ZWZ (organized by Captain Zygmunt Hempel and Halina Starczewska-Chorążyna, later headed by Kazimierz Gorzkowski).\n\nIn March 1941, together with his team, Zawadzki entered the Grey Ranks and took command over the Upper Mokotów Troup in the South District of the Warsaw Banner. This troup immediately joined the \"Wawer\" Small Sabotage Organization, in which \"Zośka\" was the commander of the Upper Mokotow District in the South District. At that time Tadeusz was one of the most outstanding executors of some of the most famous actions of small sabotage. For the largest number of \"anchors\" painted in his district, he was awarded the honorary title \"Kotwicki\" (Anchor-man) by the Commander-in-Chief of \"Wawer\" Aleksander Kamiński. Together with his troup, he also participated in the \"N\" Action (subversive propaganda in German conducted by BiP KG AK).\n\nAfter graduating from the Petty Scoutmaster Course (\" The School behind the Forest\") in May–June 1942, he received the rank of petty scoutmaster and the instructor pseudonym \"Kajman\" on August 15, 1942. On September 13, 1942, he organized all-day field exercises for his troop in the Chojnowski Forest near Warsaw.\n\nAs a result of the reorganization of the Warsaw Banner of the Grey Ranks in November 1942, under the alias \"Tadeusz\", Zawadzki became the troup leader of the \"Center\" hive, the commander of the Warsaw Banner Assault Groups (consisting of 4 troops), and at the same time the deputy of Lieutenant Ryszard Białous \"Jerzy\" – military commander of the GS, i.e. the Special Unit \"Jerzy\", one of the dispatching units of Home Army Kedyw (Directorate of Diversion) which established at that time.\n\nAfter graduating from the Substitute Course of the Officers' School of Infantry Reserves, in January 1943 he was appointed the rank of officer cadet.\n\nProbably at that time, due to the significant burden of organizational duties, he had to stop his education from 1940 onwards. Zawadzki studied at the State School of Machine Building – acting openly in place of the State Higher School of Machine and Electrical Engineering in Warsaw named after H. Wawelberg and S. Rotwand. From 1942 Zawadzki studied at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Higher State Technical School – i.e. the secret Warsaw University of Technology.\n\nIn the last days of April 1943, at his father's request, Zawadzki wrote a short report describing the activity of \"Orangery\" and the Grey Ranks, as well as the course of events during Operation Arsenal. It became the basis for Aleksander Kamiński's book Kamienie na szaniec [Stones for the Ramaprt].\n\nHe was arrested accidentally at the end of June or the beginning of July 1943, and spent a week or two in a correction labor camp at Gęsia Street (\"The Goose house\").\n\nAfter completing his first scouting course (May–June), he was awarded the title of scoutmaster on August 15, 1943. At that time he was appointed second lieutenant of the infantry reserve.\n\nHe died in an attack on the watchtower of Grenzschutzpolizei in Sieczychy near Wyszków on the night of August 20–21, 1943, taking part in the \"Tape\" action as an observer.\n\nHis name was given to the Home Army Battalion of the Grey Ranks – the Zośka Battalion.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298740", "title": "Conservatism in the United States", "text": "Conservatism in the United States\n\nConservatism in the United States is a political and social philosophy characterized by respect for American traditions, republicanism, support for Christian values, moral universalism, pro-business, anti-labor union, anti-communism, individualism, advocacy of American exceptionalism, and a defense of Western culture from the perceived threats posed by socialism, authoritarianism, and moral relativism.\n\nAs with all major American political parties, liberty is a core value. American conservatives generally consider individual liberty—within the bounds of American values—as the fundamental trait of democracy; this perspective contrasts with that of modern American liberals, who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice and emphasize the need for state intervention to achieve these goals. American political conservatives believe in limiting government in size and scope, and in a balance between national government and states' rights. Apart from some libertarians, they tend to favor strong action in areas they believe to be within government's legitimate jurisdiction, particularly national defense and law enforcement. Social conservatives often oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil unions, and would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. They favor Christian prayer in public schools and government funding for Christian schools.\n\nLike most American political ideologies, conservatism originates from republicanism, which rejected aristocratic and monarchical government and upheld the principles of the United States Declaration of Independence (\"All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\") and the United States Constitution (which established a federal republic under the rule of law). Conservative philosophy is also derived in part from the classical liberal tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries, which advocated for \"laissez-faire\" economics (i.e. economic freedom and deregulation).\n\nHistorians such as Patrick Allitt and political theorists such as Russell Kirk argue that the conservative tradition has played a major role in American politics and culture since 1776. However, they assert that an organized conservative movement with beliefs that differ from those of other American political parties has played a key role in politics only since the 1950s. The recent movement is based in the Republican Party; however, some White Southern Democrats were also important figures early in the movement's history. \nThe history of American conservatism has been marked by tensions and competing ideologies. Fiscal conservatives and libertarians favor small government, \"laissez-faire\" economy, low income and corporate taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Social conservatives see traditional social values as threatened by secularism; they tend to support school prayer and oppose abortion, same sex marriage, and civil unions.\n\nNeoconservatives want to expand what they see as American ideals throughout the world. Paleoconservatives advocate restrictions on immigration, non-interventionist foreign policy, and opposition to multiculturalism. Most conservative factions nationwide, except some libertarians, support a unilateral foreign policy, and a strong military. Most, especially libertarians, support gun ownership rights, citing the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands, stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of \"godless communism.\"\n\nIn the first 1955 issue of his magazine \"National Review\", William F. Buckley Jr. explained the standards of his magazine and helped make explicit the beliefs of American conservatives:\nAccording to Peter Viereck, American conservatism is distinctive because it was not tied to a monarchy, landed aristocracy, established church, or military elite. Instead American conservatives were firmly rooted in American republicanism, which European conservatives opposed. They are committed, says Seymour Martin Lipset, to the belief in America's \"superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly status-bound system of European society.\"\n\nIn terms of governmental economic policies, American conservatives have been heavily influenced by the classical liberal or libertarian tradition as expressed by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman and a major source of influence has been the Chicago school of economics. They have been strongly opposed to Keynesian economics.\n\nTraditional (Burkean) conservatives tend to be anti-ideological, and some would even say anti-philosophical, promoting, as Russell Kirk explained, a steady flow of \"prescription and prejudice\". Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives—the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as opposition to abortion and homosexuality. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce Christian morality.\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\". A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a death tax. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of Ludwig von Mises, believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"free market economics\" is the most efficient way to promote economic growth.\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy. Thus it was the British Labour government—which embraced socialism—that pushed the Truman administration in 1945–1947 to take a strong stand against Soviet Communism.\n\nSocial conservatism in the United States is the defense of traditional social norms and Judeo-Christian values.\n\nSocial conservatives tend to strongly identify with American nationalism and patriotism. They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\n\nFiscal conservatism is the economic and political policy that advocates restraint of progressive taxation and expenditure. Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as starve the beast. Activist Grover Norquist is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\" The argument in favor of balanced budgets is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement \"laissez-faire\" policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that classical liberalism in the United States during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of \"laissez-faire\". To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, \"laissez-faire\" did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more economic freedom. Economic liberalism can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader small government philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with free-market or \"laissez-faire\" economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the classical liberal tradition in the vein of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the Burkean notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the civil society is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by Alexis de Tocqueville, there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book \"Democracy in America\", Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century—the Margaret Thatcher government in Britain and the Ronald Reagan administration in the U.S.—both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism. To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending. Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%. This contrasts with statistics from 2004, when government spending was rising more rapidly than it had in decades.\n\nIn the United States today, the word \"conservative\" is often used very differently from the way it is used in Europe and Asia. Following the American Revolution, Americans rejected the core ideals of European conservatism; those ideals were based on the landed aristocracy, established churches, and powerful armies.\n\nConservatism in the United States is not a single school of thought. Barry Goldwater in the 1960s spoke for a \"free enterprise\" conservatism. Jerry Falwell in the 1980s preached traditional moral and religious social values. It was Ronald Reagan's challenge to form these groups into an electable coalition.\n\nIn the 21st century United States, types of conservatism include:\n\nIn the United States there has never been a national political party called the Conservative Party. Since 1962, there has been a small Conservative Party of New York State. During Reconstruction in several states in the South in the late 1860s, the former Whigs formed a Conservative Party. They soon merged into the state Democratic parties.\n\nAll major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, and that all men were created equal. Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.\n\nHistorian Patrick Allitt expresses the difference between liberal and conservative in terms not of policy but of attitude:\nCertain continuities can be traced through American history. The conservative 'attitude' [...] was one of trusting to the past, to long-established patterns of thought and conduct, and of assuming that novelties were more likely to be dangerous than advantageous.\n\nNo American party has advocated European ideals of \"conservatism\" such as a monarchy, an established church, or a hereditary aristocracy. American conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress. Russell Kirk saw the American Revolution itself as \"a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation\".\n\nPolitical conservatives have emphasized an identification with the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. Historians of conservative political thought \"generally label John Adams as the intellectual father of \"American\" conservatism.\" Russell Kirk points to John Adams as the key Founding Father for conservatives, noting that \"some writers regard him as America's most important conservative public man.\" Historian Clinton Rossiter writes:\nHistorian A. Owen Aldridge places Adams, \"At the head of the conservative ranks in the early years of the Republic and Jefferson as the leader of the contrary liberal current.\" It was a fundamental doctrine for Adams that all men are subject to equal laws of morality. He held that in society all men have a right to equal laws and equal treatment from the government. However, he added, \"no two men are perfectly equal in person, property, understanding, activity, and virtue.\" Peter Viereck concluded: \nHamilton, Adams, and their Federalist party sought to establish in the new world what they called a \"natural aristocracy.\" [It was to be] based on property, education, family status, and sense of ethical responsibility. [... Their motive was liberty itself.\n\nThere been numerous large veterans organizations in American history, most notably the Grand Army of the Republic, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946–1947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy. Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the \"American Legion Firing Line,\" a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the John Birch Society and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the John Birch Society. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan. The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9–11, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nIn 1962, the Supreme Court Engel v. Vitale decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 Abington School District v. Schempp decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the religious right and by 1980 were avid supporters of Ronald Reagan.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan set the conservative standard in the 1980s. In the 2010s, the Republican leaders typically claim fealty to it. For example, most of the Republican candidates in 2012 \"claimed to be standard bearers of Reagan's ideological legacy\". Reagan solidified conservative Republican strength with tax cuts, a greatly increased military budget, continued deregulation, a policy of rollback of Communism (rather than just containing it), and appeals to family values and conservative morality. The 1980s and beyond became known as the Reagan Era. Typically, conservative politicians and spokesmen in the 21st century proclaim their devotion to Reagan's ideals and policies on most social, economic, and foreign policy issues.\n\nOther modern conservative beliefs include global warming denial and opposition towards government action to combat it, which conservatives contend would do severe economic damage and ultimately more harm than good even if one accepts the premise that human activity is contributing to climate change. They support a strong policy of law and order to control crime, including long jail terms for repeat offenders. Most conservatives support the death penalty for particularly egregious crimes. The \"law and order\" issue was a major factor weakening liberalism in the 1960s. From 2001–2008, Republican President George W. Bush stressed cutting taxes and minimizing regulation of industry and banking, while increasing regulation of education. Conservatives generally advocate the use of American military power to fight terrorists and promote democracy in the Middle East.\n\nAccording to a 2014 Gallup Poll, 38% of American voters identify as \"conservative\" or \"very conservative,\" 34% as \"moderate,\" 24% as \"liberal\" or \"very liberal\". These percentages were fairly constant from 1990–2009, when conservatism spiked in popularity briefly before reverting to the original trend while liberal views on social issues reached a new high. Although, the study does show some distinction between the concentration of moderates and conservatives or liberals between the Republican and Democratic parties. Among Democrats, 44% are self-identified liberals, 19% as conservatives, and 36% as moderates. For Republicans 70% self-identified as conservative, 24% as moderate, and 5% as liberal.\n\nConservatism appears to be growing stronger at the state level. The trend is most pronounced among the \"least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states.\" according to \"Atlantic\" writer Richard Florida.\n\nConservatives generally believe that government action is not the solution to problems such as poverty and inequality. Many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose affirmative action policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \"reverse discrimination\".\n\nConservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.\n\nOn social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles. They oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, civil unions, and anti-discrimination laws against homosexuals. The libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues, instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy. Business-oriented conservatives oppose the social conservatives if state laws limiting gay rights threaten to hurt business. The \"National Review\" reported in 2016 that, \"as evangelical forces have become less unified...the influence of Right-leaning business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce has only grown.\" In the culture war of recent decades, multiculturalism has been a flashpoint, especially regarding the humanities curriculum. Historian Peter N. Stearns finds a polarization since the 1960s between conservatives who believe that the humanities express eternal truths that should be taught, and those who think that the humanities curriculum should be tailored to demonstrate diversity. Generally conservatism opposes the \"identity politics\" associated with multiculturalism, and supports individualism. In campus battles, progressives demand \"Cultural diversity\" while conservatives denounce efforts to impose \"political correctness\" and stifle free speech.\n\nConservatives typically favor a \"melting pot\" model of assimilation into common English-speaking American culture, as opposed to a \"salad bowl\" approach that lends legitimacy to many different cultures. In the 21st century, conservatives have warned on the dangers of tolerating radical Islamic elements, of the sort that they say are engaging in large-scale terrorism in Europe.\n\nIn the United States, the Republican Party has been the party of conservatism since the 1890s, although there was a strong Eastern liberal wing. Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, based in the South and strongly opposed to Civil Rights, grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3–1 Democratic to 3–1 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the Libertarian Party and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes—for instance, further dismantling the welfare system or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the Cato Institute, and libertarian intellectuals such as David Boaz describe libertarianism as being \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support protectionism instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.\n\nThe South, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountain states, and Alaska are generally conservative strongholds. The Northeast, Great Lakes Region, West Coast and Hawaii are the main liberal strongholds. In the 21st century, rural areas of the United States (blue-collar, evangelical, older than other areas of the U.S., and predominantly white) are generally conservative bastions. Voters in the urban cores of large metropolitan areas tend to be more liberal and Democratic. Thus, there is a division between urban, suburban, exurban, and rural areas within each state.\n\nRussell Kirk developed six \"canons\" of conservatism, which Gerald J. Russello described as follows:\n\nKirk said that Christianity and Western civilization are \"unimaginable apart from one another\" and that \"all culture arises out of religion. When religious faith decays, culture must decline, though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief.\"\n\nIn later works, Kirk expanded this list into his \"Ten Principles of Conservatism\" which are as follows:\n\nOne stream of conservatism exemplified by William Howard Taft extols independent judges as experts in fairness and the final arbiters of the Constitution. In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, a liberal Democrat, did not attack the Supreme Court directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the Conservative coalition. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937–60.\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power. A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the Warren Court in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to Abraham Lincoln's attacks on the Dred Scott decision of 1857.\n\nA more recent variant that emerged in the 1980s is originalism, the assertion that the United States Constitution should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted. Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, strict constructionism, which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, former federal judge Robert Bork and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.\n\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\nThe federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\nToday's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.\n\nIn the past, conservatives have supported conservation efforts, from the protection of the Yosemite Valley, to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, more recently, conservatives have opposed environmentalism; with environmentalists often ridiculed as \"tree huggers\". Republican Party leaders such as Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann advocate the abolition of the EPA, calling it \"the job-killing organization of America.\"\n\nConservative think tanks since the 1990s have opposed the concept of man-made global warming; challenged scientific evidence; publicized what they perceived as beneficial aspects of global warming, and asserted that proposed remedies would do more harm than good. The concept of anthropogenic global warming continues to be an ongoing debate among conservatives in the United States, but most conservatives reject the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans. A 2015 poll showed that 73% of Republicans believed humans were uninvolved in causing global warming.\n\nAmerican conservatives have generally supported deregulation of pollution and reduced restrictions on carbon emissions. Similarly, they have advocated increased oil drilling with less regulatory interference, including oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In the 2008 election, the phrase, \"Drill baby drill\" was used to express the Republican position on the subject.\n\nPresident Donald Trump rolled back over 76 Obama-administration rules regarding the environment. President Trump also announced that the U.S. would stop making payments to the United Nations program \"Green Climate Fund\".\n\nThe term \"socialist\" has been used as a \"rhetorical weapon\" against the left by conservatives. David Hinshaw writes that William Allen White, editor of a small-town newspaper in Kansas from 1895, used \"socialistic\" as \"his big gun to blast radical opposition.\" White set \"Americanism\" as the alternative, warning, \"The election will sustain Americanism or it will plant Socialism.\" White became famous when Mark Hanna, campaign manager for Republican candidate William McKinley distributed upwards of a million or more copies of one White editorial to rally opposition to William Jennings Bryan, the nominee of both the Democratic and Populist parties.\n\nBy the 1950s, the conservative press had discovered that the word 'socialism' \"proved to be a successful derogatory epithet rather than a descriptive label for a meaningful political alternative.\" At the 1952 Republican national convention, former President Herbert Hoover repeated his warnings about two decades of New Deal policies, denouncing, says Gary Best, \"The usurpation of power by the federal government, the loss of freedom in America, the poisoning of the American economy with fascism, socialism, and Keynesianism, the enormous growth of the federal bureaucracy.\" Barry Goldwater in 1960 called for Republican unity against John F. Kennedy and the \"blueprint for socialism presented by the Democrats.\" Goldwater in 1964 attacked central planners like fellow Republican Nelson Rockefeller, implying he was a socialist in a millionaire's garb: \"The Democratic party believes in what I call socialism: and if that upsets anybody's stomach, let me remind you that central planning of our economy is socialism.\" Ronald Reagan often quoted Norman Thomas, the perennial Socialist nominee for president in the New Deal era, as saying, \"The American people would never knowingly vote for Socialism, but that under the name of liberalism, they would adopt every fragment of the socialist program.\" In 2010, Newt Gingrich defined \"socialism in the broad sense\" as \"a government-dominated, bureaucratically-controlled, politician-dictated way of life.\" Gingrich believes Barack Obama is committed to this form of socialism.\n\nConservatives gained a major new communications medium with the resurgence of talk radio in the late 1980s. William G. Mayer, reports that \"conservatives dominate talk radio to an overwhelming, remarkable degree.\" This dominance enabled them to spread their message much more effectively to the general public, which had previously been confined to the major Big Three television networks. Political scientists Jeffrey M. Berry and Sarah Sobieraj conclude that, \"conservatives like talk radio because they believe it tells them the truth. Liberals appear to be much more satisfied with the mainstream media and are more likely to believe that it is accurate.\"\n\nRush Limbaugh proved there was a huge nationwide audience for specific and heated discussions of current events from a conservative viewpoint. Other major hosts who describe themselves as conservative include: Michael Peroutka, Jim Quinn, Dennis Miller, Ben Ferguson, William Bennett, Andrew Wilkow, Lars Larson, Sean Hannity, G. Gordon Liddy, Laura Ingraham, Mike Church, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin, Michael Savage, Kim Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Michael Reagan, Jason Lewis, Ken Hamblin, and Herman Cain. The Salem Radio Network syndicates a group of religiously oriented Republican activists, including Roman Catholic Hugh Hewitt, and Jewish conservatives Dennis Prager and Michael Medved. One popular Jewish conservative, Laura Schlessinger, offers parental and personal advice, but is outspoken on social and political issues. In 2011, the largest weekly audiences for talk radio were 15 million for Limbaugh and 14 million for Hannity, with about nine million each for Glenn Beck, Michael Savage and Mark Levin. The audiences overlap, depending on how many each listener dials into every week.\n\nFox News features conservative hosts. One such host is Sean Hannity, who also has a talk radio program. One former host is Matt Drudge; prior, and after his time on Fox News, Drudge has operated \"Drudge Report\" a news aggregation website and is a self-professed conservative. It is more conservative than other news sources in the United States, such as National Public Radio and CNN. Canadian-American political commentator David Frum has been a critic of this development, and has argued that the influence of conservative talk radio and Fox News has harmed American conservatism, turning it from \"a political philosophy into a market segment\" for extremism and conflict making \"for bad politics but great TV.\"\n\nLiberal and leftist viewpoints have dominated higher education faculties since the 1970s, according to many studies, whereas conservatives are better represented in policy-oriented think tanks. Data from a survey conducted in 2004 indicated that 72% of full-time faculty identify as liberal, while 9–18% self-identify as conservative. Conservative self-identification is higher in two-year colleges than other categories of higher education but has been declining overall. Those in natural sciences, engineering, and business were less liberal than those in the social sciences and humanities. A 2005 study found that liberal views had increased compared to the older studies. 15% in the survey described themselves as center-right. While the humanities and the social sciences are still the most left leaning, 67% of those in other fields combined described themselves as center-left on the spectrum. In business and engineering, liberals outnumber conservatives by a 2:1 ratio. The study also found that more women, practicing Christians, and Republicans taught at lower ranked schools than would be expected from objectively measured professional accomplishments.\n\nA study by psychologists Yoel Inbar and Joris Lammars, of the Netherlands' Tilburg University, published in September 2012 in the journal \"Perspectives on Psychological Science\", found that, in social and personality psychology, about a third of those surveyed say that they would to a small extent favor a liberal point of view over a conservative point of view. A 2007 poll found that 58% of Americans thought that college professors' political bias was a \"serious problem\". This varied depending on the political views of those asked. 91% of \"very conservative\" adults agreed compared with only 3% of liberals. That same year a documentary, \"Indoctrinate U\", was released which focuses on the perceived bias within academia.\n\nOn the other hand, liberal critic Paul Krugman wrote in \"The New York Times\" that this phenomenon is more due to personal choice than some kind of discrimination or conspiracy, noting that, for example, vocations such as military officers are much more likely to be filled by conservatives rather than liberals. Additionally, two studies published in the journal of the American Political Science Association have suggested that the political orientations of college students' professors have little influence or \"indoctrination\" in terms of students' political belief.\n\nPostmodernism is an approach common in the humanities at universities that greatly troubles conservative intellectuals. The issue is relativism versus absolute truths. Ellen Grigsby says, \"Postmodern perspectives contend that any ideology putting forward absolute statements as timeless truths should be viewed with profound skepticism.\" Kellner says, \"Postmodern discourse frequently argues that all discourses and values are socially constructed and laden with interests and biases. Against postmodern and liberal relativism, cultural conservatives have argued for values of universal truth and absolute standards of right and wrong.\"\n\nNeoconservative historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has energetically rejected postmodern academic approaches:\n[Postmodernism in history] is a denial of the objectivity of the historian, of the factuality or reality of the past, and thus of the possibility of arriving at any truths about the past. For all disciplines it induces a radical skepticism, relativism, and subjectivism that denies not this or that truth about any subject but the very idea of truth—that denies even the ideal of truth, truth is something to aspire to even if it can never be fully attained.\n\nJay Stevenson wrote the following representative summary of postmodern literary studies of the sort that antagonize conservatives:\n[In the postmodern period,] traditional literature has been found to have been written by \"dead white males\" to serve the \"ideological\" aims of a conservative and repressive Anglo \"hegemony\". [...] In an array of reactions against the race, gender, and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of Anglo lit, multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose, resist, and redress injustices and prejudices. These prejudices are often covert—disguised in literature and other discourses as positive ideals and objective truths—but they slant our sense of reality in favor of power and privilege.\n\nConservative intellectuals have championed a \"high conservative modernism\" that insists that universal truths exist, and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths. Many argued that natural law was the repository of timeless truths. Allan Bloom, in his highly influential \"The Closing of the American Mind\" (1987) argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great classics that shaped Western culture. His book was widely cited by conservative intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativists.\n\nIn recent years, historians have agreed that they need to rethink the role of conservatism in recent American history. An important new approach rejects the older consensus that liberalism was the dominant ethos. Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933–1938) and the Great Society (1964–1966). However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated. The movement was as fragile as the New Deal coalition that it replaced. [...] Policy change has thus proved to be much more difficult than conservatives hoped for.\" Zelizer does find four areas where conservatives did make major changes, namely retrenchment of domestic programs, lowering taxes, deregulation, and opposition to labor unions. He concludes, \"The fact is that liberalism survived the rise of conservatism.\"\n\nAmerican conservatives typically promote American exceptionalism, the idea that the United States is inherently different from other nations and has a duty to take the lead in spreading democracy and free markets to the world. Reagan especially articulated this role (and many liberals also agree with it). They see American values emerging from the American Revolution, thereby becoming what political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset called \"the first new nation\" and developing a uniquely American ideology, \"Americanism\", based on liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, republicanism, democracy, \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and Judeo-Christian values.\n\nAlthough the term does not necessarily imply superiority, many neoconservative and other American conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense. To them, the U.S. is like the biblical \"City upon a Hill\"—a phrase evoked by Puritan settlers in Massachusetts as early as 1630—and exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries.\n\nScholars have argued that British and European conservatism has little or no relevance to American traditions. According to political scientist Louis Hartz, because the United States skipped the feudal stage of history, the American community was united by liberal principles, and the conflict between the \"Whig\" and \"Democratic\" parties were conflicts within a liberal framework. In this view, what is called \"conservatism\" in America is not European conservatism (with its royalty, landowning aristocracy, elite officer corps, and established churches) but rather 19th century classical liberalism with an emphasis on economic freedom and entrepreneurship. This is in contrast to the view that Burkean conservatism has a set of universal principles which can be applied to all societies. In \"The Conservative Mind\", Russell Kirk argued that the American Revolution was \"a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation\". Liberal historian Richard Hofstader criticized modern American conservatives as \"pseudo-conservatives\" because their negative reaction to the policies of Harry Truman showed \"dissatisfaction with American life, traditions and institutions\" and because they had \"little in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism\".\n\nIn \"Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences\" three respected scholars provide an in-depth psychological explanation of how a person's genetic makeup predisposes them to be liberal or conservative. The book provides telling examples of how people as erudite and thoughtful as William F. Buckley Jr., Gore Vidal, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson descend to insults, lawsuits, duels, and slander when they are unable to defend their positions by rational argument.\n\nClinton Rossiter, a leading expert on American political history, published his history of \"Conservatism in America\" (1956) and also a summary article on \"The Giants of American Conservatism\" in \"American Heritage\". His goal was to identify the \"great men who did conservative deeds, thought conservative thoughts, practiced conservative virtues, and stood for conservative principles.\" To Rossiter, conservatism was defined by the rule of the upper class. He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Elihu Root, and Theodore Roosevelt. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in James Madison, James Wilson, Roger Sherman, John Dickinson, Gouverneur Morris and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against Jacksonian democracy include Joseph Story and Josiah Quincy in Massachusetts; Chancellor James Kent in New York; James Madison, James Monroe, and John Randolph of Roanoke in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that Grover Cleveland, Elihu Root, William Howard Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism—especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.\n\nWriting in 1955, Rossiter suggests that Robert A. Taft, Charles Evans Hughes, and Dwight D. Eisenhower may someday be added to the list.\n\n\n \n"}

It is situated in Val Susa, from the French border. Its name derives from Latin: \"ad petram sistrariam\", that is at sixty Roman miles from Turin.\n\nSestriere has 929 inhabitants and is located on the pass that links Val Chisone and Val Susa, at above mean sea level\nThe village is completely surrounded by mountains, which have been exploited to build one of the biggest ski resorts in Italy. The main mountains around Sestriere are: Monte Fraiteve in the north-east, Monte Sises , Punta Rognosa di Sestriere and Monte Motta in the south-east. Sestriere is divided into several smaller hamlets: Sestriere Colle, on the pass top, Sestriere Borgata, in Val Chisone, Champlas du Col and Champlas Janvier, in Val Susa.\n\nFormerly, the pass belonged to the municipality of Cesana, but from 18 October 1934 the area was unified with the hamlet of Borgata (formerly belonging to Pragelato) to create the new municipality of Sestriere.\nThe ski resorts at Sestriere were built in the 1930s by Giovanni Agnelli and have been further developed after the Second World War by his nephew Giovanni Nasi.\n\nSestriere is a popular skiing resort; during the winter holidays the population goes up to about 20,000 people. Together with the villages of Pragelato, Claviere, Sauze d'Oulx, Cesana Torinese and San Sicario, and Montgenèvre in France, it makes up the Via Lattea (Milky Way) skiing area. Sestriere is connected to 146 skiable pistes, for a total of up to of trails, of which 120 are provided with artificial snow.\nSestriere has also one of the few facilities where it is possible to ski at night on a floodlit run.\n\nIt regularly hosts FIS Alpine Ski World Cup events, and it hosted the FIS World Championships in 1997, and the IPC World Championships in 2011. It was a main venue during the 2006 Winter Olympic Games and the 2006 Winter Paralympics, hosting all the men's alpine skiing competitions and being the site of one of the three Olympic Villages.\nThe two hotel towers, one of which was part of the Olympic Village, were built in the 1930s by FIAT's founder Giovanni Agnelli, and have become the symbol of the village; these were the first buildings of the village.\n\nPragelato - the resort is part of the Via Lattea (Milky Way), is connected to this area by the Pattemouche-Anfiteatro cableway, built in 2006. \nClaviere - This small resort is just over the border in Italy and is included in the Monts de la lune lift pass. It is where the Olympic cross country ski teams practised for the Olympics in 2006.\n\nSan Sicario - The biathlon and Alpine skiing events were held there in the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. They also held the bobsleigh and luge events here. One can attempt the Olympic women's super G and downhill courses.\n\nSauze d'Oulx - Free Style Skiing Olympic events held here in 2006. The resort is acclaimed for its lively après-ski.\n\nSerre Chevalier - Nearby French resort with over of skiing. There is a free day of skiing here on your lift pass.\n\nMontgenèvre - Nearby French resort with over of pistes. Montgenevre's ski area has 8 green runs, 12 blue, 22 red and 10 black slopes and is linked to the Via Lattea (Milky Way) ski area. There is a free day of skiing here on your lift pass.\n\nIn the summertime it is possible to play golf on Europe's highest 18-hole course.\n\nIt is also a starting and arrival point in the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia. It was the scene of the moment in Lance Armstrong's career when he rode away from the field in a breakaway uphill finish to take the stage in the 1999 Tour de France, which was the first time he won the race, although he was later stripped of his seven victories.\n\nDue to its location across two valleys, Sestriere is close to several hiking paths.\n\nSestriere organized an International Athletics Meeting from 1988 until 1995 and in 2004. Due to Sestiere's altitude the organizers aimed to meet conditions that enabled athletes to perform on world record level. The Ferrari company sponsored the meeting and set a new Ferrari car as prize for breaking world records.\n\nDue to its position, Sestriere can only be reached by car or bus.\n\nTrains from Torino stop in Oulx (Val Susa). From there, several buses bring passengers to Sestriere.\n\nThe highway also stops in Oulx, but a municipal road leads to the village in 20 minutes.\n\n"}

The company also operates out of six other offices in New York, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, Munich and Shanghai. As of December 2017, the firm, including its various predecessors, have raised approximately $51 billion (USD) since 1981. Apax Partners is one of the oldest and largest private equity firms operating on an international basis, ranked the fourteenth largest private equity firm globally.\n\nApax invests exclusively in certain business sectors including: telecommunications, technology, retail and consumer products, healthcare and financial and business services.\n\nApax raises capital for its investment funds through institutional investors including corporate and public pension funds, university and college endowments, foundations and fund of funds. One of the firm's co-founders, Alan Patricof, was an early investor in Apple Computer and America Online (AOL).\n\nApax Partners Worldwide is the product of the combination of three firms:\n\nIn 1969, Alan Patricof founded Patricof & Co. a firm dedicated to making investments in \"development capital\" later known as \"venture capital,\" primarily in small early-stage companies. Patricof, one of the early venture capitalists, was involved in the development of numerous major companies including America Online, Office Depot, Cadence Design Systems, Apple Computer and FORE Systems. In 1975, Patricof launched 53rd Street Ventures, a $10 million vehicle.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1972, Sir Ronald Cohen and Maurice Tchénio, along with two other partners, founded Multinational Management Group (MMG) with offices in London, Paris, and Chicago. MMG initially was established as an advisory firm, working with small emerging companies, rather than an investment firm. However, MMG initially struggled to gain traction amid the negative economic conditions, particularly in the UK in the mid-1970s.\n\nBy 1977, two of the original four founding partners had left MMG, leaving Cohen and Tchénio in need of a partner to help rejuvenate their firm. In that year, Cohen approached Alan Patricof to join them and run the new firm's investments in the U.S. The new firm would be known as Alan Patricof Associates (APA) and ultimately come to be known as Apax Partners (based on a play on Patricof's name: Alan Patricof Associates Cross (x) Border). Following the merger, MMG abandoned its advising business, and the new APA shifted its focus exclusively to investing in start-up companies.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the firm grew steadily raising capital under a series of separate funds. As the 1980s progressed, the firm introduced its first later stage venture fund in 1984, its first growth capital fund in 1987 and its first dedicated European leveraged buyout fund MMG Patricof European Buy-In Fund in 1989. In response to the changing conditions, in the venture capital industry in the 1980s Apax (and other early venture capital firms including Warburg Pincus and J.H. Whitney & Company) began to transition away from venture capital toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments, which were in vogue in that decade. This trend was more prevalent in Europe than the U.S. where Patricof preferred to continue focusing on venture investments.\n\nIn 1991, Apax Partners became the official name for all of its European operations however the U.S. business still operated under the Patricof & Co. name. By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally.\n\nIn 2000, Patricof & Co. adopted the Apax Partners branding and formalized its affiliation with its European business. The U.S. business would operate as Apax Partners, Inc. The following year, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies. In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form Greycroft Partners which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments.\n\nDespite the closer relations between the U.S. and European teams, the firm still operated separate fund entities for each geography. The European side of the business began to pull away in terms of capital commitments, raising more than $5 billion for its 2004 vintage European fund but just $1 billion for its 2006 U.S. vintage fund.\n\nIn 2005, Apax announced it would acquire middle market leveraged buyout firm Saunders Karp & Megrue to augment its buyout business in the United States. Saunders Karp, formerly based in Stamford, Connecticut, was founded in 1989 by Thomas A. Saunders III and Allan W. Karp. John Megrue, who today serves as co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, had worked as a principal at Patricof & Co. before joining Saunders Karp in 1992. Saunders Karp had received capital commitments from institutional investors including AT&T Corporation, the General Electric Pension Trust, Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group, HarbourVest Partners, JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, New York State Common Retirement Fund and Verizon, among others.\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the demerger, transfer of assets and subsequent collapse of the British United Shoe Machinery in 2000 led to questions about Apax's behaviour being raised in Parliament by MPs of both main parties. After calls for an enquiry into the loss of hundreds of pensions were refused, Ros Altmann, the pensions expert and, as of 2015, UK Pensions minister described it \"one of the worst cases ..I have seen ..the actions of the former owners - Apax have been immoral.\" The politician Ashok Kumar said, \"I think these people needed flogging\" ..these are greedy, selfish, capitalists who live on the backs of others.\n\nFollowing its sale of Wind Hellas in 2007, Apax and Hellas co-owner TPG were sued by former bondholders of the telecom company, who allege that Apax and TPG unjustifiably enriched themselves from Hellas and misrepresented the true state of its accounts. Apax has countered that some of these bondholders only began their dispute after passing up on the chance of selling prior to the bankruptcy of 2009, and that Apax sold the business in 2007 (almost three years before the bankruptcy) and so was not the legal owner of Hellas during the periods cited in some of the lawsuits. (In 2005 a New York judge awarded $56m to some of these bondholders, made against Hellas Telecommunications Finance and Hellas Finance, rather than Apax or TPG). Other lawsuits related to Apax and TPG's ownership of Hellas are being heard in the USA. In December 2015 a separate legal action brought by the liquidators of Hellas Telecommunications was dismissed by a Luxembourg court. In February 2018 the liquidators abandoned their UK case against Apax and TPG after four days of trial.\n\n\n"}

They first appeared in \"Adventure Comics\" #346 (July 1966), as enemies of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century.\n\nThe Khunds controlled a vast galactic empire. In the 30th and the 31st centuries, their relationship with the United Planets fluctuated between uneasy détente and open warfare. When the U.P. first discovered the Khundian civilization, the Khunds responded by attempting to conquer Earth. They nearly succeeded with the assistance of Nemesis Kid, a saboteur whom they planted in the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, Nemesis Kid was exposed and the invasion was repelled.\n\nThe Khunds opposed the U.P. and the Legion at numerous times in the future. For example, the Khunds and the Dark Circle invaded Earth during the so-called \"Earthwar\". It was soon revealed that both groups were being manipulated by the sorcerer Mordru, who almost conquered Earth before being defeated by the Legion.\n\nDuring the \"Five Years Later\" arc of Legion continuity, Mordru casts a massive spell allowing him to animate and control the corpses of dead warriors throughout United Planets territory, and use them as an invasion force. U.P. worlds which were conquered by the Khundian empire are not spared from this phenomenon, prompting the Khunds to form a temporary alliance with the Legion. Four superpowered Khunds join the Legion: Firefist, a cyborg; his wife Veilmist, a teleporter; Blood Claw, who possesses indestructible claws; and Flederweb, a winged bounty hunter.\n\nIncluded in the animated undead force that invaded the planet Sklar are corpses of the many deceased members of the Legion. Blood Claw is killed by Magnetic Kid's undead body. Firefist attempts to murder Devlin O'Ryan, but is seemingly killed himself when Devlin's reflective power repels the Khund's weapon blast back at him. The group manages to defeat Mordru, and the Khunds force Veilmist and Flederweb to resign from the Legion. Some time later, it is revealed that Firefist survived, and that the Khunds have initiated a plot to destroy Weber's World. Veilmist offers to assist the Legion in foiling the plot, but is killed by Firefist. Flederweb is revealed to be not a Khund, but a mind-controlled member of an unspecified alien race. After he is freed from Khundian control and helps the Legion save Weber's World, Flederweb joins the Heroes of Lallor.\n\nThe events of the \"Five Years Later\" era were erased from mainstream DC continuity following the \"\" limited series. Thus, the saga of the Khundian Legionnaires is currently viewed as non-canonical. However, Veilmist, Firefist, and a shot of Flederweb's arm appeared in \"\" #5, among dozens of Legionnaires pulled out of alternate realities.\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st Centuries, the Khunds were extreme enemies of the Thanagarians because of their planetary proximity. They superficially resemble humans, but average larger and more muscular in build, with pale magenta skin. Khunds have codified rules of combat. Khund bodies have much denser bone and muscle tissue than humans. The planet Khundia is a heavy gravity world. The Khunds were part of the alien group that attacks Earth in the \"Invasion!\" crossover. In \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 3) #19 it is revealed the Khund homeworld had been devastated by the attack of the aliens called 'Ichor'. With the assistance of Etta Candy and Wonder Woman, the Khund homeworld is saved and they gain their own Green Lantern protector.\n\n\n\n"}

Influenced by early Baroque principles, the church was remodeled by Andrea Pozzo between 1703 and 1705. The Jesuit Church is located on Dr. Ignaz Seipel-Platz, immediately adjacent to the old University of Vienna buildings.\n\nThe Jesuit Church was built between 1623 and 1627 on the site of an earlier chapel, at the time when the Jesuits merged their own college with the University of Vienna's philosophy and theology faculty. The emperor broke ground for both college and church, with the church itself dedicated to Saints Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier.\n\nIn 1703, Brother Andrea Pozzo, S.J., an architect, painter, and sculptor, and a master in the quadratura, was requested by Emperor Leopold I to redecorate the church. He added twin towers and reworked the façade in an early Baroque style with narrow horizontal and vertical sections. The design of the windows, narrow niches (with statues), and the small central part of the façade deviate from the Baroque style of the towers. Pozzo died unexpectedly in 1709, just before he was to move to Venice, and was buried in the church.\n\nAfter the completion of the work, the church was re-dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.\n\nDespite its relatively austere exterior, the interior is remarkably opulent with ersatz marble pillars, gilding and a number of allegorical ceiling frescoes. The semicircular vault ceiling was divided in four bays with paintings in perspective, using illusionary techniques.

The car had been favorably received for its overall performance and many amenities but criticized for its harsh ride. The TR4's Hotchkiss drive system was replaced with an independent rear suspension, indicated by an \"IRS\" badge attached to the TR4A's rear.\n\nThe new rear suspension was a semi-trailing arm system with coil springs and lever-arm shocks. This system more closely resembled that of the Triumph 2000 than the swing axle systems used in the Herald or Spitfire. The chassis was redesigned to accommodate the new suspension at the rear, with extensive changes to the side members and cross-bracing. The redesign had the desired effect, with reviewers commenting on the improved ride comfort, although some felt that the car's handling had not improved.\n\nThe chassis revisions resulted in a car roughly wider than the TR4, although length and height were unaffected. The wheelbase was shorter. The front track was unchanged, while the rear track grew by with the IRS. The car was heavier by .\n\nAlthough consideration was given to both an enlarged 2.5 liter four-cylinder or a six-cylinder engine, the TR4A used the same long-stroke, high-torque Standard four-cylinder wet-sleeve engine seen in the TR4. While the bore, stroke, and displacement remained the same, changes to the cylinder head and manifolds raised net power to and torque to , an increase of 10 percent.\n\nApart from the increase in width and the IRS badge on the rear of the car, other changes included a revised grille and new hood badge. There was also a new line of chrome trim on the side, starting near the rear edge of the door and ending at the front of the car with integrated signal/marker lights, which were moved from their earlier position in the corners of the grille. New smaller front bumpers and a convertible top patterned after the one from the Herald completed the exterior differences. On the interior the fly-off handbrake lever was moved to the transmission tunnel between two revised seats, the gearshift lever was shortened and the white painted steel dashboard was now always covered by walnut, which had been optional in the TR4.\n\nIn 1965 the TR4A IRS sold in the UK for approximately £968. Wire wheels added £36, overdrive £51, heater £13 and seat belts £4 each;.\n\nThe TR4A continued to offer the \"Surrey Top\" hard top system as an option. This weather protection system comprises a rigid rear back light, a removable rigid roof panel and a soft fabric panel that was the actual surrey-top. The back light is attached to the rear of the passenger area semi-permanently. Either the roof panel or the soft surrey top bridge the gap between the top of the windshield surround and the top of the back light. This aesthetically foreshadowed the silhouette of Targa top cars.\n\nIn response to requests from United States distributors Bud Forman and Les Genser Triumph developed a version of the TR4A fitted with a TR4-style rear live axle and made IRS an extra-cost option for that market. To locate the newly re-introduced leaf springs, spring brackets were added to the revised chassis. Live axle cars received a commissioning number (Triumph did not use serial numbers) that started with \"CT\". This was the same prefix used for TR4s. IRS equipped cars' commissioning numbers began with \"CTC\". The price in the United States was just under $2500.\n\nEven though the SCCA declined to homologate the TR4A in 1965, Kas Kastner, Triumph's US Competition Manager, and his modified \"Super Stock\" TR4A were able to win a D-modified National Championship in 1965 at Daytona with driver Charlie Gates.\n\nBob Tullius' Group 44 and others successfully campaigned these cars during the 1965 to 1973 seasons, accumulating a respectable collection of finishes.\n\nThe apex of the TR4A's racing history is the team win by three TR4A IRS models at the Sebring 12-hour race of 1966, finishing 1st, 2nd and 3rd in their class.\n\nIn 1968 the TR4A's venerable four-cylinder engine was replaced by Triumph's 2.5-litre straight-6. In the UK and most other markets it was equipped with Lucas fuel injection and called the TR5. In the United States price pressure and tighter emissions standards resulted in an otherwise identical but much less powerful car being fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetters, called the TR250.\n\nIn Q1 2011 there were approximately 789 licensed and 153 SORN TR4As registered with the DVLA.\n\n"}

{"id": "2298801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298801", "title": "Batting order (cricket)", "text": "Batting order (cricket)\n\nIn cricket, the batting order is the sequence in which batters play through their team's innings, there always being two batters taking part at any one time. All eleven players in a team are required to bat if the innings is completed (i.e., if the innings does not close early due to a declaration or other factor).\n\nThe batting order is colloquially subdivided into:\n\nThe order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established before the start of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities; the position each batter is most comfortable with; each player's skills and attributes as a batter; possible combinations with other batters; and the match situation whereby, for example, the team may require a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the innings. Also, a middle order batter in Tests may open for ODIs and Twenty20 due to their controlled approach to the game.\n\nThe captain of the team can change the batting order during the game at his or her discretion. They can even change the batting line-up from one game to another in a tournament or series. There are no rules about the nature or number of changes made and, if more than one innings is played, the order used in each need not be the same. It has even been known for a captain to completely reverse his batting order for the second innings after following on. This has made it possible for a bowler to take a hat-trick across three consecutive overs of a match, including the same batsman twice.\n\nThere are various reasons why the captain might make a change from the established order. Usually, however, captains and coaches prefer not to adjust the batting order unless necessary, as for example when South Africa moved Imran Tahir up the order against India because the South African top 7 batsmen were poor against spin bowlers, a plan which backfired spectacularly. In 2017, Faf du Plessis, who returned to the side as Test Captain after paternity leave, decided to make many changes to the batting lineup before the second test against England after being handed a heavy defeat. Du Plessis replaced JP Duminy at no. 5, and moved Quinton de Kock from 5 to 4 (de Kock already moved from no. 7 to 5 between the 1st and 2nd innings of the first Test), and due to the suspension of Kagiso Rabada due to demerit points, so Duanne Olivier replaced him, Philander moved up a spot to no. 7, while Theunis de Bruyn was replaced by Chris Morris at no. 8.\n\nIf the state of the game requires runs to be scored quickly, a captain will often promote a batter who is known to score quickly up the order. This is usually a lower-order batter, as their wicket is not regarded as being so valuable. A batter who is promoted up the order with the intention of scoring quick runs is called a pinch hitter or slogger. Some examples of a pinch hitter would be David Miller, Glenn Maxwell, Shahid Afridi & Thisara Perera.\n\nWhen a wicket falls near the end of the day, a lower order (less capable) batter might be sent in to bat with the intention that the more capable players will be held in reserve until the next morning. The more capable players are then not exposed to the risk of dismissal while tired or in low-light conditions. The batter who is sent in is known as the nightwatchman. This tactic is also used because players are typically nervous and unsettled at the start of the innings before settling into their rhythm and becoming \"set\". Sending a specialist batter in late in the day means that he or she will have to survive one such period in the afternoon, before doing the same again after the resumption of play the next day, increasing the chance of a dismissal, so a less valuable batter is sent in instead.\n\nThe opening batsmen or openers are the batters who bat first in the innings (no. 1 and 2). This position is important as the openers need to get the innings off to a good start. The early fall of wickets can have a psychological impact on the rest of the team, affecting their performance with the bat. The opening batters also get the first experience of the pitch and conditions, and must be able to adjust to them quickly.\n\nMost importantly, the opening batters must face a new ball, which is hard and has a pronounced seam. This makes it more liable to travel fast, bounce high, seam around (i.e., bounce unpredictably off the seam) and swing (i.e., deviate sideways when travelling through the air). These early conditions favour the bowling team, so the opening batters must have considerable patience, a sound technique and be good defensively. As the ball gets older, its condition starts to favour the batting team. Therefore, the openers will ideally stay at the crease long enough to protect the batters further down the order.\n\nIn first-class cricket, the rate at which the openers score runs is not as important as \"taking the shine off\" the new ball. This is the process of softening and roughening the cricket ball, whose condition tends to degrade the longer it is in play. By occupying the crease for a long time and taking the shine off the ball, the openers themselves are able to score more freely later on. This also makes batting easier for the rest of the order. Because of the defensive technique required early on, openers are sometimes less fluent stroke-players than the specialist batters who follow.\n\nIn limited overs cricket, the role of opening batter is slightly different. In this type of cricket a high run rate is a necessity. Also, in the early 1990s, fielding restrictions were introduced in the early overs of the game, limiting the fielding side to only two players on the boundary. To start the innings effectively and take advantage of the fielding restrictions, it became beneficial to have an aggressive batsman opening the innings.\n\nIf an opening batter remains not out at the end of the team's innings, after all 10 other batters have been dismissed, he or she is said to have carried the bat.\n\nThe top order is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 1, 2, and 3. The batsmen who bat at positions 3, 4 and 5 in the order are sometimes the most technically proficient batsmen with the best stroke play. As they are likely to face an older ball that is easier to score runs against, they must aim to make a large number of runs. They may be exposed to the new ball if an opener loses his wicket early on and so must be equipped to deal with this scenario as well. Top and middle order batsmen must also be adaptable as they may be required to attack, consolidate or defend according to the needs of the team as the match situation develops. The world's most prolific and best recognised batsmen are generally found in the top order.\n\nThe middle order is typically defined as the batsmen batting at positions 4, 5, 6 and 7. It usually consists of versatile batters who must continue to build an innings. The middle order batter is likely to be facing a much older ball bowled by a spin bowler and defensive technique is necessary to overcome this type of attack, but they are often also fleet-footed players who attack slow bowling by charging down the pitch. The middle order players must also be adept at making runs when playing with the poor quality batters in the lower order. This requires the ability to manipulate the strike so that the tail-enders are shielded from the more potent bowlers. \n\nPlayers who are designated as all-rounders often bat in the middle order (e.g., Garfield Sobers usually batted at number 6; by contrast, W. G. Grace always opened the innings). Wicketkeepers generally bat in the middle order as well, often at number 6 or 7 (e.g. Adam Gilchrist early in his career). One reason for placing all-rounders and wicket-keepers in the middle-order even though they may be more skilled than those who batted above them was because such players would be tired after bowling or keeping wicket during the preceding innings. Another reason, with the trend of wicketkeepers opening the innings in limited-over cricket, batsmen at positions 6, 7 and 8 tend to be at the crease when the first or second new ball is due, so they can function just like an opener and know how to wear out the new ball, or play aggressively to score quick runs to chase victory or to build the innings quickly towards a declaration. It is also plausible to see substitute wicketkeepers at 5.\n\nIn One Day International cricket, middle order batters are generally able to change their game depending on the conditions. If their team loses wickets early, they must be able to play a long careful innings. Conversely, if they are not required to bat until later in the game, they must be able to attempt to score quickly, often attempting to hit many fours or sixes, and if they only have a short period to bat, they are expected to be innovative and able to settle after a short period. In run-chases they are required to be good at calculating and minimising the risks needed to reach the target, by scoring at close to the rate required. If they score more quickly than is required, they run the risk of getting out and exposing the weaker, lower-order batsmen to the pressure situation, but if they score too slowly, then they fall behind schedule and the pressure again increases.\n\nThe lower order is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 8, 9, 10 and 11. It is usually made up of players who have average or poor batting skills, commonly known as tailenders (tail ender or tail-ender). These players are the team's specialist bowlers and sometimes the wicketkeeper, or even players on debut if their batting abilities are unproven because bowlers with better batting abilities, aspiring all-rounders or wicketkeepers do have a chance to move up the order over the course of their careers (notably Steve Smith moved from 8 to 3–5, and Ashton Agar moved from 11 to 7 in first-class cricket). However, some bowlers do establish themselves as competent lower order batters, especially at no. 8 where many bowlers become bowling all-rounders, as in the case of fast bowlers Wasim Akram and Jason Holder who, both, have a double Test century each to their names. By the same token, opening batters could move down the order due to poor form, having a top-heavy line-up or being better suited to play against spin bowling (notably Moeen Ali moving down from an opener to no. 7, or even 8, since 2015 Ashes series, but has since also played at 3 in 2018). Therefore, the start of the lower order may vary in position depending on the balance of the side in terms of overall batting capability. Also, given that batters in ODIs and Twenty20 need to score quickly and aggressively, an opener in limited-over forms of the game may bat down the order in tests.\n\nIt is likely that these batters will be dismissed for low scores. However, as expectations of these players are low when they are batting, they often play aggressive, carefree shots in the hope of scoring as many runs as possible. On occasion, the scores posted by the lower order have made a difference to the outcome of a match. If a significant contribution has come from the tail-enders, it is often said that \"the tail wagged\".\n\nOn occasions in which the batting team is a long way behind its opponents, the lower-order batters may attempt to salvage a draw by playing defensively until the end of the match. An example of this would be the first test in the 2009 Ashes series, in which England bowlers James Anderson and Monty Panesar were able to remain at the crease for 11.3 overs, denying Australia the chance to win the match.\n\nThe last batter in the order (at position 11) is sometimes referred to as \"Last Man Jack\", a term that has passed into everyday parlance. This is because if the batting order were arranged as a pack of cards numbers 9 and 10 would be followed by Jack. Those batters who bat at positions 7, 8, and 9 are also known as middle–lower order batters.\n\nSource:\n\n\nSource:\nNitschke's score of 81 and Smith's 42 in the 2005 Women's Ashes in a partnership of 139 is the highest last wicket partnership in women's test cricket.\n"}

It is a companion to the \"Angel\" episode \"Darla\", which aired later on the same night on The WB network; both episodes include multiple flashbacks to the history of Spike and Darla, shown from their respective viewpoints.\n\nAfter a common vampire nearly kills her with her own stake, Buffy turns to Spike to learn how other Slayers met their end so as not to make further mistakes.\n\nBuffy receives a serious stab wound while fighting a run-of-the-mill vampire at the cemetery; she is saved only by the unexpected arrival of Riley. Despite his encouragement that she is not losing her edge, Buffy wants to research ways to avoid making more mistakes. She and Giles start looking in the Watcher diaries for information about past Slayers' deaths, but Giles tells her there won't be much information because the Watchers usually also died or found it too painful to recount the incidents. Buffy then remembers they have another witness to Slayers' final battles: Spike.\n\nBuffy drags Spike from his crypt, takes him to the Bronze and pays him to tell her about his battles with the two Slayers that he killed. He starts out by describing how he was turned in 1880 London, revealing (to the audience, if not entirely to Buffy) that he was the meek poet William, ridiculed by his peers and rejected by the love of his life, Cecily, who declared him \"beneath her,\" before Drusilla sired him and took him with her to travel Europe with her sire Angelus (Angel sans soul) and his sire/paramour Darla.\n\nSpike further describes how, mere months later, he became far more assertive, already using his new name \"Spike,\" speaking in a more forceful, working class accent, and preying upon innocents not for sustenance but for fun, calling too much attention to the group as far as Angelus was concerned. Angelus preferred meticulous, artistic kills, and Spike's love of brawls and riots required them to flee London. Spike mocked Angelus' attitude, and the older vampire lost control, almost staking him, but Spike only laughed at having provoked Angelus to such an extent. Infuriated, Angelus remarked that maybe one day an angry crowd would teach Spike the folly of his excesses, adding \"That...or the Slayer,\" a comment which instantly intrigued Spike. In the present, Spike reveals that, upon learning of the Slayer, he became obsessed with her; unlike other vampires, who feared the Slayer, Spike actively sought her out, craving the challenge she would provide.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley, Xander, Willow and Anya take over Buffy's patrol. Riley is very methodical, but the rest of the Scoobies are rather lax about the process. They do discover a nest of vampires, including the one that injured Buffy. They make plans to destroy it the next day when the vampires won't be active.\n\nBack at the Bronze, Spike tells of killing the Chinese Slayer during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, defeating her after a long and brutal fight, describing her as \"all business\" and getting nostalgic about how Drusilla was excited afterward, calling the event \"\"the best night of my life\"\" (much to Buffy's disgust). Spike also points out that while the Slayer can kill thousands of demons and vampires, all it takes to kill her is for one of them to have one lucky day.\n\nRiley, rather than waiting for daylight, goes back to the vampire lair at night, stakes the vampire who wounded Buffy and then firebombs the crypt, killing the others.\n\nSpike's reminiscences continue as he discusses his second Slayer kill (Nikki Wood), whom he describes as more improvisational like Buffy, and whom he killed on a New York City subway about 1977. After he finishes, he reveals that he won by exploiting the Slayers' curiosity about – and wish for – death, further claiming that every Slayer has a death wish, including Buffy herself. Buffy rejects his conclusion and becomes angry and disgusted when Spike comes on to her, trying to kiss her and challenging her to prove him wrong. Knocking him to the ground, Buffy, echoing Cecily, contemptuously informs Spike that he is \"beneath her\" before walking away. Spike's feelings of sadness and humiliation, which cause him to briefly succumb to tears, are quickly overtaken by anger and frustration. He arms himself with a double-barreled shotgun at his crypt, determined to kill Buffy for this insult.\n\nWhen she gets home, her mother reveals that she needs to go into the hospital for some more tests, and that her condition may be serious. Unable to bear this information, Buffy retreats to the back porch in tears. At that moment, Spike approaches with his shotgun, but Buffy's distraught state changes his mind and he attempts to comfort her instead. He takes a seat next to her and gently pats her on the back, an action that Buffy does not rebuff, though her shock is clear.\n\n"}

Her musical style is eclectic and often blends elements of afrobeat, art rock, post-punk, classical, new-wave and electronic. Her debut album \"Bone of My Bones\" was released to positive reviews in 2009. Recorded in India, her second album, \"Behold, a Pale Horse\" was released in September 2013, to critical acclaim.\nHer third album \"Nephilim\" went out in 2018.\n\nEbony Bones was named by her original drummer Rat Scabies, of band The Damned. Known for her on-stage antics and theatrical costumes, she opened for Cee Lo Green's 2011 Tour across the UK and Europe. Beginning as a self-taught musician performing under the stage name 'Ebony Bones!', she anonymously uploaded music onto a blank Myspace page. Scabies encouraged her to also produce her own records : \"I was very determined to carve out my own sound and not kind of have the pressure of someone else dictating to me what that should be\".\n\nWriting and producing her own material, \"We Know All About U\", depicting an Orwellian society, made its radio début as \"The Hottest Record in the World Today\" as well as \"Single of the Week\" on BBC Radio 1 by DJ Zane Lowe, also receiving daytime play from Jo Whiley, becoming Radio 1's most played single by an unsigned artist. Her début album \"Bone of My Bones\" was released in 2009 and hailed by critics. It included the tracks \"W.A.R.R.I.O.R\" and \"Guess We'll Always Have NY\", later used for campaigns by Yves Saint Laurent, EA Sports \"FIFA 11\" soundtrack, and a controversial Citroën car commercial featuring John Lennon, which was later banned in parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2010 she was requested to perform live at the Shanghai World Trade Show Expo 2010, Central Park SummerStage in New York, and The Grand Palais in Paris for SFR live concerts. In the summer of 2011 Ebony Bones also debuted new material from her second album at The Cannes Film Festival and T-Mobile International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2013, Bones released her second album \"Behold, A Pale Horse\": it was partly conceived while travelling in India. The record featured the Symphony Orchestra of India and a cover of The Smiths. \"Behold, A Pale Horse\" was critically acclaimed and received good reviews by the likes of \"The Independent\", and \"Spin\". Bones decided to create and run her own label, titled \"1984 Records\". She has released a majority of her works on this album, such as her EP titled \"Bread & Circus Pt. 1\".

First described in the later nineteenth century, the only other species are known from fossil specimens. They are similar in appearance to potoroos and bettongs, but are not as closely related. Their omnivorous diet is known to include materials such as fruit and fungi, as well as small animals such as insects and other invertebrates. The local Aboriginal name for the species is durrgim yuri\".\"\n\nThe description of this species, assigned to a new genus \"Hypsiprymnodon\", was published in 1876 by Edward Pierson Ramsay, a curator at the Australian Museum. The syntypes are part of the museum's collection, mounted specimens of a male and female collected at Rockingham Bay, Queensland. Ramsay's specimens were obtained during European settlement of north-eastern Australia on an expedition toward the Herbert River. A description of the species was provided by Richard Owen in the year after Ramsay's publication, the name \"Pleopus nudicaudatus\" describing the five toes of the hind foot and its scaly naked tail and is now regarded as a synonym. Ramsay had provisionally assigned the species to the genus \"Hypsiprymnus\", but in his review of the dentition he proposed to separate them to a new genus.\n\"Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\" has been placed with subfamily Hypsiprymnodontinae of the family Potoroidae, the most recent classification places it in the family Hypsiprymnodontidae with prehistoric taxa.\n\nThe specific epithet is derived from Latin term \"moschatus\" meaning musky. The description as a new species of 'rat-kangaroo' was the last of the nineteenth century, bringing the total to nine species, and no other new species would be formally described for another ninety years.\n\n\"Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\" is the smallest species of the macropod order, weighing around 500 grams. \nThe total length of the head and body is 155 to 270 millimetres, the weight range 360 to 680 grams.\nSexual dimorphism is not readily apparent in this species, although the females may be slightly larger.\nThey have a long black tail, measuring from 125 to 160 mm. \nThe appearance of the tail is scaly, rather than hairy, and proportionally shorter than the length of the head and body. \nTheir ears are also nearly hairless and appear leathery.\nThe pelage is a uniform, deep and rich brown colour with reddish highlights over most of the body, the head and lower parts are somewhat greyish. \nThe dark and chocolatey colour of the fur distinguish them from the other living 'rat-kangaroos'.\nA steel grey colour at the head grades into the rich brown of the body.\nThe feet of \"H. moschatus\" are blackish and, uniquely among the macropods, have five toes at the hind foot.\nA band of white, variously slight to distinct, appears from the belly toward the throat.\nThe animal emits a noticeable musky odour.\n\nDentition of the species resembles that of the extant potoroids, but for that family's incisor formula of I3/1. \nThe dental formula of \"Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\" is I3/2 C1/0 PM1/1 M4/4. Two premolars found in juveniles are replaced at maturity when a single sectorial premolar erupts. \nThe sequence of emerging molars and premolars allows the age of the individual to be determined. \n\"Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\" have a fine and delicate skull structure with a rostrum that is narrow and elongate. A long nasal bone structure and distance between the canine and premolar teeth is large.\n\nThe species only occurs in the north-east of the continent. They may be locally common in remaining areas of extensive rainforest and can occur at high and low elevations. The distribution range extends from west of Ingham, Queensland at Mt Lee to Mt Amos south of Cooktown. They are found in low altitude rainforests, such as Cape Tribulation and Mission Beach, and within the montane habitat of the Carbine, Atherton and Windsor tableland regions. The population density of the \"H. moschatus\" is from 1.40 to 4.50 animals per hectare.\n\nA usually solitary animal that is only active during the day, distinguishing them from the nocturnal habits of the rat-kangaroos in the Potoroidae family. They are most active in the morning and afternoon, retiring to their shelter during the middle of the day. They are mostly terrestrial, foraging at the forest floor, although they are able to move through the branches of the lower vegetation.\n\nA nest is roughly constructed at a site where the animal shelters while sleeping.\nObservations of the behaviour within its dense habitat presented difficulties to early field work, however, the use of a thread, lightly glued to the animal and fed from a spool, allowed the activity and range of males and females to be more accurately evaluated.\nThe individual ranges overlap in both their both foraging and nest site. \nMales may venture out in a range from 0.8 to 4.2 hectares, while females are recorded foraging over a smaller sized area of up to 2.2 ha.\nAlthough they are usually solitary in the activities, several may gather to feed at fallen fruit.\n\nTheir omnivorous diet comprises fruits and fungi along with some insects and other invertebrates, found among the leaf litter and lower storey of the rainforest. The composition of the diet has been described as omnivorous, perhaps with reduced capacity for the carnivory of some fossil species of propleonines, but other records suggest the diet is largely frugivorous.\n\nAggressive behaviours between males may be displayed during the austral spring and summer months, vigorously pursuing each other for around thirty seconds. The male's encounters, sometimes in competition for fruit, increase in frequency during breeding months; physical interactions between the males are restricted to striking with the front paw.\nReproductive activity is mostly from October to April, the usual litter size is two offspring. The newborn travels in the pouch of the mother for about 21 weeks, and then left at the nest while the mother forages until the juvenile is fully weaned.\nThe earliest records note that the animal was elusive and discrete in its nature, and that specimens were difficult to obtain.\n\nRegular activity is conducted on all four limbs, but unlike the bettongs and potoroos, the musky rat-kangaroo bounds using all its paws when moving rapidly.\nThis resembles the characteristic hopping of a rabbit more than that of its macropod relations.\nIt moves by extending its body and then bringing both of its hind legs forward, and uses an opposable toe on the hind foot to climb trees.\n\nA number of parasitic species are presumed to be associated with \"H. moschatus\", including internal organisms such as roundworm and tapeworm species and ectoparasites such as ticks, mites, lice and fleas; the identified species of mite (Acari) are those of genera \"Mesolaelaps\" and \"Trichosurolaelaps\".\n\nMusky rat-kangaroos have been protected from many of the threatening factors that greatly reduced the potoroine species, and their rainforest habitat has in part remain secluded and conserved. The species remains vulnerable to fragmentation of the population by land clearing, which disrupts the ability to recolonise and increases genetic isolation, Their role in seed dispersal within their range is likewise important to the ecology of their tropical rainforest habitat.\nBy carrying a fleshy fruit away to be consumed, or pressing them into earth as a cache, \"Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\" gives advantage to the plant's potential for recruitment. This interaction between plants and mammal has been compared to those on other continents, such as the squirrels and agoutis, and posited as an example convergent evolution.\n\nThe lack of size difference in the sexes corresponds to a limited home range for males, the inability to range beyond the female also allows greater attention to sexual competitors. The high level of overlaps in range of a local populous allows high population densities.\n\nAfter the first description of the species, the rat was allied to various familial relationships. Later revisions have strongly indicated deep divergence from the extant potoroid marsupials, \"Bettongia\" and \"Potorous\", and separated at the family level as Hypsiprymnodontidae. The discovery of fossil specimens has revealed a more widespread and diverse lineage in Miocene Australia. The placement may be summarised as,\n\n"}

That Act had been superseded by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which over the next two decades was itself significantly amended to increase police powers of arrest, relating in particular to entry, search following arrest and to custody. In England and Wales, the category \"arrestable offence\" ceased to exist with the advent on 1 January 2006 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act. In Northern Ireland, it ceased to exist with the advent of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.

When he moved to Paris, he had the good fortune to attract the attention of renowned surgeons Antoine Louis (1723–1792) and Pierre-Joseph Desault (1744–1795). Boyer persevered at his profession, and became notorious for his anatomical knowledge and surgical dexterity. At the age of 37 he was appointed second surgeon to the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris. On the establishment of the École de Sante, he was named chair of operative surgery, but soon exchanged it for the chair of clinical surgery. Boyer specialized in urological pathology, especially disorders of micturition.\n\nBoyer was a cautious and finicky physician, not always trusting of new innovations in treatment. He practiced and wrote with skill and sense. His two masterworks are ' (in 4 vols., 1797–1799), of which a fourth edition appeared in 1815, and ' (in 2 vols., 1814–1826), of which a newer edition in seven volumes was published in 1844–1853 with additions by his son, Philippe Boyer (1801–1858).\n\nIn 1805, Napoleon promoted Boyer to the status of imperial family surgeon, and, after the successful campaigns of 1806 and 1807, conferred on him the Legion of Honor, with the title of baron of the empire and a salary of 25,000 francs. On the fall of Napoleon, Boyer's merits secured him the favor of the succeeding sovereigns of France, and he was consulting surgeon to Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis Philippe. In 1825 Boyer succeeded J. F. L. Deschamps (1740–1824) as surgeon-in-chief at Hôpital de la Charité, and was chosen a member of the Institute. He died in Paris in 1833.\n"}

She practices a handstand on a block of wood, but falls when her sister, Dawn, knocks over the crystals. In the morning, Dawn continues annoying Buffy by emptying the milk carton. Joyce asks Buffy to take Dawn shopping for school supplies, but Riley reminds her they had already made plans. Buffy has to cancel so she can go work with Giles.\n\nGiles drives the sisters on their errands, having trouble with the automatic transmission in his new BMW convertible. They spot Willow and Tara heading for the magic shop, and Buffy tells Willow that she's dropping Drama in favor of more slayer training. At the shop, the gang finds the owner dead, killed by vampires. Buffy sends Dawn outside where she encounters a deranged man. He seems to recognize her, saying, \"You don't belong here.\" She is upset until Tara comes to keep her company.\n\nThe gang realizes that a pack of vampires raided the shop for books on how to defeat the Slayer, under Harmony's leadership. Giles admires the shop and its potential for a future business.\n\nThat night, Dawn is happy to have Xander as her babysitter, until she discovers Anya is coming too. Harmony arrives to challenge Buffy but is disappointed when she's not there. Xander taunts Harmony and her minions from the safety of the house until Dawn mistakenly invites the vampire inside. After Harmony puts up a fight, Xander kicks her out of the house. Harmony later encounters Spike in the graveyard, and the two talk about Harmony's plans to kill the Slayer. While unpacking in their new place, Tara and Willow discuss how Dawn is having a hard time as the outsider of the Scooby Gang. Tara reveals that she has similar feelings as an outsider.\n\nOn patrol, Buffy is fuming about the lecture she received from her mother about allowing Dawn to see a dead body. Riley tries to talk some sense into her, pointing out she and Dawn resent each other for similar reasons. When they return home, Xander tells Buffy about Harmony and - after the Slayer stops laughing - she gets angry that Dawn invited Harmony inside. Buffy complains to Riley and Xander about the trouble Dawn causes and how she can't always be there to protect her; Dawn listens from the hall and runs outside in tears. Before Anya can bring Dawn back inside, Harmony's vampire minions capture Dawn and attack Anya causing her to be hospitalized. Buffy then runs out to find her sister leaving Xander and Riley to take care of Anya.\n\nHarmony explains to her minions that Dawn is bait, meaning they can't eat her. Harmony complains to Dawn about her problems until her mutinous minions attempt to kill them both. Buffy - who had threatened Spike until he revealed Harmony's location - arrives and easily kills most of the minions as Harmony escapes. The Slayer frees her sister and when they get home, they agree not to tell their mother. The next day, Buffy and Giles talk about his decision to take over the magic shop, while Dawn writes in her journal that Buffy still thinks she's a nobody, but she's going to be in for a surprise.\n\nWhen casting the role of Dawn, Sarah Michelle Gellar suggested they take a look at Michelle Trachtenberg. Dawn was originally conceived to be 12 years old, but after casting Trachtenberg, the writers raised the character's age to 14. However, the first few scripts were still written in the voice of a 12-year-old. Before being cast, Trachtenberg, a fan of the show, had written a letter to Joss Whedon that suggested how she could become a character on \"Buffy\".\n\nWriter David Fury says he was \"given a lot of freedom to develop Dawn\" as her background was completely unknown. He set up her relationships with other characters, such as Willow's status as Dawn's \"Favorite Aunt\", and provided additional backstory that—although not necessarily appearing in the finished script—\"infused her character in future episodes.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

TheCharleston Coliseum & Convention Center currently consists of three main components: the Civic Center Coliseum, the Little Theater, and the Charleston Convention Center, also referred to as the Grand Hall.\n\nIn 1953, the first in a series of general obligation bonds was approved by city voters for the construction of a civic center in the downtown area of Charleston, West Virginia between Lee Street and Quarrier Street on the banks of the Elk River just before the Elk River empties into the Kanawha River. When the original Civic Center opened in January 1959 at the cost of $2.5 million, it consisted of a 6,000-seat arena and the 750-seat \"Little Theater.\"\n\nThe Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center underwent its first renovation and expansion in 1964 when 2,400 additional seats were added to the arena and a paved parking lot and an ice rink were added to the facilities. The $1.5 million project was financed through the sale of revenue bonds.\n\nThe most significant renovation and expansion began when city voters approved a $10 million general obligation bond sale in 1976 to erect a 13,000-seat coliseum, a two-story lobby that connected the new coliseum with the original arena and theater, and remodel the original arena into a convention center. The project also received an additional $10 million in federal matching grants and was completed in 1980.\n\nTwo parking garages were added in 1983, accommodating up to 1,300 cars. In 1994, the Grand Hall of the convention center received a new ceiling, paint and lighting and the ice rink was also converted into an exhibit hall in the 2001. The last renovations took place between 2004 and 2006 when about $250,000 was spent to renovate the Little Theater.\n\nAfter Pride Youth Programs' annual anti-drug convention in early 2007, Jay DeWispelaere, CEO of Pride Youth Programs, commented on what he felt were the inadequacies of the Charleston Civic Center. In May 2015, the Charleston's Municipal Planning Commission approved the permit need to move forward with a planned comprehensive expansion and renovation, expected to cost around $72 million. Construction began in September 2015, with an expected completion date in early 2018. The Civic Center will remain open during construction.\n\nAs part of a 10-year sponsorship deal with the organization, the Charleston Civic Center's new basketball court (which debuted in the 2011-12 season) is branded with a large logo for Friends of Coal, a locally based political advocacy group.\n\nThe Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center is a venue for a number of annual events and fairs throughout the year. Among the events includes Annual West Virginia Hunting and Fishing Show, West Virginia Association of Fairs & Festivals Conference, West Virginia International Auto Show, West Virginia Sports Show, the Taste of Charleston, and the Capital City Art & Craft Show. Several local high schools hold their proms and graduation ceremonies at the Civic Center. The Civic Center has also hosted local show choir festivals, including the state competition.\n\nThe Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center also hosts the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals of the annual Mountain East Conference postseason tournament, West Virginia State High School Boys and Girls Basketball Tournaments, music concerts, professional wrestling, and hosted basketball games between in-state rivals West Virginia University and Marshall University until that series ended in 2016.

It has spread throughout southern Europe both as a weed and cultivated as a garden plant. It has been introduced to the United States as an ornamental where it has become naturalized as a weed of cropland and vacant land, particularly on disturbed ground.\n\nThe plant grows to a height of , sometimes exceeding , and has white or yellow flowers with a purple centre. In the deeply pigmented centre of the flower, the surface features striations, which have been the subject of controversy about whether they act as a diffraction grating, creating iridescence. \n\nThe pollinated but unripe seedpods look like oriental paper lanterns, less than an inch across, pale green with purple highlights.\n\nThe flowers of the \"Hibiscus trionum\" can set seed via both outcrossing and self-pollination. During the first few hours after anthesis, the style and stigma are erect and receptive to receive pollen from other plants. In the absence of pollen donation, the style bends and makes contact with the anthers of the same flower, inducing self-pollination. Although outcrossing plants seem to perform better than self-pollinating plants, this form of reproductive assurance might have contributed to the success of \"H. trionum\" plants in several environments.\n\nInitial studies showed that artificial replicas of the flower surface produced iridescence that bees could recognise. Later work suggested that the irregularities of the plant cells and surface resulted in the periodicity of the striations being too irregular to create clear iridescence and thus suggested that the iridescence is not visible to man and flower visiting insects. More recent papers have presented evidence that the flower is both visibly and measurably iridescent, and the striations have been shown to be sufficiently irregular to generate particularly strong scattering of light at short wavelengths, producing weak iridescence and a 'blue halo' (of which the halo is the dominant visible effect). It has also been demonstrated that the blue scattering increases the foraging efficiency of bumblebees in laboratory environments, although it remains unknown whether this effect translates to a meaningful advantage in the field.\n\n\n"}

He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Alfred Hitchcock in \"The Girl\" (2012) and won a Best Male Comedy BAFTA for his role in \"Detectorists\" (2018). In 2017, he portrayed Culverton Smith in \"The Lying Detective\", an episode of the BBC crime drama \"Sherlock\".\n\nJones was born in Hammersmith, London, to actors Jennifer Jones (née Heslewood) and Freddie Jones. He has two brothers: Rupert, a director, and Casper, also an actor. He attended Christ Church Cathedral School and Abingdon School in Oxfordshire in the 1980s. He studied drama at the University of Manchester from 1986 to 1989, and at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris from 1989 to 1991.\n\nJones has appeared in more than 20 films since his first acting role in the 1992 film \"Orlando\". He voiced Dobby in two \"Harry Potter\" films: \"Chamber of Secrets\" (2002) and \"The Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" (2010).

Discussing working with Jones on \"Capital\", writer Peter Bowker said, \"I think Toby is a genius and thought that long before I worked with him. He always wants to know a character's needs, and what's beneath those needs. Then he takes all that material and somehow embeds it into the character and physically inhabits the character, so that you never think he's playing the character. It's fascinating to watch him close up. He carries the emotional complexities in every tiny gesture that his character makes so that you immediately can see what his character is like. A character like Roger is full of contradictions, a city banker with an air of entitlement but also a little insecurity picking away at him. Toby can portray that in his walk alone. That's what's great about him, he can portray cold he can portray warm and he can portray both of those things at once.\"\n\nHe plays Captain Mainwaring in the film \"Dad's Army\", released in February 2016. In July the same year he starred as the eponymous agent Verloc in the BBC's \"The Secret Agent\", a 3-part television adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel.\n\nIn 2017, he portrayed Culverton Smith in \"The Lying Detective\", an episode of the BBC crime drama \"Sherlock\".

The company was also known for Elia Kazan's films that he directed from 1945 to 1976.\n\nAround the time that the joint venture with Columbia Pictures Entertainment ended in 1988, LBS began to lose money, and in December 1991, LBS filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a result, the company ended up having to sell between 80 and 85 percent of its assets to its \"Baywatch\" distributor partner, the Scotti Brothers' All American Television. In 1997, All American was sold to Pearson plc, and was re-branded as Pearson Television. Pearson Television later merged with CLT-UFA to form RTL Group and Pearson Television was renamed to FremantleMedia. As of today, most of LBS' library is owned by FremantleMedia with some exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298903", "title": "Autoloader", "text": "Autoloader\n\nIn armored warfare, an autoloader or auto-loader is a mechanical aid or replacement for the personnel that load ordnance into crew-served weapons, such as tanks and artillery. The term is generally only applied to larger weapons that would otherwise have a dedicated person or persons loading them.\n\nAn autoloader, as its name suggests, extracts a shell and propellant charge from the ammunition storage rack/compartment and loads it into a magazine, if the gun has one, or directly into the chamber of the gun if it does not. It can and often does replace a human loader. By automating the loading process, it can streamline and speed up the loading process, resulting in a more effective fighting machine. In addition, by removing the need for one (or more) crew member, the overall size of the vehicle can be reduced, which in turn reduces the amount of surface area that needs to be armored, and thus a vehicle designed to use an autoloader can benefit from a significant decrease in weight and size. Also, because an autoloader can take up less volume inside a tank than a human, it potentially allows for a lower profile, making the tank harder to hit. Autoloaders are mechanical devices, and therefore their reliability depends on how well they are designed, manufactured, and maintained.\n\nAutoloaders were developed at the beginning of World War II. Their first combat use was in \"tank-buster\" aircraft such as the 75 mm caliber \"Bordkanone\" BK 7,5 cannon-equipped Henschel Hs 129 B-3. Every Soviet- and Russian-derived tank since the T-64 main battle tank has used an autoloader. Their use has been mostly shunned by American and British tanks, despite the American T22E1 medium tank being one of the first tank designs to use an autoloader.\n\nIn the modern era, autoloading is common on any large (76.2 mm caliber or greater) naval gun. The size of the shells, when combined with the more elaborate autoloading facilities available in the wider spaces of a ship, makes an autoloader much faster than human loaders. For example, the US 5\"/38 Mark 12 can load about 20 rounds per minute.\n\nThe Soviet/Russian AK-130 (twin barrel 130 mm), using autoloading, can achieve up to 40 rounds per barrel per minute.\n\nThe Italian 127 mm/5\" Compact has similar performance. The largest caliber auto-loading naval rifles were the US 8\"/55 Mark 16, deployed on the three cruisers of the Des Moines class in the late 1940s, and the 8\"/55 Mark 71 tested aboard the destroyer USS \"Hull\" in the late 1970s. Both weapons achieved a rate of fire of 12 rounds per barrel per minute, compared to 3-4 rounds per minute for the preceding hand-loaded weapons.\n\nThe advent of jet aircraft, and the rate of fire required to engage them, hastened the adoption of automatic loaders on naval artillery. Development of the loading systems was often problematic, and reliability was seriously compromised in many cases. The US 5\"/54 Mark 42 was derated from 40 rounds per minute to 34 to improve reliability. The Soviet/Russian AK-130 was so badly delayed that the missile cruiser Kirov (later \"Admiral Ushakov\") was forced to use two older weapons in its place. The US 3\"/70 Mark 37 actually spent more time in design (13 years) than in service (12 years) due to severe unreliability. These problems are largely of the past and the field has advanced a great deal.\n\nA modern autoloader for a 120–125 mm caliber weapon in good condition can achieve about 10–12 rounds per minute. This rating may or may not include the time required to bring the gun to the appropriate loading angle (if required) and then bringing it back up to firing angle after loading. The autoloader on the cancelled Object 640 \"Black Eagle\" tank was supposed to have up to 15 rounds per minute rate of fire.\n\nIt is considered atypical to engage more than a few targets per minute in a tank. The autoloader may also have an advantage while travelling over rough terrain that may jar a human loader enough to disrupt his loading cycle.\n\nFor weapons above 127 mm, the increased weight of the round pushes this issue decisively in favor of the autoloader. For self-propelled artillery with calibers of around 152–155mm, for example, autoloaders can typically achieve 8–12 rounds per minute, while a human loader(s) can typically achieve 4 rounds per minute. For sustained bombardments, this may not be so important. Sustained firing rates for artillery are typically only 1–2 rounds per minute, but the rapid-fire capability is vital to shoot-and-scoot tactics to deliver enough fire and then avoid the rapid counterbattery response provided by modern counterbattery systems. On the other hand, even during sustained bombardment an autoloader could be useful, as the fatigue issues of loading an artillery piece for hours (a 155mm projectile weighs ca. 50 kg) do not affect them.\n\nIn addition an artillery with an autoloader and powerful fire control system can utilise \"Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact\" technique, which allows to burst fire several shells, varying their propellant charges so all of them land on target simultaneously.\n\nThe most common autoloaders store their ammunition in the turret basket, increasing the possibility of a catastrophic explosion should the armor around the hull or turret be penetrated. More armor protection, and isolation/separation of the ammunition from the crew compartment has traditionally been available in tanks with a human loader, which can decrease the possibility of cook-off, or protect the crew in case of an ammunition explosion.\n\nFor example, the M1 Abrams was designed to protect the crew from cook-off, which is accomplished by storing the main gun ammunition in a compartment at the rear of the turret. The compartment is separated from the crew by a power-operated armored door, which is only opened for a couple of seconds each time the loader needs to grab another round. The top of the compartment has special roof panels that are armored against outside attack but are much less resistant to pressure from inside, so that if the compartment is penetrated by enemy fire the panels will vent the explosion generated by the ammunition while protecting the crew. Other western designs from the later Cold War era to the present with manual loading have similar protective features. In contrast, the Soviet tanks of the Cold War which employ autoloaders store the ammunition on a carousel in the middle of the crew compartment, where any penetration by enemy fire is likely to incinerate the crew and blow the turret right off the top of the tank (known as the jack-in-the-box effect).\n\nHowever, some newer autoloader designs also store the ammunition in an isolated compartment in the turret bustle, with blowout panels on top and the ramming mechanism underneath or in the middle. This allows for much better crew protection, but is disadvantaged because the loading mechanism located in the ammunition compartment reduces the available space and number of rounds that can be carried considerably compared to a similar sized compartment without machinery. With such a design, the loader crew member can be eliminated, but only half the ammunition can be carried ready, in the compartment with the autoloader. Therefore, such a tank usually stores additional ammo in compartmentalized storage at the bottom of the fighting compartment, like older manual loading tank designs. This storage can be surrounded by water, and compartmentalized to some extent, but the reduced crew must still transfer this ammunition to the autoloader at some point. However, such a design can also allow for the rapid replacement of the autoloader and reloading of the ready ammunition by making the compartment at the rear of the turret a modular component that can be easily replaced with appropriate support equipment, similar to how the US MLRS system is reloaded, but possibly even faster. Another possible advantage is that the door that separates the turret can only be large enough for one round of ammunition to slide through, rather than extending across the entire rear of the turret as in the case of the M1 Abrams - this could save additional mass and reduce the power necessary to operate the door, by using less massive armor for the same level of protection, since it would be part of the turret instead of a sliding component in a heavy frame.\n\nThe disadvantage of the need to keep most of the ammunition close to the autoloader can be actually turned into an advantage by using an unmanned turret design with a crew capsule. In this case, all the necessary ammunition can be kept in direct access to the autoloader, without affecting the safety of the crew, because the crew compartment is completely separate from the autoloader and ammunition. Modern examples of this design are the Russian T-14 \"Armata\" MBT and the Polish PL-01 light tank.\n\nAutoloaders are often implemented in an attempt to save on tank size. The T-64 is an example of this. The current generation of tanks using autoloaders (Russian T-90 and T-14, Japanese Type 90 and Type 10, Chinese Type 98, Korean K2 Black Panther, French Leclerc, Chinese/Pakistani Al-Khalid MBT) all weigh between 45–55 tons. Tanks that do not use autoloaders tend to weigh in the 55–70 ton range (American M1A2 Abrams, German Leopard 2, Indian Arjun, British Challenger 2).\n\nThe replacement of the loader and gunner with a commander and driver could allow crewmembers to rotate shifts. This would enable continuous operations on the battlefield. Though in some retrofit cases (Abrams tank for example) there is nothing in the fitting of an autoloader that requires the removal of the loader. In such situations the autoloader frees up the fourth crew-member to support the other three full-time, instead of just part-time when they are not doing their main job.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298910", "title": "Aria (manga)", "text": "Aria (manga)\n\nADV Manga released English translations of the first three volumes of \"Aria\" in 2004, before dropping the license. Tokyopop then acquired the English-language rights to \"Aqua\" as well as \"Aria\". Tokyopop released the two volumes of \"Aqua\" on October 2007 and February 2008, and six volumes of \"Aria\" between January 2008 and December 2010. The anime is licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International, which released all three seasons a box sets under its Nozomi Entertainment imprint between 30 September 2008 and 2 March 2010.\n\nThe series is set in the 24th century on a terraformed Mars, now named Aqua, and follows a young woman named Akari Mizunashi as she trains as an apprentice gondolier (known as Undines). The series has been praised for its calm pacing, optimistic worldview, beautiful art, and, for the anime, the quality of the soundtrack.\n\n\"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" take place in the early 24th century, starting in 2301 AD, in the city of Neo-Venezia (ネオ・ヴェネツィア \"Neo Venetsia\", literally \"New Venice\") on the planet Aqua (アクア \"Akua\", formerly Mars, sometimes stylized as in the manga with the base text for \"Mars\" serving as a gloss), which was renamed after being terraformed into a habitable planet covered in oceans around 150 years beforehand. Neo-Venezia, based on Venice in both architecture and atmosphere, is a harbor city of narrow canals instead of streets, traveled by unmotorized gondolas.\n\nAt the start of \"Aqua\", a young woman named Akari arrives from Manhome (マンホーム \"Manhōmu\", formerly Earth, sometimes stylized as with the base text for \"Earth\" serving as a gloss) to become a trainee gondolier with Aria Company, one of the three most prestigious water-guide companies in the city. Her dream is to become an undine, a gondolier who acts as a tour guide (see \"Terms\" below). As she trains, Akari befriends her mentor Alicia, trainees and seniors from rival companies – Aika, Alice, Akira and Athena and others in the Neo-Venezia city. \"Aqua\" covers Akari's arrival on Aqua and her early training as a Pair, or apprentice, while \"Aria\" continues her training as a Single, or journeyman, culminating in the graduation of her, Aika, and Alice as full Prima undines.\n\nEach chapter is a slice of life episode of Akari's exploration of the worlds of gondoliering, Neo-Venezia, and Aqua itself. Amano frequently uses several pages of lush art to depict an environment, showing the wonder of both everyday activities as well as one-of-a-kind events. It has been described by reviewers as very similar in tone and effect to \"Yokohama Kaidashi Kikō\".\n\nAria Company is a very small water-guide company that starts with only two employees. Its uniforms are lined with blue, and its president (and namesake) is Aria Pokoteng.\n\nHimeya Company is the oldest and currently second-ranking water-guide company in Neo-Venezia. It employs 80 undines, with a uniform lined with red. Its president is Hime.\n\nOrange Planet is the largest water-guide company in Neo-Venezia, employing 81 undines (including 20 Primas). Its uniforms are lined with yellow, and its president is Maa.\n\nBecause blue-eyed cats are considered lucky on Aqua, all undine companies have a blue-eyed cat as a mascot, who is given the title President. Cats on Aqua have been bred to be as intelligent as humans, though they cannot speak.\n\n\nSeveral terms of the world of Aqua are derived from elemental mythology:\n\n\nAccording to her original afterword to \"Aqua\" volume 2, Kozue Amano's goal in writing the series was to have readers find happiness in small things and so not focus on their failures. In another afterword, she stated that writing \"Aria\" has forced her to pay attention to the four seasons and that she hopes the series shows her appreciation for them. Amano developed a 24 month calendar system for Aqua, based on Mars's real orbital period of 668.6 local days (see \"Timekeeping on Mars\"), making every season 6 months long; Amano marked the passage of time and the seasons throughout the series through such means as Akari explicitly telling her correspondent the time of year and depicting seasonal observances such as fireworks at the end of summer (\"Aqua\" volume 2, Navigation 9 and \"Aria\" volume 4, Navigation 20), New Year's Eve (\"Aria\" volume 2, Navigation 9), or birthdays of characters (\"Aria\" volume 10, Navigation 46).\n\nIn the universe of \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\", Neo-Venezia's builders modeled it after the city of Venice before its demise in the 21st century, including counterparts to such public landmarks as the Piazza San Marco and the Bridge of Sighs. In creating Neo-Venezia, Amano also based some of the fictional locations of the series on real Venetian locations. Examples include:\n\nOther locations on Aqua that Amano based on real places include the Japanese shrine visited in \"Aria\" volume 1, based on Fushimi Inari-taisha near Kyoto.\n\nAs part of the preparations for first season of the anime adaptation, the production crew led by director Jun'ichi Satō made a trip to Venice for location research. As a result of filming the movements of gondoliers sculling, they had to redraw the animation of undines rowing in the first episodes to make it realistic. Satō said that seeing a gondolier use his paddle to toss a bottle out of the water inspired the scene in episode 11 of \"Aria the Animation\" where Alicia does the same with a ball, which was not in the manga. As part of the production company's commitment to adapting the manga faithfully and gesture of consideration toward the voice actors, they provided the collected volumes of \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" to date, rather than requiring them to purchase their own or giving stacks of photocopies.\n\nAccording to Jun'ichi Satō, it was a struggle to fit the available material into the 13 episodes of the first season, which focused closely on Akari. The title of the second season, \"Aria the Natural\", came about because he had 26 episodes to work with, letting him treat the story in a more \"natural\" manner, allowing the series to develop other characters more.\n\nChoro Club and Takeshi Senoo composed 30 works of music for the first season of the anime and 15 for the second. Jun'ichi Satō and sound designer Yasuno Satō assigned Choro Club and Takeshi Senoo abstract themes instead of plot points, which was an unfamiliar method for the composers, who did not have much experience working for anime shows. Takeshi Senoo and the three members of Choro Club make a cameo appearance as musicians in episode 23 of \"Aria the Natural\". Jun'ichi Satō has commented that the lyrics for the songs \"Barracole\" and \"Coccolo\", sung by Eri Kawai as the voice of Athena Glory, were gibberish. The lyrics for the first two seasons' theme songs were also initially meant to be gibberish, but after reading the manga Eri Kawai decided to write Japanese lyrics: \"I read the original manga and wrote the lyrics, using my image of Neo-Venezia as a starting point. Then did my best to match words that flowed with the melody.\" Kawai made demo recordings for Yui Makino as a guide for her performance of the theme songs. Takeshi Senoo has described \"Smile Again,\" the second ending theme song of \"Aria the Natural,\" as a song about the end of summer, and envisioned it being sung by Erino Hazuki as Akari.\n\nThe manga was written and illustrated by Kozue Amano, and has a complicated publishing history. \"Aqua\" was originally published by Enix in \"Monthly Stencil\" magazine from 2001 to 2002 and collected in two \"tankōbon\" volumes. When the series moved to Mag Garden's \"Comic Blade\" magazine in November 2002, the title changed to \"Aria\". Mag Garden later re-released the two volumes of \"Aqua\" with additional material and new covers. Serialization completed in April 2008. In all, the 70 serialized chapters of \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" were collected in 14 \"tankōbon\" volumes, each volume containing five chapters covering a season of the year. Each volume is called a \"voyage\" and each chapter a \"navigation.\"\n\nIn English, \"Aria\" (but not \"Aqua\") was originally licensed by ADV Manga, who dropped the license after publishing three volumes. The North American license for \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" was picked up by Tokyopop, which began releasing the series starting with the first volume of \"Aqua\". The series has been licensed in France by Kami, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Italy by Star Comics, in Indonesia by M&C Comics, in South Korea by Bookbox, in Spain by Editorial Ivrea, in Taiwan by Tong Li Comics, and in Thailand by Bongkoch Comics.\n\n\"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" were adapted by Hal Film Maker as a 54-episode anime television series comprising two seasons titled \"Aria the Animation\" and \"Aria the Natural\", an original video animation (OVA) titled \"Aria the OVA: Arietta\", and a third season titled \"Aria the Origination\". The series was directed by Junichi Sato with character designs by Makoto Koga, and broadcast on the TV Tokyo Network between 2005 and 2008. All three seasons have been released on DVD in Japan. The series was also broadcast in Italy on the Rai 4. A special OVA series, \"Aria the Avvenire\", received an event screening on 26 September 2015.\n\nThe series is licensed in North America by The Right Stuf International. A DVD box set of the English subtitled first season was released on 30 September 2008 under its Nozomi Entertainment imprint. The second season was released in two box sets on 29 January and 24 March 2009. The third season box set, including the \"Arietta\" OVA and the bonus episode numbered 5.5, was released on 2 March 2010. On 12 August 2017, Right Stuf launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce an English dub and a Blu-ray release for the first season of the series, which ended on 11 September, 2017 with a total of $595,676 raised, which is $230,000 over the final stretch goal of dubbing the entire franchise, including the 10th Anniversary special OVA series, \"Avvenire\". The series is licensed in Korea by Animax Asia, in Taiwan by Muse Communications, in France by Kaze, and in Italy by Yamato Video.\n\nIt was announced on 14 April 2020 that the franchise will debut a new work scheduled for this winter in celebration of the series' 15th Anniversary. \n\nSeveral soundtrack albums were released for \"Aria\", including an album for each of the three seasons of the anime, two piano music collections, a song collection, and a tribute album. Singles were released for the opening and closing themes for all three anime seasons, the OVA, and the two visual novel adaptations. Most of the releases charted on the Oricon charts, with the highest ranking album being \"Aria the Natural Vocal Song Collection\" at 30th, and the highest ranking single being \"Euforia\", the opening theme for \"Aria the Natural\", at 18th.\n\nFour series of drama CDs have been released. The first series was produced before the anime began and uses different voice actors; the other three were produced in conjunction with the three seasons of the anime, using the anime voice actors.\n\n\nAdditional drama CDs were included as bonus materials for each volume of \"Aria Perfect Guide\".\n\nAn \"Aria\" radio show called \"Aria the Station\" was broadcast on Internet through onsen.ag and Animate in conjunction with the three seasons of the anime. The 115 episodes were later compiled on \"radio CDs\" released in three seasons. Each volume contains a CD-ROM with the radio episodes in MP3 format plus an audio CD containing additional material. The radio show starred Erino Hazuki as Akari Mizunashi and Chinami Nishimura as President Aria Pokoteng, with other voice actors from the anime as guests reprising their respective roles.\n\n\nThe Alchemist company produced two visual novel video games for the PS2 based on \"Aria\". Both were released in regular and special editions on the same day.\n\n\nFour art books were published by Mag Garden containing drawings and sketches for \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" by Kozue Amano:\n\nMag Garden published a fifth art book containing additional artwork used in the anime, video games, drama CDs, and merchandising:\n\n\nIn addition, three poster books have been published, each containing ten A2-format posters:\n\n\nFour guide books to \"Aria\" have been released by Mag Garden:\n\n\nAdditionally Shinkigesha published guide books for each of Alchemist's two \"Aria\" video games, containing background materials, character profiles, and plot summaries covering all outcomes of the game:\n\n\"Aria\" has also been adapted as series of light novels published by Mag Garden, with two released as of December 2008:\n\n\n\"Monthly Undine\" is a spin-off facsimile of the undine-focused magazine mentioned in the \"Aria\" universe. Six issues of \"Monthly Undine\" has been released as of March 2008, with a different character on the cover, each containing collectible item. First three magazines contain, a toy house parts with Himeya's Akira and Aika, a toy house parts with Aria Company's Alicia and Akari, a toy house parts with Orange Planet's Athena and Alice respectively. When the three magazines' collectible items (toy houses parts) combined, they formed an \"ARIA Company\". \n\nIn March 2007, Mag Garden published a series of three \"Aria\" picture books. Each hardcover book contains a full-color short manga story focused on a cat president, and included an additional collectible item written and illustrated by Amano Kozue.\n\n\nShinko Music published a selection of sheet music called \"Aria the Best Selection\" () in July 2008. It contained the themes from the three anime seasons of \"Aria\".\n\nIn Japan, new volumes of \"Aria\" routinely reached the best-seller list for manga, and had sold over 3 million copies as of July 2007, representing 11% of all manga volumes ever sold by its publisher to date. In 2009, this number increased to 4 million.\n\nThe English translation of the \"Aria\" manga was described by a reviewer at \"The Comics Journal\" as \"quite conceivably the best comics series ever created for elementary-school girls,\" calling it \"a masterpiece of storytelling and illustration, gorgeous to look at and a feast for the young imagination in its ability to present an inviting, fully realized world.\" \"Aqua\" and \"Aria\" together have been praised for their joyful calm, vividly depicted futuristic world, moments of magic, and sense of whimsy. Amano's artwork is praised for her crisp lines and details, especially in the backgrounds and landscapes. Amano has also been criticized for confusingly giving every character a name that begins with A, for letting some slice-of-life stories \"drift too far out,\" and for making Akari's character too sweet and effusive.\n\nIn 2006, the anime of \"Aria\" was ranked in the top 100 animated television series of all time in a poll by TV Asahi. As of June 2007, the two first seasons of the anime adaptation had sold more than 300,000 DVDs.\n\nThe anime has been praised for its quiet atmosphere, beautiful visuals, especially the backgrounds and character designs, and exceptional soundtrack. Anime News Network described the first season as \"a gorgeous future fantasy populated with loveable characters,\" where \"each episode is a finely fashioned tone poem steeped in a love of the slow rhythms of everyday life and told with an elegant self-possession that places it light-years beyond the vulgar moralizing of most \"uplifting\" stories.\" IGN contrasted \"Aria\" with \"Maria-sama ga Miteru\" as another series where not much happens, noting that \"Maria-sama ratchets up the tension level whenever possible, though, and never mind that all the drama revolves around something completely inconsequential. Aria, on the other hand, is calm and relaxed. It freely admits that the plot is not the point.\" Several reviewers cited the characters as key to the appeal of the series, though some criticized the characters as unrealistic; the voice acting of Erino Hazuki (Akari) and Junko Minagawa (Akira) were particularly praised. Several reviewers point out that the series does not fit all tastes, being a slow-paced drama with an optimistic outlook.\n\n"}

It is the biggest technical institution of higher education in Russia, with close ties to local industry in the Urals. Its motto, \"Ingenium Creatio Labor\", means \"brilliance creates work\".\n\nUSTU has 20 faculties including: Metallurgical, Chemical Engineering, Building Materials, Civil Engineering, Physics and physics engineering, Radio Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Heat Power Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Economics and Management, Military Science, Physical Training, Humanities, Continuing education, and a Graduate school. USTU graduates 3000 engineers annually.\n\nUSTU was founded in 1920. It was formerly known as Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI).\n\nThe school has rapidly expanded due to the industrialization program of the Soviet Government, which created a high demand for engineering positions. The USTU was key in providing local industrial enterprises with technical and engineering staff.\n\nIn the 1940s, though suffering from a shortage of personnel due to World War II, the USTU received a great stimulus for development as the military needed to increase production for new industrial goods from the plants in the Urals. Many industrial plants were moved to the Urals due to the partial occupation of Western Russia by Nazi military forces.\n\nAfter the war, the USTU has kept close ties with the military industry, mostly by preparing a large amount of engineers for military purposes.\n\nWith the growth of Soviet Economy, the USTU kept expanding. In 1991, however, due to the economical crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it suffered from acute underfunding by the Russian Government. It was not until the mid-1990s that the USTU began to find appreciable non-governmental sources of funding, mostly by means of establishing business ties with local industrial enterprises that survived or arose as result of the economical crisis.\n\nCurrently, the USTU is preparing to undergo integration with several other universities in Yekaterinburg in order to increase its chances for successful competition with other universities in Russia.\n\nIn April 2008 it was named after Boris Yeltsin - Yeltsin Ural State Technical University.\n\n02.04.2010 USTU united with USU (Ural State University named after A. M. Gorky) and were named Ural Federal University.\n\n\n\n"}

JWK was formed in 1961 and is the oldest Polish special operations unit. The unit is located in Lubliniec, Poland. The Regiment has carried out the majority of special operations that resulted in the gathering of the actual Polish Intelligence. In the early years of the Global War on Terrorism, The Regiment carried out Special Operations alongside US Navy SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group also known as SEAL Team Six.\n\nThanks to the unit's high recruitment standards, and a special training program the Regiment implemented several years ago, the unit's soldiers display a very high level of skills and professionalism and are trained to undertake a wide range of special missions during war, crisis and peace time.\n\n\nAlong with being trained and competent in urban warfare, underwater warfare and mountain warfare, JWK personnel are able to carry out operations by land, air (including HALO and HAHO operations) or sea. In addition, JWK also possesses JTAC-qualified personnel.\n\nIt is worth noting that out of the 1800 worldwide, in JWK currently serve the only Polish soldiers having ever graduated from the grueling U.S. Special Operations Combat Medic Course (SOCM) at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nThe unit was established in 1961 under the name \"26 Batalion Dywersyjno – Rozpoznawczy\" (en. \"26th Sabotage-Reconnaissance Battalion\"), prior to being changed to \"1 Samodzielny Batalion Szturmowy\" (en. \"1st Detached Assault Battalion\") in 1964.\n\nOn October 8, 1993, following an executive order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, the unit transitioned from a battalion to a regiment, which led to its renaming to \"1 Pułk Specjalny\" (en. \"1st Special Regiment\") before being changed to \"1 Pułk Specjalny Komandosów\" (en. \"1st Special Commando Regiment\") in 1995. Even though the unit's name did not receive its \"Commando\" (Komandosow) moniker until 1995, it officially became a Special Operations Forces unit of the Polish Armed Forces following the 1993 executive order; making at the time 1 Pułk Specjalny the only unit subordinated to the command of the Land Forces branch of the Polish Army while at the same time operating as a Special Forces unit.\n\nAfter twelve years under the command of the Polish Land Forces, the unit transitioned to the Polish Special Forces Command (pl. \"Dowództwo Wojsk Specjalnych\") along with all other Polish Special Forces units when it was formed in 2007. \nFinally in 2011 (October 1) for its 50th anniversary, the unit was renamed \"Jednostka Wojskowa Komandosów\" which at present is its current name. Within Poland's Armed Forces organization, the unit is referred to by its code number JW4101.\n\nJWK is currently operating under the command of płk (Col.) Wiesław Kukuła. The unit operates with a combat structure comparable to Special Forces Groups, 2nd Commando Regiment and is composed of four \"Zespoł Bojowy\" (English:Squadrons), with a fourth set up by 2016; respectively ZB A, ZB B, ZB C and ZB D.\n\nEach of these teams carry the traditions of Polish units from World War II. ZB A inherits its traditions from Polski Samodzielny Batalion Specjalny and Batalion Miotła, ZB B inherits theirs from the No. 6 Troop (Polish) of the No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and ZB C inherits theirs from Batalion Parasol. It should also be noted that the headquarters detachment of the military unit also carries traditions from World War II, which are those of Batalion Zośka from the Polish Home Army resistance movement.\n\nCurrent Structure:\n\nAll three combat detachments as well as the HQ & Logistics Detachment have their own insignias, all carrying on Poland's legacy from World War II.\nAlong with all other Wojska Specjalne units, JWK is currently subordinated to the \"Centrum Operacji Specjalnych - Dowództwo Komponentu Wojsk Specjalnych\" (COS-DKWS, en. \"Special Operations Center - Special Forces Component Command\"); which itself is subordinated to the Armed Forces Branches Operational Command (Pol. \"Dowództwo Operacyjne Rodzajów Sił Zbrojnych\") and Armed Forces Branches General Command's Inspectorate of Wojska Specjalne (Pol. \"Dowództwo Generalne Rodzajów Sił Zbrojnych\"), (Pol. \"Inspektorat Wojsk Specjalnych\"). Before Komorowski & Koziej reform (structure till 31.12.2013) from Biuro Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego, Wojska Specjalne had simply organisation of commanding (force user & force provider) - Dowództwo Wojsk Specjalnych.\n\nContinuing with its tradition of honoring and remembering Poland's legacy from World War II, JWK unveiled its new insignia on December 30, 2013 with the formal debut being January 1, 2014. The unit described it as a \"combination of tradition and modernity\", with the insignia referring to the legacy of the Polish Home Army, while at the same time bringing in modernity by incorporating the distinctive symbols of partisan & commando forces.\n\nThe anchor, known as Kotwica, refers to the \"Poland Fighting\" symbol of the Polish resistance movement from World War II, which was present on the insignia of Batalion Miotła (current insignia of JWK's Squadron A), Batalion Parasol (current insignia of JWK's Squadron C) and Batalion Zośka (current insignia of JWK's Sub-Command and Security element); the three reconnaissance battalions from the Polish Home Army.\n\nIncorporated in the \"Kotwica\" anchor is a dagger, a worldwide-recognizable symbol of the Special Operations Forces and also a nod to the unit's previous insignias both as 1PSK and as JWK.\n\nThe red color of the emblem refers to the color of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando unit from World War II and its No. 6 Polish Troop also known as the 1st Independent Company, whose Combined Operations recognition badge serves as the current insignia for JWK's Squadron B. The black background of the unit's insignia is a nod to the official color of the Polish Special Forces.\n\nCandidates wanting to serve in the Regiment must first successfully undertake a basic military training course. They then move on to a three-month “Junior Specialist” training course. During this phase recruits receive training in close combat, hand to hand combat, fighting with specialised equipment, parachuting, land navigation, weapons handling, basic survival, and several other military-related skills. Troops who successfully complete the second phase then move onto the unit, where they are assigned to Zespół Bojowy. Once there, additional training continues (mountain and cold weather training, sniper, Casevac, amphibious operations, etc.). Volunteering soldiers from the unit can receive advanced training in allied countries, most notably the U.S. Army Ranger course.\n\nThe regiment has been quite active in recent years. In 2003, troops were deployed to support NATO operations in the Republic of Macedonia during the Kosovo conflict; a13-man detachment was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Polish support for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In 2006, they had charge of protecting the Polski Kontyngent Wojskowy (Polish Military Contingent) in Pakistan which helped in technical rescue after the Pakistan earthquake. Until 2008, the unit had deployed a 56-man company to Iraq (Iraq War) as part of the Multinational Division Central-South in Diwaniyah. Soldiers fought together with the 5th SFG ODA and were fighting and leading special operations throughout Afghanistan, including the Kandahar Province. Since 2010 JWK compound formed ISAF SOF Task Force 50 which perform special operations like capturing JPEL's, Special Reconnaissance, FID. TF-50 soldiers are operating in Ghazni Province and Paktika (War in Afghanistan). In 2016, JW Komandosów was tasked with training the elite Ukrainian 1st Battalion, 79th Airborne-Assault Brigade, whose soldiers were nicknamed Cyborgs for their famous defense of Donetsk airport in 2014.\n\nLike all units subordinated to COS-DKWS, JWK personnel wear a MultiCam or Suez (Poland's own version of MultiCam developed around 2007, no longer issued and currently being phased out) uniform while in garrison. For various reasons, they may also wear civilian clothing. Soldiers may also wear a distinctive dark green beret with a badge depicting the Eagle of the Polish Special Forces, though it is not mandatory except for a formal ceremony or with the dress uniform. Apart from Command personnel, all other personnel wear uniforms and berets that bear no name or rank so as to conceal and protect their identities. Civilian haircuts and facial hairs are authorized to help soldiers blend-in with the rest of the population. Every soldier serving in a combat capacity within the unit has a nickname used to refer to him when in a public environment.\n\nWeapons in use within JWK as of mid-2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its inception the unit has lost eleven members as a result of active military duty.\n\n\n"}

Watson, M.D. is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel by Nicholas Meyer, published in 1976. It takes place after two of Meyer's other Holmes pastiches, \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\" and \"The Canary Trainer\", though it was published in between the two.\n\nThe plot concerns a series of strange murders in London's theatre district at the end of the 19th century. It also includes a first meeting between Holmes and Doctor Moore Agar, whose \"dramatic introduction to Holmes\" was one that Watson, in the original Arthur Conan Doyle story \"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\", wrote that he \"may some day recount.\"\n\n\"The West End Horror\" made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for eleven weeks between June 13, 1976 and August 22, 1976.\n\nThe book is written in the form of a false document. It opens with a foreword by Meyer, who states that the manuscript was brought to his attention by a woman with some familial connection to Horace Vernet, an ancestor of Holmes. The woman had read \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\" and thought Meyer might be interested. Although damaged by water, the manuscript proved authentic.\n\nDr. Watson explains in his own preface that he did not publish the story because of the number of well-known persons who would be affected - persons whose identity would be impossible to disguise. Holmes had for a long time refused Watson permission to write the story on these very grounds, but Watson eventually persuaded him by promising to place the manuscript in Holmes' hands, the only condition being that he not destroy it.\n\nThe story involves many well-known people, including George Bernard Shaw, who hires Holmes to look into the death of an unpleasant theatre critic; Sir Arthur Sullivan, one of whose singers at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company was another victim of the murderer; and others including W. S. Gilbert, Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry and Frank Harris.\n\nIn the novel, Holmes clears the name of a shy Parsee Indian wrongfully accused of murder; in real life Conan Doyle played a significant part in helping George Edalji, a Parsee victim of injustice in the English court.\n"}

This episode introduces the character Faith, another vampire slayer, who will become a key player in Sunnydale. While the rest of the gang gets to know Faith, Giles suspects that Faith and Buffy aren't being entirely honest about recent events in their lives. Some new vampires arrive in Sunnydale with their own agendas and a familiar face returns. It was written by David Greenwalt, directed by James A. Contner, and first broadcast on October 13, 1998.\n\nKakistos and his colleague, Mr. Trick arrive in town, discussing how they will kill the slayer. Buffy and her mother Joyce attend a meeting with Principal Snyder who reluctantly allows Buffy to return to the school, having been overruled by the school board.\n\nBuffy and Willow go to the library, where Giles questions Buffy about what happened the night she killed Angel and defeated Acathla, ostensibly to help him with a binding spell to prevent the demon from being resurrected. That night at the Bronze, fellow student Scott Hope attempts to talk to Buffy, but she becomes distracted by a suspected vampire leading a girl outside. Buffy and the rest of the group watch as the girl kills the vampire. The girl introduces herself as Faith, a new vampire slayer.\n\nCordelia suggests that the death of Kendra the Vampire Slayer must have summoned Faith. The group take a liking to Faith, but Buffy remains skeptical. Kakistos and Mr. Trick plot revenge on Faith for mutilating Kakistos' face.\n\nThat night, while the slayers are patrolling together, they are attacked by vampires. While Buffy struggles with several vampires, Faith focuses only on one, beating the vampire repeatedly instead of helping Buffy. Giles tells Buffy the vampires were working for Kakistos, an ancient vampire with cloven hands and feet. After leaving the library, Buffy runs into Scott, who tries to ask her out on a date. Buffy accepts, but she runs away very disturbed when Scott hands her a Claddagh ring like the one Angel gave her. Giles tells Buffy that Faith's watcher is dead, not at a retreat center as Faith had said.\n\nBuffy goes to see Faith at her motel room and tells her Kakistos is in town. Faith tells Buffy that Kakistos murdered her watcher some weeks earlier in Boston and he swore revenge on her for mutilating him with an axe. As Faith tries to leave, Kakistos and a group of vampires break into the room. Buffy and Faith escape through a window, but are driven into Kakistos lair. Buffy fights and slays many of the vampires while Kakistos attacks Faith. Eventually, Faith impales Kakistos with a large beam, killing him. Mr. Trick flees with another vampire.\n\nInspired by Faith standing up to her fears and conquering them, Buffy finally reveals to Giles and Willow that Angel was cured when she killed him. Although she is skeptical that the information will help with a binding spell, Buffy feels better for having told them. After Buffy leaves, Willow approaches Giles to offer her help with the spell, but Giles tells her that there is no spell, he wanted Buffy to open up about what happened between her and Angel. \n\nBuffy talks to Scott and, after explaining her reaction to the ring, they make plans to go out. She returns to the mansion where she killed Angel. Buffy places her Claddagh ring on the ground and says goodbye. After she leaves, the ring starts to vibrate and Angel returns from hell.\n\n\"Faith, Hope, & Trick\" introduces the minor character Mr. Trick. After Principal Robin Wood and Kendra, he is the longest-running character of color in the series. According to Elyce Rae Helford, in an unusually long speech for such a minor character, he \"overtly clarifies the racial metaphor underlying the show's narrative by comparing African Americans in Washington, D.C., with vampires in Sunnydale and by conceiving both as equivalent examples of 'darkness.\n\n"}

Buffy has to deal with the fact that Angel is back from Hell, broken and animalistic.\n\nThe day of a full moon, Xander and Giles learn about a brutal murder in the woods the night before. They discover that Xander had slept through his watch of the werewolf Oz, and that the window in the pen is open.\n\nBuffy talks to Mr. Platt, the school psychologist, about her life and begins to open up. On patrol that night, Angel attacks her in the woods. Animalistic, he is no match for Buffy, who chains him up in the mansion.

Willow, Xander and Cordelia enter the morgue to collect hair samples from the body of the mauled boy.\n\nBuffy tells Giles that she had a vivid dream of Angel coming back. Giles explains that time passes differently in demonic dimensions, so any being who manages to return would most likely have been turned into a monster. Buffy wonders if Angel was responsible for the murder; the hair samples were inconclusive.\n\nPete and Debbie sneak into a room to make out. Pete discovers that one of his jars has been emptied and accuses Debbie of drinking its contents. Buffy returns to Mr. Platt's office and pours her heart out, then realizes that he has been mauled to death.\n\nPete yells at Debbie, then transforms into a monster. He tells her that he used to need the substance to turn into the monster, but now only needs to get mad. He begins beating Debbie, then tells her it's her fault for making him mad, turning back into his human form. She forgives him.\n\nOz is no longer suspected, as Mr. Platt was killed during the day. He meets up with Debbie and notices her black eye. Buffy and Willow seek out Debbie, and try in vain to talk sense into her.

The sun sets and the tables are turned when Oz transforms into his werewolf form, Oz becoming evenly matched in strength and begins fighting Pete. Buffy tries to tranquilize Oz, but Debbie pushes the gun away and Buffy ends up shooting Giles. Buffy chases after Pete while Willow and Faith pursue Oz.\n\nAfter a struggle, Faith sedates Oz with a dart. Buffy follows Pete's blood trail, but he finds Debbie first and despite her pleas and attempts to appease him, he kills her. Buffy finds Pete, but he knocks her to the ground and advances threateningly on her. Angel arrives and he and Pete begin fighting; Angel uses the chains that still bind his wrists to kill Pete. Afterwards, he reverts to his human face and calls out Buffy's name before falling to his knees and embracing her in tears. Buffy begins to cry as well, finally accepting that Angel is back.\n\nAccording to Erin Waggoner, \"Beauty and the Beasts\" is an example of a Buffy episode that condemns aggressive masculinity. It shows a male student hoping to appear more virile by using a potion, resulting in a \"Jekyll and Hyde\"-style change of character and the physical and verbal abuse of his girlfriend.\n\n"}

They overhear Buffy mention that a limo will pick up both her and Faith to take them to the Homecoming dance. The gang sends Cordelia to remind Buffy that yearbook photos are about to take place, but Cordelia is too busy campaigning for Homecoming Queen. After discovering that her favorite teacher does not remember her, and that it was Cordelia's fault that she missed yearbook photos, Buffy decides to compete for the Homecoming Queen title.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trick introduces a competition, \"SlayerFest '98\", with a group of participants including German twin assassins Hans & Fredrick Gruenstahler, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" hunter Frawley, Kulak, a demon of the Miquot Clan, and Lyle Gorch from \"Bad Eggs\" and his new wife Candy. When Xander and Willow try on their Homecoming outfits, tension builds until they finally kiss.\n\nOn Homecoming night, Buffy is collected by a limo containing Cordelia instead of Faith. Cordelia gives Buffy a note from the rest of the gang who hope that Buffy and Cordelia will make up. Upon exiting the limo, the girls find themselves isolated in a remote location. They find a video tape message, addressed to Buffy and Faith, detailing the hunting of the slayers in SlayerFest '98. The participants attack and after Buffy defeats Frawley, the girls seek shelter in a cabin.\n\nBuffy and Cordelia find a phone and attempt to alert Giles to their situation, but the phone is soon cut dead. They begin to bond when Cordelia admits that she loves Xander and Buffy reveals that she spent a year's allowance on her dress. Kulak arrives and fights with Buffy until the German assassins fire a grenade into the cabin. Buffy and Cordelia escape back to the library, but Kulak is killed.\n\nUpon arriving at the library, Buffy and Cordelia find Giles has been knocked unconscious by Lyle and Candy. Buffy manages to stake Candy, but is knocked out in the process. Cordelia then scares off Lyle by persuading him that she is a bigger threat than Buffy. When Buffy and Giles regain consciousness, they discover the tracking devices in the corsages. Buffy distracts the German assassins as they enter the school, managing to plant the trackers on them and have them annihilate each other with their high-tech equipment. Mr. Trick is escorted to the Mayor's office, who recruits him to help control the rebellious youth of Sunnydale. Buffy and Cordelia finally arrive at the Homecoming dance to find that neither of them won the title.\n\n\"Homecoming\" was criticized by Bryan Senn for concentrating too much on Buffy's self-pity, which prompts her to campaign to be Homecoming Queen. It leaves little time for the hunting-humans-as-sport storyline, a twist on the theme of Richard Connell's 1924 short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" and its 1932 film adaptation of the same name.\n\n"}

It was written by Jane Espenson, directed by Michael Lange, and first broadcast on November 10, 1998.\n\nPrincipal Snyder hands out boxes of candy to all the students, which they must sell to pay for new marching band uniforms. Buffy sells half of her chocolate bars to her mom, and the other half to Giles. She then visits Angel, who is practicing T'ai chi. When she arrives home, Buffy finds her mother and Giles eating the band candy.\n\nThe next day, Giles fails to show up for study hall, where Xander and Willow are playing footsie. Worried, Buffy goes to Giles' home and finds her mom on the couch. Joyce offhandedly gives her the car keys to drive home, to Buffy's astonishment. Giles, now acting like he did as a teen, invites Joyce out for some fun.\n\nBuffy and Willow find The Bronze packed with adults who are acting like teenagers, including Principal Snyder. They return to Giles' place to find out what is going on.\n\nAt the warehouse, the vampire Mr. Trick checks up on Ethan Rayne and the production of the chocolate bars. Trick suddenly accuses one of the workers of eating the candy, and kills him as an example to the others.\n\nBuffy eventually puts two and two together and realizes that the candy is making everyone act like immature teenagers. She sends Willow and Oz to the library and drives to the warehouse. Upon arrival, Buffy finds her mother and Giles kissing in the middle of the street. Inside the warehouse, Buffy catches Ethan; her threat of violence persuades him to reveal that Trick needs to dull Sunnydale adults in order to collect a tribute for a demon named Lurconis. Meanwhile, four vampires enter the hospital to remove four newborn babies. Willow phones Buffy from the library and tells her that Lurconis eats babies. Giles remembers that the demon may be found in the sewers.\n\nDown in the sewers, the Mayor and Mr. Trick wait impatiently while the four vampires chant in a ceremony to summon Lurconis. Buffy, Giles and Joyce crash the party, and the Mayor quickly flees unnoticed. Buffy fights the vampires while Giles and Joyce take the babies to safety. The huge snake-like demon appears and swallows one of the vampires whole. Giles attacks Trick, but is thrown into the path of Lurconis. Buffy pulls down a gas pipe, igniting a fire that kills the demon.\n\nBack at his office, the Mayor asks why Trick fled, allowing Buffy to kill Lurconis. Trick replies that he thought he did the Mayor a favor by having the Slayer kill the demon, leaving one less demon to whom the Mayor would owe tribute. The Mayor warns Trick against doing him any more such favors.\n\nThe next day, the adults have returned to their senses. Buffy and Giles meet Joyce, and Buffy exclaims that they are lucky she stopped them before they did more than they did. Joyce and Giles look very embarrassed, but Buffy fails to notice.\n\nThis is the first episode where script writer Jane Espenson is credited. Later on, she would love to put Giles and Joyce in front of embarrassing situations in the episodes she'd write, as a recollection of their sexual intercourse happening in \"Band Candy\".\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" writes that the episode \"shows an alternate version of Sunnydale that's grounded in the town's own dark reality. Or as Oz says, 'Sobering mirror to look into, huh?\n\nList-maker and reviewer Jacob Hall wrote, \"Season three's 'Band Candy' is probably one of the goofiest episodes of the entire series, but it's also one of the funniest, showcasing the writing staff's tremendous wit and the range of the show's supporting cast. The episode deals with a dark enchantment forcing the adults of Sunnydale to revert to their teenage mentalities, transforming the likes of Giles, Mrs. Summers and Principal Snyder into hilarious alternate versions of themselves. As awesome as it is to see Anthony Stewart Head pull off a 'bad boy' thing, the episode more than earns its place on its list for Armin Shimerman's sad, pathetic and totally endearing take on his normally cruel character.\"\n\n"}

She is British, rude, confident, and looks down on all the Scoobies, especially Giles. She warns them that the demon Lagos is in Sunnydale looking for the Glove of Myhnegon, a powerful gauntlet.\n\nWhile doing research, Xander and Willow kiss for a second time. Xander goes looking for the Glove of Myneghon, but is distracted when he sees Angel, of whose resurrection the Scoobies had been unaware. Xander follows Angel, hoping to re-stake him, but observes Angel and Buffy kissing. Angel shows Buffy that he has recovered the glove. As Giles is meeting with Gwendolyn, Xander arrives to tell him about Angel. Gwendolyn does not overhear the conversation, but knows that they are keeping something from her.\n\nThe next morning, the gang stages an intervention with Buffy. Both Xander and Cordelia are openly hostile about Angel and see him as a serious threat, unable to separate him from the recent misdeeds of Angelus. Willow is less sure and advises caution, partly motivated by guilt about her own private romantic indiscretions with Xander. Buffy tells them that Angel has the glove and that they are going to destroy it. Giles ultimately comes to Buffy's defense, but in private scolds her for not telling him about Angel's return.\n\nGwendolyn goes to visit Faith at the motel and mentions that Giles is having a secret meeting with Buffy and her friends. The angry Faith ends up in a bar with Xander, who tells her that Angel is alive and has the glove, adding that Buffy knew about Angel's resurrection and possession of the glove but tried to keep it secret. The two nurse their grudges together; Faith decides to slay Angel and Xander eagerly volunteers to accompany her.\n\nGiles tells Gwendolyn where the glove is, and that \"a friend of Buffy's\" has it. He wants to discuss destroying it with her, but when he turns his back, Gwendolyn bludgeons him, knocking him out. Xander returns with Faith to get weapons, but he finds Giles unconscious and gravely injured; he calls an ambulance. Faith assumes that Angel attacked Giles, but Xander thinks it unlikely as there are no bite marks. Faith leaves to hunt down Angel. Xander tells Buffy about Faith's goal. Gwendolyn shows up at the mansion first and tries to kill Angel, not knowing that he is a vampire. Faith arrives as Angel is fighting with Gwendolyn. She assumes Angel is after the glove and attacks him. Buffy attempts to stop her, but Gwendolyn tells Faith to attack Buffy, and the two slayers fight.\n\nHaving successfully distracted the slayers and enlisted the help of Xander and Willow, Gwendolyn puts on the glove and tests its power to manipulate lightning. The gang now realize who the real enemy is, and unite against her. Angel saves Willow from Gwendolyn's lightning bolt attack. Faith draws her fire which allows Buffy to throw a piece of glass to sever her gloved arm, leading to Gwendolyn's death by electrocution when the next bolt of lightning strikes.\n\nBuffy and her friends reconciled and they are willing to forgive Angel for everything. Giles found out Gwendolyn was kicked out of the watcher's council and went rogue. Buffy went to Faith motel room, Faith decided not to trust anyone after Post betrays her.\n\nValerie Frankel described the episode's villain, Gwendolyn Post, as \"arguably the most powerful woman of the show\". She said that while Post appears to be the strong female mentor that Buffy and Faith otherwise lack, it is significant that \"innocent Willow\", who represents Buffy's sensitive side, is threatened by her. Noel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" said the final battle was predictable, but praised the scene where Post puts on the glove and has her arm severed by Buffy.\n\n"}

Neighbouring villages are Blaenllechau, Maerdy and Tylorstown. Ferndale was industrialised in the mid-19th century. The first coal mine shaft was sunk in 1857 and was the first community to be intensively industrialised in the Rhondda Valley.\n\nIn Welsh, Ferndale is known as Glynrhedynog, the name of one of the old farms on which the town is built. In its infancy Glynrhedynog was also known as Trerhondda after the name of the first large chapel to be built in the town. The naming of settlements after chapels was widespread in Wales at the time, as is shown in village names such as Bethesda, Beulah and Horeb, but neither Glynrhedynog nor Trerhondda was destined to be used for long.\n\"Glynrhedynog\" is made from the words \"glyn\" meaning valley and \"rhedynog\" meaning ferny, and so coal from the Glynrhedynog pits was marketed as Ferndale coal, a much easier name for English buyers to assimilate.\n\nThe Ferndale pits are what drew the workforce and their families to the area, and by the 1880s \"Ferndale\" was well established as a thriving town. With the phasing in of bilingual road signs from the late 1980s onwards, the name Glynrhedynog gradually reappeared and is now the officially designated Welsh language name for Ferndale. The Welsh language is on the increase in Ferndale after the village adopted the English language during the Industrial revolution. A Welsh language school is situated near the park and the school is named after the park's lake, 'Llyn-y-Forwyn.' (The Maiden's Lake)\n\nThe pioneer of coal mining at Ferndale was David Davis of Blaengwawr, Aberdare who already had an extensive colliery business in the neighbouring Aberdare Valley. His wealth enabled him to engage in costly but unsuccessful singings in the Rhondda Fach in the 1860s until he finally struck a good seam at Ferndale.\n\nTwo large coal mining colliery disasters occurred in Ferndale during the 19th century. The first occurred on 8 November 1867, when an underground explosion killed 178 miners at the Ferndale Colliery owned by David Davis and Sons Ltd. The second disaster happened on 10 June 1869 when a further explosion resulted in the death of 53 miners.\n\nThe Ferndale electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Ferndale community and elects two county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has mainly been by the Labour Party but the ward had a Plaid Cymru from 1999-2004 and an Independent councillor from 2012-17. At the May 2017 election Labour and Plaid Cymru won a councillor each.\n\nA 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Ferndale merged with neighbouring Maerdy. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections.\n\nFerndale has developed over recent years. Some new features have been added such as a new astro-turf field, car park and an all weather cricket training enclosure. The Sky1 TV comedy series Stella is largely filmed on location in Ferndale.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1856, the Taff Vale Railway opened the Maerdy Branch from , including a station at Ferndale. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1964 but coal trains continued until August 1986 when the line closed completely. Coal from Mardy Colliery was then raised through Tower Colliery. The track was lifted in 1996. Since 2005, the southern section from Porth to Pontygwaith is now the A4223 Porth and Lower Rhondda Fach Relief Road (Porth Bypass). The upper section including the section passing Ferndale has become a branch of the Taff Trail cycleway.\n\nThere are several chapels and churches in or near Ferndale:\n\nFerndale is home to rugby union club Ferndale RFC, whose first XV team play in the Welsh Rugby Union leagues.\n\nAdjacent to Llyn y Forwyn is an astro-turf football field that, during the Summer, annually becomes the ground of sports days for many of the local junior schools. Also within the confines of Darran Park can be found a tennis court and bowling green.\n\nIn December 2006, the Ferndale Skate Park was opened with indoor ramps and other equipment available to BMX riders, rollerbladers and skateboarders. The skatepark began with the aim of improving the prospects of school leavers in the area, providing a 'safe haven' from the influences of drugs and alcohol and an attempt to bring sports and healthy living to the area in a novel approach. It has since received National Lottery continuation funding as well as a Rhondda Trust grant to secure the future for an additional 3-year period. It closed in 2014 \n\n\n"}

Hugely successful for its wit and wide coverage of the field, the guide was nonetheless idiosyncratic and often sarcastic, with entries such as: \"the b[oo]ks are slowly transforming themselves back into rags\"; \"judging by body temp, shop seems to have expired in 1930\"; \"I could smell a bargain, pity was I had a cold that day\"; \"owner has been unwell recently with bad back (possibly caused by turning on the customers once too often)\".\n\nDriffield also launched a periodical called \"Driffs: The Antiquarian and Secondhand Fortnightly\", although the magazine was rarely published as frequently as that and folded after 22 issues.\n\nThe guide went through at least five editions, dated 1984, 1987, 1991, 1992 and 1995. In the third he seemed to refer to a spell of mental illness after the publication of the second, though Francis Wheen thought this an intentionally misleading reference.\n\nAlthough photos existed of Driffield (he fancied he resembled Raymond Carver), for a long time, little was known about him or his current whereabouts, or even if he was still alive, until 2014, when he was the defendant in a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, accused of five counts of indecent assault, one count of indecency with a child and two counts of rape. It was alleged that he had used these events as the inspiration for a novel. Driffield was found not guilty of these allegations. He stood trial under the name Xavier Driffield, although previously some sources had cited his name (seemingly erroneously) as \"B.C.M. Driffield\" and others as \"David Richard Ian Frederick Field\". He claimed to have been brought up in Newbury, England. In 1991 Francis Wheen considered that he \"seems to be in his forties\".\n\nDrif appears as a character in Iain Sinclair's novel \"White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings\". He took part in the 1992 documentary \"The Cardinal And The Corpse\", made by Chris Petit for Channel 4 and also featuring Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of Charles Cornwallis, the 1st Marquess Cornwallis, British commander at the siege of Yorktown. Cornwallis took part in a number of decisive battles including the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758, when he was 14, and the Battle of the Saintes but is best known as a friend of Lord Nelson and as the commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet during the Napoleonic Wars. He is depicted in the Horatio Hornblower novel, \"Hornblower and the Hotspur\".\n\nHis affectionate contemporary nickname from \"the ranks\" was Billy Blue, and a sea shanty was written during his period of service, reflecting the admiration his men had for him.\n\nWilliam Cornwallis was born 10 February 1744. His father was Charles, the fifth baron and first earl Cornwallis, and his mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Viscount Charles Townshend. William was the younger brother of General Charles Cornwallis.\n\nThe young William entered the navy in 1755 aboard the 80-gun bound for North America in the fleet of Admiral Edward Boscawen. Cornwallis was shortly after exchanged into and was present in her at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758. The siege was one of the pivotal battles of the war. Louisbourg was the only deep water harbour that the French controlled in North America, and its capture enabled the British to launch an attack on Quebec City. General James Wolfe's attack on Quebec and victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham saw the beginning of the end of French colonisation in North America.\n\nWhen \"Kingston\" returned to England in 1759, Cornwallis was taken aboard the 60-gun by Captain Robert Digby. During the planned French invasion of Britain in 1759 \"Dunkirk\" was with Admiral Edward Hawke's squadron and took part in the Battle of Quiberon Bay against the French fleet under Admiral Conflans. The victory was part of what became known as \"Annus Mirabilis of 1759\" and in concert with the other victories of that year gave the Royal Navy almost complete dominance over the oceans for over a century. The succession of victories led Horace Walpole to remark \"our bells are worn threadbare ringing for victories\".\n\nCornwallis remained in \"Dunkirk\" when she was assigned to the Mediterranean fleet then commanded by Admiral Charles Saunders. \"Dunkirk\" was detached on blockade duty, ensuring the French fleet remained in the city of Heraklion, Crete. Cornwallis moved to Saunders' flagship where he remained for little over a year. On 5 April 1761 Cornwallis passed his examination for lieutenant and was promoted into the newly commissioned third-rate . In July 1761 Cornwallis was with \"Thunderer\" and two other line-of-battle ships blockading Cadiz. Two French ships escaped the blockade and the British squadron set off in pursuit. \"Thunderer\" caught up with the 64-gun and captured her in a single-ship action that lasted about half an hour. The British lost seventeen killed and one hundred and thirteen wounded.\n\nIn July 1762 Cornwallis received his first command in the 8-gun sloop-of-war . In 1763 he was given command of the more powerful and newly launched 14-gun . He continued in her into the peace with France after the Treaty of Paris had ended the war in 1763. During the peace in 1765 he was promoted post-captain and given command of the 44-gun . He commanded her until she was paid off and the ship was sold in 1766. In September of the same year he was given command of and was variously employed throughout the peace between the Seven Years' War and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhen the French lent their official support to the American cause in 1778 with the Treaty of Alliance and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the war between Britain and the United States became a global war. Captain Cornwallis was in command of the newly commissioned . \"Lion\" was sent, with Admiral John Byron, to the West Indies.\n\n When war was officially declared, the Comte d'Estaing, the French naval commander in North America swiftly captured the islands of Saint Vincent and Grenada. Byron on hearing the news that Saint Vincent had been captured assembled his forces but on his way to recapture the island he received intelligence that d'Estaing and his fleet were in the process of capturing Grenada. Byron consequently took his fleet to Grenada in the hopes of engaging them and preventing the capture of Grenada. The island however had only held out for two days and was already in French hands.\n\nThe Battle of Grenada took place on 6 July 1779. d'Estaing saw the British fleet of 21 ships of the line approaching and weighed anchor. Byron gave chase and attempted to form line of battle as per the Sailing and Fighting Instructions set down by Admiral Blake in 1653. d'Estaing, realising that his force although superior in guns was not so in numbers, had ordered his captains not to engage directly but to bear away when British ships approached and to bear down on any individual ship that might through wind or poor seamanship become separated from the line.\n\nThis tactic proved successful and d'Estaing's ships managed to escape the superior force causing considerable damage to three of the British ships. Cornwallis \"Lion\" was one of those ships and when he became separated from the British fleet she was forced to break away and make a run for Jamaica rather than risk capture. \"Lion\" suffered a reported 21 killed and 30 wounded.\n\nDuring his time in the West Indies, Cornwallis came to own, then later free the \"doctoress\" Cubah Cornwallis. Cubah became Cornwallis' mistress and housekeeper in Port Royal, Jamaica. Later she treated Cornwallis' friend, Captain Horatio Nelson on his return from the disastrous mission to Nicaragua. She also treated Prince William Henry, later William IV, when he was stationed in the West Indies.\n\n\"Lion\" remained on the Jamaica station under the orders of Admiral Peter Parker and when she was repaired began a series of cruises in the West Indies. On 20 April 1780 Cornwallis was in command of a small squadron of two line-of-battle ships, \"Lion\" and and one large 44-gun frigate, .\n\nOff Saint-Domingue the small British squadron discovered a convoy under the protection of four ships-of-the-line and one frigate commanded by Monsieur de la Motte Picquet. The French chased and the British ran. The French outsailed the British ships and when in range opened fire. The chase continued throughout the night and into the morning of the 21st. The breeze died and the two squadrons began to repair their damage. When the wind blew once more the chase renewed and continued throughout the night of the 21st and into the 22nd.\n\nOn the morning of the 22nd three sails appeared to leeward. The arrival of these new sails would determine the outcome of the battle. The newcomers proved to be the 64-gun , the 32-gun and the 28-gun . The French squadron bore away for Cap-Français, leaving the two small British squadrons to repair and make for Jamaica. The British squadron under Cornwallis had lost 12 killed including Captain Glover of the \"Janus\".\n\nCornwallis returned to England in \"Lion\" in June 1781 and took part in the second relief of Gibraltar. He was appointed to command the 74-gun third-rate , and immediately returned to the West Indies under the orders of Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood.\n\n\"Canada\" was with Hood's fleet at the Battle of St. Kitts in 1782. Hood took his 21 ships of the line and lured the French fleet of 29 ships of the line under the Comte de Grasse from its anchorage at Basseterre on St. Kitts and then sailed into the roadstead and anchored. Hood then repulsed de Grasse's efforts to dislodge the British fleet. The Battle of Brimstone Hill sealed the fate of the island despite Hood's efforts and St. Kitts fell into French hands. With the island in enemy hands and the French fleet cruising off the harbour, Hood was forced to withdraw and made his way to Antigua. \"Canada\" in Commodore Edmund Affleck's division suffered 1 killed and 12 wounded. On 22 March Hood joined Admiral George Rodney's fleet in Barbados\n\n Between 9 April 1782 and 12 April 1782, \"Canada\" made up part of the fleet of Admiral Rodney at the Battle of the Saintes. During the battle, Cornwallis and \"Canada\" were fourth in line on the starboard tack in the centre division between and . \"Canada\" sustained 35 casualties in total with 12 killed and the rest wounded. The outcome of the battle meant that the French and Spanish abandoned their planned invasion of Britain's most valuable Caribbean island, Jamaica. The battle, although a victory for the English caused a great deal of controversy in later years that included Cornwallis' direct criticism in writing of Rodney. The final couplet of the poem said to have been written in Cornwallis' own hand reads:\n\nIt appears that the criticisms of Admiral Hood and Cornwallis went unheard and Rodney was created a baron and given a life pension of £2,000 per year. Cornwallis was sent home under Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves with the convoy that included the captured French flagship . A violent storm hit the convoy and \"Ville de Paris\" sank along with several of the convoy and one of the escorts, . The convoy and her escorts finally arrived at Portsmouth and \"Canada\" was paid off in October 1782.\n\nIn January 1783 Cornwallis was given command of and in March of the same year was moved to HM Yacht \"Charlotte\". The American Revolutionary War between Britain and the allied forces of America and France ended with Britain's defeat in September 1783 and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Paris. With the peace came the downsizing of the navy. Cornwallis however remained employed in command of the royal yacht until 1787. In 1787 he was briefly given command of before hoisting his broad pennant as commodore in the 64-gun in October 1788 when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the East Indies Station.\n\nIn November 1791 Cornwallis ordered that French shipping be intercepted and searched for contraband. The British and French were not at war but the French were openly aiding the Tipu Sultan in his war against the British. Cornwallis detached Captain Richard Strachan in to intercept the and two French merchant ships that were heading for the French held port of Mangalore. The subsequent Battle of Tellicherry\n\nThough the conflict with Tipu Sultan was over, the French Revolutionary Wars had only begun. Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 February 1793, Cornwallis remained in the area and aided in the capture of Pondicherry, captaining his new flagship, the frigate , and commanding a small flotilla of three East Indiamen—\"Triton\", \"Princess Charlotte\", and . He left command of Pondicherry to Captain King and returned to England, docking at Spithead in August 1793. He was succeeded in command of the East Indies Station by Commodore (later Admiral) Peter Rainier.\n\nIn May 1794 he hoisted his flag aboard the 74-gun and was promoted vice-admiral of the blue squadron. In August he shifted his flag to the newer and larger 80-gun and then once more in December to the first rate . Throughout this period he was in command of various divisions within the Channel Fleet. The Channel Fleet was responsible for preventing invasion from France and for the blockade of French Channel ports.\n\nOn 16 June 1795 he was in command of a small squadron that sighted a much larger French fleet. The ensuing action became famously known as \"The Retreat of Cornwallis.\"\n\nCornwallis was cruising near Brest with five ships of the line, \"Royal Sovereign\", , , , , two frigates and one cutter, , , when a French fleet of twelve sail of the line and fourteen large frigates appeared, commanded by Admiral Villaret Joyeuse. The odds being very greatly against him, he was compelled to order a retreat. But two of his ships were slow and unweatherly and fell behind the rest. The van of the French fleet began to catch the two slower British ships. The rearmost ship, \"Mars\", was caught and suffered severely in her rigging and was in danger of being surrounded by the French. Witnessing this, Cornwallis turned his squadron around to support her. The French admiral made the assumption that Cornwallis must have sighted assistance beyond his own field of vision and had turned to engage the enemy knowing that a superior force was nearby to come to their relief. The French admiral ordered his ships to disengage and Cornwallis and his small squadron retreated in order. The action is remarkable evidence of the moral superiority which the victory of the Glorious First of June, and the known efficiency of the British crews, had given to the Royal Navy. The reputation of Cornwallis was amplified and the praise given him was no doubt the greater because he was personally very popular with officers and men.\n\nIn 1796 Cornwallis incurred a court-martial (in consequence of a misunderstanding and apparently some temper on both sides) on the charge of refusing to obey an order from the Admiralty. He was practically acquitted. The substance of the case was that he demurred on the ground of health at being called upon to go to the West Indies, in a small frigate, and without \"comfort\".\n\nCornwallis was promoted admiral of the blue squadron in 1799 and held the Channel Command for a short interval when Admiral Jervis (Earl St. Vincent) fell ill in 1801. Cornwallis took command once more when Jervis stood down as commander and became first Lord of the Admiralty between 1801 and 1804. During this time Cornwallis was in charge of protecting the coast of the United Kingdom as Napoleon was building a large invasion force. Following Admiral Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, Cornwallis was removed from his post and Earl St. Vincent took his place.\n\nIn 1796, Cornwallis was promoted to Rear-Admiral of Great Britain, the title becoming Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom after the Act of Union came into force in 1801, and then in 1814 he was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom\n\nHis greatest honours might be considered to be his various nicknames among the sailors, \"Billy go tight\" (given on account of his rubicund complexion), as well as \"Billy Blue\", \"Coachee\", and \"Mr Whip\". Sailors appear to have only given nicknames to those commanders whom they liked. The various nicknames of Cornwallis seem to show that he was regarded with more of affection than reverence. Cornwallis was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1815.\n\nCornwallis served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eye during the periods, 1768–1774, 1782–1784, 1790–1800 and, 1801–1807. He also served as MP for Portsmouth from 1782 to 1790.\n\nCornwallis never married. In 1800 he leased and later purchased the Newlands estate in Milford on Sea in Hampshire. He was joined by his close friend and fellow naval officer Captain John Whitby and his wife Mary Anna Theresa Whitby. John Whitby died in 1806, but Mary and her infant daughter Theresa stayed on looking after Cornwallis into his old age. On Sir William Cornwallis' death in 1819, Mary Whitby and her daughter inherited his fortune.\n\n\n\n"}

Buttevant, Croom, Charleville, Mallow and Blarney are major towns along the route. A short section of the route (from Limerick to Patrickswell) is motorway standard and is designated as the M20 Motorway. \n\nThe route starts at junction 1 at the Rosbrien interchange (south of Limerick city) where it connects to the M7 and the N18 which together form the Limerick Southern Ring Road. The route continues from this interchange as motorway (see thumbnail). This route was redesignated as motorway in August 2009. The route bypasses Dooradoyle and Raheen, through which the old N20 route used to run until the early 2000s. Interchanges and link roads connect to these locations. Two further interchanges are located on the motorway, at either end of Patrickswell. At the latter, the N20 route leaves the main road (which continues as the N21 to Tralee), i.e. one must diverge from the motorway to stay on the N20.\n\nA wide two lane road brings traffic along the Croom bypass (prior to the opening of this bypass at a cost of €20 million on 12 July 2001, the route went through the town). Past this new section of road, narrow two-lane road commences, ending at Charleville. The route passes through the town, running along Main Street. The road between Charleville and the next town, Buttevant is of similar design. At Mallow a relatively high specification road is encountered, with an older bypass of the town (early 1990s) passing up the hill from it as dual carriageway. A viaduct brings the road across the Blackwater River and Valley. The rest of the route to Cork is of high quality wide two lane, with a section of 2+1 road (a pilot installation) south of Mallow. The route becomes dual carriageway on the approach to Cork. New relief roads in Cork bring the route into the city centre while avoiding the winding streets through which the route ran until around 2000.\n\nUnder the government's cancelled Transport 21 initiative, the Atlantic Corridor road project aimed to link Letterkenny to Waterford via Limerick and Cork with high quality roadway. A major part of this project involved the upgrading of the N20 route between Cork and Limerick.\n\nIt was proposed to upgrade or replace the entire N20 with a new M20 motorway, approximately in length, with up to eight newly constructed junctions or re-configured junctions. It was to be constructed in two stages: a southern section and a northern section. It is hoped that this project will be progressed as a PPP scheme. Details of progress on the scheme can be found on the Cork National Roads Office website.\n\nThe first segment of M20 motorway came into existence on 28 August 2009 following the approval by the Minister for Transport to redesignate a of existing N20 dual-carriageway between Rossbrien and Attyflin as motorway.\n\nOn 10 November 2011, owing to funding issues caused by the Irish financial crisis, the government announced that the planned completion of the M20 motorway is to be shelved for the foreseeable future, along with a number of other infrastructural projects.\n\nIn 2013, the National Roads Authority carried out an extensive upgrade of all directional road signage along the N20 national route, fuelling speculation that it will be some time before plans for a new motorway from Limerick to Cork are revisited.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced by the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that the new motorway is due to be built by 2023, projected to cost over €800 million. It has been described as one of the biggest infrastructure projects of its kind for many years in Ireland.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2299066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299066", "title": "Béla II of Hungary", "text": "Béla II of Hungary\n\nBéla the Blind (; ; ; 1109 – 13 February 1141) was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1131. He was blinded along with his rebellious father Álmos on the order of Álmos's brother, King Coloman of Hungary. Béla grew up in monasteries during the reign of Coloman's son Stephen II. The childless king arranged Béla's marriage with Helena of Rascia, who would become her husband's co-ruler throughout his reign.\n\nBéla was crowned king at least two months after the death of Stephen II, implying that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's suzerainty around 1136.\n\nBéla was the only son of Duke Álmosthe younger brother of King Coloman of Hungaryby his wife, Predslava of Kiev. Historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk write that Béla was born between 1108 and 1110.\nÁlmos devised several plots to dethrone his brother. In retaliation, the king deprived Álmos of his \"ducatus\" or \"duchy\" between 1105 and 1108. Álmos did not give up his ambitions and King Coloman had him and the child Béla blinded between 1112 and 1115 to secure a peaceful succession for his own son, Stephen. According to one of the two versions of these events recorded in the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", the king even ordered that Béla should be castrated but the soldier who was charged with this task refused to execute the order.\n\nAfter their blinding, Álmos lived in the monastery of Dömös, which he had founded. Kristó and Makk write that it is probable that Béla lived with his father in the monastery. The \"Annales Posonienses\" relates that \"the child was growing in the reign of King Coloman's son, Stephen\", who ascended the throne in 1116. Having hatched a failed plot against the king, Álmos left the monastery and fled to Constantinople in about 1125. For unknown reasons, Béla did not follow his father to the Byzantine Empire. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" narrates that he was kept \"concealed in Hungary from the fury\" of the king. Béla settled in the Pécsvárad Abbey, whose abbot sheltered him in secret.\n\nÁlmos died in exile on 1 September 1127. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", Béla's partisans \"revealed to the King, who believed him to have died after his blinding, that Béla was alive\". On hearing this, King Stephen II \"rejoiced with great joy, for he knew beyond doubt that he would have no heir\". The king even arranged Béla's marriage with Helena of Rascia and granted Tolna to the couple around 1129.\n\nKing Stephen II died in early 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as \"Tarih-i Üngürüs\" or \"The History of the Hungarians\"narrates that Béla ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had nominated as his heir had died. Béla II was crowned in Székesfehérvár on 28 April, substantiating the reliability of this report. However, no scholarly consensus on the exact circumstances of Béla's ascension exists. According to Gyula Kristó, Béla was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a civil war between his and Saul's partisans, but Pál Engel does not mention any conflict related to Béla's succession.\n\nBéla's blindness prevented him from administering his kingdom without assistance. He put his trust in his wife and her brother Beloš. Both royal and private charters from Béla's reign emphasize Queen Helena's pre-eminent role in the decision-making process, proving that the king regarded his wife as his co-ruler. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", at \"an assembly of the realm near Arad\" in early to mid-1131, Queen Helena ordered the slaughter of all noblemen who were accused of having suggested the blinding of her husband to King Coloman. Béla distributed the goods of the executed magnates between the newly established Arad Chapter and the early 11th-century Óbuda Chapter.\n\nBéla's was on good terms with the Holy Roman Empire, jeopardizing the interests of Boleslaw III of Poland who had been warring with the empire. The Polish monarch decided to support a pretender to the Hungarian crown named Boris. Boris was born to King Coloman's second wife Euphemia of Kiev after his mother was repudiated for adultery. After Boris arrived in Poland, a number of Hungarian noblemen joined him. Others sent messengers to Boris \"to invite him that he should come and with their help claim the kingdom for himself\", according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\".\n\nAccompanied by Polish and Rus' reinforcements, Boris broke into Hungary in mid-1132. Béla entered into an alliance with Leopold III, Margrave of Austria. Before launching a counter-attack against Boris, Béla convoked a council on the river Sajó. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" relates that the King asked \"the eminent men of Hungary\" who were present if they knew whether Boris \"was a bastard or the son of King Coloman\". The King's partisans attacked and murdered all those who proved to be \"disloyal and divided in their minds\" during the meeting. Boris, who thought that the majority of the Hungarian lords supported his claim, in vain sent one of his partisans to Béla's camp to incite the King's retinue to mutiny.\n\nBéla tried to persuade the Polish monarch to stop supporting the pretender. However, Boleslaw remained loyal to Boris. In the decisive battle, which was fought on the river Sajó on 22 July 1132, the Hungarian and Austrian troops defeated Boris and his allies.\n\nBoleslaw III of Poland could not assist Boris after the Battle of the Sajó. Béla's alliesSoběslav I of Bohemia and Volodimirko of Peremyshlinvaded Poland each year between 1132 and 1135. Soběslav regularlyin 1133, 1134, 1137, and 1139visited Béla's court. The Czech monarch even persuaded Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor to force Boleslaw III to abandon Boris and recognize Béla's rule in Hungary in August 1135.\n\nHungary adopted an expansionist policy after Boris's attempts to dethrone Béla. The chronicler Thomas the Archdeacon relates that Gaudius, who became Archbishop of Split in 1136, \"enjoyed great favor with the kings of Hungary\" and \"often visited their court\". The report suggests that Split accepted Béla II's suzerainty around 1136, but this interpretation of the sources is not universally accepted by historians. The exact circumstances surrounding the submission of Bosnia are unknown but the region seems to have accepted Béla's suzerainty without resistance by 1137. Historian John V. A. Fine writes that the northeastern regions of the province formed part of Queen Helena's dowry. The Hungarian army penetrated into the valley of the Rama River, a tributary of the Neretva River, in about 1137. Although Béla assumed the title King of Rama in token of the new conquest, the permanent occupation of the region is not proven.\n\nHungarian troops participated in a campaign launched by Grand Prince Yaropolk II of Kiev against Vsevolod of Kiev in 1139. Béla strengthened his alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. For this purpose, he gave financial support to Otto of Bamberg's missions among the Pomeranians and arranged the engagement of his daughter Sophia with Henry, son of the new German king Conrad III in June 1139.\n\nAccording to the Hungarian chronicles, in the last few years of his life Béla became a drunkard. His courtiers took advantage of his drunkenness to receive grants from him. When he was in an alcoholic stupor, he sometimes ordered the execution of innocent men. Béla died on 13 February 1141, \"on the Ides of February, a Thursday\". He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Cathedral.\n\nBéla married Helena of Rascia upon the initiation of his cousin, King Stephen II at the beginning of 1129. Helena was a daughter of Uroš I of Rascia and his wife Anna, whose origin is uncertain. Queen Helena gave birth to at least six children. The first of these, the future King Géza II of Hungary, was born in 1130. Three brothersLadislaus, Stephen and Álmoswere born in the early 1130s. Sophia, the first daughter of the royal couple, was born around 1135; she died as a nun in Admont Abbey after her engagement with Henry Berengar of Germany was broken. Béla II's youngest daughter, Elizabeth, who was born in about 1140, married Mieszko III of Poland.\n\nThe following family tree presents Béla's ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article.\n\n\"*Whether Géza's first or second wife was his children's mother is uncertain.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2299076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299076", "title": "River rejuvenation", "text": "River rejuvenation\n\nIn geomorphology a river is said to be rejuvenated when it is eroding the landscape in response to a lowering of its base level. The process is often a result of a sudden fall in sea level or the rise of land. The disturbance enables a rise in the river's potential energy, increasing its riverbed erosion rate. The erosion occurs as a means for the river to adjust to its new base level.\n\nRiver Rejuvenation can lead to a number of changes in landscape. These include the formation of waterfalls and rapids, Knick points, River Terraces and increased meanders. Rejuvenated terrains usually have complex landscapes because remnants of older landforms are locally preserved. Parts of floodplains may be preserved as terraces along the downcutting stream channels. Meandering streams often become entrenched, so a product of older river systems is found with steep, very pronounced \"V\" shaped valleys - often seen with younger systems. Also, it does not have the same pattern as an oxbow lake, although, it also could.\n\nOne example of rejuvenation is the Nile, which was rejuvenated when the Mediterranean Sea dried up in the late Miocene. Its base level dropped from sea level to over 2 miles below sea level. It cut its bed down to several hundred feet below sea level at Aswan and 8000 feet below sea level at Cairo. After the Mediterranean re-flooded, those gorges gradually filled with silt.\n\nRejuvenation may result from causes which are dynamic, eustatic or isostatic in nature. All of these cause the river to erode its bed vertically (downcutting) faster as it gains gravitational potential energy. That causes effects such as incised meanders, steps where the river suddenly starts flowing faster, and fluvial terraces derived from old floodplains.\n\nA region may be uplifted at any stage. This lowers the base level and streams begin active downward erosion again.\n\nDynamic rejuvenation may be caused by the epeirogenic uplift of a land mass. Warping or faulting of a drainage basin will steepen the stream gradient followed by the downcutting. The effect of seaward tilting can be felt immediately only when the direction of that stream is parallel to the direction of tilting.\n\nEustatic rejuvenation results from worldwide decrease in sea level, and two types of such rejuvenation are recognized. Diastrophic eustatism is the change in sea level due to variation in capacity of ocean basins, whereas glacio-eustatism is the change in sea level due to withdrawal or return of water into the oceans, due to the accumulation or melting of successive ice sheets.\n\nEustatic rejuvenation relocates the mouth of the stream. Regrading of a stream toward a new lower base level will proceed upvalley. The result may be an interrupted profile with the point of intersection of the old and new base levels.\n\nThree changes may bring static rejuvenation, to the stream.\n\nRejuvenation due to decrease in load took place during posts glacial times along many valleys that formerly received large quantities of glacial outwash. With change to no glacier conditions stream load decreased and valley deepening ensued.\n\nRejuvenation may result in a \"knickpoint\", as it appears on a river profile, which often appears as a rapids or a waterfall. An example is Seljalandsfoss in southern Iceland, where isostatic (dynamic) uplift has occurred as a result of both construction and deglaciation.\n\nStatic rejuvenation may also occur, in rare instances, when a downstream knickpoint erodes its way upstream to a lake which establishes base level for its tributaries. When the knickpoint reaches the lake, the lake drains, and the base level of upstream waters lowers rapidly from that of the (now former) lake to that of the river downstream of the knickpoint. At some point in the future, a quite dramatic example will appear when Niagara Falls cuts its way back to Lake Erie.\n\nCanyons and gorges are in the initial phase of valley development and are considered some of the most interesting valley forms. These forms result from accelerated entrenchment caused by recent tectonic activity such as especially vertical uplift. The uplift creates high-standing plateaus and as a result, perpetuates the downward erosive power of existing rivers.\n\nA knickpoint is an area in the landscape where there is an unexpected irregularity in the gradient of the river profile. An example of a visible knickpoint would be a waterfall. However, some knickpoints can be concealed In the landscape. It is important that while there are other contributing factors to such features in the landscape, rejuvenation is one of the major influences. As mentioned, when a river rejuvenates, it gains more energy and erodes vertically to meet its new base level. This change in profile is visible at the knickpoint where it is the area where the old base level connects to the new.\n\nA terrace is the product of an old floodplain that remains at a higher altitude precedent river rejuvenation. The newly formed terrace begins to cut back and form a valley. This valley widens through lateral erosion. The process continues gradually and if rejuvenation occurs repeatedly, new terraces form as well, resulting in a step like profile around a river.\n"}

{"id": "2299079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299079", "title": "Lottie Moon", "text": "Lottie Moon\n\nCharlotte Digges \"Lottie\" Moon (December 12, 1840 – December 24, 1912) was a Southern Baptist missionary to China with the Foreign Mission Board who spent nearly 40 years (1873–1912) living and working in China. As a teacher and evangelist she laid a foundation for traditionally solid support for missions among Southern Baptists, especially through its Woman's Missionary Union.\n\nMoon was born to affluent parents who were staunch Baptists, Anna Maria Barclay and Edward Harris Moon. She grew up to be 4 ft 3in (according to one account) on the family's ancestral tobacco plantation called Viewmont, near Scottsville, Virginia. Lottie was fourth in a family of five girls and two boys. Lottie was only thirteen when her father died in a riverboat accident.\n\nThe Moon family valued education, and at age fourteen Lottie went to school at the Baptist-affiliated Virginia Female Seminary (high school, later Hollins University) and Albemarle Female Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1861 Moon received one of the first Master of Arts degrees awarded to a woman by a southern institution. She learned Latin, Greek, French, and Italian. Later, she would become expert at Chinese.\n\nA spirited and outspoken girl, Lottie was indifferent to her Christian upbringing until her early teens. She underwent a spiritual awakening after a series of revival meetings on the college campus. John Broadus, one of the founders of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, led the revival meeting in 1858 where Moon experienced this awakening.\n\nAlthough educated females in the mid-19th century generally had few career opportunities, her older sister Orianna became a physician and served as a Confederate Army doctor during the American Civil War. Lottie helped her mother maintain the family estate during the war, and afterward began a teaching career. She taught at female academies, first in Danville, Kentucky. In Cartersville, Georgia, Moon and her friend, Anna Safford, opened Cartersville Female High School in 1871. Moon also joined the First Baptist Church and ministered to the impoverished families of Bartow County, Georgia.\n\nTo the family's surprise, Lottie's younger sister Edmonia accepted a call to go to North China as the first single woman Baptist missionary in 1872. By this time the Southern Baptist Convention had relaxed its policy against sending single women into the mission field, and Lottie soon felt called to follow her sister to China. On July 7, 1873, the Foreign Mission Board officially appointed 32-year-old Lottie as a missionary to China.\n\nLottie joined her sister Edmonia at the North China Mission Station in the treaty port of Dengzhou, in Shandong, (see Penglai, Perfecture City Yantai) and began her ministry by teaching in a boys school. (Edmonia had to return home a short time later for health reasons.) While accompanying some of the seasoned missionary wives on \"country visits\" to outlying villages, Lottie discovered her passion: direct evangelism. Most mission work at that time was done by married men, but the wives of China missionaries Tarleton Perry Crawford and Landrum Holmes had discovered an important reality: Only women could reach Chinese women. Lottie soon became frustrated, convinced that her talent was being wasted and could be better put to use in evangelism and church planting. She had come to China to \"go out among the millions\" as an evangelist, only to find herself relegated to teaching a school of forty \"unstudious\" children. She felt chained down, and came to view herself as part of an oppressed class - single women missionaries. Her writings were an appeal on behalf of all those who were facing similar situations in their ministries. In an article titled \"The Woman's Question Again,\" published in 1883, Lottie wrote:\n\nLottie waged a slow but relentless campaign to give women missionaries the freedom to minister and have an equal voice in mission proceedings. A prolific writer, she corresponded frequently with H. A. Tupper, head of the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, informing him of the realities of mission work and the desperate need for more workers—both women and men.\n\nIn 1885, at the age of 45, Moon gave up teaching and moved into the interior to evangelize full-time in the areas of P'ingtu and Hwangshien. Her converts numbered in the hundreds. Continuing a prolific writing campaign, Moon's letters and articles poignantly described the life of a missionary and pleaded the \"desperate need\" for more missionaries, which the poorly funded board could not provide. She encouraged Southern Baptist women to organize mission societies in the local churches to help support additional missionary candidates, and to consider coming themselves. Many of her letters appeared as articles in denominational publications. Then, in 1887, Moon wrote to the \"Foreign Mission Journal\" and proposed that the week before Christmas be established as a time of giving to foreign missions. Catching her vision, Southern Baptist women organized local Women's Missionary Societies and even Sunbeam Bands for children to promote missions and collect funds to support missions. Lottie moon was instrumental in the founding of The Woman's Missionary Union, an auxiliary to the Southern Baptist Convention, in 1888. The first \"Christmas offering for missions\" in 1888 collected over $3,315, enough to send three new missionaries to China.\nIn 1892, Moon took a much needed furlough in the US, and did so again in 1902. She was very concerned that her fellow missionaries were burning out from lack of rest and renewal and going to early graves. The mindset back home was \"go to the mission field, die on the mission field.\" Many never expected to see their friends and families again. Moon argued that regular furloughs every ten years would extend the lives and effectiveness of seasoned missionaries.\n\nThroughout her missionary career, Moon faced plague, famine, revolution, and war.\nThe First Sino-Japanese War (1894), the Boxer Rebellion (1900) and the Chinese Nationalist uprising (which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911) all profoundly affected mission work. Famine and disease took their toll, as well. When Moon returned from her second furlough in 1904, she was deeply struck by the suffering of the people who were literally starving to death all around her. She pleaded for more money and more resources, but the mission board was heavily in debt and could send nothing. Mission salaries were voluntarily cut. Unknown to her fellow missionaries, Moon shared her personal finances and food with anyone in need around her, severely affecting both her physical and mental health. In 1912, she only weighed 50 pounds. Alarmed, fellow missionaries arranged for her to be sent back home to the United States with a missionary companion. However, Moon died en route at the age of 72, on December 24, 1912, in the harbor of Kobe, Japan.\n\nHer body was cremated and the remains returned to her family in Crewe, Virginia, for burial.\n\nRumors characterize Moon's relationship with Crawford Howell Toy, a former teacher who became a controversial figure among Southern Baptists in the late 19th century, as romantic. Moon first met Toy at the Albemarle Female Institute. Lottie—who previously learned Latin, Greek, French, Italian and Spanish and would become the one of the first women to earn a master's degree in languages—studied Hebrew and English grammar under Toy's tutelage. Toy wrote of Moon, \"She writes the best English I have ever been privileged to read.\" While some contend Toy proposed to Moon before the Civil War, her mention of a marriage proposal from Toy dates from 1881. In the interim, Toy supported the Confederacy and became a professor of Old Testament studies at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, while Moon aided her mother on their Virginia estate.\n\nHowever, following controversies concerning Darwinism and Toy's criticism of some Baptists' Christological Old Testament interpretations, Toy submitted his resignation from Southern in 1879. Moon's 1881 correspondence with FMB secretary H. A. Tupper, mentions her plans for a spring wedding with Toy, who was by then teaching Old Testament and religion at Harvard University. However, the engagement was broken and their marriage never occurred, with vague mentions of religious reasons. Toy's controversial new beliefs regarding the Bible, as well as Moon's commitment to remain in China doing mission work for Southern Baptists seem involved. Toy ultimately broke his affiliation with Southern Baptists and became a Unitarian.\n\nMoon is honored together with Henry Budd with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on December 22.\n\nLottie Moon has come to personify the missionary spirit for Southern Baptists and many other Christians as well. The annual Lottie Moon Christmas Offering for International Missions has raised a total of $1.5 billion for missions since 1888, and finances half the international missions budget of the Southern Baptist Convention every year.\n\nIn terms of feminist historiography, Regina Sullivan argues that the decision of the Southern Baptists to allow women to engage in foreign mission work fit in well with the Protestant expectation that women ought to be the most pious members of society, influencing men to lead moral lives. However Moon was impatient with the usual restraints, and deliberately moved her China mission out of reach of male authority. Furthermore, she went so far as to persuade Southern Baptist women to form their own missionary organizations. However, Moon's feminist leadership was not followed by women back home. The women of the Women's Missionary Union manipulated her record to make her appear a martyr to the Christian cause rather than a feminist voice within the Baptist Church. In historical reality, Sullivan emphasizes, Moon was a pioneer for gender equality; as she wrote from China in 1893, \"What women have a right to demand is perfect equality.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Riley demonstrates quite a bit of enthusiasm and new strength while fighting, while Buffy simply orders Spike to stay out of her way. As Buffy and Riley leave, Spike swears to taste Buffy's blood, but as he walks off, he falls into an open grave. Buffy and Willow debate over a topic from class and discuss Buffy's busy schedule.\n\nBuffy arrives at The Magic Box to train and is pleasantly surprised to see that the backroom has been transformed into an amazing training room. Harmony seeks Spike and his help because she is frightened that Buffy is out to destroy her. The two conspire to kill the Slayer. Joyce is chatting while making breakfast for Dawn, and in the midst of a sentence suddenly asks, \"Who are you?\" before collapsing onto the floor.\n\nAt the hospital, an intern informs Buffy and Riley that Joyce will be fine, but that doctors aren't sure what caused her to collapse. Dawn is playing with a stethoscope and when she listens to Riley's heart, she finds that it is racing much faster than normal. After listening to Riley's heart, a doctor recommends that he stay in the hospital, as tachycardia puts him at high risk of a heart attack, but Riley disregards their concerns. Buffy tries to think of a way to help Riley and finally resolves to go to Riley's place and contact The Initiative via the bugs in his room.\n\nStill part of the government, Graham tries to force Riley to see a doctor, but Riley is stronger than Graham and the other agents and gets away. After speaking with Graham later that day, Buffy takes it upon herself to get Riley to a doctor before he dies. Buffy gives Spike information about the doctor that can help Riley hoping that the vampire could help find Riley and bring him there. Instead, Spike and Harmony kidnap the doctor in order to force him to remove Spike's chip.\n\nBuffy finds Riley in the Initiative caves, punching into rock because he can't feel any pain. He tells her that he's afraid he won't be enough for her once he lets the doctors operate on him. After convincing Riley to get medical attention, Buffy brings him to the hospital and finds Dr. Overheiser gone. Just after Overheiser finishes sewing up Spike's skull, Buffy arrives with Riley and a fight ensues. As he tries to bite the Slayer, Spike finds that the doctor only pretended to remove the chip from his head. When Riley suffers a heart attack and collapses while fighting Harmony, Buffy and the doctor immediately turn their attention to him. With the humans distracted, an enraged Spike escapes with Harmony, ranting about his disgust with Buffy and his weariness with how she is seemingly the source of everything wrong with his life.\n\nThe doctor is able to operate successfully on Riley. Later, Graham talks with Riley and tells him he no longer has a purpose in Sunnydale. Without the Initiative, he's nothing.\n\nAfterwards, Buffy goes to Spike's crypt with the intention of staking him; however, when she confronts him, he angrily tells her to kill him. Spike angrily berates Buffy as the source of his torment, and yells that he would rather die and be free of her: however, Buffy cannot bring herself to do it and the pair kiss. Suddenly Spike wakes up beside a still sleeping Harmony; he's merely suffered a nightmare, but Spike is mortified at the thought he has feelings for Buffy.\n\n\n\n"}

She was named for George Hampton Yarborough, Jr.\n\n\"Yarborough\" was laid down on 27 February 1919 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Union Iron Works plant; launched on 20 June 1919; sponsored by Miss Kate Burch, the fiancee of the late Lt. Yarborough; designated DD-314 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 31 December 1920, Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Rosendahl —later the Navy's pre-eminent authority on airships — in command.\n\nFollowing commissioning, \"Yarborough\" was fitted out at Mare Island into late January 1921 and departed the yard on the 25th, bound for Port Richmond, California, where she fueled. After trials in San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, and San Pedro Bay, the new destroyer tied up at the Reserve Dock at San Diego, California, on 2 February. Outside a trip to San Pedro with liberty parties embarked, the ship remained pierside through mid-April.\n\nOne event was noteworthy during the ship's largely port-bound routine in 1921. She embarked Marine detachments from the cruisers and , both units under the command of 1st Lt. J. K. Martensteen, USMC, and transported them to Santa Catalina Island on 18 April. Underway from San Diego at 0615 on the 18th, she stood into Isthmus Cove, Santa Catalina Island at 1145, anchoring at 1205. After landing the marines, she got underway and hove to briefly to embark a passenger - Capt. Franck T. Evans, the chief of staff to Commander, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet and the son of the famous admiral Robley D. (\"Fighting Bob\") Evans - before she resumed her passage. Unfortunately, \"Yarborough\" collided with a buoy at the entrance to San Pedro harbor - an embarrassing occurrence in view of the ship's high-ranking passenger. Fortunately, the ship sustained only minor damage to a propeller blade, and no disciplinary action was taken.\n\n\"Yarborough\" remained alongside the Santa Fe dock at San Diego until 30 June, when she headed for the Mare Island Navy Yard. After a drydocking, the destroyer ran trials off the southern California coast, during which she shipped heavy seas over the forecastle that caused some damage to her bridge on 11 July. Visiting San Francisco briefly, the destroyer returned to San Diego on the 13th, where she remained into mid-October.\n\n\"Yarborough\" subsequently ran gunnery exercises and drills in company with her sistership late in October, after receiving on board a large draft of men from . \"Yarborough\" apparently joined the operating segment of the \"rotating reserves\" at that point because the rest of her career was largely one of operational activity.\n\nShe spent the majority of 1922 operating from San Diego, touching at ports in the Pacific Northwest like Port Angeles and Seattle, Washington, and familiar California ports like San Diego and San Pedro. Upon occasion, she operated with the battleship forces and conducted drills and exercises in antisubmarine screening, torpedo firings, and, of course, the staple, gunnery.\n\nThe following year, however, \"Yarborough\" began her voyages beyond what had become the usual west coast routine. After maneuvers out of San Pedro with the Battle Fleet, \"Yarborough\" departed that port on 9 February 1923, bound for Magdalena Bay, Mexico. Arriving there on the 6th, in company with Destroyer Squadrons 11 and 12 and the destroyer tender , she was underway again two days later this time bound for Panama.\n\nIn the succeeding days that February, \"Yarborough\" took part in the first of the large United States Fleet exercises - Fleet Problem I. Staged off the coast of Panama, Fleet Problem I pitted the Battle Fleet against an augmented Scouting Fleet. \"Yarborough\" screened the Battle Fleet's dreadnoughts, often serving as a picket in a special defensive screen arrangement ahead of the heavy units. The exercise continued into March; and, during a lull in the maneuvers, Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby, embarked in , reviewed the assembled forces on 14 March.\n\nAfter further exercises, \"Yarborough\" departed the Panama area on 31 March as part of the screen for the northward-bound battleships. She arrived at San Diego on 11 April. For the remainder of the year, her schedule remained routine, operations within the vicinity of San Diego, San Francisco, or San Pedro, with a period under repairs at Mare Island and dry-docked on a marine railway at San Diego.\n\nOn 2 January 1924, \"Yarborough\" got underway for Panama to participate in the next series of fleet exercises - Fleet Problems II, III, and IV - conducted concurrently. Problem II simulated the first leg of a westward advance across the Pacific; Problem III tested the Caribbean defenses and the transit facilities of the Panama Canal; and Problem IV simulated the movement from a main base in the western Pacific to the Japanese home islands—represented in that case by islands, cities, and countries surrounding the Caribbean.\n\n\"Yarborough's\" role in the maneuvers was similar to those she had performed before. However, there was one exception because, during one phase of the exercises, she operated with —the Navy's first aircraft carrier. She screened Langley on 25 January and witnessed an air attack upon the ship by planes of the \"black\" fleet. The destroyer also performed those tasks for which she had been designed (torpedo attacks and screening maneuvers) both with and against battleships. \"Yarborough\" and her sister-ships participated in the intensive exercises through late February, after which the destroyer paid a brief call upon New Orleans, Louisiana, her only visit ever to that port, between 1 March and 11 March.\n\nAfter further exercises off Puerto Rico, \"Yarborough\" headed for home; transited the Panama Canal on 8 April; and arrived at San Diego on the 22d. For the remainder of the year, she operated in and around her home port.\n\nThe Scouting Fleet once more \"battled\" the Battle Fleet in March 1925, in Fleet Problem V, off the coast of Baja California. After that series of exercises which trained the Fleet in protective screening, seizing and occupying an unfortified anchorage, fueling at sea, and conducting submarine attacks, the Fleet set its course westward.\n\n\"Yarborough\" departed San Francisco as part of this movement on 15 April 1925. Her log noted: \"underway in company with the United States Fleet to engage in joint Army and Navy Problem No. 3 and proceed to the Hawaiian Islands.\" Screening Battleship Division 5, as a unit of Destroyer Division 34, she proceeded via Mamala Bay, Oahu, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 April. When the Fleet later concentrated in Lahaina Roads, Maui, \"Yarborough\" served a brief tour as guardship, patrolling off the entrance to the Fleet anchorage.\n\nDuring subsequent maneuvers out of Lahaina, \"Yarborough\" and her mates performed as \"Cruiser Division 1\" for the sake of the exercise, acting in that guise from 19 May to 29 May, before returning to Pearl Harbor for upkeep.\n\nAfter visiting Hilo, \"Yarborough\" departed Pearl Harbor on 1 July 1925, bound for the South Pacific as part of the Fleet's Australian cruise. \"Yarborough\" subsequently visited Pago Pago, Samoa, from 10 July to 11 July; Melbourne, Australia, from 23 July to 30 July; Lyttelton, New Zealand, from 11 August to 21 August; and Wellington, New Zealand, from 22 August to 24 August. Returning via Pago Pago, \"Yarborough\" and her division mates were pressed into service on 7 September as part of the dragnet searching for the downed PN-9 No. 1 - a flying boat which attempted to make a flight from the west coast to Hawaii. Destroyer Division 34's ships steamed at eight-mile (13 km) intervals in a scouting line and searched over the next three days before word reached them that PN-9 No. 1 had been found, her crew having stripped the plane's lower wings and used the fabric to rig a sail that had taken them close to Oahu.\n\n\"Yarborough\" eventually returned via Pearl Harbor to San Diego on 19 September and remained in the vicinity of her home port for the remainder of 1925. Early the following year, 1926, she took part in Fleet Problem VI, off the west coast of Central America, operating with the Battle Fleet and its train convoy against the \"enemy\" forces as represented by the Scouting Fleet and Control Force. \"Yarborough\" later visited Port Aberdeen, Port Angeles, Washington, and the Puget Sound Navy Yard before she rounded out the year operating locally from San Diego.\n\nThe year 1927 proved to be a busy one for \"Yarborough\", one that she began, as usual, at San Diego. Departing that port on 17 February, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 5 March, Atlantic-bound. The loss of the German steamship , however, forced a change in plans. \"Yarborough\" re-transited the canal four days later, on 9 March, and headed for the Galápagos Islands in company with the rest of Destroyer Division 34. Forming a scouting line, the flush-deckers combed the seas for survivors of the \"Albatross\". During the search, \"Yarborough\" often operated in sight of her sisterships and but found nothing. Abandoning the search on the 13th, the ship retransmitted the canal and rejoined the Fleet.\n\nParticipating in Fleet Problem VII later that month, \"Yarborough\" operated off Gonaïves, Haiti, and visited Staten Island and New York late in May and early in June. While in the New York area, the destroyer participated in the presidential review, when President Calvin Coolidge inspected the Fleet from the decks of his presidential yacht, \"Mayflower\", on 4 June.\n\n\"Yarborough\" subsequently headed for Panama, arriving at Colon on 9 June. She shifted to Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, soon thereafter, due to an outbreak of unrest there. She joined and in guarding American interests in that port before heading back to Colon, retransiting the Panama Canal, and undergoing a drydocking at Balboa. She returned to Puerto Cabezas on 9 July and found and \"Shirk\" in port.\n\n\"Yarborough\" remained at Puerto Cabezas into early August, drilling her landing force in light marching order early in the deployment to be ready for any emergency. The destroyer sailed for the Panama Canal on 5 August, transited the canal on the 7th, and arrived at San Diego on the 23rd. She exercised out of San Diego and off San Clemente Island for the rest of 1927.\n\nThe following spring, \"Yarborough\" again operated in Hawaiian waters, taking part in Fleet Problem VIII which was staged between San Francisco and Honolulu. Returning to the west coast upon completion of that group of maneuvers, the destroyer continued her regular schedule of operations in tactics and gunnery out of Port Angeles, San Diego, and San Pedro.\n\n\"Yarborough\" participated in her final large-scale maneuvers in January 1929, operating between San Diego and the westward side of the Panama Canal Zone, in Fleet Problem IX. That problem - significant in that the new aircraft carrier participated in the Fleet's war games for the first time - pitted the Battle Fleet (less submarines and \"Lexington\") against a combination of forces including the Scouting Force (augmented by \"Lexington\"), the Control Forces, Train Squadron 1, and 15th Naval District and local Army defense forces. The scenario studied the effects of an attack upon the Panama Canal and conducted the operations necessary to carry out such an eventuality. As before, \"Yarborough's\" role was with the Battle Fleet, screening the dreadnoughts of the battle line.\n\nAfter alternating periods in port and operating locally, \"Yarborough\" was moored at the Destroyer Base at San Diego that autumn and prepared for decommissioning. Simultaneously, she participated in the reactivation of ships that had been in reserve during the past few years. Two of those ships were and .\n\n\"Yarborough\" was decommissioned on 29 May 1930; and, on 3 November 1930, her name was struck from the Navy List. Scrapped on 20 December of the same year, her remains were sold as scrap metal on 25 February 1932.\n\nAs of 2019, no other ships have been named \"Yarborough\".\n\n"}

While Whitehouse sent the first telegraph communications in 16 August 1858 to the United States of America, he was ultimately held responsible for the undersea cable failure after he applied higher voltages in an effort to boost declining signals.\n\nBorn in Liverpool to a merchant, he qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1840 and established a successful practice in Brighton.\n\nIn the 1850s, Whitehouse conducted experiments that, he held, showed that feared problems with practical data rates on underwater cables would not prohibit a commercial service. Though his claims were disputed by William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin), he was an able propagandist for the proponents of a proposed transatlantic cable.\nCyrus West Field recruited Whitehouse as chief electrician to the Atlantic Telegraph Company; Thomson subsequently became scientific advisor, convinced that Whitehouse's theories were wrong but believing him to have the practical skill to make the scheme work. When the cable finally opened for business, it was beset with the problems that Thomson had foreseen.\n\nWhitehouse's inadequate apparatus had to be replaced by Thomson's more sensitive mirror galvanometer but Whitehouse then ruined the cable by delivering massive shocks of 2,000 volts in an attempt to rectify the problems. Whitehouse continually maintained that the cable and his equipment were a success. Though he put up a desperate public defence of his conduct and was more than ready to apportion blame among all other parties, an 1861 enquiry concluded that he should bear the majority of the responsibility. It has been argued that the manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.\n\nWhitehouse was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, founding member of the Society of Telegraphic Engineers, and a member of the Royal Institution, the Royal Meteorological Society, the Physical Society, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n\n"}

The rites of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and some Lutheran churches employ an oblation: gifts of bread and wine are offered to God. \n\nLiturgically speaking, there are two oblations: the lesser oblation, sometimes known as the offertory, in which the bread and wine, as yet unconsecrated, are presented and offered to God, and the greater oblation, the oblation proper, in which the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to God, the Father.\n\nThe word oblate is also an ecclesiastical term for persons who have devoted themselves or have been devoted as children by their parents to a monastic life. Oblate is more familiar in the Roman Catholic Church as the name of a Religious Congregation of secular or diocesan priests, the Oblate Fathers of St. Charles. They are placed under the absolute authority of the bishop of the diocese in which they are established and can be employed by him on any duties he may think fit. This congregation was founded in 1578 under the name of Oblates of the Blessed Virgin and St. Ambrose by St. Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan.\n\nA similar congregation of secular priests, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, was founded at Marseilles in 1815.\n\nIn Catholicism, annualia were a specific type of oblation made for a deceased person by their family, though sources disagree on the nature of the offering. The 1728 \"Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" defines the annualia as a solemn Mass celebrated yearly on the date of the deceased person's death. Other sources state that the annualia was a series of Masses performed each day for a year on behalf of the deceased, at the behest of their family, who would pay a stipend to the clergy member performing the rites. The annualia could be extended to a triennial (daily mass for three years) or shortened to a trental (daily mass for thirty days) depending on the needs of the family.\n\n \n"}

After instruction at the Marine Barracks, Parris Island, South Carolina, he reported to the Marine Barracks at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 4, 1917 for duty with the 16th Company, 5th Regiment of Marines. Taken to New York in \"Seattle\" (Armored Cruiser No. 11), Yarborough embarked in \"Henderson\" (Transport No. 1) on June 14, 1917 sailed for France that day; and reached St. Nazaire on the 27th of June.\n\nYarborough, promoted to first lieutenant on August 11, 1917, served two tours of detached duty while assigned to the 5th Regiment, first at Cosne, France, between December 8, 1917 and January 4, 1918 and then at Gondrecourt, France, between February 22, and April 29, 1918.\n\nOn June 23, 1918, the height of the Battle of Belleau Wood, Lt. Yarborough arrived on the front lines. The next day, intense enemy fire from skillfully placed machine guns pinned down Yarborough's unit—a platoon in a support position in the American lines. The young lieutenant dashed from one shell hole to another, in the open, steadying his men, until a burst of machine gun fire hit him. Severely wounded, he refused aid until other wounded men in his unit received medical attention. Finally moved to shelter, he succumbed to his severe gunshot wounds on June 26, 1918. Cited for his bravery, First Lieutenant Yarborough received the Distinguished Service Cross and Navy Cross, posthumously.\n\nThe United States Navy named the destroyer USS Yarborough (DD-314) for him.\n"}

Decarburization occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 °C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surfaces which are in contact with the decarburizing gas.\n\nDecarburization can be either advantageous or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both something that can be done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step).\n\nThe decarburization mechanism can be described as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel.\n\nThe most common reactions are:\n\nalso called the Boudouard reaction\n\nOther reactions are\n\nElectrical steel is one material that uses decarburization in its production. To prevent the atmospheric gases from reacting with the metal itself, electrical steel is annealed in an atmosphere of nitrogen, hydrogen, and water vapor, where oxidation of the iron is specifically prevented by the proportions of hydrogen and water vapor so that the only reacting substance is carbon being made into carbon monoxide.\n\nStainless steel contains additives which are highly oxidizable, such as chromium and molybdenum. Such steels can only be decarburized by reacting with dry hydrogen, which has no water content, unlike wet hydrogen, which is produced in a way that includes some water and can otherwise be used for decarburization.\n\nIncidental decarburization can be detrimental to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative carburization, which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into the surface of the material during annealing. The decarburized surface material can also be removed by grinding.\n\n\n"}

Services are currently provided by Northern Trains, who also manage the station.\n\nThe station originally opened in January 1909, and was situated on a section of line built by the North Eastern Railway, to link the lines over the newly commissioned King Edward VII Bridge with the original 1837 Newcastle & Carlisle Railway freight route to Redheugh and the Dunston coal staithes.\n\nIt was originally known as Dunston-on-Tyne, and served as the terminus of a shuttle service from Newcastle. This service ended on in May 1926, as a result of the General Strike of 1926, and the station was closed.\n\nIt was very briefly brought back into use for special evacuation trains during World War II, but remained closed throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s.\n\nIn October 1982, trains were routed through Dunston, due to the closure of Scotswood Bridge, and the station was officially re-opened by British Rail on 1 October 1984.\n\nInitially, most services on the Tyne Valley Line services called at Dunston. Service frequency was later reduced, due to low passenger numbers, particularly following the opening of Metrocentre in August 1987.\n\nThe station is unmanned, and only has basic amenities, including a single waiting shelter on the island platform, timetable poster boards and a customer help point at the station entrance. There are no ticketing facilities at the station, therefore tickets must be bought in advance or on the train. Step-free access is available by means of an inclined ramp from the station entrance on Ellison Road.\n\nPrior to the December 2013 timetable change, the station was served by four daily services (Monday to Saturday), with no service running from the station on a Sunday. Two operated in the direction of Newcastle (with one continuing on to Nunthorpe), and a further two in the direction of Metrocentre (with one continuing on to Hexham).\n\nThe timetable change in December 2013 brought about significant improvements, with the station seeing its best level of service since the late 1980s. An hourly service operated daily between Newcastle and Metrocentre (with some services continuing on to Hexham).\n\nAs of the December 2019 timetable change, Northern Trains operate an hourly service (Monday to Saturday) between Hexham and Nunthorpe, with additional trains also calling at the station during the morning and evening peak. On a Sunday, an hourly service operates between Metrocentre and Newcastle, with a two-hourly service continuing to Morpeth.\n"}
{"id": "2299127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299127", "title": "N2 (South Africa)", "text": "N2 (South Africa)\n\nThe N2 is a national route in South Africa that runs from Cape Town through Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban to Ermelo. It is the main highway along the Indian Ocean coast of the country. Its total distance of makes it the longest numbered route in South Africa.\n\nMajor towns and cities along the route of the N2 include Cape Town, Somerset West, Caledon, Swellendam, Mossel Bay, George, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Humansdorp, Port Elizabeth, Makhanda, King William's Town, Bhisho, East London, Mthatha, Kokstad, Port Shepstone, Durban, KwaDukuza and Empangeni.\n\nThe N2 begins in central Cape Town at the northern end of Buitengracht Street outside the entrance to the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. The first section of the N2 is shared with the beginning of the N1; it is a four-lane elevated freeway that runs along a strip of land between the city centre and the Port of Cape Town. On the eastern edge of the city centre the two roads split, and the N2 turns south as Nelson Mandela Boulevard, crossing above the yards and approach tracks of Cape Town railway station.\n\nThe N2 descends to ground level in Woodstock before approaching the major interchange known as \"Hospital Bend\" because of its proximity to Groote Schuur Hospital. In this interchange, the N2 and the M3 merge to form a massive 10-lane freeway before diverging again. Because Hospital Bend is built on a steeply sloping curve, and lane-changing is often necessary to travel through the intersection, it was notorious for congestion and accidents, until it was upgraded between 2008 and 2010. \n\nAfter Hospital Bend the N2 turns east to travel across the Cape Flats as a 6-lane freeway to Somerset West; this section is known as Settler's Way. Along this route it crosses the M5, M7 and R300 freeways; it also travels just past the end of the main runway at Cape Town International Airport. In Somerset West it is reduced to an undivided highway, passing through several intersections with traffic lights, which cause frequent congestion.\n\nEast of Somerset West the N2 climbs Sir Lowry's Pass to enter the Overberg region. It passes near the town of Grabouw on the Hottentots-Holland plateau before descending the Houwhoek Pass to Botrivier. After Botrivier it passes across the agricultural plains through the towns of Caledon, Riviersonderend, Swellendam and Riversdale to re-approach the coast at Mossel Bay, which marks the beginning of the Garden Route.\nJust west of Mossel Bay the N2 again becomes a divided freeway, and remains one as far as the intersection with the N9/N12 just outside George. From there it travels across Kaaiman's Pass (see below) to Wilderness and on to Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. After Plettenberg Bay a section of the road is tolled as the Tsitsikamma Toll Route, primarily because of the Bloukrans Bridge; an alternative route used to run through Nature's Valley but this is no longer available due to flood damage. The Bloukrans Bridge marks the border with the Eastern Cape and is the site of the world's highest bridge bungy, Bloukrans Bridge Bungy.\n\nIn the Eastern Cape the N2 passes near Humansdorp and Jeffrey's Bay before becoming a four-lane divided freeway through the city of Port Elizabeth, ending at Colchester. The N2 continues in a north-easterly direction from Port Elizabeth, moving away from the coast towards Makhanda; en route the N10 splits from the N2, going northwards towards Middelburg and eventually Namibia. After Grahamstown the N2 passes through the former Ciskei; at King William's Town it turns back towards the coast, meeting it at East London. The N2 passes around East London on a bypass; it meets the N6 which runs northwards from East London towards Queenstown and Bloemfontein.\n\nAfter East London, the N2 turns again towards the interior in a northeasterly direction to avoid the difficult terrain of the Wild Coast. It passes through the former Transkei and its former capital Mthatha. Near Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal the N2 crosses into the province of KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nAt Kokstad the N2 meets the R56 from Matatiele and makes a hard right towards the coast. The R56 separates from the N2 at Stafford's Post, running in a northeasterly direction past Umzimkhulu, Ixopo and Richmond towards Pietermaritzburg. The R56 can be used as an alternative to avoid the toll plaza at Port Shepstone, and one can follow the R56 to Pietermaritzburg, and then using the N3 from Pietermaritzburg to Hillcrest, where one can use the M13 as an alternative to Durban. The N2 eventually meets the coast at Port Shepstone, and is tolled once again. This is also the point where the R61 ends, providing an alternative route to Mthatha through the Wild Coast and eventually Cape Town via Beaufort West and the N1. From Port Shepstone it runs as a freeway past the resort towns of the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, including Umzumbe, Hibberdene, Ifafa Beach, Scottburgh, Umkomaas and Amanzimtoti, before passing on a 3 lane bypass around the city of Durban. At the Westville EB Cloete Interchange, the N2 meets the N3 which heads northwest toward Johannesburg. Major upgrades have been made to existing interchanges with the M19 Umgeni Road Interchange, the bridge over the Umgeni River and the M41 Mount Edgecombe/Umhlanga Rocks Interchange.\n\nAfter Durban, the N2 runs as a toll freeway passing through Umhlanga Rocks, Ballito and Tongaat. The N2 runs close to King Shaka International Airport and a tolled off-ramp provides access to the airport. It is tolled twice before the freeway section ends at KwaDukuza (formerly Stanger), once at Tongaat and again before KwaDukuza. It then continues as a single carriageway with two lanes on both sides and passes through sugar cane plantations on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast. It is tolled once again, and for the final time at Mtunzini and meets the R34 which provides access to Richards Bay to the east and Empangeni and Ulundi to the west. The 34 km stretch of the N2 between Mtunzini and Empangeni is being upgraded to a dual carriageway. After Richards Bay, the N2 turns north, moving away from the coast into the heart of Zululand, where it bypasses Greater St Lucia Wetlands Park to the west and runs past the town of Mkuze before running close to the border of Eswatini, passing the town of Pongola.\n\nAfter leaving Pongola, the N2 makes a direct line for Piet Retief and meets the R33 that links Piet Retief and Pietermaritzburg via Vryheid which is 370 kilometres away. It then heads for Ermelo where it eventually terminates where it meets the N11 at the corner of Voortrekkerlaan and De Emigratie Street in the town centre.\n\nThe total length of the road is 2255 kilometres.\n\nHeavy rains triggered a mud-slide on the Kaaiman's pass section of the N2 between George and Wilderness. This caused the road to be temporarily closed from 26 August 2006. As a result of the slide a section of roadway sagged and large cracks appeared on the road surface. After an inspection by a team of engineers a single lane was reopened on 29 August for vehicles with a gross mass of under 5000 kg.\n\nAn alternative route following the Saasveld road was put into use, but this road only allows for a single lane of traffic and light vehicles. Heavy vehicles have to take an alternative route via the R62 and Langkloof pass effectively lengthening the distance from George to Wilderness from 11 km to over 600 km (news24.com story). The road has since reopened but major repairs are being done.\n\nTraffic on the N2 has also been disrupted on numerous occasions because of protests. On 10 September 2007, residents of Joe Slovo Informal Settlement blockaded the N2 Freeway in Cape Town near Langa. Police responded with rubber bullets injuring over 30 residents. On 4 December 2008, a few thousand residents of eMachambini, between KwaDukuza and Richards Bay in KZN, blockaded the N2 Freeway in protest against the proposed AmaZulu World Themepark. Police opened fire and injured about 23 residents and arrested about 10.\n\nOn 20 October 2012, a section of the N2 was closed after heavy rainfall caused a collapse about 20 km outside Grahamstown.\n\n"}

It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award in the year 2000 and has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. It was also chosen as \"The New Yorker\"'s Best Debut of the Year and is on Oprah Winfrey's Top Ten Book List.\n\nThe stories are about the lives of Indians and Indian Americans who are caught between their roots and the \"New World\".\n\nA married couple, Shukumar and Shoba, live as strangers in their house until an electrical outage brings them together when all of sudden \"they [are] able to talk to each other again\" in the four nights of darkness. From the point of view of Shukumar, we are given bits and pieces of memory which slowly gives insight into what has caused the distance in the marriage. For a brief moment, it seems the distance is nothing but perhaps a result of a disagreement. However, descriptions of Shukumar and Shoba's changed physical appearances begin to hint at something much more than a lovers’ quarrel. We soon find out that both characters’ worn outward appearance results from their internal, emotional strife that has caused such deeply woven alienation from each other.\n\nThe husband and wife mourn for their stillborn baby. This traumatic loss casts a tone of melancholia for the rest of the story. However, there is some hope for the couple to reconnect as during each night of blackness, they confess more and more to each other—the things that were never uttered as man and woman. A late night drink with a friend, a ripped out photo from a magazine, and anguish over a sweater vest are all confessions made in the nightly blackouts. Shukumar and Shoba become closer as the secrets combine into a knowledge that seems like the remedy to mend the enormous loss they share together. On the fourth night, we are given the most hope at their reconnection when they \"mak[e] love with a desperation they had forgotten.\"\n\nBut just as to be stillborn is to have never begun life, so too does the couple's effort to rekindle their marriage fail at inception. One last confession is given first by Shoba, then another by Shukumar at the end of \"A Temporary Matter\". In full confidence with one another, they acknowledge the finality in the loss of their marriage. And finally, \"They weep for the things they now knew.\"\n\nMr. Pirzada is a botany professor from Dhaka and is living in New England for the year after receiving a research grant from the Pakistani Government; he has left behind his wife and seven daughters, who he has not contacted in months. Because his grant does not provide him much for daily provisions, he routinely visits ten-year-old Lilia and her family for dinner, often bringing confectionery for the young girl. When Lilia mistakenly refers to Mr. Pirzada as \"Indian\" to her parents in private, her father tells her that he is Pakistani, which is puzzling to Lilia because he looks like her parents, eats the same things, and speaks Bengali like them. However, the constant television news of the East Pakistan-West Pakistan War informs her about Mr. Pirzada's differences as well as his current plight. Because of this, she decides one night to eat the candy he gives her, pray, and forgo brushing her teeth so that the magic of the candy through prayer will remain. She also tries her best to learn as much about Pakistan as possible from her school library. Her curiosity is stunted by her teacher telling her there is \"no reason to consult\" the book on Pakistan.\n\nDuring late October, her mother buys a large pumpkin, which Lilia insists she carves. Mr. Pirzada offers his help and ends up doing most of the cutting. When news of a potential war between India and West Pakistan over East Pakistan is reported, the knife slips from Mr. Pirzada's hand and forms an \"O\" as the jack-o-lantern's mouth. During Halloween, when Lilia and her friend Dora go trick-or-treating dressed as witches, Mr. Pirzada insists that he accompany them for safety purposes; Lilia responds, \"don't worry\" and soon realizes the irony of her statement. Mr. Pirzada responds, \"if the lady insists\" and stays with Lilia's parents for the night.\n\nDuring Lilia and Dora's stroll around the neighborhood, Dora asks why Mr. Pirzada wanted to accompany them so direly. Lilia remarks that \"his daughters are missing,\" which causes her great guilt upon saying it. Lilia then tries to justify to Dora that she misspoke a moment ago and that Mr. Pirzada's daughters are actually fine. That night, upon returning home, she learns of the imminent India-Pakistan War and when it occurs in December, their home is deprived of joy. After the new year, Mr. Pirzada returns home to a new nation, Bangladesh. Soon after when he sends pictures of him and all his daughters, Lilia and her family are relieved. Lilia reveals that she has been eating a piece of Halloween candy and praying for him everyday, but when she received the good news, stopped doing so and eventually decided to throw away the candy.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Das, Indian Americans visiting the country of their heritage, hire middle-aged tour guide Mr. Kapasi as their driver for the day as they tour. Mr. Kapasi notes the parents’ immaturity. Mr. and Mrs. Das look and act young to the point of childishness, go by their first names when talking to their children, Ronny, Bobby, and Tina, and seem selfishly indifferent to the kids. On their trip, when her husband and children get out of the car to sightsee, Mrs. Das sits in the car, eating snacks she offers to no one else, wearing her sunglasses as a barrier, and painting her nails. When Tina asks her to paint her nails as well, Mrs. Das just turns away and rebuffs her daughter.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Das ask the good-natured Mr. Kapasi about his job as a tour guide, and he tells them about his weekday job as an interpreter in a doctor's office. Mr. Kapasi's wife resents her husband's job because he works at the doctor's clinic that previously failed to cure their son of typhoid fever. She belittles his job, and he, too, discounts the importance of his occupation as a waste of his linguistic skills. However, Mrs. Das deems it “romantic” and a big responsibility, pointing out that the health of the patients depends upon Mr. Kapasi's correct interpretation of their maladies.\n\nMr. Kapasi begins to develop a romantic interest in Mrs. Das, and conducts a private conversation with her during the trip. Mr. Kapasi imagines a future correspondence with Mrs. Das, picturing them building a relationship to translate the transcontinental gap between them. However, Mrs. Das reveals a secret: she tells Mr. Kapasi the story of an affair she once had, and that her son Bobby had been born out of her adultery. She explains that she chose to tell Mr. Kapasi because of his profession; she hopes he can interpret her feelings and make her feel better as he does for his patients, translating without passing judgment. However, when Mr. Kapasi reveals his disappointment in her and points out her guilt, Mrs. Das storms off.\n\nAs Mrs. Das walks away towards her family, she leaves a trail of crumbs of puffed rice snacks, and monkeys begin to trail her. The neglectful Das parents don't notice as the monkeys, following Mrs. Das's food trail, surround their son, Bobby, isolating the son born of a different father. The monkeys begin to attack Bobby, and Mr. Kapasi rushes in to save him. Mr. Kapasi returns Bobby to his parents, and looks on as they clean up their son.\n\nBoori Ma is a feeble 64-year-old woman from Calcutta who is the stairsweeper, or durwan, of an old brick building. In exchange for her services, the residents allow Boori Ma to sleep in front of the collapsible gates leading into the tenement. While sweeping, she narrates stories of her past: her daughter's extravagant wedding, her servants, her estate and her riches. The residents of the brick building hear continuous contradictions in Boori's storytelling, but her stories are seductive and compelling, so they let her contradictions rest. One family in particular takes a liking to Boori Ma, the Dalals. Mrs. Dalal often gives Boori Ma food and takes care of her ailments. When Mr. Dalal gets promoted at work, he improves the brick building by installing a sink in the stairwell and a sink in his home. The Dalals continue to improve their home and even go away on a trip to Simla for ten days and promise to bring Boori Ma a sheep's hair blanket. While the Dalals are away, the other residents become obsessed with making their own improvement to the building. Boori Ma even spends her life savings on special treats while circling around the neighborhood. However, while Boori Ma is out one afternoon, the sink in the stairwell is stolen. The residents accuse Boori Ma of informing the robbers and in negligence for her job. When Boori Ma protests, the residents continue to accuse her because of all her previous inconsistent stories. The residents' obsession with materializing the building dimmed their focus on the remaining members of their community, like Boori Ma. The short story concludes as the residents throw out Boori Ma's belongings and begin a search for a 'real durwan'. Note that 'durwan' means housekeeper in both Bengali and Hindi.\n\n“Sexy” centers on Miranda, a young white woman who has an affair with a married Indian man named Dev. Although one of Miranda's work friends is an Indian woman named Laxmi, Miranda knows very little about India and its culture. The first time she meets Dev, she is not able to discern his ethnicity. However, she is instantly captivated by his charm and the thrill of being with an exotic, older man. Dev takes Miranda to the Mapparium, where he whispers \"You're sexy.\" Miranda buys \"sexy\" clothes that she thinks are suitable for a mistress, but feels pangs of guilt because Dev is married. Meanwhile, Laxmi's cousin has been abandoned by her husband, who left the cousin for a younger woman. One day, Laxmi's cousin comes to Boston and Miranda is asked to babysit the cousin's seven-year-old son, Rohin. Rohin asks Miranda to try on the sexy clothes that she bought, and gives Miranda insight into his mother's grief. Miranda decides that she and Dev's wife both \"deserve better,\" and stops seeing Dev.\n\nIn this story, 11-year-old Eliot begins staying with Mrs. Sen—a university professor's wife—after school. The caretaker, Mrs. Sen, chops and prepares food as she tells Eliot stories of her past life in Calcutta, helping to craft her identity. Like \"A Temporary Matter,\" this story is filled with lists of produce, catalogs of ingredients, and descriptions of recipes. Emphasis is placed on ingredients and the act of preparation. Other objects are emphasized as well, such as Mrs. Sen's colorful collection of saris from her native India. Much of the plot revolves around Mrs. Sen's tradition of purchasing fish from a local seafood market. This fish reminds Mrs. Sen of her home and holds great significance for her. However, reaching the seafood market requires driving, a skill that Mrs. Sen has not learned and resists learning. At the end of the story, Mrs. Sen attempts to drive to the market without her husband, and ends up in an automobile accident. Eliot soon stops staying with Mrs. Sen thereafter.\n\nSanjeev and Twinkle, a newly married couple, are exploring their new house in Hartford, Connecticut, which appears to have been owned by fervent Christians: they keep finding gaudy Biblical paraphernalia hidden throughout the house. While Twinkle is delighted by these objects and wants to display them everywhere, Sanjeev is uncomfortable with them and reminds her that they are Hindu, not Christian. This argument reveals other problems in their relationship; Sanjeev doesn't seem to understand Twinkle's spontaneity, whereas Twinkle has little regard for Sanjeev's discomfort. He is planning a party for his coworkers and is worried about the impression they might get from the interior decorating if their mantelpiece is full of Biblical figurines. After some arguing and a brief amount of tears, a compromise is reached. When the day of the party arrives, the guests are enamored with Twinkle. Sanjeev still has conflicting feelings about her; he is captivated by her beauty and energy, but irritated by her naivete and impractical tendencies. The story ends with her and the other party guests discovering a large bust of Jesus Christ in the attic. Although the object disgusts him, he obediently carries it downstairs. This action can be interpreted as Sanjeev giving into Twinkle and accepting her eccentricities.\n\n28-year-old Bibi Haldar is gripped by a mysterious ailment, and myriad tests and treatments have failed to cure her. She has been told to stand on her head, shun garlic, drink egg yolks in milk, to gain weight and to lose weight. The fits that could strike at any moment keep her confined to the home of her dismissive elder cousin and his wife, who provide her only meals, a room, and a length of cotton to replenish her wardrobe each year. Bibi keeps the inventory of her brother's cosmetics stall and is watched over by the women of their community. She sweeps the store, wondering loudly why she was cursed to this fate, to be alone and jealous of the wives and mothers around her. The women come to the conclusion that she wants a man. When they show her artifacts from their weddings, Bibi proclaims what her own wedding will look like. Bibi is inconsolable at the prospect of never getting married. The women try to calm her by wrapping her in shawls, washing her face or buying her new blouses. After a particularly violent fit, her cousin Haldar emerges to take her to the polyclinic. A remedy is prescribed—marriage: “Relations will calm her blood.” Bibi is delighted by this news and begins to plan and plot the wedding and to prepare herself physically and mentally. But Haldar and his wife dismiss this possibility. She is nearly 30, the wife says, and unskilled in the ways of being a woman: her studies ceased prematurely, she is not allowed to watch TV, she has not been told how to pin a sari or how to prepare meals. The women don't understand why, then, this reluctance to marry her off if she such a burden to Haldar and his wife. The wife asks who will pay for the wedding?\n\nOne morning, wearing a donated sari, Bibi demands that Haldar take her to be photographed so her image can be circulated among the bachelors, like other brides-in-waiting. Haldar refuses. He says she is a bane for business, a liability and a loss. In retaliation, Bibi stops calculating the inventory for the shop and circulates gossip about Haldar's wife. To quiet her down, Haldar places an ad in the paper proclaiming the availability of an “unstable” bride. No family would take the risk. Still, the women try to prepare her for her wifely duties. After two months of no suitors, Haldar and his wife feel vindicated. Things were not so bad when Bibi's father was alive. He created charts of her fits and wrote to doctors abroad to try to cure her. He also distributed information to the members of the village so they were aware of her condition. But now only the women can look after her while being thankful, in private, that she is not their responsibility.\n\nWhen Haldar's wife gets pregnant, Bibi is kept away from her for fear of infecting the child. Her plates are not washed with the others, and she is given separate towels and soap. Bibi suffers another attack on the banks of the fish pond, convulsing for nearly two minutes. The husbands of the village escort her home in order to find her rest, a compress, and a sedative tablet. But Haldar and his wife do not let her in. That night, Bibi sleeps in the storage room. After a difficult birth, Haldar's wife delivers a girl. Bibi sleeps in the basement and is not allowed direct contact with the girl. She suffers more unchecked fits. The women voice their concern but it goes unheeded. They take their business elsewhere and the cosmetics in the stall soon expire on their shelves. In autumn, Haldar's daughter becomes ill. Bibi is blamed. Bibi moves back into the storeroom and stops socializing—and stops searching for a husband. By the end of the year, Haldar is driven out of business, and he packs his family up and moves away. He leaves Bibi behind with only a thin envelope of cash.\n\nThere is no more news of them and a letter written to Bibi's only other known relative is returned by the postal service. The women spruce up the storeroom and send their children to play on their roof in order to alert others in the event of an attack. At night, however, Bibi is left alone. Haggard, she circles the parapet but never leaves the roof. In spring, vomit is discovered by the cistern and the women find Bibi, pregnant. The women search for traces of assault, but Bibi's storeroom is tidy. She refuses to tell the women who the father is, only saying that she can't remember what happened. A ledger with men's names lay open near her cot. The women help her carry her son to term and teach her how to care for the baby. She takes Haldar's old creams and wares out of the basement and reopens his shop. The women spread the word and soon the stall is providing enough money for Bibi to raise her boy. For years, the women try to sniff out who had disgraced Bibi but to no avail. The one fact they could agree upon is that Bibi seemed to be cured.\n\nIn \"The Third and Final Continent\", the narrator lives in India, then moves to London, then finally to America. The title of this story tells us that the narrator has been to three different continents and chooses to stay in the third, North America. As soon as the narrator arrives he decides to stay at the YMCA. After saving some money he decides to move somewhere a little more like home. He responds to an advertisement in the paper and ends up living with an elderly woman. At first he is very respectful and courteous to the elderly woman. The narrator does not feel that he owes the old woman anything and does not really go out of his way for her.\n\nBut after he discovers that the elderly woman is one hundred and three years old he then changes. He becomes more caring and even amazed that this old woman has lived for one hundred and three years. Because of this woman's age she is not accustomed to the modern times in which this story takes place. The narrator just like the elderly woman is not accustomed to the times in America but also America in general. So this may help the narrator to feel more comfortable in his new setting. After living with the elderly woman for about six weeks, the narrator grows somewhat attached to this woman.\n\nOnce his wife, who he was set up beforehand to marry, arrives in America he then decides to move to a bigger home. Upon this decision, he also realizes that he is going to have to look out for and nurture his new wife. After living with his wife for some time, who he at first had barely known, he soon finds out that the elderly woman he had once lived with is now dead. This hurts him because this is the first person in America for whom he had felt any feelings. After the woman's death, he then becomes more comfortable with his wife, not because the woman died but because of the time he is spending with his wife. Just like his relationship with elderly woman, the more time he spends with a person the closer he becomes with them. After sometime the narrator falls in love with his wife and is constantly remembering the elderly woman with whom he had once lived.\n\n\"Interpreter of Maladies\" garnered universal acclaim from myriad publications. Michiko Kakutani of the \"New York Times\" praises Lahiri for her writing style, citing her \"uncommon elegance and poise.\" \"Time\" applauded the collection for \"illuminating the full meaning of brief relationships—with lovers, family friends, those met in travel\". Ronny Noor asserts, \"The value of these stories—although some of them are loosely constructed—lies into fact that they transcend confined borders of immigrant experience to embrace larger age-old issues that are, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 'cast into the mould of these new times' redefining America.\"\n\nNoelle Brada-Williams notes that Indian-American literature is under-represented and that Lahiri deliberately tries to give a diverse view of Indian Americans so as not to brand the group as a whole. She also argues that \"Interpreter of Maladies\" is not just a collection of random short stories that have common components, but a \"short story cycle\" in which the themes and motifs are intentionally connected to produce a cumulative effect on the reader: \"...a deeper look reveals the intricate use of pattern and motif to bind the stories together, including recurring themes of the barriers to and opportunities for human communication; community, including marital, extra-marital, and parent-child relationships; and the dichotomy of care and neglect.\"\n\nKetu H. Katrak reads \"Interpreter of Maladies\" as reflecting the trauma of self-transformation through immigration, which can result in a series of broken identities that form \"multiple anchorages.\" Lahiri's stories show the diasporic struggle to keep hold of culture as characters create new lives in foreign cultures. Relationships, language, rituals, and religion all help these characters maintain their culture in new surroundings even as they build a \"hybrid realization\" as Asian Americans.\n\nLaura Anh Williams observes the stories as highlighting the frequently omitted female diasporic subject. Through the foods they eat, and the ways they prepare and eat them, the women in these stories utilize foodways to construct their own unique racialized subjectivity and to engender agency. Williams notes the ability of food in literature to function autobiographically, and in fact, \"Interpreter of Maladies\" indeed reflects Lahiri's own family experiences. Lahiri recalls that for her mother, cooking \"was her jurisdiction. It was also her secret.\" For individuals such as Lahiri's' mother, cooking constructs a sense of identity, interrelationship, and home that is simultaneously communal and yet also highly personal.\n\n\"Interpreter of Maladies\" has been translated into many languages:\n\n"}

In the past, it housed one of the most famous symbols of the city, “The Rhea Neck”, a palm tree whose trunk resembled a rhea’s neck. It was located near the present Yacht Club Alagoas (Clube Alagoinha). The reefs form natural pools and it is very common, during low tides, to see tourists bathing in these pools, especially near the lighthouse. There are some stands with live music, bars, restaurants, snack bars, and hotels.\n\nPonta Verde is localised in the South Zone.\n\nPonta Verde has a typical tropical climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and pleasant trade winds blowing from the ocean. January is the warmest month, with mean maximum of 31 °C and minimum of 22 °C; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with means of 26 °C and 15 °C.

The team was created by Fred Stovall, a Texan oil drilling millionaire, who later financed the Negro Southern League. In the 1930s, a time of acute segregation in most of the U.S., the team's games were watched by crowds of black and white people alike. Hall of Famer Hilton Smith previously played for the team.\n\nWhen the team first formed it played in the semi-pro Dixie League until Stovall formed the Negro Southern League, with four other teams in 1932. The NSL is considered a \"de facto\" major league that year, since it was the only organized league to complete the 1932 season. The Monarchs finished with a 26-22 record in their only season they were considered a major league team, and did not qualify for any post-season play-off.\n\nThe team played in Casino Park in Monroe, at what became 29th and Hope. It was 360 feet (110 metres) in left, 450 feet (138 metres) in center and 330 feet (102 metres) in right. Built on Stovall's plantation, the park and its associated recreational facilities (including a swimming pool and a dance pavilion) were considered some of the finest in the league.\n\nStovall accommodated the players in houses on his plantation, provided a cook to prepare their meals, and bought three brand-new Ford cars in 1932 for the team's travel.\n\nThe team disbanded soon after 1935 and in 1937 Casino Park was leased to a local white team—the Monroe Twins who became the Monroe White Sox in 1938—who played in the Cotton States League.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the Monroe Monarchs Field was opened to the public in Monroe, Louisiana. At the opening, the Monroe Monarchs Historical Foundation, founded in 2006 by native Monroyans Scott Greer and Jeffrey Newman, unveiled a historical marker dedicated to the former Negro league team.\n\n\n\n"}

It is not known who wrote it but it is known that it was prepared by Sioeli Fusikata. When it was written, it had become a popular song on Niue but the opportunity rarely arose for people to perform it publicly. In the 1963 South Pacific Games, Niue used the Flag of New Zealand as the flag to represent them in keeping with the rest of the colonies of the British Empire not using the Union Jack at the games. Niue also used \"Ko e Iki he Lagi\" as their anthem instead of \"God Defend New Zealand\" because the organisers had requested that \"identifying tunes\" be used to represent nations at the games instead of recognized national anthems.

{"id": "2299192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299192", "title": "Rajneeshpuram", "text": "Rajneeshpuram\n\nRajneeshpuram was a religious intentional community in Wasco County, Oregon, briefly incorporated as a city between 1981 and 1988.  Its population consisted entirely of Rajneeshees, followers of the spiritual teacher Rajneesh, later known as Osho. Its citizens and leaders were responsible for launching the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attacks, the single largest bioterrorist attack in the United States, as well as the planned 1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot, in which they conspired to assassinate Charles Turner, the then-United States Attorney for the District of Oregon.\n\nTensions with the public and threatened punitive action by Indian authorities originally motivated the founders and leaders of the Rajneeshee movement, Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh and Ma Anand Sheela, to leave India and begin a new religious settlement in the United States. Discussions of this new settlement began as early as 1980, but Rajneesh did not agree to relocate until May 1981, when he travelled to the United States on a tourist visa, ostensibly for medical purposes. Rajneeshpuram was planned from the beginning as a home for Rajneesh's followers in the United States, most of whom were told to sell all of their belongings before moving there. The decision to register as a town was made primarily so that Rajneesh could govern over his followers without attracting attention from authorities.\n\nRajneeshpuram was on the site of a Central Oregon property known as the Big Muddy Ranch, near Antelope, Oregon, which was purchased by Sheela's husband, John Shelfer, in 1981 for $5.75 million, ($ in today's dollars). Within a year of arriving, the commune's leaders had become embroiled in a series of legal battles with their neighbors, primarily over land use. They had initially stated that they were planning to create a small agricultural community, their land being zoned for agricultural use, but it soon became apparent that they wanted to establish the kind of infrastructure and services normally associated with a town.\n\nWithin three years, the neo-sannyasins (Rajneesh's followers, also termed Rajneeshees in contemporaneous press reports) developed a community, turning the ranch from an empty rural property into a city of up to 7,000 people, complete with typical urban infrastructure such as a fire department, police, restaurants, malls, townhouses, a airstrip, a public transport system using buses, a sewage reclamation plant, a reservoir, and a post office with the ZIP code 97741. It is thought that the actual population during this time is potentially much higher than they claimed, and the neo-sannyasins may have gone as far as to hide beds and citizens during investigations. Various legal conflicts, primarily over land use, escalated to bitter hostility between the commune and local residents, and the commune was subject to sustained and coordinated pressures from various coalitions of Oregon residents over the length of its existence.\n\nThe city of Antelope, Oregon, became a focal point of the conflict. It was the nearest town to the ranch, and had a population of under 60. Initially, Rajneesh's followers had purchased only a small number of lots in Antelope. After the activist group 1000 Friends of Oregon became involved, Antelope denied the sannyasins a business permit for their mail-order operation, and more sannyasins moved into the town. In April 1982, Antelope held a vote to disincorporate itself, to prevent itself being taken over. By this time, there were enough Rajneeshee residents to defeat the measure. In May 1982, the residents of the Rancho Rajneesh commune voted to incorporate the separate city of Rajneeshpuram on the ranch. Apart from the control of Antelope and the land-use question, there were other disputes. The commune leadership took an aggressive stance on many issues and initiated litigation against various groups and individuals.\nThe June 1983 bombing of Hotel Rajneesh, a Rajneeshee-owned hotel in Portland, by the Islamist militant group Jamaat ul-Fuqra further heightened tensions. The display of semi-automatic weapons acquired by the Rajneeshpuram Peace Force created an image of imminent violence. Rumors arose of the National Guard being called in to arrest Rajneesh. At the same time, the commune was embroiled in a range of legal disputes. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer maintained that the city was essentially an arm of a religious organization, and that its incorporation thus violated the principle of separation of church and state. 1000 Friends of Oregon claimed that the city violated state land-use laws. In 1983, a lawsuit was filed by the State of Oregon to invalidate the city's incorporation, and many attempts to expand the city further were legally blocked, prompting followers to attempt to build in nearby Antelope, which was briefly named Rajneesh, when sufficient numbers of Rajneeshees registered to vote there and won a referendum on the subject.\n\nThe Rajneeshpuram residents believed that the wider Oregonian community was both bigoted and suffered from religious intolerance. According to Latkin (1992) Rajneesh's followers had made peaceful overtures to the local community when they first arrived in Oregon. As Rajneeshpuram grew in size heightened tension led certain fundamentalist Christian church leaders to denounce Rajneesh, the commune, and his followers. Petitions were circulated aimed at ridding the state of the perceived menace. Letters to state newspapers reviled the Rajneeshees, one of them likening Rajneeshpuram to another Sodom and Gomorrah, another referring to them as a \"cancer in our midst.\" In time, circulars mixing \"hunting humor\" with dehumanizing characterizations of Rajneeshees began to appear at gun clubs, turkey shoots and other gatherings; one of these, circulated widely over the Northwest, declared \"an open season on the central eastern Rajneesh, known locally as the Red Rats or Red Vermin.\"\n\nAs Rajneesh himself did not speak in public during this period, and until October 1984 gave few interviews, his secretary and chief spokesperson Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) became, for practical purposes, the leader of the commune. She did little to defuse the conflict, employing a crude, caustic and defensive speaking style that exacerbated hostilities and attracted media attention. On September 14, 1985, Sheela and 15 to 20 other top officials abruptly left Rajneeshpuram. The following week, Rajneesh convened press conferences and publicly accused Sheela and her team of having committed crimes within and outside the commune. The subsequent criminal investigation, the largest in Oregon history, confirmed that a secretive group had, unbeknownst to both government officials and nearly all Rajneeshpuram residents, engaged in a variety of criminal activities, including the attempted murder of Rajneesh's physician, wiretapping and bugging within the commune and within Rajneesh's home, poisonings of two public officials, and arson.\n\nIn 1984, Sheela Silverman coordinated an attack alongside Rajneeshpuram citizens to infect the salad bars of at least ten restaurants in the county seat of Wasco County with salmonella, in an attempt to incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 Wasco County elections. While 751 people, including several Wasco County public officials, were infected, and 45 people were hospitalized, there were no fatalities. This incident is still regarded as the single largest biological warfare attack in United States history.\n\nLocal residents, suspecting Rajneeshpuram to be involved in the poisonings, turned out in droves on election day to prevent them from winning any county positions. The Rajneeshees eventually withdrew their candidate from the November 1984 ballot, rendering their plot unsuccessful.\n\nSheela was extradited from West Germany and imprisoned for attempted murder, assault, wiretapping, arson, immigration fraud, and her role in the bioterror attack. During the next few years the movement also came under investigation for multiple other felonies:\n\n- Arson: On January 14, 1985 the Wasco County Planning Department office, which held the files on long-running disputes involving the Rajneeshees, was set on fire. The fire extensively damaged the office and destroyed one-third to one-half of the county's files.\n\n- Attempted Murder (\"Main article: 1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot\"): Several commune members plotted to kill Charles H. Turner, the U.S. state attorney in Portland, and several other persons considered to be Rajneeshee enemies. Others were on the “hit list” including Dave Frohnmayer, the Oregon Attorney General who first started to publicly dispute the Rajneesh activities.\n\n- Immigration Fraud: Despite originally travelling to the United States claiming medical reasons, Rajneesh never sought medical treatment during his residence, and later admitted to counts of immigration fraud.\n\n- Voting Fraud: The Rajneeshpuram community attempted to sway local elections in their favor in a variety of methods, including the \"Share-a-Home\" program, in which they transported thousands of homeless people to Rajneeshpuram and attempted to register them to vote to inflate the constituency of voters for the group's candidates. The Wasco county clerk countered this attempt by enforcing a regulation that required all new voters to submit their qualifications when registering to vote.\n\n- Drug Smuggling\n\nThese criminal activities had, according to the Office of the Attorney General, begun in the spring of 1984, three years after the establishment of the commune. Rajneesh himself was accused of immigration violations, to which he entered an Alford plea. As part of his plea bargain, he agreed to leave the United States and eventually returned to Poona, India. His followers left Oregon shortly afterwards.\n\nThe increasing ability and capacity of local and state regulators to actively limit the development of Rajneeshpuram this way was one major factor that lead to the sudden collapse of the commune in September and October 1985.\n\nThe legal standing of Rajneeshpuram remained ambiguous. In the church/state suit, Federal Judge Helen J. Frye ruled against Rajneeshpuram in late 1985, a decision that was not contested, since it came too late to be of practical significance. The Oregon courts, however, eventually found in favor of the city, with the Court of Appeals determining in 1986 that incorporation had not violated the state planning system's agricultural land goals. The Oregon Supreme Court ended litigation in 1987, leaving Rajneeshpuram empty and bankrupt, but legal within Oregon law.\n\nOriginally listed for over $28 million in 1985, the ranch was sold at a sheriff's auction for $4.5 million in late 1988 to Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, the sole bidder.\n\nDennis R. Washington's firm Washington Construction purchased The Big Muddy Ranch for $3.6 million in 1991. Washington attempted to run the ranch for profit, and also unsuccessfully negotiated with the state to turn it into a state park.\n\nIn 1996, Washington donated the ranch to Young Life, a Christian youth organization. Since 1999, Young Life has operated a summer camp there, first as the WildHorse Canyon Camp, later as the Washington Family Ranch.\n\nThere are two camps on the property today. The primary camp, Washington Family Ranch: Canyon serves high school students, while the smaller camp, Washington Family Ranch: Creekside, primarily serves middle school students.\n\nThe Big Muddy Ranch Airport is also located there.\n\n\n|image2= Building Oregon: Images of Rajneeshpuram\n"}

It was released in November 1980 on Atlantic Records as the final album before the group disbanded in early 1981. Their first live album in seven years, it is compiled of recordings from their 1976, 1977, and 1978 tours from dates in North America and Europe with its mixing supervised by bassist Chris Squire.\n\n\"Yesshows\" was remastered and expanded in 2009 by Isao Kikuchi, and published by Warner Music Japan as part of their \"Yes SHM-CD Papersleeve\" series.\n\nIn June 1979, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White, finished their 1978–1979 tour in support of the band's eighth studio album, \"Tormato\" (1978). Their label Atlantic Records had approached the group about the possibility of putting out a live album as a follow-up to their first, \"Yessongs\" (1973), and Squire had the task of sifting through hours of tapes of concerts recorded since then and select the best cuts. He also undertook mixing duties, and prepared a selection of tracks from the 1976, 1977, and 1978 tours across five dates from his studio, Sun Park Studios.\n\nThe band commissioned longtime cover artist Roger Dean to produce artwork for the album, which was completed using acrylic paints and collage. A release date of Christmas 1979 was set, but it was shelved following disagreements from other band members regarding Squire's choice of performances and the quality of his mixes. Howe was glad that production had halted and \"strongly objected\" to some of the production edits that Squire had done. He expressed the rest of the band's wish to refine the recordings further and to add more tracks to expand the set from a double to a triple album.\n\nBy mid-1980, Yes had a change in personnel following the departures of Anderson and Wakeman, and the remaining members recruited Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes of The Buggles as replacements on vocals and keyboards, respectively. The five recorded \"Drama\" (1980), and toured the album from August to December 1980. Towards the end of that year, Atlantic Records wished to release a live album and used the cuts and mixes that Squire had prepared as the final release. Mastering was completed at Strawberry Mastering.\n\n\"Yesshows\" comprises seven songs taken from five concerts. \"The Gates of Delirium\" and \"Ritual\" are from 17 August 1976 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, during the band's 1976 North American tour. \"Parallels\", \"Going for the One\", and \"Wonderous Stories\" were recorded on 24 November 1977 at Ahoy-Hal in Rotterdam during the 1977 tour in support of \"Going for the One\" (1977). \"Time and a Word\" and \"Don't Kill the Whale\" are from the Wembley Arena in Wembley, London from the \"Tormato\" tour. The latter was recorded by the BBC using the Manor Mobile studio for a live radio broadcast of the 28 October 1978 concert.\n\n\"Yesshows\" was released in November 1980; it was released in the US on 24 November 1980. It did not enter the UK Albums Chart until the 10 January 1981 when it reached No. 29. In its third week, it reached its peak at No. 22, and remained on the chart for five more weeks. In the US, the album peaked at No. 43 on the \"Billboard\" 200 on 31 January 1981, during a 12-week stay on the chart.\n\nBand opinion of this second live album by Yes was divided, at least up to the 1990s. As reported by author David Watkinson, the label did not inform everyone of events. Wakeman, who was not in the group at the time of release, said that Squire's mixes were \"good but nothing exciting. The next thing I know was that somebody gave me a copy\". While he, Anderson, and Howe did not care for the final release, Moraz, White, and Squire gave it more approval.\n\nWriting for Sounds magazine in late 1980, John Gill recommended, “For Delirium and Ritual alone, I'd buy it.” The UCLA Daily Bruin perhaps spoke for many fans of the time when it stated, “The inclusion of 'Gates of Delirium' and 'Ritual' are enough to justify the existence of Yesshows” but the review also noted that with Anderson and Wakeman recently exiting the group (and the Buggles merging in), an opportunity was missed to include old high-rated classics. It called the inclusion of “Don't Kill The Whale” a “worthy message, but not a particularly good Yes song.”\n\nCredits are taken from the 1980 and 1994 liner notes.\n\nYes\n\nProduction\n\nSources\n"}

This constitution was far less liberal than the federal constitution of the German Empire.\n\nThe government was not responsible to the \"Abgeordnetenhaus\" (lower chamber), whose powers were small and whose members were elected by a Prussian three-class francsuffrage system based on tax-paying ab\"Herrenhaus\" (upper chamber) was largely controlled by the conservative Junkers, who held immense tracts of generally poor land east of the Elbe (particularly in East Prussia). Endowed with little money and much pride, they had continued to form the officer corps of the Prussian Army. The rising industrialists, notably the great Rhenish and Westphalian mine owners and steel magnates, although their interests were often opposed to those of the Junkers, exerted an equally reactionary influence on politics. The \"potential power of the Prusso-German crown was vast\" (Christopher Clarke, \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\"); for example, the monarch held the power to nominate and dismiss Prussian officials (as well as federal ones). His assent was also necessary for legislation to pass into law, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and coming with this, the power to appoint or dismiss officials during peacetime. In a decree William I of Prussia, stated that acts of the Prussian government were those of the King of Prussia, \"from whose decision they originate, and who expresses his opinion and will constitutionally through them\".\n\nPrussia was transformed from a duchy to a kingdom on 18 January 1701 by Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg who declared himself King in Prussia. He was allowed to be king only in the Prussian kingdom to avoid offending the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, who had power over most of his lands. Brandenburg was treated as a separate state from the Prussian Kingdom. The state of Brandenburg was later considered as part of Prussia although most of its territories lay outside Prussia proper. The kingdom grew magnificently during King Frederick I reign.\n\nKing Frederick II of Prussia succeeded Frederick I's son Frederick William. He considered himself as the first true servant of Prussia. He promoted the development of Prussia such as the Oderbruch. He also developed the military structure of the state and got involved in the First Partition of Poland with Austria and Russia. Frederick the Great became known as the first “\"King of Prussia\".” During his reign, he practiced enlightened absolutism. He was a fair king who introduced the civil code and abolished torture. He applied the principle that the monarchy should not go interfere with the justice system.\n\nIn 1847, Prussia experienced crisis common to all German states. There were catastrophic crop failures, bread riots, serious business recession and government incapability. In 1848, drastic changes in the Prussian kingdom began. Many bloody revolutions forced Frederick William IV to make transformations in the government. New ministers occupied a middle position in an unstable government structure. The King was gradually recovering power over his states with the aid of a set of advisers called the \"Kamarilla\". An elected national assembly was challenging the reemergence of the King's power. There began a tug-of-war in the power over the governance of the Kingdom between the king and the national assembly. After a series of cabinet reshuffles and government transformations, a new constitution was approved. It excluded a systematic democratic influence which shows that revolutionary movements had not much power. However, the king had lost his absolute powers. A new constitution was adopted which made the kingdom of Prussia a constitutional state. It was one of the most significant achievements of the revolutions.\n\n\nThe Prussian constitution was liberalized after Prussia became a republic in 1918, and the Junkers lost many of their estates through the cession of Prussian territory to Poland. However, both the Junkers and the Rhenish industrialists continued to exert much power behind the scenes, and when Franz von Papen became German chancellor in 1932 and commissioner for Prussia, they came into their own. In July, 1932, Papen suspended the Prussian parliament and ousted the Social Democrat Otto Braun, who had been premier of Prussia (with brief interruptions) from 1920.\n\n\n\n"}

Their albums have never been out of print and they continue to be made available on new audiophile formats such as SHM-CDs. Former members of the Flower Travellin' Band continue to perform FTB songs live together under the name Flower Power with other musicians.\n\nThe band was initially started as a side-project by Yuya Uchida when he returned to Japan after visiting his friend John Lennon in England in the mid 1960s, where he was introduced to various upcoming artists such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix. Yuya wanted to introduce a similar sound to the Japanese, and formed the \"Flowers\" as a cover band with various group sounds musicians, and two vocalists; male singer Hiroshi Chiba and female singer Remi Aso. They released the album \"Challenge!\" in 1968, featuring covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company, in addition to an original song. The cover caused a stir in the Japanese media as it depicted each member posing naked.\n\nIn 1969, after the release of the album; Remi Aso and guitarist Katsuhiko Kobayashi relocated to the United States. Yuya dropped all the remaining members, except drummer George Wada, recruited guitarist Hideki Ishima and vocalist Joe Yamanaka from the blues group Mystic Morning and bassist Jun Kobayashi, and formed the Flower Travellin' Band as a band that would appeal to international audiences. Their first releases were backing jazz trumpeter Terumasa Hino on the single \"Crash\" followed by the mini-album \"Anywhere\" in 1970, made to emulate the Flowers' release by means of cover songs and a nude photo on the album's front.\n\nAt Expo '70, members of Canadian rock band Lighthouse saw Flower Travellin' Band perform, liked what they saw and suggested they go to Canada. The group quickly recorded their first album of original material, \"Satori\" released in 1971, to have something to bring with them. In December 1970, they relocated to Toronto where they performed with Dr. John and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In 1971 they performed four large concerts with Lighthouse at Ontario Place. While in Toronto they recorded their second original album \"Made in Japan\" and were approached by GRT Records.\n\nThey returned to Japan in March 1972 for a show at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, and in 1973 were billed to perform with the Rolling Stones throughout their Japanese tour; however, all concerts were canceled when Mick Jagger's visa was rejected due to a drug conviction. They released a half-studio, half-live album titled \"Make Up\" and in April performed at Maruyama Park in Kyoto.\nIt was their last concert before a long hiatus, as at this time Yuya became involved in numerous projects and each member went on to an individual career. Joe Yamanaka recorded numerous solo albums, and collaborated with the iconic reggae band The Wailers in the 1980s. Having quit the guitar in 1990, Hideki Ishima continued his studies of the sitar, which he began around 1968, under Indian classical musician Manilal Nag and his Japanese apprentice in 1998. In 2000, he invented the sitarla, which combines the qualities of a solid-body electric guitar and the sitar.\n\nOn November 25, 2007, Flower Travellin' Band officially reunited and formally recruited keyboardist Nobuhiko Shinohara, with whom they had previously worked. Ishima revealed that there were several talks about getting back together prior, but they were all centered around nostalgia, something he has no interest in. It was only when their producer suggested they write new material and play it together with the old songs for a three-year period that a reunion came to fruition. Ishima also said that even though Kobayashi and Kozuki had not played in years, they were eager and pushed him into doing it, helped by the fact that his new instrument made the old material interesting. In 2008, 35 years after their last, they released the album \"We Are Here\". They performed in New York City in November and in Canada the following month. In March 2010, future tours and productions were halted when it was announced that Yamanaka was diagnosed with lung cancer.

{"id": "2299256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299256", "title": "The Persian Boy", "text": "The Persian Boy\n\nThe Persian Boy is a 1972 historical novel written by Mary Renault and narrated by Bagoas, a young Persian from an aristocratic family who is captured by his father's enemies, castrated, and sold as a slave to king Darius III, who makes him his favorite. Eventually he becomes the lover and most faithful servant of Alexander the Great, who overthrew Darius and captured the Persian Empire. Bagoas' narration provides both a Persian view of the conquest and an intimate look at the personality of the conqueror. In Renault's view, Alexander's love for Bagoas influenced his desire to unite the Greek and Persian peoples. Renault also posits the notion that Alexander's relentless drive to conquer the world stemmed in part from his troubled relationship with his domineering mother, and his desire to \"escape\" from her influence by leading his army ever eastward.\n\nThe novel is a sequel to Renault's \"Fire from Heaven\" (1969). \"The Persian Boy\" was a bestseller within the gay community.\n\nLike much of Renault's fiction, the book, published in 1972, provides a sympathetic portrait of homosexual love. \"The Persian Boy\" is notable for its depiction of the tradition of pederasty in ancient Greece, where relationships between adult men and adolescent boys were celebrated. In the novel, Bagoas is 15 years old when he begins his relationship with Alexander (then about 26). Renault depicts the attachment as lasting until Alexander's death, when Bagoas would have been about 22. She explores the tensions in the triangular relationship between Alexander and his two lovers, Hephaistion and Bagoas, and suggests that Alexander went mad with grief over Hephaistion's untimely death.\n\nThe book describes the major incidents of Alexander's later career, such as his conquest of Bactria, the controversy over Alexander's adoption of Persian customs like proskynesis, his abortive invasion of India, his marriage to Roxana, his crossing of the Gedrosian Desert, the death of Hephaistion and his own final illness and death.\n\nBagoas was a historical figure, identified by the Roman historian Curtius as \"a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was intimate and with whom Alexander would later be intimate.\" Plutarch described Alexander's troops, seeing their leader sitting with the boy, as \"clapping their hands and shouting till Alexander put his arms round him and kissed him.\" From these and a few other fragments, Renault creates an imaginative portrait of a lover and confidant to Alexander. In a review of \"The Persian Boy\", historian Jeanne Reames wrote:\nCurtius' history of Alexander presents Bagoas as a vindictive schemer who revenges himself on a Persian noble named Orsines who failed to give him gifts by lying to Alexander about him, eventually succeeding in having him tried and executed. Renault, who accuses Curtius of \"muddled sensationalism\" in an author's note, points to other sources who suggest that Orxines (as she calls him) was in fact a \"murderous\" character, and portrays him in the novel as fully deserving his fate. The claim by Curtius that Orsines did not plunder the royal tombs but that these sepulchres were devoid in the first place of rich offerings is an absurd one, as Renault points out, and totally unacceptable in the light of our knowledge of Persian culture.\n\nRenault also points out that the incident in which the army clamored for Alexander to kiss Bagoas took place very soon after the crossing of the Gedrosian desert, when all those present were survivors of that harrowing incident. Renault argues that Bagoas must have earned the admiration and affection of the army by his courage and fortitude, and his help to others, during the desert crossing.\n"}

He began his career playing keyboard for Imogen Heap, and has produced or contributed to albums by Brian Eno, Coldplay, David Holmes and others.\n\nHopkins composed the soundtrack for the 2010 film \"Monsters\", which was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Score. His third studio album, \"Insides\", reached no. 15 on the US Dance/Electronic Albums chart in 2009. His collaborations on \"Small Craft on a Milk Sea\" with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams and \"Diamond Mine\" with King Creosote both reached no. 82 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2011 \"Diamond Mine\" was nominated for a Mercury Prize. \"Immunity\" was also nominated for the 2013 Mercury Prize. His fifth studio album \"Singularity\" received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album in December 2018.\n\nJon Hopkins was born in 1979 in Kingston upon Thames and grew up in nearby Wimbledon. He first became aware of electronic music after hearing early house music on the radio at the age of seven or eight, and also became a fan of Depeche Mode and the Pet Shop Boys. These records inspired an early fascination with synths.\n\nAt the age of 12 Hopkins began studying piano at the Junior Department of the Royal College of Music in London, where he continued until age 17. The composers that were greatly influential to him whilst studying were Ravel and Stravinsky, and he eventually won a competition to perform a concert of Ravel's Piano Concerto in G with an orchestra. For a time Hopkins considered becoming a professional pianist, only to decide classical performance was too formal and unnerving to pursue full-time.\n\nAs a teenager he also listened to acid house, early hardcore, grunge, as well as electronica artists such as Acen, Seefeel, and Plaid. When Hopkins was 14 he got his first computer, an Amiga 500, and started programming MIDI material. By the age of 15 he had saved up enough money from winning piano competitions to buy a low-level professional Roland synth, and on this he began creating his first full-length electronic compositions.\n\nAfter finishing his final exams at age 17, Hopkins accompanied his friend Leo Abrahams to an audition for Imogen Heap's backing band. Hopkins decided to audition as well, and was hired to handle both keyboard and samples, while Abrahams was hired as guitarist. He toured with the new band for the entirety of 1998.\n\nIn 1999 Hopkins signed with boutique London label Just Music as a solo artist, and began recording his debut album \"Opalescent\". At the time he was also working part-time as a studio session musician. \"Opalescent\" attracted positive press attention upon its release, and several tracks were licensed to \"Sex and the City\". \"The Guardian\" reviewed it as \"a beautifully realized debut. Using synth oozes, phased and echoed guitars and pianos and chilled beats, his wonderful tunes drift from calm to eerie power like a restless sea. It will delight any lovers of beautiful music.\" \"DJ Magazine\" gave it 4/5 stars, and stated \"Piano, guitar strings and slow beats blend like the clouds at sunset (or an opiate smoothy) filtering in and out like elegantly wasted beauty. Darker drums add a further depth.\"\n\nHopkins released his second album, \"Contact Note\", on Just Music in 2004 while still working as a studio musician. The album slowly gained an underground following but failed to take off, and led Hopkins to become disillusioned with his solo career, and take a break from writing to learn how to become a producer.\n\nBy 2004, Abrahams had been collaborating for some time with ambient musician and producer Brian Eno. Abrahams played some of Hopkins' second record for Eno, and Eno invited him to join them for a jam session. On the first day of their collaboration they came up with some of the music for Eno's upcoming album \"Another Day on Earth\", and Hopkins became a long-term collaborator. Shortly afterwards Hopkins produced King Creosote's album \"Bombshell\", which initiated his relationship with the Fence Collective. He also co-wrote tracks with DJ and composer David Holmes for Holmes' \"Holy Pictures\" album, and remixed for James Yorkston.\n\nIn 2007, Hopkins was invited by Eno, who was producing Coldplay's upcoming album \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", to join the band in the studio for a day. Hopkins ended up staying and contributing to the album for the next year, co-producing several tracks and playing organs, harmoniums, and other keyboard instruments on others. The intro to the track \"Violet Hill\" came from an improvisation with Hopkins and Davide Rossi, the album's string arranger. Throughout this period Hopkins was periodically creating his own solo tracks, and his song \"Light Through the Veins\" was adapted to serve as the introduction to the album's first track \"Life in Technicolor\". \"Light Through the Veins\" was also picked by the band to serve as the backing for the track \"The Escapist\", which is hidden at the end of the album. \"Viva la Vida\" was released in 2008, and won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and became the best-selling album of 2008. Coldplay asked Hopkins to serve as the pre-show DJ and opening act for their 2008 world tour. Hopkins toured with the band for six months through England, the United States, and Japan. He performed at venues including Madison Square Garden and the London O2 Arena, with crowds as large as 20,000 people.\n\nIn 2008 Hopkins was commissioned by choreographer Wayne McGregor to compose music for \"Entity\", a production of McGregor's \"Random Dance\" group. \"Entity\" was performed live at Sadler's Wells in April 2008 to critical acclaim. A world tour followed throughout 2008 and 2009.\n\nHopkins also has co-writing or producing credits on albums by artists such as David Holmes and Dan Arborise. He is also known for remixing a variety of artists, including Wild Beasts, Nosaj Thing, Imogen Heap, Four Tet, and James Yorkston. He was also one of the few producers chosen by Radio 1's Rob Da Bank to remix film director David Lynch's first electronica release, \"Good Day Today\" / \"I Know\", which was released on Sunday Best Records.\n\nHopkins signed to Domino Recording Company in late 2008. Hopkins's third album, \"Insides\", was released by Domino Records on 5 May 2009. It included the track \"Light Through the Veins\", which had previously been used on the Coldplay album, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\". Some of the tracks had been written by Hopkins sporadically since his last release, while others were based on the music he had composed for the \"Entity\" production. Hopkins developed an intense live show to support the release, resulting in club and festival performances across Europe and the United States. He secured supporting slots with The xx, Röyksopp, and Four Tet. Many of his live shows used background visuals featuring the animations of Vince Collins.\n\n\"Insides\" charted at no. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Dance/Electronic Albums chart. \"PopMatters\" listed the album as one of the top ten electronic albums of 2009. According to reviews, the album \"takes its cues from ambient electronica, but uses strings and piano, along with some very tasty beats and dubstep-influenced bass on some tracks.\" \"TinyMixTapes\" stated the albumstrikes me as his single most aggressive release yet. His sense of timing, the clarity of his production, and the variety of effects he employs draw you into the story that each instrumental tells. Jon Hopkins is not a button-pushing man of presets; he is a bona fide composer and a trained pianist. Craftsmanship sets him apart, and allows \"Insides\" to be as incredibly moving as it is and always will be. It will easily be one of the best electronic albums of 2009. Paul Clarke of the BBC wrote thatHopkins [is] capable of producing music as epic, soaring and emotional as any power ballad in his own way. Take \"Light Through The Veins\" for example ... a close relative of Ulrich Schnauss' \"In All The Wrong Places\", it's a majestic piece of widescreen shoegazing which grows ever more expansive throughout its entire ten-minute duration ... no amount of reflected glory could ever fully illuminate \"Insides\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> mysterious depths.\n\nIn June 2009 Hopkins was invited by Brian Eno to play some solo shows at the Luminous Festival at the Sydney Opera House. A few weeks prior to leaving, Eno asked Hopkins to join with himself, Underworld's Karl Hyde, Leo Abrahams, and the Sydney-based improv trio The Necks in the group \"Pure Scenius\", the planned finale for the Luminous Festival. They then improvised music based on pre-planned themes, putting on three 1½-hour shows in the Opera House with Hyde on vocals. Pure Scenius was repeated a year later in Brighton, when Eno was curating the Brighton Festival.\n\nIn 2009, Hopkins collaborated with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams to score the Peter Jackson film \"The Lovely Bones.\" In early 2010, Hopkins composed the score for the short film \"Rob and Valentyna in Scotland\" directed by Eric Lynne, which won an honourable mention for the short film-making award at Sundance. Also in 2010 Hopkins was commissioned to create the soundtrack for the British science fiction film \"Monsters\", which was directed by Gareth Edwards. To create the score, Hopkins partly used string parts performed by arranger Davide Rossi and guitar by Leo Abrahams. The soundtrack album was released on 29 November 2010 on Domino Records. In 2011 the score was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Score.\n\nHopkins collaborated with Tunng on the EP \"Seven Gulps of Air\" in 2009, which was commissioned by designer Christopher Kelly for London Fashion Week. \"Seven Gulps of Air\" was listed as one of \"Drowned in Sound\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s singles of the year.\n\nIn 2010 Hopkins collaborated with Leo Abrahams and Brian Eno to create the album \"Small Craft on a Milk Sea\". Released on Warp Records in late 2010, the album is based on a three-week session of improvisation wherein the artists recorded about six hours of material a day.\n\nIn 2011 Hopkins collaborated with Scottish musician King Creosote to create the album \"Diamond Mine\", which featured lyrics and vocals by Creosote sung over musical backdrops arranged and recorded by Hopkins. The album was a culmination of about seven weeks of work spread over seven years of recording and collaboration, from whenever the two artists had the opportunity to get together. The album was released on 28 March 2011 to acclaim, which included a glowing review from NPR. On 19 July 2011 Hopkins and Anderson were announced as nominees for the 2011 Barclaycard Mercury Prize, which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nAlso in 2011, the EP \"Honest Words\", a Hopkins collaboration with King Creosote, was released on Domino Records. In April 2012, this was followed by another collaboration with King Creosote: \"The Jubilee\", also on Domino.\n\nHopkins wrote the score for the 2013 film by Kevin Macdonald, \"How I Live Now\".\n\n\"Immunity\" is Hopkins' fourth studio album, released on 4 June 2013, by Domino Records. Among the artists that contributed vocals were long-time collaborator King Creosote, and Corin Roddick and Megan James of the band Purity Ring. It was recorded and produced in Hopkins' London studio, with Hopkins often using homemade sound effects or the natural sound of the room. Stated \"MixMag\", \"\"Immunity\" is an album of organic techno and exquisite mini-symphonies.\"\n\n\"Immunity\" peaked at no. 13 on Top Electronic Albums by \"Billboard\" in the United States. In Britain it was nominated for the 2013 Mercury Prize for best album. The album met with a largely positive reception among critics, receiving perfect scores from \"Mixmag\" and MusicOMH, and 4/5 from \"The Guardian.\" Pitchfork Media described \"Immunity\" as a \"remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record,\" and MusicOMH called it a \"modern classic\".\n\nThe video for the single 'Open Eye Signal' directed by Aoife McArdle won best cinematography at the UK Music Video Awards.\n\nIn 2014 Hopkins co-produced the song \"Midnight\" for Coldplay's 2014 album \"Ghost Stories\", and released an EP titled \"Asleep Versions\" on 10 November. The EP includes (according to Domino Records) \"four decelerated, dreamlike re-imaginings\" of four tracks featured on his album \"Immunity\". The EP has additional vocals from Raphaelle Standell-Preston of the band Braids & regular collaborator King Creosote, and artwork from Robert Hunter.\n\nHopkin's 5th studio album, titled \"Singularity\", was released on Domino Records on 4 May 2018. On 7 December 2018, it was announced as one of five nominees for the Grammy award for Best Dance/Electronic Album.\n\nHopkins has performed at music festivals such as Moogfest, Mutek, Beacons Festival, and Electric Zoo, and at venues such as Madison Square Garden and the London O2 Arena. As of 2014 he maintains a regular touring schedule both in England and internationally, playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, with upcoming dates at the Pitchfork Music Festival, Electric Picnic and Time Music Festival and in 2015 at Wonderfruit in Thailand for the premiere of the iy_project, a collaboration with light artist, Chris Levine.\n\nAccording to reviews, \"Hopkins's aesthetic is perpetually intriguing. He transcends genres, melding digital coldness with subtle, bucolic textures; veering from skewed elegance to strange, unsettling depths.\" \"He makes powerfully emotive, instrumental music that consistently crosses genres, ranging from solo acoustic piano to explosive, bass-heavy electro.\" Also, he \"meticulously constructs lush, downtempo arrangements, blending digital beats and soothing ambience.\"\n\nAs of September 2010 his studio setup relies on a Logic system, though all his previous releases were on Cubase VST, used in conjunction with an old version of SoundForge. He began using Logic because his old system was not powerful enough to include the video for film soundtracks. His live setup includes Ableton and a chain of up to five Kaoss Pads.\n\nHopkins practices autogenic training and Transcendental Meditation, of which he says, \"For me, it's not about relaxing. It can get music flowing in a way that's really uninhibited, and I want to spend as much time in that place as possible.\"\n\nStudio albums\n\n\n"}

It has a 24 Litre Napier Sea Lion W12 boat engine based on the Napier Lion aeroplane engine (the same as that used in the silver Napier-Railton, which it resembles closely), which develops approximately . The Napier-Bentley is seen at historic racing events mostly in the United Kingdom but has been used at European events. \nWith its red bodywork and Napier-Railton-esque grille, it is spectacular and entertaining in action. Being a W12, the engine has three banks of four very large stub exhausts, one of which points straight out of the side of the car. The sound of the car has been likened to a World War I biplane or cluster or mortar bombs going off. Due to the immense torque of the engine (c.1,400 ft-lbs), the rear tyres can be made to produce clouds of smoke whenever the car is launched, while the exhausts produce sparks, flames and smoke.\nDuring the 30 years that he owned the car Peter Morley and his son, Clive Morley, raced the car frequently until it was sold in 1999. Peter and Clive Morley, as well as Clive's two sons, are still active in racing vintage Bentleys.

Kōzuki had been taken by Toyotomi Hideyoshi the previous year and entrusted to Amago Katsuhisa. When it fell to the Mōri, Amago committed \"hara-kiri\". Amago's loyal and heroic general Yamanaka Yukimori was captured and executed.\n\nIt is popularly believed in Japan that Yamanaka Shikanosuke, Amago's general, \"sold\" Amago's life, for the safety of his own men.\n\nThe Oda forces were so vastly outnumbered and surrounded in the castle that victory was impossible. Yamanaka Shikanosuke sent a message to the Mōri general offering to surrender, and offering the ritual suicide of his master (Amago). The offer was accepted, Amago committed suicide, and his forces surrendered.\n\nWhat precisely happened to Yamanaka Shikanosuke after the battle is unclear. Though some sources say he died in the battle, others state that he became a vassal of the enemy lord, Mōri Terumoto, but was assassinated on Mōri's order (along with his new wife).\n\nAmago Katsuhisa, the Oda vassal lord of Kōzuki Castle, though a member of the samurai class, was not especially experienced or trained as a warrior. Oda Nobunaga was running out of qualified battle-hardened lords to hold his territories, so Katsuhisa was called to Kōzuki from Kyoto, where he was studying to be a Buddhist monk. Katsuhisa was very young, in his early twenties, when he died. A memorial stone stands with his name engraved, along with Buddhist inscriptions, where he took his own life.\n"}

It is located on the Tyne Valley Line (which runs from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle) west of and is managed by Northern.\n\nThe station was constructed by the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (N&CR), and opened on 9 March 1835 as the line's initial eastern terminus. Through running to Redheugh (Gateshead) on the south bank of the River Tyne began in 1837 and the line was completed through to the following year. A second cross-river line via Scotswood to a temporary terminus near the site of was opened in 1839 (diverging immediately east of the station), although it was not until January 1851 that Central station was accessible via this route. It was enlarged on the opening of the Lanchester Valley Extension line in 1867, with Blaydon Junction opening to its east; this enabled trains to run to Blackhill, and through to . The station was substantially rebuilt in 1912 with new red brick station buildings and glass canopies. Passenger services over the Derwent Valley line ended in 1954 and it closed completely in 1963.\n\nIn 1969, Blaydon became an unstaffed station, and the canopies were removed. The station buildings were demolished in 1977 due to neglect and persistent vandalism. Services over the route via the Scotswood Bridge were withdrawn on 4 October 1982 and the line closed (few traces of this now remain, though the position of the station signal box gives a clue as to the old alignment); all services were henceforth diverted over the original 1837 route along the south bank of the Tyne and then onward through , Bensham Junction and then over the King Edward VII Bridge, a route that had previously only been used by freight traffic.\n\nAs noted above, the station is unmanned and has a single ticket machine on the westbound platform. There are basic shelters on both platforms, which are linked by a footbridge. Train running information is offered by timetable posters and audio announcements. Step-free access is possible on both platforms, although the eastbound platform is only accessible via a considerable detour across the adjacent level crossing. There is limited space for car parking adjacent to the westbound platform with further spaces available next to Blaydon Signal box. A pedestrian footbridge links the station with Blaydon Shopping Centre and bus interchange.\n\nUp until the beginning of December 2013, the service there was infrequent compared to others on the line - three services on Monday to Friday to Hexham and three to Newcastle, whilst on Saturdays there were three to Hexham and two to Newcastle & no service at all on Sundays.\n\nIn the December 2013 timetable change, the station began to receive a much improved service with calls every two hours in each direction (by Middlesbrough - Hexham trains) and extra departures at peak times. There was also a Sunday service for the first time since the early 1970s. As of May 2018, the station now receives at least an hourly service during the day in each direction, and half hourly calls at peak times.\n\nThe Office of Rail & Road estimates of station usage attributes the sharp rise in passenger numbers as down to the timetabling improvements.\n"}

The highway connects the northern end of Highway 410 just north of Brampton with Owen Sound on the southern shores of Georgian Bay, passing through the towns of Orangeville and Shelburne as well as several smaller villages along the way. It historically followed the Toronto–Sydenham Road, part of which later became Hurontario Street, as well as Prince of Wales Road.\nThe highway was established in 1920 as one of the original provincial highways. It was extended south by 1937 to Highway 2 in Port Credit. That same year, it became the site of the first interchange in Canada at The Middle Road. Since the late 1990s, the southern end has been truncated to its current terminus north of the Brampton–Caledon border.\n\nHighway 10 follows a route originally carved through the virgin forests of Upper Canada in 1848. Its route has remained largely unchanged since that time, and the highway still divides many of the towns it serves, with the exception of Orangeville, which it has been routed around. It acts as the meridian for the Regional Municipality of Peel; parallel sidelines are divided into \"East\" and \"West\" in several cases by the highway.\n\nBeginning at its southern end in Caledon, Highway 10, following the Hurontario Street alignment, passes to the west of Valleywood, a suburban community on the fringe of the Greater Toronto Area. The highway presses northwest and rises gently over the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve. Immediately to the west are the Forks of the Credit, a deep glacial ravine and provincial park regarded for its scenery. The highway passes between several large quarries and enters Caledon Village. Continuing, it reaches Orangeville at Highway 9. The highway passes to the east of Orangeville on a bypass, switching between the Hurontario St. and Prince of Wales Rd. alignments, avoiding the business district. At the north end of the bypass, the highway curves and proceeds directly north towards the village of Primrose at Highway 89.\n\nHighway 10 turns west, becoming concurrent with Highway 89 for a short distance, into the town of Shelburne. The concurrency ends in the centre of Shelburne, as Highway 10 splits and turns north and then resumes its northwesterly course. From Shelburne to Owen Sound, the road follows the northernmost part of the former Toronto–Sydenham Road, a colonization road that predates the division of the land in this area. As such, the road follows a diagonal path to the survey grid. It briefly merges with Ontario Highway 6 in Owen Sound before it ends, while Highway 6 goes on to Tobermory.\n\nHistorically, Highway 10 follows the 19th-century stagecoach route known as the Toronto–Sydenham Road (the southern half of which later became absorbed into Hurontario Street), which travelled north from Dundas Street (later Highway 5) in Cooksville through Brampton, Orangeville and Shelburne to Owen Sound. It was first designated as a provincial highway on February 26, 1920 when the newly formed Department of Highways assumed the road. It was later extended south when the provincial government assumed the remaining stretch to Lakeshore Road (Highway 2) in Port Credit, on the north shore of Lake Ontario. At that point, the total length of the highway was 166 km.\n\nThe highway formerly turned west onto Highway 9 and ran concurrently with it through downtown Orangeville along Broadway, then turned north to follow First Street (the Prince of Wales Road alignment). In 1968, the bypass around Orangeville was completed, bypassing a short section of the Hurontario Street alignment, which is today a dead end providing access to a hotel.\nIn 1998, due to the combination of increasing urbanization and the presence of the parallel Highway 410 (and a short north-south section of Highway 403) through most of the corridor, the provincial government repealed the connecting link agreement for the southernmost 31 km of the highway running through Brampton and Mississauga, which was already effectively under the control of their respective municipal governments. However, the street is still often colloquially referred to by the former highway number in these cities.\nIn 2009, Highway 410 was connected to Highway 10 about 500 metres north of Highway 10's southernmost terminus at the border of Brampton. The 500-metre \"orphaned\" segment is now discontinuous, and while still technically part of the highway, is only linked to the rest of the highway via a connecting road, and is signed only as \"Hurontario Street\" rather than with both the street name and highway number.\n\nAlso in 2009, a major project to widen two-lane sections of the southern portions of the highway was completed, and the highway is now four lanes wide from Highway 410 north to Camilla. From Shelburne north to Owen Sound, it remains a two-lane highway with several passing lanes in hillier regions.\n\nDuring winter, the northern stretches of the highway that pass through the snowbelt region of Grey County are subject to poor visibility and road closings during windy conditions or winter storms.\n\n \n\nHurontario Street\n\n\n"}

He has been the editor of numerous newspapers and has authored five books.\n\nSiderov was born in 1956 in Yambol, Bulgaria. He received an undergraduate degree in Applied Photography in Sofia, and before the fall of Communism in 1989, worked at the National Literature Museum as a photographer.\nHis brother, Dr. Plamen Siderov, is a mathematician and lectures at Sofia University.\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, Siderov became a member of the newly established Movement for Human Rights. During the fall of 1990, he became the editor-in-chief of \"Democracy\" (), the official newspaper of the Union of Democratic Forces (Siderov played a major role in establishing the paper as the official publication of the right-wing party).\n\nAt one point he was appointed deputy editor-in-chief of \"Monitor\", a newspaper of a political orientation that could be described as nationalist and conservative. In 2000, Siderov was presented with the award of the Union of the Bulgarian Journalists. Later, he came to be the host of \"Attack\", a talk show on the Bulgarian cable TV channel \"SKAT\".\n\nIn 2002 Siderov was invited to a controversial anti-globalisation conference in Moscow where he associated with people like Ahmed Rami and David Duke.\n\nDuring the 2003 local elections Siderov ran for mayor of Sofia on the ticket of the marginal National Association-BZNS Party. He received 1,728 votes, or 0.45%. That attempt passed largely unnoticed for the general public.\n\nDuring the June 2005 parliamentary elections, already a popular TV host, Siderov organised and led the party \"Attack\", named after his talk show. The party won 8.14% (296,848 votes) of the total vote, thus becoming the 4th largest party in parliament. In the 2009 elections Attack won 9.4% (395,000 votes) of the total vote.\n\nSiderov reportedly espouses anti-Masonic conspiracy theories, claiming that Masons control the world through puppet regimes, international organizations, and the press. According to Siderov, these forces seek to commit genocide against Bulgarian people. Attack opposes the membership of Bulgaria in NATO; Siderov has declared that the people were lied to, that Bulgaria would be the safest place by then Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs—Solomon Pasi—but the result was reducing the Bulgarian army to 20,000 troops and in necessity Bulgaria would be defenseless as the Turkish government wants. He compared the accession of Bulgaria to NATO as a new signing of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, considered as humiliating treaty for Bulgaria, signed after World War I. Although the party is ambivalent on Bulgaria's European Union membership, it has demanded a revision of some of the previous agreements (e.g. the resolution on shutting down the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant near the Danube), it claims that those who signed the EU membership, referring to Meglena Kuneva and others, are national traitors, not because of the EU membership itself, but because of the \"anti-Bulgarian\" agreements, on which it is signed. Siderov expressed respect to the Russian president Vladimir Putin, by visiting him on foot for his 60th birthday on 7 October 2012. On 8 March 2013 Siderov paid tribute to the deceased president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez at the Bolivarian republic's embassy in Sofia, where he called the revolutionary an 'example for the Bulgarian patriots as a statesman'.\n\nAttack insists on the cancellation of Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and the returning of the Western Outlands to Bulgaria, annexed by Yugoslavia after the First World War, which consists of the regions of Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad in Serbia, whose population according to the Serbian national census is predominantly ethnic Bulgarian, and of the region of Strumica in Republic of Macedonia. Siderov said that the treaty is invalid, because it was signed with Yugoslavia in 1919, a vanished state, and does not refer to the present-day Serbia or to the Republic of Macedonia and should be cancelled.\n\nThe first statement ever of Volen Siderov from the parliamentary tribune, for a plan for a giant genocide of the Bulgarian nation, coming from abroad: \nIn September 2018, Siderov met with Israeli MK Oren Hazan, a member of the Likud party, during the latter's visit to Bulgaria. Hazan defended the meeting by noting that Siderov \"said he apologized for what he had said\" about the Holocaust in the past, and Hazan then \"told him he needed to do it publicly\".\n\nSiderov has generated increasing controversy as Attack has improved at the polls. He has been labeled xenophobic, and his persona has been called \"a studied imitation of Hitler\". He has criticised the \"symbiotic relationship\" between established political parties and organised criminal groups. He has also spoken against the purportedly \"widespread discrimination\" against majority ethnic Bulgarians by their own state, particularly in relation to the alleged non-prosecution by the state of crimes committed by ethnic minorities and the supposed free provision to certain ethnic groups of social services that have been denied to ordinary Bulgarians.\n\nSiderov and his party \"Attack\" were among the few Bulgarian political forces that opposed the closing of the four units of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. Units 1 and 2 were taken shut down in the end of 2003 and units 3 and 4 were taken out of operation in the final hours of 2006, immediately prior to the country's accession to the European Union.\n\nIn February 2007, the newspaper \"168 Hours\" published claims that the Movement for Rights and Freedoms has paid BGN 1.6 million to \"Attack\". On 23 February 2007 Volen Siderov appeared in the offices of \"168 Hours\", and asked for an explanation, which was not provided. Attack is suing the newspaper for libel.\n\nFrom time to time Siderov is involved in scandals that include hooliganism.\n\nDuring a televised debate in the show \"Referendum\" on Bulgarian National Television (BNT), after arriving late, Siderov questioned the sexual orientation of IMRO leader Angel Dzhambazki, as well as Krasimir Karakachanov's property deals and alluded to what he alleged was underhanded support by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms for the nationalist IMRO party. He continued to speak even after being told to stop by moderators and even after his microphone was turned off. Gendarmerie officers arrived on scene to escort Siderov out of the studio and he was subsequently banned from appearing on the BNT by the channel's management. Bulgaria's council for electronic media referred the case to the country's Central Electoral Commission in an attempt to revoke Siderov's right to access free media packages, which are given to parties in the run-up to elections. Siderov reacted to these actions by accusing the network of censorship.\n\nSiderov ran for President in the 2006 presidential election. In the first round on 22 October he received 21% of the vote and qualified for the runoff on 29 October against incumbent Georgi Parvanov, who had 65%. Parvanov was not declared the winner after the first round because, in accordance with Bulgarian electoral law, at least 50% of all registered voters had to take part in the first round for that. Mainstream right-wing parties in Bulgaria (the UDF and the DSB) refused to back any of the candidates, despite appeals by many observers, notably by fellow conservative and European People's Party chairman Hans-Gert Pöttering, to support Parvanov (the situation was commonly compared with the way French left voters supported mainstream right-wing candidate Jacques Chirac against far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002). The centrist National Movement for Simeon II ultimately decided to back Parvanov. Meanwhile, some far left formations called their sympathizers to support Siderov. In the second round he lost, receiving about 24% of the vote.\n\nIn September 2019, Siderov announced his resignation from Bulgaria's National Assembly, in order to run for the post of mayor of Sofia, Bulgaria's capital and largest city, in the 2019 Bulgarian local elections.\n\nDuring his election campaign he promised that, if elected, he would stop the use of municipal tow trucks for forcefully moving incorrectly parked cars, as well as ban any gay parades, such as Sofia Pride, from being held in the city. Siderov claimed that homosexuality itself \"did not interest\" him and that homosexuals could have a private party instead, as he deemed the gay parade was only costing the Sofia Municipality excess money, as the local police is charged with guarding the event. He also stated that he would attempt to save money by creating a local, municipal-run construction company, which would handle public works, instead of auctioning them off to private companies. Siderov believes that with these measures, he could fund free bus passes for all retirees and schoolkids in Sofia. He further pledged to \"crush\" street gangs and organized crime in Sofia in only 3 months, stating that voters were free to \"have his head\" if he did not fulfill this promise in time. Adding that he thought Sofia needed its own Viktor Orbán, he further stated that he believed candidates for mayor should resign their previous posts before standing for election, as he had done with his position in the national assembly. For this reason, he praised Maya Manolova, who resigned from her position as National Ombudsman to run for Mayor of Sofia, but criticised Angel Dzhambazki, another candidate for the position, who refused to give up his seat in the European Parliament.\n\nDuring the vote counting process, he arrived at Arena Armeec, where the votes were being tallied, and insisted he be allowed in to monitor the process. He was denied entry by the policemen guarding the arena and left after a long argument with the authorities, which told him that Bulgarian electoral law makes no provision for political candidates to monitor the counting process. He finished seventh with 1.44% of the vote.\n\nSiderov's hobby is collecting books and various map types related to Bulgaria.\n\n\n"}

He idolised Jim Laker, for which reason he was nicknamed \"Jim\" for a time.\n\nIn his third first-class match, he hit 169 for Jamaica against the touring Australians in 1954–55, and was immediately included in the side for the First Test. He started his Test career scoring 104 on debut against Australia. But after a \"pair\" in the next match, he was dropped. He returned for the Fourth and Fifth Tests, and finished the series with 206 runs at 25.75 and 5 wickets at 68.00.\n\nHe toured New Zealand in 1955–56, scoring 64 in the First Test and putting on 162 for the fourth wicket with Everton Weekes in 100 minutes. He was less successful with the bat in the next three Tests, finishing the series with 78 runs at 15.60, but his off-spin brought 13 wickets at 18.53, including 2 for 1 and 4 for 75 in the Second Test.\n\nIn England in 1957, he scored 161 in the First Test and 168 in the Third Test, once driving Brian Statham into the car park. He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year; in his citation he was praised for his batting, bowling, and \"magnificent fielding\".\n\nIn 1957–58 he made 283 runs at 47.16 and took 13 wickets at 38.00 against Pakistan in the West Indies. In India in 1958–59 he scored 287 runs at 35.87 and took 9 wickets at 29.66. In the Fifth Test at Delhi he scored 100 and took 3 for 94 and 5 for 90. In the three Tests in Pakistan he was less successful, scoring 81 runs at 16.20 and taking 3 wickets at 20.00.\n\nDuring 1958 and 1959 he played for Burnley in the Lancashire League where in 1959 he set a league record of 306*. He died from injuries sustained in a car accident in 1959 at the age of 26.\n\nThe accident happened at 4:45am on 7 September, while he was travelling with his West Indian teammates Garry Sobers and Tom Dewdney. They were driving to London to attend a charity match, Sobers being the driver. The trip had already been delayed because of the traffic. The car ran into a 10-ton cattle truck driven by a Mr. Andrew Saunders. The accident happened on the A34 near Stone in Staffordshire.\n\nSmith was sleeping in the back seat and was thrown forward. His injuries seemed minor initially and Smith even told Sobers, in reference to Dewdney, \"Don't worry about me. Look after the big fellow.\" But his spine was injured badly and he soon went into a coma. He died without regaining consciousness three days later. His body was taken to Jamaica where 60,000 people attended the funeral. His tombstone in Jamaica's May Pen Cemetery is engraved: \"Keen Cricketer, Unselfish Friend, Worthy Hero, Loyal Disciple, Happy Warrior.\" Sobers and Dewdney were not seriously injured, suffering lacerations and bruises.\n\nSobers was issued with a notice of intended prosecution. On 11 November at Stone Magistrates' Court, Sobers was found guilty of careless driving. The prosecutor said that Sobers had failed to take a bend and was in collision with a cattle truck travelling in the opposite direction. Sobers was fined £10 with £16 17s costs and had his licence suspended for a month. Sobers pleaded not guilty, claiming that he had been dazzled by oncoming headlights.\n\nA biography titled \"The Happy Warrior\" was written by Ken Chaplin a year after Smith's death. He had the nicknames \"Mighty Mouse\" and \"Wayside Preacher\" because he liked reading the lesson in church.\n\nThe road passing Boys Town Club in Trench Town, Smith's birthplace, is named Collie Smith Drive in his memory.\n\n\n"}

It was initially intended to be the follow-up to his 2002 album, \"Up\", though, in October 2011, Gabriel stated that he had not actually completed the recording of any songs for \"I/O\" and that the project was merely a set of \"song ideas\" which remain unfinished.\n\nThe history of \"I/O\" is closely connected to that of making the album \"Up\", which notoriously took Gabriel almost 10 years to complete, with some of the songs being first recorded during the \"Us\" recording sessions. After the Secret World Live World Tour, Gabriel spent much of the 1990s writing new material, and in interviews circa 2002 he said that four albums would come out of this period of writing (he reportedly wrote and prepared over 130 songs during this time, of which ten were selected for \"Up\").\n\nOriginally the album was set to be released in 2004, or 18 months apart from \"Up\", yet extensive touring (the \"Growing Up Live\" and \"Still Growing Up Live\" tours in 2003 and 2004) pushed the release far ahead.\n\nAccording to a \"Rolling Stone\" magazine article, Gabriel has 150 songs in various stages, which he has been working on with engineer Richard Chappell and percussionist Ged Lynch. He has also talked about the possibility of completing the songs, arranging them for a band, touring first and only then recording and releasing them. He has also said of a tour possibility: \"I would like to try maybe just me and a percussionist, or a percussionist and bass. It's good sometimes to let go of your crutches.\"\n\nIn the last quarter of 2008, Gabriel (via his monthly Moon Club Video Updates on his official website) mentioned that he has been back in the studio on a more regular basis, shifting focus toward the recording of \"I/O\" and his covers project \"Scratch My Back\" (which was released in 2010). However, as of March 2012, Gabriel announced on his video updates that he has been working on twelve \"brand new\" song ideas, leaving the future of the \"I/O\" recordings unclear.\n\nIn 2013, Gabriel uploaded pictures of himself and Ged Lynch in the recording studio. While a release date has not been announced, Gabriel intended to put more focus on this project before committing to anything else. \"I really need to stop doing other things and lock myself away for a while. It probably hasn’t moved nearly as much as I would have liked to in the intervening time. The songs are still there, but some of them I would redo now and there’s some new stuff as well. I keep arranging until the cows come home, which is sometimes a weakness\".\n\nThroughout 2015 and 2016, Gabriel posted multiple Facebook and Instagram posts about working on the new album. In March 2018, Gabriel posted on his Facebook that the new album was in the \"comping\" stage. In April 2019, Gabriel stated on BBC Radio that he was working on about 50 ideas, with the intention of finishing the songs by the end of 2019 to then \"open then up to the band\" by early next year then \"get a record out\".\n\n"}

Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not sufficiently disabling. Later the meaning of the crime expanded to encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any instrument.\n\nIn England and Wales, it has fallen into disuse. In 1992 the Law Commission recommended that it be abolished, and in 1998 the Home Office proposed to abolish it, in the course of codifying the law relating to offences against the person.\n\nThe most significant change in common-law mayhem doctrine came in 1697, when the King's Bench decided \"Fetter v. Beale\", 91 Eng. Rep. 1122. There, the plaintiff recovered in a battery action against a defendant. Shortly thereafter, \"part of his skull by reason of the said battery came out of his head\", and the plaintiff brought a subsequent action under mayhem. Though \"Fetter\" is also known as an early example of res judicata, it is most significant for expanding the ambit of mayhem to include \"loss of the skull\".\n\nIn modern times, the offense of mayhem has been superseded in many jurisdictions by statutorily defined offenses such as aggravated battery.\n\nModern statutes in the U.S. define mayhem as disabling or disfiguring, such as rendering useless a member of another person's arms or legs. The injury must be permanent, not just a temporary loss. Some courts will hold even a minor battery as mayhem if the injury is not minor. Mayhem in the U.S. is a felony in all states and jurisdictions, including federal. In the states of California, Vermont and Oklahoma, mayhem is punishable by up to life imprisonment. In other states where laws defining mayhem (or maiming) are in place, the maximum punishment for mayhem is generally around 10 to 20 years, and mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment may also apply, depending on the laws of the state. If mayhem was committed in an aggravated fashion, such as in the case of where it resulted in permanent disability or disfigurement, the punishment is generally much more severe, and may even include life imprisonment. For example, simple mayhem in California is punishable by two to eight years in prison, whereas aggravated mayhem (where permanent injuries result) is punishable by up to life imprisonment.\n\nBoth the noun \"mayhem\" and the verb \"maim\" come from Old French via Anglo-Norman. The word is first attested in various Romance languages in the 13th century, but its ultimate origin is unclear. For one hypothesis about its origin, see the Wiktionary entry for this word.\n\nMayhem can describe a person going on a rampage, and is also used as a synonym for \"chaos\". Popular misunderstanding of the common journalese expression \"rioting and mayhem\" caused the common usual modern use of \"mayhem\" to mean \"havoc and disorder\", often with humorous overtones.\n\n"}

On 24 November 2001, the Crossair Avro RJ100 operating the route, registration crashed into a wooded range of hills near Bassersdorf and caught fire, killing 24 of the 33 people on board.\n\nThe accident aircraft, a British-made Avro 146-RJ100, registration HB-IXM, was manufactured in 1996 and logged more than 13,000 hours and 11,500 cycles in total before the crash. The aircraft was powered by four Lycoming LF507-1F turbofan engines.\n\nThe flight departed Berlin Tegel Airport at 21:01 CET with 28 passengers, three flight attendants, and the cockpit crew of Captain Hans Ulrich Lutz (57) and First Officer Stefan Löhrer (25). Lutz was an extremely experienced pilot with more than 19,500 flight hours – approximately 19,300 of which were as pilot in command. Löhrer, in contrast, was inexperienced with just 490 total flight hours.\n\nSwissair, a major shareholder in Crossair, had been grounded about a month before the crash as a result of financial difficulties.\n\nUpon arrival at Zürich about an hour after takeoff, the pilots were cleared for an ILS approach to runway 14, but were switched to a VOR/DME approach to runway 28 because of a noise law restriction after 10:00 PM. There were poor visibility conditions due to low clouds, and the cockpit voice recorder captured the transmission of a previously landing Crossair flight informing the tower that they could not see the runway until away. At 22:07 CET, the airplane crashed into a wooded range of hills near the small town of Bassersdorf, around short of the runway, where it broke apart and went up in flames. Twenty-four people died (including the cockpit crew and a flight attendant), while nine (seven passengers and two flight attendants) survived.\n\nThe ill-fated flight was carrying a total of 33 people, 5 crew members and 28 passengers were onboard.\n\nAmong the passengers were Melanie Thornton, the American lead singer of the German-based Eurodance group La Bouche; she was killed in the crash.\n\nThe Eurodance group Passion Fruit was among those who were onboard flight 3597; singers Nathaly(ie) van het Ende and Maria Serrano Serrano were killed, while singer Debby St. Maarten and the band's manager survived with injuries. St. Maarten's injuries were classified as \"severe\".\n\nWhile Captain Lutz was an experienced pilot, his competence came under close scrutiny during the course of the investigation, which concluded that the accident was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) caused by a series of pilot errors and navigation mistakes that led the plane off-course. This course deviation caused the plane to crash into a hilltop, short of and north of its assigned landing strip, runway 28.\n\nFlight 3597 had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14, the main landing runway at Zürich, a runway equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS) that provides vertical and lateral guidance to the runway. The CVR records Lutz and Löhrer discussing \"the 14 approach\" as well as Lutz's request that Löhrer call out the height when the plane reaches 100 feet above DA (Decision Altitude – The altitude at which an immediate decision to land or initiate a missed approach must be made). However, Flight 3597 was behind schedule and would not reach Zürich until after 22:00 CET. This delay forced Flight 3597 to change its landing plan. Zürich Air Traffic Control Tower, in order to comply with a new Swiss law designed to reduce airport noise from approaching aircraft over southern Germany in the late evening hours, must redirect all flights on final approach to switch from the ILS-equipped runway 14 to the less-accurate VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)-equipped runway 28. This runway change forced Captain Lutz to abandon his planned ILS approach and required First Officer Löhrer to consult the Jeppesen charts for runway 28. The charts included a new set of approach parameters, of which the higher MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude) was the most crucial piece of information.\n\nThe MDA states the minimum altitude in MSL to safely fly above any obstructions or terrain in the final approach flight-path before visual contact with the runway is made. Unlike a DA in a Precision Approach, an MDA requires that after crossing the Final Approach Fix, the pilot is to descend and maintain MDA until the non-flying pilot reports that the runway is in sight, allowing the pilot to safely complete the landing visually. In contrast to the ILS approach, which displays lateral and vertical position, the VOR/DME approach only shows the lateral position of the aircraft and its range to the runway. Due to increased azimuth error associated with the use of VORs and lack of vertical guidance (Glide Slope), the MDA is therefore much higher than a DA (Decision Altitude) for an ILS.\n\nAlthough both pilots were based in Zürich and the CVR picks up Lutz's query to Löhrer about Löhrer's familiarity with \"the 28 approach\", which Löhrer confirmed he had, Lutz put the plane into an overly-steep descent that brought flight 3597 to MDA far too soon. When Löhrer reported the plane reaching 100 feet above MDA, the CVR records Lutz asking Löhrer, \"Do we have ground contact?\" Löhrer hesitated before replying \"Yes\". However, flight simulators programmed with the time of day, terrain, and weather Lutz was facing at that time allowed investigators to determine that the only ground Lutz or Löhrer could see was the ground of the hilly terrain over which the plane was flying. Upon reaching MDA of , Lutz declared that he had \"ground contact\" and would continue on, then deliberately descended the plane below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway, a major piloting error that ultimately led directly to the crash. The fact that Löhrer made no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude also directly contributed to the crash. Lutz made an additional error by not monitoring his Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) as he made his approach; the CVR recorded Lutz's running narrative on nearly every move he made in the cockpit, but did not record any readout of the DME after a check, verified by Löhrer, at from runway 28. Moments before the crash, Lutz's running commentary indicated to investigators that Lutz must have thought he was at or near from runway 28 because he said \"Someone said he saw the runway late here\". Instead, Lutz was over from the runway, and could not possibly have seen the runway due to the presence of a hill, below the MDA of , that would have obscured his view. It was into this hill that Flight 3597 eventually crashed. Just before the crash, the synthetic voice of the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) announced the radio altimeter reading 500 feet above ground. Immediately thereafter Lutz exclaimed \"*****, two miles he said, he sees the runway\". A few seconds later Lutz said \"Two thousand\" and then one second later the synthetic voice gave the \"minimums\" GPWS message, which was triggered by the radio altimeter reading at 300 feet. Even though Lutz finally realized that his inability to see the runway meant he needed to initiate a missed approach maneuver (called a \"go-around\"), his call for the go-around came too late; the plane's engines were not able to spool up fast enough to generate sufficient thrust to climb above the hill that had been obstructing his view, and the plane crashed into the hilltop at 22:06 CET.\n\nThe report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures on previous occasions, but no action had been taken by the airline to remove him from transporting passengers. Lutz had twice failed to upgrade his flight certifications to the more complex MD-80 due to insufficient comprehension of its computerized navigational systems. The report also documented Lutz's role in causing the total loss of a Crossair Saab 340 by retracting its landing gear while it was still on the apron, which led to Crossair relieving him of his training captain duties in 1991.\n\nIn spite of those demonstrated deficiencies, however, Crossair continued to allow Lutz to fly passengers (reportedly due to a shortage of qualified Crossair pilots), and Lutz continued to demonstrate his overall deficiencies as a line pilot. These included a near-miss incident on final approach to Lugano Airport where Lutz came within of colliding with the shore of a lake during his final descent and a navigational error during a sightseeing tour over the Alps that took the flight far off its course to Sion, Switzerland. In this particular incident, Lutz missed his approach into Sion and circled over what he thought was Sion's airport for several minutes before passengers spotted road signs in Italian; the navigation error had taken them over the St. Bernard Pass through the Alps, and the airport they had been circling was in fact located near Aosta, Italy.\n\nThe final report of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB, German acronym BFU) states that other factors also contributed to the accident:\n\n\nThe hourlong Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series \"Mayday\" featured the crash in a Season 10 episode titled \"Cockpit Failure\".\n\n\n"}

He wrote numerous screenplays for the films he produced, often under the pseudonym Peter Welbeck. He produced over 80 feature films and continued to write and produce well into his 80s. Towers was married to the actress Maria Rohm, who appeared in many of his films.\n\nThe son of a theatrical agent, he was born in Wandsworth, and became a child actor. He then became a prolific radio writer while serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II becoming head of the RAF radio unit on the British Forces Broadcasting Service attaining the rank of Pilot Officer. \n\nIn 1946, he and his mother Margaret Miller Towers started a company called Towers of London that sold various syndicated radio shows around the world, including \"The Lives of Harry Lime\" and \"The Black Museum\" with Orson Welles, \"Secrets of Scotland Yard\" with Clive Brook, \"Horatio Hornblower\" in which Michael Hordern played the famous character created by C.S. Forester, and a series based on the Sherlock Holmes stories, featuring John Gielgud as Holmes, Ralph Richardson as Watson, and Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty.\n\nBased on his radio success, in the mid-1950s he produced television shows for ITV such as \"Armchair Theatre\", \"The Golden Fleece\", \"The Boy About the Place\", \"Teddy Gang\", \"The Lady Asks for Help\", \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\", \"The Suicide Club\", \"The Little Black Book\", \"The New Adventures of Martin Kane\", \"A Christmas Carol\", \"24 Hours a Day\", \"Down to the Sea\", \"Gun Rule\", and many others.\n\nOn 7 April 1956, \"Billboard\" magazine announced J. Elroy McCaw's Gotham Broadcasting Corporation Radio WINS AM New York made a deal with Harry Alan Towers for deejay Alan Freed to do a special taped 1/2 hour rock 'n' roll record show on Saturday nights over Radio Luxembourg, which beamed to most of the countries of Free Europe.\n\nTowers began producing feature films in 1962, sometimes writing the screenplay. Towers filmed in various countries such as South Africa, Ireland, Hong Kong, Bulgaria and others. A number of his films and scripts were based on the works of Sax Rohmer, such as \"Sumuru\" and the popular \"Fu Manchu\" series of five films starring Christopher Lee. He also adapted the novels of Agatha Christie (\"And Then There Were None\" and the Miss Marple series), the Marquis de Sade, and the works of Edgar Wallace. In fact, Towers produced three separate film versions of \"And Then There Were None\", each set in a different locale.\n\nHe frequently collaborated with director Jesus Franco during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Towers had a hand in writing and/or producing numerous films directed by Franco, including \"99 Women\" (1969), \"The Girl from Rio\" a.k.a. \"Rio 70\" (1969), \"Venus in Furs\" (1969), \"\" (1969), \"Eugenie… The Story of Her Journey into Perversion\" (1970), \"The Bloody Judge\" (1970), and \"Count Dracula\" (1970). Franco also helmed the last two Fu Manchu films \"The Blood of Fu Manchu\" (1968) and \"The Castle of Fu Manchu\" (1969).\n\nIn 1961 Towers, with girlfriend Mariella Novotny, was charged with operating a vice ring at a New York hotel, but he jumped bail and returned to Europe. Novotny, in her statement to the FBI, claimed Towers was a Soviet agent responsible for providing compromising information on individuals for the benefit of the U.S.S.R. \"Lobster Magazine\" ran an article in 1983 citing sources who alleged Towers was linked with (among others) Stephen Ward, Peter Lawford, the Soviet Union, and a vice ring at the United Nations. Hearst Corporation newspapers had already mentioned Towers' name in a 1963 article featuring coded references to a liaison between a pre-White House John F. Kennedy and Novotny, a known prostitute. The charges against Towers were dropped in 1980 after he paid a £4,200 fine for jumping bail.\n\nIn his last months, Towers was working with Ken Russell on an adaptation of \"Moll Flanders\". He died after a short illness in a hospital in Canada on 31 July 2009.\n\n\n"}

The game was the brainchild of Gus Greenlee, owner of the Pittsburgh Crawfords. In 1933 he decided to match the Major League Baseball All-Star Game with Negro league players. Newspaper balloting was set up to allow the fans to choose the starting lineups for that first game, a tradition that continued through the series' end in 1962. Unlike the white All-Star game which is played near the middle of the season, the Negro All-Star game was held toward the end of the season.\n\nBecause league structures were shaky during the Great Depression and also because certain teams (notably the Kansas City Monarchs and the Homestead Grays) sometimes played entirely independent of the leagues, votes were not counted by league, but by geographical location. Hence, the games were known as the \"East-West All-Star Games\". Votes were tallied by two of the major African-American weekly newspapers of the day, the \"Chicago Defender\" and the \"Pittsburgh Courier\".\n\nAll games were held at Comiskey Park in Chicago unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2299386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299386", "title": "Lisfranc injury", "text": "Lisfranc injury\n\nLisfranc injury, also known as Lisfranc fracture, is an injury of the foot in which one or more of the metatarsal bones are displaced from the tarsus. \n\nThe injury is named after Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin (2 April 179013 May 1847), a French surgeon and gynecologist who noticed this fracture pattern amongst cavalry men, in 1815, after the War of the Sixth Coalition.\n\nThe midfoot consists of five bones that form the arches of the foot (the cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones) and their articulations with the bases of the five metatarsal bones, and these articulations are damaged in a Lisfranc injury. Such injuries typically involve the ligaments between the medial cuneiform bone and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones, and each of these ligaments is called Lisfranc ligament.\n\nLisfranc injuries are caused when excessive kinetic energy is applied either directly or indirectly to the midfoot and are often seen in traffic collisions or industrial accidents.\n\nDirect Lisfranc injuries are usually caused by a crush injury, such as a heavy object falling onto the midfoot, or the foot being run over by a car or truck, or someone landing on the foot after a fall from a significant height. Indirect Lisfranc injuries are caused by a sudden rotational force on a plantar flexed (downward pointing) forefoot. Examples of this type of trauma include a rider falling from a horse but the foot remaining trapped in the stirrup, or a person falling forward after stepping into a storm drain.\n\nIn athletic trauma, Lisfranc injuries occur commonly in activities such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, wakeboarding, or snowboarding (where appliance bindings pass directly over the metatarsals). American football players occasionally acquire this injury, and it most often occurs when the athlete's foot is plantar flexed and another player lands on the heel. This can also be seen in pivoting athletic positions such as a baseball catcher or a ballerina spinning.\n\nIn a high energy injury to the midfoot, such as a fall from a height or a motor vehicle accident, the diagnosis of a Lisfranc injury should, in theory at least, pose less of a challenge. There will be deformity of the midfoot and X-ray abnormalities should be obvious. Further, the nature of the injury will create heightened clinical suspicion and there may even be disruption of the overlying skin and compromise of the blood supply. Typical X-ray findings would include a gap between the base of the first and second toes. The diagnosis becomes more challenging in the case of low energy incidents, such as might occur with a twisting injury on the racquetball court, or when an American Football lineman is forced back upon a foot that is already in a fully plantar flexed position. Then, there may only be complaint of inability to bear weight and some mild swelling of the forefoot or midfoot. Bruising of the arch has been described as diagnostic in these circumstances but may well be absent. Typically, conventional radiography of the foot is utilized with standard non-weight bearing views, supplemented by weight bearing views which may demonstrate widening of the interval between the first and second toes, if the initial views fail to show abnormality. Unfortunately, radiographs in such circumstances have a sensitivity of 50% when non-weight bearing and 85% when weight bearing, meaning that they will appear normal in 15% of cases where a Lisfranc injury actually exists. In the case of apparently normal x-rays, if clinical suspicion remains, advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a logical next step.\n\nThere are three classifications for the fracture:\n\nOptions include operative or non-operative treatment. One study claims that in athletes, and if the dislocation is less than 2 mm, the fracture can be managed with casting for six weeks. The person's injured limb cannot bear weight during this period. In the majority of cases early anatomical reduction and stable fixation is indicated. A 2005 study suggests that closed reduction and Kirschner wire (K-wire) stabilisation or open reduction and stabilisation - generally using screws to avoid the complication of K-wires and maintain a stable reduction - are the treatments of choice.\n\nAccording to a 1997 study, for severe Lisfranc injuries, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and temporary screw or Kirschner wire fixation is the treatment of choice. The foot cannot be allowed to bear weight for a minimum of six weeks. Partial weight-bearing may then begin, with full weight bearing after an additional several weeks, depending on the specific injury. K-wires are typically removed after six weeks, before weight bearing, while screws are often removed after 12 weeks. \n\nWhen a Lisfranc injury is characterized by significant displacement of the tarsometatarsal joint(s), nonoperative treatment often leads to severe loss of function and long-term disability secondary to chronic pain and sometimes to a planovalgus deformity. In cases with severe pain, loss of function, or progressive deformity that has failed to respond to nonoperative treatment, mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis (operative fusion of the bones) may be indicated.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin encountered a soldier who suffered from vascular compromise and secondary gangrene of the foot after a fall from a horse. Subsequently, Lisfranc performed an amputation at the level of the tarsometatarsal joints, and that area of the foot has since been eponymously referred to as the \"Lisfranc joint\". Although Lisfranc did not describe a specific mechanism of injury or classification scheme, a Lisfranc injury has come to mean a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints.\n\n"}

{"id": "2299396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299396", "title": "Gay Shame", "text": "Gay Shame\n\nGay Shame is a movement from within the queer communities described as a radical alternative to gay mainstreaming and directly posits an alternative view of gay pride events and activities which have become increasingly commercialized with corporate sponsors and \"safer\" agendas to avoid offending supporters and sponsors. The Gay Shame movement has grown to embrace radical expression, counter-cultural ideologies, and avant-garde arts and artists.\n\nGay Shame was created as a protest of (and named in opposition to) the overcommercialization of the gay pride events. Members attack \"queer assimilation\" into what they perceive as oppressive societal structures. As such, its members disagree with the legalization of same-sex marriage, stating that:\nGay Shame began in 1998 as an annual event in Brooklyn, New York. Held for a number of years at DUMBA, an artists' run collective center, bands such as Three Dollar Bill and Kiki and Herb and speakers such as Eileen Myles, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore and Penny Arcade appeared at the first event, and the evening was documented by Scott Berry and released as the film \"Gay Shame 98\". \"Swallow Your Pride\" was a zine published by the people involved in planning Gay Shame in New York. Three issues were released. The movement later spread to San Francisco, Toronto, and Sweden.\n\n\"LAGAI – Queer Insurrection\" (formerly \"Lesbians and Gays Against Intervention\") put such a protest in context. They wrote that the \"origins of the LGBTQ movement are revolutionary […] Now, some of the same people who participated in those fabulous outpourings of anti-establishment rage tripped over each other on the way to City Hall to have their love blessed by Gavin Newsom, successor to Dan White and Dianne Feinstein, darling of the developers, persecutor of the homeless, and cause of Gay Shame getting beaten and busted by the cops on more than one occasion.\"\n\nIn 2002, AlterNet published a piece by queer activist Tommi Avicolli Mecca who lived in San Francisco about Gay Shame. What he wrote expressed many of the ideas of Gay Shame:\nIn 2009, according to an article on IndyBay, SF Gay Shame had a protest outside San Francisco's LGBT Center. A press release they put out about the event they wrote:\nThat same year there was an event of London's chapter of Gay Shame, which they had a so-called \"indoor playground of interactive art and alternative ideas...[which was in a] club [that] shares a similar non-commercial, anti-consumerist angle...[and there were] thirty-five sideshows, 100 performance artists and 3,000 revellers.\"\n\nA book titled \"Gay Shame\" was reviewed on Lambda Literary in 2010. The reviewers noted that the book looks at the origins of Gay Shame, the question of gay pride and challenges readers to \"question and explore the possibility that the modern LGBT rights movement's push for acceptance, assimilation, and—they would argue—pride, results in a loss of something importantly queer as it attempts to eradicate shame...[by] exploring the ways in which pride and shame connected with race, gender and sexuality.\"\n\nIn 2011, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore was interviewed by an online publication called We Who Feel Differently. Carlos Motta, the interviewer asked about how to open up spaces, and in a response, Mattilda described her work with Gay Shame:\nGay Shame was also mentioned on Mission Local, the Bay Area Reporter, writer Toshio Meronek on the Huffington Post, a radical magazine titled \"Slingshot\", SF Weekly, Sarah Jaffe on Alternet, in a 7-page article in the Quarterly Journal of Speech and many others.\n\nThe San Francisco Gay Shame became a non-hierarchical direct action and radical queer collective that continued until early 2013 when it petered out. It was also \"primarily responsible for the protests, mobilizations, and guerrilla tactics that shut down the city of San Francisco in response to the declaration of war on Iraq\". An interview posted on the Mission Local website noted that the group began organizing in 2001, doing radical direct action with ideas like the \"Goth Cry-In\" which they described as a \"space for basking in our sadness around the current state of LGBT politics and the horrors of the larger world.\" The group also said that \"the current state of LGBT politics is a scramble for straight privilege\" and that \"things like health care ... should be available to us all ... [but that] a queer identity is about challenging institutions of domination, like marriage and the military, not becoming part of them [because] ... we would be working against traditional institutions and building connections with people that make us feel love, joy, freedom and safety—which in many cases, as we know, is the exact opposite of marriage ... [since] Gay Shame supports gender self-determination in all its manifestations.\"\n\nTheir website described themselves as committed to \"a queer extravaganza that brings direct action to astounding levels of theatricality [that rejects a] commercialized gay identity that denies the intrinsic links between queer struggle and challenging power ... counter[ing] the self-serving 'values' of gay consumerism and ... fighting the rabid assimilationist monster with a devastating mobilization of queer brilliance.\" Despite this, in 2012, according to writer Toshio Meronek, a criticism of the \"corporatization of Pride events has officially gone viral ... [and] that Pride actually started as a day of political action called Christopher Street Liberation Day.\" At one point, after Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed, Gay Shame put out a flier declaring: \"No Gays in the Military! We need you on the streets. Keeping the status quo in check and on fire.\"\n\nAfter the end of the last chapter of Gay Shame, there were some reflections on the movement as a whole. One of the main organizers, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore of this group told the San Francisco Bay Guardian that:\n\nThis is similar to what she said in a radio show in late October 2012 called Horizontal Power Hour.\n\nIn June 2013, an article on \"White Rose Reader\" added to this, noting that: \"Starting in 1998, these “Gay Shame” events promoted counter-cultural ideologies and radical expression...some have picked up on this: a blog popped up recently to demand Gay Shame, started by a 48-year old queer male DJ.\"\n\nIn September 2013, Gay Shame SF or San Francisco Gay Shame, re-emerged. Gay Shame SF describes themselves as a 'Virus in the System,\" declaring a \"new queer activism...to counter the self-serving \"values\" of gay consumerism and the increasingly hypocritical left.\" Organizationally, Gay Shame SF is consensus based, meaning everyone has to agree on decisions before they proceed and that they will make sure everyone is fully informed on the actions that are going to occur. When any member of the group speaks to the press, they will identify as 'Mary' so no one is seen as a leader, incorrectly identified and so that anonymity can be preserved.\n\nMost recently, Gay Shame SF has attracted attention for its prison abolition and anti-gentrification organizing. In 2014, six members of Gay Shame were arrested for protesting a \"prison-themed\" pride party hosted by Kink.com. In an open letter co-signed by queer abolition leaders Miss Major and Angela Davis, Gay Shame demanded that Kink.com change the party's theme, and \"not use themes of arrest and incarceration... in promoting your event.\" In 2015, a series of \"anti-tech\" fliers posted by Gay Shame in the Mission District, San Francisco demanded 'Brogrammers' leave the neighborhood and implied violence.\n\nAdditionally, other chapters have emerged as well. In around May 2013, Gay Shame San Diego emerged, describing itself on a Facebook page as being \"created as a protest to the overcommercialization of pride events and opposes queer assimilation.\" This Facebook page has covered topics ranging from same-sex marriage, Lou Reed, and gay pride. Around the same time, a tumblr of the organization popped up as well repeating the same description on their Facebook page and it has been around ever since. Their tumblr currently has reposted material written by Gay Shame SF, criticized capitalism, spoke about queer and trans liberation, and much more.\n\nDue to the opposition to mainstream LGBTQ culture, some have criticized Gay Shame. Another criticism, from a queer perspective, while praising the group in certain ways, commented: \"...it is difficult for the group to wholly remove themselves from the overarching structure as their ideology demands... By removing individual names, and by extent, individual identities within the group, Gay Shame conforms to the very commercialization it seeks to fight against.\"\n\nAn academic conference at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor occurred in March, 2003. Supposedly, during that weekend, there was friction between the activists and the academics, growing out of different strategies, and the activists' claim that the academics didn't do enough to acknowledge their power and class privilege, and to share more of that with the activists. A professor from the University of Texas adds to this account, reviewing a book called \"Gay Shame\":\n\nThere have also been annual themed events titled \"Gay Shame and Lesbian Weakness\" in London, England associated with the club night Duckie run by Simon Casson and Amy Lame. Although documentation about when the first event happened is hard to come by, the event was occurring annually by 1998, if not earlier. The 2004 event was billed as \"Now in its 9th great year.\" The event includes performance art and queer-bash make-overs and is also referred to as \"The Annual Festival of Homosexual Misery\". The 2009 event has been announced as the last. But, since Gay Shame SF has re-emerged, new events are likely to happen as well.\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, there were Shame events in Stockholm, Sweden. Gay Shame SF meets every Saturday at the Muddy Waters cafe.\n"}

With the former, which he represented in two different spells, he was always crowned Première Division champion.\n\nIn 1967, 20-year-old Keita left for France to join AS Saint-Étienne, where he won three consecutive Ligue 1 titles, including the double in 1968 and 1970. In his last two seasons with \"Les Verts\" combined, he scored an astonishing 71 league goals – 42 alone in the 1970–71 campaign – but the team failed to win any silverware; in 1970, he was voted African Footballer of the Year.\n\nKeita joined fellow league side Olympique de Marseille in the 1972 summer. After the club tried to force him to assume French nationality he opposed, leaving in the ensuing off-season for Valencia CF in Spain.\n\nSpanish newspapers were accused of racism when one headline read \"El Valencia va a por alemanes y vuelve con un negro\" (\"Valencia goes out to buy Germans and comes back with a black man\"), but he was always loved during his spell at the club, netting in his debut with the \"Che\", a 2–1 La Liga home win against Real Oviedo, and being eventually nicknamed \"La perla negra de Malí\" (The black pearl of Mali); he complained, however, that he was constantly played out of position.\n\nIn 1976, after three years with Valencia, Keita signed for Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he replaced another legendary goalscorer, Héctor Yazalde. In two of his three seasons with the Lisbon side he scored in double digits, winning one domestic cup. He retired at the age of 34, after a couple of years with the New England Tea Men in the United States.\n\nIn 1963, at the age of only 16, Keita was selected to play for Mali. He was part of the squad that appeared at the 1972 African Cup of Nations in Cameroon, helping the national team finish second.\n\nIn June 2005, Keita was elected president of the Malian Football Federation for a period of four years. Late into the following year, he was selected by the Confederation of African Football as one of the best 200 African football players of the last 50 years.\n\nKeita's nephew, Seydou Keita, was also a footballer. He also played some years in France, and later represented, with great team and individual success, FC Barcelona. Mohamed Sissoko, who played namely for Valencia, Liverpool and Juventus FC, was also his nephew; both played similar roles as central midfielders; another nephew, Sidi Yaya Keita, was also a footballer and a midfielder, who played most of his career in France with RC Lens.\n\nGuinean film director Cheik Doukouré used the life of Keita as a starting point for his 1994 work \"Le Ballon d'or\". In 1994, he created the first training center for professional football players in Mali, which bore his name.\n\nFrom 2007, Keita acted as delegated minister of the Prime Minister of Mali.\n\n\nMali\n\n\n\n"}

The Yo-Yo's recruited Andy Selway (Bladz) (ex- Sugarsnatch) on drums and guitarist Neil Phillips (B-Movie Heroes) to the band.\n\nThe Yo-Yo's recorded their first single, \"Out Of My Mind\", and then joined The Backyard Babies for a UK tour. Another single was then recorded, \"Rumble(d)\". The Yo-Yo's continued to tour the UK and were then signed by the US record label, Sub Pop.\n\nOn the Sub Pop label, the Yo-Yo's released their debut album, \"Uppers & Downers\" on CD and LP in 2000. Despite gaining a cult following as well a favourable coverage from the rock and indie press, they split up due to infighting among members.\n\nNeil Phillips went on to play for Danny Frye & The Devildolls, and also return his concentration to his own B-Movie Heroes whilst Andy Selway went on to KMFDM. Neil Phillips released his debut solo album in July 2012 under the name Jackrabbit Parole. The album, \"It's a Long Way Back to the Drawing Board\", was available on Front Room Records.\n\nIn 2005, the group reformed with a new line-up, that included McCormack and Spencer, along with Rich Jones on guitar. The band recorded a new EP, \"Given Up Giving Up\" and toured the UK supporting 3 Colours Red. The EP was initially due for release on Mighty Atom Records, but was put out on Undergroove records at the last minute.\n\nEx-Wildhearts drummer Stidi originally took up drumming duties for the band, but was later replaced with a thumb. The band finally walked out on McCormack halfway through a tour with AntiProduct. However, McCormack completed the tour in defiance, with support band Any Given Day providing a backing band.\n\nTom Spencer is currently fronting the London-based The Loyalties, which includes Rich Jones, Lee Jones. Rich Jones also plays with Bassknives. McCormack is working on his first solo album in South Shields. Neil Phillips continues to play with B-Movie Heroes.\n\nOn 17 February 2012, the Yo-Yo's reformed for \"one night only\" for a show at Camden Barfly to celebrate Danny McCormack's 40th birthday. Initially only one show was scheduled but due to demand, a second later show was also booked for later in the evening. At the end of each set the band was joined on stage by Chris McCormack, Andy Cairns, Ritch Battersby (first set) and Stidi (second set). In addition Ray McVeigh and Carl Barât appeared for a selection of punk rock songs. The band also performed on the third stage at Download Festival on 9 June 2012.\n\nThe band made a further appearance on 1 June 2013 at Camden Rocks Festival, curated by Chris McCormack at The Barfly. Chris McCormack was originally planned to take Rich Jones's place who was in the United States with the Ginger Wildheart Band, but Nick Hughes ended up taking second guitar duties, while Si Maxwell performed again with the band on drums.\n\nThe Yoyos were confirmed for two dates in July 2013 at Camden Barfly, warming up to playing the satellite stage at Sonisphere Festival.\n\n"}

The original award was the result of a friendly competition of National Weather Service offices in Upstate. It was originally conceived after the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977. After the Rochester and Syracuse offices closed in the mid-1990s, the competition died out.\n\nThe award was revived during the 2002–2003 snowfall season, in which Syracuse won. It had won every year from then through the 2010–2011 season as well. In the 2011–2012 season, Rochester was the first city other than Syracuse to win since the award's revival. The prize is accompanied by a ceremonial $100 check to one of that city's school's hat and mitten drives. They also receive temporary possession of a trophy for the year. The original competition's trophy went missing, prompting its replacement with a new one donated by a trophy shop in Syracuse. The current Golden Snowball trophy resides in Rochester City Hall.\n\nCompared to Syracuse's average snowfall of 123.8 inches, or over 10 feet per year, New York City's annual snow average is a relatively small 2–3 feet per year in the city and about 3–4 feet per year in nearby suburbs. This is due to a number of factors, including lower latitude and oceanic influence keeping much of the precipitation as rain in the winter, combined with distance from the Great Lakes keeping the city well away from the influence of lake-effect snow. For the first time ever, during the 2005–2006 winter season New York City did have more snowfall than Albany, mainly due to the Blizzard of 2006, which was the city's biggest snowfall to date, while Albany was on the extreme northern fringe.\n\nThe cities that compete for the award are:\n\n\nUntil the 2006–2007 season, several smaller cities also competed for a smaller award, that includes a $50 check.

This service is an annual event, the first of which took place in 1943 at St Paul's Cathedral and since has taken place in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe monument was conceived by Bill Bond, founder of the Battle of Britain Historical Society, who was later appointed an MBE for his services to heritage. He was solely responsible for negotiating with the City of Westminster to secure the site of the monument, as well as appointing Donald Insall Associates as architects. He also formed the fundraising committee after raising over £250,000 through an appeal. The budget was £1.74 million which was funded in the main by private donations. Bill Bond appointed Lord Tebbit as chairman of the fundraising committee.\n\nThe monument utilises a panelled granite structure long which was originally designed as a smoke outlet for underground trains when they were powered by steam engines. A walkway was cut obliquely through the middle of the structure, and is lined with panels of high relief sculpture in bronze depicting scenes from the Battle of Britain. The centrepiece is an approximately life sized sculpture of airmen scrambling for their aircraft during the battle. The outside of the monument is lined with bronze plaques listing 2,936 pilots and aircrew from 14 countries who took part in the battle on the Allied side.\n\nThe sculptor of the monument is Paul Day.

{"id": "2299426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299426", "title": "Getty Square", "text": "Getty Square\n\nGetty Square is the name for downtown Yonkers, New York, centered on the eponymous public square. Getty Square is the civic center, central business district, and transit hub of the City of Yonkers. A dense and growing residential area, it is located in southern Westchester County, New York. The square is named after prominent 19th-century merchant Robert Getty.\n\nThe square is named for Robert Parkhill Getty, a prominent merchant and civic leader in the 1800s. The area was the heart of a Dutch patroonship granted to the first lawyer in the New World, Adriaen van der Donck, who built both saw and grist mills on what was then the \"Saeck Kill\", later to become the \"Nepperhan River\" and today's Saw Mill. \n\nGetty Square's two oldest, still-standing buildings, Philipse Manor Hall (circa 1682) and St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church (built 1752 by Frederick Philipse III), were built in close proximity to the river. The Hudson River, bordering the western waterfront of Getty Square, provided a transportation route to markets beginning in the 1600s. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 increased water-borne traffic from upstate New York down the Hudson to Manhattan.\n\nIn 1853, Elisha Graves Otis, inventor of the safety elevator, established the Otis Elevator Company on the Hudson River and Vark Street, along the new railroad tracks that ran along the Hudson's banks. As the company grew, a larger facility was built just north of the Saw Mill River, what is now Van der Donck Park. Vast Otis factory buildings covering blocks of land extended north to Ashburton Avenue.\n\nLater, three separate railroad companies established lines through Getty Square. The New York and Putnam Railroad built the terminal for its Yonkers Branch line in Getty Square, with the original 1880s headhouse and train shed station in the square later upgraded to an office building and railway platform at 20 South Broadway. (The office building remains, but the railway platform has been replaced by a parking garage.) The New York Central Railroad operated out of the still-in-use Yonkers train station. The Third Avenue Railway trolley company ran multiple streetcar lines through Getty Square, and stored its streetcars (also called trams) in the still-standing Yonkers Trolley Barn on Main Street in Getty Square.\n\nLike many downtowns in the northeastern United States, Getty Square suffered gradual and severe de-industrialization and non-automobile infrastructure disinvestment beginning after World War II. The Otis Elevator Company factory, with vast buildings covering much of the Getty Square neighborhood north of what is now Van der Donck Park, closed in 1983. Rail-based transportation also diminished. The closing and quick demolition of the Yonkers Branch of the New York and Putnam Railroad, despite an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, occurred in 1944, and the Third Avenue Railway trolley service finally ended in 1952. The Saw Mill River, once the economic engine of Getty Square, was buried in flumes underground in the 1920s; the pavement above was used mostly for car parking lots at Chicken Island, Mill Street Courtyard, and Larkin Plaza. New York State widened Nepperhan Avenue to create an arterial highway along the eastern side of the neighborhood, demolishing a Carnegie library in the process.\n\nThe farmers' market at St. John's Church is the oldest in Westchester.\n\nThe reconstituting of the vacant Otis Elevator Factory campus into the iPark corporate business center spurred an influx of advanced industrial initiatives. Capitalizing on the iPark location connected to the existing rail network, Kawasaki Heavy Industries brought its railcar assembly plant to Getty Square. In 2011, iPark installed the largest solar-panel array in Westchester on its roof to provide low-cost electricity to its manufacturing tenants. In 2011, ContraFect, a biotechnology firm, relocated from Manhattan to Getty Square's iPark, followed in 2013 by Mindspark Interactive Network. Also in 2013, the YONY initiative to spur increased technology company activity began.\n\nIn 2007, the Science Barge, an solar- and wind-powered demonstration farm, using hydroponics and aquaculture, docked at its permanent home next to the train station at the mouth of the Saw Mill River. The Science Barge draws thousands of researchers and students in the STEM fields, environmental science, and agriculture to Getty Square from around the world, and has been featured by the news media as far as Brazil, Japan and South Korea. In 2013, Sarah Lawrence College established an academic research center at the existing Beczak Environmental Center.\n\nThe Saw Mill River, the catalyst for Yonkers' initial economic growth in the 17th century, is again being used as an economic engine. Long buried underground in Getty Square, in 2012, the City of Yonkers and Groundwork Yonkers completed the \"daylighting\" of the Saw Mill River and construction of Van der Donck Park around it just east of the Yonkers train station. The park, featuring public amenities and wildlife elements, has become an international showpiece.\n\nVan der Donck Park was the first phase of daylighting the river in Getty Square. The second phase, the Mill Street Courtyard project to be constructed in 2014, will daylight another portion of the river in a Getty Square block bounded by Warburton Avenue (west), North Broadway (east), Manor House Lane (north), and Main Street (south). The third daylighting phase, near Chicken Island, does not yet have a start date, although New York State awarded a $1.08 million grant for the project at the end of 2013.\n\nGetty Square is a bustling, multi-ethnic shopping district with very high numbers of shoppers compared with other Westchester downtowns (See Intermodal Transit Hub section below.) With significant cohorts of along with many ethnic groups, businesses benefit from an international customer base, including African-American and Latino customers.\n\nFarmers' markets and the CSA operate seasonally: St. John's Episcopal Church holds its market on Thursdays at the church; and Groundwork holds its market on Fridays in Van der Donck Park, across the street from the Yonkers train station. The St. John's Church's market is the oldest farmers market in Westchester. The CSA is operated by Groundwork. At all the markets and the CSA, produce can be purchased using government assistance programs.\n\nRetail and business banking thrives in Getty Square. Branches of all the major national banks are present, including: Chase with two branches, Wells Fargo, Citibank, HSBC, and Bank of America. Branches of regional banks and credit unions include: Atlantic Bank & Trust, Hudson Valley Bank, KeyBank, and Municipal Credit Union.\n\nKawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company is located in the Central Business District.\n\nGetty Square's heavy pedestrian foot traffic is bolstered by its role as a key transit hub of Yonkers and Westchester. Bee-Line buses, MTA express buses, Metro-North Railroad, and Amtrak converge in Getty Square, and connections are often little more than a few blocks.\n\nGetty Square achieves a Walk Score of 95 out of 100, making it a \"Walker's Paradise\" where \"daily errands do not require a car.\" Getty Square's WalkScore is the highest of any neighborhood in Westchester, making it one of the best places in the County to be car-free.\n\nThe combination of walkability and a transit hub has spurred transit-oriented development, with zoning changes to promote less car travel and more walking, cycling, and transit use.\n\n Many of the bus routes provide direct connections to the New York City Subway.\nBee-Line Bus and MTA Express Bus serve Getty Square. Ridership on buses dwarfs that of commuter rail. Annual bus ridership on lines in Getty Square numbers in the millions, with Yonkers being the largest origin and destination for bus trips in the Bee-Line Bus service area of Westchester and the northern Bronx. In addition to the thru-running buses, loop route bus lines circulate through Getty Square and adjoining neighborhoods. The MTA Express Bus lines provide direct transportation to midtown Manhattan. Metro Card and exact change are accepted on buses serving Getty Square.\n\nBus routes in Getty Square may be expanded in the future. As part of the transit plan for the Tappan Zee Bridge Replacement, a proposed express bus route from Spring Valley in Rockland County would have Getty Square as its final destination.\n\nMetro-North Railroad serves Getty Square. Rail riders use Getty Square's Beaux-Arts Yonkers station to board Hudson Line and Amtrak trains. Metro-North provides trips south to stations in the Bronx and to Harlem–125th Street, and Grand Central Terminal, and to the north to stations along the Hudson Line as far as Poughkeepsie.\n\nMany Metro North commuters connect to the New York City Subway at Marble Hill to Marble Hill – 225th Street ( train)\nto reach destinations on the west side of Manhattan, and Harlem–125th Street to 125th Street () for Manhattan's east side.\n\nAmtrak serves Getty Square. The Yonkers train station is the sole southern Westchester station on the Amtrak Hudson River Line, providing an Inter-city rail link to US and Canadian cities like Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Montreal, and Toronto.\n\nTaxi stands sit at the heart of Getty Square along New Main Street, and at the Yonkers Train Station. Taxis are often used by shoppers with large packages.\nCar sharing Zipcars are available near the Yonkers Train Station since 2012.\n\nFerry service ended in 2010 between Yonkers and other points in New York City and the Hudson Valley. Boat docking is permitted at the Yonkers Pier.\n\nBicycles are used frequently in Getty Square, mostly for transportation as opposed to recreation. Many businesses use them for fast local deliveries. Children use them to get around. Warburton Avenue and Riverdale Avenue, which meet in Getty Square, are well-used, Westchester bicycling commuting routes.\n\nLimeBike dockless bikeshare began operations in Yonkers in May 2018.\n\nWalking and bicycling trails in Getty Square are still on the drawing board. The Old Croton Aqueduct runs along the northern edge of the Getty Square neighborhood, although two blocks of path are on-street at Ashburton Avenue. The Hudson River Valley Greenway, not yet built in Yonkers, may combine portions of the Hudson River waterfront promenade with the Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway. A concept to turn the former Getty Square branch of the New York and Putnam Railroad into a trail has been proposed. It would connect Getty Square and the waterfront promenade at the Science Barge with Van Cortlandt Park. It would be an urban multi-use path with both on- and off-street portions.\n\nRestaurateur Peter X. Kelly grew up near Getty Square, and opened Xaviar's on the Hudson, on the 2nd floor of the Yonkers Pier in 2007.\n"}

He is reported to have taught himself how to play guitar. He fronted other bands, including Moxy, before helping form Loverboy. Reno also sang for the Canadian band Hammersmith in 1976.\n\nWhile still in school in the early 1970s, Reno joined a cover band called Morning Glory, in which he played the drums and eventually found his way to the cover band Synergy. Later, Reno moved on to a band called Spunk with guitarist Jack Stoltz. After graduating from Penticton Secondary School, Reno moved to Calgary, Alberta, after which he briefly joined the band Moxy for a single album, \"Under the Lights\", released in 1978. It was something of a departure from the previous Moxy albums, partially because of changes in band members as well as Reno's different singing style, and did not sell as well as the band's earlier releases. Eventually, Reno was introduced to Paul Dean in 1979 at a nightclub called The Refinery and they immediately got together for a jam session, which led to the formation of Loverboy shortly thereafter. Loverboy released its first album in 1980 and the band went on to tour extensively as well as release three more multi-platinum albums between 1981 and 1985. Loverboy's last full album of original material in the 1980s was \"Wildside\" (1987), though they included three new original songs on the compilation album \"Big Ones\" (1989).\n\nReno has also contributed to various film soundtracks. In 1984, he performed a duet with Ann Wilson of Heart, \"Almost Paradise\", for the movie \"Footloose\". With Loverboy, the band contributed \"Heaven in Your Eyes\" for the movie \"Top Gun\" (1986). Reno contributed the song \"Chasing the Angels\" for the soundtrack to \"Iron Eagle II\" (1988) along with the song \"Whenever There's a Night\" for the movie \"Dream a Little Dream\" (1989). Reno also reportedly recorded a cover of \"Never Been to Spain\", a song that was originally written by Hoyt Axton and previously recorded by the band Three Dog Night for their album \"Harmony\" (1971). The Three Dog Night version went to #1 on the charts. In 1990 Reno co-wrote and performed the song 'All I Ever Needed' From David Foster Album \"River of Love\". In a 2003 release, artist Tim Feehan released a solo album \"Tracks I Forgot About\" containing a song that features Reno on vocals, \"Call of the Wild\".\n\nReno's son, Alex, was born on January 23, 1988.\n\nIn the late 1990s, during a VH1 interview, Reno attributed the decline of Loverboy to the rise of grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Nirvana.\n\nIn 2002, Reno released his first solo album titled \"Renovation\". The album is composed of ten tracks closely resembling the sound of his work with Loverboy though some discs contain a bonus track titled \"Guilty as Charged.\" The album was reportedly recorded 1992 and was supposed to be released by Sony but they chose instead to indefinitely shelve the project due to changes in the music industry... the changes touched on by Reno in his previously mentioned VH1 interview. Reno eventually proceeded to release the un-mastered recordings from his own archival tapes on his now defunct website but went on to release the album widely on a variety of sources. The main complaint amongst critics and fans is a lack of mastering, overall production and polishing commonly found on finished albums... but hard core fans and critics seem to feel the album is more than worthy of attention in spite of this.\n\nLoverboy had a headlining spot at the 2007 Grey Cup party in Toronto. At the 2009 Juno Awards, Reno was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of Loverboy. Loverboy also played as a part of the 2010 Olympic ceremonies in Vancouver on Sunday February 21, 2010. This night, otherwise known as \"Nunavut night\", was co-headlined with the band Trooper. The live medal presentations were in short track speed skating (ladies' 1,500 m and men's 1,000 m), men's 1,500-metre speed skating and men's freestyle skiing ski cross.\n\nAs of 2015, Reno continues to tour and play live shows with Loverboy (see the band's official website for currently scheduled concert dates) and has dates already scheduled for 2015. The band's latest full album of all-new material that contains new songs is \"Unfinished Business\". The album was released on July 15, 2014 through Loverboy Music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other common names used for the European fire-bellied toad include ringing frog, fiery toad, fire frog, and firebelly toad.\n\nEuropean fire-bellied toads have a bright lime green dorsal traversed by black spots, and orange to bright red bellies with black bars and stripes. The skin is mildly bumpy, the eyes set high to suit a semi-aquatic life style, and also well webbed back feet. Color and body variations will be described for each of the other 3 species commonly sold as or mistaken for Oriental fire-bellied toads. They are the largest of the bombina family. They are commonly darker than Fire-bellied toads from Asia.\n\nThe European fire-bellied toad is 26–60 mm long and may weigh 2-13.9 g. The body is depressed. Above, the skin is densely covered in low tubercles with black horny spines. There are no parotids behind the eyes but paired and arched gland complexes at the neck. The eardrums are not visible. Inner vocal sacs are present at the throat and webbings are well developed at the hind feet. The pupils are heart-shaped. The body colour is grey, brown or green with dark spots on the upper side and blackish with larger orange or red and smaller white spots on the underside. The skin produces a poison to protect itself from bacteria and fungi or the animal from vertebrates. This poison is irritating to mucous membranes. The eggs are brown above and lighter below. They are 1.4-1.8 mm large coated with a transparent jelly of 5–8 mm in diameter. Tadpoles may reach a length of 55 mm and are brownish above with two longitudinal pale bands along the backbone. The mouth field is triangular and the flipper is reticulated.\n\nWhen they shed their skin, they bloat themselves and make a coughing sound, then start to tear the old skin off with their mouth, and eat it for nutrition, to reveal newer, brighter skin.\n\nThe food of the European fire-bellied toad consists of insects, spiders, millipedes, mollusks and earthworms captured in or nearby the water. The tadpoles mainly feed on algae, bacteria and plankton by grazing the surfaces of stones and plants. If attacked by a vertebrate on land the European fire-bellied toad makes a hollow-back and lifts its four legs so that the ventral warning colour is displayed. The combination of dark and red is a learned signal meaning “attention poison” to the enemy.\n\nReproduction takes place from April to July/August and is induced by heavy rainfall. Then, males can be recognized by some darkened, spiny swelling, the nuptial pad, on their forelegs. They help it to grasp the female properly around its hip. Males defend small territories of 2–3 m in diameter against rivals. Spawn consists of small clutches of 10–40 eggs which are attached to plants. Several such clutches are produced in a short time and thereby a female may lay a total of 80–300 eggs. Tadpoles hatch after 2–5 days and metamorphose after 5–12 weeks from July to September or after hibernation in spring. Young toads are 11–15 mm long and remain at the water's edge. Maturity is reached at an age of 1–2 years. The European fire-bellied toad may live more than 10 years. The rather loud melodic call is repeated about 10–50 times per minute, correlating with temperature, and is performed in the afternoon at temperatures of 12–34 °C while drifting at the water surface. The sound is produced when the air is pressed from the vocal sac back to the lungs which is the opposite to what “higher” frogs do. It hibernates on land in frost-resisting dens like hollows under stones or dead wood.\n"}
{"id": "2299454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299454", "title": "Lorentz ether theory", "text": "Lorentz ether theory\n\nWhat is now often called Lorentz ether theory (LET) has its roots in Hendrik Lorentz's \"theory of electrons\", which was the final point in the development of the classical aether theories at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nLorentz's initial theory was created between 1892 and 1895 and was based on a completely motionless aether. It explained the failure of the negative aether drift experiments to first order in \"v\"/\"c\" by introducing an auxiliary variable called \"local time\" for connecting systems at rest and in motion in the aether. In addition, the negative result of the Michelson–Morley experiment led to the introduction of the hypothesis of length contraction in 1892. However, other experiments also produced negative results and (guided by Henri Poincaré's principle of relativity) Lorentz tried in 1899 and 1904 to expand his theory to all orders in \"v\"/\"c\" by introducing the Lorentz transformation. In addition, he assumed that also non-electromagnetic forces (if they exist) transform like electric forces. However, Lorentz's expression for charge density and current were incorrect, so his theory did not fully exclude the possibility of detecting the aether. Eventually, it was Henri Poincaré who in 1905 corrected the errors in Lorentz's paper and actually incorporated non-electromagnetic forces (including gravitation) within the theory, which he called \"The New Mechanics\". Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into special relativity (SR) with the works of Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski.\n\nToday LET is often treated as some sort of \"Lorentzian\" or \"neo-Lorentzian\" interpretation of special relativity. The introduction of length contraction and time dilation for all phenomena in a \"preferred\" frame of reference, which plays the role of Lorentz's immobile aether, leads to the complete Lorentz transformation (see the Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory as an example). Because the same mathematical formalism occurs in both, it is not possible to distinguish between LET and SR by experiment. However, in LET the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the validity of the relativity principle seems to be only coincidental, which is one reason why SR is commonly preferred over LET.\n\nThis theory, which was developed mainly between 1892 and 1906 by Lorentz and Poincaré, was based on the aether theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, Maxwell's equations and the electron theory of Rudolf Clausius. Lorentz introduced a strict separation between matter (electrons) and aether, whereby in his model the aether is completely motionless, and it won't be set in motion in the neighborhood of ponderable matter. As Max Born later said, it was natural (though not logically necessary) for scientists of that time to identify the rest frame of the Lorentz aether with the absolute space of Isaac Newton. The condition of this aether can be described by the electric field E and the magnetic field H, where these fields represent the \"states\" of the aether (with no further specification), related to the charges of the electrons. Thus an abstract electromagnetic aether replaces the older mechanistic aether models. Contrary to Clausius, who accepted that the electrons operate by actions at a distance, the electromagnetic field of the aether appears as a mediator between the electrons, and changes in this field can propagate not faster than the speed of light. Lorentz theoretically explained the Zeeman effect on the basis of his theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. Joseph Larmor found a similar theory simultaneously, but his concept was based on a mechanical aether. A fundamental concept of Lorentz's theory in 1895 was the \"theorem of corresponding states\" for terms of order \"v\"/\"c\". This theorem states that a moving observer with respect to the aether can use the same electrodynamic equations as an observer in the stationary aether system, thus they are making the same observations.\n\nA big challenge for this theory was the Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887. According to the theories of Fresnel and Lorentz a relative motion to an immobile aether had to be determined by this experiment; however, the result was negative. Michelson himself thought that the result confirmed the aether drag hypothesis, in which the aether is fully dragged by matter. However, other experiments like the Fizeau experiment and the effect of aberration disproved that model.\n\nA possible solution came in sight, when in 1889 Oliver Heaviside derived from Maxwell's equations that the magnetic vector potential field around a moving body is altered by a factor of formula_1. Based on that result, and to bring the hypothesis of an immobile aether into accordance with the Michelson–Morley experiment, George FitzGerald in 1889 (qualitatively) and, independently of him, Lorentz in 1892 (already quantitatively), suggested that not only the electrostatic fields, but also the molecular forces, are affected in such a way that the dimension of a body in the line of motion is less by the value formula_2 than the dimension perpendicularly to the line of motion. However, an observer co-moving with the earth would not notice this contraction because all other instruments contract at the same ratio. In 1895 Lorentz proposed three possible explanations for this relative contraction:\n\nAlthough the possible connection between electrostatic and intermolecular forces was used by Lorentz as a plausibility argument, the contraction hypothesis was soon considered as purely ad hoc. It is also important that this contraction would only affect the space between the electrons but not the electrons themselves; therefore the name \"intermolecular hypothesis\" was sometimes used for this effect. The so-called Length contraction without expansion perpendicularly to the line of motion and by the precise value formula_3 (where l is the length at rest in the aether) was given by Larmor in 1897 and by Lorentz in 1904. In the same year, Lorentz also argued that electrons themselves are also affected by this contraction. For further development of this concept, see the section #Lorentz transformation.\n\nAn important part of the theorem of corresponding states in 1892 and 1895 was the local time formula_4, where \"t\" is the time coordinate for an observer resting in the aether, and \"t\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> is the time coordinate for an observer moving in the aether. (Woldemar Voigt had previously used the same expression for local time in 1887 in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium.) With the help of this concept Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment (i.e. measurements of the Fresnel drag coefficient) by Hippolyte Fizeau in moving and also resting liquids. While for Lorentz length contraction was a real physical effect, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation to simplify the calculation from the resting to a \"fictitious\" moving system. Contrary to Lorentz, Poincaré saw more than a mathematical trick in the definition of local time, which he called Lorentz's \"most ingenious idea\". In he wrote in 1898:\n\nIn 1900 Poincaré interpreted local time as the result of a synchronization procedure based on light signals. He assumed that two observers, \"A\" and \"B\", who are moving in the aether, synchronize their clocks by optical signals. Since they treat themselves as being at rest, they must consider only the transmission time of the signals and then crossing their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous. However, from the point of view of an observer at rest in the aether the clocks are not synchronous and indicate the local time formula_4. But because the moving observers don't know anything about their movement, they don't recognize this. In 1904, he illustrated the same procedure in the following way: \"A\" sends a signal at time 0 to \"B\", which arrives at time \"t\". B also sends a signal at time 0 to \"A\", which arrives at time \"t\". If in both cases \"t\" has the same value, the clocks are synchronous, but only in the system in which the clocks are at rest in the aether. So, according to Darrigol, Poincaré understood local time as a physical effect just like length contraction – in contrast to Lorentz, who used the same interpretation not before 1906. However, contrary to Einstein, who later used a similar synchronization procedure which was called Einstein synchronisation, Darrigol says that Poincaré had the opinion that clocks resting in the aether are showing the true time.\n\nHowever, at the beginning it was unknown that local time includes what is now known as time dilation. This effect was first noticed by Larmor (1897), who wrote that \"\"individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [aether] system in the ratio formula_6 or formula_7\"\". And in 1899 also Lorentz noted for the frequency of oscillating electrons \"\"that in S the time of vibrations be formula_8 times as great as in S\"\", where S is the aether frame, S the mathematical-fictitious frame of the moving observer, k is formula_1, and formula_10 is an undetermined factor. \n\nWhile \"local time\" could explain the negative aether drift experiments to first order to \"v\"/\"c\", it was necessary – due to other unsuccessful aether drift experiments like the Trouton–Noble experiment – to modify the hypothesis to include second-order effects. The mathematical tool for that is the so-called Lorentz transformation. Voigt in 1887 had already derived a similar set of equations (although with a different scale factor). Afterwards, Larmor in 1897 and Lorentz in 1899 derived equations in a form algebraically equivalent to those which are used up to this day, although Lorentz used an undetermined factor \"l\" in his transformation. In his paper (1904) Lorentz attempted to create such a theory, according to which \"all\" forces between the molecules are affected by the Lorentz transformation (in which Lorentz set the factor \"l\" to unity) in the same manner as electrostatic forces. In other words, Lorentz attempted to create a theory in which the relative motion of earth and aether is (nearly or fully) undetectable. Therefore, he generalized the contraction hypothesis and argued that not only the forces between the electrons, but also the electrons themselves are contracted in the line of motion. However, Max Abraham (1904) quickly noted a defect of that theory: Within a purely electromagnetic theory the contracted electron-configuration is unstable and one has to introduce non-electromagnetic force to stabilize the electrons – Abraham himself questioned the possibility of including such forces within the theory of Lorentz.\n\nSo it was Poincaré who, on 5 June 1905, who introduced the so-called \"Poincaré stresses\" to solve that problem. Those stresses were interpreted by him as an external, non-electromagnetic pressure, which stabilize the electrons and also served as an explanation for length contraction. Although he argued that Lorentz succeeded in creating a theory which complies to the postulate of relativity, he showed that Lorentz's equations of electrodynamics were not fully Lorentz covariant. So by pointing out the group characteristics of the transformation, Poincaré demonstrated the Lorentz covariance of the Maxwell–Lorentz equations and corrected Lorentz's transformation formulae for charge density and current density. He went on to sketch a model of gravitation (incl. gravitational waves) which might be compatible with the transformations. It was Poincaré who, for the first time, used the term \"Lorentz transformation\", and he gave them a form which is used up to this day. (Where formula_11 is an arbitrary function of formula_10, which must be set to unity to conserve the group characteristics. He also set the speed of light to unity.)\n\nA substantially extended work (the so-called \"Palermo paper\") was submitted by Poincaré on 23 July 1905, but was published in January 1906 because the journal appeared only twice a year. He spoke literally of \"the postulate of relativity\", he showed that the transformations are a consequence of the principle of least action; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination formula_15 is invariant. While elaborating his gravitational theory, he noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing formula_16 as a fourth, imaginary, coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. However, Poincaré later said the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit, and therefore he refused to work out the consequences of this notion. This was later done, however, by Minkowski; see \"The shift to relativity\".\n\nJ. J. Thomson (1881) and others noticed, that electromagnetic energy contributes to the mass of charged bodies by the amount formula_17, which was called electromagnetic or \"apparent mass\". Another derivation of some sort of electromagnetic mass was conducted by Poincaré (1900). By using the momentum of electromagnetic fields, he concluded that these fields contribute a mass of formula_18 to all bodies, which is necessary to save the center of mass theorem.\n\nAs noted by Thomson and others, this mass increases also with velocity. Thus in 1899, Lorentz calculated that the ratio of the electron's mass in the moving frame and that of the aether frame is formula_19 parallel to the direction of motion, and formula_8 perpendicular to the direction of motion, where formula_21 and formula_10 is an undetermined factor. And in 1904, he set formula_23, arriving at the expressions for the masses in different directions (longitudinal and transverse):\n\nwhere\n\nMany scientists now believed that the entire mass and all forms of forces were electromagnetic in nature. This idea had to be given up, however, in the course of the development of relativistic mechanics. Abraham (1904) argued (as described in the preceding section #Lorentz transformation), that non-electrical binding forces were necessary within Lorentz's electrons model. But Abraham also noted that different results occurred, dependent on whether the em-mass is calculated from the energy or from the momentum. To solve those problems, Poincaré in 1905 and 1906 introduced some sort of pressure of non-electrical nature, which contributes the amount formula_26 to the energy of the bodies, and therefore explains the 4/3-factor in the expression for the electromagnetic mass-energy relation. However, while Poincaré's expression for the energy of the electrons was correct, he erroneously stated that only the em-energy contributes to the mass of the bodies.\n\nThe concept of electromagnetic mass is not considered anymore as the cause of mass \"per se\", because the entire mass (not only the electromagnetic part) is proportional to energy, and can be \"converted\" into different forms of energy, which is explained by Einstein's mass–energy equivalence.\n\nIn 1900 Lorentz tried to explain gravity on the basis of the Maxwell equations. He first considered a Le Sage type model and argued that there possibly exists a universal radiation field, consisting of very penetrating em-radiation, and exerting a uniform pressure on every body. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption must lead to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model.\n\nIn the same paper, he assumed like Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti and Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. This leads to a conflict with the law of gravitation by Isaac Newton, in which it was shown by Pierre Simon Laplace that a finite speed of gravity leads to some sort of aberration and therefore makes the orbits unstable. However, Lorentz showed that the theory is not concerned by Laplace's critique, because due to the structure of the Maxwell equations only effects in the order \"v\"/\"c\" arise. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low. He wrote:\n\nIn 1908 Poincaré examined the gravitational theory of Lorentz and classified it as compatible with the relativity principle, but (like Lorentz) he criticized the inaccurate indication of the perihelion advance of Mercury. Contrary to Poincaré, Lorentz in 1914 considered his own theory as incompatible with the relativity principle and rejected it.\n\nPoincaré argued in 1904 that a propagation speed of gravity which is greater than c is contradicting the concept of local time and the relativity principle. He wrote: \n\nHowever, in 1905 and 1906 Poincaré pointed out the possibility of a gravitational theory, in which changes propagate with the speed of light and which is Lorentz covariant. He pointed out that in such a theory the gravitational force not only depends on the masses and their mutual distance, but also on their velocities and their position due to the finite propagation time of interaction. On that occasion Poincaré introduced four-vectors. Following Poincaré, also Minkowski (1908) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) tried to establish a Lorentz-invariant gravitational law. However, these attempts were superseded because of Einstein's theory of general relativity, see \"The shift to relativity\".\n\nAlready in his philosophical writing on time measurements (1898), Poincaré wrote that astronomers like Ole Rømer, in determining the speed of light, simply assume that light has a constant speed, and that this speed is the same in all directions. Without this postulate it would not be possible to infer the speed of light from astronomical observations, as Rømer did based on observations of the moons of Jupiter. Poincaré went on to note that Rømer also had to assume that Jupiter's moons obey Newton's laws, including the law of gravitation, whereas it would be possible to reconcile a different speed of light with the same observations if we assumed some different (probably more complicated) laws of motion. According to Poincaré, this illustrates that we adopt for the speed of light a value that makes the laws of mechanics as simple as possible. (This is an example of Poincaré's conventionalist philosophy.) Poincaré also noted that the propagation speed of light can be (and in practice often is) used to define simultaneity between spatially separate events. However, in that paper he did not go on to discuss the consequences of applying these \"conventions\" to multiple relatively moving systems of reference. This next step was done by Poincaré in 1900, when he recognized that synchronization by light signals in earth's reference frame leads to Lorentz's local time. (See the section on \"local time\" above). And in 1904 Poincaré wrote:\n\nIn 1895 Poincaré argued that experiments like that of Michelson–Morley show that it seems to be impossible to detect the absolute motion of matter or the relative motion of matter in relation to the aether. And although most physicists had other views, Poincaré in 1900 stood to his opinion and alternately used the expressions \"principle of relative motion\" and \"relativity of space\". He criticized Lorentz by saying, that it would be better to create a more fundamental theory, which explains the absence of any aether drift, than to create one hypothesis after the other. In 1902 he used for the first time the expression \"principle of relativity\". In 1904 he appreciated the work of the mathematicians, who saved what he now called the \"principle of relativity\" with the help of hypotheses like local time, but he confessed that this venture was possible only by an accumulation of hypotheses. And he defined the principle in this way (according to Miller based on Lorentz's theorem of corresponding states): \"\"The principle of relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion.\"\"\n\nReferring to the critique of Poincaré from 1900, Lorentz wrote in his famous paper in 1904, where he extended his theorem of corresponding states: \"\"Surely, the course of inventing special hypotheses for each new experimental result is somewhat artificial. It would be more satisfactory, if it were possible to show, by means of certain fundamental assumptions, and without neglecting terms of one order of magnitude or another, that many electromagnetic actions are entirely independent of the motion of the system.\"\"\n\nOne of the first assessments of Lorentz's paper was by Paul Langevin in May 1905. According to him, this extension of the electron theories of Lorentz and Larmor led to \"the physical impossibility to demonstrate the translational motion of the earth\". However, Poincaré noticed in 1905 that Lorentz's theory of 1904 was not perfectly \"Lorentz invariant\" in a few equations such as Lorentz's expression for current density (Lorentz admitted in 1921 that these were defects). As this required just minor modifications of Lorentz's work, also Poincaré asserted that Lorentz had succeeded in harmonizing his theory with the principle of relativity: \"\"It appears that this impossibility of demonstrating the absolute motion of the earth is a general law of nature. [...] Lorentz tried to complete and modify his hypothesis in order to harmonize it with the postulate of \"complete\" impossibility of determining absolute motion. It is what he has succeeded in doing in his article entitled \"Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light\" [Lorentz, 1904b].\"\"\n\nIn his Palermo paper (1906), Poincaré called this \"the postulate of relativity“, and although he stated that it was possible this principle might be disproved at some point (and in fact he mentioned at the paper's end that the discovery of magneto-cathode rays by Paul Ulrich Villard (1904) seems to threaten it), he believed it was interesting to consider the consequences if we were to assume the postulate of relativity was valid without restriction. This would imply that all forces of nature (not just electromagnetism) must be invariant under the Lorentz transformation. In 1921 Lorentz credited Poincaré for establishing the principle and postulate of relativity and wrote: \"\"I have not established the principle of relativity as rigorously and universally true. Poincaré, on the other hand, has obtained a perfect invariance of the electro-magnetic equations, and he has formulated 'the postulate of relativity', terms which he was the first to employ.\"\"\n\nPoincaré wrote in the sense of his conventionalist philosophy in 1889: \"\"Whether the aether exists or not matters little – let us leave that to the metaphysicians; what is essential for us is, that everything happens as if it existed, and that this hypothesis is found to be suitable for the explanation of phenomena. After all, have we any other reason for believing in the existence of material objects? That, too, is only a convenient hypothesis; only, it will never cease to be so, while some day, no doubt, the aether will be thrown aside as useless.\"\"\n\nHe also denied the existence of absolute space and time by saying in 1901: \"\"1. There is no absolute space, and we only conceive of relative motion ; and yet in most cases mechanical facts are enunciated as if there is an absolute space to which they can be referred. 2. There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, but we have not even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places. I have explained this in an article entitled \"Mesure du Temps\" [1898]. 4. Finally, is not our Euclidean geometry in itself only a kind of convention of language?\"\"\n\nHowever, Poincaré himself never abandoned the aether hypothesis and stated in 1900: \"\"Does our aether actually exist ? We know the origin of our belief in the aether. If light takes several years to reach us from a distant star, it is no longer on the star, nor is it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported, so to speak, by some material agency.\"\" And referring to the Fizeau experiment, he even wrote: \"\"The aether is all but in our grasp.\"\" He also said the aether is necessary to harmonize Lorentz's theory with Newton's third law. Even in 1912 in a paper called \"The Quantum Theory\", Poincaré ten times used the word \"aether\", and described light as \"\"luminous vibrations of the aether\"\".\n\nAnd although he admitted the relative and conventional character of space and time, he believed that the classical convention is more \"convenient\" and continued to distinguish between \"true\" time in the aether and \"apparent\" time in moving systems. Addressing the question if a new convention of space and time is needed he wrote in 1912: \"\"Shall we be obliged to modify our conclusions? Certainly not; we had adopted a convention because it seemed convenient and we had said that nothing could constrain us to abandon it. Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all. And those who are not of this opinion can legitimately retain the old one in order not to disturb their old habits, I believe, just between us, that this is what they shall do for a long time to come.\"\"\n\nAlso Lorentz argued during his lifetime that in all frames of reference this one has to be preferred, in which the aether is at rest. Clocks in this frame are showing the \"real“ time and simultaneity is not relative. However, if the correctness of the relativity principle is accepted, it is impossible to find this system by experiment.\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper on what is now called special relativity. In this paper, by examining the fundamental meanings of the space and time coordinates used in physical theories, Einstein showed that the \"effective\" coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. From this followed all of the physically observable consequences of LET, along with others, all without the need to postulate an unobservable entity (the aether). Einstein identified two fundamental principles, each founded on experience, from which all of Lorentz's electrodynamics follows:\n\n1. The laws by which physical processes occur are the same with respect to any system of inertial coordinates (the principle of relativity)<br>\n2. In empty space light propagates at an absolute speed c in any system of inertial coordinates (the principle of the constancy of light)\n\nTaken together (along with a few other tacit assumptions such as isotropy and homogeneity of space), these two postulates lead uniquely to the mathematics of special relativity. Lorentz and Poincaré had also adopted these same principles, as necessary to achieve their final results, but didn't recognize that they were also \"sufficient\", and hence that they obviated all the other assumptions underlying Lorentz's initial derivations (many of which later turned out to be incorrect ). Therefore, special relativity very quickly gained wide acceptance among physicists, and the 19th century concept of a luminiferous aether was no longer considered useful.\n\nEinstein's 1905 presentation of special relativity was soon supplemented, in 1907, by Hermann Minkowski, who showed that the relations had a very natural interpretation in terms of a unified four-dimensional \"spacetime\" in which absolute intervals are seen to be given by an extension of the Pythagorean theorem. (Already in 1906 Poincaré anticipated some of Minkowski's ideas, see the section \"Lorentz-transformation\"). The utility and naturalness of the representations by Einstein and Minkowski contributed to the rapid acceptance of special relativity, and to the corresponding loss of interest in Lorentz's aether theory.\n\nIn 1909 and 1912 Einstein explained:\n\nIn 1907 Einstein criticized the \"ad hoc\" character of Lorentz's contraction hypothesis in his theory of electrons, because according to him it was an artificial assumption to make the Michelson–Morley experiment conform to Lorentz's stationary aether and the relativity principle. Einstein argued that Lorentz's \"local time\" can simply be called \"time\", and he stated that the immobile aether as the theoretical foundation of electrodynamics was unsatisfactory. He wrote in 1920:\n\nMinkowski argued that Lorentz's introduction of the contraction hypothesis \"sounds rather fantastical\", since it is not the product of resistance in the aether but a \"gift from above\". He said that this hypothesis is \"completely equivalent with the new concept of space and time\", though it becomes much more comprehensible in the framework of the new spacetime geometry. However, Lorentz disagreed that it was \"ad-hoc\" and he argued in 1913 that there is little difference between his theory and the negation of a preferred reference frame, as in the theory of Einstein and Minkowski, so that it is a matter of taste which theory one prefers.\n\nIt was derived by Einstein (1905) as a consequence of the relativity principle, that inertia of energy is actually represented by formula_27, but in contrast to Poincaré's 1900-paper, Einstein recognized that matter itself loses or gains mass during the emission or absorption. So the mass of any form of matter is equal to a certain amount of energy, which can be converted into and re-converted from other forms of energy. This is the mass–energy equivalence, represented by formula_28. So Einstein didn't have to introduce \"fictitious\" masses and also avoided the perpetual motion problem, because according to Darrigol, Poincaré's radiation paradox can simply be solved by applying Einstein's equivalence. If the light source loses mass during the emission by formula_27, the contradiction in the momentum law vanishes without the need of any compensating effect in the aether.\n\nSimilar to Poincaré, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of (electromagnetic) energy is a necessary condition for the center of mass theorem to hold in systems, in which electromagnetic fields and matter are acting on each other. Based on the mass–energy equivalence, he showed that emission and absorption of em-radiation, and therefore the transport of inertia, solves all problems. On that occasion, Einstein referred to Poincaré's 1900-paper and wrote:\n\nAlso Poincaré's rejection of the reaction principle due to the violation of the mass conservation law can be avoided through Einstein's formula_28, because mass conservation appears as a special case of the energy conservation law.\n\nThe attempts of Lorentz and Poincaré (and other attempts like those of Abraham and Gunnar Nordström) to formulate a theory of gravitation were superseded by Einstein's theory of general relativity. This theory is based on principles like the equivalence principle, the general principle of relativity, the principle of general covariance, geodesic motion, local Lorentz covariance (the laws of special relativity apply locally for all inertial observers), and that spacetime curvature is created by stress-energy within the spacetime.\n\nIn 1920, Einstein compared Lorentz's aether with the \"gravitational aether\" of general relativity. He said that immobility is the only mechanical property of which the aether has not been deprived by Lorentz, but, contrary to the luminiferous and Lorentz's aether, the aether of general relativity has no mechanical property, not even immobility:\nSome claim that Poincaré and Lorentz are the true founders of special relativity, not Einstein. For more details see the article on this dispute.\n\nViewed as a theory of elementary particles, Lorentz's electron/ether theory was superseded during the first few decades of the 20th century, first by quantum mechanics and then by quantum field theory. As a general theory of dynamics, Lorentz and Poincare had already (by about 1905) found it necessary to invoke the principle of relativity itself in order to make the theory match all the available empirical data. By this point, most vestiges of a substantial aether had been eliminated from Lorentz's \"aether\" theory, and it became both empirically and deductively equivalent to special relativity. The main difference was the metaphysical postulate of a unique absolute rest frame, which was empirically undetectable and played no role in the physical predictions of the theory, as Lorentz wrote in 1909, 1910 (published 1913), 1913 (published 1914), or in 1912 (published 1922).\n\nAs a result, the term \"Lorentz aether theory\" is sometimes used today to refer to a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity. The prefix \"neo\" is used in recognition of the fact that the interpretation must now be applied to physical entities and processes (such as the standard model of quantum field theory) that were unknown in Lorentz's day.\n\nSubsequent to the advent of special relativity, only a small number of individuals have advocated the Lorentzian approach to physics. Many of these, such as Herbert E. Ives (who, along with G. R. Stilwell, performed the first experimental confirmation of time dilation) have been motivated by the belief that special relativity is logically inconsistent, and so some other conceptual framework is needed to reconcile the relativistic phenomena. For example, Ives wrote \"\"The 'principle' of the constancy of the velocity of light is not merely 'ununderstandable', it is not supported by 'objective matters of fact'; it is untenable...\"\". However, the logical consistency of special relativity (as well as its empirical success) is well established, so the views of such individuals are considered unfounded within the mainstream scientific community.\n\nJohn Stewart Bell advocated teaching special relativity first from the viewpoint of a single Lorentz inertial frame, then showing that Poincare invariance of the laws of physics such as Maxwell's equations is equivalent to the frame-changing arguments often used in teaching special relativity. Because a single Lorentz inertial frame is one of a preferred class of frames, he called this approach Lorentzian in spirit.\n\nAlso some test theories of special relativity use some sort of Lorentzian framework. For instance, the Robertson–Mansouri–Sexl test theory introduces a preferred aether frame and includes parameters indicating different combinations of length and times changes. If time dilation and length contraction of bodies moving in the aether have their exact relativistic values, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived and the aether is hidden from any observation, which makes it kinematically indistinguishable from the predictions of special relativity. Using this model, the Michelson–Morley experiment, Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, and Ives–Stilwell experiment put sharp constraints on violations of Lorentz invariance.\n\nFor a more complete list with sources of many other authors, see History of special relativity#References.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They had a passion for diving, and developed the diving regulator with the aid of the engineer Émile Gagnan. Frédéric Dumas then participated with Jacques-Yves Cousteau in the discovery of the underwater world and in bringing it to the attention of the general public.\n\nFrédéric Dumas was born on 14 January 1913 in Albi.\n\nA pioneer of underwater fishing on the French Riviera, he met Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Philippe Tailliez in 1937 and his exploits served as a subject in the first Cousteau film \"Par dix-huit mètres de fond\" (\"Eighteen meters deep\"), made in 1942.\n\nCousteau again chose him as an \"actor\" when he made his second film, \"Epaves\" (\"Wrecks\") in 1943, the first film featuring the new Cousteau-Gagnan aqua-lung.\n\nDumas was a dive leader aboard the RV \"Calypso\", and co-author or actor in many films and stories from the Cousteau team.\n\nIn 1953 he co-authored with Cousteau the book \"\". It was their first book. In 1956 he was one of the principal architects of the ground-breaking film \"The Silent World\", in which his ballet with the grouper Ulysses (Jojo in French) is famous.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1965, Dumas was also a civilian collaborator in the French Navy's (GRS or Underwater Research Group), which was set up by Cousteau and Taillez. It later became the \"Groupe d'Études et de Recherches Sous-Marines\" (GERS or Undersea Study and Research Group) and is nowadays known as \"CEllule Plongée Humaine et Intervention Sous la MER\" (CEPHISMER or Human Diving and Underwater Intervention Cell).\n\nIn 1946, Cousteau and Dumas dove into the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring in the village of Vaucluse, hoping to discover the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the guide rope which allowed Cousteau and Dumas to communicate with the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas became affected by carbon monoxide in their air cylinders, Fargues saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface.\n\nDumas was one of the major players in the rescue of Professor Jacques Piccard's bathyscaphe, the FNRS II, during the 1949 expedition in Dakar. Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy could use the bathyscaphe's sphere in creating the FNRS III.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Sea Research Society and served on the Society's Board of Advisors. In 1972 Dumas participated in the creation of the research/professional degree of Doctor of Marine Histories.\n\nAfter he retired from the GERS, he devoted himself particularly to undersea archaeology and was chairman of the archaeology committee of the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS or World Underwater Activities Federation) and the Fédération Française d'Études et de Sports Sous-Marins (FFESSM, French Undersea Studies and Sports Federation).\n\nFrédéric Dumas died on 26 July 1991 in Toulon at the age of 78.\n\n\nOpened in 1994, the is in a 13th-century Romanesque tower made available by the municipality of Sanary-sur-Mer where Cousteau had a Villa and that bills itself as an historical city of diving.\n\n"}
{"id": "2299477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299477", "title": "Noseband", "text": "Noseband\n\nA noseband is the part of a horse's bridle that encircles the nose and jaw of the horse. In English riding, where the noseband is separately attached to its own headstall or crownpiece, held independently of the bit, it is often called a cavesson or caveson noseband. In other styles of riding, a simple noseband is sometimes attached directly to the same headstall as the bit.\n\nA noseband may have been one of the first tools used by humans to domesticate and ride horses. The bit developed later.\n\nThe noseband was originally made of leather or rope. After the invention of the bit, the noseband was, in some cultures, demoted to a halter worn beneath the bridle that allowed the rider to remove the bit from the horse's mouth after work and leave a restraining halter on underneath, or to tie the horse by this halter, instead of by the bit, which could result in damage to the horse's mouth if it panicked. However, its ability to hold a horse's mouth shut over the bit was also recognized, as was its usefulness for attaching equipment such as a martingale, and so in some traditions it was sometimes left as a working part of a bridle. Still other cultures, such as that of Ancient Persia, developed the noseband as a tool for training young horses, called a \"hakma,\" and this training noseband evolved into modern equipment such as today's bosal-style hackamore and Longeing cavesson.\n\nToday, there are also many styles of bitless bridle that rely on a noseband as the main method of communication and control. \n\nToday, the noseband has several uses:\n\n\nThere is a correlation between the sensitivity of a noseband and the amount of tension needed in the reins to obtain a response from the horse. In a 2011 study of horses being ridden in English riding equipment with the noseband in one of three adjacent adjustments, greater rein tension was needed to get a response from the horses when they had the looser adjustment. However, the study did not go on to examine the effects of no noseband at all or a very tight adjustment. Thus, nosebands may add some pressure to the nose when the reins are applied, depending on adjustment, style and the degree to which the horse resists the bit. With a soft leather noseband on a well-trained horse, the effect is minimal.\n\nA bridle does not necessarily need a noseband, and many bridles, such as those used in Western riding, flat racing, or endurance riding, do not have one. Some horses shown in-hand do not use a noseband in order to better show off the animal's head. Many old paintings also depict a hunting horse without a noseband, since it was not always deemed useful by certain riders.\n\nHowever, even in disciplines such as western riding, where it is considered a sign of a polished horse to not require a noseband or cavesson, one is often used on horses in training as a precaution to help prevent the horse from learning bad habits such as opening the mouth and evading the bit.\n\nIn the English riding disciplines, the most common design of cavesson noseband is the Plain or French cavesson, a noseband that encircles the nose 1–2 inches below the cheekbone. This type of noseband is seen in most English disciplines, especially in dressage, show hunters, saddle seat, equitation and field hunters, but is the basic noseband for all disciplines. This noseband comes in various styles from a plain flat leather suitable for hunting, to raised, double raised, fancy stitched, colored and padded styles. All of them perform the same purpose.\n\nOther designs include:\n\n\nThe flash nose band was named for King George III's horse Bold Flash. It was developed by a stable hand to increase King George's control over his mount.\n\n\nNoseband and cavessons generally used only for training, or ground handling, include:\n\n\nIn western riding, nosebands are not generally worn with an ordinary working bridle. Nosebands attached to the cheekpieces of the bridle, used purely for decorative purposes, were popular during the 1950s and in many western movies, but are not common today. When nosebands are used with western equipment, they usually fall into one of three categories:\n\nDifferent styles of noseband are fitted according to their purpose. A horse must be able to part its teeth and open its mouth slightly (not visible on the outside) in order to flex correctly at the jaw, relax and come onto the bit. An excessively tight noseband will prevent this. If a horse cannot relax its jaw, it will have problems with proper head carriage, and the rider may then try to force the horse into position by pulling back on the reins or using artificial leverage devices.\n\nStandard adjustment of a noseband is to allow one or two fingers between the noseband and the nasal bone of the horse's head, though many riders adjust it tighter. Research is ongoing to determine stress and pain levels related to excessively tight nosebands. Recent studies in equitation science now strongly recommend that traditional and crank nosebands be adjusted so that two fingers can be inserted at the \"nasal midline\"—where the noseband crosses the top of the nose. The International Society for Equitation Science has stated that tight nosebands may lead to physiological stress and mask unwanted behavior and they encourage competition rules to be amended to require horse show stewards to check noseband tightness with a standardized gauge and see that competitors adjust their equipment accordingly.\n\n\n"}

Its railway station is located approximately east at Campsea Ashe. It is a large village with 2,204 residents living in 953 dwellings (2001 census). 27.59% of the population are between the ages of 40 and 59 and 23.19% of residents reside in council or housing association homes. The population at the 2011 Census had decreased to 2,156.\n\nWickham Market's All Saints Church is over 700 years old and its octagonal tower and lead spire (137.5 feet tall) dominate the skyline and make it visible for miles over the surrounding countryside. The exterior of the church is stone and flintwork. Inside there are four stained glass windows, a 600-year-old font, a carved pulpit and an altar table with a painted reredos. There are six bells in the tower and a Sanctus Bell in the cote. Nearby attractions include: Valley Farm Equestrian Visitor Centre, Easton Farm Park, Glevering Hall, the Snape Maltings, Framlingham Castle and Sutton Hoo.\n\n\n\nWickham Mill is a grade II* listed watermill dating from the 18th century. The machinery is complete and in working order. In 1893 mill owner Reuben Rackham purchased a Whitmore and Binyon horizontal condensing steam-engine for his mill, priced at £25,000, to drive the entire plant. The engine was installed in July 1893 and the entire plant was operational by October of the same year. The engine was last worked in 1957 and was subsequently moved to Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket as a gift of Edward and Robert Rackham, Rueben Rackham's sons.\n\nIn 2009 it was announced that one of the largest Iron Age coin finds had been discovered at a site near Wickham Market.\n\nThe hoard of 840 Iron Age gold staters was found in March 2008, in a field at Dallinghoo near the village, by car mechanic, Michael Dark using a metal detector. After excavation of the site, a total of 825 coins were found, and by the time the hoard was declared treasure trove, 840 coins had been discovered.\n\nThe hoard was described as \"the largest hoard of British Iron Age gold coins to be studied in its entirety\", and was also significant in providing \"a lot of new information about the Iron Age, and particularly East Anglia in the late Iron Age\". It was the largest hoard of staters to be found since the Whaddon Chase Iron Age hoard in 1849.\n\nThe coins dated from 40 BC–15 AD and, at the time, would have been worth between £500,000–£1,000,000 to the Iceni tribes who inhabited the area.\n\n"}

Operations were managed by a committee headed by the Chief Justice of Bombay. The School's first class was in drawing, and began on 2 March 1857. Classes were held at the Elphinstone Institution. John Griffiths became Principal of the School in 1865. He later became famous for copying the murals in the Ajanta Caves temple complex, a project which lasted from 1872 to 1891, and which the School's students assisted in.\n\nIn 1866, management of the school was taken over by the Government of India.

He was the father of the author Rudyard Kipling, who was born on the School's campus. In 1878, the school moved to its own building, where it is currently situated. The building was designed by architect George Twigge Molecey, in neo Gothic architecture. The School campus, including the Kipling House, better known as the Dean's Bungalow, is classified as Grade II heritage structure by the Government of Maharashtra, and underwent a restoration in 2002-2006, and again in 2008.\n\nDrawing instruction as a subject was introduced in 1879 and a programme for training drawing teachers was started in 1893. In 1891 the Lord Reay Art Workshops (now known as the Department of Art-Crafts) were established.\n\nThe School had an important tradition in architecture. In 1900. the School offered its first course in architecture, taught by John Begg, later Consulting Architect of Bombay and of the Government of India. A complete 4-year programme was established in 1908 under Begg's assistant George Wittet.

The first Monday Night Football game broadcast was between Manchester City and Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1992, which ended in a 1–1 draw. To give the broadcasts a different look to Sky's \"Super Sunday\" strand, the broadcaster introduced the \"Sky Strikers\", a dance troupe similar to American cheerleaders. This pre-match and half-time entertainment was dropped after the first season.\n\nThe show had a number of different formats after its launch. The first change led to the merging of Andy Gray's Boot Room format into the show; analysing the previous weekend's football matches utilising the latest computer technology combined with Gray's individual analysis. As the UEFA Champions League gained in importance for Premier League clubs, the number of games played on Monday night declined. Sky Sports then reverted to a format similar to that of \"Ford Super Sunday\" with a presenter (Jeff Stelling) and studio guests.\n\nIn 2004–05, the analysis section was then incorporated into an additional programme shown after \"Ford Super Sunday\" called \"Ford Super Sunday: The Last Word\".\n\nThe show ended after the 2006–07 season when Setanta and subsequently ESPN obtained the rights for Monday night Premier League games.\n\n\"Monday Night Football\" returned from the 2010–11 season after Sky regained the rights to Monday night Premier League games. The games broadcast kick off at 8:00 pm on Monday nights. The show also started broadcasting in high-definition. Due to the structure of the broadcasting packages for the 2010–13 seasons, Sky broadcast a minimum of 12 live Premier League games on Monday nights.\n\nBefore the departures of Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the programme had a different appearance to Super Sunday, presented by Keys and Gray from a purpose-built studio with Andy Gray's analysis also returning from its Sunday evening slot. After the pair's unscheduled departure from Sky in January 2011, the first half-hour of analysis was dropped, and for the remainder of the season the show was presented from the stadium in largely the same format as Sunday or midweek Premier League matches with a rotation of presenters and pundits, although the distinct \"MNF\" branding and graphics were retained.\n\nEd Chamberlin was given the presenting role for the 2011–12 season, with Gary Neville as the new analyst. The show also returned to its previous format in the purpose-built analysis studio, with Chamberlin and Neville carrying out the same roles as Keys and Gray the previous season.\n\nIn 2013, Jamie Carragher joined the \"Monday Night Football\" show, to form a regular three-man line-up alongside Chamberlin and Neville, after having announced his retirement from football at the end of the 2012–13 season. The first Monday Night Football of the 2013-14 season and Jamie Carragher's first appearance aired on 19 August 2013 with the Manchester City against Newcastle United game. Manchester City won the game 4–0.\n\nFollowing Neville's appointment as head coach of Valencia in December 2015, he left the show to focus on his managerial duties. After leaving Valencia in March 2016 due to a poor run of results, Neville's return to Sky in his previous role was confirmed on 10 August 2016 ahead of the 2016–17 Premier League football season; he made his on-air return on 14 August.

At the age of seventeen he entered the Naval College at Saint Petersburg, from which he graduated in 1904.\n\nHe served on board a number of ships before signing on as navigator aboard the , under Captain Georgy Brusilov, for an intendend expedition to traverse the Northern Sea Route – a feat which only once before had been successfully completed, by explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld.\n\nThe expedition was ill-planned and ill-executed by Brusilov, and the \"Svyataya Anna\" became locked in the sea ice of the Kara Sea in October 1912. Supplies were abundant, so officers and crew prepared themselves for wintering, hoping to be freed in the following year's thaw. However, during 1913, the sea remained completely frozen. By early 1914, the ship had drifted with the ice northwest of Franz Josef Land, and did not seem likely to be freed that year either.\n\nAlbanov, believing that their position was hopeless, requested permission from Captain Brusilov to be relieved from his duties as second-in-command to leave the ship and attempt to return to civilization on foot. Albanov's aim was to reach Hvidtenland, the northeasternmost island group of Franz Josef Land. He used Fridtjof Nansen's inaccurate map, full of dotted lines where the archipelago was still unexplored. \n\nThirteen other crewmen accompanied Albanov when he travelled south-westwards by ski, sledge, and kayak. The progress was difficult because of the cracks in the ice, the numerous polynias and the abundance of ridges which made progress slow. After a long and gruesome ordeal, only Albanov and one crewman, Alexander Konrad, made it to Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, where they knew that Frederick George Jackson had left provisions and a hut in a previous expedition. Albanov and Konrad were rescued by timely arrival of the \"Svyatoy Foka\" under the command of Georgy Sedov, while they were preparing for the winter.\n\nAlbanov was later convinced to write up his memoirs of his adventure, and they were first published in Saint Petersburg in 1917. He returned to the sea, but died only a few years later.\n\nAccounts of his death vary, with some having him die of typhoid, and some reporting that he was killed in the explosion of a railway wagon carrying munitions in Achinsk, in the Governorate of Yeniseysk in Siberia.\n\nThe data about the drift of the \"Svyataya Anna\" on the pack ice of the Kara Sea supplied by Albanov were carefully studied in 1924, by Soviet oceanographer Vladimir Wiese. He detected an odd deviation of the path of the ship's drift caused by certain variations of the patterns of sea and ice currents. Wiese deemed that the deviation was caused by the presence of an undiscovered island whose coordinates he was able to calculate with precision thanks to Albanov's data. This island was later discovered and named Wiese Island.\n\nIn 1975, Arctic expert William Barr wrote, \"The name of Valerian Ivanovich Albanov must be ranked among those of the immortals of polar exploration.\"\n\nA glacier in October Revolution Island, in the Severnaya Zemlya group has been named after Valerian Albanov. A Russian expedition in September 2010, following the route of the crew members left behind, found some remainders of them: a human skeleton, a watch, snowshoes, a knife, a spoon with a sailor's initials, and sunglasses made from empty rum bottles' glass in the shores of Franz Josef Land.\n\n\n"}

Completed in 1905, it was Britain's first transporter bridge and the largest of its type ever built in the world. It continued in use until 22 July 1961, when it was replaced by a through arch bridge, now known as the Silver Jubilee Bridge. The transporter bridge was then demolished.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the only means of crossing the river Mersey at Runcorn Gap were by rail on the Runcorn Railway Bridge (which also had a footpath) or by using the ancient ferry (a rowing boat). In the 1890s the Manchester Ship Canal had been constructed and this meant that the journey by ferry had to be made in two stages, with a climb over the wall of the canal between the stages. A road bridge was clearly needed but it would have to pass high enough over the canal to allow the passage of ocean-going ships. The cost of doing this was felt to be prohibitive.\n\nIn 1899 the Widnes & Runcorn Bridge Company was established under the chairmanship of Sir John Brunner to investigate the options. Their decision was to build a transporter bridge. This would be cheaper than an orthodox type of bridge and the passage of the transporter car could be timed to allow the passage of the ships. The first transporter bridge in the world had been opened in 1893 in Bilbao, Spain. This had been followed in 1898 by transporter bridges in Rouen (France) and Bizerta (now Tunisia). Parliamentary approval had already been obtained for a transporter bridge over the River Usk at Newport, Monmouthshire. This was then followed by the construction of a transporter bridge in Middlesbrough over the River Tees in 1911.\n\nAn Act of Parliament was obtained in 1900 giving approval for the bridge, and the Act also allowed for the formal ending of the ferry. It was designed by John Webster and John Wood. Construction began in December 1901 and was completed in 1905. The cost was £130,000 (). The transporter bridge was opened (in the absence of King Edward VII who was indisposed) by Sir John Brunner on 29 May 1905.\n\nDuring the following years there were problems both with the functioning of the bridge and with its financing. The Company could not make it pay and in 1911 it was sold to Widnes Corporation. A number of improvements were made to the bridge over the years. In its later years it made 49,000 journeys annually, carrying 280,000 cars, 145,000 commercial vehicles and over 2 million passengers. However, it was inadequate for the growing needs of the region and its physical condition was deteriorating. A fixed high-level bridge was needed and this was eventually opened on 21 July 1961. The transporter bridge closed the following day and was later demolished.\n\nThe two towers were high and the distance between them spanned by a truss was . The weight of the cables suspending the girder was 250 tons. The underside of the girder was above the high water level. The transporter car was long and wide and was designed to carry 4 two-horse farm waggons and 300 passengers. A shelter was provided for the passengers. The bottom of the car was above high water level and it cleared the ship canal wall by . It was suspended from a moving trolley long. In conditions of reasonable weather and load the journey took 2.5 minutes. The driver was sited in a cabin on top of the car from which he had an uninterrupted view in all directions. An endless wire rope, pulled by a winch housed in the power house, provided the power to move the trolley across the River Mersey. The winch on the Widnes side pulled the trolley towards Widnes and Runcorn in turn. Approach roads of on the Widnes side and on the Runcorn side were built.\n\nThe former approaches to the transporter bridge at the bottom of Waterloo Road, Runcorn, and Mersey Road, Widnes, can still be seen. On the Widnes side the power house remains and it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. Transporter Building, the former office building, also remains nearby in Mersey Road.\n\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "2299544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299544", "title": "Constantin Zureiq", "text": "Constantin Zureiq\n\nConstantin K. Zurayk () (April 18, 1909 – August 11, 2000) was a prominent and influential Syrian Arab intellectual who was one of the first to pioneer and express the importance of Arab nationalism. He stressed the urgent need to transform stagnant Arab society by means of rational thought and radical modification of the methods of thinking and acting. He developed some ideas, such as the \"Arab mission\" and \"national philosophy\", which were to become key concepts for Arab nationalist thinkers, and in more recent years was a strong proponent of an intellectual reformation of Arab society, emphasizing the need for rationalism and an ethical revolution.\n\nHe is credited with coining the term \"Nakba\" to refer to the expulsion of the Palestinians from their lands in 1948.\n\nConstantine Zurayk was born in Damascus, Syria Vilayet on April 18, 1909 during the waning years of the ruling Ottoman Empire, to a Greek Orthodox Christian family. He received his primary and secondary education in the Orthodox school systems and had an obsession with acquiring knowledge. He continued his education at the American University of Beirut, and eventually received his PhD at Princeton University all by the age of twenty-one. He immediately turned to teaching and became a Professor of History at the American University of Beirut. \n\nAfter receiving his PhD, Zurayk focused his aims in teaching and politics. Alongside his work as a tenured professor, Zurayk experimented as the 1st Counselor to the Syrian Legation of the United States in 1945, and acted as the Delegate to the UN Security Council and to the UN General Assembly in 1946.\n\nZurayk later took an offer to become the Vice President of the American University of Beirut in 1952, and completed his education by receiving his Doctorate in Literature at the University of Michigan in 1967.\n\nHe died in Beirut.\n\nDuring the last fifty years of his life, Zurayk dedicated himself in attempting to solve the various issues revolving around Arab society. His goal was to discover a means of radically and expeditiously transforming Arab society into a practical, rational, and scientific society. Zurayk focused his attention on contemporary Arab society and the current crisis of Arab civilization. He blamed the change in Arab personality as the reason for the weakened Arab civilization. Zurayk noted that the turning away from the “ideas of unity, loyalty, and the universal outlook led to the replacement of the spiritual motivations with material ones”. Although this process of decline was an internal cause, Zurayk attributed the cause of the Nahda, or modern Arab renaissance, to external factors. One of the external contributors, which Zurayk believed played a significant role in demanding change in Arab society, was “Western” or modern civilization. Because the West would continue to impose itself on Arab society, it was imperative that the Arabs work to understand and comprehend it in order to confront it. Zurayk urged the Arab society to keep up with modern civilization and accept, rather than disregard, the scientific and technological influences of modern civilization.\nIn order to revitalize the Arab society, Zurayk demanded that there must be a radical change in Arab life. He called “for science and productivity,” and warned that the advancement of Arab society is dependent on whether that notion became a part of Arab’s “feelings and thoughts and a source of their will”.\n\nAlthough science and technology were of utmost importance, Zurayk considered ideals of citizenship, nationalism, and unity as additional, necessary requirements for the modernization of Arab society. Zurayk insisted that the combination of rational powers and ethical powers would lead to a successful future.\n\nZurayk delved deeper to describe the primary challenge of Arab civilization. He believed rationalism was the “prerequisite that encompassed all other prerequisites” for a future, modern Arab society. The cultural backwardness remained the most dangerous battle in the fight for a modern Arab society, and only through rational thinking would the Arab society look towards the future, realize their human potentials, and build a higher civilization.\n\nZurayk made it clear that Arab society must join the modern world, and to do this, they must change their previous ways. Zurayk even left a list of changes that must be made in order for a revolution to succeed: there must be use of the machine on a wide scale, the state and religion must be separated, the scientific spirit of each individual and the society as a whole must be invigorated, and Arab society must be open toward the rational and spiritual values of other human civilizations.\n\nFor Zurayk, the human powers that make culture are the civilizational powers of human reason in its critical and creative functions. Zurayk focused on the values of honesty, hard work, perseverance, seriousness, commitment, responsibility, and freedom as the values that allow humans to acquire scientific knowledge and to develop a sense of beauty and justice. In this regard, Zurayk was inspired by the prominent Egyptian intellectual, Taha Hussein, who sternly believed that the advancement of Arab society was dependent on the education of every individual. Hussein was the Minister of Education at Cairo University in 1950 and was eventually able to provide free education for all Egyptians. Both intellectuals sought to help Arab people uncover their hidden gems that would lead to a more advanced Arab society. Zurayk focused on encouraging the Arab people to access their hidden human powers which would enable them to work toward a just and moral society. He introduced what he called the “revolution of reason,” where he called for a national Arab unity based on a “secular democracy in which diverse individuals and communities can fulfill themselves in a framework of tolerance and mutual respect”.\n\nFor Zurayk, Arab nationalism was a “civilizational project rather than a defensive obsession with identity boundaries in need of protection”. For the project to become successful, the responsibilities of the Arab people were great. Zurayk emphasized that Arab culture must be “earned and created by human effort”. In his book \"In the Battle for Culture\" (1964), Zurayk further stresses the importance of the decisive role of human agency:\n\n“The main factors in civilizational changes are in our view acquired volitional human factors... Natural or environmental factors, such as race and heredity, geographic situation, economic system, and social, intellectual, and moral conditions, are all possibilities or bonds. And possibilities and bonds do not make life, nor do they give rise to cultures. It is the human being who becomes aware of these bonds and strives to overcome them, and who realizes the possibilities and works to fulfill them, who is the maker. It is with this awareness and this striving that civilizations rise and fall”.\n\nZurayk essentially rejected the doctrines of determinism and monism that prevailed in theories of culture such as the progressive reason in European Enlightenment thinking, the evolutionary progress in the positivism of Darwin, and the will of God in monotheism. He believed the doctrines to be “superimposed on human history rather than derived from its concrete givens”.\n\nZurayk's first notable publication, based on a lecture that he gave in 1938, was entitled \"The Arab Consciousness\" (al-Wa`i al-`Arabi). In the book, he introduced the concept of the \"Arab mission\" and stated that the aim of each nation was \"the message it brings to human culture and general civilization\" and that a nation without a mission was not worthy of the name. The consciousness of having a \"national mission\" would bring the Arab struggle for independence new strength and meaning and would regain for the Arabs their world role. As for the Arab mission itself, in the current age it would be “to absorb the knowledge of the West and to join it with the views that have arisen in reaction to it, and to combine them in a new unity that will be a sign of the coming life, and that the Arabs will spread to the world as they spread their brilliant civilization in the past ages”.\n\nIt was also in this work that Zurayk called for a \"national philosophy\", which he expressed as the thought absorbed by the youth of the nation combined with their feelings to form a \"nationalist creed.” Such a philosophy, he declared, was necessary for national renewal.\n\nWhile many enlightened thinkers believed religion was not a determining factor of a nation, Zurayk “sought to establish a rapport between Islam and Arab nationalism”. Throughout his research and observation, Zurayk indeed made a connection between religion and nationalism. Although he was not Muslim himself, Zurayk believed Islam was the missing link for Arab nationalism. Arab society was spiritually awakened “wherever [Islam] was established and spread.” To Zurayk, it was simple: whenever Islam was flourishing, so was Arab civilization; and whenever Islam “reduced itself to beliefs transmitted blindly and religious laws and statutes unwisely imposed, Arab civilization waned”.\n\nMany Arab thinkers insisted the Arab nation existed and prospered prior to Islam, while Islamists define the nation based on the religious community. Zurayk looked at the issue from a different perspective. In essence, he viewed Arab Nationalism as a spiritual movement much like any religion, Islam in particular. He made clear, “true nationalism cannot in any way contradict true religion, for in its essence it is a spiritual movement which aims at resurrecting the inner forces of the nation and at realizing its intellectual and spiritual potentialities”.\n\nFurthermore, Zurayk explained the significance of Muhammad and his connection to Arab nationalism. He reiterated the importance of cultural heritage in that it must not be forgotten to build a modern Arab society. Zurayk explained how Muhammad came to the Arab world in a time of great need and unified the community. He was a man of conviction who put up with persecution and humiliation all for the sake of inspiring and transforming his fellow companions to broaden their horizons and access their potentials to build a new civilization. Zurayk concluded his argument by saying: “Whatever his sect or religious community, therefore, it is the duty of every Arab to interest himself in his past culture. This interest is the first duty enjoined on him by his nationality. He must come forward to study Islam and understand its true nature and thus sanctify the memory of the great Prophet to whom Islam was revealed”.\n\nFor Zurayk, the role of intellectuals remained crucial in efforts to \"raise the level of the masses\" and bring Arab society out of its weakened condition. Analyzing the Arab response to their failure to prevent the establishment of the Zionist state of Israel, Zurayk wrote in his book \"The Meaning of Disaster\" that:\n\n“Seven Arab states declare war on Zionism in Palestine, stop impotent before it, and turn on their heels. The representatives of the Arabs deliver fiery speeches in the highest international forums, warning what the Arab state and peoples will do if this or that decision be enacted. Declarations fall like bombs from the mouths of officials at the meetings of the Arab League, but when action becomes necessary, the fire is still and quiet and steel and iron are rusted and twisted, quick to bend and disintegrate”.\n\nZurayk later reaffirms his thoughts on stagnant Arab society by stating:\n\n“The reason for the victory of the Zionists was that the roots of Zionism are grounded in modern Western life, while we for the most part are still distant from this life and hostile to it. They live in the present and for the future, while we continue to dream the dreams of the past and to stupefy ourselves with its fading glory”.\n\nZurayk had a strong view on history and rejected all forms of “historical determinism and all forms of dogmatic ideological reading of history”. His most critical belief was that of Arab history in particular. He rejected the thin view of Arab history that limited it to Islamic history. Zurayk felt Arab history needed to be understood in the widest sense possible and needed to be explored in connection with other ancient civilizations of the area. He firmly expressed that history should be judged with a mind completely free of dogma.\n\nZurayk's “revolution of reason” proved to be his most influential contribution to modern Arab liberal thought. He called for a national Arab unity based on a “secular democracy in which diverse individuals and communities can fulfill themselves in a framework of tolerance and mutual respect”. Since Zurayk grew up in an Orthodox Christian family, tolerance was a key tenet. In order to have a unified and sufficient Arab society, Zurayk asked for openness to interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution with such communities as the Jews, Christians, and Muslims.\n\nUnlike other Arab intellectuals, Zurayk did not see reason as the blind imitation of the West. Rather, he saw critical reason more as the “dominating characteristic of modernity, with all its achievements and weaknesses”. Like enlightenment through critical reason, Arab unity still remained the ultimate goal in the eyes of Zurayk. His approach was distinguished by an “ethical concern for unity’s ends and means. This unity, for him, [was] not the telos of an inexorable ethnic or religious destiny, but a form of solidarity for mutual empowerment by democratic means aimed at serving both individuals’ and communities’ dignity and freedom”.\n\n\n"}

The Beta Taurids are best observed by radar and radio-echo techniques.\n\nThe Beta Taurids are normally active from June 5 to July 18. They emanate from an average radiant of right ascension 5h18m, declination +21.2 and exhibit maximum activity around June 28–29 (Solar Longitude=98.3 deg). The maximum hourly rate typically reaches about 25 as seen on radar. Non-radio observers are faced with a very difficult prospect, because the Beta Taurid radiant is just 10–15 degrees west of the Sun on June 28.\n\nThese Beta Taurids are the same meteoroid stream as the Taurids (which form a meteor shower in late October). The Earth intersects this stream of debris twice, once in late October and once in late June, forming two separate meteor showers. However, because the October event occurs at night, it is far more visible and better known than the Beta Taurids, which peak during daylight hours.\n\nAsteroids associated with the β–Taurids include 2201 Oljato, 5143 Heracles, 6063 Jason, and 1991 BA.\n\n2019 was predicted to be the closest post-perihelion encounter with Earth since 1975.

{"id": "2299549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299549", "title": "Jakob Fugger", "text": "Jakob Fugger\n\nJakob Fugger of the Lily () (6 March 1459 – 30 December 1525), also known as Jakob Fugger the Rich or sometimes Jakob II, was a major German merchant, mining entrepreneur, and banker. He was a descendant of the Fugger merchant family located in the Free Imperial City of Augsburg, where he was born and later also elevated through marriage to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German \"Großbürger zu Augsburg\"). Within a few decades he expanded the family firm to a business operating in all of Europe. He began his education at the age of 14 in Venice, which also remained his main residence until 1487. At the same time he was a cleric and held several prebendaries, even though he never lived in a monastery. Fugger is held to be one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, alongside the early 20th century industrialists John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.\n\nThe foundation of the family's wealth was created mainly by the textile trade with Italy. The company grew rapidly after the brothers Ulrich, Georg and Jakob began banking transactions with the House of Habsburg as well as the Roman Curia, and at the same time began mining operations in Tyrol, and from 1493 on the extraction of silver and copper in the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary. As of 1525 they also had the right to mine quicksilver and cinnabar in Almadén.\n\nAfter 1487, Jakob Fugger was the \"de facto\" head of the Fugger business operations which soon had an almost monopolistic hold on the European copper market. Copper from Hungary was transported through Antwerp to Lisbon, and from there shipped to India. Jakob Fugger also contributed to the first and only trade expedition to India that German merchants cooperated in, a Portuguese fleet to the Indian west coast (1505/06) as well as a failed Spanish trade expedition to the Maluku Islands.\n\nWith his support of the Habsburg dynasty as a banker he had a decisive influence on European politics at the time. He financed the rise of Maximilian I and made considerable contributions to secure the election of the Spanish king Charles I to become Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Jakob Fugger also funded the marriages which later resulted in the House of Habsburg gaining the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nJakob Fugger secured his legacy and lasting fame through his foundations in Augsburg. A chapel funded by him and built from 1509 to 1512 is Germany's first renaissance building and contains the tombs of the brothers Ulrich, Georg and Jakob. The Fuggerei which was founded by Jakob in 1521 is the world's oldest social housing complex still in use. The Damenhof, part of the Fuggerhäuser in Augsburg, is the first secular renaissance building in Germany and was built in 1515.\n\nAt his death on 30 December 1525, Jakob Fugger bequeathed to his nephew Anton Fugger company assets totaling 2,032,652 guilders. He is among the most well known Germans and arguably the most famous citizen of Augsburg, with his wealth earning him the moniker \"Fugger the Rich\". In 1967 a bust of him was placed in the Walhalla, a \"hall of fame\" near Regensburg that honors laudable and distinguished Germans.\n\nJakob Fugger was born the tenth of eleven children to Jakob Fugger the Elder (1398–1469) and his wife Barbara Bäsinger (1419–1497), daughter of Münzmeister Franz Bäsinge. The Fugger family had already established themselves as successful merchants in the city. Hans Fugger, grandfather of Jacob Fugger the Rich had taken up residence in Augsburg in 1367, became a burgher through marriage and acquired considerable wealth by trading textiles with Italy. A few years before his death his son Jakob Fugger the Elder was already one of the richest citizens of Augsburg.\n\nJakob's older brothers Ulrich (1441–1510) and Georg (1453–1506) created the basis for the rise of the company in Europe. Around 1470 they founded manufactories in Venice and Nuremberg, then important centers of trade. Jakob Fugger's brothers Andreas and Hans both died young in Venice. His brother Markus was a cleric and from 1470 on a writer in a papal chancery in Rome where he died in 1478. His brother Peter died in an epidemic in Nuremberg in 1473.\n\nLoans given to Emperor Frederick III and supplies given to his entourage by Ulrich Fugger were the reason for the family being granted the lily coat of arms in 1473. The \"of the lily\" () naming after this coat of arms distinguishes this line of the Fugger family from the \"of the doe\" () branch.\n\nUntil 2009 historians assumed that Jakob Fugger, who was a minor order at the age of 12, had lived as a canon in a church located in Herrieden. A document from the Austrian state archive has now shown that Jakob Fugger was already representing his family business in Venice in 1473 at the age of 14. Other research showed that Jakob Fugger spent the years between 1473 and 1487 mostly at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the house of German merchants in Venice. Venice being one of the most important centers of trade at the time proved to be an ideal environment for Jakob Fugger's education in banking and the metal trade. His long residence in Italy also helped bring the renaissance style to the German region, with his funding the construction of the first buildings of this style that originated in Italy. Legal and architectural structures of Venice also had a significant influence on the funding of the Fuggerei which was similar to the social housing of Venice.\n\nJakob Fugger laid the foundation of his mining business in Salzburg. He provided loans to the independent silver mine owners in the Salzburg Slate Alps which had constant need for new capital. Instead of receiving the usual documents acknowledging debt he demanded \"Kuxe\", essentially becoming a shareholder in the mines, and through this forcing more and more mine operators in the area of Gastein and Schladming to sell their silver directly to the Fugger family instead of intermediary traders.\n\nJakob Fugger was responsible for his family's business in Augsburg, Tyrol, Venice and Rome. Around 1485 the family also founded manufactories in Innsbruck (since 1510 in Hall, since 1539 in Schwaz). Through a small loan he there first came into contact with Archduke Sigismund, a member of the Habsburg family. The archduke had as the sole owner of the Tyrol property rights handed out permissions for mining operations to private investors which in return had to pay a share of their profits to Sigismund. Despite this income he was constantly short of money owing to a lavish lifestyle, several illegitimate children and his extensive construction projects. A responsibility to pay the amount of 100,000 guilders of war reparations to Venice was eventually financed by Jakob Fugger. In 1488 the total debt already amounted to more than 150,000 guilders. Notable was the form of payment: Instead of paying the Fürst directly the Fugger family paid the money to his creditors as well as providing the wages for the royal court and craftsmen. In 1517 the Fugger family financed more than half of Tyrol's public budget. As a result, they were at times entitled to all the silver and copper out of Tyrol.\n\nThe expansion of high-risk, albeit very lucrative business connections to Maximilian I was undoubtedly promoted by Jakob. In his view, the House of Habsburg was bound to be the dominant power and dynasty within the German region, and as such should receive his financial and political support. Jakob Fugger met the young Roman-German king for the first time in 1489 at a Frankfurt fair.\nAt that time, his plans for the independent Duchy of Tyrol had been agreed upon with the king's chancellor, Johann Waldner. On 16 March 1490 Sigismund and the Tyrol Estates came together with King Maximilian also present. The archduke had to resign under the pressure from the estates, who accused him of mismanagement, and his possessions fell to the king. Maximilian then promised to repay all loans of its predecessor to Jakob Fugger.\n\nThus the Fugger business became one of the most important financial backers of Maximilian, who since 1486 was co-regent of the Holy Roman Empire. After his father Frederick III died in 1493 he became the reigning emperor. Despite having constant financial difficulties due to an extravagant lifestyle and many failed political projects his reign saw the kingdoms of Spain, Bohemia and Hungary gained for the House of Habsburg, not by waging war but through advantageous marriage arrangements which were funded with the help of Jakob Fugger.\n\nOn 15 July 1507 Maximilian I sold the County of Kirchberg, located at Ulm, the adjacent lordship Weißenhorn with the associated city, as well as the lordships Wullenstetten and Pfaffenhofen(Roth) from the Habsburg possessions in Further Austria to Jakob Fugger. Maximilian I who crowned himself Holy Roman Emperor in 1508 received a payment of 50,000 guilders for these sales. More sales followed in 1508 where he sold manor Schmiechen and in 1514 where he sold the lordship Biberbach to Fugger. Maximilian I elevated Jakob Fugger into nobility in 1511 and granted him the title of Imperial Count in 1514 so the former burgher could operate his business without interference from local nobility. In the course of his life Jakob Fugger also became lord of more than 50 smaller villages.\n\nCriticism from reformer Martin Luther on the Fugger business methods and novelistic portrayal from early research have led to the notion that Jakob Fugger exercised considerable power over Maximilian I the king and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, while more recent research shows that this was only partially true. However close to the end of his life Maximilian was so heavily indebted to Jakob Fugger that he had no choice but to continue his support for the emperor to still be able reclaim his outstanding debits. When Maximilian's grandson Charles V stood for election to become the next Emperor Jakob Fugger raised a sum of more than 500,000 guilders, a significant portion of his wealth and of the total amount raised in his support, to ensure the seven Prince-electors would choose him. Thereby he helped prevent the election of Francis I of France which would have endangered his claims and investments gravely, although it also made him highly dependent on the House of Habsburg. \n\nMuch later the Fugger family lost a large portion of their wealth following three Spanish state bankruptcies (1557, 1560, 1575) under the reign of Philip II of Spain.\n\nLikely at the insistence of Jakob Fugger the company became one of the first open trading companies () in Europe in 1494. At the same time, it was renamed into \"Ulrich Fugger of Augsburg and brothers\" to show the equality of the three brothers involved in business issues, even though Tyrolean sources almost universally speak of the Jakob Fugger company and central contracts of the Hungarian trade were all signed by him. At this development the greatly increased influence of Jakob within the company can be observed. Since the late 1480s Jakob Fugger more and more dominated the company's policies, although the eldest brother Ulrich still formally led the company.\n\nThe enormous growth potential in the mining and ore trade was very profitably harnessed by Jakob Fugger in the following years. As collateral for loans that he had given to the Habsburgs and the King of Hungary, he demanded mine revenues of Tyrol and the transfer of mining rights in Upper Hungary to him. Through this method he eventually established a dominant and almost monopolistic hold on the copper trade in Central Europe. With his business partner Hans Thurzó he founded the Hungarian trade in 1494. Mines funded by Fugger were constructed in Neusohl, at the time part of the Hungarian Kingdom. The expansion continued with the construction of smelting plants in Neusohl, Arnoldstein in Carinthia, Hohenkirchen in Thuringia and Moschnitz. The copper was distributed through manufactories in Breslau, Leipzig, Kraków and Ofen. For transportation to the ports of Gdańsk, Stettin, and Lübeck on the Baltic Sea Fugger funded the construction of a new road across the Jablunkov Pass. From those ports the copper was shipped to the Russian region and additionally through Antwerp to Lisbon where it was an important Portuguese trade good destined for the export to India. Part of the copper was also transported through Wiener Neustadt and the Adriatic ports Triest and Zengg to the copper market in Venice. At the time mines from both Tyrol and Hungary provided the bulk of the total European production in copper which provided an incredibly advantageous position in the European market, albeit not a total monopoly.\n\nThe Fugger family were the first German trading house in a direct business relationship with the Roman Curia. In the year 1500, Jakob Fugger loaned the Vatican the money necessary to build the new St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, as well as other buildings within the Vatican. To repay Jakob the massive amount of money owed, Pope Leo X had to heavily tax the German people as well as sell indulgences, which was heavily unpopular with a large group of monks, including Martin Luther. Because of the corruption within the church, Martin Luther was prompted to write his 95 Thesis. Following the death of Pope Alexander VI in August 1503 Jakob Fugger intensified his contacts to the Vatican in Rome. For the new Pope Julius II Fugger financed the recruitment of the Swiss Guard in 1505/1506, which still exists today. Early dealings in Rome are attributed to the cleric Markus Fugger in 1473. In 1477 the Fugger business was responsible for transferring church revenues from Sweden to Rome. Between 1508 and 1524, the company leased the Roman mint, the Zecca, manufacturing 66 types of coins for four different popes. After this the Fugger family was only represented by one manufactory in Rome, mostly due to the \"Sacco di Roma\" and the less German-friendly Medici Pope Clement VII. \n\nThe commodity trade played a relatively small role compared to the two main branches of the Fugger business, banking and mining. It is only because of the associated exotic investments that Jakob Fugger's early trading expeditions take a prominent place in the history of the Fugger business.\n\nAfter Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India and the establishment of the Portuguese spice monopoly, Jakob Fugger took part in the spice trade and in 1503 opened a manufactory in Lisbon. He received permission to trade pepper, other spices, and luxury goods such as pearls and gemstones through Lisbon. Along with other merchant houses of Germany and Italy he contributed to a fleet of 22 Portuguese ships led by Francisco de Almeida that sailed to India in the year 1505 and returned in 1506. Even though one third of the imported wares had to be ceded to the King of Portugal the operation still made significant profit. Soon afterwards the King declared the spice trade a monopoly of the crown in order to secure his income and exclude foreign merchants from participating. However, the Portuguese were still largely dependent on the copper delivered by Fugger which was an essential export good for the trade with India.\n\nUnlike the Welser family, Jakob Fugger's participation in the overseas trade was very cautious and conservative, and the only other operation of this kind he invested in was a failed trade expedition to the Maluku Islands led by the Spaniard Garcia de Loaisa. There is some evidence that he financed Magellan's famed voyage.\n\nEspecially for mining projects in upper Hungary the Fugger company required enormous capital, which at the time it could not raise. Hence Cardinal Melchior von Meckau was the main sponsor of the Fugger business in 1496. The Prince-Bishop had secretly and unknown to his church chapter invested 150,000 guilders into the Fugger company in return for interest, thereby evading the official church ban on interest. When he died in Rome in 1509 this investment was uncovered. The Pope, the bishopric Brixen and the family of Meckau all claiming the inheritance now demanded the immediate payback of these assets which would have resulted in insolvency for Jakob Fugger. It was this situation that prompted Emperor Maximilian I to step in and assist his banker. On the condition of assisting Pope Julius II in a war against the Republic of Venice the Habsburg monarch was recognized as being the rightful heir of Cardinal Melchior von Meckau. The inheritance could now be settled by amortizing outstanding debts. Fugger also had to deliver jewels as compensation to the Pope. However, in return for his support, Maximilian I demanded the continuous financial support of his ongoing military and political campaigns.\n\nSince the death of his brothers Georg in 1506 and Ulrich in 1510, Jakob Fugger was now running the Fugger business as the sole policy and decision maker. The company was renamed into \"Jakob Fugger und Gebrüder Söhne\" (Jakob Fugger and Brothers Sons). In the following years up until his death Jakob Fugger managed to raise the family fortune which amounted to about 200,000 guilders in 1511 to more than 2,000,000 guilders, perhaps 2% of Europe's GDP.\n\nEmperor Maximilian died in January 1519 and bequeathed to his grandson Carlos I the hereditary lands of House Habsburg with adjoining Burgundian lands as well as a disputed claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. To secure his essential investments into House Habsburg Jakob Fugger decided to support the election of the 19-year-old claimant to the throne. In addition to Carlos I, the English King Henry VIII, the French King Francois I and Frederick III, Elector of Saxony announced their candidacy. Francois I had already secured the votes of the Archdiocese of Trier and the Electorate of the Palatinate as well as offering a sum of 300,000 guilders of election money. The Prince-electors consisted of the three archbishops of Mainz, Cologne and Trier in addition to the King of Bohemia, the Elector of the Palatinate, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony.\n\nThis was a difficult situation for Carlos I who now relied on the riches of Jakob Fugger to sway the election in his favor. Fugger transferred the enormous sum of more than 850,000 guilders to the Prince-electors which ultimately resulted in the unanimous election of Carlos I as Holy Roman Emperor on 28 July 1519. Out of this 850,000 guilders Fugger himself funded around 550,000 while another merchant house of Augsburg, the Welser family, contributed about 150,000 and three Italian bankers providing the rest. What today would be seen as bribery was common practice in the election of the Emperor. Exceptional however was the immense sums involved, mainly due to the keen competition among the princely candidates.\n\nA few days later the Pope granted Carlos I, now Charles V, the right to name himself Elected Emperor. It was only in 1530 that Charles V was crowned Emperor by the Pope in Bologna. He was the last Emperor to receive a papal coronation.\n\nCharles V, since his election reigning over a realm \"where the sun never set\", was now deeply indebted to Jakob Fugger. In 1521 the debts amounted to more than 600,000 guilders. The Emperor amortized 415,000 of this sum and in return granted the Fugger company the silver and copper mining operations of Tyrol. During the Imperial Diet of 1523 in Nuremberg it was debated whether to restrict trade capital and the number of trade establishments companies were allowed to maintain. Jakob Fugger intervened and reminded the Emperor that \"\"It is known that your imperial majesty could not have claimed the Roman crown without my help...\"\" () The added demand of repayment of all debts eventually led to all discussions of trade restrictions and limits to monopolies being dropped. In addition to this Jakob Fugger was granted a concession to mine quicksilver and cinnabar in Almadén. The Fugger company was involved in the Spanish mining business up to the year 1645.\n\nIn 1498 the 40-year-old Jakob Fugger married Sybille Arzt (also: Artzt) Grand Burgheress of Augsburg, the 18-year-old daughter of an eminent Augsburg Grand Burgher. This marriage opened the opportunity for Jakob to elevate to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German \"Großbürger zu Augsburg\") and later finally giving Jakob Fugger the long-awaited aspiration of a seat on the city council (German \"Stadtrat\") of Augsburg. Four years after the wedding, Jakob Fugger bought for his young wife 40,000 guilders worth of jewels from the treasure of Burgundy. Jakob wanted to demonstrate that he was after all equal to the Habsburgs, at least financially. However the jewels were left in a chest in the basement of his house for fear of theft and envy. The couple had no children. Seven weeks after her husband died Sybille Arzt married a business partner of Jakob and converted to the Protestant faith.\n\nJakob Fugger died on 30 December 1525. The inventory performed by his heirs revealed assets totaling 3,000,058 guilders and liabilities amounting to 867,797 guilders resulting in a surplus of 2,132,261 guilders.\n\nBecause he had no direct descendants, the company and its assets were bequeathed to his nephews Raymund and Anton Fugger, who also led the company. Anton managed to double the family's fortune once more by 1546.\n\nFugger was a lifelong Roman Catholic. According to Stein, Fugger insisted that only Catholic inhabitants should \"find care and cure\" in the Fuggerei. As the Reformation progressed, the complex found itself located in an increasingly Protestant city of Augsburg. The Fugger family financed the rise to power of the House of Habsburg, who would play a prominent role in the Counterreformation.\n\nTogether with his brother Ulrich and on behalf of his deceased brother Georg, Jakob Fugger founded the Fugger chapel in the Carmelite monastery's St. Anna church located in Augsburg. It also became the burial place of the three brothers. Construction began in 1509 and was finished in 1512. The chapel was modeled after Italian burial chapels with clear influences out of Venice and Rome, thereby becoming Germany's first renaissance construction. The interior was designed with the help of many notable German artists of the time, such as Albrecht Dürer, Hans Burgkmair, Jörg Breu the Elder and Hans Daucher. The church later became Protestant which is why only two other members of the Fugger family are buried there. The building is thought to be built in preparation for Fugger's elevation into nobility and to distance himself from the local Patricians. Furthermore, it was a medium to preserve the name and memory of Fugger in the style of the Italian \"Memoria\" architecture.\n\nThe Fugger family already owned two houses in Augsburg in prominent locations when Jakob Fugger built the Fuggerhäuser near the wine-market (now Maximilianstraße) from 1512 to 1515. Builder of this Residence was most likely Hans Hiebe. Inside the Fuggerhäuser, the Damenhof (Ladies courtyard) was modeled after the florencian style grand courtyards, thus becoming Germany's first secular renaissance building. The complex was expanded once more in 1523 to accommodate the receiving of illustrious guests. The Fuggerhäuser were the private residence and administrative center of Jakob Fugger and his wife Sybille Fugger-Arzt.\n\nLater members of the Fugger family enlarged the complex several times. The complex was mostly destroyed during air raids on Augsburg in World War II and rebuilt in a simplified way in 1955. The courtyards and several other rooms however are still in their original state. The houses are still owned by the Fugger family, partly being used to house the Fürst Fugger Privatbank.\n\nIn 1515 Jakob Fugger advocated for an improved sermon in the church of his parish St. Moritz. In 1517 Pope Leo X issued a papal bull granting Fugger and his heirs the Patronage to the church and being able to choose the priest. The foundation still exists and the Fugger family still recommends the priest.\n\nBeginning in 1516 Jakob Fugger funded the construction of a settlement for craftsmen and day laborers in need. In 1523 52 houses of the estate were built. It was first named \"Fuggerei\" in 1531. Originally it was meant to house people who were in a difficult situation through no fault of their own until they could establish stable household on their own. The yearly rent was one symbolic guilder, though additionally requested were three daily prayers in the name of Fugger and his family.\n\nThe settlement was expanded several times, lastly in 1973. About 150 people live in the Fuggerei today, still paying an annual rent of the equivalent of one guilder (0.88 €). The Fuggerei is a major tourist attraction of Augsburg and since 2006 also houses a museum. The settlement is still administered by the descendants of the Fugger family and financed through a foundation (originally from 1521).\n\nJakob Fugger made several contributions to churches and monasteries in Augsburg some of which still show the Fugger coat of arms. He funded the church San Blas in Almagro, Spain and the reconstruction of the Santa Maria dell’Anima in Rome. He also built a chapel in Oberkirchberg as well as building a palace in Weißenhorn.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is primarily remembered as the son of comedians George Burns and Gracie Allen and a regular cast member of \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" (1950–58) on CBS.\n\nBorn in Evanston, Illinois, Ronnie Burns was five weeks old when he was adopted in Chicago September 27, 1935, by George Burns and Gracie Allen. His older sister, Sandra Jean, had been adopted the year before and was then 13 months old. According to George Burns, Ronnie had been the most sickly baby up for adoption from the agency, and Gracie chose him because she particularly felt he needed their help.\n\nOn October 10, 1955, Burns joined the cast of the CBS television series, \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", playing himself but cast as a novice actor and college student studying drama who tended to look askance at his parents' comedy style. He first appeared on the show on October 18, 1954 as the bridegroom on the episode \"Gracie Gives a Wedding in Payment of a Favor\" (Season 5, Episode 3). Upon joining the show full-time, numerous episodes revolved around the fictional Ronnie Burns' dating and social life. His good looks and popularity helped the show gain the attention of younger viewers in its final years. Later he appeared on \"The George Burns Show\" (1958–59), a short-lived series produced after his mother retired from show business.\n\nBurns starred in the 1960–61 NBC comedy series \"Happy\", in which he and Yvonne Lime Fedderson played Chris and Sally Day, the parents of a talking baby. He played the manager of the Palm Desert Hotel in Palm Springs. Lloyd Corrigan, Doris Packer, and Burt Metcalfe had supporting roles.\n\nHe made an uncredited appearance as Wallace on the \"Young at Heart\" episode of \"The Honeymooners\", which featured Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason) trying to roller skate with disastrous results. Burns made a cameo appearance on \"Bachelor Father\" starring John Forsythe.\n\nNever comfortable with celebrity, Burns left acting. He produced a situation comedy, \"Wendy and Me\" (1964–65), in which his father starred. He then went into real estate investment and raised horses at a ranch he owned in Santa Ynez, California.\nHe had three sons: Brent, Brad, and Bryan Burns.\n\nRonnie Burns died November 14, 2007, of cancer, at his Pacific Palisades home.\n"}

Customers include hospitals, fire departments and diving companies.\n\nThe company was founded in Lübeck in 1889 as \"Dräger & Gerling\" by and Carl Adolf Gerling. The first patent was taken out for a reduction device for using carbon dioxide to dispense beer. In 1902 Heinrich Dräger's son Bernhard entered the management; from then on, the company was named \"Drägerwerk Heinr. und Bernh. Dräger\". Since 1970, Drägerwerk has been a public limited company, or Aktiengesellschaft (AG) in German.\n\nIn 2003, the aerospace division was sold to Cobham plc. In July 2006, it was announced that Draeger Aerospace GmbH had been acquired by B/E Aerospace, Inc.\n\nDraeger's stock has tumbled to its lowest YTD close of 66.6 EU on of 4/18/18. Its YTD high was 104.15 EU on 5/10/17. Stocks have been booming since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDräger Medical is a manufacturer of medical equipment. The company offers products and services including Emergency Care, Perioperative Care, Critical Care, Perinatal Care\nand Home Care. With headquarters in Lübeck, Germany, Dräger Medical employs nearly 14,000 people worldwide, around half of whom work in customer sales & services. R&D and production are located in Lübeck, Germany; Best, Netherlands; Richmond Hill, ON, Canada; Telford, PA, USA; Andover, MA, USA; and Shanghai, China. The company has sales and service subsidiaries in almost 50 countries and is represented in more than 190 countries.\n\nDräger Safety GmbH is a manufacturer of personal protection and gas detection technology, and a supplier of safety systems for industry, fire prevention, mining and other hazardous areas. The products and services from Dräger Safety warn and protect people from airborne pollutants and enable people to breathe reliably even in extreme situations.\n\nDräger claims to have longstanding experience, especially in the fields of gas management, gas flow control, gas monitoring and gas measurement. \nThe current product range encompasses respiratory protective equipment for firefighters, miners and other industrial personnel as well as complete air filter and air supply systems, portable and fixed gas detection and warning systems, devices for on-site or laboratory contaminant analysis, and instruments to determine a person's breath-alcohol concentration.\n\nDräger combines the practical use of equipment with, for example, consultancy services, training, maintenance, service and commissioning. Represented in over 100 countries, the company has 40 subsidiaries and, with its 3,600 employees, achieved global sales of €557.8 million in 2005 (EBIT: €40.7 million). \nDräger Safety operates production plants in Germany, Great Britain, USA, Sweden, South Africa and China.\n\nDräger Safety faces heavy competition from other manufacturers of safety equipment such as Sensidyne, LP. Also, the company's competitors include Mine Safety Appliances, Industrial Scientific Corporation and RAE Systems.\n\nDräger supports the German Firefighting Sports Federation in the German firefighting fitness badge.\n\nDräger was one of a few companies who were early pioneers of colorimetric gas detector tubes (also known as \"detector tubes\") used to measure the concentration of gases present. In a typical colorimetric gas detector tube a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different. Today colorimetric gas detector tubes are used throughout industry as a low-cost and easy-to-use tool for detecting the presence of gases and are available from a wide range of manufacturers.\n\nAn early limitation of detector tubes is that they were designed to detect a single known gas or vapor. Advancements in the design and capability of detector tubes came with the introduction of such tools as the HazMat kit. The specialty kits are designed for use by hazardous material response teams in determining what gases or vapors are present through using a \"stack\" of colorimetric material that change color based upon the presence of an organic or inorganic gas.\n\nDräger developed their first Alcohol screening kit in 1953 when some employees came into work hungover following a party the night before. It was originally developed using silicon crystals, where a breath sample was passed through these silicon crystals, if there was alcohol in this breath sample, a chemical reaction would occur resulting in the crystals changing colour. This particular method is still used today to create \"single use breathalyzers.\"\n\nDräger's first digital display Alcohol Screening Kit was developed in 1980. Later they developed a breathalyzer that uses a fuel sensor. Many of Drägers breathalyzers have home office approval, which means they can be used by the police in a variety of countries, including the UK.\n\nIn 1912 Drägerwerk developed standard diving dress which did not need surface supplied breathing gas via a diver's umbilical, as it used a self contained gas supply came from a rebreather. Two versions were available, one for oxygen to 20 metres, and the other for nitrox to 40 metres. The semi-closed circuit used the injected gas to circulate the gas in the helmet through a scrubber, providing a very low work of breathing in comparison with most other rebreathers which used the lungs of the diver to circulate gas in the loop. The \"bubikopf\" helmet was designed for use with this system. The rebreather loop hoses connected to the back of the helmet below the overhanging part, and led from there to the back-mounted scrubber.\n\nSince 1941 Hans Hass used bag-on-back rebreathers for scuba diving, originally built by Dräger for self-rescue of submarine crews (Tauchretter; like the Davis Escape Set). The first Dräger-\"Tauchretter \" had been built in 1907. In 1926 the \"Bade-Tauchretter\" was brought into service for rescuing drowning swimmers.\n\nDräger manufactured the popular Atlantis, Ray and Dolphin line of sport diving semi-closed-circuit nitrox rebreathers. It also makes the LAR-5 and LAR-6 military oxygen rebreathers, and the LAV-7 military rebreather which is switchable between closed-circuit and semi-closed-circuit.\n\nDräger made the high-altitude oxygen sets used by the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition (the second (autumn) expedition), and John Hunt was able to have adaptors made so that the 1953 British expedition could use oxygen from tanks the Swiss had left behind, particularly for their \"sleeping sets\"; see bottled oxygen. \n\n"}

They formed in 1966 and went on to become one of the top selling acts of 1967, charting their only five top 40 hits in the U.S. that year. The band dissolved in 1970, but re-formed in 1980 and they continue to tour throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1965, guitarists Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna, along with bassist Curtis Bachman, were invited to join a band called the Centuries. Giammarese and Bachman, plus keyboardist Dennis Miccolis, later became members of another band, the Pulsations, whose members included drummer John Poulos and vocalists George LeGros and Dennis Tufano. After winning a local battle of the bands competition in late 1965, the Pulsations secured a job as the house band on WGN-TV's variety show called \"All-Time Hits\". The show's producers suggested they adopt a name reflective of the British invasion, which was popular at the time, and the band adopted the name \"The Buckinghams\", which was suggested by a security guard named John Opager at the station. The band liked the name because of its similarity to a hometown landmark Buckingham Fountain.\n\nIn early 1966, LeGros was forced to leave after he was drafted. Right around the same time, bassist Bachman also left and Fortuna (now playing bass and soon briefly going under the surname of Fortune, after it was misspelled on the record jacket) returned after a stint with Jimmy V. & the Entertainers. The band then signed their first record contract with local label USA Records and recorded twelve songs that year. Several were released as singles, including \"I'll Go Crazy\", a song originally recorded by James Brown & the Famous Flames, and the Beatles' \"I Call Your Name\". However, it was their number one single, \"Kind of a Drag\", that provided them with national exposure. \"Kind of a Drag\" was written by Chicago-based songwriter Jim Holvay, who had been performing with a group called The Mob, and spent two weeks at the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in February 1967. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The co-producers of \"Kind of a Drag\" were the band's first personal manager, Carl Bonafede, and big band leader Dan Belloc, owner of the Holiday Ballroom in Chicago. The horns on the song were arranged by Frank Tesinsky and the engineer at the first recording sessions held at Chess Records in Chicago was Ron Malo. Following this, the band's debut album, also entitled \"Kind of a Drag\", was released on USA Records and featured the band's early recordings.\n\nIn late 1966, keyboardist Miccolis was replaced by Larry Nestor, who only stayed in the band a short time and was in turn replaced by Marty Grebb at the close of 1966. Around this time the band members were introduced to James William Guercio, formerly the bassist and road manager for Chad & Jeremy, who then signed them to a management contract with Ebbins-Guercio Associates. The Buckinghams were courted by several record labels before deciding on promotion specialist Jim Scully, who quickly got them a new contract with Columbia (CBS) Records. Guercio, who became the group's producer, continued the group's \"brass-rock\" approach, and the band produced four more Top-20 hits in 1967: \"Don't You Care\" (#6), \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" (#5), \"Hey Baby (They're Playing Our Song)\" (#12), and \"Susan\" (#11), (three of which were written by Jim Holvay and Gary Beisbier). The same year, the Buckinghams were named by \"Billboard\" magazine as \"The Most Listened to Band in America\". Severe differences occurred between the Buckinghams and Guercio, particularly the producer's decision to add a psychedelic section to the song \"Susan\". The song included a short portion of Charles Ives' \"Central Park in the Dark\" and sounded very similar to the Beatles' song \"A Day in the Life\", with an orchestral crescendo. Many radio stations omitted this section, since it changed the song's tempo and veered radically from the melody. But the producer had the last word, and the released version kept the psychedelic section intact. The group currently does not include the psychedelic portion in their performances.\n\nBy mid-1968, the Buckinghams had parted company with Guercio and Columbia Records assigned staff producer Jimmy Wisner to work with the group on their third album, \"In One Ear and Gone Tomorrow\". The album featured material written by Grebb, Giammarese, and Tufano. Despite the release of a new single, \"Back in Love Again\", they were unable to duplicate their 1967 success without Guercio, who went on to take the \"brass rock\" concept further with Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago. Also, a \"Buckinghams Day\" in Chicago was cancelled when it was learned that some of the band members were arrested for possession of illegal drugs.\n\nBy late 1968, Grebb and Fortuna had left and were replaced by keyboardist John Turner and original bassist Bachman, who had gone on to join the band Saturday's Child after leaving the Buckinghams. There were no more hits, though, and the band dissolved in early 1970. A double compilation record of their old material was released in 1975 by Columbia called \"Made in Chicago\".\n\nAfter the break-up, Tufano and Giammarese formed the duo Tufano & Giammarese and recorded three albums for Lou Adler's record label, Ode Records, forming a touring band in time for their second album. Drummer John Poulos, who had secured the Ode Records recording contract for the duo, became a manager of several rock bands, including the Boyzz from Illinoizz. Poulos died of drug-related heart failure on March 26, 1980.\n\nLater in 1980, Chicago's WLS radio programming executive, John Gehron, called Giammarese with an invitation to reunite the Buckinghams for Mayor Jane Byrne's ChicagoFest event in August. Giammarese, Fortuna, and Tufano appeared with drummer Tom Osfar and keyboardist John Cammelot on the Navy Pier rooftop stage. Marty Grebb declined the opportunity to join them as he was touring with the group Chicago at the time. For the next two years the trio of original members performed at selected concerts in Chicago. When Tufano decided to return to California to resume a career in film voice work in early 1983, Giammarese and Fortuna committed to tour full-time as The Buckinghams.\n\nThe 1983 Buckinghams featured an expanded group that included Giammarese, Fortuna, John Duich (guitar), Tom Taylor (keyboards), Tom Scheckel (drums, percussion), and two female singers: Laurie Beebe Lewis (vocals, keyboards), who later joined the Mamas & the Papas, and Barbara Unger (keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nIn 1984 Duich, Taylor, and Unger were dropped and Giammarese, now handling lead vocal duties, went back to playing guitar as well and Cammelot rejoined on keyboards with Lewis on vocals and supporting keyboards. The following year the Buckinghams were part of the \"Happy Together 85\" Tour, along with the Turtles, the Grass Roots, and Gary Lewis and the Playboys. That same year they released their come back album \"A Matter of Time\" on Red Label Records which included one single promo release \"Veronica\", and joined the Turtles on their US \"Happy Together\" tour with the Grassroots and Gary Lewis and the Playboys. By early 1986, both Lewis and Cammelot left the group and were replaced by Bob Abrams (guitar, vocals) and Bruce Soboroff (keyboards, vocals).\n\nIn 1991, Sony Music Entertainment (the present-day owner of Columbia Records) released a new greatest hits compilation, \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy: A Collection\". Sony Music has continued to make the Buckinghams' Columbia recordings available, as well as their recordings previously issued by USA Records.\n\nIn 1996, the Buckinghams celebrated the band's 30th anniversary with a concert at The Vic Theatre in Chicago. The show was filmed and released as a video entitled \"Off Their Rocker\" and included DJs Dick Biondi and John \"Records\" Landecker as hosts.\n\nIn 2001, the Buckinghams were part of the \"Solid Gold 60s\" Tour along with Tommy James, the Turtles, Gary Puckett, and the Grass Roots. PBS featured the Buckinghams on \"The Sixties Pop Rock Reunion\" in 2004.\n\nIn January 2005, the Buckinghams performed at the Twilight on the Prairie Ball for one of President George W. Bush's Inaugural Balls in Washington, DC. In 2007, the Buckinghams signed with national label Fuel Records to release their studio CD \"Reaching Back\", which included eight new original songs written by Giammarese and new recordings of five of their top hits. A second CD, \"Standing Room Only\" (previously released as \"Live and Well\"), was also released on the Fuel Label. XM Radio recorded the Buckinghams in concert for their XM Performance Series on the \"60s on 6\" channel. The Buckinghams' music from yesterday and today remains in regular rotation on classic rock stations in U.S. formats as well as satellite radio and streaming Internet radio stations.\n\nThe Buckinghams released their first Christmas album on the BML label, \"The Joy of Christmas\", in November 2008. In December 2008, they debuted the single \"Have a Little Faith\" on WGN-TV in Chicago.\n\nIn 2009, the Buckinghams performed at the Bipartisan Illinois Agricultural Ball for the inauguration of President Barack Obama. That same year, Sony reissued the Buckinghams' first three albums for sale as digital downloads as part of their Legacy Music Series.\n\nOn February 9, 2010, the Buckinghams released a new DVD/CD box set \"Up Close\" showing them in concert at the Star Plaza Theatre in Merrillville, Indiana.\n\nIn May 2010, Abrams and Scheckel left the Buckinghams lineup to be replaced by Dave Zane (guitars, vocals) and Bruce (Rocky) Penn (drums, percussion, backing vocals), who had played with several groups, including the Cryan' Shames for a number of years. Scheckel went on to join Paul Revere and the Raiders.\n\nOn May 20, 2010 Giammarese and Fortuna were featured in the \"25th Anniversary Happy Together Tour\", joining the Turtles, the Grass Roots, Micky Dolenz, and Mark Lindsay in a 20+-city tour from California to New York, celebrating the silver anniversary of the original Happy Together Tour in 1985. In July 2011 concerts began for the second Happy Together Reunion Tour that included the Buckinghams, the Turtles, the Grass Roots, Mark Lindsay, and the Association. Later in 2011, it was announced that Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna would join the 2012 Happy Together Tour alongside the Turtles, Micky Dolenz, the Grass Roots, and Gary Puckett. \n\nIn 2011, Giammarese completed his solo CD, \"Journey\", the companion to his biography, \"Reinventing The Buckinghams: My Journey\". \n\nOn October 16, 2015, the Buckinghams took part in the filming of \"Cornerstones of Rock : American Garage\" which aired multiple times on WTTW Chicago. \"Cornerstones of Rock\" was created to be a nostalgic celebration of the Chicago-area \"garage bands\" that rose to national prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. Jim Peterik and The Ides of March served as the house band for the evening, as many original members of these popular bands returned to the concert stage to play their greatest hits. In addition to the Buckinghams, the Cornerstones line-up included the Ides of March, the Cryan' Shames, the New Colony Six, the Shadows of Knight, the McCoys, and the American Breed. \n\nOriginal lead singer Tufano continues to tour as a solo act, and also appears in a Bobby Darin Show he created, \"As Long as I'm Singing\". Former keyboards/vocals/songwriter Grebb has played with the Fabulous Rhinestones, Lovecraft (formerly H P Lovecraft), Chicago, Bonnie Raitt, the Weight Band, and Dave Mason, and has also produced CDs for independent musicians, including Peach.\n\nGiammarese and Fortuna have continued on touring with band members Soboroff, Zane, Penn, and a horn section consisting of Carlo Isabelli (trumpet), Charles Morgan (trombone), and Dan Moffett (tenor saxophone).

The US Navy renamed her after the \"airy and playful spirit\" Ariel in William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\". The ship was returned to United Fruit in 1946 and operated for that company until sold to a German company in 1957.\n\nThe Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia built the ship as SS \"Peten\" for United Fruit Company's United Mail Steamship Co subsidiary. \"Peten\" was one of six UFC sister ships with General Electric turbo-electric transmission, the others being and from Newport News Shipbuilding and , and from Bethlehem Shipbuilding's Quincy, Massachusetts, plant, built under the Merchant Marine Act of 1928. The prospective name for the ship had been \"Segovia\", hull #345, but that hull had been burned at the outfitting pier as it neared completion in 1931 and was rebuilt as hull #354 with the new name of \"Peten\". \"Peten's\" keel was laid 9 March 1931 with launch on 15 August 1931 and delivery on 24 February 1933. On 2 March 1933 \"Peten\" made her maiden voyage from New York to Caribbean ports. In 1937 she was transferred to United Fruit's direct ownership and renamed \"Jamaica\". The ship's peacetime service was in carrying fruit, passengers and mail on regular liner services between Central America and the USA.\n\n\"Jamaica\" was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 24 March 1942 at New Orleans with allocation to the Navy under bareboat charter. Todd Pacific Shipyards of Galveston, Texas converted her for Navy use. She was renamed USS \"Ariel\" and commissioned at Galveston on 14 May 1942, commanded by Captain E.P. Hylant.\n\nOn 25 May \"Ariel\" sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. On arrival she assumed duty with Service Squadron 7, Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. In the next 18 months \"Ariel\" operated along the east coast and made numerous voyages to ports in the Caribbean. Among her stops were Bermuda; Trinidad; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Havana and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. This routine was interrupted by a voyage to Iceland in 1943. She left New York City on the 15 August and sailed to NS Argentia, Newfoundland before continuing on to Iceland and reaching Reykjavík on 24 August. After unloading her cargo she returned to the east coast, arrived back at New York City on 7 September, and resumed her supply service to the Caribbean.\n\nOn 4 January 1944 the store ship left Norfolk, with a convoy bound for the Mediterranean Sea. She called at Algiers, Algeria on 24 January and soon sailed for Naples, Italy, where she unloaded supplies. She then sailed east and called at Oran, Algeria, in early February before sailing back to the United States. The ship arrived at New York City on 13 February.\n\n\"Ariel\" sailed for the Caribbean on 20 February and called at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, to unload. She then returned to New York. In late March, she commenced another voyage to Iceland and arrived back at New York on 10 April. After a few weeks of upkeep, \"Ariel\" sailed for the United Kingdom. On arrival she provided food and supplies to ships preparing for the cross-channel Invasion of Normandy. She operated from the ports of Clyde, Scotland; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Plymouth and Portland Harbour, England. She left England on D-Day, 6 June, and returned to the United States.\n\n\"Ariel\" reached New York on 16 June. After a fortnight of leave and upkeep she sailed to Norfolk. On 1 July she set out across the Atlantic to resupply Mediterranean ports. She unloaded stores and equipment at Oran and Naples before returning to the United States \"via\" a stop in the Azores, reaching New York on 3 August.\n\nAfter a week in New York, \"Ariel\" made a round trip to supply Guantanamo Bay and Trinidad. In September she made a round trip from New York to Bermuda. On 20 September she sailed from Norfolk, VA to Oran and Naples. Her return voyage was to New York, where she arrived on 23 October. From there she took supplies to San Juan and Guantanamo Bay. In early November she returned to Norfolk for servicing. She returned to duty on 10 December, sailing laden for Oran and Naples. She returned to Norfolk on 6 February 1945. Later that month she made another round trip to Oran.\n\nIn March \"Ariel\" left New York for San Juan, Puerto Rico. She returned to the east coast and put into Boston, Massachusetts on 12 April. From there she took a cargo to Argentia and arrived back at Boston in late April. She then took a cargo to Bermuda.\n\nShe continued her supply runs to Caribbean ports from New York, Norfolk, and Boston until 1946. On 12 May 1946 \"Ariel\" left New York for a final voyage \"via\" Argentia, Newfoundland to Reykjavík, where she docked on 29 May and unloaded. She left for New York on 1 June, arrived a week later, and entered New York Naval Shipyard for decommissioning.\n\nOn 21 June 1946 \"Ariel\" was decommissioned at New York and transferred to the War Shipping Administration. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946. She was returned to former owner, the United Fruit Company, under charter under her pre-war name \"Jamaica\" until redelivered to the owners 9 December 1947.\n\n\"Jamaica\" returned to liner work for United Fruit but later was sold to new owners. In April 1957 the ship was converted to a refrigerator type. \"Jamaica\" was sold in December 1957 to Union-Partenreederei T/S of Bremen, Germany, which also acquired her United Fruit sister ship \"Chiriqui\". Union-Partenreederei changed \"Jamaica\"s name to D/S \"Blumenthal\". She was scrapped in 1969 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1952 as the Esperanto League for North America (ELNA) in Sacramento, California. Headquartered in Emeryville, California, Esperanto-USA is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and the U.S. affiliate of the Universal Esperanto Association. Phil Dorcas is President of E-USA, and Ben Speakmon is Vice-President.\n\nThe organization administers the largest Esperanto-language book service in the Americas. It publishes a bimonthly bulletin \"Usona Esperantisto\". It also publishes reference works about Esperanto. The organization's leadership consists of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and nine directors; it also has many commissioners responsible for Esperanto-USA's activity in various connections (e.g. audio-visual service; cooperation with libraries; relations with local Esperanto clubs; etc.) Membership is about 650.\n\nThe youth section of E-USA is USEJ (\"Usona Esperantista Junularo\").\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the chief Esperanto organization for the U.S. was the Esperanto Association of North America (EANA). In the early 1950s, the early days of the Cold War, EANA's president, George Allen Connor, a fierce anti-Communist, had begun his own McCarthyist attacks against leaders of the Esperanto movement in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) began debating whether to expel Connor, who also held a position in UEA's leadership, and also to break off relations with EANA, which was UEA's US national association. In protest against EANA, American Esperantists founded the Esperanto League for North America. Three years later, UEA recognized ELNA as its American section, and subsequently severed ties with EANA. By then, most EANA members had gone over to ELNA. EANA was quickly rendered insignificant, and had disappeared by the 1970s.\n\nIn 2007, the members of the organization voted to adopt the name Esperanto-USA as an alias, while retaining the formal, official name Esperanto League for North America (\"Esperanto-Ligo por Norda Ameriko\" in Esperanto). Among other reasons, the change was made because the organization's scope is limited to the U.S., despite the \"North America\" in its original title. E-USA still uses its original acronym, ELNA, but only occasionally.\n\nE-USA has held an annual convention (called a \"congress\" in accordance with Esperanto movement usage) every year since 1953, usually in the United States but occasionally in Canada or Mexico (meeting jointly with the Canadian Esperanto Association or the Mexican Esperanto Federation, respectively). The 2010 conference of E-USA took place in Bethesda, Maryland. The 2011 conference was in Emeryville, California, the 2012 conference in Dallas, Texas, the 2015 conference in Detroit, Michigan, the 2016 conference in Miami, Florida, and the 2013 and 2017 conferences in Raleigh, North Carolina. The 2018 conference occurred in Seattle, Washington, with the 2019 conference scheduled to occur in Boston, Massachusetts. Notable speakers have included Humphrey Tonkin, Katalin Kovats, and Duncan Charters.\n\n"}

A lunging cavesson consists of a heavy, padded noseband, metal rings to attach the lunge line, a throatlatch, and sometimes additional straps such as a jowl strap or a browband for added stability. It is placed on the horse's head in a manner somewhat akin to a halter, but provides significantly more control than a halter, without placing pressure on the horse's mouth as a bridle would. The noseband should be just below the cheekbone, several inches above the nostrils sitting on the nasal bone, and fitted snugly. The jowl strap should be very snug to prevent the cavesson from slipping into the horse's eye.\n\nThe key feature of a lunging cavesson is the strategic placement of rings for varying places to attach the lunge line: one at the top of the nasal bone and one each side of the noseband. Many other types of headgear may be used for lunging, but the lunging cavesson is most commonly associated with dressage and related training methods and is designed to allow more subtle communication between handler and horse.\n\nA lunging cavesson may be used with a snaffle bridle. The cavesson is put on under the bridle, with the noseband of the cavesson under the bridle cheekpieces. On some horses, the bridle cheekpieces may need to be lengthened to allow this. If the bridle also has its own cavesson, it may need to be removed to reduce bulk and avoid interference with other components.\n\n"}
{"id": "2299648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299648", "title": "Johnny Jordaan", "text": "Johnny Jordaan\n\nJohnny Jordaan was the pseudonym for Johannes Hendricus van Musscher (7 February 1924 – 8 January 1989), a Dutch singer of popular music, in particular the genre known as \"levenslied\", a Dutch variety of the French \"chanson\". He was well known for his songs about the city of Amsterdam, especially the Jordaan district (the genre dedicated to the neighborhood is known as the \"Jordaanlied\"), which he sang in a typical \"hiccuping Mokum vibrato\", \"Mokum\" being the Hebrew-derived nickname for the Amsterdam inner city area. In the 1950s, Johnny Jordaan rose almost instantly to the level of national celebrity and became the \"uncrowned king of the \"Jordaanlied\"\", and his hit song \"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\" is one of the songs Amsterdammers identify with most.\n\nJordaan was born the son of a roofer, and grew up within sight of the Westertoren, on the corner of the Lijnbaansgracht and the Rozengracht, the edge of the Jordaan—by then an impoverished working-class neighborhood. He was the oldest of two brothers in a Roman Catholic workers' family. He started singing in the streets at age 8, with his cousin Carel Verbrugge (Willy Alberti), to help provide for his family. He lost an eye during a fight with Verbrugge, at age 9. He started using the name \"Johnny Jordaan\" when he was 14, and after vocational school began working various odd jobs and singing in bars. Despite already having discovered his homosexuality, he married in 1943. After the Second World War, he got a steady job as a singer in the Amsterdam café De Kuil.\n\nIn 1955, he won a singing competition, the \"Jordaan festival\", organized by the record company Bovema in collaboration with singer and composer Louis Noiret; the aim was to find the best voices from the Jordaan. His lifelong friend Tante Leen, a notable Jordaan singer in her own right, finished second in the same competition. His first single contained two Noiret compositions, \"De Parel van de Jordaan\" and \"Bij ons in de Jordaan\". After being played on an AVRO radio program the single was an instant hit record, propelling Johnny and his Jordaan to national fame—the entire neighborhood, which had been poor and deprived since the 19th century, suddenly became popular due to the success of Johnny Jordaan and others. Cabaret artist and historian Jacques Klöters referred to 1955 as \"the year of Johnny Jordaan\": he sold hundreds of thousands of records within months, got to perform in the Concertgebouw with Tante Leen, and helped popularize the \"uncivilized\" Jordaan dialect.\n\nJohnny's own celebrity was made apparent in 1956, when he and his wife celebrated their wedding anniversary by being driven through the Jordaan in a carriage and singing in front of a crowd of 30,000 people: the Polygoon newsreel includes it among the most important events of the year. In the pillarized world of the Netherlands of the 1950s and 1960s, commercial success (\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\" sold over a million copies) did not mean receiving airplay with all broadcasting organizations—the socialist VARA, for instance, boycotted his music since it was too low-brow.\n\nFinancial mismanagement brought him financial ruin; a Jordaan-themed cabaret in Scheveningen was a flop, and a café he opened in Rotterdam in 1962 had to close due to tax debts. He avoided the tax man by leaving for Antwerp to start a café there, but longing for Amsterdam got the better of him and in 1968 he returned, with the help of Tante Leen—though he didn't move to Amsterdam immediately but rather to Beverwijk first, where he lived with his partner, Ton Slierendrecht, before moving to Amsterdam's Staatsliedenbuurt. The record company paid off his debt and Harry de Groot wrote a new song for him, \"'n Pikketanussie\", a hit song which reinvigorated his career.\n\nHis health had always been frail, and in the early 1970s he suffered further hemorrhages and a number of heart attacks. His farewell to his audience was a 1972 television show in collaboration with Tante Leen, Willy Alberti, Ramses Shaffy, Zwarte Riek, Harry de Groot, and songwriter Pi Vèriss. He did occasional shows afterwards and died at age 64, on 8 January 1989. His burial service in the Westerkerk, on 15 January, was attended by a thousand people, including many notables; thousands more crowded the surrounding area and paid their respects. National newspapers noted that many of the visitors were not usual churchgoers, and commented that Johnny had remained a singer of the people. He is buried in the family grave at Vredenhof cemetery.\n\nJordaan had married Jannetje \"Totty\" de Graaff in 1943 and the couple had a daughter, but he had spent most of his adult life repressing his homosexual feelings. After an affair with a man, he attempted suicide. His homosexuality, a well-known secret, shocked the nation. Since the late 1950s he had a male partner, Ton Slierendrecht; he finally got a divorce from Totty in 1982 to enter a legal union with Slierendrecht.\n\nJordaan's best-known songs are \"Bij ons in de Jordaan\" (\"Among us in the Jordaan\"), which celebrates the lively culture of the neighborhood, and \"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\" (\"I prefer Amsterdam\"), written by Pi Vèriss, which praises the city as preferable over any other, including Paris: \"Liever in Mokum zonder poen dan in Parijs met een miljoen\" (\"I'd rather be penniless in Mokum than a millionaire in Paris\").\n\nHis songs, especially \"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\", stand for the city in an emblematic way, and continue to be played at Amsterdam festivities—such as the 2013 championship of Ajax. For some, Amsterdam means Johnny Jordaan.\n\nTante Leen's homage (and her greatest hit) is a song called \"Oh, Johnny\"; a version she recorded with him was included on a Tante Leen collection released in 2007 (15 years after her death). Ironically, this song was written by Jaap Valkhoff, who was a famous singer-songwriter from Amsterdam's rival city of Rotterdam.\n\nThe Johnny Jordaanplein (\"Johnny Jordaan Square\"), off the Elandsgracht in the Jordaan, is named for him; the square contains statues of Jordaan and Tante Leen, and of Jordaan's regular accordionist Johnny Meijer. Since he had lived the last few years of his life in the Staatsliedenbuurt (to the west of the Jordaan), that neighborhood also vied for a square named for him; the singer had really no connection to the Elandsgracht at all, though was engaged in the Edison theater there for a month in 1957. A 1990 benefit concert in the Carré Theatre paid for a bust, which was placed on a parking lot in 1991 off the Elandsgracht. The dispute was fought out in the neighborhoods' newspapers; in the end the Jordaan won out. Local brewery De Prael brews \"Johnny\", a blonde ale—blonde for his fair hair—and in 2006 the Amsterdam Museum held an exposition to remember him, \"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\".\n\nIn 1997, a biographical musical, \"Oh, Johnny\", was performed at the Amsterdams Kleinkunstfestival. \"Bij ons in de Jordaan\" was a 2000 biographical television series on VPRO television, which focused mostly on Johnny's struggling with his gay identity in pillarized post-war Netherlands. The first Johnny Jordaan DVD, released in 2005 and also called \"Bij ons in de Jordaan\", entered the DVD music charts at No. 1. The DVD had been compiled by Peter Pols, a lifelong fan of Johnny and later his chauffeur and friend; Pols (Amsterdam, 1948–2009) collected everything related to Johnny and after his death donated his collection to the Amsterdam City Archives.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2299654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299654", "title": "Akram al-Hawrani", "text": "Akram al-Hawrani\n\nAkram Al-Hourani (, also transcribed El-Hourani, Howrani or Hurani) (1912 – 24 February 1996), was a Syrian politician who played a prominent role in the formation of a widespread populist, nationalist movement in Syria and in the rise of the Ba'ath Party. He was highly influential in Syrian politics from the beginning of the 1940s until his departure into exile in 1963. Al-Hourani held various positions including a government ministry and the joint vice-presidency of the United Arab Republic. He is the grandfather of Akram Al-Hourani (1983), a lecturer and researcher in wireless network engineering and signal processing at RMIT University in Australia.\n\nAl-Hourani's family had its origins in the Arab al-Halqiyyin tribe and moved to Hama in central Syria from the town of Jasim in the southern Hawran region (hence the surname \"Al-Hourani\".) Al-Hourani family is claimed to be descendant of the prophet Muhammad as per the family tree displayed in the museum of Hama. Akram Al-Hourani himself was born in Hama and grew up in modest circumstances as the family's wealth had dissipated. He was educated in Hama and Damascus.\n\nIn 1936, he enrolled in the Damascus Law School, and became a member of the Syrian Social National Party. In 1938 he left the party and returned to Hama to practice law. There he took over the \"Hizb al-Shabab\" (Youth Party) founded by a cousin.\n\nThe province of Hama in the earlier part of the twentieth century was characterised by feudalism, with landlords owning most of the land. The landlords exercised complete control over the peasantry, backed up by what amounted to private armies. Al-Hourani set about attacking this system and called for agrarian reforms, giving him considerable popular support in Hama and its province, and in 1943 he was elected as a deputy to the Syrian Parliament. He retained his seat in the elections of 1947, 1949, 1954, and 1962.\n\nWhile it was in defence of social justice in his home region that Al-Hourani made his name, he also had a strong Arab nationalist outlook.\nIn 1950 Al-Hourani renamed his party the Arab Socialist Party; at that point, Batatu states, \"it counted no fewer than 10,000 members and was able to attract as many as 40,000 people from the countryside when in the same year it convoked at Aleppo the first peasant congress in Syrian history.\"\n\nBetween 1949 and 1954 Syrian politics was punctuated by four military coups. Based on his strong influence in the army, Al-Hourani was considered to have played a part in these coups, however there is no concrete evidence to support that. He was initially particularly close to the leader of the third and fourth coups, Adib al-Shishakli, who effectively ruled Syria from 1951 until 1954. Al-Shishakli's decision to sign a decree distributing state lands to the peasantry in January 1952 appears to have been under al-Hawrani's influence. However, as the dictator grew more autocratic his influence waned, and when al-Shishakli decided to ban the Arab Socialist Party in April 1952, he went into exile in Lebanon. There, in November that year, he agreed to merge the Arab Socialist Party with the Arab Ba'ath Party led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The latter thus gained a substantial base of active supporters for the first time. The unified party adopted the name \"Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party\". It was disbanded, along with all Syrian political parties by president Nasser in 1958. The relation between Al-Hourani and Aflaq ended acrimoniously in 1962.\n\nAl-Hourani was a member of the Ba'ath Party national command, meaning its pan-Arab leadership, from its establishment in 1954 until 1959. Along with the other Ba'athists and members of most of Syria's political forces, he played a prominent role in the agitation and political mobilization that forced al-Shishakli to give up power in early 1954. He was speaker of the Syrian parliament from 1957 to February 1958, where this period is considered part of the golden era of Syrian democracy. In that position, Al-Hourani was able to influence the introduction of substantial social and economical progressive reforms.\nAfter the treaty of union between Syria and Egypt in 1958 Al-Hourani became Vice-President of the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Gamal Abdel Nasser, a post he held until 1959. After Nasser launched a bitter verbal attack on the Ba'ath Party in December that year, followed by a campaign of repression against its members, he resigned his position and went into exile in Lebanon. He subsequently differed with Aflaq and al-Bitar over the party's position regarding the UAR, due to his support for secession from the UAR.\n\nWhen a 1961 military coup in Syria led to the dissolution of the UAR, Al-Hourani publicly supported it and signed a statement in favor of the secession (as did Bitar, but he later withdrew his signature). The Ba'ath Party split into several competing factions, but as the national command decided in favour of reunification, Al-Hourani left it. He was officially expelled in June 1962, whereafter he and his loyalists re-established the Arab Socialist Party. However, popular support for unity hampered its growth and it was strong only in his original stronghold of Hama. In September 1962 he joined the \"secessionist\" (\"infisali\") cabinet formed by Khalid al-Azm, drawing strong criticism from the Ba'athist and Nasserist movements.\n\nAfter the Ba'athist/Nasserist-led pro-reunification coup of March 1963, Al-Hourani went into exile in Lebanon. As a radical military-backed Ba'ath faction purged other political groups in Syria, he was decided to remain in opposition outside the country, and would never return. His position against military coups is based on his strong belief in declamatory. The Arab Socialist Party split into competing factions, some of which aligned with the Ba'ath, some of which opposed it, but Hawrani's own influence dwindled. He spent the rest of his life between Lebanon, Iraq, France and Jordan, where he died in 1996. Al-Hourani was an important name in Syrian history but by the time of his death he had little or no influence at all over modern politics. His memoirs were published posthumously in Cairo in 2000.\n\n"}

His work on Iraq is widely considered the pre-eminent study of modern Iraqi history.\n\nBorn in Jerusalem in 1926, Hanna Batatu emigrated to the United States in 1948, the year of the Nakba - a series of events surrounding the establishment of the state of Israel in most of (what had previously been) British Mandate Palestine, as well as the creation of a large Palestinian refugee population barred by the new state from returning to their homes. From 1951 to 1953, he studied at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. He gained his doctorate at political science in Harvard University in 1960, with a dissertation entitled \" The Shaykh and the Peasant in Iraq, 1917-1958\". From 1962 to 1982 he taught at the American University of Beirut, then from 1982 until his retirement in 1994 at Georgetown University in the United States.\n\nBatatu started studying Iraqi history in the 1950s, taking a particular interest in the revolutionary movements which were then prominent in that country and especially in the Iraqi Communist Party. From the late 1950s on he travelled to Iraq several times, and succeeded in having access to communist political prisoners and secret police files before the revolution of 1958. He was allowed access to security service archives from various periods of Iraqi history, up until the 1970s, and used this and his considerable range of personal contacts with figures from different political movements to compose his study of political change in Iraq, \"The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq\" (published in 1978). This work, although largely focusing on the Iraqi Communist Party, also provides a wealth of information about the other revolutionary movements in the country as well as the ruling classes prior to 1958, and is considered one of the fundamental works on modern Iraqi history. Batatu's methodology is grounded in political sociology and considers in detail the social factors for the developments he covers, and even more so the social composition of the movements in question.\n\nBatatu also undertook a similar study of Syria, \"Syria's Peasantry, the Descendants of Its Lesser Rural Notables, and Their Politics\" (published in 1999).\n\n"}

He was a student of piano with Margerita Trombini-Kazuro and composition with both Kazimierz Sikorski and Jan Maklakiewicz; the latter he considered his spiritual father. Magin also studied violin, cello and ballet. In 1957, he completed his piano, compositional and conducting studies, graduating the Warsaw Higher School of Music with distinction.\n\nMiłosz Magin won prizes in several top international competitions: the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition in Paris and the Vianna da Motta Competition in Lisbon. He left his native country together with his wife Idalia Magin and stayed in Portugal, Germany, and England until finally settling in Paris in 1960. \n\nMagin's career as an international soloist was suddenly interrupted in 1963 after his left wrist was broken in a car accident. However, with a remarkable courage he eventually regained his playing abilities, and in 1968 started recording the complete works of Chopin for Decca, which is now regarded as a reference recording (complete reissue on CD was made by Universal in 2000). \n\nOther recordings: Chopin, Four Ballades, IPG (Societe francaise du son) 1973 Long Playing Record.\n\nDuring his years of recovery Magin went back to composition, which became one of his main priorities for the rest of his life. A prodigious piano virtuoso, he regularly gave concerts in different countries around the world, mainly performing works by Chopin, his favorite composer, but also works by Mozart and various Polish, French and Russian composers, as well as his own music.\n\nIn parallel to his career as a pianist and composer, Miłosz Magin became a popular teacher with students who came to him from all over the world, including such famous performers as Jean-Marc Luisada. According to his students, Magin was an exceptional master, not only sharing his knowledge but having the gift to inspire and tactfully advise while demanding high standards of his students.\n\nHe left a considerable body of music: piano works, including four sonatas and collections for young pianists, several concertos (four for piano, two for violin, one of each for cello and clarinet ), two symphonies, and a ballet, as well as vocal and orchestral works. Not attached to any particular musical style, Miłosz Magin’s music is notable for its balance between melody, harmony and rhythmic play. He was often inspired by the rhythms of his native Poland. Appreciated by the public, his works are now recorded and published as well as featured in the repertory of great performers.\n\nWith the help of his wife Idalia, also a pianist, in 1985 Magin founded the Miłosz Magin International Piano Competition in Paris. Devoted to the discovery of young international talents and to the promotion of Polish music, this competition takes place every two years with increasing popularity.\n\nMagin died on 4 March 1999 of a heart attack while touring with concerts in Tahiti. He was buried next to Chopin’s tomb at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, France. Miłosz Magin is considered one of the greatest Polish composers of the 20th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "2299675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299675", "title": "Torpedo ram", "text": "Torpedo ram\n\nA torpedo ram is a type of torpedo boat combining a ram with torpedo tubes. Incorporating design elements from the cruiser and the monitor, it was intended to provide small and inexpensive weapon systems for coastal defence and other littoral combat.\n\nLike a monitor, torpedo rams operated with very little freeboard, sometimes with only inches of hull rising above the water, exposing only their funnels and turrets to enemy fire. In addition to the guns in their turrets, they also were equipped with torpedoes. Early designs incorporated a spar torpedo that could be extended from the bow and detonated by ramming a target. Later designs used tube-launched self-propelled torpedoes, but retained the concept of ramming, resulting in designs like HMS \"Polyphemus\", which had five torpedo tubes, two each port and starboard and one mounted in the center of her reinforced ram bow.\n\nThe torpedo ram concept came about at a time when the self-propelled torpedo, pioneered by Robert Whitehead, had only just been invented. The earliest self-propelled torpedoes were obviously very powerful weapons, but were very short-ranged and incapable of reaching speeds greater than 10 knots, making them useless against anything but stationary targets. Another result of this was that for a time there was much confusion in naval circles about how best to employ the torpedo. During the 1870s a large number of proposals emerged for torpedo-carrying warships.\n\nThe torpedo ram, like most of the early torpedo-carrying warship designs, was intended to attack enemy warships while they were still at anchor in harbor. The torpedo ram's low profile and high speed were to make discovery and interception harder, as was the commonly stated intent for their attacks to take place at night. Once it reached the harbor, the torpedo ram was to smash its way through any seaward harbor defenses and make straight for the ships lying at anchor, firing its torpedoes before they could get underway. Once this was done, the torpedo ram would exit the harbor and make a high-speed escape to waiting friendly forces.\n\nIt soon became clear that the proposition of attacking enemy ships in harbors was not a practical one. Because of this, torpedo rams were never particularly popular, and the design was largely abandoned by the end of the 19th century as other, more practical, classes of torpedo-carrying warships emerged. Only a handful were built. The best remembered examples of the type were the aforementioned \"Polyphemus\" and the United States Navy's USS \"Intrepid\". Neither saw a great deal of active service and they were mostly used for torpedo trials, although \"Polyphemus\" did demonstrate the potential damage she could inflict when she was used to demolish a harbor defense boom via ramming.\n\nWhile never popular with the naval services that created them, the torpedo ram can be said to have caught public attention in a manner which far exceeded its utility as a concept for a fighting ship. The heroic HMS \"Thunder Child\" in H. G. Wells's science fiction novel classic \"The War of the Worlds\" was a torpedo ram, and she destroyed two Martian Tripods before being sunk by a Martian Heat Ray.\n\n"}

From the time of its first organization as a village, on February 7, 1781, until its incorporation as a city, it was governed by a board of trustees. At the time when its growth and commercial importance demanded the change of its government, it was chartered by the state legislature into a city of five wards and placed under the government of a mayor and city council, the latter being composed of ten members, two from each ward.\n\nThe first election under the Act of Incorporation took place in March 1828. All free white males who had lived in the city for at least six months prior to the election could vote, although mayors were not elected directly initially. The two top vote-getters were referred to the Governor, who selected the mayor from the two, with senate approval. The early mayor was relatively weak, acting mostly as a Justice of the Peace, serving a one-year term, and lacking a vote on the City Council except to break ties.\n\nA change to the charter in 1838 allowed for direct election of a mayor, extended the term to three years, and prevented incumbents from running for re-election. The term was reduced to two years from 1851 to 1870, then returned to three, and was finally set at four years by the Kentucky Legislature in 1894. In the early 20th century, corruption and political machines were rampant, causing mayors of both parties to be removed from office by courts. All legislative power was given to the Board of Aldermen in 1929. Mayoral term limits were set at three in 1986.\n\nOn January 6, 2003, the city of Louisville and Jefferson County governments merged to form the government of Louisville Metro, and the office of \"Mayor of Louisville Metro\" was created.\n\n\n"}

It does not include farm workers, private household employees, or non-profit organization employees.\n\nIt is an influential statistic and economic indicator released monthly by the United States Department of Labor as part of a comprehensive report on the state of the labor market.\n\nThe financial assets most affected by the nonfarm payroll (NFP) data include the US dollar, equities and gold. The markets react very quickly and most of the time in a very volatile fashion around the time the NFP data is released. The short-term market moves indicate that there is a very strong correlation between the NFP data and the strength of the US dollar. Historical price movement data shows a small negative correlation between the NFP data and the US dollar Index.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics releases preliminary data on the third Friday after the conclusion of the reference week, i.e., the week which includes the 12th of the month, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time; typically this date occurs on the first Friday of the month. Nonfarm payroll is included in the monthly \"Employment Situation\" or informally the \"jobs report\" and affects the US dollar, the Foreign exchange market, the bond market, and the stock market.\n\nThe figure released is the change in nonfarm payrolls (NFP), compared to the previous month, and is usually between +10,000 and +250,000 during non-recessional times. That number is meant to represent the number of jobs added or lost in the economy over the last month, not including jobs relating to the farming industry.\n\nIn general, increases in employment means both that businesses are hiring which means they are growing and that the newly-employed people have money to spend on goods and services, which further fuels growth. The opposite is true for decreases in employment.\n\nUS employment data showed sustained weakness throughout 2011. The jobs market has become an area of key focus for investors and market participants since US Federal Reserve ties monetary policies with economic performance, such as the size of quantitative easing programme. For this reason and in this environment the market is particularly sensitive to significant NFP releases.\n\nWhile the overall number of jobs added or lost in the economy is obviously an important current indicator of what the economic situation is, the report also includes several other pieces of data that can move financial markets:\n\n1. What the unemployment rate is in the economy as a percentage of the overall workforce. This is an important part of the report as the number of people out of work is a good indication of the overall health of the economy, and this is a number that is watched by the Fed as when it becomes low (generally anything below 5%) inflation is expected to start to creep up as businesses have to pay up to hire good workers and increase prices as a result. This initial rise in prices may mean that workers demand higher wages (especially as the economy reaches full employment) causing further inflation. In macroeconomics, this is known as the price/wage spiral.\n\n2. Which sectors the increase or decrease in jobs came from. This can give traders a heads up on which sectors of the economy may be primed for growth as companies in those sectors such as housing add jobs.\n\n3. Average hourly earnings. This is an important component because if the same number of people are employed but are earning more or less money for that work, this has basically the same effect as if people had been added or subtracted from the labor force.\n\n4. Revisions of previous nonfarm payrolls releases. An important component of the report which can move markets as traders re-price growth expectations based on the revision to the previous number.\n\n\n"}

It used to be the home arena of the Monterrey Fury indoor soccer team and the Fuerza Regia, a professional basketball team in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional; the Monterrey La Raza, a team in the NISL; and the Monterrey Steel, an indoor American football team in the National Arena League.\n\nThe Arena Monterrey is owned by Publimax S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca Northeast), part of the Avalanz Group, who owns 80% and by TV Azteca who owns 20%. The arena is 45,000 m (480,000 square feet) in size.\n\nThe project of the arena started in 1989 when the Asociación para el Fomento de Deporte y Recreación A.C, led by the businessmen Jorge Lankenau and Hernan Garza presented the project to the then president Carlos Salinas. The project gained support from the Government of the State of Nuevo León who gave the land for the arena to be constructed within the limits of Fundidora Park.\n\nThe arena was originally planned to begin construction in May 1992, and finished by 1993, but the construction actually started on January 1994, and was planned to be finished by 1996. However, due the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, on May 1995 the project suffered a slowdown in the construction industry and finally came to a complete halt by 1996, due the lack of economic resources.\n\nIn April 2001, the Government of the State of Nuevo León invited 11 groups of investors to discuss the possibilities of restarting the construction of the arena. On June 1, 2001 the government announced that there were only five groups of investors willing to take over the debt and finish up the project and 2 weeks later, Publimax S.A. de C.V. was announced winner of the contest because it was the group with the most money eager to invest in the project (50 million USD).\nBefore the construction was restarted, Hernán Garza accused the government of illegally revoking the concession that was given to him to build and finish the project. The government revoked the concession because of the halt of the project in 1995, but Garza alleged that the economic crisis obliged him to stop it for some time. This, among other problems such as the government delay in giving full control of the arena and Publimax rejecting any investment until control was fully given (which happened in July 2002), caused the project to restart by the end of 2002 with an estimated finish date by the first trimester of 2004.\n\nHowever, by the last trimester of 2003 the project was almost completed and the first event in the arena took place on Thursday November 27, 2003, with a concert performed by Mexican singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked variously with N-Trance, The Time Frequency, Belinda Carlisle, Ice MC, Scooter, Mary Kiani and DJ Dado.\n\nHis multi-award-winning dance music show, \"Steppin' Out\", started in 1985 and ran for fourteen years on Radio Forth, Forth RFM and Forth FM. Although the show was only broadcast to East and Central Scotland, tapes of the show were sent all over the world, hence the reason there were requests from listeners in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. Due to the success of his show and the Scottish dance music boom, Wilson's \"Bonus Beats\" programme aired on Forth FM during the mid-1990s. This allowed many local DJs the opportunity to provide one-hour mixes, spawning the growth of Tartan techno.\n\nIn 1972, Wilson started his broadcasting career in pirate radio on such stations as Radio Caroline Scotland and Radio Telstar. Later in 1984, he began answering phones for the \"Transistor Boogie\" show presented by Graham Jackson. From 1985 the first of what turned out to be Wilson's dance music shows on Forth FM came to air across East and Central Scotland. For fifteen years through the mid-1980s and into the 1990s, he presented \"Steppin' Out\", which went on to win several awards.\n\nAs well as being a radio presenter, he was also a record producer and achieved some considerable chart success with ten singles, one of which \"Technocat\" reached the Top 40 in the UK. He was responsible for the \"Bouncing Beats\" compilation releases, and also spent time remixing material for N-Trance and Belinda Carlisle.\n\nHaving spent some time working at other Scottish radio stations, he returned to Radio Forth in 2003 as the station's Head of Music for both FM (Forth 1) and AM (Forth 2) stations, and hosted two shows per week, including \"Old Skool\". In addition, away from music, Wilson was a fan of Heart of Midlothian F.C.\n\nWilson was also a nightclub DJ, appearing across the country at numerous clubs and events such as Awesome 101, Fantazia, Rezerection and The Fubar. He also became a record producer, producing \"Technocat\" which, billed as Technocat featuring Tom Wilson, became a Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted in several European countries. In addition his track, \"Let Your Body Go\", spent one week at #60 in the UK chart in March 1996. Wilson also put together several compilation albums, namely the \"Bouncin' Back\" and \"Bouncin' Beats\" series. After a brief spell working at several other Scottish radio stations, including Beat 106 and Real Radio, Wilson rejoined Radio Forth in 2003 as head of music for both Forth One and Forth 2, and hosted two weekly shows including the \"Old Skool\" show on a Sunday evening.\n\nWilson was popular on the club circuit, attending many prominent dance music events including 1992's SECC based 'Big Bang' event. The 1990s saw Wilson headlining the biggest dance festivals across Scotland, such as Livingston Forum's Awesome 101 and Ingliston's Rezerection.\n\nRadio Forth announced the death of Tom Wilson - father of four children; Lynsey, Stephanie, Craig and Allex- on 25 March 2004, at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital following a heart attack, and a short period of illness.\n\nHis memorial service was held on 31 March 2004.

{"id": "2299711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299711", "title": "Threefold Model", "text": "Threefold Model\n\nThe Threefold Model or GDS theory of roleplaying games is an attempt to distinguish three different goals in roleplaying. In its original formation, these are: Drama, Simulation, and Game. It was the inspiration for subsequent theories, such as the GNS Theory, which retained a 3-way division but altered other aspects of the model.\n\nIn its most formal sense, the threefold model claims that any single gamemaster (GM) decision (about the resolution of in-game events) can be made in order to further the goals of Drama, or Simulation, or Game. By extension, a series of decisions may be described as tending towards one or two of the three goals, to a greater or lesser extent. This can be visualised as an equilateral triangle, with a goal at each vertex, and the points between them representing different weightings of the different goals. As a consequence, a player or GM can characterise their preferred gaming style as a point on this triangle, or (since no real precision is implied) in words such as 'mostly gamist' or 'dramatist with a bit of simulationist' or 'right in the middle'.\n\nAnother consequence of the model is the claim that by advancing towards one of the goals, one is moving away from the other two. Thus a game that is highly dramatic will be neither a good simulation nor a challenging game, and so on. This assertion has been widely challenged, and led to criticism of the model.\n\nIn the terminology of the threefold, the goals of drama, simulation and game have specific meanings.\n\n\nThe Threefold Model was widely discussed in the rec.games.frp.advocacy USENET group in the summer of 1997. Mary Kuhner had laid out many of the central ideas there and John H. Kim had later codified and expanded the discussion. The threefold arose following long arguments and flame-wars about whether one style of roleplaying was 'better' than another style. The name was coined by Kuhner, in a July 1997 post which outlined the principles. In October 1998, a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" (FAQ) document by Kim on the Threefold Model clearly stated, \"An important part of the model is recognising that there are valid different goals for gaming.\" It has since then been circulated in a variety of places. It was also the inspiration for a related model known as \"GNS Theory\", which has been articulated by Ron Edwards on the roleplaying discussion site The Forge.\n\n"}

When Noriega took refuge in the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See (diplomatic quarter), deafening music and other psychological warfare tactics were used to convince him to exit and surrender himself.\n\nThe United States claimed that after ten days of psychological harassment, the Papal Nuncio (ambassador) Monsignor Laboa had threatened to revoke Noriega's sanctuary if he didn't surrender to the United States, although Laboa insisted that he had made no threats of revoking the right of asylum under the Church, but had used his own \"precisely calibrated psychological campaign\" to force Noriega's departure.\n\nAlthough the operation was successful, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft would later point to the psychological harassment of the Papal Nuncio as \"a low moment in US Army history,\" noting that their approach had been silly, reproachable and undignified.\n\nLaunched in the starting hours of Operation Just Cause, this operation was handled by SEAL Team 4. Consisting of 48 U.S. Navy SEALs (three SEAL Platoons; Golf, Echo, and Delta) under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Toohey (executive officer of Team 4 and former SEAL Team SIX officer), this team was tasked with destroying Noriega's private jet on the ground at the Punta Paitilla Airport, a coastal airport in Panama City. The main force of SEALs landed just south of the airport at approximately 0030, shortly before the initial combat operations started within Panama City itself. Several reconnaissance teams were hidden on the north side of the airfield to provide real-time data on enemy movements. Once the SEALs landed, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey established a command post near the southern edge of the runway. At this time Cmdr. McGrath, a SEAL officer stationed on a patrol boat offshore coordinating several operations, passed on information implying that the aircraft was to be disabled with “minimal damage” (defined as shot out tires and cut control wires), rather than destroyed. This later became a point of controversy after the operation, as the message was poorly worded and forced the SEALs to change their tactics at the last minute and approach the aircraft more closely than anticipated.\n\nThe three platoons then began advancing up the airfield, with Golf platoon taking up final assaulting positions outside the hangar at roughly 0105. At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey received a message stating that PDF V300 Cadillac Gage armored cars were heading towards the airport. To counter the threat, a squad (Squad One of Golf Platoon) was ordered to move into ambush positions on a nearby road. As they stood up to move, the PDF soldiers stationed in the airfield immediately opened fire, killing one SEAL and wounding five others. The other two platoons moved to reinforce Golf, and within several minutes had secured the hangars, with two more SEALs killed and four more wounded. The SEALs then disabled Noriega's private plane by shooting it with an AT4 rocket. Shortly after, a MEDEVAC helicopter arrived and transported the injured SEALs to the Joint Casualty Collection Point at Howard Air Force Base. The SEALs held the area throughout the night, and disabled the runway for use by any PDF transport planes by rolling other aircraft onto it. The next day, the SEALs were replaced by a company from the 75th Ranger Regiment. Due to the high level of casualties sustained and several inconsistencies regarding planning and command and control during the battle, the Battle of Paitilla Airport is considered one of the most controversial operations within Operation JUST CAUSE from the US military perspective.\n\nDuring the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group from SEAL Team TWO, consisting of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, was assigned to conduct a combat swimmer attack and sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, \"Presidente Porras\", while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives on the bottom of the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an insertion point located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred fifty yards away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs went off, and were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were heading back to the rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base.\n\nOn the fifth day of the American invasion, Noriega phoned Monsignor Laboa at the Apostolic Nunciature and explained he would appreciate being able to seek sanctuary within; noting that he would otherwise have to flee to the countryside and wage a guerrilla war. Given only ten minutes to decide, Laboa said he did not confer with the Vatican, but agreed to allow Noriega to enter the Nunciature grounds — although from the very start, he confessed that he deceived Noriega, noting that he believed that Panamanian politics necessitated that his own role be to convince Noriega to surrender to the American army, not to grant him asylum within Vatican territory. Laboa later confided he was \"surprised and dismayed\" that Noriega would choose to seek refuge with the Church.\n\nNoriega fled to the Apostolic Nunciature, the de facto embassy of the Holy See, and took refuge there with four others, Lieut. Colonel Nivaldo Madrinan, head of Panama's secret police; Captain Eliecer Gaitan, who led the special force charged with protecting Noriega; Belgica de Castillo, the former head of the immigration department, and her husband Carlos Castillo. He turned over the majority of his weapons, and requested sanctuary within. He spent his time in a \"stark\" room with no air conditioning or television, reading the Bible for the duration of his stay.\n\nAmerican soldiers set up a perimeter outside this building, as any direct action against the embassy itself would have violated international diplomatic law.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State James Baker wrote to the Vatican, insisting that \"this is an exception to diplomatic immunity. We've indicted him as a drug dealer...you must understand that having lost American lives to restore democracy in Panama, we cannot allow Noriega to go to any other country than the United States.\"\n\nJoaquin Navarro-Valls, speaking on behalf of the Vatican, clarified that the strong messages left by American diplomats and military leaders would not be obeyed and Noriega would not be turned over. Navarro-Valls clarified that Pope John Paul II had not spoken on the issue except to lament the deaths caused by \"absurd imprudence.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army turned to psychological warfare, blaring rock music at \"deafening levels,\" gunning the engines of armored vehicles against the Nunciature's fence, and setting fire to a neighboring field and bulldozing it to create a \"helicopter landing zone.\" Reportedly the version of the song \"I Fought The Law\" performed by The Clash was played repeatedly along with \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" by AC/DC and \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses; another song in the line-up was \"Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die\" by Jethro Tull.\n\nOn December 27, the psychological warfare was turned over to the control of the 4th Psychological Operations Group of Special Operations Command. The Holy See complained to President George H. W. Bush about actions of the American soldiers surrounding the embassy, and after three days, the rock music was stopped.\n\nOn December 30, the Vatican clarified that it did not believe Noriega had asylum, \"but [was] a person in refuge.\" Meanwhile, Monsignor Laboa petitioned both Panama and the Vatican to agree to extend the embassy property to include another building where he had Noriega's four companions moved to prevent them from encouraging Noriega to stay under Vatican sanctuary, allowing him to convince Noriega to leave. A friend of Laboa later told the UPI that Laboa wanted to \"go to work on Noriega, weave a sort of spell around him until he gives in\".\n\nAfter ten days of demoralization, Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa told Noriega that he had no choice but to surrender to the American soldiers at the front gate. \"Time\" magazine later noted that Monsignor Laboa was not entirely honest with Noriega, falsely telling him that no country in the world was willing to grant him refuge. Monsignor Laboa had also written to the US Army, granting his permission for them to storm the property if they believed his life was in danger. Eventually, Monsignor Laboa said that if Noriega did not surrender to the Americans, the Papal staff would evacuate the building, move into a Catholic high school and declare it the new embassy — leaving Noriega alone in the abandoned building to face the Americans without any benefit of Vatican sanctuary.\n\nNoriega asked permission to phone his wife and three daughters, who had taken refuge in the Cuban embassy; he ensured they would be flown to exile in the Dominican Republic if he surrendered.\n\nOn January 3, Noriega attended Holy Mass in the Nuncio's chapel and took communion; where Laboa's homily was about the thief on the cross who in one moment asked God to change his life, and reportedly brought tears to Noriega's eyes.\n\nAfter Mass, Noriega retired to his room where he wrote two letters, one to his wife informing her \"I go now on an adventure,\" and the other thanking the Pope and stressing that he believed himself innocent and that he had always acted in the best interests of the Panamanian people and requesting the Pope's prayers.\n\nNoriega dressed in his tan uniform, receiving permission to bring the Nuncio's Bible with him, and went outside into the dark night with three priests who walked with him the fifty paces to the front gate; when he reached the front gate, an American paratrooper named Sgt. Scott Geist lunged at Noriega, described as \"a broken man,\" and a number of other soldiers also tackled him to the ground and began searching his effects. His wrists were taped behind his back and he was bundled into a waiting American helicopter which took him to Howard Air Force Base.\n\nMonsignor Laboa later told the press that he was proud at having \"outwitted\" Noriega and convincing him to surrender himself to the Americans, noting \"I'm better at psychology.\"\n"}

Upon graduation, he began his education in research at the Lister Institute in London, England.\n\nIn 1957 he joined the newly formed Ontario Cancer Institute where the majority of his research focused on normal blood-formation and leukaemia. Together with his colleague, Dr. J.E. Till, McCulloch created the first quantitative, clonal method to identify stem cells and used this technique for pioneering studies on stem cells. His experience in hematology, when combined with Till's experience in biophysics, yielded a novel and productive combination of skills and interests.\n\nIn the early 1960s, McCulloch and Till started a series of experiments that involved injecting bone marrow cells into irradiated mice. Visible nodules were observed in the spleens of the mice, in proportion to the number of bone marrow cells injected. Till and McCulloch called the nodules 'spleen colonies', and speculated that each nodule arose from a single marrow cell: perhaps a stem cell.\n\nIn later work, Till and McCulloch were joined by graduate student Andy Becker, and demonstrated that each nodule did indeed arise from a single cell. They published their results in \"Nature\" in 1963.

The natural harbour that makes up the town is located on the east side of Trinity Bay and it is built along the northeast side and the southeast base of this harbour.\n\nThe first references to Heart's Content came from John Guy's journal of his voyage into Trinity Bay in 1612. Through much of the 17th century, Heart's Content was used by migratory fisherman from England. The area was permanently settled by at least 1677.\n\nLike many other Newfoundland English settlements, this small village was a victim to the French army of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1697. During King William's War, this village was raided in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign.\n\nHeart's Content was given its place in the history of international communications by Cyrus West Field who chose it as the terminus of his Transatlantic telegraph cable, leading to establishment of the Heart's Content Cable Station. In July 1866, when the cable was brought ashore, it was described as \"a sheltered nook, where ships may ride at anchor safe from the storms of the ocean…on the beach is a small village of sixty houses, most of them the dwelling of these hardy men who vex the northern sea with their fisheries…\"\n\nHeart's Content did not depend on the cable industry alone for its economically successful standing. Besides the growing importance of the Labrador fishery and the seal hunt, as well as the shipbuilding industry, other economic stimuli made it a growing and prosperous community. Transportation connections between Heart's Content and the rest of the Avalon Peninsula improved and greatly accommodated the movement of people and goods, and the overall production of business improved the town and other areas of Trinity and Conception Bays.\n\nWithin 10 years of incorporation Heart's Content obtained most of the facilities and the amenities of a small town. These included a town hall, fire station, a municipal park, water and sewage system, a ballpark and a senior citizens club.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town contains a large natural harbour opening out to Trinity Bay in a generally southwestern direction and protected from the harsh northern and eastern winds of the North Atlantic.\n\nHeart's Content is also at the crossroads of the main highway for Trinity Bay on the western side of the Bay de Verde peninsula and the highway cutting across the Bay de Verde peninsula between Victoria on the Conception Bay side and Heart's Content.\n\nHeart's Content and surrounding areas are dotted by small fishing communities that were established due the proximity of each community to the fishing grounds.

He was responsible for the first major phylogenetic ordering of bird groups based on a large scale study on a combination of skeletal, morphological and anatomical characteristics.\n\nMax was the first son of Karl Fürbringer, and Hermine. Although he was born in Wittenberg, his father's work in the government involved travel and he was raised by relatives in Gera. Max was taught and influenced by Karl Theodor Liebe, a bird enthusiast who kept many kinds of birds. Max spent his early childhood collecting butterflies, bees, mosses and ferns. He was also interested in coins. Max's brother Paul would later become an eminent physicist. Max studied at the universities of Berlin and Jena, where he was a student of Karl Gegenbaur. Fürbringer would be one of Gegenbaur's most ardent disciples and supporters. One of Fürbringer teachers was Ernst Haeckel about whom he wrote glowingly:\n\"\"He stepped into the auditorium, not with the measured step of the professor, but with the triumphant charging-along of an Apollonian youth, hurrying toward the cathedra, a tall, slender, impressive form; ... golden, flying locks, large, blue, flashing eyes—probably the most beautiful man that I had ever seen, and it seemed to me as if the room, which had already been bright, became noticeably brighter...\"\"\nHe obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the muscles and bones of dinosaurs. He later worked as a prosector under Gegenbaur at the University of Heidelberg, followed by professorships in Amsterdam, Jena (from 1888) and Heidelberg (from 1901). In 1901 he replaced Gegenbaur at Heidelberg as professor and stayed on until 1912 when his student (and later son-in-law) Hermann Braus took over. He then served as an \"außerordentliche\" (=extraordinary) professor at the University of Marburg.\n\nIn 1888 Fürbringer published a two volume work on the systematics of birds groups. The first volume was on the forelimbs and shoulder girdle of vertebrates while the second examined the characters and systematics of bird groups. One of the ideas that he used was that the connection of the nerve to a muscle tends to be conserved with evolution. He made use of 51 anatomical and morphological characters and compared every pair of bird group and deduced an evolutionary tree of all the extant and extinct bird groups. His evolutionary tree branched in three dimensions which he represented by means of side and cross-sectional views. This representation was probably influenced by the work of Adolf Engler on plants. This was a seminal work in bird systematics which underwent modifications by Hans Gadow and others to stay as a definitive work on the avian evolutionary tree until the arrival of molecular techniques.\n\nAs a defender of Gegenbaur Fürbringer went against Carl Rabl in 1901. This long drawn conflict involved polemical attacks on each other relating to the archipterygium or how the fin and the limb were related based on conflicting evidence from anatomy and embryology.\n\n\n"}

After slipping to a .292 average in 1939 while suffering two cases of the flu, he returned with All-Star seasons in 1940 and 1941, hitting .322 and .359 (second in the AL as Ted Williams batted .406). In the latter year Travis enjoyed his best overall season with career highs of 101 runs batted in, 106 runs scored, 39 doubles, 19 triples and 7 home runs, along with his league-best 218 hits, and finished sixth in the MVP vote.\n\nTravis entered the Army in the winter of 1941-42, and spent most of World War II in the United States, playing on military baseball teams. Sent to Europe in late 1944 while serving in the 76th Infantry Division, he suffered a severe case of frostbite during the Battle of the Bulge, necessitating an operation to prevent amputation of his feet. Travis received a Bronze Star for his military service. Although only 31 years old when he returned to baseball, he was not the same player as he had been before the war, and hit .241 in late 1945 and .252 in 1946. He retired after batting .216 in 74 games in . One month before his final game, he was honored with \"Cecil Travis Night\" at Griffith Stadium, with General Dwight D. Eisenhower in attendance.\n\nIn his career, Travis had 1544 hits, 665 runs, 657 RBI, 265 doubles, 78 triples, 27 home runs and 23 stolen bases in 1328 games. He was a Senators scout until 1956, and then returned to his family farm. He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. He died at his home in December 2006 at age 93.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Dell Loy Hansen, through Broadway Media LS, LLC. KUUU broadcasts R&B/Hip-Hop music. The station's studios are located in Downtown Salt Lake City and its transmitter site is located southwest of the city on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains.\n\nThe station was launched on September 1, 1979 and adopted its callsign KTLE on September 10. On May 19, 1982, it was modified to KTLE-FM. On May 9, 1997, it was slightly changed to KTKL and again to its current KUUU on March 8, 1999. The station's current Rhythmic Top 40 format began on February 27, 1999 at 92.1 FM and was licensed to Tooele, Utah. In February 2005, the station moved to its current dial position and changed its city-of-license to South Jordan, Utah, allowing them to better cover the Salt Lake Valley. The station was previously broadcasting to most of the valley via a low-power booster in the Oquirrh mountains.\n\nCurrent announcers include Poetik-C, Nikki Rae, DJ Erockalypze and Kev. Past hosts included N8 Smiff, Jay R, Zac Davis, Romeo on the Radio, Pat Clark after Dark, Jagger, Kevin Cruise, Ron T, Booker, JDub, Mark-E, & Tic-Tac.\n\nIn an article from \"The Salt Lake Tribune\", the station is cited by music trade publications and record labels for being influential in breaking songs from artists like Flo Rida, Plies and T-Pain, especially in a radio market like Salt Lake City. Program Director at the time Brian Michel says it is because the station is not owned by a major broadcaster, who would tell the hosts what they should play instead of what the listeners really want to hear: \"People in San Antonio aren't telling us what to play,\" he said. \"We have no outside consultants. We interact with [our listeners].\"\n\nOn June 18, 2010, KUUU, along with KUDD and KYLZ were sold the station to Simmons Media Group, who in turn sold the stations to Broadway Media in 2013. In 2016, KUUU initially applied to move from 92.5 to 92.3 and upgrade its signal coverage as part of a deal that Broadway made with Community Wireless, who moved KPCW-FM down from 91.9 to 91.7 and took ownership of KUDD that Broadway donated to them earlier, but then instead later applied to its wattage from 500 watts to 3,700 watts and decrease its HAAT from to , increasing its coverage area by approximately 15 miles in all directions.\n\nOn February 16, 2019 U92 celebrated 20 years on air. U92 had a show at Vivint Smart Home Arena in downtown Salt Lake City to a sold out crowd. With performances that featured The Luniz, Digital Underground, Ying Yang Twins, Zapp, Baby Bash, Too $hort and Ice Cube.\n\nIn 2008, KUUU became the subject of an upcoming reality television series, called \"The $tation.\" The series will follow KUUU, its airstaff and management, as they look at how the station has managed to succeed in a very conservative metropolitan radio market like Salt Lake City. Program Director Kevin Cruise and producer TJ Bates (\"The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency\" and \"Bridezillas\") are behind this project.

A large portion at the south end of the airport is located in the town of Nekimi. It is located adjacent to Pioneer Airport, part of the EAA Aviation Museum. The airport was named after pioneer air racer, aircraft designer and builder Steve Wittman in 1972. Originally named \"Winnebago County Airport\", the name \"Steve Wittman Field\" was proposed in 1968 and it is also known as Wittman Field. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023, in which it is categorized as a regional general aviation facility.\n\nIt has serviced aircraft as large as the Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Airbus A380, Concorde and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.\nThe airport has been served by commercial airlines in the past. Until 1980, Wittman boarded more passengers than nearby Appleton International Airport, and was the commercial air hub of the Fox Cities.\n\nWittman was served at various times by Wisconsin Central Airlines, North Central, Republic, Air Wisconsin, American Central, Midstate Airlines, Northwest Airlink, United Express, Midway Connection, Skyway, and Great Lakes. Service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program until March 2003, when it was terminated due to federal law not allowing a subsidy over $200 per passenger for communities located within 210 miles of the nearest large or medium hub airport (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, a medium hub serving Milwaukee).\n\nWittman Regional Airport covers an area of 1,392 acres (563 ha) at an elevation of 808 feet (246 m) above mean sea level. It has four runways: 18/36 is 8,002 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m); 9/27 is 6,179 by 150 feet (1,883 x 46 m); 5/23 is 3,697 by 75 feet (1,127 x 23 m); 13/31 is 3,061 by 75 feet (933 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2015, the airport had 64,717 aircraft operations, an average of 177 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% air taxi and 1% military, though the EAA Airventure airshow accounts for a large number of the annual operations. In July 2019, there were 171 aircraft based at this airport: 129 single-engine, 29 multi-engine, 12 jet and 1 helicopter.\n\nAs with many larger airports, Wittman Field's expansion over the years has necessitated the closure of nearby roadways and acquisition of nearby parcels of land. In particular, Knapp Street (running parallel to the runways) has been permanently closed near the airport to facilitate the expansion of the grounds in that area (for the annual EAA Airventure.)\n\nThe airport has 3 flight schools; Aviation Services, Discover Flight, and Fox Valley Technical College.\n\nThe original tower at Wittman Field opened in 1963. In 2007, a new tower was built that is over twice the height of the old building. The original tower was demolished in April 2009.\n\nFreight Runners Express offers scheduled cargo service from the airport. They utilize their Beechcraft Model 99 aircraft type for Oshkosh cargo operations.\n\nThe airport is the site of the annual Experimental Aircraft Association's AirVenture Oshkosh, an experimental aircraft and sport aviation airshow. Across Knapp St. to the west lies the campus of the EAA AirVenture Museum. For the week of AirVenture Oshkosh (known locally as \"The Airshow\" or \"The Fly-in\"), Wittman Regional is the world's busiest airport by traffic movements.\n\nThe airport will be implementing a two-phase project to improve drainage and rebuild Taxiway B. Work is expected to start after AirVenture 2016.\n\n"}

He seemed destined for distinction as a poet, his volume of \"Ludibria Lunae\" (1869) being followed in 1870 by the remarkably fine \"Paradise of Birds\". But a certain academic quality of mind seemed to check his output in verse and divert it into the field of criticism.\n\nApart from many contributions to the higher journalism, his literary career is associated mainly with his continuation of the edition of Pope's works, begun by Whitwell Elwin, which appeared in ten volumes from 1871-1889; his life of Addison (\"Men of Letters\" series, 1882); his \"Liberal Movement in English Literature\" (1885); and his tenure of the professorship of Poetry at Oxford (1895-1901), which resulted in his elaborate \"History of English Poetry\" (the first volume appearing in 1895), and his \"Life in Poetry\" (1901).\n\nHe deals with the history of English poetry as a whole, and in its unity as a result of the national spirit and thought in succeeding ages, and attempts to bring the great poets into relation with this. In 1887 he was appointed a civil service commissioner, being first commissioner in 1892, and being made a CB.

He played for NAC Breda, De Graafschap, Ipswich Town, Grays Athletic and Leiston.\n\nWilnis played for NAC Breda and De Graafschap before signing for Ipswich in 1999. The Dutchman joined the Blues from De Graafschap for £200,000 in January 1999, replacing Mauricio Taricco. Wilnis quickly established himself in the side and was a key part of George Burley's side which won promotion to the Premiership.\n\nWilnis scored a rare and memorable goal against Manchester United in the first home game after the return to the top flight. After Chris Makin's recruitment in 2001, Wilnis played fewer games and looked to be on his way out of the club after falling out with Burley after being substituted in the first half of the UEFA Cup tie at Helsingborg late in 2001.\n\nFormer Norwich striker Joe Royle's arrival as manager a year later saw Wilnis get his chance once more. He was a regular mainly at right-back but often at left-back and latterly at centre-half during the former England striker's tenure as manager. Wilnis scored the opening goal in the 2–0 win at Norwich City in 2003. Wilnis became one of the longest-serving players at the club. He was the supporters' Player of the Year for 2005–06.\n\nUnder Jim Magilton, Wilnis frequently found himself on the sidelines, but signed a new one-year contract in May 2007. The revival of form by Spanish defender Sito Castro and the strong partnership of Alex Bruce and Jason de Vos, made it hard for Wilnis to break back into the side. After Ipswich's final game of the 2007–08 season, Wilnis announced that he was to retire as a player, but was interested in coaching opportunities at Ipswich. Unfortunately he was told there were no vacancies at Portman Road at the time, which brought to an end a long association with the club. He was released by the club at the end of the 2007–08 season.\n\nIn August 2008, Wilnis signed for Grays Athletic on a one-year contract. He retired at the end of the 2008–09 season. Wilnis played his last game for Ipswich Town in his Testimonial game with Colchester United in 2009. A stunning own goal from Colchester defender Magnus Okuonghae and a strike from Jordan Rhodes gave the Blues a 2–0 victory. Fabian Wilnis made his final appearance in a Town shirt with 12 minutes left, his every touch applauded by the Blues supporters.

At the time, it was really frightening ... I upset and offended some of their fans and for that I really am sorry. I think the dust has settled now, though.

Paterson's strong fan support returned the Black Yankees to Paterson's Hinchliffe Stadium.\n\nThe team was founded in Harlem as the Harlem Black Bombers in 1931 by financier James \"Soldier Boy\" Semler and dancer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. By 1932 the team was named the Harlem Stars and by 1933 became the New York Black Yankees.\n\nThe team's left fielder Fats Jenkins was chosen by fans to play in the East team for the first East-West All-Star Game in 1933. A succession of other players were sent to the big game in 1937–1942, 1947 and 1948.\n\nThe team's schedule could be punishing. In the 1930s they played two doubleheaders 350 miles apart on successive days. They left Pittsburgh after the first two games at about 10:00 PM to cross the Allegheny Mountains for South Orange, New Jersey. One of the two cars broke down so nine of the 16 players crowded into the other car to ensure that play would start on time. They arrived just twenty minutes behind the scheduled start time. They were given five minutes to warm up. The other seven players arrived a few minutes later so they were able to lunch and sleep before taking two of their exhausted team mates to play the second game.

One week later, Ego made his singles debut in a losing effort to Mike Golden. After losing to Jailhouse Rocker on May 10, he picked up the first win of his career by defeating Kenny D on June 21.\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Parris returned to wrestling and began competing on the independent circuit, most prominently for the National Wrestling Alliance, as Air Paris. He debuted for the NWA on September 25, 1999, at their 51st anniversary show, and was unable to win a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Paris appeared at the following year's anniversary show on October 14, 2000, where he and Cassidy O'Reilly lost to Bad Attitude (David Young and Rick Michaels) in a match for the World Tag Team Championship. After debuting in the NWA territory Wildside in early 1999, he soon won the territory's Junior Heavyweight Championship on May 13. However, he was stripped of the title on October 28 after being unable to defend the title in 30 days due to an injury. Paris regained the title after defeating Andy Anderson on November 4, but was once again stripped of the title in May 2000. Paris would go on to win his first and only Television Championship after defeating Eddie Golden on January 6, 2001, but lost the title to A.J. Styles that same night.\n\nIn addition to Wildside, Paris began competing for Music City Wrestling and Main Event, two other NWA territories. While in MCW, he won the North American Championship. Meanwhile, in Main Event, he reformed his tag team with Cassidy O'Reilly and together, they won the North American Tag Team Championship on August 14, 1999. They later lost the title on November 27 to New South (Ashley Hudson and Cory Williams). Chase Stevens later replaced Paris in the tag team due to Paris signing a developmental deal with World Championship Wrestling in 2000. Despite being contracted to WCW, Paris returned to Main Event and won the North American Tag Team Title for the second time, this time with Big Bully Douglas, on April 14, 2000. They held the title until September of that year before it was vacated due to Paris and Douglas splitting.\n\nAfter being signed to a deal with World Championship Wrestling in 2000, Parris, under his Air Paris name, debuted for the promotion alongside former NWA Wildside rival A.J. Styles on the February 14, 2001, episode of \"Thunder\", where they lost to Evan Karagias and Jamie Noble. Paris and Styles gained their first and only win in WCW when they scored an upset against former World Tag Team Champions The Boogie Knights (Alex Wright and Disco Inferno) the following week on \"Thunder\". Paris and Styles made their \"Nitro\" debut on the March 5 episode, there they lost to Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo. On the final episode of \"Thunder\" on March 21, Styles was renamed to Air Styles and together the team was given the new name Air Raid as they went on to lose to The Jung Dragons. When WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation, neither Paris nor Styles had their contracts picked up by the WWF.\n\nAfter the closures of both WCW and NWA Wildside, Paris returned to competing on the Georgia independent circuit, and wrestled his final match in the Rings of Glory promotion on December 16, 2005. On May 1, 2008, he returned to wrestling under his Air Paris name and joined the promotion NAWA Ring Champions as a booker and wrestler.\n\nUpon debuting, Paris was given a match for any NAWA championship of his choosing by Commissioner Ted Guinness, but was subsequently attacked by The Exotic Ones (Simon Sermon and Rick Michaels), the promotion's Tag Team Champions. On May 15, Paris teamed with Cruiserweight Champion Chris Ganz to face The Exotic Ones for the Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful in winning the title. After the match, Paris turned on Ganz by utilizing the title match he received from Guinness and defeated Ganz to win the Cruiserweight Championship, resulting in Paris becoming a heel in the process.\n\nAfter vacating the Cruiserweight Title, Paris began feuding with Ganz and faced him on June 5 in a tag team match, but was unsuccessful as he and Jason Valentine lost to Ganz and Tommy Rich. On July 3, their feud culminated when Paris and Bobby Eaton were defeated by Ganz and Ricky Morton.\n\nIn 2009, Parris left NAWA Ring Champions and joined Purks International Championship Wrestling as a booker and wrestler. He made his in-ring debut for the promotion on December 16 as a heel, where he and Bobby Hayes lost to The Steiner Brothers.

On March 6, Paris wrestled against former tag team partner and then-TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles in a non-title match, which ended in a no-contest due to outside interference. Paris then continued his feud with Hayes and Young and defeated them in a tag team match with Kevin Nash as his partner on April 10. After the match, Hayes piledrove Paris before Young did the same, injuring him in the process.\n\nDespite being injured, Paris returned on June 12 during a triple threat match for the Heavyweight Championship between Hayes, Young and Chris Harris and helped Harris defeat Hayes and Young to win the Heavyweight Title. On February 12, 2011, Paris teamed with Terry Lawler to defeat Hayes and Young in a tag team match.\n\nIn 2013, Parris was announced as being one of the contributors to \"Phenomenal\", the autobiography of former tag team partner A.J.

This sense of the term \"reduction\" does not imply any sort of removal or quantitative decrease but rather implies a restoration: \"re\" (\"back [to initial position]\") + \"ducere\" (\"lead\"/\"bring\"), i.e., \"bringing back to normal\". When a bone fractures, the fragments lose their alignment in the form of displacement or angulation. For the fractured bone to heal without any deformity the bony fragments must be re-aligned to their normal anatomical position. Orthopedic surgery attempts to recreate the normal anatomy of the fractured bone by \"reduction\" of the displacement.\n\n\"Reduction\" could be by \"closed\" or \"open\" methods:\n\nBecause the process of reduction can briefly be intensely painful, it is commonly done under a short-acting anesthetic, sedative, or nerve block. Once the fragments are reduced, the \"reduction\" is maintained by application of casts, traction, or held by plates, screws, or other implants, which may in turn be external or internal. It is very important to verify the accuracy of reduction by clinical tests and X-ray, especially in the case of joint dislocations.\n\n"}

Another notable role was as Michael O'Sullivan in \"Waking Ned\".\n\nKelly was born 11 July 1929 in Dublin, Ireland, and educated at Dublin's Synge Street CBS Christian Brothers school. He began acting at the age of eight at the city's Gaiety Theatre, and trained at The Abbey School of Acting. As a backup career, he additionally trained as a draughtsman and calligrapher, and also learned watercolour art. He appeared onstage in the original production of Brendan Behan's \"The Quare Fellow\", and gained his first major career attention in Samuel Beckett's \"Krapp's Last Tape\" at the Dublin's Abbey Theatre in 1959. By then he had made his screen debut in a small part in director John Pomeroy's 1958 film noir \"Dublin Nightmare\".\n\nOne of his first television appearances was on RTE in \"O'Dea's your Man\" (1964) in which he played the part of Ignatius opposite Jimmy O'Dea. He went on to become a familiar face on British television with the BBC comedy \"Me Mammy\", opposite Milo O'Shea and Anna Manahan. He went on to often-memorable guest roles on such series as \"Oh Father!\", \"Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width\", and \"On the Buses\", and particularly during the 1970s with a long-running role as the one-armed dishwasher Albert Riddle in the \"Man About the House\" spin-off \"Robin's Nest\". He also had a regular long running role alongside Bruce Forsyth in both series of the comedy \"Slingers Day\" from 1986 to 1987.\n\nHe gained some of his greatest recognition in 1975, playing inept builder Mr O'Reilly on the second episode of \"Fawlty Towers\" (\"The Builders\").\n\nKelly was in the voice cast of \"The Light Princess\", a partly animated, hour-long family fantasy that aired on the BBC in 1978.\n\nIn Ireland, he may be most famous for his portrayal of the character \"Rashers\" Tierney in the 1980 RTÉ miniseries \"Strumpet City\", which starred Peter O'Toole, Cyril Cusack and Peter Ustinov.

He played title character Frank Kovak in the mystery film \"The Kovak Box\", in a rare villainous role. In 2007, he appeared in \"Stardust\", which featured Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, and which was also his final film. He also did extensive radio work, including a guest appearance on the BBC Radio 4 series \"Baldi\". \n\nKelly was married to actress Laurie Morton, who survived him, along with children David and Miriam. He died after a short illness on 12 February 2012 at age 82. \"The Irish Times\" referred to him as the \"grand old man of Irish acting\". A Catholic funeral mass took place on 16 February 2012, at the Church of the Miraculous Medal, in the actor's home town of Dublin. Kelly was cremated at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium.\n\nKelly won a 1991 Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Supporting Performer, Non-Resident Production, for a Kennedy Center revival of \"The Playboy of the Western World\".

He was born in the Cumberland Valley, near Shippensburg, Franklin County, Pennsylvania. He was the father of noted sculptor and poet Blanche Nevin.\n\nHe was a nephew of Hugh Williamson of North Carolina, and was of Scottish blood and Presbyterian training. He graduated at Union College in 1821; studied theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1823–1828, being in 1826–28 in charge of the classes of Charles Hodge; was licensed to preach by the Carlisle Presbytery in 1828; and in 1830–1840 was professor of Biblical literature in the newly founded Western Theological Seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary) of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut under the influence of Neander, he was gradually breaking away from \"Puritanic Presbyterianism\", and, in 1840, having resigned his chair in Allegheny, he was appointed professor of theology in the (German Reformed) Theological Seminary at Mercersburg, and thus passed from the Presbyterian Church into the German Reformed Church. He soon became prominent: first by his contributions to its organ, the \"Messenger\"; then by \"The Anxious Bench—A Tract for the Times\" (1843), attacking the vicious excesses of revivalistic methods; and by his defence of the inauguration address, \"The Principle of Protestantism\", delivered by his colleague Philip Schaff, which aroused a storm of protest by its suggestion that Pauline Protestantism was not the last word in the development of the church but that a Johannine Christianity was to be its out-growth, and by its recognition of Petrine Romanism as a stage in ecclesiastical development. To Dr. Schaff's 122 theses of \"The Principle of Protestantism\" Nevin added his own theory of the mystical union between Christ and believers, and both Schaff and Nevin were accused of a \"Romanizing tendency\".\n\nNevin characterized his critics as pseudo-Protestants, urged (with Dr. Charles Hodge, and against the Presbyterian General Assembly) the validity of Roman Catholic baptism, and defended the doctrine of the \"spiritual real presence\" of Christ in the Lord's Supper, notably in \"The Mystical Presence: a Vindication of the Reformed or Calvinistic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist\" (1846); to this Charles Hodge replied from the point of view of rationalistic puritanism in the \"Princeton Review\" of 1848.\n\nIn 1849, the \"Mercersburg Review\" was founded as the organ of Nevin and the \"Mercersburg Theology\"; and to it he contributed from 1849 to 1883. In 1851, he resigned from the Mercersburg Seminary in order that its running expenses might be lightened; and from 1841 to 1853 he was president of Marshall College at Mercersburg. With Dr. Schaff and others, he was on the committee which prepared the liturgy of the German Reformed Church, which appeared in provisional form in 1857 and as \"An Order of Worship\" in 1866. In 1861–1866, he was instructor of history at Franklin and Marshall College (into which Marshall College had been merged), of which he was president in 1866–1876. He died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on June 6, 1886.\n\nPublished works:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2299878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299878", "title": "Rick Benjamin (conductor)", "text": "Rick Benjamin (conductor)\n\nRick Benjamin is the founder and conductor of the world-renowned Paragon Ragtime Orchestra. Benjamin has an active career as a pianist and tubist as well as an arranger.\n\nBenjamin's interest in ragtime music began in the 1970s when he was eight years old and found a 1917 Victorola in his grandparents' garage. He later recalled that the music he played on the Victorola connected with him in a way that the pop music of his era did not. He said, \"I knew in my bones that these performers and their composers were expressing their sheer joy in life through their music.\"\n\nBenjamin's interest persisted in ragtime, the first popular music conceived and created by Americans in an era where popular songs were brought over from Germany or England.\n\nBenjamin went to Juilliard with intentions to make his living playing the tuba. When his jaw was wired shut after his teeth were inadvertently shattered during a tooth extraction, he found himself temporarily unable to play that instrument and instead focused on writing a research paper on Arthur Pryor, an 1890s trombonist, conductor and music director. Pryor was an influential figure in the early history of the Victrola, as he had served as first conductor for the company that produced them, Victor Talking Machine Co., and had accordingly been able to decide himself what recordings were released for the machine. Benjamin learned that an old theater in Asbury, New Jersey that was scheduled for demolition housed Pryor's personal collection of over 4,000 pieces of music and was given permission to take it. While Benjamin did not immediately understand the value of this collection, which was thought to have been destroyed, he soon realized that among the collection were many rare musical scores and manuscripts, including unknown compositions by such composers as Scott Joplin, W.C. Handy, Edward MacDowell, Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and John Philip Sousa.\n\nIn 1986 Benjamin decided to form a 14-piece orchestra of fellow Juilliard students to perform the music as it had been originally arranged during the period. Benjamin made a request to Juilliard to perform a concert of turn-of-the-20th-century American composers but his request was rejected by Juilliard's dean, who felt Juilliard should focus on traditional composers. Benjamin scheduled a Mozart program on solo tuba at a concert hall, but instead led a group in performing ragtime music, leaving open the doors to draw in a wider crowd. Before a full house, Benjamin's group played selections by Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert, the W.C. Handy's \"Memphis Blues\" and Joplin's \"Peacherine Two-Step.\" One witness to the event, Juilliard professor Vincent Persichetti, approached Benjamin after the concert was over to encourage him to make it his \"life's work\" to preserve \"America's original music.\"\n\nThe concert did not go over well with the dean, who put Benjamin on probation for it, but it had a much more positive impact on Grammy award winning Columbia Records executive Thomas Frost, who to Benjamin's surprise was given a recording of the concert and had within a matter of weeks arranged for the first album of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra to be released. Benjamin quit Juilliard without fanfare and has since devoted himself to his orchestra.\n\nBenjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra made their New York debut at the Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in March 1988 with a program consisting of a medley of music from the 1890s and 21 songs from the period ranging 1905 to 1920 which Benjamin had found among Pryor's papers. Allan Kozinn for the \"New York Times\" remarked particularly on the variety of the \"abidingly energetic fun\" performance, which included \"a concert waltz, a maxixe, one-steps, two-steps, foxtrots and blues, and, of course, numerous rags, some quite picturesque.\"\n\nIn February 1999, Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered \"Oh, You Kid!\" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, in collaboration with the Paul Taylor Dance Company. The work was commissioned under the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern Dance and Jazz Music of the Kennedy Center and American Dance Festival, which promotes such pairings. Anna Kisselgoff wrote in the \"New York Times\" that the show was \"exuberant romp to ragtime music.\"\n\nIn June 2003 Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered their version of Scott Joplin's opera \"Treemonisha\" at the Stern Grove Festival, the oldest festival of its kind in the United States, hosted in an amphitheater in San Francisco. \"Treemonisha\" had originally premiered in 1975 with full professional staging by the Houston Grand Opera, but Benjamin thought that the Houston staging was \"too heavy, too Verdiesque\" and spent nearly half of a decade altering it to suit the kind of 12-piece theater pit orchestra prevalent in Joplin's day. In October 2005 Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered his version of \"Treemonisha\" on the East Coast at Wake Forest University.\n\nBenjamin has expressed his hope that his simpler orchestration will allow the material to be presented in more modest venues, indicating that Joplin never intended for the \"opera\" to depend on a large orchestra. Describing the work as \"unpretentious\", he notes that the opera \"is much more an amalgamation of the well-established American traditions of vaudeville, tab-show, melodrama, and minstrelsy, all held together by Joplin's marvelous music.\" He told the Wake Forest University newspaper that Joplin's \"real dream was to give everyday people the opportunity, perhaps their only one, to experience opera on their own terms in the music halls and neighborhood theaters.\" In another interview, for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Benjamin indicated that Joplin was probably himself barred from opera during his day because he was black, but expressed his belief that Joplin realized opera's ability to speak to the public. He has recently recorded the opera with new world records.\n\nBenjamin has an extensive collection of period cinema-orchestra scores which his orchestra performs along with broadcasting of the films they were created to accompany. Silent movies for which they perform the score include Buster Keaton's \"Cops\", Harold Lloyd's \"Never Weaken\", and Charlie Chaplin's \"The Immigrant\". Another movie that Benjamin performs with his orchestra is 'The Mark Of Zorro' starring Douglas Fairbanks. Benjamin has expressed surprise that \"Generation X\" has responded so favorably to the music, suggesting in 1997 that younger listeners may resist the more commercially oriented music \"crammed down their throats.\"\n\nBenjamin and his orchestra also have performed for diverse radio programs on \"New York Times\"' WQXR, National Public Radio, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Voice of America networks, and Benjamin has conducted the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra (Denmark), the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra, Olympia Symphony in Washington State, the New Jersey Symphony, the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, the Washington Performing Arts Society, the Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria. Benjamin is a touring lecturer and a published author and wrote liner notes on New World Records In addition to curating the collection of Arthur Prior, Benjamin also curates the collections of Simone Mantia, B.F. Alart, and Frank H. Wells and has worked with archivists and historians including Thornton 'Tony Hagert's Vernacular Music Research\n\nIn the World's Fair held in Seville, Spain, Benjamin and his orchestra were the \"Ambassador of Goodwill.\"\n\nBecause orchestras by their nature and tradition are much more fluid in regards to personnel, there are 36 players on the payroll of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra and their appearance at a particular performance depends on a wide variety of criteria including the number of players called for by the score(s) to be performed. The score for the silent motion picture Zorro was written for 12 instruments while the orchestra's ragtime program is scored for 10 or 11 players, depending on the publisher and arranger. The main set-up for a theater orchestra of the era was 5 strings, 1 flute, 1/2 clarinets, 1/2 cornets, 1 trombone, Piano/Conductor and percussion. Variations on the instrumentation depended on the publisher of the music, and of the arrangement. Some of the orchestra's programs of historic theater music call for from 25 to 30 musicians and some of the grand silent film scores call for over 70 players, so the orchestra has to hire out when they perform these programs.\n\nThe Road Manager for the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra is Leslie Cullen who also plays flute and piccolo and has been a member of the orchestra since 1989. Cullen studied at the Juilliard School and is an adjunct at Bucknell University. Cullen has appeared at the Ravinia Festival, The Kennedy Center, Chautauqua, and the Smithsonian Institution. Cullen is a native of Lawton, Oklahoma and was the former artist-in-residence for the State Arts Council of Oklahoma. Cullen has also played with the Royale Trio and the Linden Woodwind Quintet.\n\nIn addition to his work with his orchestra, Benjamin lectures at Bucknell University, near his home in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Benjamin was greatly encouraged in his musical career by his grandfather, J. Edward Smith, who played violin, clarinet & piano, among other instruments, throughout his life, and was a musician with the Monmouth Symphony Orchestra, in Monmouth County, NJ, for many years until his death. Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra continue to perform regularly in Monmouth County, NJ venues, where both grandfather and grandson lived.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2299898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299898", "title": "Green World", "text": "Green World\n\nGreen World is a literary concept defined by the critic Northrop Frye in his book, \"Anatomy of Criticism\" (1957). Frye defines this term using Shakespeare's romantic comedies as the foundation. In \"Anatomy of Criticism\", Frye describes the Green World as \"the archetypal function of literature in visualizing the world of desire, not as an escape from \"reality,\" but as the genuine form of the world that human life tries to imitate.\" The plots of these comedies often follow the formula of action starting in the normal world and then progressing to an alternate one in which the conflict is resolved before returning to the normal world. The plot of the Shakespearean romantic comedy is built upon the tradition established by the medieval \"season ritual-play,\" the plots of which thematically deal with the triumph of love over the wasteland. The concept of the Green World is used to contrast the civilized world of man with the often harsh natural world.\n\nAs noted in Frye's \"Anatomy of Criticism\", the \"drama of the green world\" is embodied in the works of William Shakespeare. The thematic tones of the plays contain the overarching appearance of humanity eclipsing the natural worlds displayed.\n\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" serves as an exploration of the green world through the fairies' interference in the romantic entanglement of the Athenian lovers. The majority of the play's action takes place in the woods outside of Theseus' Athens, with Shakespeare primarily using Athens to frame the narrative in civilization. The woods of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" serves as an analogy to a dream-like world created out of our desires that serves to contrast the \"stumbling and blinded follies of the world of experience.\"\n\nIn the more urban setting of \"Romeo and Juliet\", the green world becomes associated with the intimacy of romantic emotion and is notable in its \"protracted absences.\" Romeo journeys in solitary walks into the woods surrounding Verona to lament his ill-fated romance with Rosaline and remove him from a world occupied by more human matters.\n\n\"As You Like It\", also contains considerable references to the green world. The Forest of Arden is both idealized through the usage of pastoral terms, but is also depicted in a way that shows how humans manipulate and exploit it. While the play makes use of typical pastoral motifs in describing the forest, these are often juxtaposed with images of the wood as a wild place–showing a dialectic tension between the new inhabitants and long standing forest.\n\n\"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\", also exhibits signs of the literary green world. The comedy's protagonist, Valentine, enters the woods and shortly becomes the leader of a band of outlaws; afterwards, however, the other characters all venture out into the forest and become converted. As Frye notes using this example: \"...the action of the comedy begins in a world represented by as a normal world, moves into the green world, goes into a metamorphosis there in which the comic resolution is achieved, and returns to the normal world.\"\n\nIn \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", The Green Knight is completely green, right down to his skin: he is \"nature anthropomorphized.\" He challenges King Arthur's court by accusing them of being too indulgent rather than courageous. Sir Gawain must travel through winter's brutal conditions to arrive at Bertilak's court, which is described [by... ] as the \"antithesis of winter.\"\nDespite Sir Gawain being attacked by \"unnamed giants,\" it is made clear that the greatest threat to his survival is the harsh winter landscape as made evident in line 726 of the poem: \"For werre wrathed hym not so much þat wynter nas wors.\"\n\nUpon entering this alternate world, Sir Gawain is surrounded by abundance and warmth. The Green World is represented both by the frightening challenge made by the Green Knight, as well as by the refuge of Bertilak's court. Nature's cruel forcefulness as well as its power to protect are aspects of the Green World, as it offers an alternate reality in which a problem is resolved. The Green Knight, representing nature, threatens the comfortable lives of the members of King Arthur's court. The Green Chapel is described as a bare wasteland which shows another way in which nature is presented.\n\n\n"}

The UK edition retailed at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6) and the US edition at $2.95.\n\nA crucial witness is unaware of his role as such until two years after a man is found guilty of a murder. When he realizes the information he holds, he re-opens the pain of loss in a family, and re-opens the question of who was the murderer two years ago.\n\nThis novel received mixed reviews at the time of publication, as reviewers were not generally comfortable with the psychological aspects of the story. The plot had her \"customary ingenuity\" but lacked \"blitheness\" and was \"much too like an attempt at psychological fiction\". Sympathy is evoked for too many characters, \"but the unravelling is sound and the story well told.\" Another said there is ingenuity and a good ending, but the plot \"lacks a central focus\" and it appears that the \"serious socio-psychological approach doesn't suit\" Christie's writing. A later review considered it one of the better Christie novels of the 1950s, and noted that the author sometimes called it her own favourite.\n\nJacko Argyle dies in prison while serving a sentence for killing his adoptive mother Rachel Argyle. His own widow, Maureen, believed him to have been responsible. Jacko's alibi failed when police could not find the man who had given him a ride to the next town as the murder was happening. Two years later, Jacko's alibi suddenly appears and the family must come to terms not only with the fact that Jacko was innocent, but also with suspicion falling upon each of them as the real murderer. Some realize there is a murderer living among them, raising tensions among the family. Suspicions fall on his father, his brother, his sisters, even his father’s secretary and the long-time housekeeper, as the new investigations proceed. \n\nThe witness, Arthur Calgary, was unaware of the trial and thus failed to come forward. He believes the Argyle family will be grateful when he clears their son's name but fails to realise the full implications of the information he provides. However, once he does so, he is determined to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. \n\nCalgary visits retired local doctor, Dr MacMaster, to ask him about Jacko. MacMaster says that he was surprised when Jacko was convicted for killing Rachel, not because murder was outside Jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought Jacko would be too cowardly to kill somebody; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would hire an accomplice. Calgary speaks to Maureen, who reveals Jacko's persuasive ways with older women. While the police and Calgary gather new information and seek the murderer, Mickey plans to meet with Tina, as he knows she had heard something that night, which seemed irrelevant back then. It is Philip Durrant, husband of Mary Argyle, whose efforts to find the guilty one among them force the killer to strike again.\n\nTina comes to Sunny Point to meet with Philip. As she reaches his room, Kirsten is at the door with a tray, and they see that Philip is dead at his desk. Tina walks until she collapses outdoors where Mickey sees her, thinks she fainted, and carries her inside. Doctor Craig arrives and sees that Tina has been stabbed in the back and must go to hospital.\n\nHester tells Calgary about Philip and Tina. Calgary heads to Superintendent Huish, who repeats the words Tina spoke in hospital, that the cup was empty, Philip's cup, meaning Kirsten was leaving not entering the room. At Sunny Point, Calgary reveals to all, in the library, that the killer is the housekeeper, Kirsten. Jacko had persuaded the plain Kirsten that he was in love with her, and persuaded her to murder Mrs Argyle to steal some much needed money, money his mother would not give him. When Kirsten learned that Jacko was secretly married, meeting his wife the day after the murder, Kirsten realized what a fool she had been and sees the evil in Jacko.\n\nKirsten runs away, and the family expect the police will nab her. While Mary mourns her beloved husband, her sister Hester professes her love for Arthur Calgary. She suspects that Tina and Mickey will get together once Tina recovers. Leo feels free once again to remarry.\n\n\nPhilip John Stead concluded his review in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" of 12 December 1958, with, \"The solution of \"Ordeal By Innocence\" is certainly not below the level of Mrs Christie's customary ingenuity, but the book lacks other qualities which her readers have come to expect. What has become of the blitheness, the invigorating good spirits with which the game of detection is played in so many of her stories? \"Ordeal By Innocence\" slips out of that cheerful arena into something much too like an attempt at psychological fiction. It is too much of a conversation piece and too many people are talking – people in whom it is hard to take the necessary amount of interest because there is not enough space to establish them. The kind of workmanship which has been lavished on this tale is not a kind in which the author excels and the reader feels that Miss Marple and Poirot would thoroughly disapprove of the whole business.\"\n\nSarah Russell of \"The Guardian\" gave a short review to the novel in the 9 December 1958 issue when she said, \"In this solving of a two-year-old family murder sympathy is, unusually with Miss Christie, evoked for too many people to leave enough suspects; but the unravelling is sound and the story well told.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson said of this novel that \"The veteran Norn has nodded over this one. There is ingenuity, of course, but it lacks a central focus. The characters are stodgy and there is little of that so readable, almost crunchable dialogue, like burnt sugar.\" He concluded, \"The serious socio-psychological approach doesn't suit A C somehow. Only at the end with the big surprise do you feel home and dry.\"\n\nRobert Barnard considered this novel as \"One of the best of 'fifties Christies, and one of her own favourites (though she named different titles at different times). The \"Five Little Pigs\" pattern of murder-in-the-past, the convicted murderer having died in prison, innocent. [sic]” His evaluation was that it was “Short on detection, but fairly dense in social observation. Understanding in treatment of adopted children, but not altogether tactful on the colour question: 'Tina's always the dark horse…Perhaps it's the half of her that isn't white.'\"\n\n\nA film adaptation was released in 1985, directed by Desmond Davis. It starred Donald Sutherland as Arthur Calgary, Sarah Miles as Mary Durrant, Christopher Plummer as Leo Argyle, Ian McShane as Philip Durrant, Diana Quick as Gwenda Vaughan, and Faye Dunaway as Rachel Argyle.\n\nThe film's musical score by Dave Brubeck was criticised as inappropriate for its style of mystery. Brubeck had taken over from Pino Donaggio, who had already composed many pieces for the project, but was too busy to work on the project when various film edits needed re-scoring. His original score had swirling strings, lush melodies and tension-filled passages.\n\n\nThe novel was adapted for the third season of the ITV television series \"Marple\" featuring Geraldine McEwan as the eponymous Miss Marple in 2007, although the character was not in the original novel. The episode guest-starred Denis Lawson as Leo, Stephanie Leonidas as Hester, Lisa Stansfield as Mary, and Jane Seymour as Rachel. This version changed considerably from the novel, such as having Jacko (Burn Gorman) executed by hanging, rather than dying in prison of natural causes. \n\nGwenda Vaughan (Juliet Stevenson) takes Philip Durrant's (Richard Armitage) place as the household member who fatefully decides to investigate and comes too close to the truth, and is subsequently murdered by the killer, Kirsten (Alison Steadman). Omitted completely is Kirsten's attempt to silence Tina (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Micky (Bryan Dick) by stabbing Tina. There is also the addition of another adopted child, Bobby (Tom Riley), the twin brother of Jacko, who commits suicide after financial ruin. Kirsten is shown being arrested at the end, unlike in the original novel in which her arrest was not explicitly included in the actual text.\n\n\nBBC One broadcast a three-episode series based on \"Ordeal by Innocence\" in 2018. It was filmed in Inverkip, Scotland, and stars Bill Nighy as Leo Argyll (changed from \"Argyle\" in the novel), Luke Treadaway as Arthur Calgary, Anna Chancellor as Rachel Argyll, Ella Purnell as Hester Argyll, Eleanor Tomlinson as Mary Durrant, Crystal Clarke as Tina Argyll, Morven Christie as Kirsten Lindstrom, Matthew Goode as Philip Durrant, Alice Eve as Gwenda Vaughan, and Anthony Boyle as Jack Argyll. The script was written by Sarah Phelps, who also adapted the Christie miniseries \"And Then There Were None\" and \"The Witness for the Prosecution\" for the BBC. First scheduled to air in 2017, the series was delayed due to sexual allegations against actor Ed Westwick, who was originally cast as Mickey Argyll, which led to Westwick's scenes being reshot with Christian Cooke as Mickey.\n\nThe series features many differences from the original novel, including the ending, where the killer is revealed to be Leo instead of Kirsten. Additionally, Jack is depicted as having no involvement with Rachel's murder and is the biological son of Leo and Kirsten, resulting in Leo having him beaten to death in prison when he threatens to reveal his true parentage. The series also portrays Calgary as a former mental patient, which causes doubts toward his testimony as Jack's alibi.\n\nThe novel was also adapted into a stage play by Mary Jane Hansen performed for the first time by the New York State Theatre Institute in Troy, New York. The original run lasted from 4 to 17 February 2007, and included 14 performances.\n\n\"Ordeal by Innocence\" was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 1 July 2008, adapted and illustrated by \"Chandre\" (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by in 2006 under the title of \"Témoin indésirable\".\n\nThe BBC produced a radio adaptation by Joy Wilkinson, starring Mark Umbers as Arthur Calgary and Jacqueline Defferary as Gwenda. It was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 over three weeks beginning 17 March 2014.\n\n\nIn the UK the novel was first serialised in the weekly magazine \"John Bull\" in two abridged instalments from 20 September (Volume 104, Number 2725) to 27 September 1958 (Volume 104, Number 2726) with illustrations by \"Fancett\".\n\nIn the US, the first publication was in the \"Chicago Tribune\" in thirty-six parts from Sunday, 1 February to Saturday, 14 March 1959 under the title of \"The Innocent\".\n\nAn abridged version of the novel was also published in the 21 February 1959 issue of the \"Star Weekly Complete Novel\", a Toronto newspaper supplement, with a cover illustration by Russell Maebus.\n\n\n\n"}

The UK edition retailed at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6), and the US edition at $2.95.\n\nIt features Christie's Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who makes a very late appearance in the final third of the novel. The emphasis on espionage in the early part of the story relates it to Christie's international adventures (such as \"They Came to Baghdad\") and to the Tommy and Tuppence stories.\n\nA revolution takes place within Ramat, a fictional kingdom in the Middle East. Before their deaths, Prince Ali Yusuf entrusts his pilot, Bob Rawlinson, to smuggle a fortune in jewels out of the country. These are concealed in the luggage of his sister, Joan Sutcliffe, and her daughter Jennifer. Unbeknown to him, a mysterious woman watches him conceal them from the balcony of a neighbouring room. Three months later, Jennifer prepares to attend Meadowbank School, a prestigious girls' prep school in England. Its staff includes Miss Bulstrode, the school's founder and headmistress; Miss Chadwick, a co-founder of the school; Miss Vansittart, a teacher for several years; Miss Rich, a teacher for eighteen months; Miss Johnson, the girl's matron; Angèle Blanche, the new French teacher; Grace Springer, the new gym teacher; Ann Shapland, Bulstrode's new secretary; and Adam Goodman, the new gardener. Bulstrode is nearing retirement, so she decides to seek a successor. As Chadwick is considered to be too old, Bulstrode is left to choose between Vansittart, whom many believe she will choose, and Rich, who is young and has lots of ideas.\n\nOne night, Springer is found shot dead in the Sports Pavilion by Johnson and Chadwick. When police arrive to investigate, Goodman reveals to Bulstrode that he works for British Intelligence - he is at Meadowbank to track down the gems Rawlinson smuggled out, while monitoring Princess Shaista, Ali Yusuf's cousin, who is attending the school for this term. During the investigation, Jennifer complains that her racquet feels unbalanced since being abroad, and switches it for that of her friend Julia Upjohn, while she awaits a new one. Later, a woman gives Jennifer a new racquet to replace her current one, claiming it is from her Aunt Gina. However, the sharper Julia suspects this is not the case as the two girls had swapped racquets, and Aunt Gina later writes to reveal that she had not sent her niece the new racquet. The following weekend, Shaista is kidnapped by someone posing as her uncle's chauffeur, while on the night of the kidnapping, Vansittart is murdered with a sandbag in the Sports Pavilion.\n\nWhile many of the girls are sent home, Julia investigates Jennifer's racquet, and finds the smuggled jewels within a hollow in the handle. When someone attempts to enter her room during the night, she quickly flees the school to tell her story to Hercule Poirot. Arriving at Meadowbank to investigate the murders, he learns that Blanche had been recently murdered with a sandbag - the police suspect she knew the killer's identity and attempted to blackmail them. Interviewing Bulstrode, he learns that she believed Julia's mother Mrs Upjohn, who had served in military intelligence, had noticed someone at the school on Parent's Day whom she recalled seeing from fifteen years ago. Poirot eventually reveals to all that the Shaista who attended Meadowbank was an imposter; the real Shaista was kidnapped by a group seeking Ali Yusuf's jewels. When the imposter couldn't find them, the group extracted her before the police presence at the school exposed her. Poirot then explains that the motive for the murders was the missing gems, whereupon he denounces Ann Shapland as the killer - she had been in Ramat three months ago and was the woman who had witnessed Rawlinson concealing the gems in Jennifer's racquet.\n\nPoirot reveals that Springer was killed because she caught Shapland searching for the racquet, while Blanche was killed for her attempted blackmail in regards to the Springer murder. Through Mrs Upjohn, Poirot identifies her as a ruthless espionage agent known as \"Angelica\". Before Shapland is arrested, she attempts to shoot Mrs Upjohn; Miss Bulstrode tries to shield her, but Chadwick steps in faster to shield both and is fatally wounded. Shapland is disarmed and taken away. Poirot reveals that the second murder was not Shapland's work. Although she had killed the would-be blackmailer Mlle Blanche in the same manner to make a link between the two, she had an airtight alibi for Vansittart's killing. That was done by Chadwick, who was jealous of Vansittart as Bulstrode's chosen successor. Chadwick found her in the Sports Pavilion and struck her down in a fit of madness. Before dying, Chadwick confesses to Bulstrode. In the aftermath of the investigation, Bulstrode appoints Rich as her successor, with both focusing on rebuilding Meadowbank. Meanwhile, Poirot turns over the gems to be delivered to an English woman who had secretly married Ali Yusuf when he was a student, with Julia receiving one of them as a reward.\n\n\nMaurice Richardson of \"The Observer\" of 8 November 1959 said, \"Some nice school scenes with bogus sheikhs sweeping up in lilac Cadillacs to deposit highly scented and busted houris for education, and backwoods peers shoving hockey-stick-toting daughters out of battered Austins. It's far from vintage Christie, but you'll want to know who.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Girls' school background surprisingly well done, with humour and some liberality of outlook. Some elements are reminiscent of Tey's \"Miss Pym Disposes\". Marred by the international dimension and the spy element, which do not jell with the traditional detective side. Fairly typical example of her looser, more relaxed style.\"\n\nIn Chapter 17, III, of the novel, Julia tells Poirot that she has been told of him by Maureen Summerhayes, at whose rather dilapidated guest house he had been forced to stay during the case related in \"Mrs. McGinty's Dead\". Also, Miss Bulstrode is mentioned in a later Poirot novel with a strong school-girl plot, \"Hallowe'en Party\".\n\nIn Chapter 13, II, of the novel, mention is made of popular British comedy actress Joyce Grenfell. In 1957, Grenfell had appeared in \"Blue Murder at St Trinian's\", a comedy set in a girls' school with a plot that includes a jewel thief and a foreign prince.\n\nThe location of the fictional Sheikdom of Ramat is not revealed in the novel, but by some hints (proximity to Aden and mountains) it is likely that Ramat was one of numerous principalities of south Yemen which still existed at the time when the book was finished. Sheik Ali Yusuf of Ramat was a graduate of an unnamed English public school. Agatha Christie spent considerable time in Iraq, whose last King, Feisal II, was a graduate of Harrow.\n\nAn adaptation of the novel was made for the series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" on 28 September 2008, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The cast included Dame Harriet Walter as Miss Bulstrode, Natasha Little as Ann Shapland, Claire Skinner as Miss Rich, Susan Wooldridge as Miss Chadwick, Miranda Raison as Mlle Blanche, Elizabeth Berrington as Miss Springer, Katie Leung as Hsui Tai Wan, Raji James as Prince Ali Yusuf, and Adam Croasdell as Adam Goodman. Written by Mark Gatiss, the adaptation featured a change in setting to the 1930s, matching that for the TV series, which meant that many of the novel's scenes set in Egypt and the Middle East, as well as those related to the British secret service had to be rewritten or eliminated. As such, the adaptation features a significant number of plot changes:\n\n\n\nIn the UK the novel was first serialised in the weekly magazine \"John Bull\" in six abridged instalments from 26 September (Volume 106, Number 2771) to 31 October 1959 (Volume 106, Number 2776) with illustrations by Gerry Fancett. In the US a condensed version of the novel appeared in the November 1959 (Volume LXXVI, Number 11) issue of the \"Ladies Home Journal\" with an illustration by Joe DeMers.\n\n"}

He is widely regarded as an authority on the development and evolution of mountain ranges.\n\nDewey was educated at Bancroft's School and Queen Mary and Imperial College at the University of London where he was awarded a BSc and PhD in geology. Following a period as lecturer at the University of Manchester (1960–64), the University of Cambridge (1964–1970) and Memorial University of Newfoundland (1971), Dewey was appointed Professor of Geology at the State University of New York at Albany. During this period he produced a series of classic papers centred on the history of the Appalachians in Newfoundland as well as the Scottish and Irish Caledonides. In later years, his research has concentrated upon producing a model to describe the development and orogenic history of the Himalayan mountain range.\n\nDewey returned to the UK in 1982 as Professor of Geology at the University of Durham, a position he held for four years. As with several Durham geologists before him, notably Lawrence Wager, Dewey was appointed Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford (and Fellow of University College) in 1986, a position he held until his resignation in 2000. Since then he has returned to the US as Professor of Geology at the University of California at Davis, although he maintains a position as Senior Research Fellow at University College, Oxford.\n\nJohn Dewey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (FRS) in 1985 and has received numerous medals and awards, notably the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society of London (that society's highest award) in 1999 and the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America (1992). Dewey was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1997., is a Member of the Royal Irish Academy and is a Corresponding Member of the Australian Academy of Science (2011).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2299941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299941", "title": "The Pale Horse", "text": "The Pale Horse\n\nThe Pale Horse is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1961, and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at fifteen shillings (15/- = 75p) and the US edition at $3.75. The novel features her novelist detective Ariadne Oliver as a minor character, and reflects in tone the supernatural novels of Dennis Wheatley who was then at the height of his popularity. The Pale Horse is mentioned in Revelation 6:8, where it is ridden by Death.\n\nA dying woman, Mrs Davis, gives her last confession to Father Gorman, a Catholic priest, but along with her confession she gives him a list of names and a terrible secret. Before he can take action, however, he is struck dead in the fog. As the police begin to investigate, a young hero begins to piece together evidence that sets him upon a converging path.\n\n\"In the following summary, events are not given in strict narrative order.\"\n\nMark Easterbrook, the hero of the book and its principal narrator, sees a fight between two girls in a Chelsea coffee bar during which one pulls out some of the other's hair at the roots. Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions something called the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more.\n\nWhen Mark encounters the police surgeon, Corrigan, he learns of the list of surnames found in the shoe of a murdered priest named Father Gorman. The list includes the names Corrigan, Tuckerton and Hesketh-Dubois (the same name as Mark's godmother who has recently died of what appear to be natural causes). He begins to fear that the list contains the names of those dead or shortly to die.\n\nWhen Mark goes to Much Deeping with the famous mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver, to a village fete organised by his cousin, he learns of a house converted from an old inn called the Pale Horse, now inhabited by three modern \"witches\" led by Thyrza Grey. Visiting houses in the area, he meets a wheelchair-using man, Mr Venables, who has no apparent explanation for his substantial wealth. He also visits the Pale Horse, where Thyrza discusses with Mark the ability to kill at a distance, which she claims to have developed. In retrospect it seems to Mark that she has been outlining to him a service that she would be willing to provide. In the police investigation, there is a witness, Zachariah Osborne, who describes a man seen following Father Gorman shortly before the murder. Later, he contacts the police to say that he has seen this same man in a wheelchair: it is Venables. When he learns that Venables suffered from polio and is incapable of standing due to atrophy of the legs, Osborne is nonetheless certain of his identification and begins to suggest ways that Venables could have faked his own disability.\n\nWhen Mark's girlfriend Hermia does not take his growing fears seriously, he becomes disaffected with her. He does, however, receive support from Ariadne Oliver, and from a vicar's wife (Mrs Dane Calthrop) who desires him to stop whatever evil may be taking place. He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him the means by which the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that someone will die within a certain period of time and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).\n\nWith the agreement of Inspector Lejeune and the co-operation of Ginger, Mark agrees to solicit the murder of his first wife, who will be played by Ginger. At a ritual of some kind at the Pale Horse, Mark witnesses Thyrza apparently channel a malignant spirit through an electrical apparatus. Shortly afterwards, Ginger falls ill and begins to decline rapidly. In desperation, Mark turns to Poppy again, who now mentions a friend (Eileen Brandon) who resigned from a research organisation called CRC (Customers' Reactions Classified) that seems to be connected with the Pale Horse. When Mrs Brandon is interviewed, she reveals that both she and Mrs Davis worked for the organisation, which surveyed targeted people about what foods, cosmetics and proprietary medicines they used.\n\nMrs Oliver now contacts Mark with a key connection that she has made: another victim of the Pale Horse (Mary Delafontaine) has lost her hair during her illness. The same thing happened to Lady Hesketh-Dubois, and Thomasina's hair was easily pulled out during the fight. Moreover, Ginger has begun to shed her own hair. Mark recognises that these are symptoms, not of satanic assassination of some sort, but of thallium poisoning.\n\nAt the end of the novel it is revealed that Osborne has been the brains behind the Pale Horse organisation; the black magic element was entirely a piece of misdirection on his part, while the murders were really committed by replacing products the victims had named in the CRC survey with poisoned ones. Osborne's clumsy attempt to implicate Venables was his final mistake. After Osborne's arrest, Mark and Ginger, who is recovering, become engaged.\n\n\n\nFrancis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) praised the novel in the 8 December 1961 issue of \"The Guardian\": \"Mrs Agatha Christie is our nearest approach to perpetual motion. And not only does she never stop, but she drops the ball into the cup nearly every time; and if one is sometimes reminded of those automatic machines where one pulls a handle and out pops the finished product, that is a compliment to the automatic machine and not by any means a reflection on Mrs Christie. For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. \"The Pale Horse\" is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty. The black magic theme is handled in a masterly and sinister fashion, and to give away what lay behind it would be unforgivable. This is a book which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss.\" Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's \"Critic's choice\" for the end of the year, published one week later, writing that \"It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items. The best puzzle has certainly been Agatha Christie's \"The Pale Horse\".\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Goodish late example – loosely plotted, but with intriguing, fantastical central idea. Plot concerns a Murder-Inc.-type organisation, with a strong overlay of black magic. Also makes use of 'The Box,' a piece of pseudo-scientific hocus-pocus fashionable in the West Country in the 'fifties (one of the things which drove Waugh to the verge of lunacy, as narrated in \"Pinfold\").\"\n\nIn the \"Binge!\" article of \"Entertainment Weekly\" Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked \"The Pale Horse\" as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of the \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".\n\nThis novel is notable as several of her earlier characters reappear in this book. In addition to Ariadne Oliver, Major Despard and his wife Rhoda (who met and fell in love in \"Cards on the Table\") also participate in the plot. Mrs Dane Calthrop from \"The Moving Finger\" also reappears in approximately the same role as she played in that book: the rational but devoted Christian who wants the evil stopped.\n\nMrs Oliver is apprehensive of attending a fete, for reasons that will be apparent to readers of her previous appearance in a Christie novel: \"Dead Man's Folly\".\n\nMrs Lancaster from \"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\" may have been mentioned in a conversation, when one of the characters, David Ardingly, mentions how he met an old lady in a mental home who says exactly the same phrase which chilled Tuppence to the bone, and which had a similar effect on Ardingly. Mrs Lancaster mentioned \"ten past eleven\", though, while Ardingly's recollection placed the mentioned time at \"12.10\".\n\nThis novel is notable among Christie's books as it is credited with having saved at least two lives after readers recognised the symptoms of thallium poisoning from its description in the book.\n\n\nThe novel is also cited to have been the \"inspiration\" of what was dubbed \"The Mensa Murder\". In 1988, George Trepal, a Mensa Club member, poisoned his neighbours, Pye and Peggy Carr and their children, with thallium introduced in a Coca-Cola Classic bottles eight-pack. Peggy Carr succumbed while the others survived the attack.\n\nThe novel was first adapted for TV by ITV in 1996, in a 100-minute TV film with Colin Buchanan as Mark Easterbrook. This version omitted the character of Ariadne Oliver. It makes Easterbrook the suspect in the killing of Father Gorman. At first it seems that the murders are masterminded by Venables, who it transpires is not disabled, but ultimately Osbourne is still revealed as the murderer.\n\nA second adaptation was later made by the same network, done by Russell Lewis for the fifth series of ITV's \"Agatha Christie's Marple\" starring Julia McKenzie in 2010. As the character of Miss Marple was made the chief sleuth of the plot, several changes were made for the adaptation:\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Sarah Phelps, who had written several Christie adaptations for BBC and Mammoth Screen, would write a new adaptation of \"The Pale Horse\". The two-part series was broadcast on 9 and 16 February 2020 on BBC One. The cast included Rufus Sewell as Mark Easterbrook, Sean Pertwee as Inspector Lejeune, Bertie Carvel as Zachariah Osborne, Kaya Scodelario as Hermia, and Sheila Atim, Rita Tushingham and Kathy Kiera Clarke as the “witches” of Much Deeping. It deviated from the novel in many ways: the cast list was missing 'Ariadne Oliver' and 'Ginger' while introducing other characters, and Mark Easterbrook is a twice-married antihero. \"The Independent\" noted that it had a \"satisfying conclusion despite traditional whodunnit thrills\", while \"The Telegraph\" asserted that it chucked \"the rat-filled kitchen sink into this rewrite of Agatha Christie\".\n\nThe novel has been adapted twice for BBC Radio:\n\n\nThe novel was first serialised in the British weekly magazine \"Woman’s Mirror\" in eight abridged instalments from 2 September to 21 October 1961 with illustrations by Zelinski.\n\nIn the US a condensed version of the novel appeared in the April 1962 (Volume LXXIX, Number 4) issue of the \"Ladies Home Journal\" with an illustration by Eugenie Louis.\n\n"}

{"id": "2299970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299970", "title": "Kerry Weaver", "text": "Kerry Weaver\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver, portrayed by Laura Innes, is a fictional character on the NBC television series \"ER\"; she first appeared as a recurring character actor in season 2, and became a regular cast member in season 3. In January 2007, Innes left the show after 12 years with the character of Kerry Weaver moving to Florida. Weaver appeared in the third largest number of episodes after John Carter and Chuny Marquez.\n\nVery little of Weaver's background was revealed to the audience early on. The character exhibits a limp in her gait, which is aided by the use of a forearm crutch, later revealed to be caused by congenital hip dysplasia in episode 14 of season 11, and that she had lived for a period in Africa.\n\nWeaver arrived at County General as Chief Resident and later became an attending physician. She was promoted to Chief of Emergency Medicine and finally Hospital Chief of Staff. Her administrative position often forced her to make unpleasant decisions that drew hostility from her fellow physicians, as when she fired Jeanie Boulet in Season 4. She is often the villain in many episodes prioritizing herself and her career over the well-being of other ER workers and, even, patients. Her behavior is often hypocritical, condescending, and arrogant.\n\nHaving had some heterosexual relationships, Weaver eventually came out as a lesbian. Her sexual orientation was a key point in some of the episodes, particularly when she fought in court to keep her son, Henry. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters.\n\nDuring Innes' first six seasons on the show, little was revealed about the details of Weaver's background which would later become some of her defining traits: her sexual orientation, political beliefs, and even the precise nature of her disability. These were closely guarded secrets for a woman who wanted to succeed professionally, but feared discrimination. She was also unable to fully deal with her internalized homophobia and regretted that she never knew her birth parents.\n\nWhen she was first hired by Mark Greene as chief resident in 1995, this let down much of the ER staff who didn't care for her detail-oriented approach in the trauma rooms. Early in her position, she would often clash with Doug Ross and resident Susan Lewis over most of the procedures in patient care. In addition, her strong belief in administrative policies would be dragged out into every unnecessary aspect in the workplace (in one episode, Jerry, the desk clerk, brought cake celebrating her day off). In Season 3, Kerry became an ER attending physician alongside Mark Greene, whom she would always manage to compete with or maneuver to catch the eye of her superiors.\n\nAs a result, it was difficult for anyone — the audience or any of the other characters — to really know Weaver beyond her tough and bureaucratic professionalism. In an early glimpse into her soul, Weaver defended Jeanie Boulet, played by Gloria Reuben, a physician assistant who contracted HIV from her adulterous husband. Later Boulet contracts Hepatitis C from a needle stick accident involving an infected patient. She fought to keep her job and dignity, while some doctors worried about the liability involved in having an HIV-positive employee in the ER. Weaver was the first person in a position of power to side with Jeanie, and the two remained friends until Jeanie's budget-related firing and her successful pressure campaign to get her job back. They reconciled and were close friends again when Jeanie left the ER to be with her new husband and raise her adopted HIV-positive son, Carlos.\n\nWeaver demonstrated a great deal of compassion and a moral commitment to civil rights, and that helped her and Dr. Greene draft an ER policy for HIV-positive employees. This storyline developed Weaver's character beyond that of a stoic, abrasive professional. In future episodes, she agreed to look the other way when Dr. John Carter helped a teenage runaway escape her homophobic parents who sent her away to an ex-gay camp.\n\nIn 1997, Weaver went through a brief relationship with Ellis West (played by Clancy Brown), an M.D. working for the Synergix Group, which was under consideration by County for a general management contract of the ER. Despite his claims to the contrary, she eventually came to the conclusion that West had begun a relationship with her in order to gain her approval of the contract. West said she was wrong and withdrew the proposal.\n\nAfter Carter was fired from his RA position and had nowhere to live, he followed an ad which led him to Dr. Weaver's house; she had been renting out her basement apartment to college students. For the first time, the audience saw the inside of her city home, and noted that she was single and independent, lived in a nice home, and had a particular taste in music. Weaver also hired a private investigator to locate her birth mother, an effort that initially failed and revealed Weaver's fear that she was raised by adoptive parents because her mother could not accept a disabled daughter.\n\nIn 1998, during Season 4, Kerry was briefly debilitated when an explosion at chemical plant sent victims flooding in, creating a toxic benzene spill in the ER. Weaver suffered a convulsive (Generalized Tonic Clonic or Grand Mal) seizure from the effects of the toxins. She was treated by Dr. Carter and Dr. Anna Del Amico. With Weaver debilitated and Dr. Greene out of town, Carter was forced to take charge of the ER for the first time.\n\nEver since her arrival at County General, Kerry had been very ambitious in pursuing higher administrative titles, such as Chief of Emergency Medicine. This was after Dr. Morgenstern's long, extensive absence, that a new position needed to be filled. For a short period she was made interim acting chief of emergency medicine until a suitable replacement was found. Yet, after an incident involving the hiring of a doctor who turned out to be a very accomplished if bizarre non-physician, Kerry's chances were luckily left open. However, she discovered that the hospital wasn't really considering her for the position. When she found out, she immediately quit as interim chief of the ER and Dr. Robert Romano jumped at the opportunity to become interim chief of the ER. At the start of Season 6, word spread that Romano might be up to the position as Chief of Staff, an event that both Kerry and Mark Greene resented and tried to prevent. However, in the end Kerry backed Dr. Romano for Chief of Staff and in return she was given the position of Chief of Emergency Medicine. This would be the first and last time Romano and Weaver completely agreed on administrative policy; in later seasons they were always involved in power struggles, despite both of them favoring administrative matters much more than the rest of the staff\n\nIn 1999, Weaver welcomed the chance to hire Dr. Gabe Lawrence (played by Alan Alda), who had been her mentor. She initially refused to accept Dr. Mark Greene's assertion that Lawrence was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease, but she ultimately faced facts and said goodbye to her role model.\n\nIn mid-season, Weaver fell in love with staff psychiatrist Kim Legaspi (played by Elizabeth Mitchell), but was afraid to admit it to Legaspi or herself. While Legaspi was openly lesbian and willing to pursue a romantic relationship with Weaver, she became frustrated that Weaver was not only in the closet, but also suffered from internalized homophobia and thus the relationship got off to a slow start. Once Weaver was able to admit to herself that she was gay, she was still uncomfortable about her coworkers finding out and the discriminatory consequences it might have on her career. This was despite their relationship becoming an \"open secret\" among most of the people in the ER.\n\nDuring that story, we also learned that Kerry had been married to a surgical resident before her career at County General started.\n\nThe first coworker Weaver came out to was Dr. Robert Romano, who planned to fire Legaspi over trumped up allegations that she sexually harassed a female patient. Weaver's act of courage kept Romano from firing Legaspi, but it also emotionally drained Weaver, whose fears of discrimination ruining her career resurfaced. She was therefore unable to provide emotional support to Legaspi, who kept her job, but at the cost of seeing the entrenched homophobia of the hospital administration and her own girlfriend, who remained in the closet. Legaspi broke up with Weaver and decided to take a job offer in San Francisco rather than face the homophobia from Romano or the lack of emotional support she received from Weaver.\n\nKerry also ran afoul of Elizabeth Corday in Season 7 when she had Mark Greene evaluated for professional competency after he showed noticeable personality changes after returning from brain tumor surgery. As a result, Kerry was not invited to Elizabeth and Mark's wedding, and while she and Mark seem to mend fences in Season 8, she and Elizabeth remained mostly unfriendly. Elizabeth sympathized and the two doctors were on better terms until Dr. Corday departed the show in Season 11. They were never close friends though. In fact, Elizabeth's departure came when she deliberately performed an illegal, life-saving transplant from an HIV+ donor into an HIV+ individual and did so in large part because she knew it would anger Kerry, leading Kerry to offer a demotion that Elizabeth declines before quitting.\n\nWeaver still had not come out to any of her coworkers except Romano and Luka Kovač. She was still quite anxious about anyone discovering her true status even though her sexual orientation was already known to some of her coworkers. Weaver did, however, begin a new relationship with firefighter Lt. Sandy Lopez (played by Lisa Vidal) whom she met in a rainstorm while trying to rescue a pregnant woman from a crashed ambulance. As the two became close, Lopez told Weaver she refused to date a woman who was in the closet. Lopez forcibly outed Weaver with a passionate kiss in front of her coworkers. What followed was a groundbreaking story for network television as the development of the romance between the two women was treated with the courtship, passion and arguments often reserved for heterosexual couples.\n\nLopez said, \"I did you a huge favor,\" after the kiss in the ER; a few episodes later, Weaver admitted to her that she was right. At the season's end, Weaver accepted herself as a lesbian, and became eager to combat homophobia wherever it appeared.\n\nIn Season Eight's second episode \"The Longer You Stay\", Weaver failed to answer repeated pages from Drs. Malucci & Chen when a patient being tended to by them had complications. Weaver was finally hauled in by Dr. Carter when he ran from the ER to get her personally from Doc Magoo's, sustaining a painful fall in the process. But after the patient died and she flatly said to the three \"you killed him\", she was seen back at Doc Magoo's where she found the pager she left in the bathroom stall.\n\nDesperate to cover up her irresponsibility when the hospital was sued by the patient's family, Weaver fired Malucci in the third episode \"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\" on a charge of misconduct, and by the fourth episode \"Never Say Never\", she pinned the malpractice on Malucci and Chen.\n\nIn \"Bygones\", Weaver was stunned when she realized a lonely young woman murdered her roommate because of unrequited love. She then reconciled with Lopez and the two of them made their first social appearance at an impromptu drinking party after Mark Greene died. Weaver was visibly saddened by Greene's death and broke down after hearing the news of his passing. She later told Sandy she knew his demise was coming but never thought it would affect her as deeply as it did. She realized she had lost a friend and regretted the years they spent in competition for various ER posts and promotions.\n\nWeaver and Lopez were still together and had on-going arguments about the future of their relationship. Weaver wanted to have a child, but after suffering a miscarriage felt Lopez should carry the child. Lopez, however, did not want to get pregnant, because it would impact her firefighting career. The couple did not get much screen time that season, and Weaver was given another story thread about the consequences she faced when she failed to report a local politician who tested positive for syphilis; Alderman Johnathan Bright provided funding for County and a plum position for Kerry, but forced her to do an off-the-record treatment of his closeted gay lover that ended with the lover's accidental death from an allergic reaction to penicillin. Later, Dr. Anspaugh became fed up with Dr. Romano's attitude and neglect on the job. Anspaugh offered to lighten Romano's work load by sharing his administrative duties with Kerry Weaver. When Romano refused this, he was replaced with a somewhat surprised Weaver, who offered Romano the Chief of Emergency Medicine position.\n\nKerry settled into her chief administrative position but ran into various challenges that arose day by day from hospital staffing to the ER's hectic renovation. These obstacles included her constant run-ins with Dr. Romano, whom at one point she threatens to fire. When he was killed in a helicopter accident, Kerry, like many others, was not saddened, though she acknowledged that his presence was an important contribution to the hospital. Later in early 2004, Weaver dedicated a Center of LGBT healthcare in the memory of Romano, which secretly served as post-mortem payback, since Romano was not a supporter of gay rights. In her personal life, Lopez changed her mind about having a baby and gave birth to baby Henry in the hospital. Later on in the season, however, Lopez died from injuries she suffered while fighting a fire; Kerry was devastated by the loss. Abby Lockhart and (surprisingly) Elizabeth Corday were particularly supportive towards her following this tragedy. Sandy's parents (who had never approved of her sexual orientation) took custody of Henry and for the remainder of the season, Weaver's storyline focused on a child custody battle between herself and Lopez's parents. The custody situation was eventually settled when the Lopezes and Weaver agreed to her having primary custody, with the Lopezes taking care of Henry while Kerry was at work.\n\nIn the 2005 episode titled \"Just As I Am,\" Weaver finally met her biological mother, Helen Kingsley, who turned out to be a conservative Christian, originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and currently living in Terre Haute, Indiana. Kingsley (Frances Fisher) explained to Weaver that, as an unmarried, teenage mother with limited options for raising a child, she gave Weaver up for adoption when she was 14 days old in hopes of her having a better life. She was in town for a Christ Crusade and decided to meet her daughter since Kerry's biological father, Cody Boone, had recently died. When Kingsley learned her daughter was a lesbian, she and Weaver clashed over faith and sexuality, with Weaver insisting that her mother love and accept her. Kingsley said she could love her daughter, but because she could not accept homosexuality as moral, she could not accept Weaver's lifestyle. This episode not only ended the mystery behind Weaver's mother, it also revealed for the first time the reason for Weaver's crutch: Helen inquired about Weaver's limp, and Weaver explained that she suffered from congenital hip dysplasia, a birth defect. Weaver was surprised to learn that Helen knew nothing about it, and her long-held fear that the birth defect was the reason she was given up for adoption was resolved.\n\nAside from this episode, Kerry Weaver almost exclusively played supporting roles and was frequently absent from entire episodes. A negative contribution was that she played a major role in forcing Elizabeth Corday to leave County, though Corday deliberately provoked her into doing so because she could not work with Lucien Dubenko, a new surgeon that Weaver had hired.\n\nKerry continued to play the background in most of the episodes this season. Even though she stayed very busy with her administrative meetings and tasks, Kerry occasionally took shifts in the ER to keep her emergency skills sharp. In the episode \"Out on a Limb\" Kerry finally underwent surgery to fix her hip dysplasia. In the episode \"No Place To Hide,\" Kerry walked for the first time on the series without the aid of her forearm crutch. Kerry asked Abby (who was expecting a child with Luka) to be Henry's legal guardian in the event that something happened to her, but her surgery was entirely successful. (Reportedly, this storyline was done, at least in part, because Laura Innes really was starting to develop hip and back problems after ten years of walking with a fake limp for the sake of her role.) Laura Innes described this arc as the character, \"Shedding some of her hardness and moving on in her life.\" \n\nAt the end of the season, Kerry faced criticism for hiring Dr. Victor Clemente (John Leguizamo) as an attending physician, who compromised patient care leading to possible liability and lawsuits to the hospital. Despite being responsible for hiring him (and for defending him against Luka's protests when Clemente began causing trouble), Kerry tried to divert the fire towards Dr. Luka Kovač (Goran Visnjic), the Chief of Emergency Medicine, risking his job as a result.\n\nAfter saving Luka and Abby in the season premiere, Kerry realized that her constant attempts to protect her career had cost her friendships; she owned up to her responsibility for the Clemente incident in order to save Luka from being fired. She was demoted from Chief of Staff as a result and was back to being an attending physician. Though she clearly struggled to adjust to her new position, especially with the current ER chief Luka Kovač now being her boss, Kerry was pleased to practice medicine full-time again; she also developed a more friendly relationship with Greg Pratt. Working back in the ER, Weaver caught the eye of a TV producer filming a news segment with Dr. Morris and literally steals the show. She's offered a job by the executives for news reporting. Shortly afterwards, Kerry and her producer Courtney (Michelle Hurd) developed a close relationship, one Kerry had not felt since her partner Sandy Lopez died. Courtney told Kerry how her great news broadcasting could open a successful career for her. Kerry decided to leave County General when ER chief Luka Kovač had to enact budget cuts and eliminate her position. Kerry accepted a television show offer at WTVJ in Miami, despite Kovač's last-minute efforts to convince her to stay.\n\nKerry Weaver's last regular appearance on \"ER\" was in the Season 13 episode called \"A House Divided\" Episode 280 in which Abby Lockhart expressed to Dr. Weaver that if it had not been for her, she'd never have become a doctor or a mother; she and Kerry shared a tearful farewell moment. As Kerry packed up and walked out of County General's doors for the last time, she only asked Luka to take care of the place for her and advised him not to make her mistake-getting involved in hospital politics, indicating that she forgave him. Luka took her advice and stepped down as Chief towards the end of the season, just before he married Abby.\n\nLaura Innes' last appearance as a series regular on the show was on January 11, 2007. Following her departure from the program, NBC received some pressure from GLAAD to introduce more LGBT characters.\n\nWeaver appeared in a flashback sequence in the Season 15 episode titled \"Heal Thyself\", which was set back in 2002, just months before Greene's death. In her scene, she walked into Trauma 1 and expressed how worried she was about Dr. Mark Greene, because of his fight with brain cancer. She told him to step down and take a break from treating Catherine Banfield's son. After he refused, Dr. Weaver reluctantly left the room.\n\nDuring the 15th and final season of \"ER\", at the end of the episode \"The Book of Abby,\" long-serving nurse Haleh Adams showed the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees had put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \"Weaver\" was seen.\n\nDuring Season 15 episode 19, former co-worker Dr. Doug Ross asked both Sam Taggart and Neela Rasgotra about Weaver (as he found out that they were from County), curious if she was still working there.\n\nIn the series finale, she flew from Florida to attend the dedication and opening of the Carter Center. She met up with Elizabeth Corday, Susan Lewis, John Carter, and Peter Benton after Carter's opening. The old colleagues went out to eat at an old tavern and catch up with each other. At the end of the night, she then told the group that she couldn't stay any longer, as she needed to catch a flight back to Florida. Kerry gave everyone a hug and left Chicago.\n"}

Cobalt is a very intense colouring agent and very little is required to show a noticeable amount of colour.\n\nCobalt glass plates are used as an optical filter in flame tests to filter out the undesired strong yellow light emitted by traces of sodium, and expand the ability to see violet and blue hues, similar to didymium glass.\n\nModerately ground cobalt glass (potassium cobalt silicate)—called \"smalt\"—has been historically important as a pigment in glassmaking, painting, pottery, for surface decoration of other types of glass and ceramics, and other media. The long history of its manufacture and use has been described comprehensively. Cobalt aluminate, also known as \"cobalt blue\", can be used in a similar way.\n\nCobalt glass such as Bristol blue glass is appreciated for its attractive colour and is popular with collectors. It is used in the distinctive blue bottles of Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry and Tŷ Nant mineral water.\n\nThe earliest known example of cobalt aluminate glass dates to a lump from about 2000 BC in ancient Mesopotamia, very possibly intended for use as a pigment; it was rare until the modern era. Cobalt oxide smalt appears as a pigment in Egyptian pottery about five centuries later, and soon after in the Aegean region, and this is the pigment normally known as \"smalt\". In paintings, smalt has a tendency to lose its color over a long period, and is little used today. However, when used in ceramics for underglaze decoration, it keeps its colour well, and is the main blue used in blue and white pottery from a wide range of dates and areas, including Chinese blue and white porcelain from the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Renaissance Italian maiolica and Delftware.\nChinese porcelain used smalt glazes from the Tang dynasty onwards, though Chinese cobalt glass is found from the Zhou dynasty (1122–221 BC). Cobalt was used as a pigment in Central Asia from the 13th century. A fragment of a mud painting in the ancient Tangut city of Khara-Khoto has been found to contain smalt, judged to be dated between the 11th and 13th centuries. A large quantity of smalt was purchased for the decoration of the gallery of Francis I of France at Fontainebleau in 1536. Smalt, normally now discoloured, is common in European paintings from the 15th to 17th centuries. For example, it is found in Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Sir William Butts (ca. 1540), in Michael Pacher's painting \"The Early Fathers' Altar\" (ca. 1483), and in the frescos of Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449–1494).\n\nThe invention of a European smalt process has traditionally been credited to a Bohemian glassmaker named Christoph Schürer, around 1540–1560. However, its presence in Dieric Bouts' \"The Entombment\" from circa 1455 proves that it was used at least a century earlier.\n\nThe process used for producing cobalt smalt glass at the Blaafarveværket industrial manufacturing center in Norway in the 19th century has been documented as smelting cobalt oxide together with quartz and potassium carbonate. The result was an intensely blue glass-like substance that was ground and sold to producers of glassware and porcelain.\n\n\n\n"}

Howard\n\nJames John Howard (July 24, 1927 – March 25, 1988) was an American educator and Democratic Party politician who represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1965 until his death from a heart attack in Washington, D.C. in 1988.\n\nHe was born on July 24, 1927 in Irvington, New Jersey. Howard graduated from St. Rose School, Belmar, in 1941, Asbury Park High School in 1947, St. Bonaventure University, in 1952; and earned a Master of Education degree from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in 1958.\n\nPrior to being elected to the House, Howard served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific from December 30, 1944, to July 19, 1946; teacher and acting principal in Wall Township school system from 1952 to 1964.\n\nElected as a Democrat to the Eighty-ninth and to the eleven succeeding Congresses and served from January 3, 1965, until his death from a heart attack in Washington, D.C., on March 25, 1988.\n\nOn May 23, 1967, Howard created a public controversy over the M16, the basic combat rifle in Vietnam, beginning after he read a letter to the House of Representatives in which a Marine in Vietnam claims that almost all Americans killed in the Battle of Hill 881 died as a result of their new M16 rifles jamming. By the end of 1967, the problem had been resolved.\n\nIn 1974, he introduced the idea of a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. And Congress soon imposed a nationwide 55 MPH (90 km/h) speed limit by threatening to withhold highway funds from states that did not adopt this limit. It was estimated a speed of used 17% less fuel per mile than a speed of 75 MPH (120 km/h). It was also believed, based on a noticeable drop the first year the limit was imposed, that it cut down on highway deaths, but later studies were more mixed on this point. In addition, Howard authored an innovative coordinated surface transportation policy and program. Howard's other notable, enduring contributions to the fight for enhanced highway safety include sponsorship of a myriad of bills such as: the Howard-Barnes anti-drunk driving legislation (1982); the Child Restraint Law (1984), which increased funding for state child passenger safety programs; legislation establishing a uniform minimum drinking age of 21 (1984); the National Driver's Register (1982); the National Infrastructure Act (1983); and the Motor Carrier Act (1980), which was the first regulatory reform of the trucking industry in half a century that, among other things, increased federal aid for truck safety programs.\n\nHoward served as chairman of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation (Ninety-seventh through One Hundredth Congresses).\n\nAt the time of his death, Howard was fighting an effort by transportation-related businesses move to persuade Congress to \"complete\" truck deregulation, a move they said would save billions in distribution costs. Upon his death the committee chairmanship passed to Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-CA).\n\nFrank Pallone filled the seat vacated by Howard's death in 1988.\n\nHoward was a resident of Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey, and was interred in St. Catharine's Cemetery in Sea Girt, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2299978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299978", "title": "The Clocks", "text": "The Clocks\n\nThe Clocks is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 7 November 1963 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. It features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings (16/-) and the US edition at $4.50.\n\nThe novel is notable for the fact that Poirot never visits any of the crime scenes or speaks to any of the witnesses or suspects. He is challenged to prove his claim that a crime can be solved by the exercise of the intellect alone. The novel marks the return of partial first-person narrative, a technique that Christie had largely abandoned earlier in the Poirot sequence but which she had employed in the previous Ariadne Oliver novel, \"The Pale Horse\" (1961). There are two interwoven plots: the mystery Poirot works on from his armchair while the police work on the spot, and a Cold War spy story told in the first person narrative.\n\nReviews at the time of publication found the writing up to Christie's par, but found negatives: the murder of a character about to add useful information was considered \"corny\" and \"unworthy\" of the author, and \"not as zestful\". In contrast, Barnard's review in 1990 said it was a \"lively, well-narrated, highly unlikely late specimen\" of Christie's writing. He loved the clocks at the start, and was oddly disappointed that they were red herrings.\n\nSheila Webb, a typist at Miss Martindale's agency, arrives at her afternoon appointment at Wilbraham Crescent in Crowdean, Sussex. She finds a well-dressed older man, stabbed to death, surrounded by six clocks, four of which are stopped at 4:13, while the cuckoo clock announces it is 3 o'clock. When a blind woman enters the house about to step on the corpse, Sheila runs screaming out of the house and into the arms of a young man passing down the street.\n\nThis man, Special Branch or MI5 agent Colin \"Lamb\", takes Sheila into his care. He is investigating a clue from a note found in a dead agent's pocket; letter M, number 61, and a sketch of a crescent moon written on a bit of hotel stationery (sketched in the book). At 19 Wilbraham Crescent, home of the blind Miss Pebmarsh, a police investigation begins into the murder. The dead man's business card proves false. His clothing reveals nothing else, as all labels have been removed. He was killed with an ordinary kitchen knife. Colin and Inspector Hardcastle interview the neighbours. Their homes adjoin the murder site on the street or from the back gardens in this unusually arranged Victorian housing development. Colin takes a liking to Sheila.\n\nHardcastle questions Mrs Lawton, the aunt who raised Rosemary Sheila Webb. Rosemary is the name on a clock found at the scene of the murder, but it disappeared before police gathered them up. Colin approaches Hercule Poirot, an old friend of his father, to investigate the case. He challenges Poirot to do so from his armchair. He gives Poirot detailed notes. Poirot accepts, then instructs Colin to talk further with the neighbours.\n\nAt the inquest, the medical examiner explains that chloral hydrate was given to the victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion at something said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but not the person he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street. She has been observing and recording the events at Wilbraham Crescent while confined to her room with a broken leg. She reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket of laundry on the morning of the murder. Colin tells Hardcastle.\n\nHardcastle tells Mrs Rival that her description of the deceased is not accurate. Upset, she calls the person who involved her in this case. Despite police watching her, she is found dead at Victoria tube station, stabbed in the back. Poirot's initial view of this case is that the appearance of complexity must conceal quite a simple murder. The clocks are a red herring, as is the presence of Sheila, and the removal of the dead man's wallet and tailor marks in the clothing. Colin updates Poirot on subsequent visits.\n\nAt a room in a Crowdean hotel, Poirot tells Inspector Hardcastle and Colin Lamb what he has deduced. From a careful chronology, he deduces what Edna realised. She returned early from lunch on the day of the murder because her shoe was broken, unnoticed by Miss Martindale, the owner. Miss Martindale \"took no telephone call\" at the time she claimed she had, and is the one person with motive to murder Edna. From that fictitious call, the boss sent Sheila to Miss Pebmarsh's house for steno/typing service. Miss Pebmarsh denies requesting this service. Mrs Bland, one of the neighbours, mentioned she had a sister in the initial interview with Hardcastle. Poirot deduced the identity of this sister as Miss Martindale. \n\nThe present Mrs Bland is the second Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living relative for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly they did not know she had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.\n\nThey murdered Mrs Rival before she could tell the police who hired her. Mr Bland and his sister-in-law thought their plan would baffle the police, while Mrs Bland felt she was a pawn in their schemes. Mr Bland disposed of Duguesclin's passport on a trip to Boulogne, which trip he mentioned to Colin in casual conversation. Poirot holds that people reveal much in simple conversation. Poirot had assumed this trip took place, so the man's passport would be found in a country different from where he was murdered, and long after friends and family in Canada had missed him on his holiday in Europe. The missing clock, with Rosemary written on it, was traced. Colin realises that Sheila had taken it and tossed it in the neighbour's dustbin, seeing it was her very own clock, mislaid on the way to a repair shop. But the clock was taken by Miss Martindale, not mislaid by Sheila. \n\nColin turns his note upside down, and it points him to 19 Wilbraham Crescent. Miss Pebmarsh is the centre of the ring passing information to the other side in the Cold War, using Braille to encode their messages. He has decided to marry Sheila and realises that Miss Pebmarsh is Sheila's mother, and thus his future mother-in-law. He gives her two hours warning of the net closing around her. She chose her cause over her child once, and does so again, clutching a small deadly knife. \"Lamb\" disarms her and the two wait for the arrest, both firm in their convictions. The novel closes with two letters from Inspector Hardcastle to Poirot, telling him police have found all the hard evidence to close the case. Mrs Bland, less ruthless than her sister, admitted all under questioning.\n\n\nFrancis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) reviewed the novel in \"The Guardian\"'s issue of 20 December 1963 when he said, \"I am not so sure. This begins well, with the discovery of a stranger in a suburban sitting-room, with four strange clocks all showing the same time; but thereafter the story, though as readable as ever, does tends to hang fire. Also there is one very corny item, the vital witness killed when on the point of disclosing crucial information, which is quite unworthy of Miss Christie.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson of \"The Observer\" (10 November 1963) concluded, \"Not as zestful as usual. Plenty of ingenuity about the timing, though.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Lively, well-narrated, highly unlikely late specimen – you have to accept two spies and three murderers living in one small-town crescent. The business of the clocks, fantastic and intriguing in itself, fizzles out miserably at the end. Contains (chapter 14) Poirot's considered reflections on other fictional detectives, and the various styles and national schools of crime writing.\"\n\n\nAn adaptation for the ITV television series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\", with David Suchet as Poirot, was produced for the show's twelfth season, aired in the UK in 2010. Guest stars include Tom Burke as Lieutenant Colin Race, Jaime Winstone as Sheila Webb, Lesley Sharp as Miss Martindale, and Anna Massey as Miss Pebmarsh; this was Massey's last performance, before her death, and the ITV broadcast of the episode is dedicated to her memory. Charles Palmer (who also directed \"Hallowe'en Party\" for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay being written by Stewart Harcourt (who also wrote the screenplay for \"Murder on the Orient Express\"). The adaptation was filmed on location in Dover, Dover Castle and St Margaret's Bay.\n\nFor the television adaptation, the setting was shifted from the Cold War era of the 1960s to the 1930s (keeping it in line with ITV's other adaptation of Poirot's cases set around the same decade), with a further change in location from Crowdean, Sussex, to Dover, Kent. Whilst the novel's main plot is retained, a number of significant changes were made by the adaptation, including a modification of the novel's sub-plot due to the change in setting:\n\n\n\nThe novel was first serialised in the UK weekly magazine \"Woman's Own\" in six abridged instalments from 9 November – 14 December 1963 with illustrations by Herb Tauss. It was advertised as being serialised prior to the publication of the book; however this had already appeared on 7 November. In the US a condensed version of the novel appeared in the January 1964 (Volume 156, Number 1) issue of \"Cosmopolitan\" with illustrations by Al Parker.\n\n"}

He batted and threw left-handed.\n\nFollowing the advice of Warren Spahn, Brewer developed a screwball to become one of the most successful relievers in the National League in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nA graduate of Broken Arrow Senior High in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Brewer compiled a 69–65 record with 810 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA in a 17-year career that began with the Cubs and ended with the Angels, and in between spent twelve seasons with the Dodgers.\n\nIn his career, Brewer recorded 132 saves, 125 with the Dodgers, appearing in 474 games for the club. Only two Dodgers pitchers, Don Sutton and Don Drysdale, have more appearances—550 and 518, respectively. As a Dodger, Brewer appeared in the 1973 All-Star Game and in three World Series (1965–66 and 1974). From 1968 to 1973 he averaged 20 saves a season, with a career-high 24 in 1970, and in 1972, he posted a 1.26 ERA, allowing only 4.7 hits per nine innings.\n\nBrewer was involved in an on-field altercation with Billy Martin on August 4, 1960. Brewer, then with the Cubs, brushed back Martin, then with the Cincinnati Reds, with a pitch in the second inning of a game at Wrigley Field. Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who picked it up and started to hand it to Martin as Martin approached. Martin punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone. Brewer was twice operated on for his injuries, and Martin served a five-day suspension. The Cubs and Brewer sued Martin for over $1 million for the loss of Brewer's services, but later dropped their case. Brewer, however, pursued his, and in 1969 a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 in damages.\n\nImmediately after his playing career, Brewer became pitching coach of the Montreal Expos, serving for three seasons (1977–79) on the staff of Baseball Hall of Fame manager Dick Williams.

Miss Marple looks up to see why and spots several people nearby.\n\nThe next day, when the maid Victoria finds Major Palgrave dead in his room, Miss Marple is convinced he was murdered. She asks Dr Grahame to find the photo he mentioned, pretending it is of her nephew. Meanwhile, she interviews the others: Tim and Molly Kendal, owners of the hotel; the Prescotts, a clergyman and his sister; Mr Jason Rafiel, a tycoon confined to a wheelchair; Jackson, his nurse/masseur/attendant/valet; Esther Walters, his secretary; the American Lucky Dyson and her husband, Greg; and Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon. On the beach, Miss Marple sees Señora de Caspearo, a woman on holiday who says she remembers Major Palgrave because he had an evil eye. Miss Marple corrects her that he had a glass eye, but she still says that it was evil.\n\nVictoria informs the Kendals that she did not remember seeing the high blood pressure medication, Serenite, in Major Palgrave's room before his death, although it was found on his table after his death. That night, Victoria is found stabbed to death. Molly begins having nightmares. Miss Marple finds Jackson looking at Molly's cosmetics who says that if belladonna were added to it, it would cause nightmares. The following night, Tim finds Molly unconscious on the floor, apparently having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. The police are involved, and the cook, Enrico, tells them he saw Molly holding a steak knife before going outside. Miss Marple asks the others if Major Palgrave told people about the photo. Others claim Palgrave said it was not a photo of a wife killer but a husband killer. Major Palgrave is exhumed and the autopsy reveals that he was poisoned.\n\nAt night, Tim wakes up to find his wife is missing. They find what seems to be her body in a creek, but it turns out to be Lucky; the two women resemble one another. Miss Marple wakes Mr Rafiel and they go to Tim and Molly Kendal's house. There they find Tim offering Molly some wine. Miss Marple tells Jackson to take the wine away. She shows it to Mr Rafiel, saying there is a deadly narcotic in it. She explains that Tim is the wife killer, recognised by Major Palgrave. Miss Marple had thought Palgrave saw the Hillingdons and the Dysons on his right as they were coming up the beach, but later realised that he had a glass eye on the right so he could not have seen them. Tim and Molly were sitting on his left. Tim was planning to kill his wife and so had to kill Major Palgrave when he recognised him. He also killed Victoria, who remembered the Serenite. Tim put belladonna in Molly's cosmetics to make her appear mad to the others. Tim had asked his wife to meet him by the creek, but Molly had been distracted by a vision due to the belladonna and wandered off. Tim saw Lucky and mistook her for Molly. He was about to poison Molly when Miss Marple came in.\n\nEsther Walters suddenly insists that Tim is not a killer. Tim shouts at her to keep quiet. He had been planning to marry Esther, after Molly's death, because he had heard that she was going to inherit a large sum of money from Jason Rafiel.\n\nMiss Marple: An elderly spinster detective with an eye for detail and unexpected clues, with a \"mind like a sink\". She is sent on a Caribbean holiday by her nephew.\n\nMajor Palgrave: An elderly, garrulous man with a glass eye who tells stories from past, some of which stories have photographs or news clips to illustrate them.\n\nTim Kendal: A man in his thirties married to Molly Kendal, who marries her using false references and starts the hotel with her, using her money.\n\nMolly Kendal: Tim's pretty young wife who starts the hotel where the story takes place with him. She eventually believes she has fallen mentally ill and confides it to Evelyn, although her symptoms are the result of being poisoned.\n\nJason Rafiel: A cantankerous old man with a large fortune and an unexpectedly kind spirit, who takes a shine to Miss Marple.\n\nEsther Walters: Jason Rafiel's secretary, (the widow of a poor provider) with a child at school in England.\n\nVictoria: A St Honoré native who is the one to discover Major Palgrave's death and the mysterious bottle of Serenite. She has a common-law marriage with two children and is the second victim to be killed.\n\nGreg Dyson: A nature lover, who is now married to Lucky, his second wife.\n\nLucky Dyson: An attractive American woman who is married to Greg. She had plotted to kill his first wife, along with Edward Hillingdon, whom she tricked into guilt for his actions, and then seduced. She is the third murder victim.\n\nEdward Hillingdon: The husband of Evelyn and an avid nature lover. He has children at a boarding school and has an affair with Lucky.\n\nEvelyn Hillingdon: A woman who does not love her husband Edward but stays with him both for their public image and for their children.\n\nSeñora de Caspearo: A South American woman on holiday who opposes ugliness and, therefore Major Palgrave and Jason Rafiel. She remarks on Major Palgrave's glass eye as an evil eye.\n\nMiss Prescott: An elderly woman who enjoys gossiping and has come on holiday with her brother, Canon Prescott.\n\nCanon Prescott: Miss Prescott's brother, a member of the clergy, who dislikes his sister's gossiping.\n\nDr Grahame: The St Honoré doctor, slowly retiring from practice, who treats Miss Marple who pretends to be ill, cares for Molly and confirms the deaths of the murdered people.\n\nJackson: Mr Rafiel's valet/masseur/attendant who (by admission to Miss Marple) worked at a cosmetic company.\n\nAfter lukewarm reviews of her two previous novels, Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) felt that the writer was back on form in his review in \"The Guardian\"'s issue of 11 December 1964: \"Mrs Agatha Christie has done it again. In \"A Caribbean Mystery\" she tells the reader explicitly what is going to happen; and yet when it does, nine out of ten will be taken completely by surprise – as I was. How \"does\" she do it? For the rest, it is Miss Marple this time who is in charge of the story; and all one can guess is that the setting is a Caribbean island.\"\n\nMaurice Richardson in \"The Observer\" of 15 November 1964 began, \"A most encouraging return to somewhere very near her best unputdownable form. ... Suspicion nicely distributed among guests, many of them raffish adulterers. Not very hard to guess, but quite suspenseful. Good varied characterisation including a particularly excellent octogenarian tycoon.\" Towards the end of the year, Richardson again commented on the book in a special \"Books of the Year: A Personal Choice\" column when he said, \"Agatha Christie makes one of those gratifying veteran's comebacks.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" of 21 November 1964 wrote: \"Not quite at the top of her form. A Miss Marples (sic) story which addicts won't find as unsolvable as usual.\"\n\nRobert Barnard said of this novel, that it was \"In the tradition of all those package-tour mysteries written by indigent crime writers who have to capitalize on their meagre holidays. Nothing much of interest, but useful for illustrating the 'fluffification' of Miss Marple. Reuses a ploy from \"Appointment with Death\".\"\n\n\"There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie.\" — \"Sunday Times\"\n\n\"Throws off the false clues and misleading events as only a master of the art can do.\" \"The New York Times\"\n\nThe novel is dedicated to John Cruikshank Rose, \"with happy memories of my visit to the West Indies\". Christie and her husband Max Mallowan became friends with John Rose in 1928 at the archaeological site at Ur. He was the architectural draftsman and when Max was in charge of the dig at Arpachiyah, Syria in 1932, he hired Rose to be his draftsman. Rose was Scottish, and as Christie described him, \"a beautiful draughtsman, with a quiet way of talking, and a gentle humour that I found irresistible.\"\n\nThe millionaire Jason Rafiel appears again, posthumously, in the novel \"Nemesis\" where he sends Miss Marple on a case specifically because of her success in solving the events related in \"A Caribbean Mystery\".\n\nA 1983 US TV movie adaptation starred Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Barnard Hughes as Mr Rafiel. \"The New York Times\" says that Miss Marple has \"a carload of suspects\" to figure out why her friend was killed, in this film that first aired 22 October 1983. The screenplay was credited to Sue Grafton, later a mystery writer, and Steve Humphrey.\n\nA BBC TV adaptation starring Joan Hickson was shown in 1989 as part of the series \"Agatha Christie's Miss Marple\", with Donald Pleasence co-starring as Mr Rafiel. Few changes were made from the novel: the Prescotts and Señora de Caspearo were omitted, Miss Marple holidayed on Barbados rather than the fictional island of \"St Honoré\" (the name Honoré reappears as the fictional main town in the BBC series \"Death in Paradise\" that began airing in 2011), and the blood pressure medication was renamed Tetrauwolfide. The production was made and aired after the production of \"Nemesis\", leading to some viewer confusion. In the earlier production, the part of Jason Rafiel was portrayed by Frank Gatliff, rather than Donald Pleasence.\n\nIn 2013, the book was adapted for the sixth series of ITV's \"Agatha Christie's Marple\", starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple and co-starring Antony Sher as Jason Rafiel, Oliver Ford Davies as Major Palgrave, and Robert Webb and Charity Wakefield as the Kendalls. The characters are much the same as in the novel, and the location is the same. At the end, Tim tries to shoot Molly rather than poison her, but the gun's bullets have been replaced with blanks. Like other episodes in the previous series, it includes characters based on real persons. One is fledgling novelist Ian Fleming, who needs a name for his spy hero. The other is ornithologist James Bond (Charlie Higson), who begins a lecture to his fellow guests by introducing himself as \"...Bond, James Bond\", which solves Fleming's problem. (Fleming, who was an avid bird-watcher, did take the name from the ornithologist, though they had not met.)\n\nAs with the Joan Hickson versions, \"Nemesis\" was filmed prior to \"A Caribbean Mystery\". There are some continuity issues: in the 2009 version of \"Nemesis\", Jason Rafiel is a German writer, but in \"A Caribbean Mystery\", he is an English chemical manufacturer. Miss Marple does not refer to herself as \"Nemesis\" at any time in this story, despite herself and Mr Rafiel associating the name with her in \"Nemesis\". Just like in the Joan Hickson versions, Mr Rafiel is portrayed by different actors: Antony Sher portrays him here, but in \"Nemesis\", he makes voice appearances by Herbert Lom (who previously appeared in the 2004 version of \"The Murder at the Vicarage\" as Monsieur Dufosse).\n\nThe 1989 version is the only adaptation as of 2017 to actually be shot in the Caribbean (on location on the island of Barbados); the 1983 TV movie was shot in California, while the 2013 version was filmed in Cape Town.\n\n\nThe novel was serialised in the \"Star Weekly Novel\", a Toronto newspaper supplement, in two abridged instalments from 16 to 23 January 1965, with each issue containing an uncredited cover illustration.\n\n"}

Marketing Displays, Inc.\n\nTrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court decision in the area of trademark law, holding that a functional design could not be trademarked, and that a patented design was presumed to be functional.\n\nThe plaintiff, Marketing Display, Inc., held patents (, ) on a two-spring design to keep traffic signs standing in strong winds. After the plaintiff's patents expired, the defendant, TrafFix Devices, Inc., began manufacturing their own signs using the design. The plaintiff sued for trade dress infringement based on copying of the recognizable design. The issue the Courts dealt with concerned the legal question of whether trade dress protection could apply to the subject of an expired patent.\n\nThe Court, in a unanimous opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that there can be no trademark protection for something that is functional because that would work as a detriment to competitors based on something other than reputation, which is the key consideration in trademark law.\n\nThe Court noted that the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the characteristic for which protection is sought is not functional—but having a patent for a design raises a very strong presumption that the design was functional. A design is functional if it serves any purpose that makes the product work better, or makes the product less expensive to produce. That an alternative design is available does not undercut the functionality of a given design.Discussing trademarks, we have said “ ‘[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,’ and cannot serve as a trademark, ‘if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.’ ”. Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we have observed that a functional feature is one the “exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.” . . . Where the design is functional under the \"Inwood\" formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature. Here, Justice Kennedy said, the design was clearly functional, and the plaintiff could not carry the burden of proving otherwise because the very characteristic that is sought to be protected by trademark is the one whose functionality was previously sought to be covered by patent.\n\n"}

The special suffered low ratings and it was cancelled. It featured five pastel-colored, or \"fluppy\", talking dogs that came through a fluppy interdimensional doorway and into the lives of Jamie and his teenage neighbor Claire. The dogs were the intended prey of the evil miser Wagstaff. Animation was supplied by TMS Entertainment, who had previously been contracted by Disney on another current running animated series, \"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears\".\n\nThe basic premise for the series, akin to the much later live-action sci-fi series \"Sliders\", was the story of a band of adventurous, cuddly, dog-like creatures called Fluppies who use a crystal key to open inter-dimensional doorways. They are on a mountain of one world in perilous weather, and use the crystal key to escape, ending up in a jungle world the Fluppies are chased by a big purple dinosaur-like creature, they find another portal and escape into a supermarket on Earth.\n\nMistaken for regular dogs, they are captured and placed in a pound. However, prior to their capture, one of the Fluppies was seen shouting to the others which was noticed by J.J. Wagstaff, a ruthless businessman. As their only means of escape, Stanley, the leader of the Fluppies, manages to get a woman to pick him as a pet for her son, Jamie; he plans to eventually return to the pound to free the others. Jamie is disappointed at this new dog, which is smaller than he hoped, but he takes him for a walk. Taking the opportunity, Stanley escapes his leash and makes a break for it, but Jamie pursues him so as to not anger his mother for losing his new pet so soon. Unfortunately, the chase leads to a construction site and Jamie finds himself in danger, forcing Stanley to reveal his intelligence and humanoid nature to save him. Meanwhile, Wagstaff, whose mansion is filled with hunting trophies and live exotic animals, sees in an old book the talking dogs he'd seen earlier; they are identified as Fluppies. Wagstaff vows to add the Fluppies to his menagerie.\n\nNow with a secret, Stanley explains the situation and Jamie offers to help. Unfortunately, the boy only has enough money to purchase one of Stanley's compatriots, Tippi, and his mother won't let him keep her. Fortunately, Jaimie's neighbour Claire eagerly agrees to take her in. That night, as Jamie and Stanley sleep, the boy reflexively scratches the Fluppy's head, which causes their bed to fly. Once they awaken and learn how to control the flying effect, Stanley resolves to break his compatriots out that night and pick up Tippi to do so, inadvertently revealing their nature to Claire in the process. At the pound, Stanley and Tippi manage to free their friends and barely avoid Wagstaff, who had the pound opened to seize them.\n\nThe next day, the Fluppies depart to find another dimensional portal, but they need Jamie's help. He leaves school to aid them. This portal turns out to lead to a water world, and the company are flooded out and have to return to Jamie's home to dry out. Hiding in the basement, the Fluppies discover another portal inside that very house, but opening it releases a large rambunctious creature that runs about, throwing Jamie's home into a shambles before they can bring it under control. Although the gang manages to put the house in order before Jamie's mother comes home from work, she gets news that Jamie cut school. Angry at her son for playing hooky, she asks a lot of questions, which Jamie concocts a long story whilst the Fluppies clandestinely keep the alien creature pacified in the basement by feeding it flowers.\n\nHoping to avoid ruining Jamie's life any more, some of the Fluppies continue their search on their own while Stanley and Tippi keep the alien creature hidden in the basement. The venturing Fluppies come to a library and finally locate the portal to their home world. Unfortunately, while they are returning to tell the other Fluppies the great news, Wagstaff captures Ozzie, forcing Stanley and Tippi to ask for Claire's help. Jamie sees them depart in Claire's car as he and the youngest Fluppies ride on the creature in pursuit. Unfortunately, Wagstaff has been expecting this and manages to capture Stanley and Tippi in his home and threatens to call the police on the children for breaking and entering.\n\nWith a desperate plan, the Fluppies convince Wagstaff to let the children \"say goodbye\" and signals them to scratch on all their heads. The combined strength of this magic tears the entire section of Wagstaff's house into the air. As the occupants struggle to keep their footing with the violent jostling, the Fluppies reach the portal at the front of the library and they crash land the building in front of it. As they struggle to open this portal, which enters into the Fluppies' home dimension, Wagstaff and his butler find themselves knocked inside by the creature while Stanley's company bolts to safety. Before Wagstaff and his butler can exit, the door closes permanently, leaving Jamie and Claire alone in their own reality.\n\nMonths later in winter, Jamie and Claire have grown to be close friends after this extraordinary adventure, but they miss the Fluppies dearly. However, Stanley suddenly appears, saying that adventure is an important part of life. His fellow Fluppies appear saying they missed Claire and Jamie, and Stanley reveals that he has found a way to stabilize the portal between his homeworld and Earth. Hundreds of Fluppies line up to pass through the portal, eager to tour Earth.\n\nSome of the characters in the Fluppy Dogs and the voice actors that played them were:\n\n\nWhile she may have been intended for the series, Fanci, an additional pink Fluppy Dog, was not featured in the pilot. The Fluppy Dogs merchandise (including dolls, coloring books and puzzles) released in the 1980s featured images based on a children's book which included Fanci, and which were apparently based on preliminary designs for the Fluppies. These were slightly different from the designs that appeared in the actual pilot film. Based on these designs, it would appear that the Fluppy Dogs were originally targeted to young girls, and by the time it reached post-production, the focus was changed dramatically, but it was not enough to form a concrete target audience, which might explain its failure to become a regular series.\n\nIn the book, the Fluppy Dogs are as follows: Fanci Flup (pink/white with a pink hairbow), Cuddle Flup (purple/white with two purple hairbows), Brave Flup (blue/white with a plaid bandana), Cool Flup (green/white with sunglasses), Shy Flup (peach/white with a flowered hat), and Silly Flup (yellow/white with two yellow hairbows).\n\nThe \"Fluppy Dogs\" special made its debut on the U.S. television network ABC during the thanksgiving turkey feast, on November 27, 1986, pre-empting \"We Are One World\". It scored a Nielsen rating of 5.3/10; placing 70th among network programming, it was the week's lowest-ranked ABC film.\n\n\n"}
