She is the elder of two daughters. Her mother was a school teacher, and her father owned and operated a small realty business in Ventura. As a teenager, she studied ballet, acted in school plays, sang in the Baptist choir, and was vice president of the student body her senior year. She graduated from Ventura High School in 1959. She attended H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College (Tulane University, 1959–60) and then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley. She graduated with BA degrees in 1965 in English and in Dramatic Art. She received a Fulbright Fellowship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in London. She apprenticed at the Actor's Workshop of San Francisco in 1961-62.\n\nAfter summers at the Stanford Contemporary Workshop playing leads and two summers at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival playing classical roles, her first professional engagement was a season at the Front Street Theatre, Memphis, TN. upon return from London. While living in New York City, she worked at resident and stock theatres throughout the country, also appearing on PBS in original works and on networks in three soap operas. She made her Broadway debut in the short-lived 1968 play \"The Gingham Dog\". Grassle played in \"Butterflies Are Free\" on Broadway (as stand-by with Gloria Swanson, Rosemary Murphy, etc.) as well as at the Elitch Theatre in Denver, Colorado, in June 1972, along with Maureen O'Sullivan and Brandon deWilde, who was killed before leaving town after the performances ended.Grassle starred in the Shakespeare in the Park \"Cymbeline.\" with Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, and Bill Devane.\n\nGrassle auditioned for the role of the mother, Caroline Ingalls, in the \"Little House on the Prairie\" TV series and won the part. The series ran for nine seasons, from 1974 to 1983. After making the pilot for \"Little House on the Prairie,\" Grassle appeared in one episode of \"Gunsmoke\" titled \"The Wiving\" as Fran, one of several saloon girls kidnapped. Subsequently, she acted in the features \"Wyatt Earp\"\",\" starring Kevin Costner, in 1994. and \"Harry's War\", a 1981 American film. She played Kathy, the wife of Edward Herrmann's title character. On television, she starred in and co-wrote the NBC-TV film \"Battered.\" Other TV movies include \"Cocaine: One Man's Seduction,\" \"Crisis in MidAir,\" and \"Between the Darkness and the Dawn\". In episodic TV, she starred in \"Hotel,\" \"Love Boat\", and \"Murder She Wrote\" (twice.) She also appeared on \"Hollywood Squares\" and numerous talk shows such as \"Dinah,\" \"Merv Griffin,\" \"Mike Douglas,\" and \"John Davidson.\" During this period, she lobbied for federal funding for shelters for battered women and appeared in many events to support the Equal Rights Amendment. \n\nAfter the series ended, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and became co-founder and artistic director of Santa Fe’s Resource Theater Company. Later she moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where she performed with the company of actors at Actors Theatre of Louisville.\n\nGrassle continues to perform in productions in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Palo Alto as well as tours and productions such as \"Driving Miss Daisy\" in the starring role of Miss Daisy at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in a co-production with Rubicon Theatre and at the Riverside Center for the Performing Arts in Fredericksburg, Virginia. In 2008, she was awarded a prize for her performance in \"Cabaret\" at the San Francisco Playhouse. Over the years, she has appeared in commercials such as the promotional face for Premier Bathrooms, a supplier of bathing products for the elderly and infirm.\n\nTeaching\n\nDirecting\n\n"}
{"id": "1811292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811292", "title": "Functional selectivity", "text": "Functional selectivity\n\nFunctional selectivity (or “agonist trafficking”, “biased agonism”, “biased signalling”, \"ligand bias\" and “differential engagement”) is the ligand-dependent selectivity for certain signal transduction pathways relative to a reference ligand (often the endogenous hormone or peptide) at the same receptor. Functional selectivity can be present when a receptor has several possible signal transduction pathways. To which degree each pathway is activated thus depends on which ligand binds to the receptor. Functional selectivity, or biased signalling, is most extensively characterized at G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A number of biased agonists, such as those at muscarinic M2 receptors tested as analgesics or antiproliferative drugs, or those at opioid receptors that mediate pain, show potential at various receptor families to increase beneficial properties while reducing side effects. For example, pre-clinical studies with G protein biased agonists at the mu opioid receptor show equivalent efficacy for treating pain with reduced risk for addictive potential and respiratory depression. Studies within the chemokine receptor system also suggest that GPCR biased agonism is physiologically relevant. For example, a beta-arrestin biased agonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 induced greater chemotaxis of T cells relative to a G protein biased agonist.\n\nFunctional selectivity has been proposed to broaden conventional definitions of pharmacology.\n\nTraditional pharmacology posits that a ligand can be either classified as an agonist (full or partial), antagonist or more recently an inverse agonist through a specific receptor subtype, and that this characteristic will be consistent with all effector (second messenger) systems coupled to that receptor. While this dogma has been the backbone of ligand-receptor interactions for decades now, more recent data indicates that this classic definition of ligand-protein associations does not hold true for a number of compounds; such compounds may be termed as mixed agonist-antagonists.\n\nFunctional selectivity posits that a ligand may inherently produce a mix of the classic characteristics through a single receptor isoform depending on the effector pathway coupled to that receptor. For instance, a ligand can not easily be classified as an agonist or antagonist, because it can be a little of both, depending on its preferred signal transduction pathways. Thus, such ligands must instead be classified on the basis of their individual effects in the cell, instead of being either an agonist or antagonist to a receptor.\n\nIt is also important to note that these observations were made in a number of different expression systems and therefore functional selectivity is not just an epiphenomenon of one particular expression system.\n\nOne notable example of functional selectivity occurs with the 5-HT receptor, as well as the 5-HT receptor. Serotonin, the main endogenous ligand of 5-HT receptors, is a functionally selective agonist at this receptor, activating phospholipase C (which leads to inositol triphosphate accumulation), but does not activate phospholipase A2, which would result in arachidonic acid signalling. However, the other endogenous compound dimethyltryptamine activates arachidonic acid signaling at the 5-HT receptor, as do many exogenous hallucinogens such as DOB and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Notably, LSD does not activate IP signaling through this receptor to any significant extent. Oligomers; specifically 5-HT– heteromers mediate this effect. This may explain why some direct 5-HT receptor agonists have psychedelic effects, whereas compounds that indirectly increase serotonin signalling at the 5-HT receptors, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), generally do not; nor do 5HT receptor agonists without constitutive activity at the mGluR dimer, such as lisuride.\n\nTianeptine, an atypical antidepressant, is thought to exhibit functional selectivity at the μ-opioid receptor to mediate its antidepressant effects.\n\nOliceridine is a mu opioid receptor biased agonist that is functionally selective reported to mediate pain relief without tolerance nor gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nThe delta opioid receptor agonists SNC80 and ARM390 demonstrate functional selectivity that is thought to be due to their differing capacity to cause receptor internalization. While SNC80 causes delta opioid receptors to internalize, ARM390 causes very little receptor internalization. Functionally, that means that the effects of SNC80 (e.g. analgesia) do not occur when a subsequent dose follows the first, whereas the effects of ARM390 persist. However, tolerance to ARM390's analgesia still occurs eventually after multiple doses, though through a mechanism that does not involve receptor internalization. Interestingly, the other effects of ARM390 (e.g. decreased anxiety) persist after tolerance to its analgesic effects has occurred.\n\n\n"}

They held the seat from its creation in 1950 until the death in 1981 of Sir Graham Page. The resulting by-election was notable as it was won by Shirley Williams, one of the \"gang of four\" senior members of the Labour Party who had founded the new Social Democratic Party (SDP), becoming the first SDP member to be elected. However, Williams lost the seat to the Conservative candidate Malcolm Thornton at the 1983 general election.\n\nThornton held the seat until the 1997 election, when he lost to Labour's Claire Curtis-Thomas who held the seat until its abolition.

It was replaced by the new Sefton Central seat, which includes parts of the former Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency. As a result, Formby and Little Altcar are part of the new Sefton Central constituency and the town of Crosby has been divided between two constituencies, with the two electoral wards of southern Crosby, Church and Victoria, containing the urbanised bulk of the town which includes the areas of Great Crosby, Waterloo and Seaforth, being absorbed into the expanded Bootle constituency, represented by the Labour MP Joe Benton, and the two electoral wards of northern Crosby, Blundellsands and Manor, which contains residential suburban areas such as, Blundellsands, Brighton-Le-Sands, Little Crosby, Thornton, and Hightown, forming part of the new Sefton Central constituency represented by Bill Esterson, also a Labour MP.\n\n"}

It is located near the small community of Thayer in Jones Township, Union County. This site is now part of the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. It is the birthplace of Helaman Pratt. The address of the memorial is 1704 Mount Pisgah Road in Thayer.\n\nAfter the 1844 death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, most members of the Church aligned themselves with Brigham Young and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Under Young's leadership, about 13,000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo, Illinois set out to find a new home in the West. On May 18, 1846, Nauvoo exiles established a permanent camp and resting place on the middle fork (Twelve-Mile Creek) of the Grand River on Potawatomi Indian land. The site was selected and named \"Mount Pisgah\" by LDS apostle Parley P. Pratt, who, when he first saw the modest hill, was reminded of the biblical Pisgah (Deuteronomy 3:27) where Moses viewed the Promised Land.\n\nPratt's brother, Orson, wrote: \"We concluded to form another settlement here, for the benefit of the poor, and such as were unable, for the want of teams, to proceed further. Accordingly, the camp commenced building houses, ploughing, planting, and fencing in farms, an immense quantity of labor was performed in a very few days.\" To the west of the rise, they built cabins and planted several thousand acres with peas, cucumbers, beans, corn, buckwheat, potatoes, pumpkins, and squash.\n\nLDS emigrants considered the area rich in agricultural promise, although food was very scarce during the early years and illness was common. At its height, the community had over 2,000 inhabitants, but generally averaged about 700 Latter-day Saints. It was there that the U.S. Army first called upon the Latter-day Saints to furnish volunteers to serve in the Mexican–American War. This military group became known as the Mormon Battalion. The LDS settlers maintained a vital settlement until 1852. As the need to supply and support Mormon pioneer companies waned in the region, Mount Pisgah's residents sold their land and improvements to other American frontiersmen and moved on to Latter-day Saint settlements in Utah and surrounding areas.\n\nThe site of Mount Pisgah is now marked by a Mount Pisgah Cemetery State Preserve, which contains exhibits, historical markers, and a reconstructed log cabin. However, little remains from the 19th century except a cemetery memorializing the 300 to 800 emigrants who died while passing through or residing in the community.\n\n\n"}

He later went on to design and manufacture Puffing Billy in 1813, two years before George Stephenson produced his first locomotive Blücher. Christopher Blackett as lord of the manor in the first 30 years of the 19th century provided the entrepreneurial drive that encouraged these engineers.\nOnce an industrial workplace with collieries and an ironworks, it is now a commuting village for Newcastle upon Tyne and Hexham, served by the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway.\n\nThe earliest reference to Wylam is in a record of 1158 that records that the settlement belonged to the priory at Tynemouth. It is thought that Guy de Balliol, Lord of Bywell, gave Wylam to the priory in 1085. The Priors of Tynemouth held lands in the village until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.\n\nThe Blackett family have had a long association with the village. In 1659 Christopher Blackett acquired the Lordship of the Manor of Wylam on the death of his wife's father, Thomas Fenwick. Following Christopher's death, his second son, John Blackett, took over the estate and purchased additional land in the area, including two farms at Wylam bought in 1685. These farms formed a modest estate and residence for the Blackett family until the third quarter of the 20th century. The Lordship also included mineral rights within the township. This allowed the family to develop the colliery and further increase their prosperity.\n\nAn article in the \"Newcastle Courant\" of 17 January 1874 entitled \"\"Our Colliery Villages\"\" paints an unattractive image of the village – 'Wylam is the very worst colliery village that we have yet beheld …'. The colliery has an important place in the history of the development of the locomotive. It is thought that the Wylam waggonway was opened in 1748 and was therefore one of the earliest waggonways in the North of England. The waggonway linked the colliery to the staiths at Lemington from where the coal was taken down the River Tyne on flat bottomed boats called keels to be loaded on the large coal ships further down the river.\n\nSeveral famous engineers have also had links with the village. George Stephenson was born at a small cottage at Wylam in June 1781. Timothy Hackworth's father was foreman blacksmith at the colliery and his son was born in the village in December 1786. Hackworth together with William Hedley and Jonathan Forster were involved in the development of the locomotive engine at the colliery. Perhaps the most famous of the engines to be developed was the Puffing Billy, which is now housed at The Science Museum in London, followed closely by Wylam Dilly which is on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nThe late 18th century was a period of prosperity for the village – the colliery was thriving and an ironworks, a leadshot manufactury and a brewery were all established in the village. In 1864 the ironworks closed. Four years later the colliery was closed. The brewery ceased to operate sometime in the 1870s. This decline in the industry led to a change in the character of the village. By the 20th century the village was almost entirely a residential settlement.\n\nWylam has approximately 800 households, with a population of 2,100.\n\nWylam is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Guy Opperman of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament.\n\nPrior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North East England constituency.\n\nFor Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority.\n\nThe area surrounding the village is officially known as Wylam Civil Parish.\n\nWylam Winter Tales is a not-for-profit arts and culture festival held in the village every January/February. It features a week of varied events including music, storytelling, film, crafts and history at venues throughout the village. It is funded through small grants, donations and ticket sales and is run by volunteers.\n\nWylam is located on the north and south sides of the River Tyne, in Northumberland, England. The riverside walks and country trails surrounding the village are popular for cyclists, runners and walkers alike and the view of Wylam Bridge from Wylam Wood Road towards the southwest is especially dramatic.\n\nTo the east of Wylam railway station is the mouth of the small brook known as Stanley Burn, which originates in the southern Prudhoe area and also forms the regional border between Northumberland to the west and the borough of Gateshead (Tyne and Wear). The traditional boundary between Northumberland and County Durham follows the River Tyne from this point.\n\nWylam Railway Bridge (also known as Points Bridge and the Half Moon bridge) is located at Hagg Bank, approximately west of the town. It is a wrought iron bridge built by the Scotswood, Newburn and Wylam Railway Company in 1876 to link the North Wylam Loop with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway.\n\nThe original plan had been to build a bridge with four spans resting on three piers on the river bed. This was rejected by the local coal companies who feared that the construction of the piers on the river bed would disturb the shallow mine workings below, which already suffered from flooding.\n\nThe designers found the solution in designing a single-span bridge carrying a double track, without the need for piers. The bridge consists of three parallel wrought iron arches resting on abutments on each bank, with the twin rail decks suspended by 14 wrought iron drop bars. It cost £16,000 to build. The bridge paved the way for new developments in bridge building – Newcastle's Tyne Bridge in 1928 and Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, being direct descendants of the design and construction of Hagg's Bridge.\n\nMany of the trains which used the bridge carried coal from the collieries at Newburn and Walbottle westwards to Carlisle.\n\nThe line was closed in 1968 and the bridge later purchased by Northumberland County Council. It was restored in 1997 with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. All the old lead-based paint was removed, requiring the bridge to be wrapped in plastic to prevent polluting the river.\n\nThe war memorial, which is a cross about in height, stands by the roadside just to the north of Wylam Bridge. The inscriptions and names on the war memorial have been transcribed and published by the North East War Memorials Project.\n\nUnusually for a rural area, transport in Wylam is mainly Rail and cycle orientated.\n\nRailway\nThe village is served by Wylam railway station on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, also known as the Tyne Valley Line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in Northumberland with Carlisle in Cumberland. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland. Passenger services on the line are operated by Northern and Abellio ScotRail. The line is also heavily used for goods.\n\nThe railway station is on the south bank of the River Tyne. There used to be another railway station in Wylam on the north bank of the river, which was part of the Scotswood, Newburn and Wylam Railway. The line has now closed and the tracks removed, with the North Wylam railway station area now being used as a car park.\n\nBus\nThe bus service to and from Wylam is poor and many services have been discontinued over the years. There is an hourly service to Newcastle and Hexham provided by Go North East with the X84 service.\n\nCyclepath\nAfter the Scotswood, Newburn and Wylam Railway line was closed the trackwork was removed and the trackbed later converted into a cyclepath. That cyclepath forms part of National Cycle Network Route 72 and starts at Tyne Riverside Country Park at Low Prudhoe. After Wylam it keeps to the north side of the River Tyne, linking Wylam with Newcastle and the coast at Tynemouth. There is another cyclepath on the south side of the river which starts in the car park at Wylam railway station and links Wylam to Gateshead and the coast at South Shields.\n\nWylam's parish church was built in 1886 and is dedicated to St. Oswin, a Northumbrian saint. Wylam St. Oswin's has a regular Sunday and weekday services. Pre-1886 the villagers of Wylam had to walk to nearby Ovingham to attend church, George and William Hedley, sons of Frances and William, the railway engineer, contributed most of the money needed to build the church so the Anglicans of Wylam could have their own place of worship. The church has six bells with regular Sunday ringing and a practice night on Mondays.\n\nWylam also has a Methodist chapel, located on Chapel Lane. The chapel was extended in the 1990s to extend the worship and meeting areas, and to also include a kitchen.\n\nChurches in and around Wylam, notably Horsley and Crawcrook, of different denominations have a covenant to work together in the community, to share in youth work and some special services such as Harvest, Remembrance Day and some Christmas and Easter services.\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1997 and every election since has been won by a Labour Party candidate.\n\nAn earlier constituency of the same name existed between 1918 and 1983, but lay further to the south-east, and was a predominantly Conservative seat.\n\n\nThe constituency is one of five covering the city of Liverpool, and covers the localities in the eastern parts of the city such as Wavertree, Broadgreen, Childwall, Edge Hill, Kensington, Fairfield, part of Mossley Hill and Old Swan.\n\nThe present Liverpool Wavertree constituency dates from 1997. It contained parts of the former constituencies of Liverpool Broadgreen and Liverpool Mossley Hill. It was held by Jane Kennedy of the Labour Party from 1997-2010, who was also the former MP for Liverpool Broadgreen. At the 2005 general election, the Labour lead over the Liberal Democrats was cut from 38 points to 15 points. At the 2010 general election, Jane Kennedy retired, and Luciana Berger was selected as the official Labour candidate, which caused some friction in the local CLP, especially due to her close connection with Kennedy.\n\nAn earlier Liverpool Wavertree constituency existed until 1983; this was further to the south-east in the city and was predominantly a Conservative seat, occasionally with large majorities. It had been created in 1918, but a declining population in the 1970s caused it to be split between Liverpool Garston, the newly-formed Liverpool Broadgreen and Liverpool Mossley Hill constituencies. While the Conservatives have fared badly in the new Wavertree constituency (polling under 7% at the 2005 general election), a direct comparison must take into account the differing boundaries since the 1997 recreation: with more inner-city areas than its previous incarnation, the seat is home to constituents on a lower income than the average in the North West and who are traditionally less sympathetic to Conservative policies. The 2015 general election result made the seat the seventh-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nAt the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats' targeting of the seat led to a high turnout; however, it was comfortably retained by Labour with a 2.1% swing away from the Liberal Democrats. The unexpected turnout led, unusually, to one polling station running out of ballot papers.\n\nA general election was planned for 1939/1940 but was postponed because of war.

{"id": "1811320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811320", "title": "NBA on NBC", "text": "NBA on NBC\n\nThe NBA on NBC is the branding used for presentations of National Basketball Association (NBA) games produced by the NBC television network in the United States. NBC held broadcast rights from 1955 to 1962 and again from 1990 (when it obtained the rights from CBS) to 2002. During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with ratings surpassing the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the mid-1980s.\n\nNBC's first tenure with the National Basketball Association began on October 30, 1954 and lasted until April 7, 1962. NBC's very first NBA telecast was a game between the Boston Celtics and Rochester Royals in Rochester.\n\nFor the 1954–55 season, Marty Glickman and Lindsey Nelson called all games except on April 9 (Fort Wayne @ Syracuse during the playoffs), when Glickman worked with Jim Gordon. Nelson would later write in his autobiography, \"Hello Everybody, I'm Lindsey Nelson\" that NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff would travel to the televised games and, when NBC needed to get in a commercial, he would go up to one of the coaches and say, \"Call a timeout,\" and they had to, since the commissioner ordered it. On March 19, 1955 during the playoffs, NBC gave the national spotlight to the New York Knicks and rising Boston Celtics at New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nFor the first year of NBC's tenure, the first five weeks of coverage followed a Canadian Football League game. That contract decreed that the network show 13 games (along with presumably the Grey Cup) on Saturday afternoons beginning in late August, and was signed one week after NBC had lost the rights to NCAA football to ABC.\n\nThe following year, Lindsey Nelson was paired with Curt Gowdy on commentary for all games except on February 25 (St. Louis @ New York), March 3 (Minneapolis @ Rochester with Nelson working with Joe Lapchick), and March 24 (Fort Wayne @ St. Louis with Nelson working alone). On March 31, 1956, NBC broadcast the first nationally televised NBA Finals game, which was Game 1 of the Philadelphia-Fort Wayne series.\n\nGowdy and Nelson were retained as the primary broadcast team for NBC in 1956–57 except on March 23 and March 30 (St. Louis @ Boston), when Nelson worked by himself. While the team of Gowdy and Nelson again did most games in 1957–58, Nelson worked the December 14 telecast (Syracuse @ Detroit) with Chick Hearn, who in return, worked the January 11 telecast (Syracuse @ Cincinnati) with Gowdy. For the January 18 telecast (Detroit @ St. Louis), Nelson worked alone while on February 1 (Syracuse @ Minneapolis), Nelson was paired with Bill O'Donnell. Meanwhile, Gowdy worked alone on March 1 (Cincinnati @ Philadelphia).\n\nNBC also during the 1957–58 season, broadcast a game in Detroit between Cincinnati and the Pistons on March 15. It was after this game, on the flight home to Cincinnati, that Maurice Stokes became ill and later suffered a seizure, fell into a coma and was left permanently paralyzed. This was the delayed reaction from having hit his head in a game three days earlier. Stokes died in April 1970.\n\nIn the 1958-59 season, Curt Gowdy worked alone on all games except on March 15 (New York @ Syracuse, when Gowdy worked with Bud Palmer), April 5 (Minneapolis @ Boston with Lindsey Nelson). The 1959 NBA All-Star Game marked the first time that the All-Star Game was nationally televised. However, NBC only broadcast the second half at 10 p.m. Eastern Time, in lieu of its \"Friday Night Fights\" telecast. The fact that the All-Star Game prior to this, was almost always played on a Tuesday night meant that NBC would have had to sacrifice most, if not all, of their evening programming. In the first few years, that would have meant taking off Milton Berle's program, which was starting to slide, but still would have made more money for the network than a pro basketball game. Plus, NBA owners weren't terribly savvy when it came to working with TV in this era, so they probably refused network requests to put it in a weekend afternoon slot.\n\nDuring the 1959–60 season, Curt Gowdy worked alone most on Saturday games while Lindsey Nelson worked alone on most Sunday games. Nelson also worked on Saturday April 2 (St. Louis @ Boston) during the playoffs. Marty Glickman meanwhile, worked alone on December 6 (St. Louis @ Cincinnati), January 2–3 (New York Knicks @ Cincinnati and Boston @ Syracuse), February 28 (Philadelphia @ Detroit), March 13 (Philadelphia @ Syracuse), 20 (Boston @ Philadelphia), and 27 (St. Louis @ Boston), and April 3 (Boston @ St. Louis). Finally, Bill O'Donnell worked alone on March 12 (Minneapolis @ Detroit), 19 (St. Louis @ Minneapolis), and 26 (Minneapolis @ St. Louis).\nIn the 1960-61 season, Lindsey Nelson was alone on all games except when he worked with Bud Palmer on October 22 (New York @ Cincinnati) and 29 (New York @ Detroit), November 26 (Syracuse @ Boston), December 3 (New York @ Syracuse), 10 (Syracuse @ Detroit), and 24 (Detroit @ Boston). Jerry Doggett helped call games on November 5 (Syracuse @ Los Angeles) and 19 (Detroit @ Los Angeles). Marty Glickman contributed to commentary on January 8 (Boston @ St. Louis), 15 (Philadelphia @ Syracuse), 22 (St. Louis @ Cincinnati), and 29 (Philadelphia @ Boston), February 19 (Boston @ Syracuse) and 26 (Boston @ Detroit), March 12 (Boston @ Syracuse), 19 (Syracuse @ Boston), and 26 (Syracuse @ Boston), and April 2 (St. Louis @ Boston).\n\nFor NBC's final season of their first stint with the NBA, Bud Palmer worked alone on commentary on all games except for on February 3 (Cincinnati @ New York) and April 7 (Los Angeles @ Boston), when he was paired with Bob Wolff.\n\nNBC's ratings during this time period were lukewarm at best. By 1962, NBA ratings for NBC's Saturday afternoon games dipped to 4.8 (9 million viewers) as compared to Sunday afternoon NFL ratings of 10.4 (15 million viewers). As a matter of fact, CBS was at one point, getting better ratings for their National Hockey League telecasts than NBC was getting with the NBA. One possible factor for the dipping ratings the fact that NBC's 1960–61 schedule placed the three weakest teams--Cincinnati, Syracuse, and Detroit on television a total of 14 times. In comparison, three of the NBA's best teams--Boston, St. Louis, and Philadelphia—appeared on NBC a total of only seven times.\n\nOn November 9, 1989, the NBA reached an agreement with the network worth US$600 million contract to broadcast the league's games for four years, beginning with the 1990–91 season. On April 28, 1993, NBC extended its exclusive broadcast rights to the NBA with a four-year, $750 million contract.\n\nNBC's coverage of the NBA began on Christmas Day each season, with the exception of the inaugural season in 1990 (which featured a game on November 3 between the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs), the 1997–98 season (which included a preseason tournament featuring the Chicago Bulls), the 1998–99 season (as no Christmas games were played due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout), and the final season of the network's contract in 2001–02 (which included two early season games featuring the return of Michael Jordan with the Washington Wizards). NBC aired the NBA All-Star Game every year (with the exception of 1999, when the game was canceled due to the lockout), usually at 6:00 p.m., Eastern Time. In 2002, NBC aired the game an hour earlier (at 5:00 p.m., Eastern) due to the Winter Olympics later that evening. Starting in 2000, during the NBA Playoffs, NBC would air tripleheaders on Saturdays and Sundays during the first two weeks of the playoffs. Prior to 2000, NBC would air a doubleheader on Saturday, followed by a tripleheader on Sunday.\n\nOn December 30, 2000, NBC aired a rare second December game. The Saturday match was the only time that NBC aired a game between Christmas Day and the start of the regular run of games in February. In 2001, NBC was scheduled to air an October preseason game involving an NBA team playing an international team; that game was canceled due to the September 11 attacks. During the 2001–02 NBA season, NBC added a significant number of Washington Wizards games to its schedule (due to the aforementioned return of Michael Jordan). When Jordan became injured during the middle of the season, the network replaced the added Wizards games with the games that had been originally on the schedule (for example, a March 2002 game between the Wizards and Orlando Magic was replaced at the last minute with an Indiana Pacers–Sacramento Kings game).\n\nThe theme music for the \"NBA on NBC\" broadcasts, \"Roundball Rock\", was composed by new-age artist John Tesh. The instrumental piece, which NBC used for every telecast during the network's twelve-year tenure. Although Tesh offered the theme to ABC when it took over the rights to the league, the network declined.\n\nIn 1991, \"The Dream is Still Alive\" by Wilson Phillips was played during the end of the season montage. Afterwards, until 1996, NBC would play the rock song \"Winning It All\" by The Outfield during its end-of-season montage. From 1997 to 2001, several contemporary music pieces were used for the montage (including, in 1997, R. Kelly's song \"I Believe I Can Fly\", which coincidentally came from a basketball film – \"Space Jam\", which starred Michael Jordan and Pat Benatar's song \"All Fired Up\" from 1999 to 2001). After the 1999 Finals, NBC used \"Fly Away\" by Lenny Kravitz for their montage.\n\nIn 2002, after NBC's final broadcast, the network aired a montage of memorable moments from every year of coverage, using music from \"Titans Spirit\" (from the film \"Remember the Titans\") to \"Winning It All\" and most notably, \"To The Flemish Cap\" from the 2000 film \"The Perfect Storm\". The song composed by James Horner is played at the beginning of the montage as well as the end featuring footage from the Los Angeles Lakers dynasty era. This theme song has made a brief comeback as part of NBC's Olympic basketball coverage in 2008, and again in 2016. In December 2018, Fox Sports acquired the rights to \"Roundball Rock\" for use during college basketball games.\n\nThe pre-game show for NBC's NBA telecasts was \"NBA Showtime\", a title that was used from 1990 until 2000, with the pre-game being unbranded afterward. \"Showtime\" was originally hosted by Bob Costas from the inaugural season of the 1990 contract to the 1995–96 season; Hannah Storm took over as host beginning with the 1996–97 season, who in turn was replaced by Ahmad Rashād in 2001 when Storm went on maternity leave. The video game \"NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC\", by Midway Games, was named after the pregame show.\n\nDuring the NBA Finals, additional coverage would be immediately available on CNBC, in which the panelists provided an additional half-hour of in-depth game discussions, after the NBC broadcast network's coverage concluded.\n\nThe halftime show was sponsored by Prudential Financial (\"Prudential Halftime Report\"), and later NetZero (\"NetZero at the Half\") and Verizon Wireless (\"Verizon Wireless at the Half\"). The broadcasts also featured a segment during the live games called \"Miller Genuine Moments\", which provided a brief retrospective on a particular historically significant and/or dramatic moment in NBA history; this segment was discontinued towards the end of NBC's coverage. For a brief period in 2001–02, NBC aired a studio segment called \"24\", in which each analyst (at that time, Pat Croce, Jayson Williams or Mike Fratello) would have 24 seconds to talk about issues concerning the NBA. NBC (in conjunction with completely revamping the pregame show) discontinued the segment in February 2002, after Williams was arrested on murder charges.\n\nDuring its twelve-year run, the \"NBA on NBC\" experienced ratings highs and lows for the NBA. In the 1990s, the NBA Finals ratings were stellar, with the exception of 1999 Finals. In 1998, the NBA set a Finals ratings record, with an 18.7 household rating for the second Chicago Bulls–Utah Jazz series, the last championship run by the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. The very next year (after a lockout which erased part of the season), the ratings for the 1999 Finals plummeted, marking the beginning of an ongoing period of lower viewership for the league's game telecasts. In 2002, NBC set a record for the highest-rated Western Conference Final, including a 14.2 rating for Game 7 of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings.\n\nNBC's highest-rated regular season game was Michael Jordan's first game back from playing minor league baseball; the March 1995 game between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers scored a 10.9 rating (higher than all but three NBA telecasts on ABC). As a comparison, the first game in Jordan's second comeback (a game against the New York Knicks that aired on TBS opposite the 2001 World Series) scored a rating between a 3.0 and 4.0. NBC's first game of Jordan's second comeback scored ratings similar to that number.\n\nSeveral NBA observers accused NBC and the NBA of being biased with only certain teams and individual players. NBC benefited from having all of the Finals it televised involve the large-market Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers or Houston Rockets; however, smaller-market teams such as those in San Antonio, Sacramento, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland, Utah, Indiana, Orlando and Miami all made regular appearances on NBC games during its run.\n\nUpon the expiration of NBC Sports' contract with the NBA in 2002, the league signed a broadcast television rights agreement with ABC, which began airing games in the 2002–03 season. NBC had made a four-year, US $1.3 billion bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead made six-year deals worth $4 billion with ESPN, ABC and TNT.\n\nSimply put, NBC could not compete with the combined broadcast and cable deal that Disney had with ESPN and ABC. To put things into proper perspective, when NBC's relationship with the NBA ended in 2002, their only cable properties then were CNBC and MSNBC. The major leagues receive more money from cable than broadcast, due to the dual revenue stream of subscriptions and ad revenue. It took a decade for NBC to have a strong cable portfolio, which now includes USA, E!, SyFy, and NBC Sports Network, among other channels. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that NBC lost $35 million because of the failure of the XFL the previous year. As Charles Barkley summed it up during halftime of Game 1 of the 2002 NBA Finals \"If y'all hadn't wasted all that money on the XFL, y'all would still have basketball.\"\n\nWhereas NBC normally televised 33 regular games per year, ABC would generally air fewer than 20 regular season games annually. According to NBA Commissioner David Stern, the reduced number of network telecasts was at the league's own request since the NBA believed that they would get a higher audience for a single game (in contrast to NBC's tripleheaders). From 2002 to 2006, the NBA's ratings on broadcast television (ABC) dropped almost a full ratings point (from nearly a 3.0 average rating to just above a 2.0 rating). NBC averaged a 5.5 average rating during the 2002 NBA Playoffs. ABC averaged a 3.3 average rating for the 2005 NBA Playoffs.\n\nIn response to the impending loss of NBA coverage, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker said:\n\nWithin two years of the network losing the NBA rights, NBC dropped to fourth place in the prime time television rankings for the first time in its history, which was also partly the result of a weaker prime time schedule, and would more or less remain there for almost nine years.\n\nNBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said:\n\nEbersol added:\n\nIn a down economy, after losing $100 million on the NBA in 2000-2001, NBC was projecting a $200-million loss in 2001-2002. The NBA also saw its NBC ratings for the regular season fall from 4.3 in 1999 to 3.0 in 2000. Meanwhile, and the playoff ratings dipped from 6.5 to 4.9.\n\nNBC network president Randy Falco said:\n\nNBC's last NBA telecast to date was Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals, which closed with highlights from the network's 12-year run with the league, through the Chicago Bulls' dynasty led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the retirement of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers' new Shaq/Kobe reign. The final image of the end montage was set in an empty gym, showing a basketball bouncing into the background and ending with the message, \"Thanks for The Memories.\" Prior to the sequence, match commentators Marv Albert, Steve Jones and Bill Walton evaluated the end of their NBA contract and of the series. After that, Bob Costas closed the network's last NBA broadcast with the following:\n\nTNT airs many of the NBA's marquee games (the NBA All-Star Game, a full Conference Final (alternating between the Western Conference in even-numbered years and the Eastern conference in odd-numbered years), Opening Night games, and the vast majority of playoff games). In recent years, fans have reckoned it as what NBC was during that network's coverage of the league. TNT would seem to be the NBA's preferred carrier as well; from 2003 to 2005, TNT aired the Conference Final with the most interest from the national media (Spurs-Mavericks in 2003, Lakers-Wolves in 2004 and Pistons-Heat in 2005). TNT also airs most of the big games during the regular season (TNT aired a Lakers-Heat game for the third straight year in 2007), and TNT studio content is streamed to NBA.com via the \"TNT Overtime\" section.\n\nMany NBA games currently air with NBC Sports branding as part of the various NBC Sports Regional Networks' (formerly known as Comcast SportsNet) broadcast rights with individual NBA teams.\n\nAs previously mentioned, NBC Sports first broadcast the NBA from the 1954–55 through 1961–62 seasons. The announcers during this period included:\n\nNBC's first broadcast team of the 1990s–2000s era was made up of Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, with Ahmad Rashād serving as sideline reporter. Other broadcasters at the time included Dick Enberg and Steve \"Snapper\" Jones. Aside from Rashad, Jim Gray and Hannah Storm also handled sideline reporting duties; before becoming the television voice of the Spurs, Lakers and Pelicans, Joel Meyers also started as a sideline reporter for NBC. Bob Costas presided as host of the network's pre-game show, \"NBA Showtime\".\n\nIn 1992, shortly after announcing his retirement, basketball legend Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson became a top game analyst (alongside the likes of Enberg, Albert and Fratello); however, his performance was heavily criticized. Among the complaints were his apparently poor diction skills, his tendency for \"stating the obvious\", his habitual references to his playing days, and an overall lackluster chemistry with his broadcasting partners. Johnson would ultimately be slowly phased out of the \"NBA on NBC\" after helping commentate the 1993 NBA Finals.\n\nIn 1994, Mike Fratello left the booth (in order to become the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers) and was replaced with Matt Guokas. Albert and Guokas broadcast the 1994 NBA Finals and were joined for the 1995 NBA Finals by Bill Walton. Albert, Guokas and Walton, while not working regular season games together (Walton usually worked games with Steve Jones and play-by-play announcers Dick Enberg, Tom Hammond or Greg Gumbel), broadcast the next two Finals (1996 and 1997) together in a three-man booth.\n\n1997 was the last time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an embarrassing sex scandal forced NBC to fire Albert before the start of the 1997–1998 season. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his soft voice and often stammered analysis.\n\nThe team of Costas, Thomas and Collins worked the major games that season including the 1998 NBA Finals (which set an all-time ratings record for the NBA). Mike Breen, who played second fiddle to Albert on MSG Network's New York Knicks broadcasts, was hired to do select playoff games that year and was later promoted to backup announcer status. For the 1998–99 season, Thomas was moved to the studio, while Costas and Collins made up the lead team. The 1998–1999 season, which was marred by a lengthy lockout (which resulted in the regular season being shortened to 50 games) included the low-rated 1999 NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. Albert was brought back for the 1999–2000 season, making a return which included calling that year's lead Christmas Day game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers from Staples Center.\n\nThe 2000–2001 season brought to an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the \"NBA on NBC\" (although Costas would work playoff games for the next two seasons and would return to host NBC's coverage for the 2002 NBA Finals). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on maternity leave, with Ahmad Rashād taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rashād were former Phoenix Suns player Kevin Johnson and former NBA coach P. J. Carlesimo. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the 2001 NBA Finals, which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since 1998. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.\n\nDuring the 2001 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers, NBC decided to cross-promote its NBA coverage with its then-popular quiz show \"The Weakest Link\". Two 10-minute editions of \"The Weakest Link\" aired during halftime of Games 2 and 3, featuring Bob Costas, Bill Walton and Steve Jones as contestants, along with Charlotte Hornets guard Baron Davis and WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks's center, Lisa Leslie.\n\nThe 2001–2002 season featured several anomalies, as NBC started their coverage on the first Saturday of the season, for the first time since 1991. The reason for this was NBA legend Michael Jordan's return to playing, this time for the Washington Wizards. NBC covered an early December game featuring Jordan's Wizards as well, which marked the first time a broadcast television network aired more than one pre-Christmas NBA game since CBS in the 1980s.\n\nThat year also marked the return of Hannah Storm from maternity leave, with her and Ahmad Rashād alternating as studio hosts throughout the 2002 season. That year, NBC's studio team consisted of Rashad and Storm with former Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce, the returning Mike Fratello, and former player Jayson Williams. The tandem stayed together through the 2002 NBA All-Star Game. During the week between the All-Star Game and NBC's next scheduled telecast, Williams was arrested after shooting and killing his limousine driver. He was promptly fired by NBC, which also did not return Croce or Fratello to studio coverage. Instead, the network brought in Tom Tolbert, who had only recently been added to NBC Sports as a third-string analyst paired with Mike Breen. Tolbert stayed on as the lone studio analyst through the end of the season, and won acclaim by several in the media, including \"USA Today\" sports columnist Rudy Martzke. Hannah Storm was not able to anchor the 2002 NBA All-Star Game as she was on assignment at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City serving as daytime studio host; Rashād solo anchored from the studio.\n\nIn June 2002, Ahmad Rashād told the \"Los Angeles Times\", in an interview conducted before the 2002 NBA Finals began, that he would be ending his 20-year run with NBC Sports, after hosting the pre-game show for Game 3 of the Finals. Hannah Storm, meanwhile, covered the 2002 NBA Finals as host of the CNBC post-game show.\n\nTwo days before NBC was to begin its playoff coverage, both Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, returning from working a Philadelphia 76ers–Indiana Pacers game on TNT, were seriously injured in a limousine accident. That week, NBC juggled its announcing teams, which resulted in Bob Costas and Paul Sunderland working some early-round playoff games. Fratello would return to TNT after several days, and Albert returned to NBC for Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe season would also turn out to be NBC's last with the NBA. In January 2002, the league announced a six-year agreement with The Walt Disney Company and AOL Time Warner, which resulted in the broadcast television rights being acquired by ABC. That year, NBC's playoff ratings were much higher than in previous years, including tallying record-high ratings for the 2002 Western Conference Finals. Those high ratings did not translate to the Finals, which scored their lowest ratings in over two decades.\n\n\nJim Fagan's voice was heard in nearly every single NBA telecast on NBC; as the voice behind \"This is the NBA on NBC\", he also did several voice-over promotions for the network's game broadcasts, along with \"arena announcer\" duties in EA Sports's \"NBA Live\" video game series. Mitch Phillips also did voice-over work for the broadcasts, primarily for promotions.\n\nNBC showed Women's National Basketball Association games from 1997 to 2002 as part of their \"NBA on NBC\" coverage before the league transferred the rights to ABC/ESPN. A more rock-oriented variant of John Tesh's theme, \"Roundball Rock\" introduced by NBC to coincide with the debut of the WNBA.\n\nOn June 27, 1996, NBC Sports was announced as the WNBA's first national broadcaster. The WNBA soon, also had television deals in place with the Walt Disney Company and Hearst Corporation joint venture channels, ESPN and Lifetime Television Network, respectively. At the time, NBC didn't pay television rights fees to the league's teams.\n\nNBC nationally televised the very first WNBA game on June 21, 1997. The game featured the New York Liberty facing the Los Angeles Sparks in Los Angeles. For NBC's final season with the WNBA in 2002, they again began their season's worth of coverage on Memorial Day weekend with the Liberty and Sparks. NBC would proceed to televise WNBA games on Saturday and Sunday afternoons culminating in the Championship game on August 30.\n\nNBC's halftime report was sponsored by Lee Jeans.\n\nThe very first WNBA season concluded with what was at the time, a single championship game. The following year, the finale series into a best-of-three games series, with NBC airing the first two games and ESPN airing the decisive third game. In 1999, ESPN aired the first game of the championship series while NBC covered the following two. Come the year 2000, Lifetime temporarily assumed ESPN's role as the WNBA's cable outlet for the WNBA Championship. Like the year prior, Lifetime broadcast the first game while NBC covered the second and ultimately decisive game between the Houston Comets and New York Liberty. This marked Houston's fourth consecutive WNBA Championship.\n\nESPN returned to the fold in the year 2001, broadcasting the first game with NBC airing the second and decisive game between the Los Angeles Sparks and Charlotte Sting. For NBC's final year of coverage in 2002, ESPN2 this time, broadcast the first game with NBC again covering what would become the second and ultimately decisive game. The Los Angeles Sparks' 69-66 victory over the New York Liberty on August 31, 2002 would therefore, prove to be the final broadcast of the \"WNBA on NBC\".\n\nNBC Sports' broadcast of the inaugural WNBA game between the Liberty and Sparks received a 3.8 overnight national rating. Although NBC's end-of-season average for 1999 was even with 1998's average, viewership had actually increased from 1,540,000 households in 1998 to 1,607,000 in 1999. On the same token however, Nielsen ratings for NBC broadcasts of WNBA games slipped from 2 million households reached in 1997—the WNBA's inaugural season—to 1.5 million in 1999.\n\nThe average rating for the first 9 of the 10 WNBA games NBC carried in the 2001 season was only 1.1, compared to a 2.0 rating its first season.\n\nDuring the WNBA's first season on NBC, the primary announcing team consisted of Hannah Storm calling the play-by-play with Ann Meyers doing the color commentary and Lisa Malosky assuming the role as sideline reporter. The following year, Storm receded her lead play-by-play duties to Tom Hammond, who would call NBC's coverage of the WNBA Finals with Ann Meyers in 1998 and in 2000. For the 1999 season and 2001 seasons, NBC used Mike Breen as their primary play-by-play announcer. For the WNBA's final season in 2002, Paul Sunderland worked with Meyers for their coverage of the WNBA Finals.\n\n\n"}

It is bordered to the north by South Ribble, to the east by West Lancashire, and to the south by Sefton Central.\n\nIn the 19th century a notable representative was George Nathaniel Curzon, future Viceroy of India.\n\nIn the 20th century, outside politics, Edward Marshall Hall was a notable trial barrister (KC) and Sir John Fowler Leece Brunner was the son of the leading industrialist Sir John Tomlinson Brunner.\n\nAs a frontbencher, long-serving representative Robert Hudson was recognised at the time of World War II as a competent Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in charge of that department, and was made, to give him a peerage, a viscount.\n\nThe constituency has been a Liberal or Conservative seat throughout its history, and marginal for much of this, enabling it to change hands 11 times between the parties since it was created in 1885, having had nine Conservative MPs and eight Liberal or Liberal Democrat MPs in its history.\n\nDuring the nadir of the Liberal Party (from the 1930s to the 1960s) the constituency became a safe Conservative seat, with absolute majorities from 1931 until 1970 inclusive.\n\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott ran for Labour for the seat in 1966 and came in second place.\n\nWith the rise again of the Liberal Party in the early 1970s, election results proved to be close contests. The constituency changed hands in the 1987 general election, when it was taken by Ronnie Fearn of the Liberal Party for the SDP-Liberal Alliance (shortly before the two parties merged to form the Liberal Democrats). Fearn had contested the seat unsuccessfully for the Liberals throughout the 1970s.\n\nFearn lost the seat to the Conservatives' Matthew Banks at the 1992 election (one of the few Conservative gains at that election), only to regain it at the 1997 election. The Liberal Democrats held the seat (under John Pugh after Fearn stood down in 2001) until 2017.\n\nIn the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union, the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, of which the constituency is a part, voted to remain in the European Union by 51.9%. Given its demography, it is estimated that Southport voted to remain by 54%.\n\nThe seat was one of the eight Liberal Democrat seats that survived the national vote share collapse during the 2015 general election, despite a higher-than-average drop in the Liberal Democrats' vote share. Pugh opted not to seek re-election in the 2017 general election, in which election the seat returned to the Conservatives, the only seat the Tories gained from the Liberal Democrats in 2017 (aside from Richmond Park, which they had gained at a 2016 by-election). A resurgent Labour vote pushed the Liberal Democrats into third place for the first time since 1966 with the seat now becoming a somewhat unlikely Tory-Labour marginal, with just under 3,000 votes between the two major parties. If Labour were to win this seat at the next general election while holding its existing seats in Merseyside, it would mark the first time Labour (or indeed any party) has won every constituency in the county.\n\nWorkless claimants (registered jobseekers) were in November 2012 close to the national average of 3.8%, at 4.0% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811328", "title": "Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers", "text": "Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers\n\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), with its head office in Calgary, Alberta, is a lobby group that represents the upstream Canadian oil and natural gas industry. CAPP's members produce \"90% of Canada’s natural gas and crude oil\" and \"are an important part of a national industry with revenues of about $100 billion-a-year (CAPP 2011).\"\n\nCAPP origins can be traced back to the Alberta Oil Operators’ Association, which was founded in 1927, after the discovery of the Turner Valley Oil Field. In 1947, the Alberta Petroleum Association changed its name to the Western Canadian Petroleum Association, and In 1952, the Western Canada Petroleum Association amalgamated with the Saskatchewan Operators’ Association and adopted the name Canadian Petroleum Association.\n\nAt a meeting on December 9, 1952, the CPA drafted a new constitution which outlined the objectives of the organization as follows:\n\n\nOn June 10, 1958 the CPA opened an office in Ottawa and became \"one (of) the oldest, largest and most influential lobby groups in Canada.\" It provided the federal government with information pertaining to the oil industry while keeping the CPA informed about political trends, government regulations and statistics. By 1965 the CPA had a membership of more than 200 members representing roughly 97 percent of all oil and gas production in Canada. In 1981, two years after the first commercial discovery at Hibernia off the coast of Newfoundland, the CPA opened an office in St. John’s in cooperation with the Eastcoast Petroleum Operators’ Association.\n\nIn 1992, when the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) was formed, with the CPA amalgamation with the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada (IPAC) to form the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), Gerry Protti was named as founding president.\n\nAccording to the Federal lobbyist registry, from January to September 2012, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers had 178 contacts with federal officials to discuss issues such as pipelines, making it the lobby group with the most contacts that year. They lobbied on greenhouse gas regulations related to the Clean Air Act, Fisheries Act, pipeline regulation and tax credits.\n\nCanada's estimated total oil reserves including conventional oil were approximately 180 billion barrels (29 km³), behind only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Canada produces approximately 2.7 million barrels (430,000 m³) of crude oil a day, and 6.4 trillion cubic feet (180 km³) of natural gas per year. In 2013, an IPSOS poll showed a majority (75%) of Canadians prioritize local crude before using imported oil from foreign sources, while just over one in ten (14%) ‘disagree’ (4% strongly/11% somewhat) and 11% have no opinion.\n\nCAPP has advocated for the industry as GHG emissions rose 14% in 2009 and 2010, by its own admission. . However, GHG emissions per barrel of oil sands crude produced have dropped by 26% since 1990 as a result of new operating practices and technology.\n\nAccording to IHS CERA, oil sands crude has similar CO2 emissions to other heavy oils and is 9% more intensive than the U.S. crude supply average on a wells-to-wheels basis.\n\nThe industry employs 550,000 people and paid billions in taxes and royalties to different levels of government.\n\nAdvocacy for Oil Sands\nCAPP's series of meetings in 2010 in eight cities in Canada and the United States, including Vancouver, Edmonton, Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Washington D.C., New York and Chicago, with CAPP representatives, oil sands CEOs and 160 key stakeholders, culminated in a report entitled \"Dialogues\" published on 14 April 2011.\n\nCAPP advocates for the use of the controversial technology hydraulic fracturing. In 2010 released a series of voluntary Guiding Principles for Hydraulic Fracturing for Canadian natural gas producers to adhere to. The Guiding Principles of Hydraulic Fracturing were followed in 2011 by an agreed set of Six Hydraulic Fracturing Practices for:\n1. Fracturing fluid additive disclosure\n2. Fracturing fluid additive risk management\n3. Baseline groundwater testing\n4. Wellbore construction\n5. Water sourcing and reuse\n6. Fluid handling, transport, disposal.\n\nThe Council of Canadians and Sierra Club Canada take a strong position against hydraulic fracturing and want it banned in Canada entirely, and have supported specific bans in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\n\nCAPP supports and advocates for exports of Canadian crude oil via Canada's west coast via the Northern Gateway and the KinderMorgan TransMountain Expansion Project. In September 2011, the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) and the Canada West Foundation established the Canada-Asia Energy Futures Task Force with Kathleen (Kathy) E. Sendall, C.M., FCAE, a former Governor and Board Chair of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) and Kevin G. Lynch, a Canadian economist and former Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, Canada's most senior civil servant as co-chairs, to investigate a long-term Canada-Asia energy relationship. One of their recommendations was the creation of a public energy transportation corridor.\n\nCanadian opponents to the Northern Gateway , intended to permit shipping of high-carbon Canadian crude over ecologically sensitive rivers and waters to carbon-uncontrolled countries including India and China, include 61 First Nations in British Columbia.\n\nCAPP supports and advocates for the $7-billion pipeline expansion project by the Canadian-based company TransCanada to build the Keystone XL, that would extend and expand capacity of existing pipelines, that transport crude oil from the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta to tidewater and to refineries in the Gulf, capable of refining the heavy bitumen crude oil.\n\nNine winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama, were signatories to a letter to pressure U.S. President Barack Obama to reject the $7-billion pipeline expansion project by the Canadian-based company TransCanada to build the Keystone XL.\n\nThe position of the Nobel Peace Prize winners, essentially, is that one rich nation selling increasingly heavy high-carbon oil to another sabotages any effort to reach a deal on global carbon controls, and that moves to expand this export (like Keystone XL or Northern Gateway) cause significant and direct risks to world peace, as climate victim countries become subject to chaotic weather, fighting over scarce water (especially in Southeast Asia and Africa), flooding and rising sea levels.\n\nCAPP opposed the Kyoto Protocol, from which Stephen Harper withdrew Canada in December 2011. CAPP's lobbying efforts included favouring \"made in Canada\" approach and advocating for a carbon pricing program. In 2007 a carbon tax was implemented in Alberta, Canada's major oil and gas producing province. Supported by CAPP and in the industry, the $15/tonne carbon tax feeds a GHG emissions reduction technology fund.\n\nBy 2008, the oil sands industry contributes (approximately 3%–4%) of Canada’s GHG emissions (approximately 3%–4%. By 2012, oil sands contributed 0.14% of global GHG emissions. Transportation and electricity were the largest contributors of GHG, with transportation contributing 190 Mt of CO2 equivalent per year (MtCO2eq yr−1) and electricity and heat generation: 125 MtCO2eq yr−1. However, by 2007 (Environment Canada 2007) cautioned that unrestricted development of the oil sands could increase its emissions and the percentage. A 2008 CAPP report argued that both the Alberta and Federal governments adopted \"comparable industry GHG emissions targets in which large emitters must reduce their emissions by either improving their operation, purchasing emissions credits or investing in technology funds.\"\n\nCanada was the first signatory nation to walk away from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. The U.S. abandoned the Kyoto Protocol in 2001.\n\nIn the summer of 2011 CAPP contacted ENV to requested a meeting with the Canadian Society for Unconventional Gas (CSUG), and officials from several government ministries, including Alberta Environment, Energy, Sustainable Resource Development (SRD), as well as the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), (now Alberta Energy Regulator) to discuss CAPP’s desire to strike a committee to develop a public communications strategy focused on fracturing and water use associated with shale gas development.\" Senior-level government and industry officials attended the joint meeting \"to develop a plan to shape public perceptions of shale gas development and water use.\" From Alberta Energy participants included Director of Unconventional Gas Doug Bowes, Associate Branch Head Matthew Foss, Environment and Resource Services Audrey Murray, Executive Director of Resource Development Sharla Rauschning, Assistant Deputy Minister Resource Development Policy Division Jennifer Steber. From Alberta Environment participants included, Deputy Minister Ernie Hui, Former Head of Groundwater Policy within the Water Policy Branch, now the Exec. Dir. of OH&S Policy and Program with Human Services Ross Nairne. From Sustainable Resource Development (SRD) participants included Assistant Deputy Minister Glen Selland, Executive Director, Land Management Branch Jeff Reynolds, Officials from CAPP included VP Operations David Pryce, Manager of BC Operations Brad Herald, Manager of Water and Reclamation Tara Payment. From the Canadian Society for Unconventional Gas (CSUG) CSUG (a.k.a. CSUR) participants included Vice President Kevin Heffernan.\n\nJune 8, 2011, e-mail to senior government officials from the Energy Resources Conservation Board, the arm’s length regulator of the oil and gas industry in Alberta, to several meetings to produce a collaborative communications campaign on fracking strategy. On 9 June 2011 the Alberta government approved collaborative communications campaign in the minutes of their joint meeting. stating that\n\nBy 29 November 2011, the CBC and the Alberta Federation of Labour (AFL), were investigating the role played by CAPP in influencing Alberta Environment over public communications surrounding shale gas extraction, a controversial practice that has significant environmental concerns associated with it, especially when fracturing is employed. Questions were raised about the legality of private interests influencing government. Complaints were filed and dismissed.\n\nPrior to the 2019 Canadian federal election CAPP registered as a political third party, which \"The Calgary Herald\" said was \"breaking with tradition\" \"for the first time\" to increase its advocacy efforts on behalf of the oil industry. As oil prices rose, the profits of the Alberta oil industry in 2019 experienced a $909 million profit compared to the $678 million loss in Q4 in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. By Q1 2019, operating profits of the oil industry increased by $1.6 billion. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney had said during his election campaign that he would request that the energy industry \"significantly increase its advocacy efforts.\"\n\nThe Canadian Petroleum Industry faces a major crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, as canadian crude oil prices fell to records low. Facing dire economic prospects, CAPP intensified its lobbying efforts with the federal government. On March 27, the group sent a 13-page letter to Natural Resources minister Seamus O'Regan and other ministers to ask them to defer or waive some of the industry's regulatory obligation, to defer the development or implementation of new policies regarding the industry, and to implement policies to support the industry directly. Specifically, this meant that the Industry requests, among other things, to defer the reporting of its greenhouse gas emission, to defer the implementation of the new Mathane regulation and carbon pricing, and to delay the introduction of legislation that would entrench the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in canadian law.\n\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde wrote a letter to CAPP President and CEO Tim McMillan telling him to back off from advocating for the indefinite delay of the implementation of UNDRIP in Canada. Macmillan responded by affirming CAPP's support of UNDRIP, but maintaining that such legislation shouldn't be adopted during the pandemic because of the government's limited ability to hold consultations during this time.\n\n\n\n\"Additional information about the lobbying controversy can be found here: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/11/29/edmonton-lobbying-compalint-dismissed.html\"\n\n"}

It is one of four constituencies covering the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.\n\nThe Boundary Commission initially proposed the abolition in its 2005 draft review: Wallasey was to have been linked with sections of the city of Liverpool in a cross-river constituency. The areas are linked only by a road tunnel under the river Mersey. Following opposition from political parties, local MPs and local residents, the sub-plan was dropped. The change made was the omission of a 40 electors' sub-neighbourhood from formerly shared ward: Hoylake and Meols in favour of Wirral West.\n\nThe seat was created under the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n\nAngela Eagle of the Labour Party gained the Wallasey seat in 1992.

Increasing unemployment in the area saw the Conservative vote decline throughout the 1980s in local and general elections, only retaining Moreton West & Saughall Massie and Wallasey wards on the local level into the 2010s, with the remaining wards such as Leasowe and Seacombe safely Labour.\n\nA Conservative candidate has been runner-up since 1992.

Known for his villainous and comic roles in Hindi films, he has featured in more than 700 films throughout his career. In the 1980s and 1990s, Kapoor teamed up with actor Asrani and Kader Khan as the comical or evil team in over 100 films. He was a contestant in the Indian reality show \"Bigg Boss\" in 2011.\n\nShakti Kapoor was born in Delhi, India to a Punjabi family. His father ran a tailor shop in Connaught Place, New Delhi. After a long struggle, Shakti Kapoor was spotted by Sunil Dutt while he was making \"Rocky\" to launch his son Sanjay. He was then cast as the antagonist in the movie. But Sunil Dutt felt that his name \"Sunil Sikanderlal Kapoor\" wouldn't do justice to his villainous stint and hence, \"Shakti Kapoor\" was born.\n\nShakti Kapoor's portrayal of RD earned him praises and made him a name to be sought out for.\n\nShakti Kapoor is married to Shivangi Kolhapure (elder sister of actresses Padmini and Tejaswini) and has two children, a son Siddhanth Kapoor and a daughter Shraddha Kapoor . He resides in Juhu, Mumbai.\n\nAs a struggler in Bollywood, initially Shakti Kapoor did many inconsequential roles in movies, all the while looking out for a suitable role as a leading man. He started his Bollywood journey with movie Khel Khilari Ka ( starring Darmendra & Hema Malini) in 1977. The years 1980–81 established Shakti Kapoor as an actor in Bollywood with two of his movies, where he was villain - \"Qurbani\" and \"Rocky\". In 1983, Kapoor had roles in \"Himmatwala\" and the Subhash Ghai directed movie \"Hero\". Kapoor had played villain roles in both these movies.\n\nIn the nineties, he often diversified to positive comic roles and performed them with equal finesse. He has been nominated for the Filmfare Award in the Best Comedian category and won once, for his performance as Nandu in David Dhawan's film, \"Raja Babu\". Some of his comic roles have been as Inspector Bhinde in \"Insaaf\", Prasad in \"Baap Numbri Beta Dus Numbri\", Crime Master Gogo in \"Andaz Apna Apna\", \"Tohfa\", as Batuknath in \"ChaalBaaz\" and as Goonga in \"Bol Radha Bol\".\n\nKapoor has been a reference for mimicry artistes who emulate his style and dialogues such as \"Aaaooo Lolita\" from the movie \"Tohfa\", \"Main Nanha sa Chotta sa Bachcha Hoon\" from the movie \"Chaalbaaz\" and \"Nandu sabka bandhu, samajhta nahi hai yaar\" from the movie \"Raja Babu\". Since 2000, Kapoor is a regular fixture in Priyadarshan films like \"Hungama\", \"Hulchul\", \"Chup Chup Ke\", \"Malamaal Weekly\" and the Malayalam remake \"Bhagam Bhag\". He also acted in a few Bengali films of Kolkata, Odia film and in an Assamese feature film. In 2011, he was in the reality television show \"Bigg Boss 5\" as one of the contestants. He has appeared in the musical comedy \"Aasman Se Gire Khajoor Pe Atke\" with his sister-in-law Padmini Kolhapure. He is also the brand ambassador of Servokon. He also appeared in the Punjabi movie Marriage Da Garriage\n\nShakti Kapoor was seen as a contestant in the popular controversial Indian reality show \"Bigg Boss\", season 5. He was the captain of the house for the first two weeks but eventually got eliminated in the fourth week of the show.\n\nIn March 2005, India TV released a video, allegedly showing Shakti Kapoor asking for sexual favour from an undercover reporter posing as an aspiring actress, in return for entry into the film industry. Where he told the undercover reporter \"I want to make love to you...kiss you\" According to India TV, this was a sting operation to expose the phenomenon of casting couch prevalent in Bollywood. This incident sparked a controversy in Bollywood and Kapoor was banned by the Film & Television Producers Guild of India. Association of Indian Motion Pictures and TV Programme Producers decided not to ban him as no allegations against him were proved. One week later, however, the Film & Television Producers Guild lifted the ban.\n\nKapoor claimed that the video clip in question was doctored and he has been framed. He said that the undercover reporter met him several times and threatened to commit suicide if he did not come to the hotel room she had booked.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811356", "title": "Cahaba Prison", "text": "Cahaba Prison\n\nCahaba Prison, also known as Castle Morgan, was a prisoner of war camp in Dallas County, Alabama where the Confederacy held captive Union soldiers during the American Civil War. The prison was named Castle Morgan after Cahaba lawyer and Confederate Brigadier General John Tyler Morgan. The prison was located in the small Alabama town of Cahaba, at the confluence of the Alabama and Cahaba rivers, not far from Selma. It suffered a serious flood in 1865. At the time, Cahaba was still the county seat, but that was moved to Selma in 1866. Cahaba Prison was known for having one of the lowest death rates of any Civil War prison camp mainly because of the humane treatment from the Confederate commandant.\n\nThe Confederate Army built a stockade around a large cotton warehouse near the Alabama River to prepare the site. Cahaba Prison was opened as such in June 1863. The commanding officer was Captain H. A. M. Henderson, a Methodist minister. \nThe prison made use of a brick cotton warehouse built in 1860 on Arch Street, above the banks of the Alabama River. This structure covered approximately and was surrounded by a larger wooden stockade. It was intended for approximately 500 prisoners, but its population had grown to 660 by August 1864. When Union General Ulysses S. Grant suspended the practice of prisoner exchange with the Confederacy, the numbers began to soar. By October 1864 the number of prisoners held here was 2,151; they had increased to more than 3,000 by March 1865.\n\nFormer prisoner Jesse Hawes describe the two men in charge by the following: Captain Howard A. M. Henderson was \"remembered with kindly wishes…It was often in the power of Henderson to extend kindnesses and courtesies to prisoners, and we are glad to note that the opportunity was not infrequently embraced.\" But he wrote of Lieutenant-Col. Samuel Jones, \"we find one whose record was a sickening blotch upon humanity...The relations between Jones and Henderson were never cordial, and at times were quite unfriendly. It was urged by one or two of the guards that Jones, when not drunk, was less brutal then he would ordinarily seem; but unfortunately for the poor wretches whose very lives depended on his moods, he was never seen by us except when intoxicated.\"\n\nJacob Rush of the 3rd Ohio Cavalry enlisted at age 15, having lied about his age. He was captured as a spy, met with General Nathan Bedford Forrest, and was sent to Cahaba Prison, arriving on October 13, 1864. While there he met Union Captain Hanchette and helped organize an escape attempt. They were successful in capturing the guards, but the demoralized condition of the prisoners resulted in a failed attempt. Confederate reinforcements came from the town and the prisoners were charged with conspiracy. Captain Hanchette refused to give up the names of the men involved, and none of the other prisoners admitted to them, either. The suspected conspirators were kept four days without rations. Jacob Rush and Jesse Hawes, M. D. later wrote first-hand accounts of the prison, the conditions, and the escape attempt.\n\nThey learned that Captain Hanchette was to be exchanged for a Confederate general confined at Vicksburg. Rush reported that Colonel Jones, who both hated and feared his victim, selected two villainous men to act as his guard, and gave them instructions to find some excuse for shooting him while taking him from Cahaba to Selma, where the exchange was to be conducted. \nCaptain Hanchette was taken forth from the dark dungeon, his strong frame so reduced that he was scarcely able, even under the stimulus of hope, to stand, placed in the custody of the assassins, and started toward Selma. He was shot down in cold blood before he was a mile from town, a fate perfectly in accord with a confinement rarely paralleled in the bounds of any civilized country in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe regional district commander, Lt. Col. Samuel Jones, negotiated an exchange of Union prisoners from Cahaba for captured Confederates, with the prison being evacuated in March 1865. The exchange took place at Vicksburg, Mississippi in April 1865, after a long and arduous journey by the prisoners.\n\nR. H. Whitfield, the prison surgeon, reported unhygienic conditions at the camp, citing the lack of a sanitary water supply. The warehouse building had one fireplace and 432 bunk spaces. Despite this, the death rate was about 2%, the lowest rate of any Civil War prison camp. Most Confederate camps averaged 15.5% and Union camps had mortality rates of more than 12%; most deaths were due to disease. Federal and Confederate records indicate that between 142 and 147 men died at Cahaba Prison.\n\nThe most outstanding health problem were constant outbreaks of flea infestations. Park historians believe the low death rate was mainly due to the humane treatment of the prisoners based on Capt. Henderson's Methodist beliefs. Once freed, many of these prisoners later died in the subsequent \"Sultana\" disaster; it sank while transporting them to the North.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811390", "title": "NBA on ABC", "text": "NBA on ABC\n\nThe NBA on ABC is a presentation of National Basketball Association (NBA) games produced by ESPN, and televised on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The \"NBA on ABC\" name is rarely used, using \"NBA on ESPN\" branding and graphics to be integrated with its cable sister network.\n\nABC originally broadcast NBA games from 1965 to 1973. In 2002, NBA games returned to the network as part of a contract signed with the league, along with ESPN.\n\nABC televises games throughout the regular season, typically starting with a doubleheader on Christmas Day, followed by select games on Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons as part of its \"NBA Saturday Primetime\" and \"NBA Sunday Showcase\" series. ABC then airs up to nine games during the first five weeks of the NBA playoffs, and is the exclusive broadcaster of the NBA Finals.\n\nABC first signed a deal with the National Basketball Association to become the league's primary television partner in 1964; the network's first game telecast aired on January 3, 1965 (a game between the Boston Celtics and Cincinnati Royals). ABC's initial alliance with the NBA first came about due to ABC Sports head Roone Arledge's search for live programming that could diminish the ratings of \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", and ABC's own analogy program, \"Wide World of Sports\" a boost with sponsors. ABC initially paid the NBA only $650,000 for the rights annually.\n\nFor much of the 1960s, ABC only televised Sunday afternoon games, including during the NBA Playoffs. This meant that ABC did not have to televise a potential NBA Finals deciding game if it were played on a weeknight. In 1969, ABC did televise Game 7 of the Los Angeles Lakers–Boston Celtics series in prime time on a weeknight. The following season, ABC aired the 1970 NBA Finals in its entirety, making it the first Finals series to have all games televised nationally.\n\nCommentators for the original \"NBA on ABC\" included play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson and Chris Schenkel, and analysts Jack Twyman, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell. On April 8, 1967, a strike by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) forced ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard and director Chet Forte to call Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, as its regular announcing team were members of the union. Curt Gowdy also served on play-by-play for half of the 1967–68 season.\n\nThe first nationally televised Christmas Day NBA broadcast occurred in , when ABC broadcast a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and San Diego Rockets from the then-San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego. Jerry Gross and Jack Twyman called that particular broadcast for the network. ABC would continue to televise Christmas games through . The remainder of these broadcasts were based from Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. Chris Schenkel did play-by-play for ABC during this period with the exception of , when Keith Jackson held that responsibility. Jack Twyman remained as color commentator for the broadcasts up until , when the position was assumed by Bill Russell. \n\nBy 1969, ABC's NBA contract worth only $3 million. To put things into proper perspective, in 1969, Major League Baseball's television contract with NBC was worth $16.5 million while the National Football League cost CBS about $22 million. What that meant is that ABC had made a bargain in purchasing the television rights to the NBA, considering the league's steady ratings. To give you a better idea, ABC's ratings for the NBA rose from a 6.0 in 1965 to an 8.2 in 1968.\n\nABC was by this time, coming increasingly under fire for what perceived to be a less than spectacular presentation of the NBA. \"Sports Illustrated\"s Frank Deford in particular, singled ABC out for their coverage of the 1971 NBA Finals. Deford felt that ABC was making a mistake in trying to cover the NBA the same way that they covered a football game, because they were two different games. On that end, Deford wrote that neither ABC's announcers nor cameras were able to isolate the important phases of the game. He added that replays were used only to second-guess officials rather than \"capture the grace and precision of the performers\". Meanwhile, Deford also criticized play-by-play man Chris Schenkel his failure to appreciate the nuances of the game and their halftime shows, which Deford saw not innovative or imaginative.\n\nABC lost the broadcast rights to the NBA to CBS after the 1972–73 season, with the network's initial tenure with the league ending with its last NBA Finals game on May 10, 1973. ABC filled the void left by losing the NBA by counterprogramming \"Wide World of Sports\" on Sundays against CBS' NBA coverage.\n\nFrom the 1984–85 through 1989-90 seasons, the ABC Radio Network was the official, national radio broadcaster of NBA games, succeeding the Mutual Broadcasting System. ABC Radio was in return, supplanted by Public Interest Affiliates' (or PIA's) NBA Radio Network.\n\nCommentators included Fred Manfra on play-by-play and Oscar Robertson (from 1984–85 through 1985–86), Dick Vitale (from 1986–87 through 1989-90) and Earl Monroe (from 1988–89 through 1989-90) on color commentary. Other announcers included Marv Albert (1989 All-Star Game) and Chick Hearn (1988 All-Star Game) on play-by-play and Rod Hundley (1987 and 1989 All-Star Games), Johnny Most (1988 All-Star Game), and Dave Barnett (1986 All-Star Game) on color commentary.\n\nIn late 2001, the NBA was in the midst of putting together a new broadcast and cable television deal. At the time, conventional wisdom was that NBC would renew its existing broadcasting contract with the league. An October 5, 2001, \"Sports Business Daily\" article cited \"The New York Times\" sports columnist Richard Sandomir regarding the possibility of ESPN joining with ABC in obtaining a portion of the contract:\n\nThe negotiations were closely watched by those in the business world, as it was the first time that a major sports league crafted a television deal in the new economic environment since the September 11 terrorist attacks a few months before. Declining ratings for NBC's NBA game telecasts had already led many to believe that the NBA's next television rights fee would be lower than previous years, and the economic recession made that a likely scenario. As predicted, NBC's offer to the league was lower than the previous agreement's amount. Had the NBA agreed to the network's offer, it would have been the first sports league to experience a decline in rights fees. However, the NBA rejected NBC's offer and after the network's exclusive negotiating period with the league expired, ABC and ESPN stepped in. On January 22, 2002, the NBA signed a six-year deal with The Walt Disney Company and Turner Sports, which renewed an existing deal with TNT and allowed ABC and ESPN to acquire the rights to air the league's games. ABC and ESPN reportedly paid an average of about US$400 million a season. Technically, ESPN pays the NBA for its broadcast rights and \"buys\" time on ABC to air select games (this is noted in copyright tags during the end credits at the conclusion of the telecasts, saying \"\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\"\") In all, the contract allowed the NBA to increase its rights fees by 25%.\n\nNBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said regarding the deal:\nIn 2006, after ABC Sports became ESPN on ABC the \"NBA on ABC\" started to be produced by ESPN with ESPN graphics. All broadcasts have an \"on ABC\" suffix on their titles after this rebrand.\n\nIn June 2007, and again in October 2014, the NBA renewed its television agreement with ESPN, as well as TNT, with the current contract extending through the 2024–25 season.\n\nEach season, ABC begins its NBA coverage with a Christmas Day doubleheader (with the exception of 2004 and 2006, when the network broadcast only one game). From 2004 to 2006, ABC insisted on carrying a Christmas game between the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers. Since 2009, ABC's Christmas Day doubleheader has featured a music video featuring Mariah Carey performing her hit 1994 single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" In 2010, Carey was featured singing \"Oh Santa!\"\n\nFollowing the initial Christmas game telecasts, Sunday afternoon coverage of regular season games begins in mid-January or early February. The number of Sunday afternoon regular season games that ABC normally covers is significantly lower than what NBC broadcast during its tenure with the league. In its first season of coverage, ABC aired 14 regular-season games, in comparison to NBC's yearly average of 33 games. That number increased to 18 games in the next two seasons ( and ), and 20 games in the season. For , ABC decreased the number of game telecasts it aired during the season to 19. In a 2002 interview with Jim Rome, NBA commissioner David Stern commented about the number of league games broadcast on ABC:\nBy contrast to Stern's assessment, media analysts and many fans found that the cable-heavy television deal made many games unavailable and, in addition, devalued the league. Starting with the second round of the playoffs, TNT's NBA coverage becomes exclusive, meaning that no locally produced league broadcasts can compete against the TNT telecasts (though commensurate with the move to sports rights to cable, few over-the-air local stations currently carry NBA coverage). Because of this, fans of teams in the playoffs who do not have a cable television subscription are unable to watch most playoff games. In addition, ABC's coverage is always exclusive, including during the regular season. If an ongoing game airs opposite one televised by ABC, it cannot be televised in the local market, which has the side effect of causing some games to not be aired on television at all. \"Sports Business Daily\" quoted \"Houston Chronicle\" writer Jonathan Feigen regarding the structuring of the NBA's deal with ABC:\nOn July 17, 2015, ESPN announced that ABC would add a series of eight of Saturday night games to its slate of broadcasts in the 2015–16 season. The first of these games will air on January 23, 2016, and will air mostly bi-weekly until the end of the regular season. As a result of this change, ABC will no longer have regular Sunday doubleheaders.\n\nIn addition, unlike NBC or its preceding rightsholder CBS, ABC does not televise the NBA All-Star Game (with TNT instead holding the exclusive television rights to the game itself and most other events held during All-Star Weekend). Also unlike the other networks, ABC rarely televises either of the NBA's Conference Finals series. TNT airs one Conference Final exclusively each year (the Western Conference Finals in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017, while ESPN will get the other. With the exception of 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2015 (when the network did not air any games from that round at all), ABC airs Conference Final matches – whichever one to which ESPN holds the rights in a given year – held on weekends. Due to the checkerboard schedule of the NBA Playoffs (in which games are scheduled every other day), this is limited to one game per Conference Final, as series do not often reach a sixth or seventh game (for example, the network aired only Game 3 of the 2009 Western Conference Finals; ABC was scheduled to air the Sunday Game 7 of the series, however, the Los Angeles Lakers won the series in Game 6).\n\nOutside of the Conference Finals, ABC generally airs playoff games throughout the first five weeks of the NBA Playoffs, in addition to a number of special prime-time playoff games, usually televised on Thursday or Saturday nights. In 2005, ABC aired the first non-cable Memorial Day game in three years, when the Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs battled in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals. Prior to the most recent NBA television deal, Memorial Day playoff games had become a yearly tradition on network television.\n\nUnlike previous broadcast partners, ABC has never aired a non-Christmas regular season game after 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. While NBC had several 5:30 p.m. Eastern start times for games, ABC has only gone beyond that time on Christmas, and for select playoff games, including the Finals. On March 20, 2005, ABC aired a pair of games regionally (between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons, and the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies) at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. After the Spurs–Pistons game ended, the network opted to end coverage for its stations to carry regularly scheduled local programming instead of switching over to the Suns–Grizzlies game (in which the Suns were up 94–91 late in the fourth quarter, and was being shown on the West Coast and in the state of Tennessee, so the network didn't to delay local programming just for one market, Memphis). NBC rarely committed this practice, as it instead showed the tail end of a game still in progress after the previous game has completed, a prime example was in 1998, NBC switched to the Pistons-Timberwolves game after the Jazz-Rockets game ended, and the Pistons-Timberwolves game went to double overtime, resulting in NBC Nightly News being canceled for the East Coast).\n\nIn its first year of coverage, ABC used the same graphics package as partner network ESPN, with the \"score bug\" being the only difference between the two networks' packages. This habit had already been put into practice by the network in regards to its NHL and college basketball coverage. However, ABC did utilize its own graphics (though they were similar in resemblance to ESPN's at the time) for college football and other sports broadcasts. For the 2003–04 season, ABC established new graphics for its NBA broadcasts, in an effort to differentiate its telecasts from ESPN's. On February 5, 2006, ABC established another new graphics package, including a horizontal scoreboard (similar to that introduced the previous fall for its final season of \"Monday Night Football\") for the network's NBA telecasts.\n\nESPN, along with partner network ABC, began using graphics packages inherited by ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" broadcast starting in 2006, featuring a score banner with an oblique red and white design. The graphics were later replaced in April 2009 with a more compact grey design, with panel-like lower thirds and a permanent \"stats bar\" located underneath the score and time. This was replaced in 2010 with an updated appearance based on another redesign adopted by \"Monday Night Football\" in late 2009, featuring a more metallic appearance that would later be adopted by other ESPN properties, along with the addition of yellow lights beneath a team's name to indicate remaining timeouts. At the start of the 2011–12 season, an updated version of the design was adopted with a more translucent appearance, and the addition of a \"BONUS\" indicator under a team's score if they have reached enough fouls to initiate the Bonus situation. Starting with the 2013 Western Conference Finals, a newly designed banner featuring 3-dimensional renditions of the team logos were used. During the 2015 NBA Finals, the graphics were updated with gold coloring, patterned backgrounds, and a modern, unified font. At the start of the 2015-16 season however, ESPN reverted to the banner used since 2013. On May 17, 2016, the aforementioned updated graphics package from the previous year's NBA Finals returned for the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals and again for the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nBeginning with the 2016 NBA preseason on October 4, 2016, the graphics were updated again, this time, they are formatted for the full 16:9 letterbox presentation. The score bar, which is significantly larger than the previous one (used since the 2013 Western Conference Finals), was given a complete overhaul, with a numerical representation of timeouts replacing the \"lights\" used since the 2010-11 season and a permanent \"stats bar\" being moved to the right side of the score bar. The new, co-branded \"NBA on ESPN\" logo is now seen as an overlay on the upper left hand corner of the 16:9 screen. As was the case the previous two years, the gold coloring and patterned backgrounds were used again for the 2017 NBA Finals. Notably, this is the first time that both ESPN and ABC have used the full 16:9 frame for its graphics in the networks' NBA coverage.\n\nFor the 2017-18 season, the stat bar is only shown at the beginning of the game and after commercial breaks.\n\nOne common complaint about NBA coverage on ABC is the use of unconventional camera angles, including the Floorcam and Skycam angles, used by the network throughout its coverage. Other complaints are of camera angles that appear too far away, colors that seem faded and dull, and the quieting of crowd noise so that announcers can be heard clearly (by contrast to NBC, which allowed crowd noise to sometimes drown out their announcers).\n\nSome complaints have concerned the promotion, or perceived lack thereof, of NBA telecasts. The 2003 NBA Finals received very little fanfare on ABC or corporate partner ESPN; while subsequent Finals were promoted more on both networks, NBA-related advertisements on ABC were still down significantly from promotions on NBC. NBA promos took up 3 minutes and 55 seconds of airtime on ABC during the week of May 23, 2004 according to the \"Sports Business Daily\", comparable to 2 minutes and 45 seconds for the Indianapolis 500. Promotions for the Indianapolis 500 outnumbered promotions for the NBA Finals fourteen-to-nine between the hours of 9:00 and 11:00 p.m. during that week.\n\nThe network was also criticized for focusing its coverage on a select number of teams, particularly the decision to broadcast a Lakers-Heat game on its Christmas Day schedule for three consecutive years. However, for 2007, ABC decided to break this tradition by instead having the Heat, for the fourth straight time, appear on Christmas Day facing the 2007 Eastern Conference Champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2008, the Boston Celtics replaced the Heat on the Christmas Day schedule, and faced the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2009, the Cavaliers played the Lakers on Christmas Day. However, the Heat-Lakers Christmas Day special would make its return in the 2010–11 NBA season, as a result of LeBron James' recent move from the Cleveland franchise to Miami. For the 2011–12 NBA season, the Lakers and Heat played again on Christmas Day, but against separate opponents. The Lakers played the Chicago Bulls, while the Heat played the Dallas Mavericks in a rematch of the 2011 NBA Finals; both the Bulls and Mavericks made their ABC Christmas Day debuts, which also acted as the league's opening day that season due to the 2011 NBA lockout delaying the start of the season. In the case of the latter, ABC aired the pre-game championship ring and banner ceremony for the Mavericks, which marked the first time in NBA history a national broadcast network televised the ceremony.\n\nAfter the 1990s (when the NBA arguably reached its highest point in terms of popularity) many hardcore and casual fans began to associate the league with NBC, and more accurately, the network's theme music, \"Roundball Rock\". After ABC took over the NBA coverage from NBC, \"Roundball Rock\" composer John Tesh offered his iconic theme song to the new rightsholder, but ABC turned it down and told Tesh that they wanted a completely different song. Whereas NBC used \"Roundball Rock\" for all twelve years of its coverage, ABC ended up using at least nine themes in its first four years. Three of the themes were traditional sports themes, while six of them (\"'We Got Hoops\" by Robert Randolph and the Family Band, \"Can't Get Enough\" by Justin Timberlake, \"Let's Get It Started\" by The Black Eyed Peas, \"Lose My Breath\" by Destiny's Child, \"This Is How A Heart Breaks\" by Rob Thomas and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) were contemporary pieces by known artists.\n\nFor the 2006–07 NBA season, ESPN began using \"Fast Break\", the theme music used for ABC's NBA broadcasts since 2004, as the theme for its own NBA games. Because of the reorganization of ABC Sports under the oversight of ESPN, and its 2006 rebranding as ESPN on ABC (which calls for all sporting events aired on ABC to utilize the same production elements as ESPN's sports telecasts), this means that games broadcast on ABC will use the same theme music from previous years. In addition, ABC selected pop group The Pussycat Dolls to perform \"Right Now\" as the new introduction for NBA games.\n\nFor the 2008 season, \"Nine Lives\" by Def Leppard and Tim McGraw was used as the new intro song for ABC's game broadcasts, and was also used by ESPN during the playoffs prior to the start of each game. For the 2012 NBA Playoffs, the revised version of the 1972–73 theme was introduced, incorporating features of the current NBA players from going back from the previous year to years past during the network's tenure with the NBA.\n\nFor the 2011 NBA postseason, ESPN used an updated composition of the \"Fast Break\" theme music for the postseason, yet the original composition was still used for the regular season through the 2015-16 NBA season.\n\nFor the 2016-17 NBA season, ESPN used another updated composition of the \"Fast Break\" theme music. This time, for the regular season, replacing the original composition that was first used by ABC since the 2004-05 season and by ESPN two seasons later. Adding Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly's \" Before I Let Go\" to start the court side play by play commentary.\n\nIn its first three years of coverage, ABC televised 40 playoff games, whereas NBC aired 35 in 2002 alone. The San Antonio Spurs have appeared on ABC 36 times , the most of any other team. The second iteration of the Charlotte Hornets are the only team to have not appeared on ABC for a regular-season game (their 2016 Game 7 loss to Miami was broadcast on ABC) during the length of the current contract, whereas the San Antonio Spurs, Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas Mavericks have appeared on the network every year since 2002. The Atlanta Hawks did appear on ABC during the network's coverage in the 1960s and 1970s, including a Christmas Day game against the Phoenix Suns in 1970. The network did not air a game involving that team until Game 7 of the 2008 1st Round Playoffs, against the Boston Celtics. The Utah Jazz's appearances have all occurred during the playoffs, with the exception of a doubleheader game that occurred on April 2, 2017, against the Spurs. \n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers had appeared in ABC's featured Christmas Day game every season from 2002 to 2016 (against the Sacramento Kings in 2002, the Houston Rockets in 2003, the Miami Heat in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2010, the Phoenix Suns in 2007, the Boston Celtics in 2008, Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009, the Chicago Bulls in 2011 and 2014, and the Los Angeles Clippers in 2015 and 2016). After the Miami Heat, which have four Christmas Day appearances on ABC, the Sacramento Kings and the Boston Celtics are the only other teams to have had repeat appearances on the holiday.\n\nIn the early years, two women's-oriented networks, Lifetime and Oxygen, also broadcast games including the first game of the WNBA. NBC showed games from 1997 to 2002 as part of their \"NBA on NBC\" coverage before the league transferred the rights to ABC/ESPN.\n\nIn June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with ESPN. The new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016. A minimum of 18 games will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 each season; the rights to broadcast the first regular-season game and the All-Star game are held by ABC. Additionally, a minimum of 11 postseason games will be broadcast on any of the three stations. Along with this deal, came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, \"millions and millions of dollars\" will be \"dispersed to the league's teams\".\n\n\nInitially, Saturday and Sunday afternoon games were broadcast on ABC. But over time that changed. For 2013, only one game was shown on ABC on Saturday, June 8, and thirteen games were shown on ESPN2 on five different days of the week (no WNBA games were shown on Sunday or Friday on ESPN2). On opening day for the 2008 season (May 17), ABC broadcast the Los Angeles Sparks and Phoenix Mercury matchup. The game received a little over 1 million viewers. Average viewership for games broadcast on national television (ABC and ESPN2) was 413,000 (up from 346,000 in 2007). Average viewership for the 2007 WNBA finals was 545,000.\n\nViewership for the 2011 WNBA All-Star Game on ABC was up 46% from the previous game. Game 1 of the 2015 WNBA Finals telecast on ABC, drew 571,000 viewers, up from 558,000 for Game 1 in 2014. Game 1 of the 2016 WNBA Finals was broadcast on ABC and had 0.5 overnight rating (597,000 viewers), which was the best since 2010. The five game 2016 Finals broadcast on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 averaged a 0.3 rating and 487,000 viewers. Average viewership in 2016 was 224,000 viewers. \n\n\nAfter obtaining the NBA broadcast rights, ABC courted two main announcers from the \"NBA on NBC\", Bob Costas and Marv Albert. After Costas (who was reportedly offered a generous deal which also included offers to do play-by-play for ESPN's Major League Baseball telecasts and feature reports for ABC News) elected to remain with NBC, and Albert signed a six-year deal with TNT, the network went with veteran broadcaster Brad Nessler to be the lead play-by-play announcer for its NBA broadcasts. Nessler, who prior to that point had not been the main voice for any professional sport on television, received a call from Marv Albert's agent, soon after getting the job. On the call, Nessler said in an interview with the Internet Movie Database:\nNessler was initially joined on the broadcasts by color commentator Bill Walton and lead sideline reporter Michele Tafoya. The team of Nessler and Walton did two broadcasts together before ABC decided that Walton needed a partner (much like he had at NBC with Steve Jones) and assigned pre-game analyst Tom Tolbert to join the team. Nessler, Walton and Tolbert called most regular season games, and every network playoff game. Other games were called by the team of Brent Musburger and Sean Elliott. After suffering the worst ratings in NBA Finals history for the 2003 series, low ratings overall, and harsh criticism, ABC decided to retool the team. More to the point, during this particular period, Brad Nessler was accused by media analysts (among them, \"New York Times\" columnist Richard Sandomir) of not knowing game strategy well, lacking rhythm and enthusiasm in his game call, not bringing out the best in his partners, too often ignoring the score and his tendency to stammer.\n\nThis was also the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals involving teams from one market in the same year, as both the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the San Antonio Spurs and the Nets in New Jersey on June 8, Nessler, Tolbert and Walton said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night. Gary Thorne, Bill Clement and John Davidson mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler, Tolbert and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nAfter disastrous ratings for the 2003 Finals, ABC decided to completely revamp its lead NBA broadcast team. Brad Nessler was demoted to the secondary broadcast team, where he was joined by Sean Elliott and Dan Majerle. Tom Tolbert was relegated to pre-game show duties only, and Bill Walton was removed from the network's NBA coverage altogether (however, he would remain with ESPN). Meanwhile, longtime \"Monday Night Football\" commentator Al Michaels was hired to replace Nessler as the network's lead NBA play-by-play announcer; Michele Tafoya remained as its lead sideline reporter.\n\nDoc Rivers, a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with Turner Sports for TNT's NBA broadcasts, became available after a 1–10 start by his Orlando Magic led to his firing as the team's coach. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC's Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, Michaels and Rivers worked every single telecast, including the 2004 NBA Finals, which saw significant ratings improvement.\n\nDuring the 2004 NBA Playoffs, Doc Rivers was hired as head coach of the Boston Celtics. Though Rivers continued to work games with Al Michaels throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC was forced to search for a new lead analyst for the 2004–05 season. In addition, the network dropped Brad Nessler from all NBA coverage, and did not retain Sean Elliott or Dan Majerle.\n\nEarly in the 2004–2005 season, Memphis Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, a broadcasting legend with CBS, TBS and TNT, was forced into retirement due to health issues and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers as Al Michaels' broadcast booth partner. Brown called his first ABC game with Michaels on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated a Heat-Lakers game pitting those team's respective star players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. Michaels began covering NBA games sporadically, doing two games in early March and three additional games in April. Meanwhile, Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster Mike Breen. Michele Tafoya served as lead sideline reporter for all of the network's game broadcasts.\n\nIn addition to Hubie Brown, ABC added other known analysts to its NBA coverage. Jim Durham and Dr. Jack Ramsay both worked several games during the regular season, while Brent Musburger, John Saunders, Len Elmore and Mark Jackson were involved with others. Breen and Ramsay were the first secondary broadcast team to work a playoff game for ABC. Breen called three playoff games for the network in 2005, the most notable being Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals with Hubie Brown.\n\nAl Michaels was criticized by the \"New York Post\" for not broadcasting the game and seeming uninterested in the NBA in general. Barry Horn of \"The Dallas Morning News\" said that Michaels was simply \"not a basketball guy\". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels \"shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, ‘Only five weeks to the [NFL] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!’\" Another criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about. Michaels was also accused of apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a \"great, great contested shot\") expected of a main play-by-play voice.\n\nMichaels, who by the end of his tenure on the \"NBA on ABC\" only called a total of 37 NBA games overall with ABC (a combined thirteen regular season games), did return for the NBA Finals, which scored its second-lowest rating of all time (despite the fact that it was the first Finals in eleven years to go to a seventh game). From March 7, 2004 to April 17, 2005 – including playoff games – each game Michaels called involved either the Los Angeles Lakers (whose home city Michaels resides when not broadcasting sports events) or Sacramento Kings, a total of 21 consecutive games. Game 7 of the 2005 NBA Finals would end up being Michaels' last with the \"NBA on ABC\".\n\nFor the 2005–06 season, Al Michaels and Hubie Brown were slated to remain as ABC's main broadcast team. The duo worked that year's Christmas Day game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat and were expected to work the NBA Finals together as well. However, that plan did not come to fruition. In 2005, the National Football League (NFL) signed a contract with NBC for the rights to the Sunday night football (a package previously held by ESPN), which in turn resulted in \"Monday Night Football\", which Al Michaels had been broadcasting for nearly 20 years, ending its run on ABC after the league's 2005 season.\n\nSpeculation arose that Michaels would leave ABC for NBC, however he subsequently signed a deal to remain on \"Monday Night Football\", when it moved to ESPN in 2006. However, in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl XL (ABC's final NFL broadcast to date), it was widely speculated that Michaels was attempting to get out of his contract with ESPN to join John Madden (who worked alongside Michaels for the previous four years on \"Monday Night Football\" as an analyst) at NBC. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he could not \"respond to rumors... because that would become a distraction.\" On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its \"Monday Night Football\" team would consist of Mike Tirico on play-by-play, with football anaylst Joe Theismann and Tony Kornheiser as analysts. ESPN explicitly stated that Michaels would not return to either \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts or ABC's NBA broadcasts, all but assuring Michaels' departure from ABC after 30 years, and joining Madden at NBC.\n\nMichaels was replaced by Mike Breen, who became the lead broadcaster for an over-the-air NBA package for the first time in his career. Breen worked the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals and 2006 NBA Finals with Hubie Brown for both ESPN and ABC, as well as all the main games ABC broadcast that year. The promotion of Breen gave ABC its first consistent lead broadcaster since Brad Nessler, as Breen worked games every week. Breen previously had worked the Eastern Conference Finals for NBC in 2001 and 2002, as well as the Western Conference Finals for ESPN in 2005.\n\nMany sportswriters and sports media analysts praised Breen, some for his explosive voice and excited calls on game-deciding and game-winning shots and others for the fact that, unlike his predecessor Al Michaels, he was already very familiar with broadcasting basketball games and was essentially a basketball lifer. Despite that, he faced some criticism from those who complained that they would prefer a more established voice, such as Marv Albert or Kevin Harlan. Hubie Brown faced criticism from writers (most notably Richard Sandomir of \"The New York Times\") as well as bloggers and viewers.\n\nLisa Salters also served as the lead sideline reporter for ABC's regular-season game coverage and the NBA Finals that season, filling in for Michele Tafoya while she was on maternity leave. Salters returned to her role as its secondary sideline reporter when Tafoya returned the following year. For the secondary broadcast team, ABC reunited Bill Walton and Steve Jones for game coverage. Walton and Jones worked the Christmas Day 2005 broadcast between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons for ABC, the first game they called together since Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals for NBC (NBC's last NBA telecast to date). The pair worked their first broadcast with Mike Breen, and worked the remainder of the season with Brent Musburger, Jim Durham and Mike Tirico. That team, along with the Breen-Brown duo, now often does ESPN's Wednesday or Friday game coverage, which the previous ABC announce teams rarely did.\n\nABC also used several \"SportsCenter\" reporters, including Tom Rinaldi, Rachel Nichols and Jeremy Schaap, for pregame and halftime features during 2006.\n\nFor the 2006–07 NBA season, ABC's sports operations were fully integrated into ESPN (rebranding the sports division as ESPN on ABC). As a result, Mark Jackson replaced Hubie Brown as ABC's lead analyst (Brown would still pair with Mike Breen on ESPN's primary broadcast team and Mike Tirico on ABC's secondary team). ABC's pre-game show, which Jackson was a part of, also began to be broadcast from the site of the main game each week (much as was the case during first season of the network's current NBA deal in 2003).\n\nAdditionally, Michele Tafoya returned as a sideline reporter, after sitting out the 2005-06 season on maternity leave. Lisa Salters returned to her role as its secondary sideline reporter the following year as Tafoya returned to her old role.\n\nOn July 9, 2007, it was announced by Dan Patrick that he would be leaving ESPN after 18 years with the network. Stuart Scott hosted ABC's pregame show for the 2007–08 season along with analysts Bill Walton and Michael Wilbon. Jeff Van Gundy also joined Mike Breen and Mark Jackson full-time, starting Christmas Day. After Walton had back problems in February, Jon Barry replaced him for the rest of the season.\n\nMichele Tafoya left her role as NBA sideline reporter for ABC after the 2007-08 season to spend more time with her family, however she continued to work for ESPN, primarily serving as a sideline reporter for \"Monday Night Football\" (before leaving for NBC in 2011 to serve that same position for \"Sunday Night Football\"). Doris Burke, who already served as an analyst for ESPN's NBA telecasts, replaced Tafoya as lead sideline reporter on the ABC broadcasts.\n\nLisa Salters serves as a substitute for Burke in the event she is on assignment or is slated to handle analyst duties for the \"NBA on ESPN\", with Heather Cox filling in as part of the secondary announcing team for Salters, when she is working within the primary broadcast team. Cox took over the secondary role in 2012 after Salters became a full-time sideline reporter for \"Monday Night Football\", with either Chris Broussard, J. A. Adande or Holly Rowe serving as the secondary reporter whenever Cox was assigned as the lead reporter.\n\n, the main broadcast team currently consists of Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, while the secondary broadcast team consists of Mike Tirico and Hubie Brown, with either Mark Jones, Ryan Ruocco or Dave Pasch filling in when Tirico has other commitments. The \"NBA Countdown\" studio team consists of host Sage Steele, and analysts Jalen Rose and Doug Collins. ABC's second team of Tirico and Brown also comprise the lead team for NBA Finals coverage on ESPN Radio, with Kevin Calabro subbing in for Tirico on some occasions.\n\nJackson briefly left the broadcast booth to serve as head coach of the Golden State Warriors from 2011 to 2014. Prior to the 2011–12 season, ABC reassigned Stuart Scott to another role while the studio team worked without a main host in a more free-flowing approach. This experiment ended prior to the 2013–14 season, when Sage Steele became the lead host of \"Countdown\". Magic Johnson, Jon Barry, Michael Wilbon, Bill Simmons, and Chris Broussard have previously served as analysts for \"NBA Countdown\".\n\nFor the 2016–17 season, Mark Jones replaced Mike Tirico as part of the secondary broadcast team with Hubie Brown as Tirico left for NBC. Also, Doug Collins left \"NBA Countdown\" and joined ESPN's roster of game analysts, returning to a position he previously held while working with NBC and TNT. Steele was replaced as host by Michelle Beadle during the season.\n\n"}

He was born in Humpolec, Bohemia (today in the Czech Republic).\n\nHrdlička was born at Humpolec house 393 on 30 March 1869 and baptized Catholic the next day at the . His mother, Karolína Hrdličková, educated her child herself; his skills and knowledge made it possible to skip the primary level of school. When he was 13, Hrdlička arrived in New York with his father Maxmilian Hrdlička on 10 September 1881 via the SS Elbe from Bremen. His mother and 3 younger siblings emigrated to the U.S. separately. After arrival, the promised job brought only a disappointment to his father who started working in a cigar factory along with teenaged Alois to earn living for the family with 6 other children. Young Hrdlička attended evening courses to improve his English, and at the age of 18, he decided to study medicine since he had suffered from tuberculosis and experienced the treatment difficulties of those times. In 1889, Hrdlička began studies at Eclectic Medical College and then continued at Homeopatic College in New York. To finish his medical studies, Hrdlička sat for exams in Baltimore in 1894. At first, he worked in the Middletown asylum for mentally affected where he learnt of anthropometry. In 1896, Hrdlička left for Paris, where he started to work as an anthropologist with other experts of then establishing field of science.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1903, during his scientific travel across America, Hrdlička became the first scientist to spot and document the theory of human colonization of the American continent from east Asia, which he claimed was only some 3,000 years ago. He argued that the Indians migrated across the Bering Strait from Asia, supporting this theory with detailed field research of skeletal remains as well as studies of the people in Mongolia, Tibet, Siberia, Alaska, and Aleutian Islands. The findings backed up the argument which later contributed to the theory of global origin of human species that was awarded by the Thomas Henry Huxley Award in 1927.\n\nAleš Hrdlička founded and became the first curator of physical anthropology of the U.S. National Museum, now the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History in 1903. He was the founder of the \"American Journal of Physical Anthropology\" in 1918. After he stepped down, the journal volume number, which had reached Volume 29 in 1942, was restarted at Volume 1 in 1943.\n\nHrdlička was involved in examining a skull to determine that it belonged to Adolph Ruth, who was sensationalized in the press when Ruth went missing in Arizona in 1931 searching for the legendary Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. \n\nHe always sponsored his fellow expatriates and also donated the institution of anthropology in Prague, which was founded in 1930 by his co-explorer , in his natal country (the institution later took his name). Between 1936 and 1938, Hrdlička led the recovery of over 50 mummies from caves on Kagamil Island.\n\nHrdlička was interested in the origin of the human being. He was a critic of hominid evolution as well as the Asia hypothesis, as he claimed there was little evidence to go on for those theories. He dismissed finds such as the Ramapithecus which were labeled as hominids by most scientists, instead believing that they were nothing more than fossil apes, unrelated to human ancestry.\n\nIn a lecture on \"The Origin of Man,\" delivered for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Cincinnati, Ohio, Hrdlička said that the cradle of man is not in Central Asia but in Central Europe, as Europe is the earliest known location where human skeletal remains have been found.\n\nHrdlička was almost alone in his views. The European hypothesis fell into decline and is now considered an obsolete scientific theory which has been replaced by the Multiregional hypothesis and the Out of Africa hypothesis.\n\nMore recently, Hrdlička's methods have come under scrutiny and criticism with regard to his treatment of Native American remains. An AP newswire article, \"Mexico Indian Remains Returned From NY Museum For Burial\" from November 17, 2009, recounted his study of Mexico's tribal races, including the beheading of still-decomposing victims of a massacre of Yaqui Indians and removing the flesh from the skulls as part of these studies. He also threw out the corpse of an infant that was found in a cradleboard but forwarded this artifact along with the skulls and other remains to New York's American Museum of Natural History. While these practices are not inconsistent with other ethnographers and human origin researchers of that era, the moral and ethical ramifications of these research practices continues to be debated today. His work has also been linked to the development of American eugenics laws.\n\nAugust 6, 1896 Hrdlička married German-American Marie Stickler (whom he had courted since 1892), daughter of Phillip Jakob Strickler from Edenkoben, Bavaria, who immigrated to Manhattan in 1855. Marie died in 1918 of complications of diabetes. In the summer of 1920 Hrdlička married a second time, his fiancée was another German-American woman, Wilhelmina \"Mina\" Mansfield.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811409", "title": "Spiritual Baptist", "text": "Spiritual Baptist\n\nThe Spiritual Baptist faith is a syncretic Afro-American religion that combines elements of traditional African religion with Christianity. Despite the African influences, Spiritual Baptists consider themselves to be Christians.\n\nThe Baptist faith was brought to Trinidad by the Merikins, former American slaves who were recruited by the British to fight, as the Corps of Colonial Marines, against the Americans during the War of 1812. After the end of the war, these ex-slaves were settled in Trinidad, to the east of the Mission of Savannah Grande (now known as Princes Town) in six villages, since then called the Company Villages.\n\nThese American settlers brought with them the Baptist faith of the Second Great Awakening combined with, in the case of those from Georgia, the Gullah culture. With the coming of missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society from Great Britain, the Baptist faith in the Company Villages was much affected, but despite the ensuing schism between the so-called London Baptists and the rest, the Baptist congregations of the Company Villages, even including those with Gullah origins, retained so little visible African influence in their practice that John Hackshaw was able to give a different view of the Baptists in the north of the country:\n\nThe faith expanded to Barbados in 1957 as the Sons of God Apostolic Spiritual Baptists movement. It now ranks as one of two indigenous religions in the country, the other being the Rastafari religion. Archbishop Granville Williams, who was born in Barbados, lived for 16 years in Trinidad and Tobago, where he witnessed the local Spiritual Baptists. Becoming enthusiastic about the Trinidadian movement, he asserted that he had seen a vision and heard the voice of God. Upon returning to Barbados he held the first open-air meeting in Oistins, Christ Church. Due to a well received response in Barbados, he quickly established the Jerusalem Apostolic Spiritual Baptist Church in Ealing Grove. This church was quickly followed by Zion at Richmond Gap. As of 1999 the following in Barbados had reached around 1,900 and the Jerusalem church had been rebuilt to seat 3,000.\n\nThe name \"Shouter\" derives from the characteristic practice of the religion. Followers are very vocal in singing, praying, and preaching. However, \"shouter\" is seen as a derogatory term and the term \"spiritual\" is preferred due to the practice of invoking the Holy Spirit during worship.\n\nThe activities of the Spiritual Baptists in Trinidad and Tobago were prohibited in 1917 by the Shouter Prohibition Ordinance, which was eventually repealed in 1951. The late opposition parliamentarian Ashford Sinanan moved to repeal the ordinance under the PNM government and was successful. Today Spiritual Baptists can practise their religion freely. The United National Congress granted them a national holiday and also gave them land on which to establish their headquarters.\n\nThe colours of the headdress or clothes vary and represent the 'spiritual cities' or the saints with which the individual most relates. \n\nMen can wear a headwrap however the very top of the head is usually left uncovered. Men tend to wear a gown or short cassocks. Persons of higher rank (Shepherds, Reverends, Bishops, etc.) can wear a surplice over the gown.\n\n\nIn 1996 the Government of Trinidad and Tobago granted a public holiday to the Spiritual Baptist faith, to be celebrated on 30 March, called Spiritual Baptist/Shouter Liberation Day, in memory of the struggle and in recognition of the repeal of the prohibition law. Trinidad and Tobago is the only country that celebrates a public holiday for the Spiritual Baptist faith.\n\nMany Spiritual Baptist churches have overlapping memberships with practitioners of the Trinidad Orisha religion. In Trinidad, Orisha is also called Shango, and the term \"Shango Baptist\" is sometimes used to describe worshipers who are involved with both Spiritual Baptism and Orisha/Shango. The term \"Shango Baptist\" has come to have negative connotations for some worshippers of both Spiritual Baptism and Orisha/Shango, who argue that those who say \"Shango Baptist\" conflate the two religions, when in fact they are separate. As some have said, \"There is no thing as Shango Baptist. Shango is Shango. Baptist is Baptist\". Others say that Shango Baptists simply \"wear two hats\"; their mixture of \"Baptist and Orisha practices\" is a result of similar oppression by Colonial authorities in Trinidad.\n\nIn practice, the Trinidad Orisha religion is very closely connected with the Spiritual Baptists. Orisha worship services typically begin with a section of Baptist hymns, and in Trinidad and New York Orisha events are often held at the same locations as Spiritual Baptist churches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811447", "title": "Diocletian's Palace", "text": "Diocletian's Palace\n\nDiocletian's Palace (, ) is an ancient palace built for the Roman emperor Diocletian at the turn of the fourth century AD, which today forms about half the old town of Split, Croatia. While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nThe complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from Salona, the capital of Dalmatia (Roman province), one of the largest cities of the late empire with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian. The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical karst, consisting of low limestone ridges running east to west with marl in the clefts between them. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which in 1979 was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\n\nDiocletian had ordered the construction of the heavily fortified compound near his hometown of Spalatum in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD.. The site chosen was near Salona, the provincial administrative center of Dalmatia, on the southern side of a short peninsula, On the basis of Roman map data (known through the medieval parchment \"Tabula Peutingeriana\"), there was already a Spalatum settlement in that bay, the remains and size of which have not yet been established. \nThe beginning of the construction of Diocletian's palace has not exactly been established. It is assumed to have begun around 295, after the introduction of the Tetrarchy (the rule of four). Yet ten years after that decision, when Diocletian abdicated in 305, the palace seems to have still been unfinished, and there are indications that some works were taking place while the emperor was residing at the Palace. It is unknown under whose architectural ideas the palace was built and who its builders were. The complex was modeled on Roman forts of the 3rd-century era, examples of which can be seen across the Limes, such as the bridgehead fort Divitia across the Rhine from Cologne. \n\nHowever, the engraved Greek names Zotikos and Filotas, as well as many Greek characters, indicate that a number of builders were originally from the eastern part of the empire, i.e. Diocletian brought with him masters from the East. Still, it is highly likely that a large part of the workforce was of local origin. The basic materials came from close proximity. The white limestone comes from Brač and some of Seget near Trogir; tufa was extracted from nearby riverbeds and bricks were made in Spalatum and other workshops located nearby. The building as a whole did not have an immediate role in Roman construction in the past. Its source comes from the basic function and position adjustment.\n\nAt Carnuntum, people begged Diocletian to return to the throne in order to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation. Diocletian \nfamously replied:\n\nThis was a reference to the Emperor retiring to his palace to grow cabbages.\n\nDiocletian lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his \"damnatio memoriae\". In his palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.\n\nWith the death of Diocletian, the life of the palace did not end, and it remained an imperial possession of the Roman court, providing shelter to the expelled members of the Emperor's family. In 480, Emperor Julius Nepos was murdered by one of his own soldiers, reportedly stabbed to death in his villa near Salona. Since Diocletian's palace was in the area, it might have been the same building. \n\nIts second life came when Salona was largely destroyed in the invasions of the Avars and Slavs in the 7th century, though the exact year of the destruction still remains an open debate between archaeologists. Part of the expelled population, now refugees, found shelter inside the palace's strong walls and with them a new, organized city life began. Since then, the palace has been continuously occupied, with residents making their homes and businesses within the palace basement and directly in its walls. St Martin's Church is an example of this trend. Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes can still be found within the walls.\n\nIn the period of the free medieval commune, between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was a greater architectural development, when many medieval houses filled not only Roman buildings but also a large part of the free space of streets and docks. Also completed in this period was the construction of the Romanesque bell tower of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, which inhabits the building that was originally erected as Jupiter's temple and then used as the Mausoleum of Diocletian.\n\nAfter the Middle Ages, the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe, until the Scottish architect Robert Adam had the ruins surveyed. Then, with the aid of French artist and antiquary Charles-Louis Clérisseau and several draughtsmen, Adam published \"Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia\" (London, 1764).\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of Neoclassical architecture and the publication of measured drawings brought it into the design vocabulary of European architecture for the first time. A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter Louis-François Cassas created drawings of the palace, published by Joseph Lavallée in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.\n\nToday, the palace is well preserved with all the most important historical buildings, in the center of the city of Split, the second-largest city of modern Croatia. Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian Adriatic coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European, and world heritage.\n\nIn November 1979 UNESCO, in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of World Cultural Heritage.\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage were built.\n\nThe World Monuments Fund has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 500 kuna banknote, issued in 1993.\n\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle measuring east: 214.97 m, north: 174.74 m, south: 181.65 m (adjusting for the terrain), with sixteen towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades on the facades facing the mainland and four towers on the corners of the square are ground floor gives the palace a characteristic of the legionary forts similar to those on the Danube. \n\nTwo of the six octagonal ground-floor towers were framed by three landing entrances, the six rectangular ground floors of the rectangular floor being between the corner and the octagonal. To date, three corner corners (except southwestern) have been preserved, and only the remains of octagonal and rectangular ones. Three well-preserved landings have been architecturally fragmented, especially the northern one, which was the main approach from Salona. The south, seaside gate, small, simple and well preserved. The facade walls of the palace in their lower parts are massive and simple without openings, and in the upper part they are exposed to large arches that are simple to the land, ie on the west, north and east facades. Subterranean portions of the palace feature barrel vaulted stonework.\n\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern ’Sea Gate’ (the \"Porta Meridionalis\") was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.\n\nThe Porta septemtrionalis (\"the northern gate) \"is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace. Originally the Main gate from which the Emperor entered the complex, the gate is on the road to the north, towards Salona, the then capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and Diocletian's birthplace. It is probably the gate the Emperor entered after his abdication from the imperial throne on 1 May 305. Today the 7th century church of St Martin can be found above the gate, and is open to the public.\n\nThe Porta Orientalis (\"the eastern gate\") is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace. Originally a secondary gate, it faces east towards the Roman town of Epetia, today Stobreč. Probably in or around the 6th century, above the gate in the sentry corridor, a small church dedicated to St. Apolinar was built. This coincided with the complex seeing an influx of refugees from outlying communities, similar churches were over the Golden Gate, the Iron Gate, and the Bronze Gate. The structure of this part of the wall and the door itself were later incorporated in various buildings in the following centuries, such as the Church of Dušica, which was destroyed in the Second World War.\n\nPorta Occidentalis (\"the western gate\") is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace. Originally a military gate, from which troops entered the complex, the gate is the only one to have remained in continuous use to the present day. During the persecutions under Theodosius I a relief sculpture of Nika, the Roman Goddess of Victory (which stood on the lintel) was removed from the gate, later in the 5th century, Christians engraved a Cross in its place. In the 6th century, above the gate a small church dedicated to St. Teodora. This coincided with the complex seeing an influx of refugees from outlying communities, similar churches were over the Golden Gate, the Silver Gate, and the Bronze Gate.\n\nThe Porta Meridionalis or \"the southern gate\" is the smaller of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace. Originally a sea gate from which the Emperor entered the complex by boat, via basement rooms in the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe design is derived from both villa and castrum types, and this duality is also evident in the arrangement of the interior. The transverse road (decumanus) linking the Eastern gate and Western gate which divided the complex into two halves.\n\nIn the southern half there were more luxurious structures than the Northern section; these included both public, private and religious buildings, as well as the Emperor's apartments.\n\nthe Emperor's apartments formed a block along the seafront, with an exterior square and circular floor plan, with a dome. From there, one approached the Emperor's apartment, which stretched 40 m deep along the entire south facade; it is only partly preserved in the upper floor, but its ground-floor, translated substructures that directly bore it are almost completely preserved, so the overall layout and appearance of the upper spaces can be seen given the coincidence of the upper and lower floor plans. On the west side of the upper floor are preserved the remains of a dome hall and two halls with apses, and on the east side are parts of an octagonal dining room (triclinium) with three halls with a cross floor plan. The wall of the Western Cross Hall is preserved in full height. Diocletian's apartment was interconnected by a long room along the southern façade (cryptoporticus) from which through 42 windows and 3 balconies a view of the sea was opened. Two baths were recently found north of the Emperor's apartment, one adjacent to the west and the other to the eastern halls. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\nA rotonda, that was once the first section of the imperial corridor in the Palace that led via the Peristyle to the Imperial apartments of the Palace. \n\nSet below what were the Imperial apartments, the Cellars of Diocletian Palace are a set of substructures, located at the southern end of the Palace, that represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world.\n\nA monumental court, called the Peristyle, formed the Northern access to the imperial apartments in front of the Vestibule. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the East (today the Cathedral of Saint Domnius), and to three temples on the West (two of which are now lost, with the third, originally being the temple of Jupiter, becoming a baptistery). There is also a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of Aesculapius, which has a semi-cylindrical roof built of stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s when it was covered with a lead roof. The temple was recently restored.\n\nThe northern half of the palace, divided into two parts by the main north-south street (\"cardo\") leading from the Golden Gate (\"Porta aurea\") to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities.\n\nBoth parts of the palace were apparently surrounded by streets, leading to the perimeter walls through a rectangular buildings (possibly storage magazines).\n\nThe Palace is built of white local limestone and marble of high quality, most of which was from the Brač marble quarries on the island of Brač, of tuff taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in Salonitan and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: Egyptian granite columns, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the Proconnesos.\n\nThe Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite sphinxes, originating from the site of Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III. Only three have survived the centuries. One is still on the Peristyle, the second sits headless in front of Jupiter's temple, and a third is housed in the city museum.\n\nDiocletian's Palace was used as a location for filming the fourth season of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\". The palace also hosted a task on the 31st season of the CBS reality show \"The Amazing Race\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

By far the most popular brand of lens solutions until 2006, ReNu has rebranded its formulations as renu sensitive (formerly ReNu Multi-Purpose) and renu fresh (formerly ReNu MultiPlus), the latter containing a patented ingredient called hydranate, known by chemists as hydroxyalkylphosphonate, that removes protein deposits and can eliminate the need for a separate enzymatic cleaner.\n\nThe brand made headlines in 2006 when a report from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested an increased incidence of fungal keratitis in people using Bausch & Lomb products. Bausch & Lomb subsequently suspended, then recalled shipments of one particular product, ReNu with MoistureLoc. Other ReNu formulations were unaffected, as they do not include the special ingredient in MoistureLoc, which was supposed to keep lenses moist but unfortunately also allowed microbes to survive the disinfection process.\n\nIn November 2005, Hong Kong health officials told Bausch & Lomb about a significant increase in hospital admissions due to contact lens related keratitis from June to September 2005.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, New Jersey ophthalmologist Dr. David S. Chu contacted Bausch & Lomb to report that three of his patients had contracted a fungal infection called Fusarium keratitis; all three of these patients were contact lens wearers who used Bausch & Lomb's Renu with MoistureLoc. Subsequently, he also reported his findings to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 8, 2006.\n\nOn April 10, 2006, the CDC announced that it was investigating 109 patients in the United States suspected to have \"Fusarium\" keratitis. They reported that they had complete data available for 30 patients in this group, the earliest onset of infection of which was June 15, 2005.\n\nOn April 11, 2006, Bausch & Lomb stopped shipments of its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution from its Greenville, South Carolina, plant after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found what appeared to be a high correlation between use of the product and cases of suspected fungal keratitis. Similar claims had already been made against the product in Hong Kong and Singapore. The news about the U.S. suspension led to a 14.6% drop in the company's stock price—a drop of $8.41, to $49.03—the largest the company experienced in 5½ years.\n\nOn April 13, 2006, Bausch & Lomb announced that it is withdrawing the ReNu with MoistureLoc product world-wide and is recommending that consumers stop using ReNu with MoistureLoc immediately. The FDA supports this decision. The FDA, as well as the American Optometric Association, also advise now that contact lenses be rubbed and rinsed even when a no-rub contact lens solution is used.\n\nAccording to a preliminary report released by the FDA on May 16, 2006, Bausch & Lomb failed to notify the FDA that Singapore's Ministry of Health reported 35 serious cases of \"Fusarium\" keratitis to Bausch & Lomb in February 2006.\n\nThe U.S. suspension does not include ReNu products without MoistureLoc.\n\nOnly supplies of ReNu with MoistureLoc manufactured in the company's US plant are affected. European supplies are considered to be safe.\n\nOn March 7, 2007, Bausch & Lomb issued a voluntary recall on 1.5 million bottles of ReNu MultiPlus solution due to higher than normal amounts of iron in the batch.\n\n"}

The Joffrey regularly performs classical ballets, including \"Romeo & Juliet\" and \"The Nutcracker\", and modern dance pieces. Many choreographers have worked with the Joffrey, including Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, George Balanchine, and founders Gerald Arpino and Robert Joffrey. Founded as a touring company in 1956, it was based in New York City until 1995 when it moved to Chicago. The company's headquarters and dance academy are in Joffrey Tower, and it performs its October–May season at the Auditorium Theatre. In 2020 the company will move its performance venue to Chicago's Civic Opera House through an arrangement with the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\nIn 1956, a time during which most touring companies performed only reduced versions of ballet classics, Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino formed a six-dancer ensemble that toured the country in a station wagon pulling a U-Haul trailer, performing original ballets created by Joffrey. The original six dancers were Arpino, Dianne Consoer, Brunilda Ruiz, Glen Tetley, Beatrice Tompkins, and John Wilson. While Joffrey stayed in New York City to teach ballet classes and earn money to pay the dancers' salaries, Arpino led the troupe. The ensemble first performed in a major city in Chicago in 1957. The Joffrey Ballet eventually settled down in New York City, under the name the Robert Joffrey Theatre Ballet. In 1962 modern choreographer Alvin Ailey was invited to make a work for the company. Rebekah Harkness was an important early benefactor and she made international touring possible (Soviet Union, 1963). But in 1964 she and Joffrey parted ways.\n\nJoffrey started again, building up a new company that made its debut in 1965 as the Joffrey Ballet. Following a successful season at the New York City Center in 1966, it was invited to become City Center's resident ballet company with Joffrey as artistic director and Arpino as chief choreographer. Arpino's 1970 rock ballet \"Trinity\" was well received; Joffrey revived Kurt Jooss's \"The Green Table\" in 1967, followed by revivals of Ashton's \"Façade\", Cranko's \"Pineapple Poll\", Fokine's \"Petrushka\" (with Rudolf Nureyev), Nijinsky's \"Afternoon of a Faun\", also with Nureyev, and Massine's \"Le Tricorne\", \"Le Beau Danube\" and \"Parade\". In 1973 Joffrey asked Twyla Tharp to create her first commissioned ballet, \"Deuce Coupe\". The company continued as City Center Joffrey Ballet until 1977. From 1977, it performed as the Joffrey Ballet, with a second home established in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1992. In 1995, the company left New York City for Chicago to establish a permanent residence there. \nThe first few years in Chicago were financially arduous for the company, nearly causing it to close several times, but audiences later became larger and younger. In 2005 the Joffrey Ballet celebrated its 10th anniversary in Chicago and in 2007 concluded a two-season-long 50th-anniversary celebration, including a \"River to River\" tour of free, outdoor performances across Iowa, sponsored by Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe Joffrey Ballet was the first dance company to perform at the White House at Jacqueline Kennedy’s invitation, the first to appear on American television, the first classical dance company to use multi-media, the first to create a ballet set to rock music, the first to appear on the cover of TIME magazine, and the first company to have had a major motion picture based on it, Robert Altman’s \"The Company\". In Robert Altman's penultimate film, \"The Company\", Malcolm McDowell played the ballet company's artistic director, a character based on Gerald Arpino. The film is composed of stories gathered from the actual dancers, choreographers, and staff of the Joffrey Ballet. Most of the roles are played by actual company members.\n\nThe Joffrey Ballet appeared in the motion picture \"Save the Last Dance\" (2001), when the two protagonists of the story saw the company perform \"Sea Shadow\" and \"Les Présages\" in Chicago.\n\nIn \"Glee\" (2012), character Mike Chang is given a scholarship to attend the Joffrey Academy of Dance in Chicago.\n\nIn fall 1987 the Joffrey Ballet premiered a reconstructed version of Igor Stravinsky's seminal ballet \"The Rite of Spring\" in the city of Los Angeles. The original ballet debuted in 1913 in Paris, France, and was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky. Dance experts Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer spent 18 years gathering research on the original ballet in order to properly reconstruct it. Eighty percent of the original costumes were located and reconstructed for the performance, and Hodson and Archer were able to consult with Nijinsky's rehearsal assistant Marie Rambert on the original choreography, before her death in 1982.\n\n the company comprised 40 dancers, performs its regular September–May season at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, and engages in several domestic and international tours throughout the year. Its repertoire consists of both classical and contemporary pieces, as well as annual December performances of \"The Nutcracker\", presented in conjunction with the Chicago Philharmonic. Since 2016 the company has presented the version of \"The Nutcracker\" it commissioned from choreographer Christopher Wheeldon which is re-set at the time of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nIn 2007 Gerald Arpino retired from day-to-day operations, becoming artistic director emeritus until his death in 2009. In October 2007 former Joffrey dancer Ashley Wheater, assistant artistic director and ballet master for San Francisco Ballet, became the third artistic director. In 2019, the Joffery presented the world premiere of an entirely new \"story ballet\" based on \"Anna Karenina\". Choreographed by Yuri Possokhov, the Joffrey and The Australian Ballet also commissioned from composer Ilya Demutsky a new full-length orchestral score, the first in the Joffrey's history.\n\nThe Joffrey is located in Joffrey Tower, at 10 East Randolph Street in downtown Chicago. The company has an extensive touring schedule, an education program including the Joffrey Academy of Dance, Official School of The Joffrey Ballet, Community Engagement program, and collaborations with other visual and performing arts organizations. In 2020, the Joffrey plans to move from the Auditorium and begin a performance partnership with the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\n\n\n"}

Created by the Federal Government of Mexico in 1951, to meet the need of 25.8 million people with 21.4 thousand kilometers of roads at that moment; It is currently owned by Grupo Empresarial G and its subsidiaries since 1989. The company has gone through several stages of production of different freight and passenger transport models throughout its history, thanks to different technological and commercial agreements and partnerships with different companies. International companies such as Fiat, Renault, Flexible, Cummins, Perkins, Chrysler, Caterpillar, Scania, MCI, Skoda, Spicer, Eaton, Dana. As of today, its main production is focused on buses for urban and foreign use, and they have developed their truck technology with a subsidiary of BMW.\n\nCurrently tens of thousands of trucks and buses, reaching 20% of the national vehicle fleet, circulate along different roads and highways in Mexico, including in some Latin American countries as well.\n\nDINA was founded as Diesel Nacional S.A in 1951, by the Federal Government of Mexico, through its Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and its Ministry of Economy. It approves the constitution of the company Diesel Nacional, SA, with a duration of 45 years and a capital stock of 75 million Mexican pesos, which was contributed by the private initiative and the Mexican Government, the latter being the majority shareholder, its plant was installed in the Fray Bernardino de Sahagún City in the State of Hidalgo, Mexico.\n\nIn 1952, Diesel Nacional signed manufacturing and technical assistance agreements with the Italian automaker Fiat S.p.A., whose result was the production of the first assembled units: the 682 / T tractor-truck, later production was extended to the automotive segment with the FIAT 600, FIAT 1 100 and FIAT 1 400B models. Meanwhile, the passenger transportation segment started with model 682 RN bus in 1956; but the high assembly production costs of Fiat vehicles forced the cancellation of the contract in January 1960. \n\nIn 1961, another important association was started with the U.S. company The Flxible Corporation, which allowed obtaining the license to build two bus models in Mexico, the Flxible Hi-Level and the Flxliner, which would be known in Mexico as the DINA 311 \"Hunchback\" and the Olympic Dina respectively.\n\nIn 1962, the Mexican federal government imposed certain limitations on the automotive industry in the country, which included the imposition of tariff barriers on the importation of vehicles that would enter the Mexican nation, for both freight and passenger transportation, as well as obtaining their components from abroad, in such a way that the production companies in the country would obtain benefits from protectionist policies, a situation that would be favorable for DINA during the following three decades of production. Other regulation policies in the market would serve as an important factor for the export of freight transportation vehicles to several Latin American countries starting from the 70s.\n\nIn 1968, the national production of the NT and NH engines of the Cummins company was started. In 1973 it buys 60% of the shares of Motores Perkins S. A., established in Mexico, to counteract its main competitor, Chrysler, which previously owned that shares.\nIn 1987, a technological alliance was signed with Navistar International. Two years later DINA was acquired by the Consortium \"G\" Group DINA, though it continued to use Navistar engines.\n\nBeing a production and assembly company of engines, and above all when obtaining tariff protection, DINA obtained significant agreements with Mexican companies that produced freight trucks and foreign transportation sector, from the 70s, mainly with the companies CASA (Carrocerías de Aluminio SA), CATOSA (Carrocerías Toluca S.A.) (currently OperBus) and CAPRE (Carrocerías Preconstruidas S.A., currently NovaCapre).\n\nIn 1974, the Maquiladora Automotriz Nacional Company (MAN) was formed to assemble Pick-up trucks with the DINA brand, of which the 1000, 3000 and 3200 models were manufactured, all with International´s Scout model technology and with Perkins engines. Later the DINA trucks were manufactured with body similar to Chevrolet 's Custom. MAN closed truck production in 1983. \n\nDue to the growing demand and diversified in its line of products, from 1976 different commercial divisions were created within the same Diesel National SA, remaining as the main controller and forming a decentralized parastatal corporate group. As a result of this process, the corporate was mainly composed of different operating groups:\n\nDuring the early 80s, the industry in the production of buses and freight transportation was monopolized in Mexico, being mainly concentrated in the hands of DINA and Mexicana de Autobuses S.A. (MASA), one of the reasons for maintaining a certain position in the market is the use of unfair competition practices on other companies with prices below their real cost and for the consolidation of the tariff restrictions imposed by the federal government previously, this as a result of the strong economic crises in the country that began in 1982, a situation that would be less favorable for domestic companies constituted by private investment. In this way, companies such as Sultana, another bus manufacturing company, would have to suspend production and temporarily close its plants in 1982. \n\nIn 1981, DINA and Navistar (now International) entered into a technology cooperation contract. The result was the introduction of model S-series trucks, the 7400, 7800 and 9400. In 1985 it formed a partnership with General Motors for the manufacture and export of vehicles and assembly parts. And it was during that decade when DINA Autobuses managed to reach the peak of sales in the hands of its CEO, Mr. Miguel Ángel Anguiano Rodríguez.\nIn 1987, after several years of commercialization of the “Dina Olímpico” in the bus sector, a new model was launched, the D-350 G-7, which would later be known as the “Dina Avante”, model that was based on the Eagle 15 adapting some features of the Flxible bodies. Other variations from the same model were released: “Dina Dorado” and “Avante Plus”, in later years.\n\nAlthough the situation for the corporative company reflected some main control in the market, this would be complicated due to the economic problems that occurred during the 80s in Mexico, the general production at the end of 1986 had been paralyzed mostly due to the decrease of the supply. These problems would also cause no possibility of continuing to invest in the modernization of new equipment and maintenance. During 1987, the process of de-incorporation of the companies formed by the corporation began, with the sale and closing of some companies, Dina Motores was entirety purchased by its foreign minority investor Cummins, other incorporated companies such as Mexicana de Autobuses were sold to a group of entrepreneurs. In this way, from 1988 to 1989, the corporate liquidation process of DINA was carried out, which in reality would end with the official sale of the existing companies in the group (trucks, engines, plastics and buses) in a stock package. Completing the operation and control of DINA by the Mexican state, after 38 years of operations.\n\nIn 1989 the parastatal Diesel Nacional, S.A. (trucks, engines, plastics and buses) was acquired by Consorcio Grupo G S.A. de C.V., owned by the Rafael (†), Armando, Guillermo, Alfonso and Raymundo Gómez Flores brothers, from Jalisco state, Mexico. The Gómez Flores family was a shareholder in Mexicana de Autobuses S.A. (MASA), through Motor Coach Industries (MCI).\n\nDuring the first years in which the company was privatized, it was possible to maintain commercial relations with partners who had obtained agreements during its stage as a parastatal company. Thus, in 1991, DINA introduced the NAVISTAR series DTA-360 and DTA-466 engines into the freight trucks and buses segment. In 1992, and filled in its production capacity, a commercial and technological agreement with the Brazilian company Marcopolo SA, is necessary to deliver trucks from the concept of semi-knock-down and know-down to be sufficient with the new bus orders of its customers. Marcopolo was a leading company in the production and sales of buses in South America at that time; the results of this agreement would be the bodies manufacture for the Marcopolo Paradiso and Viaggio models for the Mexican market, with a 10 years duration. In 1993, exports of these models to Central and South America began. \n\nChrysler had an equity percentage and sales through its dealers. Grupo G acquired these shares and consolidated its own network of distributors. Navistar was also liquidated in its shareholding.\n\nIn 1994, the DINA Composites, S.A. of C.V. company was established with the purpose of developing plastic technologies for the automotive industry.\n\nThus in that same year, Grupo G acquires the assembly plants of Motor Coach Industries International to facilitate exports to the North American market. Manufacturer that for many years was the largest producer of long distance and tourism vehicles in the United States of America and Canada, where it has plants in Winnipeg and North Dakota, being the Greyhound bus the most recognized and American national symbol.\n\nIn 1996, it introduced Caterpillar CAT engines, instead of the Navistar ones. Caterpillar was persuaded to enter the market for commercial freight and passenger vehicles.\n\nIn 1997 it inaugurated its truck and bus assembly plant in the industrial zone of the Mercedes town, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, becoming the company \"International Dina\" in \"DIMEX\" as a subsidiary of DINA Camiones S.A. de C.V. of Mexico. Negotiations to operate in that country took place since two years before. The production started with the assembly of the S-series model trucks, imported from its Mexican headquarters; the commercialization of trucks had achieved a 5% and 1% in buses and trucks in 1998, based on the Argentine automotive market of that year. In April 1999, the production, assembly and commercialization of its own range of HTQ (High Technology and Quality) of chassis and trucks in that country began, D1416, D1721 and D1725.\n\nWith the growth of the company, different operating groups would be integrated as DINA subsidiaries, as had been done when the corporate was federally owned in the 80s. At the end of the 90s the company would be integrated by different subsidiaries and operations groups:\nMeanwhile in the Mexican headquarters of DINA, in 1997, new models of buses and trucks were built in the Sahagún plant, based on their own designs and totally Mexican, in the bus segment the F11 models, in 1998 the F12 model, and in 1999 the F14 model, and for the truck segment the HTQ series (models 55117572, 66121072, 77631072, 9400 and 65019570), are developed; all with its own technologies for the North American market. The development of the new HTQ series was jointly designated by Design Works, a subsidiary of BMW, MCII and Roush Industries USA, with an investment of almost US $100 million.\n\nIn October 1999 Sterling Trucks of Freightliner LLC (subsidiaries of Daimler) acquired the Canadian company Western Star, with the sole purpose of breaking it so that it in turn damaged DINA Trucks, since it had signed an agreement with DINA for the production of 9,000 freight trucks. \nOn February 7, 2000, the strike of the Sindicato Nacional Independiente de Trabajadores de la Industria Automotriz, Similares y Conexos, broke out, whose main request would be the 24% increase in direct salary increase, when the company could only offer 13% more 2% in benefits. Concluding three days later with the acceptance of 13% increase. \n\nOn July 20, 2000 Western Star Trucks was acquired by Freightliner, the reaction was that contracts contracted with DINA were reviewed in October 1999 that contemplated the assembly of HTQ trucks to re-market trucks in the North American market. Once acquired Western Star by Freightliner, it decides to cancel the contract with DINA unilaterally and only 700 units were manufactured for sale in North America, instead of the 9,000 units contracted. The workers of the company began a strike again on October 6, 2000, extended until March 6, 2001; demanding 40% salary increase. On October 28, DINA filed a claim for breach of contract with Western Star Trucks before the International Chamber of Commerce for USD $ 110 million, and on January 31, 2001 it announced cuts of 6% of its workers followed by a 40 % of layoffs in April 2001.\n\nIn February 2001, the resizing of the company DINA Trucks for the recovery of their regular operations without the contract of Western Star was evident. On September 11, 2001, the DINA Trucks plant in Ciudad Sahagún, Hidalgo, was definitively closed because of the termination of a 52-year union of the Federal Government; the strategy for the purchase of the collective contract with the union that had many vices of the past and was highly inefficient was initiated.\n\nAlso the plants had more than 80 hectares that were oversized; it was decided to sell them and liquidate the union and the company was left with only 23 hectares, which was what was really needed for production.\n\nThe government of the state of Hidalgo in charge of Manuel Ángel Núñez Soto, took charge of the assets of the company, only of DINA Camiones, liquidating its 559 workers in the year 2002.\n\nAs of 2001, in order to avoid an economic definitive bankruptcy, a group of administrative people of Grupo Empresarial G, owners of what was left of that company at that time, would carry out the financial restructuring of DINA Camiones, this process consisted first of the sale of the plants that the group still had in property. In 2002, the government of the state of Hidalgo would buy the facilities of the DINA Camiones plant, as well as in 2005, a group of Argentine businessmen would buy the facilities of the DINA plant in Argentina. Subsequently, the economic problem that had arisen due to the cancellation of the contract with Western Star Trucks, were settled by legal means, when Freightliner would pay a strong compensation to the Mexican company, in an amount that was never disclosed because it was part of the agreement between both companies. \n\nIn 2004, the process of designing new passenger units with chassis and bodywork designed by the company began, based on HTQ technology, as well as on national and international standards, to be consistent with the performance and conditions on the roads of Mexico. \n\nStarting in 2007, the first five prototypes of the chassis are concluded, then, the design and construction of a new plant begins, as well as the equipment and tools necessary for the online manufacture of new buses, in the same industrial zone of Ciudad Sahagún, state of Hidalgo, Mexico. In July 2007, the first completed unit leaves the production line of the new DINA plant, whose purpose would be to carry out tests on different roads, before putting them for production and final marketing. \n\nIn May 2008, the definitive operational restart of DINA Camiones was announced to the Mexican press with the production and commercialization of four new bus models, all of them of urban type: DINA Linner; Runner; Picker and Outsider. \n\nAt the time of restarting operations in that year, the investment was USD $ 100 million, having a plant with the capacity to produce 23 units per day, 450 direct and 750 indirect jobs, and five concessionaires in different states of the country to commertialize their units into the Mexican market.\n\nTo this day, the company maintains its operations by offering different products and services for transport, always keeping the urban and foreign bus market primary, although also considering alternatives where the company can occupy one place in the market. The latter would be considered for the launch of a gas-powered bus, the DINA Linner G in the year 2010, as well as the launch of a specific cargo truck, the DINA Hustler in the year 2011, a tractor-truck for the use of container transport in commercial ports.\n\nBy increasing their participation in the Mexican market once again, DINA would cross borders once again by exporting units to some countries in Central America (until now without being able to consolidate again in all of Latin America), where certain models of the company currently circulate. Thus, by increasing its commercial presence, other bus models would be launched in 2013, this time marking the return to the foreign transport segment, the DINA Buller.\n\n• Family of light, medium and heavy trucks HTQ, class 5, 6, 7 and 8;\n• Yard tractor-truck for ports;\n• Family of urban buses Liner: 8, 10, 12 to Diesel and Natural gas, rear engine;\n• Family of urban buses Runer: 8, 9, 10, 11 to Diesel and Natural gas, front engine;\n• Family of urban buses Picker: 8, 10 m to Diesel and Natural gas, front engine;\n• Family Bus Rapid Transit, urban buses, from 12 to 18 m, Brighter and Rider models, to Diesel and Natural gas, rear engine;\n• Trolleybus Rider 12 m low floor;\n• Long distance bus Buller of 12 m to Diesel rear engine (in development for reintroduction to that market);\n• Model Outsider bus, rear engine, 11 m to Diesel, suburban;\n• Urban bus Silux of 8 m to Diesel, rear engine.\n\n• Post-sale; \n• Warranty; \n• Spare parts;\n• Financing;\n• Training for customers about their DINA products.\n\nThrough its history Dina has produced a great variety of buses for the passenger sector.\n• 311 FLEXIBLE\n• Olímpico\n• Avante\n• Avante Plus\n• Dorado\n• Citus\n• Marcopolo Paradiso\n• Marcopolo Viaggio\n• Foráneo 11\n• Foráneo 12\n• Foráneo 14\n• CATOSA Puma\n• CATOSA Pacífico\n• CATOSA Atlántico\n• CATOSA Tollocan MT\n• Casabus\n• Eurocar HR\n• Eurocar BR2000\n• Ayco Magno MC\n• 231 Convencional\n• CAPRE 500 Convencional\n• CATOSA 500 Convencional Sansón\n• Chasis D-1622\n• Chasis D-1422\n• Chasis D-1116\n\n• HTQ Runner 8 - Front engine\n• HTQ Runner 9 - Front engine\n• HTQ Runner 9G - Front engine / Natural gas\n• HTQ Runner 10 - Front engine\n• HTQ Linner 10 - Rear engine\n• HTQ Linner G - Rear engine / Natural gas\n• HTQ Picker - Front engine\n• HTQ Outsider - Rear engine\n• BRighTer - Bus Rapid Transport\n• Ridder\n• Ridder G\n• Ridder E (Trolleybus)\n• Hustler\n• Buller\n\n• Trolebús de Guadalajara (SITREN Línea 3 at Guadalajara City)\n• Transregio (Monterrey City, natural gas buses)\n• Metrobus (Mexico City, articulated units)\n• Grupo Martínez (transport operator at state of Nuevo Leon, natural gas buses)\n• Grupo Trees (Monterrey City, natural gas buses)\n• Estrella Blanca (Conexión, outsiders)\n• Acabús (Acapulco City, integrated transportation system)\n• Red de Transporte de Pasajeros (Mexico City)\n• Grupo Senda (business transport units)\n• Transportes Vencedor (business transport units)\n• Transportes Roca de Juárez (business transport units)\n• Transportes Unidos Costa Pacífico (Puerto Vallarta City, gas and diesel units, integrated system)\n• Lipu (business transport units)\n• Among others\n\n• Managua, Nicaragua (replacement of yellow buses) \n• Colombia, natural gas units and shuttle service in Medellín City (SAO) \n• SSA Marine, Long Beach, CA, USA (Yard tractor-trucks) \n• Among others\n"}

At its height as a New Zealand owned company Navman employed 300 staff at its headquarters in Auckland.\n\nNavman was acquired by Brunswick Corporation in June 2004 and become part of Brunswick New Technology. The company struggled to turn a profit and a mass exodus of senior management staff ensued.\nThe Navman Marine division designs and manufactures fish finders, sonar, VHF radios, autopilots and sailing instruments and was sold by Brunswick to the Norwegian company Navico in April 2007.\nThe Navman PND (Portable Navigation Device) division was sold to MiTAC International Corporation in the first half of 2007 and this business retains principal use of the Navman brand, including the navman.com website.

The flagship S90i model contained a built-in 2-megapixel camera for use with NavPix, something that has not reappeared on later flagship Navman devices.\nJune 2008: F-Series. The F15 is an entry level slim PND sold exclusively through RadioShack stores in the US. Key features of the F15: 3.5\" Touch Screen, New UI based on the MioMaps GPS software by MiTAC owned Mio Technology, Maps of US and Puerto Rico, SiRFInstantFixII, and preloaded POIs. A version with a larger 4.3\" screen, the F25 was sold in Europe, with a set of western Europe maps. Support from Navman/MiTAC was largely absent for this device.\n\nJanuary 2007: F-Series. The F30, F40 and F50 models were added. Based on the existing F20 unit, these new models were bundled with a variety of external modules to add new features out of the box. The F30 included a T1 traffic module to offer traffic (TMC) alerts. The F40 included a B2 module to offer Bluetooth handsfree calling. The F50 included a B2+ module offering both traffic (TMC) and Bluetooth.\n\n2006: N-Series. Replacing the previous iCN 500 and iCN 700 series, the N40i and N60i are fully touch screen with nearest fuel and parking buttons and NavPix. The N60i was the top-range unit and has a wide, 4.3” screen. N-Series also had a third member, N20—intended as a replacement to 530 it suffered as the F20 cannibalised its sales.\n\n2006: F20. Replacing the iCN 300 series, the F20 is small, fully touch screen and includes the nearest petrol and parking buttons. The F20 was essentially Navman's volume product, selling in great quantities, especially during the Christmas 2006 period.\n\nIn 2005, Navman replaced the 600 series with the 700 Series, consisting of the iCN 720 and iCN 750. The only difference between the two models was map storage—720 relied on memory cards while 750 had a 4 Gb built-in microdrive. It had a wide screen, was fully touch screen with no stylus, and included the nearest petrol and parking buttons. It was the first Navman unit with NavPix. Upon introduction of the 700 series, support was dropped for the 600 series essentially rendering the 600 series obsolete as there would be no additional map updates or product support available.\n\nThe original top-range units were those of the 600 Series. These are larger than the 300 and 500 units, offering louder sound and a wider, automotive grade screen. They are not touch screen, but are known for being strong and easy to see. The 600 units are the 610, 620, 630, 635 and 650. The 650 came with a built-in 2 GB microdrive and was also OEMed for Delphi and Sony.\n\nThe 500 Series was originally the middle of Navman’s range. It includes the iCN 510, 520, 530 and 550. They are touch-screen, and are usually operated with a stylus. The 550 introduced Navman’s unique nearest petrol and parking buttons, worldwide maps and real-time traffic updates. 530 was the last in the 500 Series introducing hardware styling later found on N-Series.\n\nThe 300 Series is Navman’s original range of basic, in-car satellite navigation units. It includes the iCN (in-car navigator) 320 and 330. The 320 introduced 2D moving maps, while the 330 had 3D moving maps.\n\nNavman has also made a number of Pocket PCs in the past, known as the PiN Series, running from the PiN 200/Pin 300 to 570. They were not popular, however, and have long since been discontinued.\n\nThe TMC Accessory Kit equips the Navman S30 3D with TMC (Traffic Message Channel, this is, traffic alerts & re-routing). The MY TMC is for Navman MY30. S Series Platinum TMC Accessory Kit is compatible with the latest Platinum range S100/150/200 & the Classic S45 and S35.\n\nThe MY30, MY50T, MY55T, MY500XT, S300T, S200, S150, S100, S45, S35, S90i, S80, S30 and S50 have TMC built-in.\n\nNavman introduced \"NavPix\" on its iCN 700 portable navigation devices in 2006. Navman was the first company worldwide to introduce NavPix (on which they hold a patent). The NavPix technology combines a digital image with geographical data to create the NavPix image, which is a record of the exact location where that image was taken. The iCN 720 and iCN 750 were the first Navman GPS products that were NavPix-enabled, using a 1.3 MegaPixel camera to take the NavPix.\n\nNavPix was developed to offer users an alternative way to navigate, by selecting an image rather than entering an address or post code.\n\nThe N Series - N for NavPix - products launched in September 2006, introduced two more NavPix-enabled products - the N40i and wide-screen N60i, both of which had an integrated digital camera to take the NavPix. The N20 model can use NavPix images, but not take them.\n\nThe NavPix image contains the latitude and longitude information within the Exif metadata. These images can be selected on the compatible Navman as an alternative way to define a destination or way-point when planning a route.\n\nThe latest Navman sat nav, the S90i offers a 2.0 MegaPixel camera for taking NavPix. Other S-Series models, the S50 and S70, are NavPix compatible meaning NavPix images can be loaded onto the device for use.\n\nNavPix images may be freely accessed from the Navman NavPix Library as well as other sites such as Flickr.\n\nNavman's Marine Division was acquired by Navico, the world's largest marine electronics company, and is the parent company to leading marine electronics brands: Lowrance, Simrad and B&G. Navico has approximately 1,500 employees globally and distribution in more than 100 countries worldwide. The original core technology and product research and development centre that was Navman remains today intact in the Auckland, New Zealand operation. This is where a number of next generation product platforms are developed and launched for use across the B&G, Lowrance, and Simrad brands. \n\nThe Navman brand was discontinued after a period of time in favour of the North American favoured Northstar brand.\n\n"}

The population of the municipality was approximately 36,717 (from the 2011 census), with the city of Torres Novas (seat of the municipality) has about 15,000 inhabitants in an area that econompasses .\n\nThe earliest sign of human life in Portugal is the 400,000 year old skull discovered at the Cave of Aroeira in 2017.\nThe territory of Torres Novas was settled as early as the Paelothic in areas situated along the margins of the karstic network of the River Almonda, such as the grottos in Buraca da Moura, Buraca da Oliveira and Lapa da Bugalheira.\n\nDuring the primordial period before Roman occupation, there were various \"villae\" that were populated in the region. Vila Cardílio, a Luso-Roman settlement was occupied in the first or second century A.D. Along with Avita, archaeologists discovered coloured mosaics, coins, sculptures and Latin inscriptions, where one was inscribed with felicitous remarks to the \"villa da torre\" (\"town of the tower\"), an expression associated with the plausible origin for the toponymy \"Torres Novas\".\n\nFollowing the 12th century, the territory was known as \"Turris\" began to develop into its actual limits, with the expulsion of the Moors by forces loyal to 1148. The foundation of the municipality was attributed to the foral issued on 1 October 1190, by King Sancho.\n\nThe castle which had, by that time, been in ruins was reconstructed by King Fernando, to halt Castilian forces during the Iberian wars.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the territory grew demographically and economically, receiving a \"Carta de Feira\" (authorizing a fair for this market) in 1263.\n\nThe lands of Torres Novas passed into the possessions of Queen Isabel of Aragon in 1304 (who was transferred into her title by King Denis. In the following years, Torres Novas was a meeting point for sessions of the Cortes, and historical points in the kingdoms history, like the wedding between Infanta Beatriz and Infante Henrique, children of King Fernando I and King João I of Castilo (in 1380); the establishment of regency of Queen Leonor of Aragon Aragon (due to the death of King Edward I), during the reign of Afonso V (1438); and the decisions of the Cortes, which gathered intermittently in Torres Novas, to manage the Kingdom's issues (1525).\n\nIsabel of Avis was the donatário at the first half of the 15th century, receiving a new foral, during the reign of Manuel I of Portugal (1510).\n\nIn the following decade, John of Lancaster was given the title of the first Marquis of Torres Novas, along with the Duke of Aveiro (which were both extinguished in 1759, following the attempted regicide of Joseph I, associated with José Mascarenhas da Silva e Lencastre). The monarch survived the attempted assassination.\n\nThe king's daughter later conceded a license to Henrique Meuron and David Suabe to install \"Fábrica das Chitas\" (1783), which was later destroyed by General Massena, during the third French campaign along the Iberian peninsula (1810).\n\nThe economy within Torres Novas continued along the 19th century, with some successes and failures: the founding of the \"Fábrica de Papel do Almonda\" (1818); establishment of the \"Companhia de Fiação de Torres Novas\" (1845); the creation of the transporter \"João Clara & Companhia (Irmãos) Lda.\" which, at the time of its nationalization (1975), was domianted by \"Clara Transportes - S.A.R.L.\".\n\nThe inauguration of the raillink between Torres Novas and Alcanena occurred in 1893, and was one of the most curious episode in the business and troubled history of the area.\n\nThe municipality of Torres Novas, situated in the Médio Tejo subregion, with its neighbours Entroncamento, Tomar, Abrantes, Ourém and Fátima.\n\nAdministratively, The city of Torres Novas is the seat of the municipality, that is divided into 10 civil parishes civil parishes:\nFour of the parishes were included in the city of Torres Novas.

{"id": "1811508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811508", "title": "Iron law of prohibition", "text": "Iron law of prohibition\n\nThe iron law of prohibition is a term coined by Richard Cowan in 1986 which posits that as law enforcement becomes more intense, the potency of prohibited substances increases. Cowan put it this way: \"the harder the enforcement, the harder the drugs.\"\n\nThis law is an application of the Alchian–Allen effect; Libertarian judge\nJim Gray calls the law the \"cardinal rule of prohibition\", and notes that is a powerful argument for the legalization of drugs. It is based on the premise that when drugs or alcohol are prohibited, they will be produced in black markets in more concentrated and powerful forms, because these more potent forms offer better efficiency in the business model—they take up less space in storage, less weight in transportation, and they sell for more money. Economist Mark Thornton writes that the iron law of prohibition undermines the argument in favor of prohibition, because the higher potency forms are less safe for the consumer.\nThornton published research showing that the potency of marijuana increased in response to higher enforcement budgets. He later expanded this research in his dissertation to include other illegal drugs and alcohol during Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933). The basic approach is based on the Alchian and Allen Theorem. This argument says that a fixed cost (e.g. transportation fee) added to the price of two varieties of the same product (e.g. high quality red apple and a low quality red apple) results in greater sales of the more expensive variety. When applied to rum-running, drug smuggling, and blockade running the more potent products become the sole focus of the suppliers. Thornton notes that the greatest added cost in illegal sales is the avoidance of detection. Thornton says that if drugs are legalized, then consumers will begin to wean themselves off the higher potency forms, for instance with cocaine users buying coca leaves, and heroin users switching to opium.\n\nThe popular shift from beer to wine to hard liquor during the US Prohibition era has a parallel in the narcotics trade in the late 20th century. Bulky opium was illegal, so refined heroin became more prevalent, albeit with significant risk from blood-borne disease because of injection by needle, and far greater risk of death from overdose. Marijuana was also found too bulky and troublesome to smuggle across borders, so smugglers turned to refined cocaine with its much higher potency and profit per pound. Cowan wrote in 1986 that crack cocaine was entirely a product of the prohibition of drugs. Clinical psychiatrist Michael J. Reznicek adds crystal meth to this list. In the 2010s the iron law has been invoked to explain why heroin is displaced by fentanyl and other, even stronger, synthetic opioids.\n\nWith underage drinking by teens in the U.S., one of the impacts of laws against possession of alcohol by minors is that teens tend to prefer distilled spirits, because they are easier to conceal than beer.\n\nConsider the situation where there are two goods formula_1 and formula_2, which are the higher quality and lower quality goods with formula_3 - the higher quality good has a higher price. Each of these goods has a compensated demand curve - a demand curve which holds utility constant - of the form:formula_4We will also assume that income is held constant, because income effects are indeterminate in forecasting changes in demand. Suppose that there is an associated cost formula_5 per item that is added to each good due to transport costs. We want to know how the ratio of demand formula_6 changes for the two goods based on formula_5. Taking the derivative with respect to formula_5 gives us:formula_9From our assumptions, we have that the total price for each item is formula_10. Therefore, we may compute formula_11 to be:formula_12Define formula_13. We may rewrite the last equation to be:formula_14Finally, let's define the elasticity formula_15 to be:formula_16Now we may rewrite the change in the price ratio with respect to the cost in its final form:formula_17We want to show that formula_18, but seem to be stuck with elasticities that are indeterminate. However, Hicks' third law of demand gives us that:formula_19To see why this is, suppose that we take a more general version of the compensated demand function with formula_20 goods and compensated demand curve formula_21.  For a homogeneous function formula_22 of degree formula_23, defined as:formula_24Euler's homogeneous function theorem states that:formula_25Demand functions are homogeneous of degree 0 - if all prices and income are multiplied by formula_26, then the consumer's demand for goods remains the same - which implies that in the general formula_20 good case:formula_28Dividing by the good stock formula_29 then gives us:formula_30Thereby establishing Hicks' third law of demand. And from this law, we may use formula_31 and formula_32 to show that:formula_33Therefore, we may conclude using the earlier identities that:formula_34But this last inequality was just our starting assumption! This implies that as the transport costs increase, the higher quality good will become more prevalent than the lower quality good. In the drug-specific context, as costs associated with drug enforcement increase, the more potent drug will become more prevalent in the illegal drug market.\n\n"}

The village of Vila Nova da Barquinha, which is the seat of the municipality, has about 3500 inhabitants.\n\nThe present Mayor is Vítor Miguel Pombeiro, elected by the Socialist Party. The municipal holiday is June 13.\n\nAlthough some villages of Vila Nova da Barquinha are ancient, the development of the region is strongly related to the Reconquista period, when the river Tagus, which flows through the South of the municipality, was the border between the dominions of Christians and Moors. In the 12th century, the defence of this border was in charge of the Knights Templar, who built several castles along the river. One of these is the Castle of Almourol, built by the Master of the Portuguese Templars, Gualdim Pais, in 1171. The picturesque castle is located on an island in the Tagus river and can be visited by boat. Nowadays it is the most visited historical site in Vila Nova da Barquinha.\nIn the end of the 13th century, when the Reconquista was finished, the importance of the castles of the region declined. The villages along the Tagus then became important fluvial ports for the transport of agricultural goods of the region to Lisbon. In the 16th century, the port of the village of Tancos became the most important of all, being granted a foral (letter of feudal rights) in 1517 by King Manuel I. From the early 16th century date the main church (\"matriz\") of the village of Atalaia, with a magnificent portal and interior in Renaissance style.\n\nThe village of Vila Nova da Barquinha, current seat of the municipality, was created in the 17th century around a fluvial port (hence the name \"Barquinha\" = \"Barca\" = Boat). In the 18th and 19th centuries the village became the most important in the region, and it was turned into the seat of the municipality in 1836. The importance of the river in the development of the municipality is reflected in its coat-of-arms, which shows the picture of a boat. The arrival of the railway system in Portugal eventually led to the decadence of the fluvial commerce of the municipality.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n"}

The album is proceeded by their first video for the track \"Gloomy Daydreams\" on an earlier edit, with Gus G. on vocals.\n\nTheir second release, \"Descent into Chaos\", was released in 2005 and had a change of line up, with the addition of a more permanent rhythm section. Fotis Benardo (Septic Flesh, ex-Innerwish) took over on drums and Henric Carlsson, who also plays in the band Cipher System, on bass. Mikael Stanne, of Dark Tranquillity, provided a clean vocal section on the track \"Frozen\". Tomas Lindberg left the band so that a more full-time vocalist could accompany them on tours and studio albums.\n\nWhen Gus G was performing with Arch Enemy at Ozzfest 2005, he was replaced by Pierre Lysell for Nightrage's touring activities. For some of Nightrage's tour in support of Bolt Thrower, Gus G was again unavailable and his place was taken by Christian Muenzer, of Necrophagist. In March 2006, Gus G. permanently left Nightrage to focus completely on Firewind (later in 2009 becoming the guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne). At this time Fotis Benardo decided also to leave Nightrage and focus on the reunited Septic Flesh. He was replaced by Alex Svenningson.\n\nTheir third release, \"A New Disease Is Born\", was released in 2007. Gus G. was replaced by Dragonland/Amaranthe guitar virtuoso Olof Mörck. The song \"Scathing\" was chosen for the band's second video, and was directed by Bob Katsionis.\n\nAfter the release of \"A New Disease Is Born\" Alex Svenningson and Jimmie Strimell left the band to form the melodic metalcore band Dead by April. Longtime bassist Henric Karlsson also left the band due to his family obligations.\n\nVocalist Antony Hämäläinen, bassist Anders Hammer, and drummer Johan Nunez joined the band in the summer of 2007. Their fourth album, \"Wearing a Martyr's Crown\", was recorded, produced, and mixed by Fredrik Nordström at Studio Fredman for a 2009 release date.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, Nightrage released their third music video for the song \"Wearing a Martyr's Crown.\" The video was again directed by Bob Katsionis.\n\n\"A Grim Struggle\", \"Collision of Fate\", \"Shed the Blood\", and \"Wearing a Martyr's Crown\" were made available as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" video game series on Xbox. On 30 June 2011 \"A Grim Struggle\" was made available for download on the PlayStation 3 console.\n\nVengeance Descending is a double CD reissue of albums Sweet Vengeance and Descent into Chaos. The first disc features a bonus track called \"Gloomy Daydreams\", and the second one features \"Black Skies\", which was also a bonus track. Both tracks were previously only available in Japanese releases.\n\nIt was announced via Blabbermouth.net that former At the Gates and Nightrage vocalist Tomas Lindberg will be performing guest vocals for the new album entitled \"Insidious\". A short video clip of the session was added to YouTube. Other guests set to appear on the new album are Gus G, Tom Englund, Apollo Papathanasio and John K. Insidious was the first album since Sweet Vengeance to feature the original line up.\n\nAntony Hämäläinen spoke briefly about the album's direction in a recent interview with Deathmetalbaboon.com \"\"It sounds really heavy. Stripped down and in your face. The songs are a bit shorter and with fewer acoustic guitars than Wearing a Martyr’s Crown. It’s a very pissed off sound, so it’s going to be a really heavy record. Lots of guitar solos and melodies there too of course.\"\"\nThe album release dates were 26 September 2011 in Europe and 11 October 2011 in North America.\n\nOn 23 March the title track \"Insidious\" was made available as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" video game series on Xbox.\n\nOn 21 May the band released a new video for the track Delirium of the Fallen. The video was shot on 28 April at the Eightball Club in Thessaloniki, Greece. Directing of the clip was handled by Gabriel Psaltakis.\n\nStarting on 9 October 2011, the band supported the new album on a tour of North America with Firewind and Arsis, titled \"Frets Of Fury\".\n\nIn late April 2012, a tour of Europe alongside Demon Hunter and Deadlock was scheduled.\n\nAugust 2012, was the first time the band played Asia. Headlining the Daejeon Metal Festival in South Korea.\n\nAnnounced in April 2013, the band will headline a tour of Japan for the first time in their career. The tour is set to start on 5 November and will be titled \"\"Extreme metal over Japan\"\". Support for the six date trek will come from the Australian technical death metal band Psycroptic, American technical deathcore band The Faceless and French deathcore act In Arkadia.\n\nOlof Mörck has not been part of a live performance or band photography since 2011. It is assumed he has left the band to focus on his main project Amaranthe.\n\nIn 2013, Antony Hämäläinen officially left the band to pursue other musical ventures. Ronnie Nyman was recruited to replace Hämäläinen on vocals. With Nyman, the band released their sixth studio album, \"The Puritan\", in 2015.\n\nIn July 2016, Magnus Söderman (guitars), Francisco Escalona (bass), and Lawrence Dinamarca (drums) were announced as the newest members of Nightrage. The band recorded and released their seventh studio album, \"The Venomous\", in 2017. Their next album, \"Wolf to Man\", will be released on March 29, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811557", "title": "I Am Furious (Yellow)", "text": "I Am Furious (Yellow)\n\n\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" is the eighteenth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> thirteenth season. It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 28, 2002. In the episode, Bart creates a comic book series based on his father Homer's anger problems, which turns into a popular Internet cartoon series called \"Angry Dad\". Homer finds out about this and is at first outraged, but after talking to his family, he decides to try to become a less angry person.\n\nThe episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz and written by John Swartzwelder. The idea for the episode was pitched by Matt Selman, and the staff took inspiration for the episode from the \"Simpsons\" staff's own experience with web cartoons, such as \"Queer Duck\" and \"Hard Drinkin' Lincoln\". The episode includes references to the dot-com bubble, Danish physicist Niels Bohr and comic book publishers Marvel Comics and DC Comics. It also features American comic book writer Stan Lee as himself.\n\nBefore its original broadcast, \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" faced scrutiny from fans, who interpreted pre-release materials as suggesting that Homer would literally transform into the Hulk in the episode. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.8 million viewers, finishing in 26th place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nFollowing its home video release, \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" received positive reviews from critics, and is often considered a favorite among fans. \n\nA sequel to this episode, \"\", in which Bart and Homer make a short film based on \"Angry Dad\", aired in the United States on February 20, 2011.\n\nKirk Van Houten gives a speech to the kids at Springfield Elementary about his occupation of assistant flyer distributor. Due to the short and unengaging nature of his speech, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel take Lisa's advice and visit the Springfield Writer's Forum to find a better speaker, where they meet Jeff Jenkins, creator of the popular TV cartoon \"Danger Dog\". He comes to the school to give a presentation on \"Danger Dog\", which includes a sneak preview for the next Easter special, and fascinates the kids by telling them about the cartoon industry. Much to Skinner's horror, Jenkins tells the students how easy his job is, and how he has never needed to work hard, resulting in Skinner pulling a fire alarm to get the students out of the auditorium. Later, every kid in school creates their own comic books, all of which are rip-offs of \"Danger Dog\". Bart tries to sell his comic, \"Danger Dude\" (whose protagonist is also a dog), to Comic Book Guy at The Android's Dungeon, who flatly criticizes his work for being crude and derivative. Stan Lee enters the store and tells Bart that although his comic is bad, he should keep trying to \"find his own voice.\"\n\nAt home, Bart comes up with a character called \"Angry Dad\", a caricature of his father Homer and his frequent angry outbursts. Bart rolls out the first issue of \"Angry Dad\", which becomes a hit with the kids in school, although Lisa finds it insulting to their father's activities. The Comic Book Guy likes Bart's issue of Angry Dad and deems it shelf worthy to sell. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site who wants to make \"Angry Dad\" into an online animated cartoon series, and he agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. Homer remains unaware of \"Angry Dad\" until he finds out one day at work. Humiliated, Homer returns home and strangles Bart. Marge and Lisa stop Homer and calm him down, pointing out he has anger management issues. Lisa admits that while she dislikes \"Angry Dad\", she continues encouraging him to address them at once. He agrees to work on his anger issues by suppressing it from that point on and be a calmer father, disregarding Marge’s attempts to convince him to go on a diet.\n\nThe next day, Homer stays true to his word and remains calm, though his attempts to repress his rage causes lumps to develop on his neck. However, his new calm demeanor has taken away Bart's inspiration for his cartoon, so Bart and Milhouse set up a trap for Homer to trigger another outburst. Later, they go to the Internet company office, where they find the company has gone bankrupt. Realizing their mistake, they race back home to stop Homer from falling into the trap. Homer reaches home and happens upon Bart's trap, but he keeps his calm throughout its run, resulting in more lumps on his neck. The trap ends with Homer falling into a pool full of green paint just as Bart and Milhouse arrive, prompting him to go berserk and storm through town à la the incredible Hulk. The police restrain him and Homer is admitted to the hospital.\n\nWhen Marge scolds a remorseful Bart for causing $10 million worth of damage to the city with his trap, Dr. Hibbert arrives and discredits her by claiming that Bart actually saved Homer's life by enraging him. Hibbert explains the lumps on his neck were actually boils caused by suppressed rage and would have otherwise overwhelmed his system had Bart's prank not set him off with the right outburst he needed. He convinces a reluctant Marge to go easy on Bart (and let him punish her). Homer thanks Bart by taking him fishing, where he continues to make his father angry.\n\n\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Chuck Sheetz. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on April 28, 2002. The episode's storyline was pitched by \"Simpsons\" writer Matt Selman. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that Matt Groening, the creator of the series, would usually tell the writers about how he was the class clown and did not pay attention in school, and yet grew up to become very successful. After hearing this, Selman thought that if Groening went back to his school to talk about his career, it \"[would be] the last message that a principal and the teachers would wanna hear.\" Selman pitched the story because he thought it would be \"humorously infuriating\" to teachers. The episode was also partly based on some of the \"Simpsons\" staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as \"Queer Duck\" and \"Hard Drinkin' Lincoln\", both of which were created by Mike Reiss.\nThe \"Angry Dad\" internet cartoon, as well as the other internet cartoons in the episode, were originally going to be animated using Macromedia Flash, however, the department of Film Roman that handled Flash animation would not be able to complete the scenes in time. Because of this, director Sheetz had to draw the scenes himself, mimicking the look of Flash animation. At the end of Bart's trap, Homer falls into a pool of green paint, making him resemble the Hulk. Selman originally wanted Homer to fall into blue paint, since the blue paint mixed with his yellow skin would make green, however the idea never came to fruition.\n\nThe episode features comic book writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book \"\", Lee stated that he attended the episode's table read, and was impressed with the size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, \"Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife.\" Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called \"one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet.\" Lee continued, \"Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope.\" Lee would later guest star again as himself in \"Married to the Blob\" and \"The Caper Chase\". In a meta-joke, the character of the voice actor who plays Angry Dad is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, who also provides Homer's voice; the character's design is also a caricature of Castellaneta.\n\nThe title of the episode is a parody of 1967 Swedish art house film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\". The episode references the dot-com bubble, a speculative bubble covering roughly 1995–2000. In their article \"15 \"Simpsons\" Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras\", Genevieve Koski, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Sean O'Neal, Kyle Ryan and Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote: \"By April 2002, the dot-com bubble of the late '90s had been popped for a couple of years, taking with it myriad Internet start-ups. A sobering soul-searching settled in their place, which \"The Simpsons\" captured in this episode about Bart creating a popular Internet cartoon called \"Angry Dad\". Touring the laid-back start-up that hosts the cartoons, Lisa asks head honcho Todd Linux about their business model. 'How many shares of stock will it take to end this conversation?' he retorts. Lisa asks for two million, which Linux grabs from a paper-towel dispenser. When Bart and Lisa return later, the company has gone bust, and Linux is stealing copper wire out of the walls.\"\n\nWhen Stan Lee approaches Database, who is playing with a toy Batmobile, he asks him if he would rather prefer a more exciting action figure. Lee then begins shoving a The Thing action figure into the Batmobile, effectively destroying it. This scene pokes fun at the DC vs. Marvel rivalry (Batman's Batmobile of DC Comics and The Thing a property of Marvel Comics). Another scene in the episode references Danish physicist Niels Bohr. In his book \"What's Science Ever Done For Us: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe\", Paul Halpern wrote \"In the episode [...], one of Homer's favorite TV shows is preempted by the program \"The Boring World of Niels Bohr\". Homer is so upset that he clutches an ice-cream sandwich, aims it at the screen like it's a remote control, squeezes out its contents, and splatters Bohr's image. In contrast to Homer's reaction, most physicists heap nothing but accolades upon Bohr, whose revolutionary ideas shaped the modern concept of the atom.\"\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 28, 2002, \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" received a 7.4 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.8 million viewers. It finished in 26th place in the ratings for the week of April 22–28, 2002, making it the most watched program on the network that night. Combined with a new episode of \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"The Simpsons\" beat CBS's \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" special (\"Everybody Loves Raymond: The First Six Years\") in the ratings, besting the special by a full rating point and a half among adults between ages 18 to 49. On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray box set. Matt Groening, Al Jean, Matt Selman, Mike Reiss, Chuck Sheetz, Don Payne, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, David Silverman, and Stan Lee participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode.\n\nUpon the episode's release, a promotional image of Homer mimicking the Hulk caused some of the series' internet fans to speculate that the show had jumped the shark. \"[...] I still remember the publicity it [the episode] got,\" Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. \"The internet people were like, 'They jumped the shark. They're having Homer turn into The Hulk.' [...] We clearly did it in a logical fashion. He's not really super strong.\" \n\nFollowing its broadcast, \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" garnered positive reviews from critics, and is often considered a fan favorite. \n\nColin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode one of the better installments from Season 13, referring to it as \"very good\" and saying that \"the series has milked Homer's rage [as one of its chief sources of humor] for years, but it does so in creative and satisfying ways here.\" \n\nR.L. Shaffer of IGN described \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\", along with \"Brawl in the Family\" and \"Half-Decent Proposal\", as being \"cleverly written\" and the best episodes of the season. \n\nAaron Peck of High-Def Digest stated that the episode is one of his \"personal favorites,\" and Ron Martin of 411Mania called it a \"standout episode.\" \n\nAdam Rayner of Obsessed With Film gave the episode a favorable review as well. He wrote that, even though it is not \"as rooted in reality as the great episodes,\" the episode is \"consistently hilarious.\" He concluded that the episode is \"great comedy from start to finish.\"\n\nBlu-ray.com's Casey Broadwater called it a \"strong character-centric episode,\" and added that the episode's title is one of his \"favorites.\" \n\nWriting for Project-Blu, Nate Boss wrote \"Just when you think \"The Simpsons\" is broke, we get Angry Dad. To quote Stan Lee: 'Broke? Or made it BETTER?' That's right. Stan 'the man' Lee.\" \n\nJennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+, describing \"Homer's random exclamation while running around on fire, 'Oh, I hope no one's drawing this!'\" as the episode's \"highlight.\" \n\nRyan Keefer of DVD Talk described the episode as being \"flat out funny.\" Lee's appearance in the episode was also praised. Rayner called his performance \"one of the all time great cameos,\" and Jacobson called it \"fun.\" Broadwater considered Lee's appearance to be one of the season's \"highlights,\" and \"Total Film\"'s Nathan Ditum ranked Lee's performance as the 12th best guest appearance in the show's history, describing it as \"a deranged, childish and brilliant version of himself.\"\n\nThe episode has been used as an indicator to the growth of internet companies. In his article \"Best Indicator Ever: The Simpsons Foreclosure\", Jonathan Hoenig of \"SmartMoney\" wrote that the twentieth season episode \"No Loan Again, Naturally\", an episode in which the Simpsons are foreclosed from their house, could have indicated that \"the worst of the housing crisis\" at the time the article was written, was over. Hoenig based this theory on the fact that shortly after \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\", which satirizes the dot-com bubble, aired, the dotcom stocks \"began a massive rebound from bear-market lows.\"\n\n\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\" inspired the idea for the twenty-second season episode \"\", which originally aired on February 20, 2011 in the United States. In \"Angry Dad: The Movie\", Bart and Homer create a short film based on the \"Angry Dad\" cartoon seen in \"I Am Furious (Yellow)\", but after the film wins a myriad of prizes, the two start fighting over who created the series.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811564", "title": "Harry Hinsley", "text": "Harry Hinsley\n\nSir Francis Harry Hinsley OBE (26 November 1918 – 16 February 1998) was an English historian and cryptanalyst. He worked at Bletchley Park during the Second World War and wrote widely on the history of international relations and British Intelligence during the Second World War. He was known as Harry Hinsley.\n\nHinsley's father worked in the coal department of the Walsall Co-Op. His mother Emma Hinsley (née Adey) was a school caretaker, and they lived in Birchills, in the parish of St Andrew's, Walsall. Harry was educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and in 1937 won a scholarship to read history at St. John's College, Cambridge. He went on to be awarded a first in part one of the Historical Tripos.\n\nIn August 1939 Hinsley visited his girlfriend in the German city of Koblenz. Police required him to report to the police station daily. However, this requirement was waived following the signing of the German-Soviet Pact. A week later Hinsley was advised by police via his girlfriend's parents to get out of Germany by \"tomorrow at the latest\". This enabled him to cross the Franco-German border before it was closed. He made the crossing at the bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg. Stripped of his Reichsmarks by German border guards without French Francs or British Pounds in exchange, Hinsley was left penniless. This led to his sleeping on a park bench in France. Hinsley hitch-hiked to Switzerland from where he returned to the United Kingdom. He made his return just before Britain declared war on Germany. In October 1939, while still at St. John's, he was summoned to an interview with Alastair Denniston, head of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), and was thereby recruited to Bletchley Park's naval section in Hut 4. He abandoned his degree course and thereafter never completed it.\n\nAt Bletchley Park, Hinsley studied the external characteristics of intercepted German messages, a process sometimes termed \"traffic analysis\": from call signs, frequencies, times of interception and so forth, he was able to deduce a great deal of information about the structure of Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\"s communication networks, and even about the structure of the German navy itself.\n\nHinsley helped initiate a programme of seizing Enigma machines and keys from German weather ships, such as the \"Lauenburg\", thereby facilitating Bletchley Park's resumption of interrupted breaking of German Naval Enigma. He realised that, as the ships were on station for long periods, they would have to carry the code books (which changed every month) for subsequent months; these would likely be in a locked safe, and might be overlooked when the crew threw Enigma materials (including the code book currently in use) overboard if the ship was boarded, an assumption which proved correct.\n\nIn late 1943, Hinsley was sent to liaise with the US Navy in Washington, with the result that an agreement was reached in January 1944 to co-operate in exchanging results on Japanese Naval signals.\n\nTowards the end of the war, Hinsley, by then a key aide to Bletchley Park chief Edward Travis, was part of a committee which argued for a post-war intelligence agency that would combine both signals intelligence and human intelligence in a single organisation. In the event, the opposite occurred, with GC&CS becoming GCHQ.\nOn 6 April 1946, Hinsley married Hilary Brett-Smith, a graduate from Somerville College, Oxford, who had also worked at Bletchley Park, in Hut 8. They moved to Cambridge after the war where Hinsley had been elected a Fellow at St. John's College.\n\nHinsley was awarded the OBE in 1946, and was knighted in 1985.\n\nOn his death, Sir Harry Hinsley was cremated, and his family buried the ashes privately in Cambridge.\n\nAfter the war, Hinsley returned to St John's College and lectured in history; in 1969, he was appointed \"Professor of the History of International Relations\". From 1979 to 1989, he was Master of St John's College and, from 1981 to 1983, he was vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn 1962, Hinsley published \"Power and the Pursuit of Peace\", which is important as a study of early idealist thought about international relations.\n\nHinsley edited the multi-volume official history \"British Intelligence in the Second World War\" and argued that Enigma decryption had speeded Allied victory by one to four years but had not fundamentally altered the war's outcome.\n\nHe was criticised by Marian Rejewski and Gordon Welchman, who took exception to inaccuracies in Hinsley's accounts of the history of Enigma decryption in the early volumes of his official history, including crucial errors in chronology. Subsequently, a revised account of the Polish, French and British contribution was included in Volume 3, Part 2.\n\nThe following volumes of \"British Intelligence in the Second World War\" were edited by Hinsley and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) London:\n\nHinsley also co-edited (with Alan Stripp) and contributed to \"Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park\", which contains personal accounts from those who worked at Bletchley Park.\n\nThe Hinsley Memorial Lecture, an annual lecture on an international relations topic, is held every year at St John's College in memory of Hinsley.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811568", "title": "Wacker process", "text": "Wacker process\n\nThe Wacker process or the Hoechst-Wacker process (named after the chemical companies of the same name) refers to the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde in the presence of palladium(II) chloride as the catalyst. This chemical reaction was one of the first homogeneous catalysis with organopalladium chemistry applied on an industrial scale.\n\nThe Wacker reaction was first reported by Smidt et al.\n\nThe development of the chemical process now known as the Wacker process began in 1956 at Wacker Chemie. At the time, many industrial compounds were produced from acetylene, derived from calcium carbide, an expensive and environmentally unfriendly technology. The construction of a new oil refinery in Cologne by Esso close to a Wacker site, combined with the realization that ethylene would be a cheaper raw-material prompted Wacker to investigate its potential uses. As part of the ensuing research effort, a reaction of ethylene and oxygen over palladium on carbon in a quest for ethylene oxide unexpectedly gave evidence for the formation of acetaldehyde (simply based on smell). More research into this ethylene to acetaldehyde conversion resulted in a 1957 patent describing a gas-phase reaction using a heterogeneous catalyst. In the meanwhile Hoechst AG joined the race and after a patent filing forced Wacker into a partnership called Aldehyd GmbH. The heterogeneous process ultimately failed due to catalyst inactivation and was replaced by the water-based homogeneous system for which a pilot plant was operational in 1958. Problems with the aggressive catalyst solution were solved by adopting titanium (newly available for industrial use) as construction material for reactors and pumps. Production plants went into operation in 1960.\n\nThe reaction mechanism for the industrial Wacker process (olefin oxidation via palladium(II) chloride) has received significant attention for several decades. Aspects of the mechanism are still debated. A modern formulation is described below:\nThe initial stoichiometric reaction was first reported by Phillips. The net reaction can also be described as follows:\n\nThis conversion is followed by reactions that regenerate the Pd(II) catalyst:\n\nOnly the alkene and oxygen are consumed. Without copper(II) chloride as an oxidizing agent, Pd(0) metal (resulting from beta-hydride elimination of Pd(II) in the final step) would precipitate, stopping the reaction after one cycle. This stoichiometric reaction was discovered in 1894. Air, pure oxygen, or a number of other reagents can then oxidise the resultant CuCl-chloride mixture back to CuCl, allowing the cycle to continue.\n\nEarly mechanistic studies from the 1960s elucidated several key points:\n\n\nMany mechanistic studies on the Wacker process have focused on pathway for formation of the C-O bond, the hydroxypalladation step. Henry inferred that coordinated hydroxide attacks the ethylene ligand, an internal (syn-) pathway. Later, stereochemical studies by Stille and coworkers support an anti-addition pathway, whereby free hydroxide attacks the ethylene ligand. The conditions for Stille's experiments differ significantly from industrial process conditions. Other studies using normal industrial Wacker conditions (except with high chloride and high copper chloride concentrations) also yielded products that inferred nucleophilic attack was an anti-addition reaction.\n\nKinetic studies were conducted on isotopically substituted allyl alcohols at standard industrial conditions (with low-chloride concentrations) to probe the reaction mechanisms. Those results showed that nucleophilic attack is a slow process, while the proposed mechanisms explaining the earlier stereochemical studies assumed nucleophilic attack to be a fast process.\n\nSubsequent stereochemical studies indicated that both pathways occur and are dependent on chloride concentrations. However, these studies too are disputed since allyl-alcohols may be sensitive to isomerization reactions, and different stereoisomers may be formed from those reactions and not from the standard Wacker process.\n\nIn summary, experimental evidence seems to support that syn-addition occurs under low-chloride reaction concentrations (< 1 mol/L, industrial process conditions), while anti-addition occurs under high-chloride (> 3mol/L) reaction concentrations, probably due to chloride ions saturating the catalyst and inhibiting the inner-sphere mechanism. However, the exact pathway and the reason for this switching of pathways is still unknown.\n\nFurther complicating the Wacker process mechanism is questions about the role of copper chloride. Most theories assumed copper does not play a role in the olefin oxidation mechanisms. Yet, experiments by Stangl and Jira found chlorohydrin formation was dependent on copper chloride concentrations. Work by Hosokawa and coworkers yielded a crystallized product containing copper chloride, indicating it may have a non-innocent role in olefin oxidation. Finally, an ab initio study by Comas-Vives, \"et al.\" involving no copper co-catalyst found anti-addition was the preferred pathway. This pathway was later confirmed by copper-free experiments by Anderson and Sigman. A different kinetic rate law with no proton dependence was found under copper-free conditions, indicating the possibility that even small amounts of copper co-catalysts may have non-innocent roles on this chemistry. While these works complicate the picture of the Wacker process mechanism, one should probably infer that this and related chemistry can be sensitive to reaction conditions, and multiple different reaction pathways may be in play.\n\nAnother key step in the Wacker process is the migration of the hydrogen from oxygen to chloride and formation of the C-O double bond. This step is generally thought to proceed through a so-called β-hydride elimination with a cyclic four-membered transition state:\n\nIn silico studies argue that the transition state for this reaction step is unfavorable and an alternative reductive elimination reaction mechanism is in play. The proposed reaction steps are likely assisted by water molecule in solution acting as a catalyst.\n\nTwo routes are commercialized for the production of acetaldehyde: one-stage process and two-stage.\n\nEthylene and oxygen are passed co-currently in a reaction tower at about 130 °C and 400 kPa. The catalyst is an aqueous solution of PdCl and CuCl. The acetaldehyde is purified by extractive distillation followed by fractional distillation. Extractive distillation with water removes the lights ends having lower boiling points than acetaldehyde (chloromethane, chloroethane, and carbon dioxide) at the top, while water and higher-boiling byproducts, such as acetic acid, crotonaldehyde or chlorinated acetaldehydes, are withdrawn together with acetaldehyde at the bottom.\nDue to the corrosive nature of catalyst, the reactor is lined with acid-proof ceramic material and the tubing is made of titanium.\n\nIn two-stage process, reaction and oxidation are carried out separately in tubular reactors. Unlike one-stage process, air can be used instead of oxygen. Ethylene is passed through the reactor along with catalyst at 105–110 °C and 900–1000 kPa. Catalyst solution containing acetaldehyde is separated by flash distillation. The catalyst is oxidized in the oxidation reactor at 1000 kPa using air as oxidizing medium. Oxidized catalyst solution is separated and sent back to reactor. Oxygen from air is used up completely and the exhaust air is circulated as inert gas. Acetaldehyde – water vapor mixture is preconcentrated to 60–90% acetaldehyde by utilizing the heat of reaction and the discharged water is returned to the flash tower to maintain catalyst concentration. A two-stage distillation of the crude acetaldehyde follows. In the first stage, low-boiling substances, such as chloromethane, chloroethane and carbon dioxide, are separated. In the second stage, water and higher-boiling by-products, such as chlorinated acetaldehydes and acetic acid, are removed and acetaldehyde is obtained in pure form overhead.\nDue to corrosive nature of the catalyst, the equipments in contact with it are lined with titanium.\n\nIn both one- and two-stage processes the acetaldehyde yield is about 95% and the production costs are virtually the same. The advantage of using dilute gases in the two-stage method is balanced by higher investment costs. Both methods yield chlorinated hydrocarbons, chlorinated acetaldehydes, and acetic acid as byproducts. Generally, the choice of method is governed by the raw material and energy situations as well as by the availability of oxygen at a reasonable price.\nIn general, 100 parts of ethylene gives:\nand other minor side products\n\nThe advent of Wacker Process has spurred on many investigations into the utility and applicability of the reactions to more complex terminal olefins. The Tsuji-Wacker Oxidation is the palladium(II)-catalyzed transformation of such olefins into carbonyl compounds. Clement and Selwitz were the first to find that using an aqueous DMF as solvent allowed for the oxidation of 1-dodecene to 2-dodecanone, which addressed the insolubility problem of higher order olefins in water. Fahey noted the use of 3-methylsulfolane in place of DMF as solvent increased the yield of oxidation of 3,3-Dimethylbut-1-ene. Two years after, Tsuji applied the Selwitz conditions for selective oxidations of terminal olefins with multiple functional groups, and demonstrated its utility in synthesis of complex substrates. Further development of the reaction has led to various catalytic systems to address selectivity of the reaction, as well as introduction of intermolecular and intramolecular oxidations with non-water nucleophiles.\n\nThe Tsuji-Wacker Oxidation oxidizes terminal olefin to the corresponding methyl ketone under the Wacker process condition. Almost identical to that of Wacker Process, the proposed catalytic cycle(Figure 1) begins with complexation of PdCl and two chloride anions to PdCl, which then undergoes subsequent ligand exchange of two chloride ligand for water and alkene to form Pd(Cl)(HO)(alkene) complex. A water molecule then attacks the olefin regioselectively through an outer sphere mechanism in a Markovnikov fashion, to form the more thermodynamically stable Pd(Cl)(OH)(-CH-CHOH-R) complex. Dissociation of a chloride ligand to the three coordinate palladium complex promotes β-hydride elimination, then subsequent 1,2-hydride insertion generates Pd(Cl)(OH)(-CHOHR-CH) complex. This undergoes β-hydride elimination to release the ketone, and subsequent reductive elimination produces HCl, water, and palladium(0). Finally palladium(0) is reoxidized to PdCl with two equivalents of Cu(II)Cl, which in turn can be reoxidized by O.\n\nThe oxidation of terminal olefins generally provide the Markovnikov ketone product, however in cases where substrate favors the aldehyde (discussed below), different ligands can be used to enforce the Markovnikov regioselectivity. The use of sparteine as a ligand (Figure 2, A) favors nucleopalladation at the terminal carbon to minimize steric interaction between the palladium complex and substrate. The Quinox-ligated palladium catalyst is used to favor ketone formation when substrate contains a directing group (Figure 2, B). When such substrate bind to Pd(Quinox)(OOtBu), this complex is coordinately saturated which prevents the binding of the directing group, and results in formation of the Markovnikov product. The efficiency of this ligand is also attributed to its electronic property, where anionic TBHP prefers to bind \"trans\" to the oxazoline and olefin coordinate \"trans\" to the quinoline.\nThe anti-Markovnikov selectivity to aldehyde can be achieved through exploiting inherent stereoelectronics of the substrate. Placement of directing group at homo-allylic (i.e. Figure 3, A) and allylic position (i.e. Figure 3, B) to the terminal olefin favors the anti-Markovnikov aldehyde product, which suggests that in the catalytic cycle the directing group chelates to the palladium complex such that water attacks at the anti-Markovnikov carbon to generate the more thermodynamically stable palladocycle. Anti-Markovnikov selectivity is also observed in styrenyl substrates (i.e. Figure 3, C), presumably via η-palladium-styrene complex after water attacks anti-Markovnikov. More examples of substrate-controlled, anti-Markovnikov Tsuji-Wacker Oxidation of olefins are given in reviews by Namboothiri, Feringa, and Muzart.\n\nGrubbs and co-workers paved way for anti-Markovnikov oxidation of stereoelectronically unbiased terminal olefins, through the use of palladium-nitrite system (Figure 2, D). In his system, the terminal olefin was oxidized to the aldehyde with high selectivity through a catalyst-control pathway. The mechanism is under investigation, however evidence suggests it goes through a nitrite radical adds into the terminal carbon to generate the more thermodynamically stable, secondary radical. Grubbs expanded this methodology to more complex, unbiased olefins.\n\nThe intermolecular oxidations of olefins with alcohols as nucleophile typically generate ketals, where as the palladium-catalyzed oxidations of olefins with carboxylic acids as nucleophile genreats vinylic or allylic carboxylates. In case of diols, their reactions with alkenes typically generate ketals, whereas reactions of olefins bearing electron-withdrawing groups tend to form acetals.\n\nPalladium-catalyzed intermolecular oxidations of dienes with carboxylic acids and alcohols as donors give 1,4-addition products. In the case of cyclohexadiene (Figure 4, A), Backvall found that stereochemical outcome of product was found to depend on concentration of LiCl. This reaction proceeds by first generating the Pd(OAc)(benzoquinone)(allyl) complex, through anti-nucleopalladation of diene with acetate as nucleophile. The absence of LiCl induces an inner sphere reductive elimination to afford the trans-acetate stereochemistry to give the trans-1,4-adduct. The presence of LiCl displaces acetate with chloride due to its higher binding affinity, which forces an outer sphere acetate attack anti to the palladium, and affords the cis-acetate stereochemistry to give the cis-1,4-adduct. Intramolecular oxidative cyclization: 2-(2-cyclohexenyl)phenol cyclizes to corresponding dihydro-benzofuran (Figure 4, B); 1-cyclohexadiene-acetic acid in presence of acetic acid cyclizes to corresponding lactone-acetate 1,4 adduct (Figure 4, C), with cis and trans selectivity controlled by LiCl presence.\nThe oxidative aminations of olefins are generally conducted with amides or imides; amines are thought to be protonated by the acidic medium or to bind the metal center too tightly to allow for the catalytic chemistry to occur. These nitrogen nucleophiles are found to be competent in both intermolecular and intramolecular reactions, some examples are depicted (Figure 5, A, B)\n"}

It is most noted for its equestrian staircase, a 7.5-turn helical corridor leading to the platform at the top at 34.8 meters above ground, and for the expansive views which it affords over Copenhagen. \n\nThe tower is part of the \"Trinitatis Complex\" which also provided the scholars of the time with a university chapel, the Trinitatis Church, and an academic library which were the first facilities of the Copenhagen University Library which had been founded in 1482. Today, the Round Tower serves as an observation tower for views of Copenhagen, a public astronomical observatory, and a historical monument. The Library Hall above the church is only accessible along the tower's ramp and is a venue for exhibitions and concerts.\n\nAstronomy had grown in importance in 17th-century Europe. Countries had begun competing with each other in establishing colonies, creating a need for accurate navigation across the oceans. Many national observatories were therefore established, the first in 1632 at Leiden in the Dutch Republic. Only five years later the Round Tower Observatory, first referred to as STELLÆBURGI REGII HAUNIENSIS, would follow.\n\nAfter Tycho Brahe had fallen out of favour and left Denmark, Christian Longomontanus had become Christian IV's new astronomer and the first professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen. In 1625 he suggested the king build an astronomical tower as a replacement for Brahe's Stjerneborg which had been demolished Steenwinckel|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref>\n\nLongomontanus' initial proposal was to erect the new observatory on the top of the hill Solbjerget, now known as Valby Bakke. But since there were also plans for the construction of a new students' church and a library for the university, the idea of merging the three buildings into one grand complex emerged.\n\nAlready in 1622, Christian IV had bought the land where it was ultimately decided to build the Trinitatis Complex. His original plans for the site are not known but as it was conveniently located next to the Regensen dormitories and the university, it was chosen for his new prestigious project.\n\nAlthough there is no clear proof, it is generally accepted that Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger was charged with the commission to design the new edifice though he did not live to see the tower completed. \nFrom 24 November 1636, stones were brought to the site for the foundation, first from the city's ramparts and later from the area around Roskilde. Bricks were ordered from the Netherlands since local manufacturers could not meet the high quality standards requested. In February 1637, a contract was signed with a Henrik van Dingklage in Emden for the supply of bricks for the construction. The first three ship loads were to be delivered in May, the next three loads the following month and the remainder on demand.\n\nThe Trinitatis Complex was set for construction in a crowded neighbourhood of narrow streets and alleyways. The area first had to be cleared. On 18 April 1637, 200 men, soldiers and personnel from Bremerholm began to demolish the half-timbered houses occupying the site.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on 7 July 1637. When Hans van Steenwinckel died on 6 August 1639, Leonhard Blasius was brought to Denmark from the Netherlands as new Royal Building Master. Unlike his predecessor, he would become a mere transitional figure in Danish architecture, dying just four years after his arrival in the country without leaving any notable buildings of his own design. On several occasions construction work came to a standstill due to shortage of funds. Churches in Denmark and Norway were therefore ordered to contribute a share of their earnings during the construction years. In 1642, the tower was finally completed, though the church was completed only in 1657 and the library in 1657.\n\nChristian Longomontanus became the first director of the observatory. In the Great Fire of 1728 the Trinitatis Complex was severely damaged but was rebuilt.\n\n in connection with his proposal to move the tower to a position next to the church]] \nDuring the early 19th century, the Round Tower became outdated as an astronomical observatory. Instruments were growing still larger while the tower could not be expanded and, at the same time, light pollution from the surrounding city and vibrations caused by the ever increasing traffic in the streets below had made the observations inaccurate. The University therefore decided to build Østervold Observatory on the old bastioned fortifications of the city, which had become outdated and were being decommissioned. The new observatory was inaugurated in 1861 to the design of Christian Hansen.\n\n\nThe Round Tower is a cylindrical tower built in masonry of alternating yellow and red bricks, the colours of the Oldenburgs. The bricks used were manufactured in the Netherlands and are of a hard-burned, slender type known as \"muffer\" or \"mopper\". On the rear side, it is attached to the Trinitatis Church, but it has never served as a church tower.\n\nSteenwinckel — whose name is otherwise synonymous with Dutch Renaissance architecture in Denmark — with the Trinitatis Complex has left his signature style. Unlike his other buildings with their lavish ornamentations and extravagant spires, the complex is built to a focused and restrained design. Hans van Steenwinckel must have been up on the situation in Holland, cogniziant that the style which he had once learned from Hendrick de Keyser had been altogether abandoned.\n\nThe architects now setting the agenda in the Netherlands, masters such as Jacob van Kampen (Amsterdam City Hall), Pieter Post (Mauritshuis in the Hague) and Philip Vingboons, now favoured a style characterized by sobriety and restraint. It is now known as Dutch Baroque or sometimes Dutch Classicism. Its proponents often relied on the theoretical works such as those of Andrea Palladio and of Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola. Steenwinckel may have paid a visit to his native Netherlands prior to his change in style but it will have been too early for him to have seen any of the period's buildings realized.\n\nInstead of stairs, a 7.5-turn spiral ramp forms the only access way to the towertop observatory as well as the Library Hall and the Bell-Ringer's Loft, both located above the church. The ramp turns 7.5 times around the hollow masonry core of the tower before reaching the observation deck and observatory at the top, on the way also affording access to the Library Hall as well as the Ringer's Loft. This design was chosen to allow a horse and carriage to reach the library, moving books in and out of the library as well as transporting heavy and sensitive instruments to the observatory.\n\nThe winding corridor has a length of 210 m, climbing 3.74 m per turn. Along the outer wall the corridor has a length of 257.5 m and a grade of 10%, while along the wall of the inner core the corridor is only 85.5 m long but has a grade of 33%.\n\nThe observation deck is located 34.8 m above street level. Along the edge of the platform runs a wrought-iron lattice made in 1643 by Kaspar Fincke, Court Artist in metalwork. In the latticework, Christian IV's monogram and the letters RFP are seen, the letters representing the King's motto: \"Regna Firmat Pietas\" – Piety strengthens the Realms.\n\nThe observatory is a small domed building, built on the roof of the tower. Built in 1929, the current observatory is 7 m high and has a diameter of 6 m. Access is by a narrow winding stone staircase from the observation deck.\n\nOn the upper part of the façade of the tower, there is a gilded rebus inscription. Christian IV's draft of it, written in his own hand writing, is kept at the Danish National Archives. The rebus includes the four Hebrew consonants of the Tetragrammaton. The rebus can be interpreted in the following way: \"Lead God, the right teaching and justice into the heart of the crowned King Christian IV, 1642\".\n\nThe tower contains a toilet used by the researchers and astronomers working in the tower and consisting of a seat almost at the top and a shaft leading down to the bottom floor built into the hollow core. This shaft has no way of emptying it nor any ventilation to the outside, making it arguably one of the world's largest and earliest septic tanks.\n\nToday the Round Tower serves as an observation tower, a public astronomical observatory, an exhibition and concert venue and a historical monument.\n\nIn 1860 the University of Copenhagen decommissioned the Round Tower as a university observatory but in 1928 it was reconstructed as an observatory with access for amateur astronomers and the general public. It is open from mid-October to mid-March.\nSince 1987, the Library Hall which lies above The Trinitatis Church, has served as an exhibition space, featuring various exhibitions of art, culture, history and science. At the same time, it is used as a concert venue, every year hosting around a hundred concerts.\n\nThe observation deck affords extensive views over the rooftops of the old part of Copenhagen with its many spires, including the Marble Church, the Nikolaj contemporary art center, Christiansborg Palace, , the Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen City Hall, Palace Hotel, the Church of Our Lady, St. Peter's Church, the Great Synagogue, St. Andrew's Church, Rosenborg Castle, the Church of Our Saviour and the pipes of . On clear days, both the Øresund Bridge and Sweden can be seen in the distance.\n\nEvery year in spring, a unicycle race is held in the Round Tower. The contestants have to go up and down the tower. The world record, set in 1988, is 1 minute and 48.7 seconds.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1991 to 2001, where he was a five-time World Tag Team Champion.\n\nMissy Hyatt helped Bagwell break into the wrestling business. Growing up, Bagwell was a standout baseball player during his tenure in Sprayberry High School, and worked for his family's lumber company. Upon graduating from high school, he started an amateur boxing career. When the lumber company went bankrupt, however, Bagwell became a certified massage therapist before deciding to become a wrestler.\n\nHe trained under Steve Lawler and debuted in 1990, working for North Georgia Wrestling as Fabulous Fabian. In 1991, he began wrestling with the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) as The Handsome Stranger, a gimmick suggested by Bill Eadie that saw Bagwell don a Lone Ranger-style mask, and hand out roses to the female fans.\n\nIn 1991, Bagwell was hired by World Championship Wrestling, where he wrestled under his full name. Bagwell made his WCW debut on November 5 in a non-televised match, losing to Mike Graham. He would then wrestle a tryout match on November 11 and made his televised debut as a fan favorite at \"Clash of the Champions XVII\", where he was interviewed by Missy Hyatt. He made his televised in-ring debut by defeating Rip Rogers on the December 14 episode of \"World Championship Wrestling\". Bagwell made his pay-per-view debut at Starrcade, where he was paired with Jimmy Garvin against Michael Hayes and Tracy Smothers in a Lethal Lottery match, which Bagwell and Garvin won to qualify for the Battlebowl battle royal later in the night, which Sting won. Bagwell received his first title shot on the January 11, 1992 episode of \"World Championship Wrestling\" against Steve Austin for the World Television Championship, but failed to win the title as the match ended in a ten-minute time limit draw. Bagwell would then begin feuding with Terrance Taylor, which led to a match between the two at SuperBrawl II, which Bagwell won.\n\nBagwell formed a tag team with Tom Zenk on the February 15 episode of \"World Championship Wrestling\", to feud with Taylor and his partner Greg Valentine over the United States Tag Team Championship and received several title shots but failed to win the titles. Bagwell would then lose a match to Scotty Flamingo at WrestleWar. The duo would participate in a tournament for the newly created NWA World Tag Team Championship, where they would lose to Rick Rude and Steve Austin in the first round at \"Clash of the Champions XIX\". Bagwell would then face Greg Valentine in a losing effort at Beach Blast. Bagwell and Zenk would fail in several title shots and after limited success as a team, they split up quietly and focused on their singles careers. He would then form a short-lived tag team with Brad Armstrong for the remainder of the year until the two split up in early 1993.\n\nBagwell participated in a tournament for the vacant World Television Championship on the February 20, 1993 episode of \"Worldwide\", where he lost to Maxx Payne in the first round. On the February 20 episode of \"Saturday Night\", Bagwell teamed with 2 Cold Scorpio and Steve Regal to defeat Scotty Flamingo, Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce in a six-man tag team match. This would lead to the formation of a tag team of Bagwell and Scorpio. During this time, Bagwell began a feud with The Hollywood Blonds (Brian Pillman and Steve Austin), which led to Bagwell teaming with Erik Watts to take on Hollywood Blonds in a tag team match at SuperBrawl III, which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell resumed teaming with Scorpio and the team gained success unlike Bagwell's previous teams as they defeated various teams including Bobby Eaton and Chris Benoit at Slamboree, Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce at Beach Blast and The Equalizer and Paul Orndorff at Fall Brawl. As a result of their success in the tag team division, they quickly became contenders for the World Tag Team Championship. On the October 23 episode of \"Saturday Night\", Bagwell and Scorpio defeated The Nasty Boys to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's first title win in WCW. They lost the titles back to Nasty Boys at Halloween Havoc.\n\nBagwell would be paired with Tex Slazenger against Rick Rude and Shanghai Pierce in a Battlebowl qualifying match at Battlebowl pay-per-view on November 20, which Bagwell's team lost. Bagwell and Scorpio would then begin feuding with the newly formed team Pretty Wonderful, which led to a match at Starrcade, which Pretty Wonderful won. However, Bagwell and Scorpio defeated Pretty Wonderful in a rematch at \"Clash of the Champions XXVI\" to earn a title shot for the World Tag Team Championship against Nasty Boys on the January 29, 1994 episode of \"Saturday Night\", but failed in regaining the titles. Bagwell received his first world championship title shot on the final episode of \"Power Hour\" on March 5 against Rick Rude for the International World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost. Shortly after, Scorpio was released by WCW, thus dissolving Bagwell and Scorpio's tag team.\n\nOn the May 28 episode of \"Worldwide\", Bagwell formed a new tag team with The Patriot called Stars and Stripes as they defeated Dick Slater and Chris Sullivan in their first match as a team. They were quickly put in contention for the World Tag Team Championship and entered a feud with the champions Pretty Wonderful over the titles. After losing to Pretty Wonderful in a title shot at Fall Brawl, Stars and Stripes defeated them in a rematch on the September 25 episode of \"Main Event\" to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus marking Bagwell's second reign with the title. They lost the titles back to Pretty Wonderful at Halloween Havoc but won the titles a second time at \"Clash of the Champions XXIX\". They lost the titles to Harlem Heat on December 8, which aired on the January 14, 1995 episode of \"Saturday Night\". Stars and Stripes failed in regaining the titles from Harlem Heat in rematches at \"Clash of the Champions XXX\", the February 11 episode of \"Saturday Night\" and the March 5 episode of \"Worldwide\".\n\nBagwell would enter a tournament for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship, losing to Meng in the opening round on the April 29 episode of \"Saturday Night\". Patriot left WCW in May and Bagwell resumed to singles competition while making makeshift tag teams with Jim Duggan, Johnny B. Badd and Alex Wright to regain the World Tag Team Championship but could not regain the titles.\n\nOn the September 16 episode of \"Saturday Night\", Bagwell formed a tag team with Scotty Riggs called The American Males as they defeated State Patrol in their debut match. The newly formed team defeated Harlem Heat to win the World Tag Team Championship on the September 18 episode of \"Monday Nitro\". They lost the titles back to Harlem Heat on the October 28 episode of \"Saturday Night\". Bagwell participated in the first-ever World War 3 battle royal at the namesake event for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Randy Savage. American Males received a rematch for the tag team titles against Harlem Heat on the December 4 episode of \"Nitro\", which they failed to win. The team would find no success afterwards and would lose most of their matches throughout 1996. During this time, Bagwell made only two pay-per-view appearances; the first at The Great American Bash, where he lost to Diamond Dallas Page and the second at World War 3, where he participated in the namesake match with the winner earning a title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship but failed to win the match.\n\nOn November 25, 1996, Bagwell joined the New World Order (nWo) after turning on his partner Scotty Riggs. He soon renamed himself to Buff Bagwell and formed a tag team with Scott Norton called Vicious and Delicious. To go along with his name change he developed the habits of flexing his muscles and would talk to the camera insulting his opponents while complementing himself. While with the nWo, he also competed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as a part of nWo Japan, the NJPW version of the nWo. When he returned to America, he began a feud with Lex Luger, which later saw Bagwell defeat him at Starrcade.\n\nOn the April 22, 1998 edition of \"Thunder\", Bagwell wrestled a match tag team match with Scott Norton (representing the nWo) against Rick Steiner and Lex Luger which they won when Scott Steiner interfered on his behalf. Just before that, however, Rick attempted his diving bulldog finishing move, which was not executed correctly and resulted in Bagwell's head striking Steiner's back, jamming his neck and severely injuring him. Bagwell was diagnosed with several damaged vertebrae and developed spinal shock, leading him to use a wheelchair and neck brace for some time. He returned months later for an interview only to be viciously ridiculed by Hollywood Hogan and shoved to the entryway floor. On July 6, after recently having neck surgery, the wheelchair-ridden Bagwell returned to WCW in his home state of Georgia. Bagwell seemed to have a new attitude and even called out Rick Steiner to offer him his forgiveness. However, Bagwell restrained Rick while fellow nWo member Scott Steiner assaulted him with a steel chair, reaffirming his loyalty to Hogan and the nWo. Bagwell then rose from his wheelchair and helped Scott beat down Rick. In January 1999, the nWo factions reunited, leading Bagwell and Steiner to side with the nWo Wolfpac. Their alliance ended at Uncensored when Bagwell accidentally hit Steiner with a chair, costing him the World Television Championship.\n\nIn June 1999, Bagwell engaged in a rivalry with WCW President Ric Flair and Vice President Roddy Piper after claiming he was being held back. This led to a three-round boxing match with Piper at the Bash at the Beach, which saw Bagwell victorious. In September 1999, he feuded with Berlyn when Berlyn issued a challenge to Bagwell, but at Fall Brawl, Bagwell was late coming to the arena and \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan replaced him. The next night on \"Nitro\", Bagwell lost to Berlyn after the interference of his bodyguard, The Wall. In November, he defeated veteran Curt Hennig in a retirement match. Bagwell then feuded with Diamond Dallas Page after he made allegations about Page's wife Kimberly. Having spent much of 1999 feuding with older wrestlers, Bagwell was one of the first to join Eric Bischoff's New Blood alliance, forming a tag team with Shane Douglas while both were members. Bagwell and Douglas eventually won the World Tag Team Championship from Ric Flair and Lex Luger, giving Bagwell his fifth World Tag Team Title reign and rekindling his feud with Luger from two years earlier. At Slamboree, Luger defeated Bagwell via submission with the \"Torture Rack\".\nOn May 9, 2000 following a \"Thunder\" taping in Springfield, Illinois, Bagwell punched and yelled racial slurs at WCW crew member Darrell Miller after he and Bagwell began arguing when Miller attempted to carry equipment through a doorway in which Bagwell was standing. Six days later, Bagwell was charged with battery by the Sangamon County, Illinois State's Attorney's office. In response, WCW suspended Bagwell for thirty days and stripped him of his half of the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nUpon his return, Bagwell attempted to win the World Tag Team Title with Douglas once more, but was unsuccessful. Bagwell, now with Torrie Wilson by his side, wrestled Douglas at Bash at the Beach, but lost when Wilson distracted him and sided with Douglas. Bagwell then began a feud with Chris Kanyon, who began stalking him and harassing Bagwell's mother Judy as a psychological tactic. Bagwell eventually defeated Kanyon in a match where Judy was suspended from a forklift. He rescued his mother despite the surprise interference of actor David Arquette. In August 2000, David Flair's storyline girlfriend Miss Hancock mysteriously became pregnant. Flair quickly accused the womanizing Bagwell, which led to a First Blood match at Halloween Havoc, with Flair hoping to obtain a sample of Bagwell's blood to prove he was the father of Hancock's child. Although Bagwell was victorious, Flair managed to get his blood sample when Bagwell's nemesis Lex Luger attacked him after the match. Bagwell was then revealed as not being the father, and the entire pregnancy was eventually found to have been a fabrication.\n\nAt Starrcade, Bagwell, who at the time had returned as a backstage interviewer, betrayed Goldberg by trying to cost him his match with Lex Luger. Bagwell's efforts were unsuccessful, but he managed to hit Goldberg with a steel chair after he had pinned Luger. Despite feuding in the past, Bagwell and Luger united and became known as Totally Buffed. Totally Buffed would go on to defeat Goldberg at Sin after a fan maced Goldberg, allowing Bagwell to pin him. Due to a stipulation in the match, Goldberg was, in storyline, fired. In early 2001, Totally Buffed joined Ric Flair's Magnificent Seven stable, and remained with them until WCW's closure.\n\nShortly after WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 2001, Bagwell was one of the first AOL Time Warner contracted wrestlers to accept the offered buy-out on his contract and sign with the WWF. On July 1, 2001, Bagwell faced Booker T at a house show and he made his WWF televised debut on the July 2 episode of \"Raw is War\", facing Booker T for the WCW Championship. The match went to a no-contest after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called the bout \"the worst match ever\". When Bagwell arrived to the \"Raw\" tapings on July 9 in Atlanta, Georgia, he was informed he was being released from his contract due to complaints about his attitude and an altercation with fellow WCW alumnus Shane Helms. There were also accusations that Bagwell faked an injury at the July 3 \"SmackDown!\" tapings after receiving an aided powerbomb from the Acolytes Protection Agency. The accusations also claimed his mother Judy was calling WWF offices to request that her son get time off to heal from an injury supposedly inflicted to Bagwell from the aided powerbomb and to complain about her son's travel arrangements. However, Bagwell himself claims that he never understood why he was fired from the WWF.\n\nAfter making several appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2002 and 2003, Bagwell returned to TNA on the April 27, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\" as the first of Sting's possible tag team partners for Sacrifice on May 14. Bagwell also appeared on the September 28 episode of \"Impact!\" in several segments, including a press conference, a video package, and a live segment where he briefly brawled with Jeff Jarrett. Bagwell also competed in two live events in TNA on December 15, 2006, Bagwell and Ron Killings defeated David Young and Elix Skipper and the next night Bagwell and Rhino defeated David Young and Elix Skipper. At a 2008 live event in Florida, Bagwell expressed that he would have liked to work a deal with TNA because it reminded him of his days in WCW.\n\nFollowing his departure from the WWF, Bagwell began performing for Jimmy Hart's newly founded X Wrestling Federation, which taped television matches at Universal Studios Florida on November 12 and 13, 2001. In addition to the XWF, Bagwell toured Europe and Australia with the World Wrestling All-Stars. In the autumn of 2001, he competed in the Inception pay-per-view where he won an open battle royal before losing to Jeff Jarrett in the semi-finals of the WWA World Heavyweight Championship tournament. A United Kingdom tour followed, where he mostly faced Stevie Ray and defeated him in several matches. He continued with the WWA into 2002, where in April, he took part in the Eruption pay-per-view. This time, he teamed up with his WWA rival Stevie Ray in an unsuccessful effort against Brian Christopher and Ernest Miller. In the autumn of 2002, he toured the UK and took part in the Retribution pay-per-view. During this tour, he often took part in the main event as a tag team match also involving Sting, Lex Luger and Nathan Jones. At the pay-per-view, he teamed up with Johnny Swinger to face Norman Smiley and Malice in a losing effort.\n\nSince his final appearance in TNA, Bagwell has resumed wrestling on the independent circuit, most prominently for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territory Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and Universal Championship Wrestling.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Bagwell resumed his wrestling career and, in early March 2013, he won American Premier Wrestling's Heavyweight Championship after defeating \"Cowboy\" Jeremy Young at APW's Brawl VI event.\n\nOn May 24, 2014, Bagwell competed in the JT Lightning Invitational Tournament held by Absolute Intense Wrestling, where he won his first round match against Jock Samson before losing to Ethan Page in the quarterfinals.\n\nBuff wrestled Jerry Lawler in Memphis on October 19, 2017 in a free show featuring several former WWE & WCW stars.\n\nBuff traveled to Christchurch, New Zealand in November 2017 to wrestle for Ultimate Championship Wrestling's (UCW) show Sole Survivor in a tag team match. He teamed with Haydn Daniels defeating the Southern Wrecking Crew.\n\nIn September 2018, under the management of Colton Menzel and Zach Salaam, Bagwell competed unsuccessfully in a UCW Heavyweight Title match against former WWE star Rob Conway at UCW's \"A Tribute fit for a King\" event. This was the first time Bagwell and Conway had ever faced each other.\n\nOn October 19, 2018, the nWo (Buff Bagwell, Scott Norton and X-Pac) competed against the No New Friends at the Glory Pro Wrestling #Unsanctioned event.\n\nBagwell frequently wrestles for the independent wrestling promotion, Universal Championship Wrestling, in his home state of Georgia.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Bagwell was seriously injured in a car accident. According to the Woodstock police report, Bagwell called his wife at 1:35 pm to tell her that he was about to suffer a seizure while driving. He was subsequently taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia, where he was placed in the hospital's intensive care unit after suffering broken bones in his neck, face and jaw. On April 24, fellow WCW alumnus and former tag team partner Scott Norton released a statement via Twitter to confirm that Bagwell was going to be all right. On April 25, Universal Championship Wrestling performer and Bagwell's brother John released a statement to confirm that Bagwell's condition was improving, but that he still required breathing and feeding tubes and would undergo surgery once the swelling in his face and neck subsided. On April 28, Bagwell's mother Judy revealed to TMZ that he had been taken off the breathing tube, was able to eat solid foods, and was able to talk. Fellow WCW alumni Sting, the Steiner Brothers, and Diamond Dallas Page have also kept in contact with Bagwell since his crash. On May 3, Universal Championship Wrestling announced via Twitter that Bagwell was able to walk again, but still had a tingling sensation in his arms and hands. UCW also stated that he had four plates surgically inserted in his face and that his jaw was wired shut after surgery.\n\nOn August 9, 2016 Bagwell filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court of Connecticut against the WWE for royalties from material he is featured in on the WWE Network. The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811597", "title": "Sons of the American Revolution", "text": "Sons of the American Revolution\n\nThe National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR or NSSAR) is an American congressionally chartered organization, founded in 1889 and headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. A non-profit corporation, it has described its purpose as maintaining and extending \"the institutions of American freedom, an appreciation for true patriotism, a respect for our national symbols, the value of American citizenship, [and] the unifying force of 'e pluribus unum' that has created, from the people of many nations, one nation and one people.\"\n\nThe members of the society are male descendants of people who served in the American Revolutionary War or who contributed to establishing the independence of the United States. It is dedicated to perpetuating American ideals and traditions, and to protecting the Constitution of the United States; the official recognition of Constitution Day, Flag Day, and Bill of Rights Day were established through its efforts. It has members in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe organization is distinct from the Sons of the Revolution, a separate descendants heritage organization founded on February 22, 1876 by businessman John Austin Stevens and members of The Society of the Cincinnati. SAR Founder William Osborn McDowell disagreed with the Sons of the Revolution requirement at that time that all state societies were to be subordinate to the New York society.\n\nThe first organization of descendants of Revolutionary War patriots was established in San Francisco, California, in 1876. A group of men who were descendants of Revolutionary War veterans gathered to celebrate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence and the founding of the United States. They also wanted to honor the men and women who pledged their lives, fortunes, and livelihood to the striving for independence from Great Britain. This group formed an organization called the Sons of Revolutionary War Sires (SRWS). There is, however, no direct link between the SRWS and the SAR except that members of the SRWS were permitted to join the SAR after its founding in 1889.\n\nThe history of the SAR can be traced to the founding of the Sons of the Revolution, the New York Society which was organized in 1876. The SR was founded by John Austin Stevens who envisioned an aristocratic social and hereditary organization along the lines of the Society of the Cincinnati. In 1889 William Osborn McDowell, a New Jersey financier and businessman, organized the New Jersey Society of the Sons of the Revolution but was unwilling to accept the SR's requirement that other state societies be subordinate to the New York society. Furthermore, McDowell wanted the society to become more of a mass movement of descendants of Revolutionary patriots rather than an exclusive social club. As a result, McDowell organized the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) at Fraunces Tavern in New York on April 30, 1889. This was the centennial for the inauguration of George Washington as the First President of the United States of America in 1789. SAR membership number 1 was assigned to McDowell. In addition to organizing the SAR, McDowell worked with six women to organize the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution on July 29, 1890.\n\nThe SAR was formally granted a congressional charter by an act of Congress under Title 36 of the United States Code on June 9, 1906. The act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a member.\nMembership in the society is open to any male of \"good repute\" who can prove lineal bloodline descent from an ancestor who actively supported the American Revolution. Acceptable ancestors include:\n\nNo state society or chapter may discriminate against an applicant on the basis of race or creed. The SAR claims a membership of over 37,000 members in over 550 chapters representing all 50 states in the United States, as well as societies in Canada, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Overall, about 200,000 descendants have been admitted since the founding of the S.A.R. in 1890.\n\nThe governance of the Sons of the American Revolution is made up of 10 National (General) Officers, 15 Vice-Presidents that preside over separate geographical regions and a Trustee elected from each state and international society. These officers meet several times over the year to discuss business pertaining to the society. The National Officers meet at least four times during their term of office, unless special meetings are called. The Trustees meet twice each year at the Society's Headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. These meetings, known as the Fall and Spring Leadership Meetings, are normally held in late September and early March. During the Leadership Meetings committee recommendations and the society's budget are approved. While only the National Officers, Vice-Presidents and Trustees have the right to vote on the floor, all SAR members are welcome to attend and may request appointment to committees. The National Officers and Trustees also meet during the National Congress held in late June or early July of each year. Unlike the Leadership Meetings which always take place at the Society's National Headquarters, the National Congress is held in different locations throughout the United States. Locations are often selected in order to honor a historical event in United States history or in the history of the SAR, and there is an effort to alternate the meetings between the Eastern and Western United States. The National Congress is responsible for electing the National Officers and approving changes to the Society's constitution, along with any other motions brought before it. In addition to the National Officers, Vice-Presidents and Trustees, State and International Society Presidents and specially elected delegates from each society also attend with voting privileges. The number of delegates are determined by each State or International Society's membership size.\n\nIn addition to the larger meetings previously listed, there are over 60 standing and special committees that SAR members are appointed to in order to oversee the Society's welfare. Some of these committees include: facilities, insurance, genealogy, library, merchandise, medals and awards. All SAR members are welcome to participate on committees and are appointed by the Society's President General for a one-year term. There are no term-limits and all committee members have the right to vote on the committee's decisions.\n\nThe President-General for 2019-2020 is John T. Manning He was sworn in as President-General at the 129th National Congress in Orange County, CA. The Executive Director is Don Shaw of the Kentucky Society.\n\nThe National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution has held a collection of genealogical reference dating back to 1889. Materials were originally kept by the Secretary General or Registrar General up until 1926, when the materials were moved to the Registrar General's office in Washington, D.C., in 1927, this collection was moved to the recently purchased Sixteenth Street Headquarters Building, and the collection had grown to 914 books by 1933. From this point until the move of Headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Louisville, Kentucky, the book collection grew at a rapid pace, growing to approximately 25,000 items by 1988. At this point, the Library was on the Second floor of the Headquarters building on South Fourth Street, and possessed a 544-square-foot vault for books not out in the library due to space.\n\nBecause of continuing growth, the SAR Library was moved in 2010 to a renovated building on West Main Street in the heart of the Historic Museum District of downtown Louisville. By this point, the Library collection had grown to over 58,000 items, mostly covering the Revolutionary War period, but also containing other genealogical materials. The library collection includes family histories, state genealogy materials, federal censuses, Revolutionary War pension applications, and CD collections, and the library separates materials based on State. The library also provides access to online research databases, including Ancestry.com, Footnote.com, and Heritage Quest Online.\n\nThe society operates a Merchandise Department that sells items intended for both SAR members and the general public. Among the products available to the general public are: clothing apparel for men and women, Revolutionary War replicas such as Liberty Bells and Field Cannons, jewelry for men and women such as lapel pins and cuff links, along with cups, mugs, key-chains, books, CDs, videos and knickknacks. Items intended for SAR members only include: clothing, decals, license plate holders and frames, certificates and medals corresponding to SAR activities, medals designed to reward active and retired military personnel, firefighters, EMS, JROTC and ROTC, individuals involved in education, Eagle Scouts and many others.\n\nThe Merchandise Department is located on the lower level of the SAR Genealogical Library, located at 809 West Main Street, just across the street from the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory.\n\nThe society is involved in historical research, raising funds for local scholarships and educational awards, and preservation of sites and documents related to the American Revolution. The SAR petitioned Congress to store Revolutionary era documents in a fire-proof area and make them available to the public, leading to the creation of the National Archives. It is also active in cataloging and marking Revolutionary War patriot graves and conducts an annual Eagle Scout scholarship program. The society is active in promoting \"patriotism,\" and was instrumental in the establishment of Constitution Day. Several SAR societies and chapters have active color guard groups that appear in various public and private venues as a means of community outreach.\n\nThe Sons of the American Revolution hosts two Leadership Meetings and one National Congress every year. The two leadership meetings are held in the Spring and Fall in Louisville, KY at the Brown Hotel. The National Congress is held at a different location every year during the Summer. The 2017 National Congress took place in Knoxville, Tennessee, while the 2018 Congress will take place in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe SAR's national headquarters, located along Museum Row in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, contains the organization's administrative staff offices, SAR Genealogical Research Library, and the future site of an American Revolutionary War Education Center. The SAR is currently raising funds to finish the Center's development. The building houses original and copied art that commemorates important people and events of the Revolutionary War, as well as historical uniforms, flags, documents, and other colonial era pieces.\n\nThe SAR insignia consists of a Maltese cross surrounded by a garland, with a relief of George Washington in a center circle.\n\nThe cross's vertical bar represents the commandment \"You Shall Love Your God\"; the horizontal bar represents the commandment \"You Shall Love Your Neighbor as Yourself.\" The four limbs are a reminder of the four cardinal virtues; its eight points represent eight spiritual injunctions:\n\nSurrounding the relief of Washington in the center are the words \"LIBERTAS ET PATRIA,\" a reminder of the United States Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.\n\nThe insignia is normally worn suspended by a ribbon of blue, white and gold (buff) on the wearer's left breast. National officers and former state and chapter presidents wear the insignia suspended from a neck ribbon of the Society's colors.\n\nOn other occasions a rosette in the Society's colors is worn on the wearers left lapel.\n\nTo date, 17 presidents of the United States have been members of the SAR. President Grant was admitted posthumously in recognition of his being a member of the Sons of Revolutionary Sires, whose members were later admitted to membership in the SAR.\n\n\nOf the presidents who lived since the SAR's founding in 1889 and are not listed above, presidents Grover Cleveland, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all had patriot ancestors but did not join the SAR. Presidents Woodrow Wilson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump did not have patriot ancestors.\n\nOf the 22 presidents who served prior to the founding of the SAR, six qualify as patriot ancestors – George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson. Two others, Grant and Hayes, were members of SAR. Of the other 14, only one, Martin Van Buren, is not known to have a patriot ancestor.\n\n\nIn addition to the above, the following vice presidents were SAR compatriots and later became President of the United States: Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.\n\n\n\nThe following 38 SAR Compatriots are known to have received the Medal of Honor. It is possible that there are other Medal of Honor recipients who were SAR Compatriots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an incomplete list of the presidents-general of the Sons of the American Revolution. The first President General was Lucius Deming. There have been three Honorary President Generals named. Four President Generals have died in office. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811601", "title": "Tancredi", "text": "Tancredi\n\nTancredi is a \"melodramma eroico\" (opera seria or 'heroic' opera) in two acts by composer Gioachino Rossini and librettist Gaetano Rossi (who was also to write \"Semiramide\" ten years later), based on Voltaire's play \"Tancrède\" (1760). The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813, and because \"Il signor Bruschino\" premiered in late January, the composer must have completed \"Tancredi\" in less than a month. The overture, borrowed from \"La pietra del paragone\", is a popular example of Rossini's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded.\n\nConsidered by Stendhal, Rossini's earliest biographer, to be \"high amongst the composer's masterworks\", and describing it as \"a genuine thunderbolt out of a clear, blue sky for the Italian lyric theatre,\" his librettist Gaetano Rossi notes that, with it, \"Rossini rose to glory\". Richard Osborne proclaims it to be \"his fully fledged \"opera seria\" and it established him, more of less instantly, as Italy's leading composer of contemporary opera.\"\n\nAlthough the original version had a happy ending (as required by the \"opera seria\" tradition), soon after the Venice premiere, Rossini—who was more of a Neo-classicist than a Romantic, notes Servadio—had the poet Luigi Lechi rework the libretto to emulate the original tragic ending by Voltaire. In this new ending, presented at the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara on 21 March 1813, Tancredi wins the battle but is mortally wounded, and only then does he learn that Amenaide never betrayed him. Argirio marries the lovers in time for Tancredi to die in his wife's arms.\n\nAs has been stated by Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner, it was the rediscovery of the score of this ending in 1974 (although elsewhere Gossett provides evidence that it was 1976) that resulted in the version which is usually performed today.\n\nBy the time he was twenty, Rossini's reputation was beginning to grow, and he was now regarded as \"'a maestro di cartello', a composer whose name alone guarantees a public\" Success with \"La pietra del paragone\" for Milan in September was great, but delays caused him to be late in Venice for his next commission at the Teatro San Moisè, \"L'occasione fa il ladro\". Other comedies had preceded \"L'occasione\", but its success ensured a fifth opera for that house. This was \"Il Signor Bruschino\", which was presented on 27 January 1813 and which the composer wrote more-or-less parallel to preparing \"Tancredi\", a commission for this opera having been accepted from Venice's most prestigious house, La Fenice, the previous autumn.\n\nOther treatments of the Tancredi story had been prepared, the most recent being that of Stefano Pavesi in 1812. However, many of Rossini's formal inventions, seen in his earlier one-act operas, are here incorporated with great effect and formalism. As Gossett notes \"The opera established a new formal synthesis, new compositional models, with, through, and in spite of which Italian composers were to operate.\"\n\nThe revised ending for Ferrara, March, 1813\n\nThis revised version of the opera, presented a month after its Venice premiere, incorporates Voltaire's original ending. The music for this ending was withdrawn, it disappeared, and was not discovered until 1976.\n\nAccording to Richard Osborne, the 1813 re-workings for Ferrara were not a success and \"Rossini withdrew the revision and, as was his habit, redistributed some of the music in later work\". In \"Divas and Scholars\", musicologist Philip Gossett recounts how this ending was rediscovered: \n\nFollowing the discovery, the preparation of the critical edition for the Fondazione Rossini by Philip Gossett and others at the University of Chicago began in 1976.\n\nDecember 1813 revision for Milan\n\nIn addition to restoring the happy ending, by the end of 1813 and in time for the Milan premiere in December at the new Teatro Ré, Rossini had also restored the cut second duet and had re-written and restored Argirio's cut aria. Other changes included Roggiero becoming a tenor with a new aria \"Torni d'amor la face\", two different arias being composed for Argirio, and both duets for Tancredi and Amenaide being restored to their original locations.\n\nWhile Tancredi and Amenaide are happily reunited, he is given \"an entirely new \"rondo\" in lieu of the more elaborate \"gran scena\" of the original score after Tancredi learns from Argirio that her letter was written for him, and not for Solamir (rather than there being a denial from Solamir).\n\n19th century\n\n\"Tancredi\" premiered in February 1813 at La Fenice in Venice with Adelaide Malanotte in the title role. The first two performances suffered because of vocal problems from its two female principals, but its success was assured over six performances into the following month.\n\nIt was quickly re-mounted in a revised version in Ferrara in March of that year which reverted to Voltaire's tragic ending, but audiences disliked it and subsequent performances there reverted to the Venice ending, with a further revisions appearing in Milan in December. Gossett established in 1971 that, later, Rossini also participated in other revisions for performances elsewhere in Italy, including those at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 1814 and the Naples premiere given at the Teatro del Fondo in 1816 and again in 1818.\n\nHowever, Heather Hadlock notes that it was the Milanese version of December 1813 which became \"something like a definitive form, and in this form it took Italy by storm\", Other Italian houses presented the Venice version, including the Teatro Apollo in Rome (1814), the Teatro Regio di Torino (1814 and 1829), La Fenice again (1815, 1823 and 1833), and the Teatro San Moisè in Venice in March 1816 when, in another revision, it is the dying Solamir who professes Amenaide's innocence, and Tancredi returns home in triumph.\n\nPhilip Gossett's research in 1971 states that \"until about 1825 the musical text was rather fluid. The first Ricordi edition (1829), which differs significantly from the later ones, corresponds to the Milanese version.\", \nbut many other Italian cities saw the opera, including Florence (in 1814, 1816, and 1825), Padua (1814), Livorno (1815), Vicenza (1816), Macerata (1817), Camerino (1828), Viterbo (1828), Milan (1829), and Trieste (1830).\n\nOutside of Italy, it was given in Corfù (1822), Lisbon (as \"Tacredo\") (1826), and Geneva (1828). The opera was first performed in England at the King's Theatre in London on 4 May 1820 with Fanny Corri-Paltoni as Amenaide. Its French premiere was given by the Théâtre-Lyrique Italien at the Salle Louvois in Paris on 23 April 1822 with Giuditta Pasta in the title role. It was seen in Portugal for the first time at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos on 18 September 1822 (as \"Tancredo\") and was given its La Scala premiere on 8 November 1823 with Brigida Lorenzani as Tancredi.\n\nThe United States premiere occurred on 31 December 1825 at the Park Theatre in New York City using the revised Ferrara version by Lechi. The Paris Opéra mounted the work for the first time with Maria Malibran in the title role on 30 March 1829. After an 1833 revival at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, \"Tancredi\" was not mounted again until almost 120 years later.\n\n20th century and beyond \n\nThe Maggio Musicale Fiorentino revived the work on 17 May 1952 with Giulietta Simionato in the title role, Teresa Stich-Randall as Amenaide, Francesco Albanese as Argirio, Mario Petri as Orbazzano, and Tullio Serafin conducting. The opera was given at the Collegiate Theatre as part of the Camden Festival in April 1971 by the Basilica Opera.\n\nWith the discovery of the long-lost music for the March 1813 Ferrara revision and the resulting preparation and completion of the critical edition, the work was revived when mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who had expressed interest as early as 1972 in performing the Ferrara edition if it ever came to light took on the title role at the Houston Grand Opera on 13 October 1977. Horne, who quickly became strongly associated with that role, insisted on the tragic Ferrara ending, citing that it is more consistent with the overall tone of the opera and that she \"did not find the happy ending convincing\". Indeed, most of the recordings of this opera today use the Ferrara conclusion, while some include the Venice finale as an extra track.\n\nHorne's triumphant performances as Tancredi in Houston soon led to invitations from other opera houses to sing the role, and it is largely through her efforts that the opera enjoyed a surge of revivals during the latter half of the 20th century. She sang the part for performances at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (1977), the San Francisco Opera (1979), the Aix-en-Provence Festival (1981), La Fenice (1981, 1983), and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1989) among others.\n\nContralto Ewa Podleś achieved recognition in the title role, performing it at the Vlaamse Opera (1991), La Scala (1993), the Berlin State Opera (1996), Polish National Opera at Warsaw (2000), the Canadian Opera Company (2005), the Caramoor International Music Festival (2006), the Teatro Real (2007), and Opera Boston (2009) among others. She also recorded the role in 1995. Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova has also been praised in the role, singing it at the Salzburg Festival (1992), with the Opera Orchestra of New York (1997), and on a 1996 recording with the Bavarian Radio Chorus and Munich Radio Orchestra.\n\nPier Luigi Pizzi staged a new production of \"Tancredi\" for the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 1982\nwhich originally utilised both the tragic and happy endings – the former being interpolated as a \"dream sequence\" for Amenaide. He also designed both costumes and scenery. The production was conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti and featured Lucia Valentini Terrani in the title role, as well as Dalmacio Gonzales as Argirio, Katia Ricciarelli as Amenaide, Giancarlo Luccardi as Orbazzano and, as Isaura, Bernadette Manca di Nissa – who later went on to perform the title role for the 1992 live DVD recording. The production was also revived at Pesaro in 1991, 1999, and 2004.\n\n\"Tancredi\" was staged at 2003 at Polish National Opera at Warsaw, in the performance directed by Tomasz Konina and conducted by Alberto Zedda, the title role was sung by Ewa Podleś, with original tragic ending. The second production in Poland took place in Warsaw Chamber Opera in 2008.\n\nIn 2005 the production went to Rome and Florence (where it was filmed for DVD with Daniela Barcellona in the title role), and then it was presented by the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 2011, with Alberto Zedda conducting. Barcellona sang Tancredi again in a new staging of the opera at the Teatro Regio di Torino in November 2009 after reprising the part in February 2009 at the Teatro de la Maestranza. The Theater an der Wien mounted the work for the first time in October 2009 with Vivica Genaux in the title role and René Jacobs conducting.\n\n\"Tancredi\" was presented in concert by the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris in December 2009 with Nora Gubisch as Tancredi. In addition, as part of its Rossini revivals series, it presented a fully staged production in May 2014 with Marie-Nicole Lemieux in the title role and Patrizia Ciofi as Amenaide. The production used the \"unhappy\" Ferrara ending, but incorporated many of the changes and reversions found in the December 1813 version for Milan.\n\nIn 2018 Teatro Nuovo presented alternating performances of the original Venetian score (including the portions that have been replaced in most modern productions) and a version they called \"Tancredi rifatto\", incorporating every known substitute piece by Rossini (including the aria written to replace \"Di tanti palpiti\"). \n\nBackground\n\nThere is both conflict and war between the Byzantine empire (with which it has an unstable truce) and the Saracen armies headed by Solamir, but exhausted by external war, there are internal conflicts as well. The soldier Tancredi and his family have been stripped of their estates and inheritances, and he himself has been banished since his youth. Two noble families, headed by Argirio and Orbazzano, have been warring for years and they begin to reconcile. Also present is Solamir, the Moorish general. Argirio's daughter, Amenaide, is secretly in love with Tancredi. Prior to the beginning of the opera, she has sent him a letter (without naming him in it), and it is this letter which complicates the proceedings which follow.\n\n\"Overture\"\n\n\"Scene 1: A gallery in Argirio's palace\"\n\nWarring nobles Argirio, leader of the Senate in Syracuse, and Orbazzano and their men celebrate a truce and the end of a civil war: Chorus: \"Pace, onore, fede, amore\" / \"Peace, honour, faith, love / Rule now\". Along with Isaura and her ladies, Argirio proclaims that this unity reinforces a new security for the city against the Moorish forces led by Solamir: \"Se amistà verace, é pura\" / \"If you keep in your heart true friendship\". He names Orbazzano as the leader against the Moors. However, Argirio warns the assembled forces against a possible greater threat, that from the banished Tancredi, a statement which disturbs Isaura. Argirio then summons his daughter, Amenaide to appear.\n\nShe joins in the general songs of triumph which are expressed by the assembly, but is also disturbed by the fact that her secret beloved, Tancredi, has not rejoined her in spite of the fact that she has written a letter to him asking him to do so now that he is returning in disguise to Syracuse. The Senate, having already given Tancredi and his family's confiscated estates to Orbazzano, Argirio then offers Amenaide in marriage to him in order to help solidify the truce. He wishes to have the ceremony performed immediately, and although she dutifully consents to the arrangement, she pleads with her father to postpone it until the following day. All leave except Isaura who laments upon the situation in which Amenaide is now placed: \"Amenaide sventturata!\" / \"Unhappy Amenaide, what a dreadful day for you\".\n\n\"Scene 2: A garden in the Palace\"\n\nThe garden is close to the seashore. Roggiero, then Tancredi and his men, disembark from a ship. Not having received Amenaide's letter, he pledges to help defend the city against the invaders and to seek out his beloved: Aria: \"Oh patria! dolce, e ingrate patria\" / O my country, dear, thankless native land\". Roggiero is dispatched with a message for Amenaide, and he sends his followers to spread the word that an unknown knight has arrived to help save the city. His thoughts turn to Amenaide: \"Tu che accendi questo core\" / \"You who set aflame this heart\", and then to how much pain he has caused her: \"Di tanti palpiti, di tante pene\" / \"After such beating of the heart, such torment\".\n\nWhen all have left, Tancredi sees Argirio and his daughter enter the garden. He hides, but can overhear their conversation. Argirio informs Amenaide and the followers who accompany them that all are invited to the wedding which will take place at noon. The young woman pleads for more time, but is told that the ceremony must take place right away. Argirio continues by informing all that the enemy leader, Solamir, has surrounded the city, and has asked for Amenaide's hand in marriage. Orbazzano then states that he will lead the people of Syracuse against the enemy, the recent action of the Senate having condemned to death all traitors. Argirio's aria: \"Della patria ogni neminco danna a morte il Senato\" / \"The Senate has condemned to death any enemy of the country\".\n\nAs Argirio leaves, Amenaide immediately regrets that she has indirectly involved Tancredi by writing to him: \"Che feci! incaula!\" / \"What have I done! Thoughtless woman!\". Tancredi then appears and Amenaide tells him that he must immediately escape. Coldly, she rejects his claims of loving her, although the couple, in spite of their differences, then laments the dangerous situation in which they find themselves: Duet: \"L'aura che interno spiri\" / \"The air you breathe brings mortal danger\".\n\n\"Scene 3: A public square close to the cathedral\"\n\nPeople are gathered in the square for the wedding ceremony. Argirio assures all that the new-found unity between the two factions will be strengthened by the marriage. In disguise, Tancredi appears and offers his services. Privately, he feels that Amenaide has betrayed him by accepting the marriage but, when she refuses to go ahead with it, an angry Orbazzano enters. Publicly, he denounces her and, having overheard the prior conversation, declares that the marriage will not take place. Immediately, he produces a letter, which he assumes was intended for Solamir and which appears to implicate her in a treasonous plot to overthrow Syracuse by calling upon the recipient to come and capture the city. [In reality it is the letter which Amedaide had sent to Tancredi, deliberately omitted his name for his protection, and which had never reached him].\n\nThe assembled crowd is horrified: \"Die in disgrace, woman!\" they proclaim. Amenaide swears that she is innocent, but her father denounces her, as does Tancredi. She is dragged off to prison to await death as all except her faithful Isaura proclaim: \"Quale infausto orrendo giorno!\" / \"A day of disaster, what an ill-starred day...a day of disasters and terrors.\"\n\n\"Scene 1: A gallery in Argirio's castle\"\n\nAn angry Orbazzano reflects on Amenaide's apparent treachery and her contempt of him: \"Vedesti? L'indegna!\" / \"You have seen? She spurns me, the unworthy woman\". Aside, Isaura pities Amenaide's fate, reminding Argirio that Amenaide is his own daughter: \"E tua figlia!\" / \"She is your own daughter\". The assembled knights are divided in their emotions, and while Argirio expresses his sorrow at the turn of events, (Aria: \"Oh Dio! Crudel! qual nome caro e fetal oe mi rammenti\" / \"You remind me of that name both dear and fatal\"), he reluctantly signs the death warrant, with some of the group of knights pleading for mercy, others supporting his decision. \nAll but Isaura and Orbazzano leave. She reproaches him for his cruelty and barbarous behaviour, and, then alone after he leaves, she pleads for divine aid for Amenaide: Aria: \"Tu che I miseri conforti\" / \"You who console the miserable, give her endurance\".\n\n\"Scene 2: Inside the prison\"\n\nIn chains, Amenaide enters: Aria: \"Di mia vita infelice\" / \"Here I am at the end of my unhappy life\". She cries out to Tancredi \"I die for you!\": Aria: \"No, che il morir non è\" / \"No, death is not so terrible to me if I die for love\". In the end, she believes that he will learn the truth and \"he will know the constancy of my heart\".\n\nInto the prison come Orbazzano and his followers, determined to see the execution carried out. But he asks if there is anyone willing to defend the traitor. Tancredi, although he still believes that his love has been betrayed and that Amenaide is a traitor, steps forward. He challenges Orbazzano to a duel in defense of Amenaide's honor and life, and throws down his gauntlet before his adversary. Throughout the men's interchange, Amenaide urges Tancredi to prove that she is innocent. Orbazzano embraces the unknown knight, seeking to know his identity as does Argirio who, in a duet with Tancredi, pleads: \"Ah! se de'mali mieri\" / \"Ah! If you have pity in your heart for my sufferings, At least reveal to me who you are. Comfort me in my pain\". In return, Tancredi declares \"Heaven has been my enemy since my childhood. You will know who I am one day, But do not hate me...\" and the trumpet sounds, signaling the start of the contest. About to rush off, he proclaims \"To the field; I burn with glory and with fury\".\n\nIn another part of the prison, Amenaide learns what has transpired: she prays for protection for Tancredi, begging him to return to her a victor: Aria: \"Gran Dio! Deh! tu proteggi\" / \"Just God whom I humbly adore, You can read in my heart, You know whether I am guilty, And for whom I ask your favour\". From outside, a roar announces Tancredi's victory, while she declares: \"In this moment I see it, I feel it.\"\n\n\"Scene 3: The main square of the town\"\n\nTancredi arrives triumphant and the people rejoice. However, as sweet as victory may be, he resolves to leave Sicily and, as Amenaide approaches him, he still believes that she has been unfaithful and is unwilling to talk to her. In a duet, they express their conflicting emotions: Duet: \"L'asciami: non t'escolto\" / \"Let me go; I will not listen to you\". She then demands that he kill her, but both leave while Roggiero remains, having learned the truth from Isaura: \"S'avverassero pure I detti suoi!\" / \"If only her words were true\". But he expresses the hope that, if Amenaide is indeed innocent, then \"May the torch of love return shining, smiling and fair\".\n\n\"Scene 4: A cavern in a mountain range with Mt. Etna in the distance\n\nAlone and close to the Saracens' camp, Tancredi reflects upon his sad destiny: Aria: \"Dove sono io?\" / \"Where am I? Through what horrors does my despair lead me?\", all the while recalling Amenaide's betrayal: \"Oh that I could forget!\" The Saracens appear proclaiming \"Regna il terror nella Citta\" / \"Terror reigns in the city\". With the arrival of the knights of Syracuse along with Argirio and Amenaide, who come in search of him, Amenaide is told that peace will follow if she agrees to marry Solamir. Tancredi defies the Saracens, expressing willingness to fight to the death: Rondo: \"Perchè turbar la calma\" / \"Why trouble the peace of my heart\". Urged to go into battle and, when all is over, Tancredi emerges victorious and learns that the dying Solamir has testified to Amenaide's innocence.\n\nIn a moment of general rejoicing, the lovers are reunited: \"Fra quai soave palpiti\" / \"Gently beats my heart\". Tancredi, Agirio and Amenaide are united in expressing their joy: \"Si grande è il mio contento\" / \"So great is my joy\", and Isaura joins them in the general rejoicing.\n\nIn regard to Rossini's innovations which appear in this, his first \"opera seria\", the \"Grove Dictionary\" notes that they \"were derived from his early one-act operas\" and writer Gaia Servadio notes that [the opera] marks an important stage in the development of opera through the innovations that Rossini brought. With self-assurance and guts, he introduced changes now often taken for granted: the recitatives are short and linked to the context of the arias; there is a new and masterful balance between the dramatic, the lyrical, and the musical; and the chorus makes its first appearance in an \"opera seria\"\n\nBut it is in the innovations which move away from accepted formulas and which are seen in the finale of the opera in its Ferrara edition that Philip Gossett finds the most striking in \"Tancredi\": \"the 'Cavatina Finale' as Rossini called the concluding moments of the opera, depart so completely from typical finale designs of the period that we can easily comprehend their failure to gain popular approval. Gone are the coloratura flourishes; gone is a more elaborate orchestration; gone are requirements of phrase construction and cadential repetition; gone, in short, are the conventions that usually rule Italian opera. Instead, the concluding moments of the opera mirror each word of the dying hero, supported essentially by strings alone.\"\n\nAdditionally, we find in Gossett and Brauner an explanation of another aspect of Rossini's compositional style: in his vocal writing, although the opera continues to use \"closed numbers separated by \"secco\" recitatives, a flexibility of style makes possible extensive dramatic activity within numbers.\" They continue stating that it is in the duets that a sectional form is employed so that \"the opening section allows dramatic confrontation between the characters, who express their often differing emotions in parallel stanzas.\" There follows a lyrical section – \"with further dramatic interaction\" – and then the cabaletta which allows for greater confrontation or accord, thus reflecting any changes in the dramatic configuration.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "1811609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811609", "title": "Do the Evolution", "text": "Do the Evolution\n\n\"Do the Evolution\" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \"Do the Evolution\" is the seventh track on the band's fifth studio album, \"Yield\" (1998). Despite the lack of a commercial single release, the song managed to reach number 33 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, \"rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003)\".\n\n\"Do the Evolution\" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament does not appear on the track. Gossard recorded the bass line for the track. Vedder said that it is his favorite song from \"Yield\". He stated, \"I can listen to it like it's some band that just came out of nowhere. I just like the song. I was able to listen to it as an outside observer and just really play it over and over. Maybe because I was singing it from a third person so it didn't really feel like me singing.\"\n\nWhen speaking about \"Do the Evolution\", Vedder stated, \"That song is all about someone who's drunk with technology, who thinks they're the controlling living being on this planet. It's another one I'm not singing as myself.\" Pearl Jam has stated that the novel \"Ishmael\" influenced the writing of \"Yield\", and according to the novel's writer, Daniel Quinn, this song comes the closest to expressing the ideas of the book. Vedder stated:\nThis Daniel Quinn book, \"Ishmael\"...I've never recommended a book before, but I would actually, in an interview, recommend it to everyone...But this book, it's kind of the book of my ... My whole year has been kind of with these thoughts in mind. And on an evolutionary level, that man has been on this planet for 3 million years, so that you have this number line that goes like this [hands wide apart]. And that we're about to celebrate the year 2000, which is this [holds hands less than one inch apart]. So here's this number line; here's what we know and celebrate. This book is a conversation with a man and an ape. And the ape really has it all together. He kinda knows the differences between him and the man, and points out how slight they are, and it creates an easy analogy for what man has done, thinking that they were the end-all. That man is the end-all thing on this earth. That the earth was around even so much longer before the 3 million years. Fifty million years of sharks and all these living things. Then man comes out of the muck, and 3 million years later he's standing, and now he's controlling everything and killing it. Just in the last hundred! Which is just a speck on this line. So what are we doin' here? This is just a good reminder...And I'm anxious to see what happens. You know, I've got a good seat for whatever happens next. It'll be interesting.\n\nWithout being released as a single, \"Do the Evolution\" peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 34 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs chart in 1998. In Canada, the song reached the top 50 on the Canadian Singles Chart. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, \"Do the Evolution\" received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.\n\nIn E! Online's review of \"Yield\", \"Do the Evolution\" was described as having a \"Neil Young-Beck hybrid feel.\" Tom Sinclair of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated, \"On the album's most gleeful hip shaker, \"Do the Evolution\", Vedder howls throwaway lyrics...while the guitars gnash and grind at the primitive melody, briefly evoking the gnarly cacophony of the Stooges' monumental \"Fun House\".\"\n\nThe animated music video for \"Do the Evolution\" was co-directed by Kevin Altieri, known for his direction on \"\", and Todd McFarlane, better known for his work with the popular comic book \"Spawn\" and Korn's 1999 \"Freak on a Leash\" video. The video was produced by Joe Pearson, the president of Epoch Ink animation, and Terry Fitzgerald at TME. It was written and developed by Pearson and Altieri with input from McFarlane and Vedder. The total production time on the music video was 16 weeks. The animation pre-production was produced by Epoch Ink Animation at their studio in Santa Monica, California. Under Altieri and Pearson’s supervision the Epoch team boarded and designed the short in less than six weeks. Once McFarlane, Vedder, and Sony gave their final approvals, the short was taken to Korea by Altieri and Pearson for animation at Sun Min Image Pictures and Jireh Animation. Over a four-week period, a team of more than one hundred artists worked to deliver the finished animation.\n\nOnce the final animation was back in Los Angeles, California, Altieri, McFarlane, and Vedder edited the final cut at Vittello Productions. In a press release, McFarlane stated, \"We choose to work with people who convey a particular attitude and this video is a tribute to that attitude,\" while Pearl Jam stated, \"As artists we are challenged to expand the meaning of our work and by utilizing this visual medium and working with a visionary like Todd, we were able to further explore some of the themes we depicted in the song \"Do the Evolution\". Basically we've tried to make a good stoner video.\" The video premiered on August 24, 1998 on MTV's \"120 Minutes\". The video was the band's first since the final video for \"Ten\", \"Oceans\". At the 1999 Grammy Awards, the music video received a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form. The video clip for \"Do the Evolution\" can be found on the \"Touring Band 2000\" DVD as one of the Special Features.\n\nThroughout the video, a black-haired woman (similar in appearance to the character Death from the DC comic book series, \"The Sandman\") dances and laughs, representing \"Death\" as it follows mankind through all of its history. The video begins with the evolution of life, from the smallest cell to the extinction of dinosaurs and reign of \"Homo sapiens\". The video then cuts back and forth throughout human history, depicting man's primitive, violent nature has essentially unchanged over the centuries. Such depictions include a knight preparing for the coming slaughter during the Crusades, a ritual dance by America's KKK (the dance is repeated with other groups throughout the video), a rally by Nazi-esque troops (with a symbol reminiscent of the Sig Rune instead of a swastika), concentration camp prisoners, a book burning, carnage upon a World War I-era battlefield (apparently a tribute to \"Peace on Earth\", a 1930s MGM anti-war cartoon directed by Hugh Harman), a girl stepping on an anthill as she runs blissfully through a field with the image suddenly changing to that of a landmine going off (as if the mine had been buried under the anthill itself), a death row inmate nervously waiting on an electric chair, the apparent virtual-reality rape of a woman, and the bombing of a Vietnamese village by an American jet, specifically an A-4 Skyhawk, the pilot of which removes his oxygen mask to reveal a skull laughing wildly, and a scene with a crying baby representing \"Bloody Saturday\". Every scene portrayed complements the song's meaning and tightly follows the lyrics. When Vedder sings \"Buying stocks on the day of the crash,\" a scene is shown where businessmen are committing suicide by jumping from buildings, a reference to the apocryphal suicides of Black Thursday during the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n\nOther social and environmental issues such as slavery, whaling, Manifest Destiny, uncontrolled urbanization, vivisection, pollution, genetic modification and techno-progressivism are included. The music video blames humankind's brutality on leadership; with various scenes depicting a judge, a bishop or pope, an Asian political leader and an American president candidate, who is being portrayed as a puppet, controlled by someone unseen, from behind the scene. The video concludes in what seems to be future scenarios of the self-destruction of the human race, including the carpet bombing of a city of clones by futuristic aircraft, computers hijacking the human mind, and finally a nuclear explosion which leaves not only a city in ruins, but the planet damaged beyond recognition. However, near the end of the animation, the earth is briefly seen as an ovum, suggesting a rebirth and the perpetuation of the human condition. During the sequence of flashing images near the end of the video an image of a yield sign being smashed at the corner can be seen, which references the album title and cover art.\n\n\"Do the Evolution\" was first performed live at the band's November 12, 1997 concert in Santa Cruz, California at The Catalyst. Live performances of \"Do the Evolution\" can be found on the live album \"Live on Two Legs\", various official bootlegs, the \"Live at the Gorge 05/06\" box set, and the live album \"Live at Lollapalooza 2007\". Performances of the song are also included on the DVDs \"Single Video Theory\", \"Touring Band 2000\", \"Live at the Showbox\", and \"Live at the Garden\". On \"Touring Band 2000\", Vedder adds the lyrics \"free the West Memphis 3!\" to the song.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811611", "title": "What You Waiting For?", "text": "What You Waiting For?\n\n\"What You Waiting For?\" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" (2004). Written by Stefani and Linda Perry, the song is the album's opening track and was released as Stefani's debut solo single. \"What You Waiting For?\" details Stefani's lack of inspiration, fear of producing the album, as well as her reaction to pressures exerted by her record label. It is primarily an electropop song and introduces Stefani's four back-up dancers, the Harajuku Girls, who had a major input into the album's production.\n\n\"What You Waiting For?\" was released as the album's lead single; according to Stefani, as an \"explanation for doing the record\". The song was well received by critics, and was frequently cited as a highlight of the album. The single was commercially successful, topping the chart in Australia and reaching the top 10 in several countries. It was certified gold in the United States, and was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has been remixed a number of times, and was covered by the indie rock band Franz Ferdinand and singer Marina Diamandis.\n\nDuring the night of the 2003 Grammy Awards, Perry forced Stefani into a chokehold, and demanded that they were \"gonna write songs together!\", to which Stefani reluctantly agreed. Soon after, Stefani finished the Rock Steady Tour with her band No Doubt, and took a call from her label, who informed her that Perry was in a studio ready to collaborate, and that Perry \"only [had] five days out of the whole year to work with [her].\" Stefani has since admitted that she was frustrated by not being able to see her husband Gavin Rossdale, and was intimidated at the thought of collaboration, in particular with Perry, who she did not feel was qualified to write dance music. Stefani was exhausted by the recently completed tour, and shortly afterwards suffered an emotional breakdown, which she spent in bed crying.\n\nDuring their first day of work, the two wrote a song titled \"Fine by You\", which Stefani later described as \"a stupid love song, but really good\". Perry remarked that the song \"wasn't right\", and the track was excluded from the album. The session was unproductive, due in part to Stefani's self-consciousness and writer's block, and she at one stage broke down in tears in the studio. Stefani has since admitted that writing songs without her band members felt \"humiliating and intimidating even if they're sweet and excited, because you're drowning in their creativity\".\n\nThat night, Perry began work on another track, which she played for Stefani the next day to motivate her. Stefani was impressed with the track, and Perry asked her, \"What are you waiting for?\" According to Perry, Stefani took the question as a dare, replying, \"You're totally challenging me, right?\" The two began writing lyrics for the new wave-styled song based on Stefani's writer's block and fears about making a solo record, and it grew into \"What You Waiting For?\"\n\nStefani came up with the idea of the Harajuku Girls while writing the song. Stefani first saw the women of Harajuku, known for their unique style drawing from Gothic Lolita and cyberpunk fashion, in 1996 and had admired them since. She decided to mention them in the line \"You Harajuku Girls, damn you got some wicked style\", and the concept grew into a running theme on \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\", which went as far as to feature one song named after and dedicated to them.\n\n\"What You Waiting For?\" combines the genres of electropop, new wave, dance-rock, and funk, and was composed in common time and in the key of G minor. It is written in verse-chorus form, and its instrumentation derives from the guitar and electronic keyboard. The song opens with an emotional piano solo as a tribute to Stefani's time with No Doubt. The verse begins at only 60 beats per minute and gradually slows, mixed with sounds of applause from the audience. A beat set at 138 BPM begins, and Stefani repeats the phrase \"tick-tock\", commonly interpreted as a reference to her maternal clock and the pressures she felt about producing the album.\n\nStefani creates an argument between lyrical personas by alternating her vocal range and point of view. Stefani's vocal range spans two octaves in the song, from G to G. In a melody similar to that of Weezer's \"Hash Pipe\", one side of Stefani's personality sings in a higher range in the first person, and the other, more confident personality sings lower in the second person. During the verses, the more nervous personality discusses her concerns about leaving No Doubt for a solo career as well as the ephemeral success of female singers in the music industry. The chorus is a boost of confidence for her and continues the song's time motif with the lines \"Look at your watch now/You're still a super hot female\". Backed by perfect octave dyads, Stefani sings a verse about her excitement for her future, and the two personalities merge into one during the coda.\n\n\"What You Waiting For?\" received positive reviews from critics. Nick Sylvester of \"Pitchfork\" gave the song a strong review, rating it four and a half stars, and labeled it \"fucking great\". The website went on to rank the song 16th on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2004. RJ Smith of \"Blender\" noted the song's new wave influence by stating that it could start a revival of Missing Persons, and Amy Linden of \"The Village Voice\" compared the \"giddy, yodeling vocals\" to those of Lene Lovich's 1981 song \"New Toy\". Jason Damas from \"PopMatters\" was mixed on the song, calling the opening \"awkward\" and the refrain \"ridiculously dumb\", but arguing that the song \"is so frivolous and stupid that it winds up being brilliant; it pretends to be nothing more than party bubblegum and achieves its artistic criteria beautifully.\" \"Slant Magazine\"s Sal Cinquemani agreed, stating that \"it's this impishness that helps make 'What You Waiting For' one of the hottest 'arrival' songs of all time\". Richard Smirke of Playlouder found the track's production \"crisp\" and \"edgy\", and Jennifer Nine of \"Dotmusic\" called the song \"itchily irresistible\". Jemma Volp-Fletcher, writing for Contactmusic.com, rated the song nine out of 10, commenting that it has \"irresistible commercial pull and a melody to die for\" and that the track \"makes the most of her unmistakable vocal and reflects that off-the-wall Stefani personality perfectly.\" Natasha Tripney from \"musicOMH\" gave the song a negative review, stating that \"it'll become one of those tracks that's irritatingly catchy—but on this initial listening, Ms Stefani's debut solo effort is just plain irritating.\"\n\nMany reviewers considered the track one of the album's highlights. \"Entertainment Weekly\" critic David Browne gave \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" a C+ rating but called the track \"one of the album's undeniable highs\". In its review of the album, Nick Sylvester of \"Pitchfork\" believed that \"we can't expect 12 more cuts as personal or urgent as debut single 'What You Waiting For'\", while naming it \"one of the best electro songs this year\". Lisa Haines of BBC Music stated that it \"stands out as the best track on the album for the way it pits storming beats against enthusiastic lyrics\" and compared the song to Goldfrapp's 2003 single \"Strict Machine\". Eric Greenwood of \"Drawer B\", who felt that the album \"fails on every level\", also commented that \"if this album had even two more songs this immediate and catchy, then I'd stick my neck out for it, but, sadly, it's the only song worth listening to.\" In 2004, \"Slant Magazine\" ranked the song number 84 in their list of \"The 100 Greatest Dance Songs of All Time\". And in 2009, \"The Daily Telegraph\" listed the song at number 82 on their list \"100 songs that defined the Noughties.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"What You Waiting For?\" debuted at number 93 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated October 16, 2004. It reached a peak of number 47 on November 27, 2004 and remained on the chart for a total of 20 weeks. The song topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart, but only had moderate success on the pop charts, reaching number 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and number 24 on the Adult Top 40. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 25, 2005. Additionally, it was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2005 Grammy Awards, but lost to Norah Jones' \"Sunrise\".\n\nElsewhere, the song's reception was stronger. In the United Kingdom, \"What You Waiting For?\" debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and remained on the chart for 15 weeks. The single performed well across most of the rest of Europe, reaching the top five in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, and Norway, and the top 10 in Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nIn Australia, \"What You Waiting For?\" debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart on November 14, 2004 and stayed there for two weeks. It remained within the top three through January 17, 2005 and dropped off the chart after 15 weeks. In 2014, the single was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The song reached number three on New Zealand's RIANZ Singles Chart and spent four months on the chart.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked to fill out a suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\".\n\nStefani portrays several characters from the books, including Alice, the White Queen, and the Red Queen, in dresses by British-Gibraltarian fashion designer John Galliano. The video frequently cuts to Stefani back in the studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world. As this transpires the song is recording itself. Stefani ultimately rediscovers her confidence, and her full awareness is transported back to the ordinary reality of the studio just as she dances in front of her four giggling Harajuku Girls. She then is presented with her bill by the consultant as a wooden chair topples to the floor.\n\nThere are four versions of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the \"Making the Video\" version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.\n\nThe music video was well received by many reviewers. Sam Bloch from Stylus Magazine referred to it as a short film, comparing it to \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\", and commented, \"I sigh with admiration and wish every video was this alive.\" The video debuted on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" on October 19, 2004 at number 11. The following month it reached the top of the chart and was there for three non-consecutive days, remaining over five weeks on the program. At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won the award for Best Art Direction and was nominated for Best Editing. At the 2005 MuchMusic Video Awards, the video was nominated for Best International Video but lost to Usher's \"Caught Up\". It won the award for Best Dressed Video at the first MTV Australia Video Music Awards, and was also nominated for Video of the Year and Best Pop Video.\n\nStuart Price (also known as Jacques Lu Cont) made the most well-known remix of the song, titled the Thin White Duke Mix, which was included on the CD single. The track, over eight minutes long, is carried by a guitar riff and occasional chimes. The remix received positive reviews from music critics. Aaron Mandel of Pitchfork labeled it \"outstanding\", and John M. Cunningham of Stylus Magazine stated that it \"endowed [the song] with a sense of grandeur\". DJ InVincible from About.com viewed the remix as \"moody and a bit hypnotic\", commenting that it is \"best suited for early-evening sets\". Armand Van Helden created two remixes, the Armand Van Helden Remix and the Armand Van Helden Dub, which use only some of the original vocals and a new bassline constructed with synthesizers and some electric guitar. Felix da Housecat created the Rude Ho Mix, which uses more bass guitar and leaves out the original background vocals by Mimi Parker until the final verse.\n\nAlex Kapranos, guitarist and lead singer of Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, wore a Gwen Stefani pin on a Members Only jacket as a tribute to \"What You Waiting For?\". In December 2005, the band performed a cover version of the song on Live Lounge, a segment of \"The Jo Whiley Show\" on BBC Radio 1. The cover includes the chorus from Billy Idol's 1983 song \"White Wedding\". In October 2006, the song was released as a part of the \"Radio 1's Live Lounge\" compilation, and the cover received mixed reviews. Jack Foley from IndieLondon called the track \"completely insane\", stating that it \"really has to be heard to be believed.\" \"The Guardian\"s Dorian Lynskey found the cover smug, adding that \"one of Alex Kapranos's eyebrows [is] raised so high that it practically vacates his head.\"\n\nWelsh indie pop singer Marina and the Diamonds covered \"What You Waiting For?\" during some of her early live performances in 2009. Mary Bellamy of Drowned in Sound referred to her debut album \"The Family Jewels\" (2010) as \"an extended album length re-write\" of \"What You Waiting For?\".\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Love.

He shares the Taiwanese professional baseball record of winning the most games in a single season (22 wins in 1993), along with .\n\nNúñez recorded one of his first at-bats during a 1988 spring training game against the Philadelphia Phillies. \"Sports Illustrated\" recounted the at bat as follows:\n\nJose Nunez, a righthanded pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays who had never batted in the pros before, stepped in against the Phillies' Kevin Gross in an exhibition game in Clearwater, Florida. Before Gross could throw a pitch, the third base ump motioned for Nunez to take off his warmup jacket. Then Nunez returned to the lefthanded-batter's box and was told by plate ump Dave Pallone that he was wearing a righty's helmet—the earflap covered his left ear rather than his right, which faced the pitcher. So Nunez turned the helmet around on his head and wore it catcher-style. No, no, said Pallone, get a lefty's helmet. No, no, said Nunez, who moved across the plate to bat righthanded.\nWhen Gross began his delivery he saw Nunez bent over the plate, looking back into catcher Lance Parrish's glove.\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Parrish.\n\"I want to see the signs\", said Nunez.\n\"O.K., what pitch do you want?\"\n\"Fastball.\"\nA fastball it was, and Nunez lined it foul. He turned to Parrish and said, \"Could you make that a changeup instead?\"\nAt that, Pallone doubled over in laughter, and Gross needed a few minutes to compose himself. Finally, on a 2-2 count, Nunez grounded out to short.\n"}

Angel. Music. Baby.\" (2004). Produced by Dr. Dre, the track features American rapper Eve, and is a remake of Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1993 song of the same name, which is in turn an adaptation of the \"Fiddler on the Roof\" song \"If I Were a Rich Man\". Stefani says the song discusses her dreams of fame and riches from the perspective of \"when she was just an Orange County girl\".\n\nThe last song to be included on the album, \"Rich Girl\" was released as the album's second single in late 2004 to mixed reviews from music critics. It was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 on most of the charts it entered. In the United States, \"Rich Girl\" was certified gold, and it received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 47th Grammy Awards.\n\nStefani and Eve had previously collaborated on the 2001 single \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\". When Stefani first began recording solo material, Eve expressed interest in working with Stefani again, saying, \"She's fly, she's tight and she is talented. It's going to be hot regardless.\" The two decided to work together again after talking in Stefani's laundry room during a party. After Stefani had co-written more than 20 songs for her solo debut, she approached Dr. Dre, who had produced for her twice before. Dre had produced \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" as well as \"Wicked Day\", a track that was excluded from No Doubt's 2001 album \"Rock Steady\".\n\nAfter playing some of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told her, \"You don't want to go back there.\" Instead of using one of the tracks, Dr. Dre instead suggested using English reggae duo Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1993 song \"Rich Girl\", which itself interpolated \"If I Were a Rich Man\" from the 1964 musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\". Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to rewrite the song, suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song.\n\nSince she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to Broadway to better understand the theme that \"even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich.\" The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill. She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because \"Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way\", but when she presented him with the song, \"he just totally tricked the track out.\"\n\n\"Rich Girl\" is a reggae song composed in the key of C minor. It is written in common time and moves at a moderate 100 beats per minute. The beat is accompanied by an alternating perfect fifth dyad and an accented piano trichord. The song is written in verse–chorus form, and its instrumentation includes the electronic keyboard, guitar, and keyboard bass. Stefani's voice ranges from G to E.\n\nThe introduction consists of the repeated use of the word \"na\". Stefani reaches her highest note of the song, E, as part of a trichord and her lowest, G, during this section. After the first chorus, Stefani discusses dreams of wealth and luxury, and she namechecks fashion designers Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano. Stefani commented that the references were not product placement but that she included them \"because I think they're rad and want to talk about them. [...] I'd give all my money to [Westwood] and buy all her clothes!\" A bridge, in which Stefani's voice is overdubbed, precedes the second chorus. During the second verse Stefani discusses her Harajuku Girls, and she then repeats the bridge. Following Eve's rap, Stefani sings the chorus and closes the song with a coda, which, like the introduction, consists of repeating the word \"na\".\n\n\"Rich Girl\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Richard Smirke of Playlouder said that it brought \"a much-needed element of diversity\" to \"L.A.M.B.\" and called it a \"potential hit single\". Krissi Murison of the \"NME\", however, described it as \"playground chant featuring a tough-girl ragga cameo from Eve.\" John Murphy from musicOMH gave it an overall positive review, calling it \"a great fun song, and far superior to some of the dross that comes out these days\", but also commented that it did not live up to \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" and found the references to the Harajuku Girls \"slightly creepy.\" Lisa Haines of BBC Music referred to the song as \"disco gold, impossibly girly and very easy to dance to.\" The song drew comparisons to the No Doubt album \"Rock Steady\", and Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine described it as \"a lite version of 'Hey Baby.'\"\n\nSeveral reviewers found it ironic that Stefani, who had already sold 26 million records with No Doubt, discussed having money in the counterfactual conditional. John Murphy from musicOMH found it \"rather strange\" for Stefani to sing the song while living off of royalties from No Doubt and her husband, post-grunge musician Gavin Rossdale. Anthony Carew from Neumu called the lyrics \"insipid\" and noted that \"the incredibly wealthy pop-starlet wonders what it'd be like to be, uh, incredibly wealthy\". \"The Orange County Register\" writer Ben Wener told Stefani that the song was disingenuous and \"absurd\", to which Stefani responded that the point of view was from before she was famous. Stefani later refused to issue credentials to the newspaper after Wener wrote that \"while posting a reported US$90 million via her clothing lines [...] she's no more 'just an Orange County girl' than Best Buy is just a shack that sells Commodore 64s\" in response to a track titled \"Orange County Girl\" from Stefani's second album \"The Sweet Escape\".\n\nThe interpolation of \"If I Were a Rich Man\" drew mixed reviews. Jason Damas, writing for \"PopMatters\", argued that the track \"turns it into an anthem of urban bling-lust\" and that its \"simple pounding piano chord makes for great percussive backing.\" Nick Sylvester from Pitchfork Media found the song corny, classifying it as \"Eve- and Dre- and Tevye-powered camp-hop.\" \"The Villager\"s Winnie MCCroy found the interpolation \"innovative\" and noted the song's take on \"the current style of shout-out rap songs.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" disagreed, stating that the interpolation was used awkwardly, and Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" called the interpolation a goof. Jason Shawhan from About.com called the track \"a dancehall/classic house teardown of 'If I Were a Rich Man'\" and added, \"If this is what Jay-Z's fudging with \"Annie\" has wrought, I say, be glad of it.\"\n\n\"Rich Girl\" debuted at number 74 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on December 25, 2004, and peaked 10 weeks later at number seven, remaining on the chart for over six months. The song did well on pop-oriented charts, reaching number three on the Pop 100, number four on the Mainstream Top 40, and number 16 on the Adult Top 40. The single had little crossover success on the urban charts, only reaching number 27 on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number 78 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. \"Rich Girl\" was helped on the Hot 100 and Pop 100 charts by its strong digital downloads, peaking at number two on the Hot Digital Songs. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 29, 2005. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration but lost to Jay-Z and Linkin Park's \"Numb/Encore\". The single was less successful in Canada, where it peaked at number 12 on the Canadian Singles Chart.\n\n\"Rich Girl\" was largely successful across Europe, reaching number two on the European Hot 100 Singles. It reached the top five in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden and the top 10 in Austria, Finland, Italy, and Switzerland. The song also charted highly in the United Kingdom, debuting at number four on March 20, 2005 for the week ending date March 26, 2005. The track was unable to reach a higher position and remained on the chart for 12 weeks.\n\nElsewhere, \"Rich Girl\" peaked within the top 20 on the majority of the charts it entered. In Australia, it debuted on February 27, 2005 at number two behind Nelly's \"Over and Over\" featuring Tim McGraw. It was unable to reach number one and dropped off the chart after 13 weeks. The single was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales in excess of 70,000 copies.\n\nThe music video for \"Rich Girl\" was directed by David LaChapelle and features a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early-1980s Vivienne Westwood advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss what they would do if they were a \"rich girl\". The video features several sequences. Stefani is first shown below the deck of a pirate ship, dancing on a table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and wenches and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, \"I need the freaks on this one.\" Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannon fire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.\n\nThe music video was a success on video channels. The video debuted at number nine on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" on December 13, 2004. It worked its way to number five, staying on the chart for a total of 13 days. The video also reached number four on MuchMusic's \"Countdown\", remaining on the chart for 16 weeks. VH1 listed \"Rich Girl\" at number 24 on its Top 40 Videos of 2005.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\"\n\n\n"}

Founded in December, 1845 or in January, 1846, the society sought to revive the ideals of the traditional Ukrainian brotherhoods and envisioned a Ukrainian national rebirth, including national independence, within a free and equal Slavic federation. It was quickly suppressed by the government in March 1847 with most of the members punished by exile or imprisonment.\n\nThe goals of the society were liberalisation of the political and social system of the Imperial Russia in accordance with the members Christian principles and the Slavophile views that gained popularity among the country's liberal intelligentsia. Created under the initiative of Nikolay Kostomarov (1818-1885), a famous historian of Russia and Ukraine, the society was named after Saints Cyril and Methodius, widely regarded as heroes for the Slavic nations celebrated for spreading Christianity and inventing the alphabet used in several Slavic languages.\n\nThe society goals included the abolition of serfdom, broad access to public education, transformation of the empire into a federation of free Slavic people with Russians being one of the equal rather than the dominant nation and, according to Mykhailo Hrushevskyi (1866-1934), the implementation of the liberal democratic principles of freedom of speech, thought and religion.\n\nMembers included Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), Panteleimon Kulish (1819-1897), Yurii Andruzky (1827 - after 1864), Vasyl Bilozersky (1825-1899), Mykola Hulak (1821-1899), Opanas Markovych, Oleksander Navrotsky, O.

After a 1961 referendum, Rwanda became a republic and received its independence in 1962.\n\nSince the monarchy was officially abolished, a court in pretence has been maintained abroad. The current titular king of Rwanda is Mwami Yuhi VI.\n\nIn the 15th century, one chiefdom managed to incorporate several of its close neighbor territories establishing the Kingdom of Rwanda after disintegration of the Bunyoro-Kitara Empire (Bachwezi Empire), which ruled over most of what is now considered Rwanda. The Hutu majority, 82–85% of the population, were mostly peasants while the kings, known as Mwamis, were generally from Tutsi. Certainly some Hutus were nobility and, equally, considerable intermingling took place.\n\nBefore the 19th century, it was believed that the Tutsis held military leadership power while the Hutus possessed healing power and agricultural skills. In this capacity, the Mwami's council of advisors (\"abiiru\") was exclusively Hutu and held significant sway. By the mid-18th century, however, the \"abiiru\" had become increasingly marginalized.\n\nThe position of Queen Mother was an important one, managing the royal household and being heavily involved in court politics. When their sons ascended to the throne, mothers would take a new name. This would be composed of \"nyira-\", meaning \"mother of\", followed by, usually, the regal name of the new king; only kings named \"Mutara\" do not follow this convention, their mothers taking the name \"Nyiramavugo\" (mother of good counsel).\n\nAs the kings centralized their power and authority, they distributed land among individuals rather than allowing it to be passed down through lineage groups, of which many hereditary chiefs had been Hutu. Most of the chiefs appointed by the Mwamis were Tutsi. The redistribution of land, enacted between 1860 and 1895 by Kigeli IV Rwabugiri, resulted in an imposed patronage system, under which appointed Tutsi chiefs demanded manual labor in return for the right of Hutus to occupy their land. This system left Hutus in a serf-like status with Tutsi chiefs as their feudal masters.\n\nUnder Mwami Rwabugiri, Rwanda became an expansionist state. Rwabugiri did not bother to assess the ethnic identities of conquered peoples and simply labeled all of them “Hutu”. The title “Hutu”, therefore, came to be a trans-ethnic identity associated with subjugation. While further disenfranchising Hutus socially and politically, this helped to solidify the idea that “Hutu” and “Tutsi” were socioeconomic, not ethnic, distinctions. In fact, one could \"kwihutura\", or “shed Hutuness”, by accumulating wealth and rising through the social hierarchy.\n\n"}

History postulates that there, a father-in-law was typically succeeded by his son-in-law. However, this again is obviously not a female succeeding a female, but a form of succession by appointment: the monarch chose his successor, and formalized that appointment by marrying the chosen man with a royal daughter, which also worked as a way to legitimize the succession.\n\nThe order of succession to the position of the Rain Queen is an example in an African culture of matrilineal primogeniture: not only is dynastic descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.\n\nThe matrilineal succession is prevalent among many sects in Asia. These include the Minangkabau culture of West Sumatra, Marumakkathayam or Aliyasantana system among Nairs and Tuluva's of India. The Undangs of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia exhibit matrilineal succession in their elective chieftaincies. \nSimilar traditions exist among the Khasi and Garo of Meghalaya, India, the Naxi of China, the Gitksan of British Columbia, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee), the Hopi, the Berbers.\n\nIn societies using matrilineal descent, the social relationship between children and their biological father tends to be different because he is not a member of their matrilineal family. For example, the man who would have the formal responsibilities that Western cultures assign to a father would be a boy's mother's brother, since he is the closest elder male kinsman.\n\nSimilarly, inheritance patterns for men in matrilineal societies often reflect the importance of the mother's brother. For example, in the Ashanti Kingdom of Central Ghana, a king traditionally passes his title and status on to his sister's son. A king's own biological son does not inherit the kingship because he is not a member of the ruling matrilineal family group. Women usually inherit status and property directly from their mothers in matrilineal societies.\n"}
{"id": "1811654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811654", "title": "Coccinia grandis", "text": "Coccinia grandis\n\nCoccinia grandis, the ivy gourd, also known as scarlet gourd, tindora and kowai fruit, is a tropical vine. It grows primarily in tropical climates and is commonly found in the southern Indian states, where it forms a part of the local cuisine. \"Coccinia grandis\" is cooked as a vegetable.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, it is grown for its edible young shoots and edible fruits.\n\n\"Coccinia grandis\" is known as\n\n\nIts native range extends from Africa to Asia, including India, the Philippines, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, eastern Papua New Guinea, and the Northern Territories, Australia. Its documented introduced range includes the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Guam, Saipan, Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu.\n\nSeeds or fragments of the vine can be relocated and lead to viable offspring. This can occur when humans transport organic debris or equipment containing \"C. grandis\". Once the ivy gourd is established, it is presumably spread by birds, rats, and other mammals. In Hawaii, the fruit may be dispersed by pigs. Long-distance dispersal is most commonly carried out by humans due to its culinary uses or by mistake.\nRegarded as very invasive and on the Hawaii State Noxious Weed List, ivy gourd can grow up to four inches per day. It grows in dense blankets, shading other plants from sunlight and highjacking nutrients, effectively killing vegetation underneath. It was introduced to Hawaii as a backyard food crop. It is sometimes tolerated along garden fences and other outdoor features because of its attractive white flowers. It has escaped to become a vigorous pest in Hawaii, Florida, Australia, and Texas. \n\nThis plant is a perennial climber with single tendrils and glabrous leaves. The leaves have 5 lobes and are 6.5–8.5 cm long and 7–8 cm wide. Female and male flowers emerge at the axils on the petiole, and have 3 stamens.\n\nBoth physical and chemical recommendations are made for control of the ivy gourd. It is very difficult to control this plant physically except by bagging fruits. Hand-harvesting normally does not kill the plant, but rather breaks the vine blankets into smaller pieces and the plant is able to re-establish when it touches the ground. These methods can make the infestation worse and further the need for more rigorous control methods. Picking the fruit and placing them in plastic bags can help decrease the seed bank present with the soil. When using chemical controls, that ivy gourd responded well to a thin-lined bark application of 100% Garlon 4 (triclopyr), leaving plants in place so as not to translocate the herbicide or spread the pest. It is applied multiple times until the vine dies. In Hawaii, several species of insect have been introduced with the purpose of being a biocontrol. Two weevils, \"Acythopeus burkhartorum\" and \"A. cocciniae\", were introduced by the Department of Agriculture to Oahu and Hawaii. African vine moths were also released onto Oahu and Maui. On the island of Maui, the \"A. cocciniae\" apparently is established and damaging leaves. The larvae feed on the plant and the adults chew holes in the leaves. The moth has yet to appear successful in its purpose. \n\nIn traditional medicine, fruits have been used to treat leprosy, fever, asthma, bronchitis, and jaundice. The fruit possesses mast cell-stabilizing, antianaphylactic, and antihistaminic potential. In Bangladesh, the roots are used to treat osteoarthritis and joint pain. A paste made of leaves is applied to the skin to treat scabies.\n\nIvy gourd extracts and other forms of the plant can be purchased online and in health food stores. These products are claimed to help regulate blood sugar levels. Some research supports that compounds in the plant inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase. Glucose-6-phosphatase is one of the key liver enzymes involved in regulating sugar metabolism. Therefore, ivy gourd is sometimes recommended for diabetic patients. Although these claims have not been supported, a fair amount of research on the medicinal properties of this plant are focusing on its use as an antioxidant, antihypoglycemic agent, immune system modulator, etc. Some countries in Asia, such as Thailand, prepare traditional tonic-like drinks for medicinal purposes.\n\nThey are best when cooked, and are often compared to bitter melon. The fruit is commonly eaten in Indian cuisine. People of Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries also consume the fruit and leaves. In Thai cuisine, it is one of the ingredients of the very popular clear soup dish \"kaeng jued tum lueng\" and some curries \"kaeng khae\" curry and kaeng lieng curry.\n\nIn India, it is eaten as a curry, by deep-frying it along with spices, stuffing it with masala and sauteing it, or boiling it first in a pressure cooker and then frying it. It is also used in \"sambar\", a vegetable and lentil-based soup. The immature fruit is also used raw, preserving its crisp texture, to make a quick fresh pickle..\n\nIvy gourd is rich in beta-carotene.\n\n"}

IV c. 73) abolished slavery throughout the British Empire. This Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom expanded the jurisdiction of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal within the British Empire, with the exception of \"the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company\", Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Saint Helena. The Act was repealed in 1997 as a part of wider rationalisation of English statute law; however, later anti-slavery legislation remains in force.\n\nIn May 1772, Lord Mansfield's judgment in the \"Somersett's Case\" emancipated a slave in England and thus helped launch the movement to abolish slavery. The case ruled that slaves could not be transported out of England against their will, but did not actually abolish slavery in England. However, many campaigners, including Granville Sharp, mistakenly believed that the Somerset case meant that slavery was unsupported by law in England and that no authority could be exercised on slaves entering English or Scottish soil. In 1785, English poet William Cowper wrote:\n\nWe have no slaves at home – Then why abroad?Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungsReceive our air, that moment they are free.They touch our country, and their shackles fall.That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud.And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,And let it circulate through every vein.\n\nBy 1783, an anti-slavery movement to abolish the slave trade throughout the Empire had begun among the British public. Spurred by an incident involving Chloe Cooley, a slave brought to Canada by an American Loyalist, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe tabled the Act Against Slavery in 1793. Passed by the local Legislative Assembly, it was the first legislation to outlaw the slave trade in a part of the British Empire.\n\nThe British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide, having previously been the world's largest slave dealers. William Wilberforce had written in his diary in 1787 that his great purpose in life was to suppress the slave trade before waging a 20-year fight on the industry.\n\nIn 1807, Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which outlawed the international slave trade, but not slavery itself. The legislation was timed to coincide with the expected prohibition from 1808 of international slave trading by the United States, Britain's chief rival in maritime commerce. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist Henry Brougham realized that trading had continued and as a new MP successfully introduced the Slave Trade Felony Act 1811 which at last made the overseas slave trade a felony act throughout the empire. The Royal Navy established the West Africa Squadron to suppress the Atlantic slave trade by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans. They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree to treaties to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to seize their slave ships.\n\nBetween 1807 and 1823, abolitionists showed little interest in abolishing slavery itself. Eric Williams presented economic data in \"Capitalism and Slavery\" to show that the slave trade itself generated only small profits compared to the much more lucrative sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and therefore slavery continued to thrive on those estates. However, from 1823 the British Caribbean sugar industry went into terminal decline, and the British parliament no longer felt they needed to protect the economic interests of the West Indian sugar planters. \n\nIn 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society was founded in London. Members included Joseph Sturge, Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce, Henry Brougham, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Elizabeth Heyrick, Mary Lloyd, Jane Smeal, Elizabeth Pease, and Anne Knight. Jamaican mixed-race campaigners such as Louis Celeste Lecesne and Richard Hill were also members of the Anti-Slavery Society.\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 1831, a large-scale slave revolt in Jamaica, known as the Baptist War, broke out. It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister Samuel Sharpe. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. The results of these inquiries contributed greatly to the abolition of slavery with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.\n\nUp until then, sugar planters from rich British islands such as the Colony of Jamaica and Barbados were able to buy rotten and pocket boroughs, and they were able to form a body of resistance to moves to abolish slavery itself. This West India Lobby, which later evolved into the West India Committee, purchased enough seats to be able to resist the overtures of abolitionists. However, The Reform Act 1832 swept away their rotten borough seats, clearing the way for a majority of members of the House of Commons to push through a law to abolish slavery itself throughout the British Empire.\n\nThe Act had its third reading in the House of Commons on 26 July 1833, three days before William Wilberforce died. It received the Royal Assent a month later, on 28 August, and came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834. In practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in the colonies. Former slaves over the age of six were redesignated as \"apprentices\", and their servitude was abolished in two stages: the first set of apprenticeships came to an end on 1 August 1838, while the final apprenticeships were scheduled to cease on 1 August 1840. The Act specifically excluded \"the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company, or to the Island of Ceylon, or to the Island of Saint Helena.\" The exceptions were eliminated in 1843.\n\nThe Act provided for payments to slave-owners. The amount of money to be spent on the payments was set at \"the Sum of Twenty Million Pounds Sterling\". Under the terms of the Act, the British government raised £20 million (£16.5 billion in 2013 pounds, when calculated as wage values) to pay out for the loss of the slaves as business assets to the registered owners of the freed slaves. In 1833, £20 million amounted to 40% of the Treasury's annual income or approximately 5% of the British GDP (5% of the British GDP in 2016 was around £100 billion). To finance the payments, the British government had to take on a £15 million loan, finalised on 3 August 1835, with banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild and his brother-in-law Moses Montefiore. The money was not paid back until 2015. \n\nHalf of the money went to slave-owning families in the Caribbean and Africa, while the other half went to absentee owners living in Britain. The names listed in the returns for slave owner payments show that ownership was spread over many hundreds of British families, many of them (though not all) of high social standing. For example, Henry Phillpotts (then the Bishop of Exeter), with three others (as trustees and executors of the will of John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley), was paid £12,700 for 665 slaves in the West Indies, whilst Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood received £26,309 for 2,554 slaves on 6 plantations. The majority of men and women who were paid under the 1833 Abolition Act are listed in a Parliamentary Return, entitled Slavery Abolition Act, which is an account of all moneys awarded by the Commissioners of Slave Compensation in the \"Parliamentary Papers\" 1837–8 (215) vol. 48.\n\nOn 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly people being addressed by the Governor at Government House in Port of Spain, Trinidad, about the new laws, began chanting: \"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans\" (\"Not six years. No six years\"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and \"de facto\" freedom was achieved. Full emancipation for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838.\n\nAs a notable exception to the rest of the British Empire, the Act did not extend to any of the Territories administered by the East India Company, including the islands of Ceylon, and Saint Helena. in which the Company had been independently regulating, and in part prohibiting the slave trade since 1774; with regulations prohibiting enslavement, the sale without a written deed, and the transport of slaves into Company territory prohibited over the period. The Indian Slavery Act of 1843 went on to prohibit Company employees from owning, or dealing in slaves, along with granting limited protection under the law, that included the ability for a slave to own, transfer or inherit property, notionally benefitting the 8 to 10 million that were estimated to exist in Company territory, to quote Rev. Malcom:\nA successor organisation to the Anti-Slavery Society was formed in London in 1839, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, which worked to outlaw slavery worldwide. The world's oldest international human rights organisation, it continues today as Anti-Slavery International.\n\nIt is believed that after 1833 clandestine slave-trading continued within the British Empire; in 1854 Nathaniel Isaacs, owner of the island of Matakong off the coast of Sierra Leone was accused of slave-trading by the governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Arthur Kennedy. Papers relating to the charges were lost when the \"Forerunner\" was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution.\n\nIn Australia, blackbirding and the holding of indigenous workers' pay \"in trust\" continued, in some instances into the 1970s.\n\nModern slavery, both in the form of human trafficking and people imprisoned for forced or compulsory labour, continues to this day.\n\nThe Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was repealed in its entirety by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1998. The repeal has not made slavery legal again, with sections of the Slave Trade Act 1824, Slave Trade Act 1843 and Slave Trade Act 1873 continuing in force. In its place the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates into British Law Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits the holding of persons as slaves.\n\nAva DuVernay was commissioned by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. This film, \"August 28: A Day in the Life of a People\", tells of six significant events in African-American history that happened on the same date, August 28. Events depicted include (among others) William IV's royal assent to the Slavery Abolition Act.\n\n\n\n"}

He acquired the nickname \"Red Robert\", as even his moderate liberal politics caused concern for the conservative members of the Eton school of governors. His predecessor, Claude Aurelius Elliott was appointed provost and in his capacity as chair of the board of governors, living next door to Birley, he was able to keep an eye on Robert.\n\nBirley was educated at Rugby and Balliol. He began his career as a history master at Eton in 1926 and in 1935 was appointed as headmaster of Charterhouse. During this time, he was the principal author of the Fleming Report of 1944 on the relationship between the public schools and mainstream education.\n\nIn 1947, after the Second World War, Birley became Educational Advisor to the Control Commission in the British Zone in Germany, responsible for educational reconstruction, and played an important role in the rewriting of Nazi history textbooks, removing their racist bent. From 1947 to 1949 he gave important support to Lilo Milchsack who formed the Anglo-German Association to improve post-war relations. Birley returned to support these efforts after he left Germany in 1949.\n\nIn 1949, Birley was appointed Head Master of Eton, where he remained until 1963. Also in 1949, he was invited by the BBC to deliver the annual Reith Lectures. The radio broadcasts were titled \"Britain in Europe: Reflections on the Development of a European Society\".\n\nBirley considered the history and future impact of Britain's increasing involvement with Europe. He subsequently became a visiting Professor of education at Witwatersrand University, South Africa from 1964 to 1967. In 1967 he was appointed Professor and Head of Department of Social Science and Humanities at City University a post he held until 1971. He wrote and lectured extensively on education, apartheid and human rights issues and the Robert Birley memorial lectures are a tribute to his contributions.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1982, Birley was professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London. He was President of the Bibliographical Society from 1979 to 1980.\n\nBirley's biography, \"Red Robert: a life of Robert Birley\", by Arthur Hearnden, appeared in 1984. A collection of his writings, \"History and Idealism: Essays, Lectures, Sermons and Letters of Robert Birley\", appeared in 1990, edited by his son-in-law, Brian Rees.\n\nHis grandfather, Arthur Birley (1834–1912), was the brother of Hugh Birley, who served as Member of Parliament for Manchester from 1868 to 1883.\n\n\n"}

The order is based on that in the source document. For HTML without any style, this method usually works as the spatial location of the element is in the same order of the source document. However, with the introduction of style via presentational attributes or stylesheets such as CSS, this type of navigation is being used less often. Spatial navigation uses the arrow keys (with one or more modifier key held) to navigate on the \"2D plane\" of the interface. For example, pressing the \"up\" arrow key will focus on the closest focusable element on the top (relative to the current element). In many cases, this could save many key presses.\n\nThis accessibility feature is available in a number of applications, e.g. Opera's web browser. For Opera users, this allows a faster way to \"jump\" to different areas in long web pages or articles without manually scrolling and scanning with their eyes. Some examples, as noted above, include the Tab key to jump to the next input field, but also Shift + arrow keys (up, down, right, left) to jump to various links and text headers. \n\nDoug Turner (Mozilla), the Minimo lead developer, has created a couple of special Mozilla Firefox builds with this feature. Eventually, this may build as a default part of Firefox.\n\nNightly builds of WebKit (the layout engine used by Apple Safari and Google Chrome, among others) now have support for spatial navigation.\n\nIn games such navigation is represented by (for example) camera-relative movement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811676", "title": "Bagshot", "text": "Bagshot\n\nBagshot is a large village in the southeast of England. It is situated in the northwest corner of Surrey within the county's Surrey Heath council district, close to the border with Berkshire, and is also in the diocese of Guildford. In the past, Bagshot served as an important staging post between London, Southampton and the West Country. Evidence of this can be seen in some of the original coaching inns that are still there today.\n\nThe village is situated southwest of London, adjacent to junction 3 of the M3 motorway and is split in half by the A30 road, midway between Camberley and Sunningdale. Much of the surrounding land is owned by the Ministry of Defence. The area is in the Green Belt that surrounds London. It is served by Bagshot railway station.\n\nThe place-name 'Bagshot' is first attested in the Pipe Rolls of 1165, where it appears as \"Bagsheta\". It was the name of a wood, and may have meant 'Bacga's wood'.\n\nRecent excavations have shown that settlements of Bagshot date back as far as pre-Roman, before these excavations it was thought that the earliest settlements in Bagshot were late Saxon. Late Bronze Age settlements have been identified in the area, and iron smelting appears to have been a major 'industry' in the locality. Bagshot at one time included a Royal forest. It had a Royal hunting lodge certainly through Stuart and Tudor times, now called Bagshot Park, which is now the residence of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\nIn Elizabethan times (late 16th century) Bagshot prospered due to its position on the main London to the West Country road (The Great South West Road, now classified as the A30). As with many villages on main coaching routes, Bagshot developed services, inns for the stagecoach passengers, and stables to provide the coaches with fresh horses. Ann Nelson's \"Exeter Telegraph\" would stop for 20 minutes at Bagshot on its 17 hour journey to Devon.\n\nThe prosperity of the Great South West Road created its share of highwaymen, one of the most notorious being William Davis, a local farmer who lived near what is known locally as the Jolly Farmer roundabout in Camberley. He was eventually caught at the White Hart Inn in Bagshot and later was hanged at the gallows in Gibbets Lane in Camberley. Not one to avoid suspicion he always paid his debts in gold! It was after him that the pub was called the Golden Farmer. The Golden Farmer (now Jolly Farmer), was eventually sold to American Golf Discount Store, who still use the old building.\n\nBagshot has five churches: Church of England (St. Anne's); Roman Catholic (Christ the King); Methodist, Evangelical (Brook Church) and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nSt Anne's Church is 120 years old and was built in a Gothic Revival style under the patronage of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught who lived in the nearby Bagshot Park. It is a building in red brick with stone detail under a slate roof. There is a bell tower with a peal of eight bells. It is a grade II listed building and is situated in a conservation area.\n\nBagshot has two multi-purpose sports fields and a cricket field.\n\nCurley Park Rangers, the youth football club, meet regularly and play on pitches in both Lightwater and Bagshot. The CPR clubhouse is located at the Bagshot pitch.\n\nWhite Hart Royals, the football team of the White Hart pub in Bagshot village, compete in the Camberley & District Sunday Football League.\n\nBagshot Cricket Club runs a number of adult and under 16 teams and complete in the Thames Valley League, the Three Counties League and the West Surrey Youth League.\n\nBagshot Tennis Club has four floodlit courts and fields teams in the Woking League.\n\nSwinley Forest, which borders Bagshot to the north, provides some of the best mountain biking in South-East England, with many off-road 'single-track' trails available as well as plenty of fire roads. Mountain biking is permitted with a permit and walking is free. Swinley Woods was considered as a venue for the mountain biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nOther clubs and organisations include Bagshot Concert Band, the Surrey Heath Archaeology and Heritage Trust, Bagshot Gymnastics Club, Camberley and Bagshot Metal Detecting Club and local branches of the Scouts, Royal Air Forces Association, Women's Institute and Camberley Rifle & Pistol Club. It is also a short distance from The National Clay Shooting Centre and the Bisley shooting ranges.\n\nBagshot library is situated on the High Street and in addition to the usual library services provides Story and 'Rhymetimes' for the local toddler community.\n\nLightwater Country Park is accessible by crossing the M3 footbridge.\n\nPennyhill Park Hotel located at the far western edge of Bagshot is where the England rugby team train. Bagshot Park, home of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex is located on the northern edge of the town. The A30 leaving Bagshot to the southwest for Camberley has a large roundabout on it called the Jolly Farmer after a public house that used to stand in its centre, now used as a Golfing Store.\n\nThe local borough, Surrey Heath, is mainly a Conservative area and it has held a Conservative council for the past 50 years. Bagshot itself is, however, represented by two Liberal Democrat and one Conservative borough councillors.\n\nBagshot is working (2009/2010) on a Village Plan. The Bagshot Village Plan aims to pull together the people of Bagshot's collected hopes and concerns for the community and to set out a plan for making Bagshot an even better place to live and work.\n\nSome large companies are based in Bagshot, including Big Yellow Self Storage, and the Wooldridge Group.\n\n"}

Lee III, great-granddaughter of Lt. Ralph Izard; and commissioned 15 May 1943, Commander Earl K. Van Swearingen in command.\n\nAfter shakedown interrupted by a search for a German U-boat off the coast of The Carolinas, \"Izard\" departed Norfolk 14 September 1943 and sailed for Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal Zone and San Diego. Arriving Pearl Harbor 4 October she spent the next 6 weeks training and standing plane guard duty.\n\nAs the Pacific Fleet started its mighty sweep across Micronesia \"Izard\" sortied 10 November 1943 from Pearl Harbor with Rear Admiral Charles Alan Pownall's Carrier Force (TF-50) for the Gilbert Islands operations, and for the next month provided air, surface and antisubmarine protection for Makin Island.\n\nAfter taking part in the bombardment of Nauru Island 8 December 1943 \"Izard\" retired to Havannah Harbor, Efate. Here she trained and rehearsed for the fleet's next target—the Marshall Islands. \"Izard\" sortied from Funafuti Harbor, Ellice Island, 23 January 1944 with Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman's Carrier Task Group to provide air cover for the assault and capture of Kwajalein. At 04:40 29 January the carriers launched their first strikes toward Kwajalein. By that afternoon the fleet had delivered many devastating blows on the enemy. By 4 February \"Izard\" had entered Majuro Atoll, recently captured from the Japanese, and dropped anchor. Here she joined Admiral Raymond Spruance's Truk Striking Force and Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 58/38) for strikes on Truk (17–18 February 1944). The first strike was launched at 06:42 17 February and after 2 days the carrier planes had destroyed auxiliary cruisers \"Aikoku Maru\" and \"Eiyosumi Maru\"; destroyer \"Fumizuki\"; submarine tenders \"Rio de Janeiro Maru\" and \"Heian Maru\"; aircraft ferry \"Fujikawa Maru\", 6 tankers and 17 more marus; total tonnage about 200,000. Planes from \"Enterprise\" (CV-6) also sunk destroyers \"Oite\" and \"Agano\". On the first day of the strikes while Admiral Mitscher's planes were at work, Admiral Spruance's group, including \"Izard\", conducted a round-the-atoll search to catch escaping vessels. They sunk light cruiser \"Katori\", destroyer \"Maikaze\", and sub chaser \"SC-24\". After 18 February Truk lost its usefulness as a fleet anchorage or advanced naval base for the Japanese. In addition, the 250 to 275 planes destroyed or damaged was a severe blow to the Japanese air force.\n\n\"Izard\" screened the carriers launching strikes in the Tinian-Saipan area 22 February, retiring to Majuro the 26th and Pearl in mid-March. From March through August she operated in support of the 5th Fleet operations in New Guinea and the Marianas. \"Izard\" was part of the screen for Admiral J.J. \"Jocko\" Clark's Carrier Task Group TG 58.1 during the Battle of the Philippine Sea (19–20 June 1944) which broke the enemy's once-mighty naval air arm.\n\n\"Izard\" continued in support of fast carriers launching strike after strike against the enemy. On 4 July 1944 it was in a group of three cruisers and four destroyers that bombarded the airfield at Iwo Jima. During the first part of October she joined Admiral John S. McCain's task group for strikes on Okinawa and Formosa. During the following months she supported the Leyte operation and participated in the Battle of Lingayen Gulf. There she was next to the \"Columbia\" (CL-56) when the \"Columbia\" was hit by a kamikaze. At one point, she sailed through the eyewall of a Pacific storm that had 50 knot winds. In February 1945 she was supposed to head for refitting, but another ship needed replacement as part of the Iwo Jima attack. She sailed with one other ship to Iwo Jima, arrived on the second day of the invasion, and was assigned duty during the Battle of Iwo Jima rendering fire support, screening, and radar picket duty until 27 March. She fired 3,600 five inch rounds at Iwo Jima during the battle, firing from South of the island.\n\n\"Izard\" steamed for Eniwetok 28 March arriving 2 April. Joining a convoy she steamed east, reaching Pearl Harbor on the day of FDR's death, hearing the news as she was sailing in the channel at Pearl on her arrival. She then quickly resumed sailing and arrived at Bremerton for refitting on 20 April 1945. \"Izard\" sailed for Pearl Harbor 30 June and in August joined the Northern Pacific Force at Adak, Alaska. The last of August, the \"Izard\" sailed for Honshū, Japan, and after the war continued to operate in northern Japan, liberating prisoners-of-war and demobilizing Japanese army and navy units until 15 November.\n\n\"Izard\" returned to Seattle the last of November and 2 April 1946 steamed to San Diego. \"Izard\" decommissioned there 31 May 1946 and joined the Reserve Fleet. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 1 May 1968, was sold 2 April 1970 and broken up for scrap.\n\n\"Izard\" received 10 battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}
{"id": "1811682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811682", "title": "John Zachary Young", "text": "John Zachary Young\n\nJohn Zachary Young FRS (18 March 1907 – 4 July 1997), generally known as \"JZ\" or \"JZY\", was an English zoologist and neurophysiologist, described as \"one of the most influential biologists of the 20th century\".\n\nYoung went to school at Marlborough College. In 1928, he received a first class honours degree in zoology from Magdalen College, Oxford. On Oct. 12, 1942, Young spoke at the Socratic Club in Oxford on the topic \"Purpose and Design in Nature\" as part of the series of talks and debates led by C. S. Lewis. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1945 and served as Professor of Anatomy at University College London from then until 1974. The following year, he became a Professor Emeritus and proposed a degree programme in the Human Sciences.\n\nAmong his honors are a Linnean Medal for zoology from the Linnean Society of London, awarded in 1973. He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath in 1974. The chair of the Anatomy Department at University College London is named the J. Z. Young Chair in his honour. For many years, Young spent the summer experimenting season at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples. In 1991, the city awarded him honorary citizenship, and the President of the Stazione Zoologica awarded him its Gold Medal. That year he was also invited by the Italian Biological Society to give an anniversary lecture, as the society's oldest living member; for this lecture, Young picked the same subject he had talked about 63 years earlier, in 1928.\n\nIn 1981, Young became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.\n\nYoung revered the brother of his great-great- grandfather, Richard, the English scientist and Egyptologist Thomas Young, M.D., F.R.S. (1773–1829).\n\nMost of Young's scientific research was on the nervous system. He discovered the squid giant axon and the corresponding squid giant synapse. His work in the 1930s on signal transmission in, and the fibre structure of, nerves inspired the work of Sir Andrew Huxley and Sir Alan Hodgkin for which they received a Nobel prize.\n\nDuring World War II, responding to the large number of nerve injuries sustained by soldiers in combat and drawing on his work in comparative anatomy and the regrowth of damaged nerves in squids and octopuses, Young set up a unit at the University of Oxford to study nerve regeneration in mammals. His team investigated the biochemical conditions which control nerve fibre growth and also sought ways to accelerate the repair of peripheral nerves severed by injury. Working with Peter Medawar, Young found a way to rejoin small peripheral nerves using a \"glue\" of plasma. This method was eventually modified and used in surgery.\n\nAfter WWII, Young's research interests turned to investigating the central nervous system and the functions of the brain. He discussed and corresponded with the mathematician Alan Turing on brain cells, memory, pattern recognition, and embryology, from 1949.\n\nIn 1950, Young was invited by the BBC to deliver the Reith Lectures. In his series of eight radio broadcasts, titled \" Doubt and Certainty in Science\", he introduced the BBC audience to the themes of his research, exploring the function of the brain and the then-current scientific methods used to increase understanding of it.\n\nHowever, Young is probably best remembered for his two textbooks, \"The Life of Vertebrates\" and \"The Life of Mammals\". He was President of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) from 1976 to 1986. His personal research library is held in the National Marine Biological Library at the MBA.\n\nYoung was born in Mangotsfield near Bristol. After moving to London to take up his position at University College London, he lived first in Chelsea then moved to Camden Town in 1962.

Some recipes also add flour, such as corn flour, oats flour or cassava flour. It is typical of the Brazilian Caipira cuisine and most present in the countryside of southeastern states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, being either manufactured or home-made. It is also very common during the Festa Junina, an annual festivity that celebrates the caipira lifestyle. It is known for its distinct dry texture and sweet taste, and is one of the most beloved Brazilian candies.\n\nPaçoca in its present form was invented during the Colonial Brazil Period, but Native Brazilian peoples had recipes that mixed cassava flour with other ingredients prior to colonization. Those recipes were modified by the settlers, creating the current combination that uses sugar.\n\nThe name \"paçoca\" comes from the Tupi word \"posok\" (pronounced /pɔsɔk/) which means \"to crumble\" or \"to shatter,\" and is shared with the salty Paçoca dish. Both are a mix of cassava flour with other ingredients: peanut and sugar in the case of the sweet, and carne-de-sol (\"sun-dried-beef\") for the salty dish. Both dishes seem to have originated from the same Native Brazilian customs, but have grown to be completely different products\n\nThe traditional artisanal process of making paçoca involves first roasting the peanuts, then grinding all the ingredients together using a traditional Mortar (\"pilão\"). In more modern manufacturing techniques, instead of a mortar, industrial blenders are used, and the Paçocas are later pressed into many shapes, most commonly square or cork shapes.\n\nSome companies have created variations from the traditional Paçoca recipe, which include a diet version, with no sugar added, and a version with a concentration of peanuts.\n\n"}

Nelson and launched in 1923 and mainly intended for killing flies and mosquitoes, was mineral oil based and manufactured by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey before the company, now part of ExxonMobil, renamed itself first Esso and later Exxon. The Esso formulation contained 5% DDT in the late 1940s and early 1950s, before the negative environmental impact of DDT was widely understood. Later marketed as \"FLIT MLO,\" it has since been discontinued. A hand-operated device called a Flit gun was commonly used to perform the spraying.\n\nThe Flit brand name has been reused for another insecticide product, with the primary active ingredient of permethrin, marketed by Clarke Mosquito Control. The current product is most often used to control adult mosquitoes. Spraying it into the air kills adult mosquitoes that are present and then by settling onto surfaces it kills mosquitoes that may later land.\n\nIn 1928, Flit, then marketed by a newly formed subsidiary of Jersey Standard, Stanco Incorporated, became the subject of a very successful long running advertising campaign. Theodor Seuss Geisel created the artwork for this campaign, years before he started writing the children's books that made him famous as Dr. Seuss. The ads typically showed people threatened by whimsical, menacing insect-like creatures that would look familiar to fans of Dr. Seuss's later work and contained the tagline \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" This advertising campaign continued for 17 years and made \"Quick, Henry, the Flit!\" a popular catchphrase in the United States.\n\nAccording to one source, some raw material (possibly the solvent) used for the production of FLIT was similar to that used for LF-1A fuel for the Lockheed U-2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, causing a nationwide shortage of bug spray in 1955.

His analysis of the teaching of handwriting to students, both in school by professional teachers, and at home by parents has several strong pedagogical theories in its intellectual background. Along with his analysis Pitman created a system of spelling that allows students to spell as words are pronounced (according to an alternative orthography for an English-language teaching alphabet). His major work on this topic is \"Alphabets and Reading: The Initial Teaching Alphabet\" (1965).\n\nHis thorough work has been adapted for several other uses: teaching English as a second language to adults for pronunciation and handwriting purposes, use on the Internet by alternative orthographers of English (an alternative most realisable by use of crossover systems adapted to the standard keyboard), and aesthetic uses where the writer wants to play at the conjunction of signs or symbols, and alphabet-based writing. This latter use gives rise to an aesthetics and poetics of its own, as in the Owlbirdbet Crossover system adapted to the standard keyboard, where it is more widely accessible to Internet users.\nOverall, the Pitman initial teaching alphabet (ita) points the way to the needed overall reform of English spelling, such as the Dutch accomplished in regard the writing of their own tongue some two decades ago.\n\nPitman was the son of Ernest Pitman and grandson of Sir Isaac Pitman, who developed the most widely used system of shorthand, known now as Pitman Shorthand. James Pitman was to become chairman and joint managing director of the Pitman Press and Pitman Publishing.\n\nPitman was educated at Summer Fields School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He excelled in athletics, won the Public Schools middleweight boxing championship of 1919 and gained his 'blue' at Oxford University in rugby union which he also played for England against Scotland.\n\nIn 1934 he became chairman of Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, a post he held until 1966. He was a director of Boots Pure Drug, Bovril and the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society. He wrote several books on the teaching of English and is best known as the inventor of the Initial Teaching Alphabet. The educational institutes with which he was involved, often as president or chairman, included the British and Foreign School Society, the British Association for Commercial and Industrial Education, the National Association for the Advancement of Education for Commerce, the Committee of the Simplified Spelling Society and the Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation.\n\nDuring World War II Pitman was a Squadron Leader in the RAFVR. He became a Director of the Bank of England in 1941 until after 1945 and was Director of Organization and Methods at HM Treasury 1943–5.\n\nAt the 1945 general election, Pitman was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath. In the House of Commons, he championed spelling reform, working with the Labour MP, Mont Follick, to promote the cause of the Simplified Spelling Society.\nPitman retired from Parliament in 1964. He continued to serve on several company boards. He also served as Chairman of the Management Committee of the University of London Institute of Education. He was Pro-Chancellor of the University of Bath 1972–81 and ensured that the Pitman papers would reside with the University.

The original church was located at the southwest corner of Church Street and Adelaide Street East. It was built by John Ewart. After the 1843 split of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, a portion of the congregation supportive of the Free Church Movement left St. Andrew's the following summer and founded Knox Presbyterian, along with another group led by the Rev. James Harris that had been separate since 1834.\n\nThe original St Andrew's building eventually proved too small, and the church moved to its current location on the southeast corner of King and Simcoe Streets (one block west of University Avenue and the St. Andrew subway station which got its name from the church) on February 13, 1876. This westward move caused some controversy, and the church split over the issue. One group (62 of 403 members) continued in the old church, which became known as Old St. Andrew's. This group moved in 1878 to a new building located on nearby Jarvis Street. It continued until 1951 when Old St. Andrew's United Church joined with Westminster (formerly Yorkville Presbyterian) - Central (formerly Methodist) to become St. Andrew's United at 117 Bloor Street East. The Old St. Andrew's building was sold to another denomination and became St. Andrew's Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nThe main congregation moved to the new Romanesque Revival architecture church that became known as New St. Andrew's. This building was designed by noted Toronto architect W. G. Storm and the church was the central Presbyterian church in Toronto, with an addition and renovation in 1906. It became especially well known under the ministry of renowned orator Rev. D. J. Macdonnell (1870-1896) who pushed the church towards an active social role, and was the centre of a heresy trial in 1876 (a minor bump in the recently formed Presbyterian Church in Canada). As such, the intersection of King and Simcoe was popularly said to represent one of the four parts of Toronto society, namely \"Salvation\". The others were: \"Legislation\", the Lieutenant-Governor's Residence; \"Education\", the original home of Upper Canada College; and \"damnation\", a tavern.\n\nThe congregation was one of the most active in opposition to the union that saw the majority of Canadian Presbyterian churches join the United Church of Canada in 1925. The St. Andrew's congregation, under the leadership of Rev. Dr. Stuart C. Parker voted 94% (19-733) against joining the new church. It was at St. Andrew's that representatives of the remaining Presbyterian churches from across Canada met for a \"Congress\", as well as the General Assembly of the Continuing Presbyterian Church in June 1925. Around this time, \"73 Simcoe Street\" became used the postal address for the anti-Church Union group, the Presbyterian Church Association.\n\nLater in the 20th century, the church's downtown location presented a challenge to St. Andrew's, since the area had become largely industrial and later one of the poorest in the city. Increasingly, the church patrons were living further north. There were thus many discussions of again moving the church, but each time the congregation voted to remain put.\n\nEventually, the revival of the downtown core in the 1970s and 1980s began with the opening of the St. Andrew Subway Station at nearby University Avenue in 1963. Further redevelopment of the area, including the addition of Roy Thomson Hall on the southwest corner of Simcoe and King Streets, transformed the neighbourhood, and the church is again prospering. After acquiring air rights from new buildings in the area, there was an extensive rebuilding at the south end, including construction of a new condominium tower in which the congregation retained the first three floors.\n\nThe property (consisting of the manse and the church building) is designated under part IV of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" since August 10, 1981. There is also a Heritage Easement on the property since July 1981. The designation notes that it was designed by William Storm in 1875 with an alteration in 1907 by Curry, Sproat & Rolph.\n\nThe congregation has taken leadership in ministry to the poor, with \"Out of the Cold\", coordinated by famous author Stevie Cameron, and a Boarding Homes Ministry, as well as involvement with the Presbyterian Church in Canada's Evangel Hall.\n\nThe congregation also maintains ties with its Scottish roots. In March 2005, to celebrate their 175th Anniversary as a congregation, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, Dr. Alison Elliot, was involved as their Anniversary Speaker. The 48th Highlanders Regiment has a strong link with the congregation, and the regiment's museum is located in the basement of the church. The museum includes regimental uniforms, medals, photographs, weapons and other artifacts. Founded in 1959, the museum opened in its current location in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was given a life peerage on 10 May 1962.\n\nLord Franks was often called upon by the government of the day to chair important inquiries, and he is best known for his report in the aftermath of the Falklands War which ultimately exonerated the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her government from charges of having failed to heed warning signals of an Argentine invasion.\n\nFranks was educated at Bristol Grammar School and Queen's College, Oxford. He became an Oxford academic, and Provost of Worcester College. He was a moral philosopher by training, serving as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow between 1936 and 1946.\n\nOliver Shewell Franks married Barbara Tanner in 1931. She gave birth to two daughters and died in 1987.\n\nAt the beginning of the war he was employed by the Ministry of Supply, where he rose to become Permanent Secretary by 1945. During the war he achieved fame by replacing the supplies after Dunkirk, and also replaced supplies from losses in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war he became Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Supply, and was involved in a lecture entitled \"Central Planning and Control in War and Peace\".\n\nFranks was a Liberal and a great supporter of Clement Attlee. He was admired by Ernest Bevin. He had frequent conversations with Winston Churchill and Jawaharlal Nehru. After a spell as Provost of his \"alma mater\", Queen's College (1946-8), he was summoned by Bevin in 1947 to head the British delegation at the European discussions about George Marshall's proposals of aid. He helped found NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), and became chairman of the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation. He also had the dubious distinction of having on his staff at various times Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Duart Maclean.\n\nHe was made ambassador to the United States in 1948. According to an urban legend there was one minor embarrassment early in his term. In 1948, a Washington radio station contacted ambassadors in the US capital, asking what each most wished for Christmas. The French ambassador said he would like to see peace throughout the world. The Russian ambassador wanted freedom for all people enslaved by imperialism. Sir Oliver Franks mistook the request, saying: \"Well, it’s very kind of you to ask. I’d quite like a box of crystallised fruit.\"\n\nWhen he returned to England from Washington he took up the post of Chairman of Lloyds Bank which he held only from 1954 to 1962, although he remained a director until 1975. Between 1960 and 1962 he was also chairman of Friends Provident. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. From 1962 to 1976 he was Provost of Worcester College, Oxford.\n\nFranks presented the BBC Reith Lectures in 1954. In his series of six broadcasts, titled \"Britain and the Tide of World Affairs\", he explored the state of postwar politics, and considered Britain's changing political relationships with the rest of the world. In 1960 he came a close second to Harold Macmillan in the election of the Chancellor of Oxford University. There were 1,697 votes for Macmillan, and 1,607 votes for Franks. He was the chairman of a Commission of Inquiry at the University of Oxford in 1964–65.

Its name comes from \"Lugdunum\", the Latin name for Lyon, France, where the organism was first isolated.\n\nColonies of \"S. lugdunensis\" are usually hemolytic, sticky, yellow or tan, and about 2–4 mm in diameter after a 48-hour incubation. They also can have a characteristic sweet, hay-like odor. \"S. lugdunensis\" may produce a bound coagulase (that is, the enzyme is bound to the cells), a property it shares with \"S. aureus\", but unlike \"S. aureus\", it does not produce a free coagulase. In the laboratory, it can give a positive slide-coagulase test but a negative tube-coagulase test. It is fairly easy to identify because, unlike the great majority of staphylococci, it decarboxylates ornithine and is positive for pyrrolidonyl arylamidase.\n\nIn the past, it was frequently misidentified as \"S. hominis\", \"S. aureus\", or other species. It occurs as a commensal on human skin, but has been recorded as a cause of serious human infections, such as osteomyelitis, arthritis, septicaemia, wound infections, and aggressive endocarditis.\n\n\"S. lugdunensis\" is generally very susceptible to antistaphylococcal antibiotics, but increasing penicillin resistance has been reported.\n\nAcute postoperative endophthalmitis caused by \"S. lugdunensis\" is infrequently reported in clinical studies. Five cases of acute postcataract surgery endophthalmitis were taken from a multicenter prospective study conducted in four university-affiliated hospitals in France (2004 to 2005). These cases were characterized by severe ocular inflammation occurring with a mean delay of 7.6 days after cataract surgery, severe visual loss (hand motions or less in three cases), and dense infiltration of the vitreous. Each of these patients was initially treated by using a standard protocol with intravitreal (vancomycin and ceftazidime), systemic, and topical antibiotics. Given the severity of the endophthalmitis, though bacteria were sensitive to intravitreal antibiotics, pars plana vitrectomy was needed in four cases. The final visual prognosis was complicated by severe retinal detachment in three cases. The microbiological diagnosis was reached by using conventional cultures with specific biochemical tests and eubacterial PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing.\n\n\"S. lugdunensis\" has been associated with a wide variety of infections, including cardiovascular infections (severe native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, myocarditis, and infected myxoma), empyema, osteomyelitis and prosthetic/native joints infections, skin and soft-tissue infections (furuncles, cellulitis, and abscesses), central nervous infections, peritonitis, endocephalitis, and urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\n"}

At one time, La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège were run on successive days as \"Le Weekend Ardennais\" (both races are organised by Amaury Sport Organisation). Only seven riders have achieved the \"Ardennes double\" by winning both races in the same year: Alejandro Valverde three times (in 2006, 2015 and 2017), Ferdi Kubler twice (in 1951 and 1952), Stan Ockers (1955), Eddy Merckx (1972), Moreno Argentin (1991) Davide Rebellin (2004) and Philippe Gilbert (2011).\n\nLa Flèche Wallonne was created to boost the sales of a newspaper \"Les Sports\" during the 1930s and was first run in 1936. While perhaps not as revered as one of the Classic 'Monuments', the race is widely regarded as a Classic, and featured on the UCI Road World Cup and UCI ProTour. It became part of the UCI World Ranking calendar in 2009.\n\nLike many cycle race events, the course has altered considerably over the years, both in route and length. The event was first run on roads from Tournai to Liège (growing from 236 km to 300 km — its longest ever distance — in 1938), after which Mons became the starting point. From 1948, the race started at Charleroi; from 1960 the event ran in the opposite direction, starting at Liège and finishing at Charleroi (or, from 1965, Marcinelle). Some years have seen the event start and finish in the same place: Verviers (1974–1978) or Huy (1983–1985). From 1986, the race started in Spa and finished in Huy. Since 1990, the race distance has not exceeded 210 km.\n\nSince its inception, it has been held every year except 1940, due to World War 2, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nToday, the event starts in Charleroi and heads east to Huy, where the riders do three laps of a tough circuit including the steep Mur de Huy (The wall of Huy) climb, with several sections steeper than 15% and up to 26% on one section. The finish is at the top of the Mur after the third ascent.\n\nAlejandro Valverde has won the race a record five times. Four riders have won the race three times, two of them Belgians, and two Italians.

{"id": "1811772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811772", "title": "Atoms for Peace", "text": "Atoms for Peace\n\n\"Atoms for Peace\" was the title of a speech delivered by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the UN General Assembly in New York City on December 8, 1953.\nThe United States then launched an \"Atoms for Peace\" program that supplied equipment and information to schools, hospitals, and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world. The first nuclear reactors in Iran, Israel and Pakistan were built under the program by American Machine and Foundry, a company more commonly known as a major manufacturer of bowling equipment.\n\nThe speech was part of a carefully orchestrated media campaign, called \"Operation Candor\", to enlighten the American public on the risks and hopes of a nuclear future. It was a propaganda component of the Cold War strategy of containment. Eisenhower's speech opened a media campaign that would last for years and that aimed at \"emotion management,\" balancing fears of continuing nuclear armament with promises of peaceful use of uranium in future nuclear reactors. The speech was a tipping point for international focus on peaceful uses of atomic energy, even during the early stages of the Cold War. Eisenhower, with some influence from J. Robert Oppenheimer, may have been attempting to convey a spirit of comfort to a terrified world after the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and of the nuclear tests of the early 1950s.\n\nIt presented an ostensible antithesis to brinkmanship, the international intrigue that subsequently kept the world at the edge of war.\nHowever, recent historians have tended to see the speech as a cold war maneuver directed primarily at U.S. allies in Europe. Eisenhower wanted to make sure that the European allies would go along with the shift in NATO strategy from an emphasis on conventional weapons to cheaper nuclear weapons. Western Europeans wanted reassurance that the U.S. did not intend to provoke a nuclear war in Europe, and the speech was designed primarily to create that sense of reassurance. Eisenhower later said that he knew the Soviets would reject the specific proposal he offered in the speech.\n\nEisenhower's invoking of \"those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched in\" the UN Charter placed new emphasis upon the U.S. responsibility for its nuclear actions—past, present and future. This address laid down the rules of engagement for the new kind of warfare: the cold war.\n\nTwo quotations from the speech follow:\n\nPrior to Eisenhower's speech, the state of atomic development in the world was under strict secrecy. The information and expertise needed for atomic development was bound by the secret Quebec Agreement of 1943 and thus not devoted to peaceful processes, but instead as a weapon to defend against other countries which were developing and using the same weaponry. With atomic development thus far under wraps, there were no safety protocols and no standards developed.\n\nEisenhower's speech was an important moment in political history as it brought the atomic issue which had been kept quiet for \"national security\" into the public eye, asking the world to support his solution. Eisenhower was determined to solve \"the fearful atomic dilemma\" by finding some way by which \"the miraculous inventiveness of man would not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.\" Unfortunately, Eisenhower was not completely effective in his repurposing; Eisenhower himself approved the National Security Council (NSC) document which stated that only a massive atomic weapon base would deter violence from the Soviet Union. The belief that to avoid a nuclear war, the United States must stay on the offensive, ready to strike at any time, is the same reason that the Soviet Union would not give up its atomic weapons either. During Eisenhower's time in office the nuclear holdings of the US rose from 1,005 to 20,000 weapons.\n\nThe \"Atoms for Peace\" program opened up nuclear research to civilians and countries that had not previously possessed nuclear technology. Eisenhower argued for a nonproliferation agreement throughout the world and argued for a stop of the spread of military use of nuclear weapons. Although the nations that already had atomic weapons kept their weapons and grew their supplies, very few other countries have developed similar weapons—in this sense, it has been very much contained. The \"Atoms for Peace\" program also created regulations for the use of nuclear power and through these regulations stopped other countries from developing weapons while allowing the technology to be used for positive means.\n\n\"Atoms for Peace\" created the ideological background for the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but also gave political cover for the U.S. nuclear weapons build-up, and the backdrop to the Cold War arms race. Under programs related to \"Atoms for Peace,\" the U.S. exported over 25 tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to 30 countries, mostly to fuel research reactors, and is now regarded as a proliferation and terrorism risk. Under a similar program, the Soviet Union (now Russia and some countries which are separated from it ) exported over 11 tons of HEU.\n\n\n\n"}

It ran between Layerthorpe on the outskirts of York to Cliffe Common near Selby. It opened in two stages, in 1912 and 1913, and closed in sections between 1965 and 1981. Between 1977 and 1979, passenger steam trains operated between Layerthorpe and Dunnington — the entire length of track at that time. In 1993 a small section was re-opened as part of the Yorkshire Museum of Farming at Murton.\n\nThe line gained its nickname of \"The Blackberry Line\" in the days when it used to transport blackberries to markets in Yorkshire and London.\n\nThe south end of the railway, from Wheldrake to Cliffe Common, was opened on 29 October 1912, with the remainder of the line opening on 19 July 1913. Although it was constructed primarily as a freight line, passenger trains were introduced from 1913, and during the First World War it was used as a diversionary route by the North Eastern Railway between York and Selby. Passenger services ended in 1926, though freight traffic prospered through the Second World War.\n\nIn 1923, most British railway companies were grouped into four large companies, with the nearby North Eastern Railway becoming part of the London and North Eastern Railway. However, the DVLR remained independent, and continued to do so even after nationalisation in 1948.\nIn 1964, British Railways closed the Selby to Driffield Line, meaning that the junction at Cliffe Common became redundant. With the connection to Selby now gone, the DVLR was left isolated at its southern end. The line was subsequently run from the Layerthorpe end but traffic generated by the southern section of the track was light so the decision was taken to close the line between Wheldrake and Cliffe Common in 1965. The section between Wheldrake and Elvington followed in 1968. Elvington was closed in 1973, leaving only approximately of track between Layerthorpe and Dunnington on the outskirts of York.\n\nIn 1976, the owners of the railway decided to operate steam trains between Layerthorpe and Dunnington, which was the entire length of the line at that time. A regular summer service started in 1977, with J72 locomotive number 69023 \"Joem\" (now preserved at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway) operating the services. By 1979, there were not enough passengers to justify continuing and the service ceased. The railway continued to carry occasional freight trains to Dunnington until 1981 when the grain driers at Dunnington closed and the last major source of freight for the line was gone. On top of that the railway was in desperate need of a major overhaul with the majority of the rails and buildings still being the 1913 originals. However, the owners decided that the lack of demand for freight failed to justify any plan of action other than to close the line down. The last train ran on 27 September 1981. In 1984 the holding company, \"Derwent Valley Holdings\", became Derwent London, now a multimillion-pound property investment and development company.\n\nThe Foss Islands Branch Line, to which the Derwent Valley Light Railway connected at Layerthorpe, was subsequently closed in 1989, and lifted in 1992.\n\nUntil 1990, a small preservation group, the Great Yorkshire Railway Preservation Society, was originally based at Starbeck near Harrogate. When this closed, the society members relocated to the Yorkshire Museum of Farming, and started to rebuild approximately of track towards York, including the section under the York by-pass. A new station was constructed using the original station buildings from Wheldrake, and the railway re-opened in 1993.\n\nThe line now runs a mixture of nine diesel locomotives on Sundays and bank holidays.\n\nThe track-bed from Layerthorpe to Osbaldwick, along with part of the former Foss Islands Branch Line in York, has been converted to a foot and cycle path, part of Sustrans route 66.\n\nWhilst future extension of the line towards Osbaldwick may be possible, as of 2018 there are currently still no formal plans for this.\n\nThe original railway was long, and served the following places:\n\n\nInitially trains were worked by locomotives owned by the North Eastern Railway (from 1923 LNER and from 1948 British Railways).\n\nThe railway purchased two railcars in the 1920s to operate a passenger service and the table below lists the stock owned by the company in the 1920s\n\nBetween 1929 and 1969 the line was again worked by main line locomotives.\n\nIn 1969 the DVLR decided to buy two ex-British Rail Class 04 shunters to operate services rather than hiring in British Rail Class 03 locomotives. The table below lists the locomotives owned by the DVLR\n\nJoem was purchased to run the short lived steam train passenger operation.\n\nThe following rolling stock is owned by the preservation group as of March 2010:\n\n\n\nIn 1952, the artist L. S. Lowry painted three scenes of York as a commission from York Art Gallery. One of the pictures, entitled \"A View of York (from Tang Hall Bridge)\" depicts playing fields next to the railway, with a cooling tower (since demolished) and York Minster in the background. The painting was sold to a private collector, but was loaned to the art gallery in 2015 for temporary display.\n\nIn 2013, York soprano Rebecca Newman, with the enthusiastic participation of DVLR staff and a cast of children and adults from the theatre company We Are Theatre, with the fixed equipment and rolling stock of the railway, and Maggi the puppy, created her version of the song \"Wonderful Dream (Holidays are Coming)\" as a charity Christmas video, on YouTube. It was very well reviewed and by November 2015 received over 200,000 views on YouTube.\n\n"}
{"id": "1811784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811784", "title": "Where the Boys Are", "text": "Where the Boys Are\n\nWhere the Boys Are is a 1960 Metrocolor and CinemaScope American comedy film directed by Henry Levin and starring Connie Francis, Dolores Hart, Paula Prentiss, George Hamilton, Yvette Mimieux, Jim Hutton, and Frank Gorshin. It was written by George Wells based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Glendon Swarthout. The screenplay concerns four college co-eds who spend spring break in Fort Lauderdale. The title song \"Where the Boys Are\" was sung by Connie Francis, who also co-starred in a supporting role.\n\n\"Where the Boys Are\" was one of the first teen films to explore adolescent sexuality and the changing sexual morals and attitudes among American college youth. Aimed at the teen market, it inspired many American college students to head to Fort Lauderdale for their annual spring break. It won Laurel Awards for Best Comedy of the Year and Best Comedy Actress (Paula Prentiss).\n\nThe main focus of \"Where the Boys Are\" is the \"coming of age\" of four girl students at a midwestern university during spring vacation. Merritt Andrews (Dolores Hart), the smart and assertive leader of the quartet, expresses the opinion in class that premarital sex might be something young women should experience. Her speech eventually inspires the insecure Melanie Tolman (Yvette Mimieux) to lose her virginity soon after the young women arrive in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Tuggle Carpenter (Paula Prentiss) seeks to be a \"baby-making machine,\" lacking only a man to join her in marriage. Angie (Connie Francis) rounds out the group as an athletic girl who is clueless when it comes to romance.\n\nThe girls find their attitudes challenged. Merritt, a freshman, meets the suave rich-boy Ivy Leaguer Ryder Smith (George Hamilton), a senior at Brown University, and realizes she's not ready for sex. Melanie discovers that Franklin (Rory Harrity), a boy from Yale University who she thought loved her, was only using her for sex. Tuggle quickly fixes her attention on the goofy \"TV\" Thompson (Jim Hutton), a junior at Michigan State University, but becomes disillusioned when he becomes enamored of the older woman Lola Fandango (Barbara Nichols), who works as a \"mermaid\" swimmer/dancer in a local bar. Angie stumbles into love with the eccentric jazz musician Basil (Frank Gorshin).\n\nThe post-adolescent relationship angst of Merritt, Tuggle, and Angie evaporates when they discover Melanie is in distress after going to meet Franklin at a motel and instead finding there another of the \"Yalies\", Dill, who had raped her. Franklin had moved on to another girl, but told Dill that Melanie was \"easy\" and set up the ambush. Melanie, with her dress torn, ends up walking into the busy road nearby looking distraught and wanting to die. Just as her friends arrive, she is sideswiped by a car and goes to the hospital.\n\nUltimately, it seems the girls have learned the potentially serious consequences of their actions, and they resolve to act in a more mature and responsible manner. The film ends on a melancholy note, with Melanie's recovering in the hospital while Merritt looks after her, and with Merritt's promises to Ryder to continue a long-distance relationship. He then offers to drive them back to their college.\n\n\nJoe Pasternak bought the film rights to the novel, which originally was known as \"Unholy Spring\", even before it was published. He assigned George Wells to write the script.\n\n\"There isn't a gat, knife, or marijuana cigarette in the whole thing,\" said Pasternak. \"These are good students. We'll use our young contract players, such as George Hamilton, Joe Cronin, Denny Miller, Alfredo Sadel, Bill Smith, Russ Tamblyn, Luana Patten, Maggie Pierce, Carmen Phillips, and Nancy Walters; then get one star to head the cast.\" Natalie Wood, who had just made \"All the Fine Young Cannibals\" for MGM, was mentioned as a possible star at one stage.\n\nMGM eventually persuaded the book's author to change the title from \"Unholy Spring\" to \"Where the Boys Are\".\n\nHenry Levin was signed to direct. The first two stars confirmed for the movie were George Hamilton and Yvette Mimieux. Paula Prentiss was cast despite never having made a movie before. Connie Francis also made her movie debut.\n\nThe novel contained a section where the students help raise money to ship arms to Fidel Castro for his revolution in Cuba. Pasternak decided to remove this. \"The author was very sympathetic to Castro,\" said Pasternak. \"Politics does not belong in entertainment. As actors or writers or movie makers of any sort, we have a right to our political preferences. But that is why we have secret ballots... We felt that the only revolution these youngsters should be involved in was their personal revolution.\"\n\nGeorge Hamilton got a bit part for his friend Sean Flynn in the movie.\n\nHamilton says he improvised the scene where he wrote a question mark in the sand to Dolores Hart. He thought he was making a \"little nothing of a film\" and did not enjoy the shoot but it became a big success. The film also featured the screen debut, in an unaccredited role, by former Miss Ohio and Elvis Presley consort Kathy Gabriel.\n\nThe kind of cool modern jazz (or west coast jazz) popularized by such acts as Dave Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan, and Chico Hamilton, then in the vanguard of the college music market, features in a number of scenes with Basil. Called \"dialectic jazz\" in the film, the original compositions were by Pete Rugolo.\n\nMGM had bolstered the film's success potential by giving a large role to Connie Francis, the top American female recording star and a member of the MGM Records roster. Francis had solicited the services of Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, who had written hit songs for her, to write original material for her to perform on the film's soundtrack including a \"Where the Boys Are\" title song. Sedaka and Greenfield wrote two potential title songs for the film, but producer Joe Pasternak passed over the song Francis and the songwriting duo preferred in favor of a lush 1950s style movie theme. Francis recorded the song on October 18, 1960 in a New York City recording session with Stan Applebaum arranging and conducting.\n\nAlthough it only peaked at #4 in the U.S., the theme song of \"Where the Boys Are\" became Connie Francis's signature tune, followed by several cover versions.\n\nBesides the theme song, Francis sang \"Turn on the Sunshine\", another Sedaka-Greenfield composition, in the film.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features \"Have You Met Miss Fandango?\" The song was sung by co-star Barbara Nichols and featured music by Victor Young and lyrics by Stella Unger.\n\nMGM did not release a soundtrack album for \"Where the Boys Are\".\n\nThe film was a success at the box office.\n\nMGM signed Henry Levin, Dolores Hart, Prentiss and Hutton to long-term contracts.\n\nAmerican humanities professor Camille Paglia has praised \"Where the Boys Are\" for its accurate depiction of courtship and sexuality, illustrating once-common wisdom that she contends has been obscured by second-wave feminism: \nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nIn 1960, it was announced Pasternak would make a follow up titled \"Where the Girls Are\", starring George Hamilton. It was meant to be an entirely different story rather than a sequel. But this was never produced.\n\nPasternak also announced plans to reunite Hamilton, Prentiss, Hutton and Mimieux in a romantic comedy titled \"Only a Paper Moon\" from a story by George Bradshaw, \"Image of a Starlet\". This became \"A Ticklish Affair\", and was made, but without any of those actors.\n\nNonetheless there were a number of unofficial follow-ups. MGM liked Paula Prentiss and Jim Hutton as a team so much they put them together in three more movies: \"Bachelor in Paradise\", \"The Honeymoon Machine\" and \"The Horizontal Lieutenant\". MGM also made a number of other romantic comedies in the style of \"Where the Boys Are\", including \"Come Fly with Me\" and \"Follow the Boys\".\n\nIt also inspired a number of imitations from other studios, including the \"Beach Party\" series and \"Palm Springs Weekend\".\n\n\"Where the Boys Are '84\" was released in 1984 by TriStar Pictures. While it bears the distinction of being the first film released by TriStar, the film was a critical and commercial failure. Although it was touted as a remake, Roger Ebert reported that \"It isn't a sequel and isn't a remake and isn't, in fact, much of anything.\"\n\n"}

Narona was established as a Roman trading post, after Rome's successful war (Illyrian Wars) with the neighboring Illyrian tribe Daors (ruins of their main city are located near Stolac), and successfully grew until the 3rd century AD. After that it went on a steady decline especially after a large 4th-century AD earthquake. Upon the arrival of Slavonic tribes in the mid-6th century AD, the city of Narona was abandoned with most parts being covered under silt that was carried by the river Neretva.

Founded in 1897 as the Country School for Boys, it was the first country day school in the US. It is named for Daniel Coit Gilman, the first president of The Johns Hopkins University and an early supporter of efforts by Anne Galbraith Carey to form an all-boys day school. \n\nGilman enrolls approximately 1,000 students, ranging from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, under the instruction of 146 faculty members. It is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools and the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association.\n\nDescribed by author C. Fraser Smith as \"Baltimore's most prestigious preparatory academy,\" It has strong academic and athletic reputations. In 2002, \"Worth Magazine\" rated Gilman among the top 30 feeder schools in the US, signifying the high rate of matriculation by Gilman graduates at top colleges and universities. Its graduates are known to be intensely loyal to the school. Examining the school's 2010 data, it was noted approximately 75% of the Board of Trustees were graduates of the school, one of the highest percentages of any educational institution in the US. Of Gilman's 16 varsity athletic programs, 15 have won conference championships since 2000, and in recent years its football, track & field, and lacrosse teams have appeared at or near the top of national rankings.\n\nProminent graduates of Gilman include author Walter Lord, sportswriter Frank Deford, Arizona Governor Fife Symington, Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, US Senator Daniel Brewster, US Congressman John Sarbanes, and composer Christopher Rouse.\n\nGilman was founded as The Country School for Boys by Baltimore resident Anne Galbraith Carey, with assistance from Daniel Coit Gilman (1831–1908, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, 1876–1908). The school opened its doors on September 30, 1897, in the old \"Homewood\" Mansion (now known as the Homewood Museum, off North Charles Street, constructed 1800 in Georgian-Federal style architecture, for Charles Carroll Jr. (1775–1825), also known as Charles Carroll of Homewood, son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence). By 1910, J.H.U. began moving its campus north from its former downtown location along North Howard Street by Little Ross, West Centre and West Monument Streets, in the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere to the newly named \"Homewood\" campus and constructing its first campus buildings of similar matching Georgian - Federal styles. In 1910, the Country School moved to its current 68-acre (275,000 m²) campus further north in the city to Roland Park, along Roland Avenue, just south of the Belvedere Avenue (and the future Northern Parkway). Here was begun one of the first planned suburban developments in America by the new Roland Park Company in 1891. At that time the institution changed its name to \"The Gilman Country School for Boys\", in honor of the seminal figure in its founding, Dr. Gilman. In 1951, \"Country\" was dropped from the name.\n\nGilman has two sister schools: Bryn Mawr School, across Northern Parkway from Gilman to the north and Roland Park Country School, across Roland Ave to the west. All three schools coordinate some Upper School (grades 9–12) classes to the extent that some classes have students from all three schools.\n\nThe school has three divisions: Lower School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight) and Upper School (grades nine through twelve).\nAt the Upper School level, students are required to take courses in history, mathematics, English, science, and a foreign language each semester; an intramural or interscholastic sport each season; and a minimum of art, music, and religion instruction over four years. Students must also fulfill a community service requirement and may choose to participate in a range of extracurricular activities. Gilman's Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program was ranked #312 in \"Newsweek's\" 2019 nationwide survey of US high schools.\n\nA number of courses permit cross-registration by students from two neighboring girls' schools: Bryn Mawr and Roland Park Country School. In turn, Gilman students, primarily seniors, are able to enroll in equivalent courses at these sister schools. Starting junior year, students are allowed to take necessary classes like English and other subjects at the sister schools. The school offers numerous courses, several through the tri-school collaboration. Cross-registration also allows for a variety of languages to be offered, which currently include French, Spanish, Latin, Ancient Greek, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and German.\n\nGilman enjoys a tradition of athletic success. Since the year 2000, 12 Gilman varsity teams have won at least one conference championship. Overall, the school sponsors 16 sports; most teams have varsity and junior varsity programs, while some have fresh-soph and/or middle school squads.\n\nGilman is perhaps best known for its success in football and lacrosse. The football team has won 13 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) \"A\" Conference championships in the last 20 seasons. The 2002 team finished 10–0 and was ranked 14th in the United States by USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll. That team featured the Associated Press's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year in quarterback Ambrose Wooden and lineman Victor Abiamiri. Both players went on to star at Notre Dame, and Abiamiri played five seasons for the Philadelphia Eagles. The 2005 team was ranked 12th in the nation in USA Today's Super 25 high school football poll.\n\nThe lacrosse team, led by coach, upper school history teacher, and Gilman alumnus (Class of 1987) Brooks Matthews, was ranked the #1 high school team in the United States by LaxPower at the conclusion of both the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The team has captured 16 MSA & MIAA \"A\" conference titles. The lacrosse program has produced many stars in college lacrosse.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 school year, six Gilman varsity squads (football, golf, ice hockey, squash, tennis & track and field) won conference titles. In 2008–09, the volleyball team won its first MIAA title, while the squash and swimming teams also won conference championships.\n\nGilman's biggest rival is the McDonogh School, located in suburban Owings Mills. A football game between the two schools has taken place every fall since 1914. Gilman leads this series, 60-35-5, including a win in the 100th game in 2015.\n\nFall offerings\n\nWinter offerings\n\nSpring offerings\nGilman's varsity athletic teams have won over 120 championships since 1940, including 41 conference titles since the MIAA was formed in 1994. The school currently competes in the association's highest grouping, or \"A\" conference, in every sport except for ice hockey.\n\nGilman confers over 50 awards at the upper school level for achievement in academics, athletics, student leadership, and extracurricular activities. Most prizes are bestowed on seniors; a smaller number are granted to underclassmen by design or as circumstances warrant. The majority are given on Awards Day, held each year in late May, while a handful of the highest honors are withheld until Founders Day, the day of Gilman's commencement ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\nGilman Schools official Instagram Page\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/gilmanschool/\n"}

Steingraber writes and lectures on the environmental factors that contribute to reproductive health problems and environmental links to cancer.\n\nSteingraber was adopted as an infant. She grew up and spent most of her childhood in Tazewell County, Illinois. Her mother was a microbiologist and her father was a community college professor. Her parents inculcated in her an interest in sustainable development and organic agriculture from a young age.\n\nIn her 20s, Steingraber developed bladder cancer. In several of her books, she describes an apparent cancer cluster in her hometown and within her family.\n\nAfter her cancer went into remission, Steingraber completed her undergraduate degree in biology from Illinois Wesleyan University. She worked for several years as a field researcher, eventually earning her doctorate in biology from the University of Michigan. Steingraber also holds a master's degree in English from Illinois State University.\n\nSteingraber has been on faculty at Cornell University, and is a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Division of Interdisciplinary and International Studies at Ithaca College, in Ithaca, New York. She held visiting fellowships at the University of Illinois, Radcliffe/Harvard, and Northeastern University, and served on President Bill Clinton's National Action Plan on Breast Cancer.\n\nIn her 1997 book, \"Living Downstream\", Steingraber blends anecdotes and descriptions of industrial and agricultural pollution with data from scientific and medical literature to assess the relationship between environmental factors and cancer. Steingraber criticizes the imbalance between funding devoted to studies of genetic predisposition to cancer versus studies of environmental contributions. The book claims that while we can do little to change our genetic inheritance, much can be done to reduce human exposure to environmental carcinogens.\n\nHer work \"Living Downstream: An Ecologist Looks at Cancer and the Environment\", reflects the ideals that Rachel Carson expressed in her seminal book, \"Silent Spring\". Carson discusses a woman with bladder cancer and investigates research how and why cancer is linked to the environment. Steingraber stresses issues such as how chemical pesticides find their way into human bodies. She states, \"in 1996 a study investigated six-fold excess of bladder cancer among workers exposed years before to o-toluidine and aniline in the rubber chemicals department of a manufacturing plant in upstate New York. Levels of these contaminants are now well within their legal workplace limits and yet blood and urine samples collected from current employees were found to contain substantial numbers of DNA adducts and detectable levels of o-toulidne and aniline.\"\n\"To the 89 percent of Illinois that is farmland, an estimated 54 million pounds of synthetic pesticides are applied each year. Introduced into Illinois at the end of World War II, these chemical poisons quietly familiarized themselves with the landscape. In 1950, less than 10 percent of cornfields were sprayed with pesticides. In 1993, 99 percent were chemically treated,\" (page 5).\n\"Living Downstream\" is the basis for a documentary by The People's Picture Company that chronicles Steingraber's struggles as a cancer survivor and her contributions as an ecologist and cancer prevention activist.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Steingraber was arrested along with nine other protesters for blocking the entrance to the Inergy natural gas facility near Ithaca to protest \"the industrialization of the Finger Lakes.\" After refusing to pay a fine, Steingraber and two other members of the \"Seneca Lake 12\" received 15-day sentences. Steingraber served 10 days in the Chemung County jail in the city of Elmira before her release.\n\nOn October 29, 2014 while participating in the civil disobedience campaign, called We Are Seneca Lake, Steingraber was arrested again with nine other protestors at the gates of Crestwood Midstream (formerly Inergy) for trespassing and blocking a chemical truck, which resulted in an additional charge of disorderly conduct. On November 19, in the Town of Reading Court, she was sentenced to 15-days in jail after refusing to pay her fine. She served 8-days in the Chemung County jail and was released. Steingraber detailed her experience in an \"Ecowatch\" article, \"Why I am in Jail.\" \n\nDr. Steingraber was the subject of the 2018 documentary, \"Unfractured\".\n\nSteingraber lives in Trumansburg, New York with her husband Jeff de Castro, a sculptor and art restoration specialist, with their two children.\n\n\n\n"}

The eight-limbed creature was one of many doppelgängers created by Magus during this conflict. The Doppelganger possesses Spider-Man's strength, speed, wall-climbing abilities, and spider-sense, and also has six arms, claws, fangs, and the ability to produce its own razor-edged webbing. It acts like an animal, and growls and hisses rather than speaks.\n\nThe Doppelganger began life as a living fractal, a geometric pattern in the Dimension of Manifestations, able to assume the forms and attributes of any being, real or abstract. When a mysterious Magus sets out to obtain the vast power of the Infinity Gauntlet, he contracts the ruling fractal, Prime Manifester Anthropomorpho, to transform several young fractals into monstrous versions of Earth's superheroes; the Doppelganger is one such creation, based upon Spider-Man. It and its brethren are sent to Earth to attack the heroes in the so-called Infinity War. The Doppelganger interrupts a fight between Spider-Man and Hobgoblin, who impales the creature upon a fence. Though most of the fractal doubles were completely destroyed upon being defeated, the Doppelganger is retrieved by the demonic Demogoblin, who infuses it with supernatural energy, enabling it to remain in the Earth dimension even following Magus' defeat. Demogoblin directs the Doppelganger in a grudge against Hobgoblin, whom the altruistic Spider-Man protects. The foursome's fight joins another battle where the supernatural Ghost Rider and Blaze are fighting a group of demonic Deathspawn and Spider-Man's murderous nemesis Venom. Both the Doppelganger and Demogoblin are subsequently pulled underground by the Deathspawn, with two Deathspawn briefly taking up silent residence within the Doppelganger's body.\nAfter being separated from the Demogoblin, the disoriented Doppelganger wanders around New York for some time. By the beginning of the \"Maximum Carnage\" storyline, it is attacked by the psychotic Carnage, who mistakes the creature as his mortal enemy, Spider-Man. However, Carnage's companion, the equally insane Shriek, takes a liking to the Doppelganger, and the deranged couple introduces their new \"son\" to the \"pleasure\" of random murder. During their spree, the three are joined by Demogoblin and Carrion; they also fight Spider-Man, Black Cat, Cloak and Dagger, Venom, Firestar, Morbius, and others. The Doppelganger becomes devoted to Shriek; when Carnage attacks her for rebellious behavior, it springs to her defense, but Carnage guts it and kicks it to the street several stories below, supposedly killing it. Carnage and the others were defeated shortly afterward.\n\nDoppelganger reappears, with a new physical configuration, trying to rescue Shriek (who he is implied to have been covertly visiting at Ravencroft) from an armored truck, but he is shot in half in the process by the iron rangers. Doppelganger is collected by Hall Industries, revives on the autopsy table, and joins Shriek in causing havoc in New York. When Doppelganger attempts to save Shriek from the new symbiote Scorn, he has knocked aside, and forced to flee with Carnage. When Carnage overtakes a Colorado town, the Mercury Team is able to locate him by attacking and following Doppelganger, who is referred to as \"that creepy thing that looks like Spider-Man\". Doppelganger later helps Carnage fight the Mercury Team, and is shown escaping after Carnage is captured, and a portion of the town is firebombed by the military.\n\nDoppelganger is later shown among the Spider-Totems assembled to help combat Morlun and the other Inheritors in \"Spider-Verse\".\n\nDoppelganger eventually reunites with Carnage and Shriek again and together formed a cult dedicated to worshiping Knull. They eventually return to Doverton and got the codexes–the symbiote remnants left on the bodies of previous hosts–from the citizens who were infected by Carnage.\n\nThe Doppelganger's abilities are very similar to Spider-Man's, including superhuman strength (able to lift 65 tons), agility, stamina, reflexes, and speed. It can also stick to walls and shoot razor-sharp webbing from the palms of its hands. It has two extra sets of arms, each hand possessing hardened talons that can tear through human tissue. The Spider-Doppelganger is physically stronger than Spider-Man, though the exact limit of his strength is unknown. It is noticeably unintelligent, seemingly limited to animal instinct, although it was capable of following instructions from its 'mother' Shriek, and was capable of rudimentary speech in its reappearance. Its body was also somewhat malleable and could form different shapes, although this attribute was not seen in its appearances in \"Maximum Carnage\". According to scientists who were briefly able to study him after apparent death, Doppelganger is \"inorganic and may not have been legally alive, to begin with\".\n\nDoppelganger is referenced in the alternate universe of the Clone Saga.\n\nA brainwashed Deadpool has an illusion of Doppelganger in \"Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was co-founded in 1992 by PMC-Sierra and Sun Microsystems. Several significant specifications were completed through its actions including PL-2, PL-3, and PL-4. Many important semiconductor devices were developed to these specifications. SATURN was also influential in the specification of the ATM Forum's physical layer \"UTOPIA\" standards.\n\nInitial members included SynOptics and Interphase. The first meeting was held in April 1992.

Davis played college football for the University of Georgia, and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Los Angeles Chargers. Davis recovered from three major ACL tears during his career, a feat no other professional athlete has done.\nThomas Antonio Davis Sr. was born on March 22, 1983 in Shellman, Georgia. He attended Randolph-Clay High School in Cuthbert, Georgia, where he was a four-sport star in football, basketball, baseball, and track. In football, he played running back, wide receiver, quarterback, defensive end, defensive back, punter, kicker, and kick returner at various times throughout his career. As a junior, he averaged 30 yards per punt, had two kickoff returns, one punt return, and one fumble return for touchdowns. As a senior, he earned Class AA All-State honorable mention by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Georgia Sports Writers Association (GSWA) after rushing for 1,032 yards, leading the region in scoring with 108 points in the regular season.\n\nIn addition to football, Davis played baseball and ran track, where he qualified for the GHSAAA State T&F Championships for the 100-meter dash, placing 6th with a time of 11.1 seconds, and the 400 relay, finishing in 43.98 seconds. In the agility tests, he ran a 4.54-second 40-yard dash, had a 355-pound bench press, 520-pound squat, 324-pound hang clean and 34-inch vertical jump.\n\nDavis was regarded by many as one of the finest athletes ever from the state of Georgia, but due to the small size of his school, his chances for exposure were relatively low. He was not highly recruited out of high school and was only offered a scholarship to one Division I college, which he accepted to become a member of the Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nDavis received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Georgia, where he played for coach Mark Richt's Georgia Bulldogs football team from 2002 to 2004. Following his sophomore season in 2003, he earned second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) honors. He was recognized as a first-team All-SEC selection and a consensus first-team All-American after his junior season in 2004. In 39 career games, he was effective as both a rush linebacker and a free safety, recording 272 tackles, 18 for a loss, 10.5 sacks, three interceptions, six forced fumbles, and nine fumble recoveries. He majored in consumer economics.\n\nDavis opted to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2005 NFL Draft as an underclassman. He attended the NFL Scouting Combine and completed the majority of drills, but opted to skip the bench press. Davis finished second among all linebackers who participated in the 40-yard dash, behind Texas linebacker Derrick Johnson. On March 22, 2005, Davis attended Georgia’s pro day, but opted to stand on the majority of his combine numbers and only ran the 40-yard dash and participated in positional drills. He improved his time in the 40-yard dash, finishing with a 4.52. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Davis was projected to be a first round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was regarded as one of the top safeties in the draft and was highly touted for his versatility and ability to play safety or linebacker. Davis was ranked as the top safety prospect in the draft by Scouts Inc. and ESPN and was ranked as the top free safety by DraftScout.com and the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers selected Davis in the first round (14th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Thomas was the first safety drafted in 2005.\n\nOn July 26, 2005, the Carolina Panthers signed Davis to a five-year, $10.60 million contract that includes $7.97 million guaranteed. The contract has a maximum value of $13.20 million with incentives and performance bonuses.\n\nDavis entered training camp as a safety, but also learned the linebacker position. On August 15, 2005, it was reported that the Carolina Panthers moved Davis to outside linebacker after Brandon Short injured his foot during a preseason game against the Washington Redskins. On August 20, 2005, starting strong safety Colin Branch tore his ACL during the Panthers’ 27-21 loss at the New York Giants in their third preseason game. Defensive coordinator Mike Trgovac opted to move Davis back to strong safety as a replacement for Branch. Head coach John Fox named Davis the starting strong safety to begin the regular season, alongside free safety Mike Minter.\n\nHe made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the Carolina Panthers’ season-opener against the New Orleans Saints and recorded five combined tackles during their 23–20 loss.

The contract also included an $8 million option bonus for 2012. On September 18, 2011, Davis tore his ACL in his right knee during third quarter of the Panthers’ 30-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 2. The injury occurred when Davis right leg was caught up in a pile of players. On September 19, 2011, the Carolina Panthers officially placed Davis on injured reserve. This became Davis’ third torn ACL in 23 months. No professional athlete had ever recovered and returned to play after three ACL tears. He stated at the time that he would become the first and hoped to be an inspiration to others. Davis finished the 2011 NFL season with 12 combined tackles (six solo) and was limited to two games and two starts.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, the Carolina Panthers chose not to exercise an $8 million bonus option on his five-year, $36.50 million contract. On February 25, 2012, the Carolina Panthers restructured Davis’ contract in order to save cap $3.80 million in cap space. His base salary for 2012 was restructured from $2.20 million to the veteran minimum of $700,000.\n\nDavis was held out of minicamp as he recovered from ACL surgery, but returned in time to participate in training camp. Davis had been replaced as the starting weakside linebacker by rookie first round pick Luke Kuechly. He competed against James Anderson to be the starting strongside linebacker. Head coach Ron Rivera named Davis the backup strongside linebacker, behind James Anderson, to begin the regular season. On September 9, 2012, Davis recorded three combined tackles during the Panthers’ season-opening 16–10 loss at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

He played alongside Chase Blackburn and Luke Kuechly to help Carolina achieve a second-ranked defense.\n\nThrough the first five weeks of the 2014 season, Pro Football Focus rated Davis as the best 4-3 outside linebacker in coverage. In the must-win finale at Atlanta, Davis returned a fumble 33 yards to set up a crucial touchdown that started the rout of the Falcons. The Panthers won the game 34-3, becoming the first team in the NFC South to win back-to-back division titles and sending the Panthers into the playoffs for the second year in a row, the first time in franchise history. Davis' leadership, play, and consistency was a big contributor in these achievements, along with those same attributes found in Kuechly and tight end Greg Olsen. In the Panthers wild-card playoff matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, Davis was a part of a stifling defense that set an NFL record for fewest yards allowed in a playoff game, limiting the Cardinals to just 78 total yards and forcing three turnovers. According to Pro Football Focus, Davis was the best defensive player on the field, registering seven tackles while also grading out as the best player in coverage for the Panthers, showcasing his roots as a safety. For the season, Davis was among the league leaders in pass coverage linebackers allowing just 7.1 yards per reception. On January 31, 2015, Davis was named the 2014 Walter Payton Man of the Year by the NFL, recognizing his off-the-field community service work.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, Davis signed a two-year contract extension.

Through the first 15 weeks of the 2015 NFL season, Davis set career highs in sacks (5.5) and interceptions (3). For his efforts, Davis was named to the 2016 Pro Bowl, a rare honor to an outside linebacker in a 4-3 defense. Davis finished the regular season with 105 total tackles, 5.5 sacks, and 4 interceptions. He was named to the AP All-Pro First Team. During the Divisional Round Playoffs, another showdown against Seattle, Davis secured the Panthers win by catching the Seahawks onside kick attempt with 1:12 left in the game, sending the Panthers into the NFC Championship Game. It was Davis' second onside kick recovery of the season, the first coming against the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving night game. Davis returned to the NFC Championship game for the first time since his rookie season in 2005, the only active Panther to have played in both conference championship games. Davis was knocked out of the conference win in the second quarter with a broken arm, and finished the game with six tackles. He vowed to return for the Super Bowl and went into surgery early the following morning on the arm to uphold that promise. Davis played in Super Bowl 50. In the game, he recorded seven tackles, but the Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24–10.

From January 1919 to July 1922 he was the High Commissioner of Spanish Morocco, where he used chemical weapons against civilians during the Rif War, saying he used them \"with true joy.\"\n\nHe was later court-martialled and discharged from the service when it was discovered that he was planning an uprising. He was saved by the coup d'état of Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923, then granted an amnesty and appointed military chief of the royal household.\n\nIn January 1930, following the forced resignation of the dictator Primo de Rivera, King Alfonso XIII ordered Berenguer to form a government and restore a degree of normality to the country. As prime minister, Berenguer repealed some of the harsher measures introduced by Primo de Rivera, earning his regime the nickname \"dictablanda\" (the toothless dictatorship, \"blanda\" meaning soft, as opposed to the preceding \"dictadura\", \"dura\" being the Spanish word for hard) or \"Parum Mentula\". He also faced a number of problems, such as increasing demands for the abolition of the monarchy, disorganisation among the country's political parties after seven years of repression making the calling of prompt elections an impossible task, labour unrest, and at least one military uprising.\n\nBerenguer resigned as prime minister on 14 February 1931; he was replaced by Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas under whom he served as Minister of War.\n\nTwo months later, Alfonso fled the country and the Republic was declared, and Berenguer then was imprisoned.\nHe died in Madrid in 1953.\n"}
{"id": "1811833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811833", "title": "WTBU (Boston University)", "text": "WTBU (Boston University)\n\nWTBU (640 kHz/89.3 MHz) is a \"Part 15\" student-managed and -operated radio station at Boston University. This means it is not licensed by the FCC but operates legally under special \"low power\" rules (not to be confused with LPFM FCC licensed stations). It has a block-format programming schedule, with individual DJs able to play pretty much whatever they choose during their weekly airshifts (usually two hours in length). Overall the sound skews mostly rock/alternative, but can vary significantly, including pop, urban, rap, classic rock, Triple-A, trance, electro, industrial and metal...or just true freeform.\n\nWTBU is on the air 20 hours a day, any day that the BU dorms are open (at least eight months of the year). During the summers the studios may be used for special classroom exercises by the Boston University College of Communication, or \"COM.\"\n\nTaking advantage of the large number of broadcast journalism majors at COM, there are regular newscasts and sports updates. There is also extensive live coverage of BU sporting events, like hockey, basketball, soccer and more.\n\nWTBU is entirely \"student managed.\" There is a faculty advisor with some oversight duties. Virtually all positions are unpaid volunteers. There is an informal policy of only having current students to be on the air; community volunteers and alumni are not allowed.\n\nThere is no formal class curriculum specifically for radio broadcasting at B.U., save for some broadcast journalism classes in COM that include radio.\n\n\"Much of this history is either directly from, or inferred from, early BU yearbooks and old editions of student newspapers like the Daily Free Press. There are no online versions available of these editions.\"\n\nThe earliest known reference to WTBU comes from the 1960 Boston University HUB (the name for the student yearbook at the time). Some students listed both WBUR and WTBU, suggesting that originally there was some overlap in staff between the two stations.\n\nThe studios were originally located on the second floor of the George Sherman (student) Union building. In 1969 it moved to the first floor of the Myles Standish Hall dormitory. In 1982, it moved into the new Myles Standish Annex, where the defunct Grahm Junior College was; the actual broadcast from the new space was delayed several months due to a broken water main. In the late 1980s, the basement studios were completely refurbished with new soundproofing, angled windows etc.. In 1997, WTBU moved to third floor of the College of Communication building at 640 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, taking over much of the space vacated by WBUR when it moved to 890 Commonwealth Avenue. Both stations remain in those spaces today. Before moving out, torrential rains in October 1996 flooded many basements (and the tunnel of the next-door MBTA Green Line!).\n\nThe heyday of WTBU seems to be in the late 1960s and early 1970s. While WBUR was suffering controversy after controversy (in 1964, a long process started of appointing professionals to run WBUR, only to have to fire them and start over again-a process that lasted until the early 1970s). During that time, WTBU enjoyed a significant boost in student attention from displaced WBUR volunteers and overall attention paid to \"underground\" radio stations by student protesters. As late as 1971 there were articles touting awards WTBU was winning (Station Manager George Schweitzer won the United Press International Broadcast Documentary Award First Prize), special broadcasts they were running (the \"Distinguished Lecture Series\", for example) and being a core member of the \"Ivy Network Corporation\", a collaboration between WTBU, WZBC, WBRS, WHRB, WTBS, WZLY and WBRU.\n\nAt some point in the 1980s, the tradition of \"Cram Jams\" was formally instituted. This refers to the last week or two of the semester, when finals are being taken. The entire WTBU schedule is revised and DJs tend to play music they feel is especially relevant to test-taking.\n\nIn the mid-to-late-1990s there was a general drop in interest in college radio, WTBU included; but by 2000, renewed interest in media in society had brought WTBU back up to near-24/7 broadcasting during the academic year. On Halloween night of 1999, WTBU started streaming on the web as a means of finally reaching both the campus as well as alumni. This drew WTBU national attention when Bill Rigby, the station manager at that time, was featured in the New York Times discussing the station's expansion to online. Today WTBU has over 100 student volunteers every semester.\n\nAdditional history can be found on the official WTBU website: wtburadio.org\n\nFamous WTBU alum include Howard Stern, the self-proclaimed King of All Media. He attended B.U. in the mid-1970s, and WTBU was the first station to fire Stern. As mentioned in his book \"Private Parts\", his show (the \"King Schmaltz Bagel Hour\") once aired a segment called \"Making the Bishop Blush\" in which they pretended a local Catholic Bishop was in the studio. They proceeded to make lurid statements and asked if the Bishop was blushing yet. Then-Program Director Hank Sennott was listening and fired Stern on the spot.\n\nMany WTBU alumni have gone on to careers in broadcasting and related fields, including:\n\nWTBU won \"Station of the Year from CMJ in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\nIt was nominated for mtvU Woodie Award in 2014 and 2015.\n\nWTBU is a Part 15 station, which means that it operates without an FCC license, but within the legal power limits. These limits are the equivalent to about one-tenth of a watt, and unlike antenna-based stations, \"carrier current\" works on a building-by-building basis – that is, if you are inside, say, Shelton Hall, you can hear WTBU on 640AM. But walk outside and within 25 ft the signal will disappear.\n\nThere are radiating cable FM transmitters (broadcasting at 89.3 MHz) in the Warren Towers and West Campus dormitories, and carrier-current AM transmitters (broadcasting at 640 kHz) in the Shelton Hall, Myles Standish Hall, and Danielsen Hall dormitories, as well as one in the COM building itself.\n\nSince the early-2000s, WTBU also relies on its webcast, and on an audio feed to the campus cable BUTV channel 6, to reach its listeners.\n\nWhile WBUR-FM is also owned by Boston University, it is an independently operated professional NPR news/talk station. There are a few work-study positions at WBUR-FM and sometimes they are filled by WTBU volunteers, but there is no formal connection between the stations.\n\n"}

{"id": "1811852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811852", "title": "Bill Donohue", "text": "Bill Donohue\n\nWilliam Anthony Donohue (born July 18, 1947) is an American Roman Catholic. He has been president of the Catholic League in the United States since 1993.\n\nDonohue was born in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, New York. He began his teaching career in the 1970s working at St. Lucy's School in Spanish Harlem. In 1977, he took a teaching position at La Roche College in McCandless, Pennsylvania. In 1980, he received his doctorate in sociology from New York University. Donohue is divorced and has two adult children from his marriage.\n\nHis first book was \"The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union\" and he became associated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, for which he is an adjunct scholar.\n\nWhile Donohue was in college in New York, Virgil C. Blum, a Jesuit at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, founded the Catholic League to counter anti-Catholicism in American culture. Blum died in 1990; in 1993, Donohue became the director of the organization. Under his direction, the organization has become far more prominent and vocal.\n\nDonohue publishes \"The Catalyst\", the Catholic League journal, and is a contributor to the online media organization Newsmax. He formerly served on the board of directors of the National Association of Scholars. He serves on the board of advisers of the Washington Legal Foundation, the Howard Center for Family, Religion and Society, the Society of Catholic Social Scientists, Catholics United for the Faith, the Ave Maria Institute, the Christian Film and Television Commission and Catholic War Veterans. He received the 2005 St. Thomas More Award for Catholic Citizenship from Catholic Citizens of Illinois.\n\nDonohue campaigns against what he perceives as the discrimination and defamation of Catholics and Catholicism. In doing so he has targeted a diverse array of organizations and individuals in entertainment, politics, and the arts. His work has produced divergent assessments. \"Legatus Magazine\", the monthly publication of an organization for Catholic business executives, wrote:\n\nA journalist once characterized the public perception of him as: \"Donohue serves as Santa to his membership of 350,000 and Scrooge to those who run afoul of him.\" In 2000, an editorial in \"America\", a Jesuit magazine, noted Donohue's bi-partisanship and willingness to break ranks with Republicans who aligned with him on most issues: \"once he was cheered by Catholic neo-conservatives for attacking the media, the entertainment industry and pro-choice groups, now he was excommunicated as a loose cannon because he was shooting at their allies. Mr. Donohue's refusal to be controlled by either party is one of his most attractive qualities.\" One critic described him as an \"identity politics ambulance chaser\" and another said he represented a \"right-wing publicity mill\". Others found that his defense of Catholicism sometimes crossed into attacks on other groups, and he has been accused of homophobia or even \"anti-gay bullying\" and antisemitism.\n\nIn 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility for a terror attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\" that killed 17 people and wounded 12 in Paris, including the editor of \"Charlie Hebdo\", who had been on an Al-Qaeda hit list. Commenting on the attack, Donohue wrote an article titled \"Muslims are right to be angry\":\n\nDonohue stated on Fox News \"Self censorship is the friend of freedom\" and that free speech should not permit \"obscene portrayal of religious figures\". Hugh Hewitt, a conservative Catholic talk show host, called Donohue \"an embarrassment\" to Catholics for his statement, saying \"You blamed the victim before their bodies were cold\" and \"You are standing over the bodies of twelve dead people, including two policemen, one yesterday and one today, who knows who else is going to get killed in France during the course of this thing, and you are saying they were justified because they were insulted\".\n\nIn response to Laudato si', Donohue described Pope Francis as \"the ultimate maverick\" on \"The Alan Colmes Show\", saying \"the left is going to like the fact that he has more of a socialist model in terms of his vision of the structure of the economy. He's anti-market in the encyclical.\" Donohue criticised \"The New York Times\" editorial board, saying they want \"the pope to shove his teachings down\" the throats of Republican legislators.\n\nDonohue believes marriage is \"not about love\" or \"making people happy\" but that the whole purpose of marriage is to have a family. Donohue is divorced.\n\nIn 2009, after the release of the official report of the Ryan Commission, whose findings included multiple instances of rape and persuasive evidence of endemic sexual, emotional and physical abuse throughout the Catholic School system in Ireland, Donohue publicly denied these criminal charges and characterized the media response to the Ryan Report as \"hysterical\". He argued that most offenses occurred before 1970 when \"corporal punishment\", as Donohue termed it, was not thought unacceptable, and referred to the victims as \"miscreants\". He noted the report's broad definitions of abuse, which included neglect and emotional abuse. Since the majority of priests are not rapists, he judged news headlines like Reuters' \"Irish Priests Beat, Raped Children\" were \"wild and irresponsible\", regardless of whether or not the headlines were true. He blamed the report and the journalists in turn.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, Donohue appeared on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on a panel discussing sexual abuse of children by priests. Donohue contended that the decades-old problem consisted mostly of offenses involving postpubescent boys aged 12 or more, which offenses therefore, according to Donohue, should be considered the acts of homosexual priests, rather than the actions of pedophiles. Donahue also points to the independent John Jay Report, which stated that 81% of the victims were male and 78% were post pubescent.\n\nIn August 2018, Donohue responded to a report by a Pennsylvania grand jury that revealed rampant sexual abuse of children by some 300 priests by stating that the victims weren't raped because they were only groped, not penetrated. \"There is no on-going crisis,\" he tweeted. \"In fact, there is no institution, private or public, that has less of a problem with the sexual abuse of minors today than the Catholic Church.\" Several individuals quickly condemned his statement; John Podhoretz, the editor of \"Commentary Magazine\", said, \"Bill Donohue's soul quickly leaked out of his body.\" Jim Lokay, an anchor for the Washington, D.C. affiliate of Fox News, tweeted that the Catholic League's statement was \"One of the most shameful, ignorant, tone-deaf, arrogant tweets I've ever seen.\"\n\nIn 1995, Donohue, joined by evangelical leaders, called for a boycott of Disney for distributing the British film \"Priest\", which depicted one priest struggling with his homosexuality and another involved in an affair with a woman. Donohue said the film was \"designed intentionally to insult the Catholic Church and Catholics nationwide\". The boycott had no impact, but helped Disney recognize the market for entertainment with religious themes.\n\nFor months in 1997 Donohue promoted a boycott of the advertisers of the television show \"Nothing Sacred\", the story of \"a sexy Catholic priest, Father Ray, who sometimes doubts his faith\". Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles and the \"National Catholic Reporter\" opposed Donohue's efforts. Some advertisers stopped placing ads with the show because of the controversy, but the show found replacements.\n\nOne study of the show said that the television series \"The Simpsons\" presented Catholicism with humor that had an \"undeniably hostile, sometimes gratuitous edge to it\" for years. Donohue objected to some dialogue in a November 1998 episode and other material in a January 1999 show that, in his view, made Catholicism the butt of a joke. In one case network executives substituted the name of a Protestant denomination for \"Catholic\" in later rebroadcasts.\n\nIn 1999, before the release of Kevin Smith's film \"Dogma\", Donohue reported that he had read the script and found it objectionable. He said: \"Quite naturally, the actors and film critics who like the movie are not disturbed by the anti-Catholicism that they themselves acknowledge, however unwittingly.\" After viewing the film in November, he wrote:\n\nSmith later said that the film proved less offensive than its critics had anticipated and that Donohue \"actually invited me out to have a beer after making my life hell for six months\".\n\nIn December 2004, Donohue defended Mel Gibson's movie \"The Passion of the Christ\". During a discussion of the film on the television show \"Scarborough Country\", Donohue said:\n\nWhen Rabbi Shmuley Boteach responded calling Donohue's statement anti-Semitic, Donohue said:\nIn November 2005, he criticized an episode of \"\" for promoting \"a pro-abortion rights agenda by portraying those who are opposed to abortion as religious nuts not to be taken seriously\".\n\nIn the spring of 2006, after Comedy Central refused to allow its animated television series \"South Park\" to show an image of Muhammad, Donohue said the show's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whom he had frequently criticized, should have protested that censorship by resigning, but instead \"Like little whores, they'll sit there and grab the bucks. They'll sit there and they'll whine and they'll take their shot at Jesus. That's their stock in trade.\" The next season, \"South Park\" parodied Donohue in the episode \"Fantastic Easter Special\". The episode depicts Donohue as a power-hungry Catholic official who usurps the Pope and sentences Jesus to death as a heretic; he is eventually killed by Jesus. Donohue took the episode in good humor, displaying a still from it in his office depicting him wearing the pope's miter. Describing the episode's plot to \"The New York Times\", he said \"...they have me overthrow the pope because the pope is a wimp, and then I take over the church and give it some guts ... But in the end, Jesus kills me.\"\n\nDonohue, along with a number of other religious leaders, criticized the children's fantasy epic \"The Golden Compass\". Donohue said that the trilogy of books on which the screenplay was based, \"His Dark Materials\", \"denigrate Christianity, thrash the Catholic Church and sell the virtues of atheism\". Though the film eliminated what he found offensive, he deemed it a \"stealth campaign\" to sell the books to readers unaware of their content. The impact of the resulting controversy on the film's commercial performance was uncertain.\n\nDonohue has regularly campaigned against the secularization of Christmas, which he describes as \"the diluting and dumbing down of the cultural and religious significance of Christmas.\" An Associated Press story once explained: \"As it is for millions of people, Christmas is Bill Donohue's busy season. While others spend time wrapping and shopping, Donohue stays busy sniping.\" He described the challenge: \"It's political correctness run amok. Every day I'm putting out a statement about the latest absurdity ... This time of year, you can just bank on it.\"\n\nIn December 2005, he criticized Christmas cards sent by U.S. President George W. Bush for using the term \"holiday season\" and not mentioning \"Christmas\". He said: \"This clearly demonstrates that the Bush administration has suffered a loss of will and that they have capitulated to the worst elements in our culture.\" In 2010, after an atheists organization used a billboard at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel to display the message \"You KNOW it's a myth!\" across the scene of the magi traveling to the manger at Bethlehem, the Catholic League responded with a billboard of its own. Donohue said \"We can't enjoy the Christmas season without someone trying to dumb it down or neuter it\" and added: \"Talk about a myth. They believe in nothing. They stand for nothing. They think we came from nothing. They're the ones who really are living in some other hollow world.\"\n\nIn 2013, he announced plans for a billboard reading \"Send Modern-Day Scrooges a Message: Celebrate the Prince of Peace\". As \"a tongue-in-cheek statement against political correctness\", he proposed a list of \"Office Party Rules to Ignore\" that included eliminating dress rules so women could display cleavage and scheduling the affair for a Friday to encourage alcohol consumption. It concluded: \"We happen to be Irish Catholics, a lot of us here, we're going to play to the stereotype.\"\n\nDonohue has been a consistent critic of same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2010, Frank Rich said that when Donohue extended his criticism of an art exhibit from one work he considered anti-religious and complained that it included \"pornographic images of gay men\", he \"was just using his 'religious' objections as a perfunctory cover for the homophobia actually driving his complaint\".\n\nEarly in the 2000 presidential campaign, Donohue criticized President George W. Bush for appearing at Bob Jones University, whose head once called Catholicism \"the religion of the Antichrist and a satanic system.\" He welcomed Bush's letter of apology for failing to make his opposition to the school's anti-Catholicism clear, saying: \"One of the great touchstones of Catholicism is forgiveness for the wrongdoer who admits that he or she is wrong, and there's nothing to be gained by beating this dead horse.\" He also criticized some of his co-religionists: \"There are some Catholics who are so desperate to get a Republican back in the White House, they're willing to overlook anything. Our feeling is, let the pus come to the surface.\" He raised a similar issue a few weeks later when the Republican leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives appointed a Protestant chaplain rather than the Catholic priest who received the greatest support from the bipartisan committee charged with the selection. Donohue ignored suggestions that he was not helping calm the situation by protesting. He said: \"There is a segment of the evangelical Protestant community that is anti-Catholic. It has been there for a long, long time. Everyone is saying, 'Let's not talk about it.' I don't want a strain between Catholics and Protestants, but I'm not going to paper this over.\" Within a few weeks, the Protestant chaplain withdrew and Hastert appointed the House's first Catholic chaplain, though not the original candidate.\n\nLater in 2000, he condemned Patrick Buchanan for launching his presidential campaign at Bob Jones: \"Buchanan is not alone among Catholics who have no problem recognizing anti-Catholicism when it stems from the academy or Hollywood, but are utterly unable to do so when it comes from their 'friends.' The Catholic League does not suffer from this disability and that is why we will continue to denounce anti-Catholic bigotry independent of its origins.\" By contrast, he excused John Ashcroft for accepting an honorary degree before Bob Jones' views became widely known.\n\nIn December 2007, he objected to a television commercial that former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee was using in his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The ad showed the candidate seated in front of a stained glass window that displayed, in Donohue's view, an image of the cross while Huckabee described the importance of Christmas and family. Donohue said: \"This is just injecting religion into politics even too far for guys like me.\" He believed Huckabee was identifying his religion to attack Mitt Romney's Mormon faith.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential race, Donohue called for Obama to disband his campaign's Catholic National Advisory Council, which he said represented only \"dissident Catholics,\" most with perfect ratings from the National Abortion Rights Action League.\n\nIn March 2009, he criticized President Obama's selection of Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius to head the Department of Health and Human Services, calling her \"one of the most extreme pro-abortion zealots in the nation\".\n\nIn June 2016, following the close of the New York State legislature without action on legislation designed to help survivors of childhood sexual abuse, Donohue wrote: \"The bill was sold as justice for the victims of sexual abuse, when, in fact, it was a sham: the proposed legislation that failed to make it to the floor of the New York State legislature in the wee hours of Saturday ... was a vindictive bill pushed by lawyers and activists out to rape the Catholic Church.\"\n\nDonohue called the decision of the University of Notre Dame to award an honorary degree to President Obama in 2009 \"a slap in the face to the bishops\" of the U.S. \"given what the bishops have clearly asked of Catholic institutions\".\n\nHe protested against what he considers employment discrimination against Catholics, in the case of a woman required by her supervisor to remove the Ash Wednesday ashes from her forehead in 2005. In 2007, when a substitute high school teacher in Georgia wiped the ashes from a student's forehead and berated her, Donohue called for the teacher to be disciplined. When school officials reported that the teacher had been \"counseled and cautioned\", Donohue called the teacher's behavior \"morally reprehensible\" and asked state education officials to investigate the incident.\n\nHe faulted the owners of the Empire State Building for failing to honor Mother Teresa in 2010 and Cardinal Timothy Dolan in 2012. He said: \"There's no question that they're much more at home honoring mass murderers there at the Empire State Building and I'm not being facetious. They honored Mao Zedong and others for the 60th anniversary of the Communist Revolution here a few years ago, who took with him 77 million innocent Chinese men, women, and children\".\n\nIn 1999, Donohue called for people to picket the Brooklyn Museum of Art to protest its display of a painting by Chris Ofili titled \"The Holy Virgin Mary\" that, according to \"The New York Times\", depicted \"a black Madonna with a clump of elephant dung on one breast and cutouts of genitalia from pornographic magazines in the background\".\n\nOn November 30, 2010, Donohue denounced a piece of video art, \"A Fire in My Belly\" by David Wojnarowicz, that was included in an exhibition of gay and lesbian portraiture at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery. The piece included a scene with ants crawling on a crucifix. Donohue called the video \"anti-Christian hate speech\" and called for its removal, which the Smithsonian did. Frank Rich described the work as consistent with the use of religious imagery in the Western tradition: \"A crucifix is besieged by ants that evoke frantic souls scurrying in panic as a seemingly impassive God looked on.\" During an interview with National Public Radio about the incident, Donohue questioned the Smithsonian's status as a tax-supported institution:\n\nThe Association of Art Museum Directors called the Smithsonian's decision \"extremely regrettable\", and Olga Viso, director of the Walker Art Center and formerly of the Smithsonian, said her former employer had \"perhaps lost touch with some of the core principles and spirit of its establishment\". One of the exhibit's curators said that Donohue represented an anti-Semitic hate group that viewed gays and lesbians as \"raw meat\" in the culture wars.\n\nIn 2012, a Manhattan art gallery displayed \"Immersion (Piss Christ)\", a photograph by Andres Serrano that depicts a small plastic crucifix submerged in the artist's urine. Donohue protested at a news conference outside the gallery and was then denied admission. He pointed out that the Obama administration had recently criticized a film critical of Islam, \"Innocence of Muslims\", but said nothing about Serrano's work. He made his own video of an Obama bobblehead doll with a brown substance, actually \"brown Play-Doh\", he said, to demonstrate \"that the cultural and political elite are basically secularist; they don't believe in God.\" Pointing to the jar in the video he said: \"This is their god.\"\n\nDonohue has had a long-running dispute with political and social commentator Bill Maher.\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin in her 2007 Primetime Emmy acceptance speech, mocked award recipients who thanked God when accepting awards by saying \"So all I can say is suck it, Jesus, this award is my god now!\" Donohue called her language \"obscene and blasphemous\" and said: \"It is a sure bet that if Griffin had said, 'Suck it, Muhammad,' there would have been a very different reaction\".\n\nIn 2010, after the openly gay pop star Elton John described Jesus as a \"compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems\", Donohue objected:\nDiscussing Christopher Hitchens's study of Mother Teresa, he termed the author \"totally overrated as a scholar ... sloppy in his research\", but nevertheless found much to admire, saying: \"[I]n many respects he was a brilliant guy, he was quick, he was a provocateur, and that's the part of Christopher Hitchens that I loved. But when it came to the facts it didn't seem to matter to him.\" Donohue said he and Hitchens agreed on abortion, though Hitchens' views on abortion were not exactly those of Donohue. In 1993, Hitchens characterized his thinking as \"I have my doubts about abortion. I find I'm very squeamish on the subject\".\n\n\n"}

It is officially a coalition partner of the ruling party, Fidesz, but is in reality a satellite party of Fidesz and has been unable to get into the Parliament on its own since 2006. For several elections prior to the pact, they had been unable to pass the election threshold of 5% of the vote. Without Fidesz, its support cannot be measured, and even a leading Fidesz politician, János Lázár, stated that Fidesz does not consider the government to be a coalition government.\n\nThe party was founded under the name of KDNP on 13 October 1944 by Hungarian Catholic statesmen, intellectuals and clergy, and was a successor to the pre-war United Christian Party. Among the founders were Bishop Vilmos Apor, Béla Kovrig (president of the University of Kolozsvár), , General József Pálffy, ethnographer Sándor Bálint and political journalist István Barankovics. It was an offshoot of the \"Catholic Social Folk Movement\" (KSzN), a civil organization. At the beginning of 1945 they elected Barankovics as principal secretary.\n\nThe new KDNP enjoyed just four or five months of semi-legality towards the end of World War II. At the end of the war, the communist-dominated post-war authorities refused to legalize it or permit it to operate further. Despite attempts by Varga and Barankovics, they were refused official permission to operate and take part in elections. Some of the party's founders, including Varga, were imprisoned for some days by detachments of the Arrow Cross Party.\n\nMeanwhile, some party members were saying that Barankovics conceded too much to the communist-influenced authorities in return for too little, and there was growing friction between two factions: the Christian socialist left wing led by Barankovics and the conservative-clerical right wing led by József Mindszenty's confidant, József Pálffy. The left wing gained increasing ascendancy in the party, and on 8 May 1945, Barankovics replaced Pálffy as president. The party changed its name to the Democratic People's Party (DNP), while a group led by Pálffy founded a new party called KDNP, which, however, failed to remain legal in an atmosphere of increasing Soviet influence. The 1947 elections saw the DNP finish second in the popular vote, winning 60 of the 411 seats.\n\nDNP was a democratic and anticommunist organisation. In 1949, Mátyás Rákosi asked Barankovics for the party's leaders to help him in the show trial against Cardinal Mindszenty, who was already ill in prison. Barankovics refused and, abandoning his party, escaped to Austria in an American diplomat's car. Many people followed his example; others were imprisoned by communists. The party was subsequently dissolved in January 1949.\n\nThe party was refounded in 1989 with its present name. The link between the historical party and the present one is disputed, although prominent members of the original party, like László Varga, took part in its refoundation. It was part of the Hungarian National Assembly between 1990 and 1998. From 1998 on, it has been closely associated with the Hungarian party Fidesz. In 2005 Fidesz and the KDNP signed an agreement for election cooperation, a result of which the KDNP obtained seats in the National Assembly. In the 2006 elections this alliance gained strength, winning 42.0% of the list votes and 164 representatives out of 386 in the National Assembly. The party decided to form a self-contained parliamentary faction with 23 representatives. It is the third largest faction in the National Assembly and co-operates closely with the Fidesz faction. , the party leader is Zsolt Semjén, deputy prime minister.\n\nKDNP is a right-wing, conservative Christian party. It is well known in Hungary for its traditional-marriage, pro-life and anti-immigration stance, and its representatives voted against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe because it did not refer to Europe's Christian heritage (although the party does not consider itself Eurosceptic).\n\nKDNP has supported the severe restriction on Sunday shopping (\"free Sunday\", as they called) for a long time, citing Christian values. Parliament voted on the issue on December 14, 2014 and the law came into effect on March 15, 2015 (a Sunday on which shops would have been closed anyway, the day being a public holiday in Hungary). Public opinion was predominantly against the decision. Three polls done in the spring of 2015 registered an opposition of 64% (Szonda Ipsos), 62% (Medián) 59% (Tárki). By the end of May, according to a poll by Medián, 72% of those polled disliked the new law, even the majority of Fidesz-KDNP voters were against it. Opposition parties and private persons tried to start a public referendum several times. By November 2015 there were 16 such attempts, but none of them were approved, for various bureaucratic reasons, until in early 2016 one of these attempts, initiated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, was finally successful. The government, rather than being forced to hold the referendum (which could have been interpreted as a huge success for the opposition party, even though the law was opposed by the majority of Fidesz voters too) lifted the ban in April 2016.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811858", "title": "Atlantic City Line", "text": "Atlantic City Line\n\nThe Atlantic City Line (ACL) is a commuter rail line operated by NJ Transit (NJT) in the United States between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New Jersey, operating along the corridor of the White Horse Pike. It runs over trackage that was controlled by both the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines. It shares trackage with SEPTA and Amtrak on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) until it crosses the Delaware River on its own Delair Bridge into New Jersey. The Atlantic City Line also shares the right-of-way with the PATCO Speedline between Haddonfield and Lindenwold, New Jersey. There are 14 departures each day in each direction. Conrail also uses short sections of the line for freight movements (which are segregated), including the NEC-Delair Bridge section to its main freight yard in Camden, New Jersey. Unlike all other NJT railway lines, the Atlantic City line does not have traditional rush hour service. The Atlantic City line is colored dark blue on New Jersey Transit's system maps, and the line's symbol is a lighthouse.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Atlantic City was the major seaside vacation destination for the Philadelphia area for both wealthy and working class alike. Similar to Coney Island in New York, the popularity of Atlantic City was made possible by rail transport providing inexpensive service between the city where people lived and the seashore where they played. By its height in the 1920s, there were no fewer than three competing railroad Main Lines connecting the Atlantic City resort with Philadelphia, the Atlantic City Railroad (ACRR), owned by the Reading Company, the Camden and Atlantic (C&A) and the West Jersey and Seashore (WJ&S), both owned by the PRR. Competition was fierce and the ACRR and C&A lines boasted some of the fastest trains in the world, while the WJ&S was a pioneering example of railroad electrification.\n\nThe Great Depression caused the first consolidation of the various competing lines into the new Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL), but the post-war rise of the automobile and the Atlantic City Expressway not only caused people to abandon the railroad for their cars, but also to abandon Atlantic City for more exotic vacation destinations. By the late 1960s, the surviving former Camden and Atlantic \"Main Line\" was reduced to a commuter service funded by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) running trains of Budd RDC railcars operating from a small terminal at the Lindenwold PATCO station. Conrail took over from the PRSL in 1976, maintaining service between Lindenwold and Atlantic City, Ocean City and Cape May. In 1981 NJDOT discontinued the chronically under-performing South Jersey rail services.\n\nAlmost immediately, there was talk of restoring the line to Atlantic City. Casino gambling had brought the aging resort back from the brink of financial collapse and local politicians were irritated that most railway transportation projects benefited the more populous northern portion of the state. A deal with Amtrak was worked out where the line, suffering from decades of deferred maintenance and in places outright abandonment, would be completely rebuilt for a new Amtrak service. Dubbed the \"Gambler's Express,\" service connected Atlantic City with cities up and down the Northeast Corridor as well as a local commuter service run by NJT.\n\nThe line reopened May 23, 1989, with Amtrak \"Atlantic City Express\" service running from New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. Service was soon extended to Springfield, Massachusetts, and Richmond, and for a brief period, the Philadelphia International Airport. NJT commuter service between Atlantic City and Lindenwold began in September. At Lindenwold, passengers had to transfer to PATCO. By 1994, Amtrak realized that their Atlantic City plan was poorly marketed, and high fares hurt potential ridership. As a result, it was announced that Amtrak would discontinue service effective April 1, 1995.\n\nInitially, there were worries that NJT would also cease operations, as Amtrak had been helping maintain the track and NJT would be forced to buy its own fueling facility. However, NJT reluctantly opted to stay, as the line was the transit agency's only commuter line in South Jersey. For the time being, a target of a US $1 million subsidy reduction was set in March 1996. NJT eventually extended service into Philadelphia (via Amtrak's 30th Street Station), and a new station facility was built in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Ridership increased and NJT decided to maintain the line after declaring that the line's ridership had met the target set for it.\n\nAnother improvement that has since occurred was the starting of a shuttle service between the Atlantic City Rail Terminal and the city's casinos. Free jitneys shuttle passengers to the shore and the various casinos.\n\nOn May 12, 2009, New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine, in conjunction with the Delaware River Port Authority (the agency which manages the PATCO Speedline), announced plans to review ways to expand and enhance the Atlantic City Line, in which the DRPA would \"examine opportunities to improve this system including the development of a Transfer Station at the PATCO Woodcrest Station allowing for more convenient transfers between PATCO, New Jersey Transit and convenient access from I-295\" and \"also identify track improvements to facilitate more frequent, reliable service and a better connection to the Atlantic City Airport Terminal.\" The study would be part of a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey that would include a new diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro and express bus service along the NJ 42 and NJ 55 freeways. However, in 2014, any plans described by the study to increase frequency to reliable hourly service, and to add planned Woodcrest and Airport transfer stations, were nixed because of state budget tightening.\n\nLater, NJ Transit built a transfer station in Pennsauken to connect the Atlantic City Line with the River Line, which runs from Camden to Trenton, where it meets up with Northeast Corridor trains to New York. This enables Atlantic City passengers to travel as far as New York completely on New Jersey Transit rail and light rail and avoid transfers in Pennsylvania for the first time. The Pennsauken Transit Center opened to passengers on October 14, 2013.\n\nThe line received some damage from Hurricane Sandy on October 29–30, 2012, causing suspension of service after the storm moved away. However, the damage was not as severe as on other NJT rail lines in the northern part of the state, and normal rail service was restored by November 4, one of the few NJT rail lines to do so in such short time.\n\nAlso operating along the line, but not making any stops along it, was the Atlantic City Express Service (ACES), a route owned by Caesars Entertainment and the Borgata and operated by NJ Transit under contract. This route operated between the Atlantic City Rail Terminal and Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan. This service began in February 2009 and ended in March 2012.\n\nOn September 4, 2018, the line was shut down so NJ Transit could replace a portion of the track, as well as install positive train control to comply with a December 31 deadline from the Federal Railroad Administration. The rail line was the only one in New Jersey that was shut down in its entirety, which sparked criticism from residents. NJ Transit operated bus service along the route while the rail line is shut down. Service - including an additional morning peak trip to Philadelphia - resumed along with the Princeton Branch on May 12, 2019.\n\nThe line was originally double-tracked but is now a single-track operation, with passing sidings along its length. The Atlantic City Rail Terminal incorporates a fueling facility and trains are fueled in between midday runs. Daily inspections and light maintenance are performed at the Atlantic City Rail Terminal by Herzog Transit Services, while heavy maintenance must take place in NJT's facility in North Jersey. Both cars and locomotives involved with servicing are shuttled up and down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor on weekends for washing and heavy maintenance as needed.\n\nAs rebuilt by Amtrak, most of the line was equipped with cab signaling and built to Class 4 track standards allowing speeds up to . Around of tangent track around Absecon was built to Class 5 standards, allowing speeds up to . Several years after Amtrak ceased operation on the line, NJT downgraded this segment to Class 4 due to maintenance cost considerations. Until 1995, Amtrak's Section E dispatcher controlled the line from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, but after the incorporation into the NJT system, the dispatching was shifted to Hoboken Terminal, and later the Meadows Maintenance Complex.\n\nPrior to the 1995 takeover, NJT trains terminating at Lindenwold would actually run to just east of the present day Cherry Hill Station where the nearest passing siding was located in order to clear the line for \"Gambler's Express\" trains and to allow the crew to change ends. After the terminal was moved to 30th Street Station, NJT commuter trains laid over at the south end of the station platforms to allow the diesel locomotives to exhaust into the open air (as opposed to under the confined space under 30th Street Station).\n\nRegularly scheduled service on the Atlantic City Line consists mainly of ex-Penn Central GP40PH-2B diesel locomotives pushing or pulling primarily a three- to four-car Comet train, although other rolling stock is also used on the line. When Amtrak had regular service on this line, power was provided by now-retired F40PH locomotives, with a Metroliner cab car on the opposite end to provide push-pull operation. All trains run with the locomotive on the west end and the cab control car on the east end to facilitate boarding and reduce diesel noise and exhaust issues at the Atlantic City Terminal.\n\nOriginally, a type of proof-of-payment fare collection was envisioned for the line to cut down on operating costs. Standard railway tickets were purchased from vending machines which then had to be validated prior to boarding. However, the system was never fully implemented and tickets were always collected normally on board by conductors.\n\nIn 2014, the line had around 1 million riders, which declined to 800,000 in 2016. Daily ridership is around 2,000 passengers. \n\nAtlantic City Line train tickets are also honored on the 551 and 554 NJT bus lines for travel to and from railroad stations at all times. Customers using rail tickets to ride the 554 line must board and alight directly at or within one block of the Lindenwold, Hammonton, Egg Harbor City, or Absecon train stations, or at the Atlantic City Bus Terminal. Tickets for travel between Philadelphia and Atlantic City are honored on the 551 between the bus terminals in the two cities.\n\n"}

He was the first Briton to finish the Tour de France and the first to win a Tour stage. He won the 1961 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race. His success as a professional cyclist in mainland Europe paved the way for other Britons such as Tom Simpson and Barry Hoban.\n\nRobinson grew up during the Second World War, which began when he was eight years old.\n\nHis family lived in Ravensthorpe and moved to Mirfield in 1943.\nBoth his parents worked at a factory producing parts for Halifax bombers, Henry at night and Milly by day.\nThe family had a small area of land, known as an allotment, where they kept rabbits and two pigs. Robinson had a brother, Des, and a sister, Jean.\n\nRobinson rode with the Huddersfield Road Club at 13 and joined when he reached the club's minimum age the following year. His elder brother, Des, and his father were already members. His father, however, would not let Robinson start racing until he was 18. His first race was a hilly 25-mile time-trial in March, which he completed in 1h 14m 50s. His ambition was not to ride against the clock, but in massed road races. Opportunities were limited. Views on British road racing were polarised between the British League of Racing Cyclists, which wanted road racing on open roads, and the National Cyclists' Union, which feared police and public reaction and confined racing to closed circuits.\n\nRobinson was an NCU member. He worked for the family building business, training before and after work, and frequently raced on roads in Sutton Park, Birmingham, where races had to end by 9.30 am so the public could use the park. In 1948 he went to Windsor to watch the Olympic Games road race in Windsor Great Park \"little realising that four years later I would make the next Olympics in Helsinki\".\n\nHe was fifth in the NCU massed-start championship and third in the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) hill-climb championship in 1950. The following year, he was equal 7th in the Isle of Man International, 10th in the NCU massed-start championship, and second in the RTTC hill-climb championship. In 1952 he was fourth in the NCU title race, won the hill-climb championship, and was fifth in the Isle of Man International.\n\nIn spring 1952 whilst doing his National Service Robinson rode the Route de France, amateur version of the Tour de France, in a joint NCU/Army team. He rode well and was fifth with three days to go, but poor days in the Pyrenees saw him slip to 40th. \"I had never seen mountains like that before,\" he said.\n\nThe following August, he represented Great Britain at Helsinki in the Olympic Games road race. Robinson finished 27th, one place behind his brother, to André Noyelle of Belgium. The future Tour de France winner, Jacques Anquetil, was 12th, and Robinson raced against him again in the world cycling championship in Italy in September 1952 where they tied for eighth.\n\nIn 1953, Robinson left the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and joined the Ellis Briggs team as an independent, or semi-professional. He rode the Tour of Britain in 1952, wearing the leader's yellow jersey before finishing fourth.\n\nThe following year, 1954, he improved to second, and second in the mountains competition.\n\nThe British cycle industry, fighting in a dwindling market, competed for sales by sponsoring riders. Hercules and BSA had supported long-distance record-breakers when there was no other professional racing on the road and now wanted to have road-racing teams.\n\nHercules planned a team that would be the first from Britain to ride the Tour de France, then based on national teams. The riders in its colours grew season by season until in 1955 it had Robinson, Bernard Pusey, Dennis Talbot, Freddy Krebs, Clive Parker, Ken Joy, Arthur Ilsley, Derek Buttle (the founder of the team) and Dave Bedwell. The team raced in France, the Netherlands and Belgium in preparation. Robinson was 8th in Paris–Nice, fourth in La Flèche Wallonne and led the Tour of the Six Provinces to the sixth stage. The eventual Tour team was a mixture of Hercules riders and those from other sponsors.\n\nThe Tour de France proved tough and only Robinson and Tony Hoar finished, Robinson 29th and Hoar lanterne rouge or last. They were the first Britons to finish the Tour, 18 years after Charles Holland and Bill Burl were the first Britons in the race in 1937.\n\nRobinson told Jock Wadley of Sporting Cyclist that it was easy for an English professional to get into the Tour de France in 1955. \"Indeed, when it came to selection time there were hardly enough riders available to fill the places.\" Hercules and other British sponsors dropped their sponsorship at the end of 1955. Robinson, who had married the previous October, set up at the start of 1956 at Les Issambres, the area of the French Riviera that Hercules had used for its training the previous year and which was close to the spring criteriums. He and another professional, Bernard Pusey, suffered because the first races were cancelled because of snow.\n\nIn 1956, the Tour allowed mixed teams. Robinson joined a squad which included Charly Gaul. He took third on the first stage, and by the end of the Tour was 14th, Gaul 13th. He also rode the Vuelta a España in Hugo Koblet's Swiss-British team, and was second after the fourth stage. He punctured on a climb on the 10th stage when in a break with Italy's Angelo Conterno, the race winner, but managed to recover from 11th to eighth.\n\nIn 1957 he scored his first professional win, in the GP de la Ville de Nice, beating Louison Bobet by 50 seconds. Then he finished third in Milan–San Remo to Spain's Miguel Poblet, whose 29th birthday it was. \"Cycling\" called it \"by far the greatest achievement by a British roadman in a single-day race since the halcyon 19th-century days of George Pilkington Mills and the Bordeaux–Paris\". There was commercial intrigue behind the result, however.\n\nRobinson crashed on wet cobbles early in the 1957 Tour de France, injuring his left wrist. He recovered to finish 15th in the world championship won by Rik Van Steenbergen.\n\nIn 1958, Robinson won stage seven of the Tour de France, to Brest. Arigo Padovan crossed the line first, but was relegated to second for his tactics in a hot sprint.\nRobinson showed his victory was no fluke by winning the 20th stage (from Annecy to Chalon-sur-Saône) of the 1959 Tour by 20 minutes. Next day he paid the price, trailing far behind the field with his Irish teammate, Seamus Elliott, beside him.\n\nBoth finished outside the time limit and expected to be sent home. But the team's manager, Sauveur Ducazeaux, insisted the judges apply a rule that no rider in the first ten could be eliminated. Robinson had started the day ninth: it was Elliott who was sent home. \"The mother hen was cooked; the chick avoided the pot\", Fotheringham said.\n\nRobinson finished the Tour 19th, having at one time been ninth. That year he helped get his professional Rapha Geminiani team to sign Tom Simpson. Within weeks, he was watching Simpson win two stages of the Tour de l'Ouest.\n\nRobinson finished 26th and 53rd in the Tours of 1960 and 1961. In between he won the 1961 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, winning two stages. He was part of the winning team in the team time-trial, then third in the individual time trial at Romans. He won the following day's stage at Villefranche. He kept control of the race as it passed through the mountains and won the race.\n\nRobinson retired when he was 33, not having made much money from cycling despite his successes.\n\nThe magazine \"Cycling\" placed Robinson ninth best British rider of the 20th century.\n\nRobinson, at 74, helped organise a dinner in August 2005 to mark the 50th anniversary of the first British competitors in the Tour de France. The event aimed to attract all British riders who have raced in the Tour since 1955.\n\nIn 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.\n\nRobinson's daughter Louise became an accomplished cyclo-cross rider, taking a silver medal at the 2000 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Two of Brian's grandchildren are also competitive racing cyclists: Jake Womersley competing in cyclo-cross and road racing and Becky Womersley in road racing.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, Robinson was knocked off his bike in a collision with a car driver whilst riding through Thornhill Lees, suffering a fractured collar bone, six broken ribs, a punctured lung.\n\nRobinson was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2017 New Year Honours for his services to charity and cycling.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on the type of cardiac arrhythmia, defibrillation is applied, and medication is administered. Oxygen is administered and endotracheal intubation may be attempted to secure the airway. At regular intervals, the effect of the treatment on the heart rhythm, as well as the presence of cardiac output, is assessed.\n\nMedication that may be administered may include adrenaline (epinephrine), amiodarone, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, potassium and magnesium. Saline or colloids may be administered to increase the circulating volume.\n\nWhile CPR is given (either manually, or through automated equipment such as AutoPulse), members of the team consider eight forms of potentially reversible causes for cardiac arrest, commonly abbreviated as \"6Hs & 5Ts\" according to 2005/2010 AHA Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). \nNote these reversible causes are usually taught and remembered as 4Hs and 4Ts—including hypoglycaemia and acidosis with hyper/hypokalaemia and 'metabolic causes' and omitting trauma from the T's as this is redundant with hypovolaemia—this simplification aids recall during resuscitation.\n\n\nAs of December 2005, advanced cardiac life support guidelines have changed significantly. A major new worldwide consensus has been sought based upon the best available scientific evidence. The ratio of compressions to ventilations is now recommended as 30:2 for adults, to produce higher coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. Defibrillation is now administered as a single shock, each followed immediately by two minutes of CPR before rhythm is re-assessed (five cycles of CPR).\n\nALS also covers various conditions related to cardiac arrest, such as cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), poisoning and effectively all conditions that may lead to cardiac arrest if untreated, apart from the truly surgical emergencies (which are covered by Advanced Trauma Life Support).\n\nMany healthcare providers are trained to administer some form of ALS.\n\nIn out-of-hospital settings trained emergency medical technicians, paramedics or medics typically provide this level of care. Canadian paramedics may be certified in either ALS (Advanced Care Paramedic-ACP) or in basic life support (Primary Care Paramedic-PCP). Some Primary Care Paramedics are also trained in intravenous cannulation, and are referred to as PCP-IV (see paramedics in Canada). Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) are often skilled in ALS, although they may employ a slightly modified version of the medical algorithm. In the United States, Paramedic level services are referred to as advanced life Support (ALS). Services staffed by basic EMTs are referred to as basic life support (BLS). Services staffed by advanced emergency medical technicians can be called limited advanced life support (LALS), Intermediate Life Support (ILS), or simply advanced life support (ALS), depending on the State. In the Republic of Ireland, advanced life support (ALS) is provided by an advanced paramedic. Advanced Paramedic (AP) is the highest clinical level (level 6) in pre-hospital care in the Republic of Ireland based on the standards set down by PHECC, the Irish regulatory body for pre-hospital care and ambulance services. This terminology extends beyond emergency cardiac care to describe all of the capabilities of the providers.\n\nIn hospitals, ALS is usually given by a team of doctors and nurses, with some clinical paramedics practicing in certain systems. Cardiac arrest teams, or \"Code Teams\" in the US, generally include doctors and senior nurses from various specialties such as emergency medicine, anesthetics, general or internal medicine.\n\n"}

{"id": "1811903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811903", "title": "Hollaback Girl", "text": "Hollaback Girl\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" (2004). It is a hip hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip hop and dance music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo; it was released as the album's third single on March 15, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies.\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year at the 48th Grammy Awards, but lost in both categories. \"Hollaback Girl\" divided pop music critics, with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing; men's magazine \"Maxim\" named it as the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, it topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for four weeks and was ranked at number two on the Year-End Hot 100. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified Platinum in United States by the RIAA, and in Australia by the ARIA.\n\nA music video representing Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by Paul Hunter. The video received four nominations at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, and ultimately won for Best Choreography. Stefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on numerous occasions, including on all three of her concert tours, and on several televised appearances.\n\nAs part of Gwen Stefani's vision of creating \"a silly dance record\", she had worked with The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo) during the early stages of writing songs, including \"Hollaback Girl\" for her debut solo album \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\"; however, a case of writer's block resulted in reportedly uninspired collaborations. As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with The Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet. When she returned to the studio, Williams began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious. Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Williams, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.\n\nTo search for inspiration, Stefani and Williams had a lengthy discussion in which Stefani said that she had yet to write a song about her intentions for pursuing a solo career. She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love had made about her in an interview with \"Seventeen\" magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school. But I'm not interested in being the cheerleader. I'm not interested in being Gwen Stefani. She's the cheerleader, and I'm out in the smoker shed.\" Stefani responded to Love's comments in the March 2005 issue of \"NME\": \"Y'know someone one time called me a cheerleader, negatively, and I've never been a cheerleader. So I was, like, 'OK, fuck you. You want me to be a cheerleader? Well, I will be one then. And I'll rule the whole world, just you watch me. The song uses the lyric and a melodic interpolation, of \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen, referencing the common usage of the song at sporting events, aimed at losing opponents, with Stefani's antagonistic stance likely aimed at Love.\n\nStefani believed that some of the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, \"[They] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'.\" She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"\n\nBecause Stefani never disclosed the song title's meaning, reviewers came up with various interpretations. In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, \"OC Weekly\" critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\". The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" is a hip hop song that draws influence from 1980s hip hop and dance music. It is a moderately fast song, with a tempo of 110 beats per minute, and it is played in the key of D minor. Like the majority of pop music, it is set in common time. The main chord pattern of the song alternates between B major and D minor triads. Most of the harmonic content of the song revolves around a two-chord alternation which music theorists may regard as an L (leading tone) transformation, in which the root of the major chord is lowered by a half-step to form a second inversion minor chord on the third scale degree, a slight tonicization of B major, but resolving back to D minor by having the same A, a perfect fourth down from D. This stepwise motion between B and A highlights this chord change. It is in verse-chorus form with a bridge before the fourth and final chorus. The song features sparse instrumentation, primarily a minimal beat produced by drum machine. A guitar plays the song's riff, a six-note pattern as Stefani repeats \"this my shit\" during the chorus, and a brass section joins during the second chorus. In part because of its cheerleading motif, it drew comparisons to Toni Basil's 1982 song \"Mickey\".\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Yahoo! Music's Jennifer Nine described it as a \"stomping, stripped-back\" track, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that it had the \"thumping, minimal beats\" of The Neptunes. Richard Smirke of Playlouder called it \"a trademark Neptunes hip-hop stomp.\" In his review of \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\", Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the song a positive review, writing that \"Stefani's gum-snapping sass brings out the beast in her beatmasters, especially the Neptunes in 'Hollaback Girl'.\" \"Blender\" listed it as the 11th best song of 2005, and the song tied with Damian Marley's \"Welcome to Jamrock\" for number five on the 2005 Pazz & Jop, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau.\n\nOn the other hand, Jason Damas, in a review for \"PopMatters\", felt that the song sounds \"almost exactly like Dizzee Rascal\", and added, \"Lyrically, this is where Gwen sinks the lowest here, especially on a breakdown where she repeats, 'This shit is bananas / B-A-N-A-N-A-S!' several times\". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B called the song \"moronic and embarrassingly tuneless. I'd quote the lyrics, but they're so bad, I almost feel sorry for her. A 35-year-old woman singing about pom-poms and 'talking shit' in high school betrays such a delusional self-image that it's hard not to be taken aback. And on top of that, The Neptunes' beats are clunky and the production is senselessly bombastic.\" Nick Sylvester of \"Pitchfork\" also criticized the track, referring to it as a \"Queen pastiche [...] which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID\". However, despite this initial review, Pitchfork would later place the track at number 35 on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2005, and at number 180 on its list of The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s. \"Maxim\" was unimpressed with the song, and in its October 2005 issue, published a list of the \"20 Most Annoying Songs Ever\" with \"Hollaback Girl\" in first place. Cat Conway of \"Drowned in Sound\" gave the song a negative review, saying \"Hollaback Girl\" sees Gwen Stefani getting a big lick off , delivering vocals that sound like she needs a Sudafed.\" \n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 82 on the issue dated April 2, 2005, and within six weeks of its release, it had reached the top of the chart, becoming Stefani's first and only US number one. It replaced 50 Cent's \"Candy Shop\" featuring Olivia, which had spent the previous nine weeks at number one on the chart. It maintained the number-one position for four consecutive weeks. \"Hollaback Girl\" ranked second on the 2005 Hot 100 year-end chart, beaten by Mariah Carey's \"We Belong Together\". \"Hollaback Girl\" held the record for most US radio airplays in one week, with 9,582 plays, and maintained this feat for over a year before Shakira and Wyclef Jean's \"Hips Don't Lie\" overtook the position. It peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100 chart for eight weeks and at number 15 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song was a crossover success, and reached number four on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number eight on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nThe song was noted for having a large number of digital downloads, becoming the first single to sell more digital downloads than CDs. In October 2005, \"Hollaback Girl\" was the first single to ever sell one million digital downloads and later went on to sell a total of 1.2 million downloads; it was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was later re-certified platinum, for the same sales, due to the change of the RIAA certification criteria for singles. On the year-end list for Hot Digital Songs in 2005, \"Hollaback Girl\" placed at the top of the chart.\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" was successful in Canada, where the song debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Canadian Singles Chart. However, Graham Henderson, president of the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), later argued that based on Canada's population relative to the US, the single should have sold around 120,000 copies and that the comparatively lower sales of 25,000 were a sign that the Canadian copyright law should be tightened to discourage non-commercial peer-to-peer file sharing. Columnist Michael Geist disputed the comparison, arguing that the Canadian online music market was still developing. The song was released in Australia on May 23, 2005, debuting at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart, and in Europe on June 6, 2005, reaching number five on the European Hot 100 Singles. In the United Kingdom, however, \"Hollaback Girl\" did not perform as well as Stefani's previous releases. The song's predecessors, \"What You Waiting For?\" and \"Rich Girl\", had both reached number four, while \"Hollaback Girl\" debuted at number eight, and stalled at the same position the following week. Although its UK success was limited, it remained in the top 40 for an additional 11 weeks. The single was largely successful across Europe, reaching the top five in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Ireland, and the top 10 in Belgium, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe music video for \"Hollaback Girl\" was directed by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California. The video opens with a scene of Stefani taking a picture of her four Harajuku Girls, when a crowd of students appears. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls then drive down Sherman Way past Magnolia Science Academy to Birmingham High School in a 1961 Chevrolet Impala, accompanied by the crowd. Stefani and the group cause a commotion when they disrupt a football game by walking onto the field and when they go to a 99 Cents Only Store and throw cereal and other food products down an aisle. Throughout the video, there are intercut sequences of choreographed dancing filmed in a sound stage, intended to represent Stefani's imagination. Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are outfitted in cheerleading uniforms, accompanied by several Californian spirit groups: the Orange Crush All Stars, a cheerleading squad from Orange County; a marching band from Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley; a pep flag team named the Carson High School Flaggies from Carson; and a drill team from Stephen M. White Middle School in Carson. To visualize the song's bridge, the Harajuku Girls spell the word \"bananas\" with cue cards. The video ends with a close-up frame of Stefani with her arms in the air.\n\nThe Chevy Impala convertible from the video includes a painting by artist J. Martin. The design includes Stefani as seen on the album cover of \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" with the words \"Hollaback Girl\" in calligraphy. The car was, eventually, sold on eBay. Pharrell Williams, one of the song's co-producers, makes a cameo appearance. The complete version of \"Hollaback Girl\" featured in the music video was released commercially through CD singles and digital downloads, and some include remixes by Diplo and Tony Kanal.\n\nThe video debuted on March 21, 2005 and proved successful on video chart programs. It debuted on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" on March 31 at number 10 and remained on the program for a total of 50 days, becoming what \"Rolling Stone\" called \"a staple of MTV's \"TRL\"\". The video reached the top of the chart and was retired at number four on June 23, becoming Stefani's first video to retire. VH1 listed the video at number five on its Top 40 Videos of 2005, and at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video received four nominations, but only won the award for Best Choreography. Stefani did not attend the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, prompting rumors that she was protesting her lack of nominations the previous year, her multiple losses to Kelly Clarkson, and her not having been asked to perform. Stefani denied the rumors, responding, \"the only reason I am not attending the MTV Video Music Awards is because I will be recording and spending time with my family.\"\n\nStefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on several occasions, including on two of her concert tours, in addition to several appearances on television shows. During the majority of the 2005 Harajuku Lovers Tour, Stefani sang the single as an encore performance, where she wore a drumming costume and encouraged the audience to sing along with her. However, in earlier shows, before the single's success, she sang it before tracks \"Serious\" and \"Bubble Pop Electric\". During The Sweet Escape Tour, she performed the song in the middle of the show wearing sparkly red shorts and an argyle jacket atop a L.A.M.B. black and white shirt. She also sported a belt buckle featuring the \"G\" motif frequently used in \"The Sweet Escape\".\n\nWhen Stefani agreed to be a judge on season 7 of the American reality series \"The Voice\", she sang the track in May 2014 alongside Williams, who would also be appearing on the show as a judge. For the rendition, Stefani wore a black jumpsuit in contrast to Williams, who wore a Mickey Mouse-sweater and jeans. The performance prompted the song to enter the \"Billboard\" Pop Digital Songs component chart, where it re-entered at number thirty-four. On the May 4, 2016, episode of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\", Stefani sang a snippet of the song alongside James Corden in his show's segment \"Carpool Karaoke\". In addition to Stefani and Corden, actor George Clooney and actress Julia Roberts sang along; when the song concluded, Clooney stated \"this shit's bananas\". More recently, the single was included on her 2016 concert series This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour. On 27 November 2019, Stefani performed \"Hollaback Girl\", alongside \"What You Waitin’ For\" and \"Rich Girl\", in a medley on The Voice season 17 to commemorate \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\"s 15th anniversary.\nDiplo made a remix for the track after M.I.A. turned down an offer to produce one. Tony Kanal, fellow No Doubt member, produced a remix titled the Dancehollaback Remix. The track features reggae singer Elan Atias, whose debut album Kanal produced. It appears as a single on iTunes, on the CD single for \"Cool\", and on the bonus CD of the deluxe edition of \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" Stefani later requested to contribute vocals on \"I Wanna Yell\" from Atias's debut album \"Together as One\", and was featured on his song \"Allnighter\". Gabe Saporta of Cobra Starship also recorded a parody of the song titled \"Hollaback Boy\".\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1811906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811906", "title": "Kapellbrücke", "text": "Kapellbrücke\n\nThe Kapellbrücke (literally, Chapel Bridge) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning the river Reuss diagonally in the city of Lucerne in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel, the bridge is unique in containing a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with a larger part of the centuries-old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbrücke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.\n\nPart of the bridge complex is the octagonal tall (from ground) \"Wasserturm\", which translates to \"water tower,\" in the sense of 'tower standing in the water.' The tower pre-dated the bridge by about 30 years. Over the centuries, the tower has been used as a prison, torture chamber, and later a municipal archive as well as a local treasury. Today, the tower is closed to the public, although it houses a local artillery association and a tourist gift shop.\n\nThe bridge itself was originally built 1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications. It linked the old town on the right bank of the Reuss to the new town on the left bank, securing the town from attack from the south (i.e. from the lake). The bridge was initially over long, although numerous shortenings over the years and river bank replenishments mean the bridge now totals only long. It is the oldest surviving truss bridge in the world, consisting of strutted and triangulated trusses of moderate span, supported on piled trestles; as such, it is probably an evolution of the strutted bridge.\n\nThe Kapellbrücke almost burned down on 18 August 1993, destroying two thirds of its interior paintings. Shortly thereafter, the Kapellbrücke was reconstructed and again opened to the public on 14 April 1994 for a total of CHF 3.4 million.\n\nLucerne is unique in that its three wooden pedestrian bridges, the 14th-century Hofbrücke (now destroyed) and Kapellbrücke and the 16th-century Spreuerbrücke, all featured painted interior triangular frames. None of Europe's other wooden footbridges have this feature. The paintings, dating back to the 17th century and executed by local Catholic painter Hans Heinrich Wägmann, depict events from Lucerne's history. Of the original 158 paintings, 147 existed before the 1993 fire. After the fire, the remains of 47 paintings were collected, but ultimately only 30 were fully restored.\n\nThe wooden boards that held the paintings varied from to wide and to wide. Most of the panels were made from spruce wood boards, and only a few were made from linden wood and maple. The paintings were created during the Counter-Reformation, featuring scenes promoting the Catholic Church. The paintings were sponsored by the city's council members, who, upon sponsoring a panel, were allowed to attribute their personal coat of arms on it. An explanation of each painting was printed below each scene. The paintings ran all along the bridge, dating from the life and death of Lucerne's patron saint St.Leger to the legends of the city's other patron saint St. Maurice.\n\n"}
{"id": "1811907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811907", "title": "The Rescue (Doctor Who)", "text": "The Rescue (Doctor Who)\n\nThe Rescue is the third serial of the second season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on 2 January and 9 January 1965 on BBC1. It was written by outgoing story editor David Whitaker and directed by Christopher Barry.\n\nIn the serial, the time travellers the First Doctor (William Hartnell), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) befriend Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), an orphan girl marooned on the planet Dido who is being threatened by an apparent native of Dido called Koquillion (Ray Barrett) while awaiting rescue.\n\n\"The Rescue\" was produced in a six-episode block with \"The Romans\" and was the first story produced in \"Doctor Who\" second production block. Rehearsals and recording took place from 30 November to 11 December 1964, entirely in-studio. The two episodes were watched by 12 and 13 million viewers in the UK respectively and have received generally positive reviews from critics, who praise the character-based storytelling, although plot holes were noted. Both episodes of \"The Rescue\" have been retained in the BBC archives, and the story has been novelised and released on VHS and DVD. The serial is notable as the first appearance of O'Brien as companion Vicki.\n\nThe First Doctor, Ian and Barbara are still missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands on a planet the Doctor eventually recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors of a space crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when the survivors of the crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.\n\nThe Doctor enters Bennett's room, and finds things are not as they seem. The supposedly crippled Bennett is missing, and a tape recorder hides his absence. He finds a trap door in the floor of the cabin and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.\n\n\"The Rescue\" was written as a short vehicle to introduce Vicki as the new companion, replacing Carole Ann Ford (Susan) when Ford decided she wanted to leave the series, and is thus more character-driven than anything that had preceded it. Vicki was a replacement for the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan (Carole Ann Ford). In contrast to Susan, Vicki is an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like \"Lukki\" and \"Tanni\". \"Doctor Who\" creator Sydney Newman told actress Maureen O'Brien that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, \"Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?\"\n\n\"The Rescue\" is the first story under Dennis Spooner as script editor, though he is not listed in the credits because he had little to do since much of the job was given to his predecessor David Whitaker and thus he is not credited. The story was commissioned on 1 November 1964, the day after his contract with the BBC for his position as script editor had expired. The scripts were due on 10 November. In Whitaker's original draft, entitled \"Doctor Who and Tanni\" after one of Vicki's original names, there are a few differences from the broadcast version. Bennett was more unkind to Vicki. Notably, Koquillion had a \"torch\" device, which he used to paralyse Ian upon meeting and interrogating him and Barbara in the first episode. He hypnotised Ian and Barbara and tried to get them to encourage the Doctor to come out of the TARDIS, but the Doctor could see this on the TARDIS' scanner and demands the teachers be released. In a scuffle Ian's trance was broken when he was shoved against the TARDIS and Barbara's was broken when she was thrown to the ground. The beginning of the first episode also had Ian confide to Barbara that he was afraid of a time where the Doctor would close the TARDIS on them and leave like he did with Susan, to which the Doctor, overhearing, replied that there would be warning if they were to part.\n\nO'Brien had just come out of drama school when she was cast as Vicki; it was her first television acting job. Director Christopher Barry originally wanted Bernard Archard for the role of Bennett/Koquillion, but was not able to get him. Barry would later cast Archard in \"The Power of the Daleks\" (1966). The role went to Australian actor Ray Barrett, whom Barry had seen on TV and marked in his book of actors he wanted to remember, and so he \"dug him out of the book\" when the time came. Barrett played Bennett as a \"normal, straight human being\" so as not to give the ending away. To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by \"Sydney Wilson\" — a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of \"Doctor Who\", Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. This was the first instance of an alias being used in the credits in order to conceal a plot twist in \"Doctor Who\"; the practice would be employed later on to conceal the appearance of villains Davros and the Master. Tom Sheridan provided the voice of the space captain and also played the Sand Beast. He was originally scheduled to play one of the Didonians at the end, but for unknown reasons they were played by two uncredited extras, John Stuart and Colin Hughes.\n\n\"The Rescue\" was the first in a new production block of \"Doctor Who\"; the first production block lasted for 52 weeks with one episode filmed per week, though the final two stories, \"Planet of Giants\" and \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\", were held back and the first season ended early. As such, there was a six-week break for the regular cast before work on \"The Rescue\" began. \"The Rescue\" used the same production team as the following story, \"The Romans\", and the two were combined to form a single six-episode production block. Model filming took place in Ealing studios on 16 November 1965. The models were made by an outside modelmaker called Shawcraft. As they were not designers, \"Doctor Who\" designer Raymond Cusick drew what he wanted the spacecraft to look like in more detail than he normally would have. He drew the spacecraft in flight as well as it wrecked so they could visualise it from the two. Cusick had found a cheap material he called \"reeded hardboard\", which was spray-painted silver and used for the outside of the craft prop. The design of Koquillion was based on a close-up of a fly.\n\nRehearsals for the first episode took place from 30 November 1964 to 3 December, with the episode recorded on 4 December. Ford visited during rehearsals to meet O'Brien and wish her luck. Rehearsals for the second episode took place from 7–10 December 1964, with the episode recorded on 11 December. Recording of the first episode overran its schedule by fifteen minutes. The Dido temple was a large set that was lit in such a way to create a dark atmosphere; dark drapes and smoke were also used. When shooting Vicki's Sand Beast, Jacqueline Hill underestimated the gun's power and fired too soon; she was not seriously injured, though suffered shock and a sore face because it blew back in her face. The sound the Sand Beast makes while dying was modelled after the \"horrible noise\" a dying Dalek made in \"The Daleks\". To save money, the score is reused from \"The Daleks\", which Barry had partially directed. He selected pieces from episodes one and four through to seven of that serial.\n\n\"The Rescue\" was broadcast on BBC1 in two weekly parts; the first episode aired on 2 January 1965, with the second on 9 January. The first episode, \"The Powerful Enemy\", was watched by 12 million viewers and was the eleventh most-watched programme of the week. The second episode, \"Desperate Measures\", was watched by 13 million viewers and was the eighth most-watched programme of the week. This figure was higher than the preceding story, \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\", which was an event story. Audience Appreciation Indexes were taken for both episodes and garnered 57 and 59 per cent respectively.\n\nOn 13 December 1966, a retention order was issued that included both episodes of \"The Rescue\" to be retained by the BBC. However, both episodes were wiped, the first on 17 August 1967 and the second on 31 January 1969. Fortunately, BBC Enterprises had retained both episodes and returned them to the BBC in 1978.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"As a vehicle to introduce a companion, \"The Rescue\" just about works, but it's too inconsequential to sustain any real interest.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described the story as \"one of the best examples of character-driven drama from this period of the series' history\". While they noted there were some unexplained parts of the plot, they felt that it was generally believable and said that \"Vicki actually steals the show here\". In 2008, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" described \"The Rescue\" as a \"neglected gem\" with a strong debut for Vicki and many production improvements. Despite this, he wondered \"how convincing Bennett's masquerade as Koquillion was in 1965\" as in the present day it seems \"a tad obvious\". DVD Talk's Stuart Galbraith felt that the story was \"quite strong\" with a \"smart, if somewhat predictable climax and resolution\" that worked due to the dialogue. Den of Geek wrote that the serial was only let down by its \"weak and convenient resolution\" and provided good material for the main cast. \"Dreamwatch\" gave \"The Rescue\" a score of 7 out of 10, calling it a \"solid enough adventure\" with a slight plot but brisk pacing that allowed Ian and Barbara to be more heroic.\n\nA novelisation of this serial written by Ian Marter was published by Target Books in August 1987. Marter died soon after completing the manuscript. It was subsequently edited and published, with some new material added by Nigel Robinson, editor of the Target Books line. An unabridged audio reading of the novelisation, read by O'Brien, was released by AudioGo on 1 April 2013.\n\n\"The Rescue\" was released on 5 September 1994 on VHS with \"The Romans\". It was released on DVD on 23 February 2009, again with \"The Romans\". The Region 1 release followed on 7 July 2009.\n\n"}

It was the main symbol of Burundi and its \"Mwami\" (King) and had semi-divine status. The \"Mwami\" was said to interpret the beatings of the karyenda into rules for the kingdom.\n\nWhen Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962, the karyenda was the symbol on the national flag and its coat of arms from 1962 to 1966. It was replaced after the republic was established. Traditionally the most important folk songs and dances were performed to extol the virtues of the kingship. A major festival was the annual \"umuganuro\" (sorghum festival), which was a huge display of pomp, festivities, and dances for the royal court. Since the fall of the monarchy in 1966, and particularly after a massacre of Hutus in 1972, such cultural expressions have waned. \n\nThe second most important drum was the \"rukinzo\". It accompanied the \"mwami\" wherever he went.\n\nThe drums, despite many upheavals, have remained popular and are still revered. The old families who were wardens of the drums have tried to keep the ancient traditions alive. Some have an international outreach, such as the Royal Drummers of Burundi, or L. Ndoricimpa and C. Guillet, who recorded \"Les tambours du Burundi\" (\"The Drums of Burundi\") in 1983.\n\nAs sacred objects, the drums were much more than simple musical instruments. They were used in rituals, such as the \"umuganuro\", or for special circumstances. Major events for the king, such as royal coronations, funerals, and weddings were announced through the drums. The beating of the drums also signalled certain rites, such as when the \"mwami\" rose in the morning or retired in the evening.\n\nDrums had various names, such as \"dispenser of peace\" or \"lady of the land\".\n\nThe Royal Order of Karyenda and the Royal Order of Rukinzo were founded by King Mwambutsa IV of Burundi on July 1, 1962. The Order of Karyanda was the principal order of the kingdom and was divided into five classes.\n\nThe drums were normally kept in drum sanctuaries. These were a tight network of high places, as well as centres of political and religious power in pre-colonial Burundi. The sanctuaries were guarded mainly by Hutu families, who were the only ones the king allowed to manufacture, play, and keep the drums or bring them to court for an occasion. They were called \"abatimbo\", which is Rundi for drummers \"who hit hard\". A sacred drum was enthroned in each sanctuary and guarded by attendants. There were also \"ingendanyi\" (minor drums), and a set of drums that were played with the main drums.\n\nSome of the main sanctuaries for the drums were: Gishora Hill, near Gitega; Higiro Hill, also near Gitega; Magamba Hill; and Banga.\n\n"}

At the same time, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) travels to Nero's palace to save his fellow schoolteacher Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), who had been sold to Nero's wife Poppaea (Kay Patrick) as a slave.\n\nThe story is notable for its use of humour.\n\nWith the TARDIS stuck at the bottom of a cliff, the First Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki have installed themselves in an unoccupied Roman villa. As the Doctor and Ian recline, Barbara and Vicki walk to a nearby Roman village. They are spotted by two slave traders, Didius and Sevcheria. When they return to the villa the Doctor announces that he is off to Rome, some miles away, and will travel there with Vicki. Later that evening Barbara and Ian, now alone, are relaxing when the two slavers burst in upon them. They are overpowered and taken prisoner. Ian is sold to one slave owner, while Barbara is to be traded with another and sent to Rome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki are en route for Rome when they find the murdered body of a lyre player named Maximus Pettulian. The Doctor is holding the man’s lyre when a centurion arrives and mistakes him for the dead man who is late for an engagement in Rome. The centurion accompanies them to Assisium. Once there, the centurion contacts the assassin Ascaris, who killed the real Pettulian, and instructs him to kill the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor overpowers the assassin and drives him away. The centurion has fled, and the Doctor concludes the soldier was in league with the assassin. He decides to maintain his alias as Pettulian and head to Rome. Barbara is already there and is sold to Tavius, who is highly placed in the court of the Emperor Nero. She is to be a handmaiden to Nero's second wife, the Empress Poppaea Sabina.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki arrive at Nero's court and encounter Tavius, who seems to imply to the Doctor that Pettulian is part of a secret network in which he is also a player. They find the body of the centurion who imperilled them earlier.\n\nIan has been confined to a galley in the Mediterranean but the craft runs into rough seas and is broken up. He is washed up on the nearby shore and found by another survivor of the galley, Delos. They agree to head for Rome in search of Barbara. When they arrive they are captured by centurions and taken to the arena to be trained as gladiators.\n\nIt becomes apparent to the Doctor that Tavius had the centurion murdered. Nero organizes a banquet in his honour at which he must play the lyre. He also takes a shine to Barbara much to the anger of Poppaea, who decides to have her poisoned at the Pettulian banquet. However, Vicki switches the poison goblet. Barbara has just left the banquet chamber when the Doctor arrives, warning Nero that \"his\" wine is poisoned.\n\nThe Doctor picks up his lyre with the warning that only those with the most sensitive and perceptive hearing will be able to discern its subtle melody. He then creates absolutely no sound but none wish to make themselves out to be philistines by not appreciating the music. Nero is not convinced and decides to have Pettulian fed to the lions.\n\nAt the arena Ian and Delos are set to fight each other. However, they decide to fight their way out of the arena; Ian shouts to Barbara that he will be back to rescue her. The Emperor calls off his soldiers, planning to have him killed when he returns to rescue Barbara.\n\nThe Doctor has found the architectural plans for Nero’s new Rome, and deduces that since the year is 64 AD that the Emperor is planning to destroy the city. Tavius arrives and warns the Doctor that the Emperor is planning to kill him too, advising him to complete his mission and kill Nero soon – Pettulian was an assassin all along. The Doctor accidentally sets fire to Nero's plans. Nero notices this and gets the idea for the Great Fire of Rome, thanks the Doctor and decides to spare his life. A rabble are bribed into starting the blaze and Ian is helped into the palace by Tavius, who reunites him with Barbara. Under Tavius' eye the two are allowed to escape and make their way back to the villa. The Doctor and Vicki also escape the city, watching it burn from a nearby hill. All four leave in the TARDIS but have barely begun to travel when a strange force starts dragging the ship to an unknown location.\n\nThis was the last story on which Mervyn Pinfield would serve as associate producer, although he would return to the series to direct \"The Space Museum\" and some of \"Galaxy 4\".\n\nBarry Jackson later played Garvey in \"Galaxy 4\" and \"Mission to the Unknown\" (1965). He also played Drax in \"The Armageddon Factor\" (1979). Edward Kelsey later played Resno in \"The Power of the Daleks\" (1966) and Edu in \"The Creature from the Pit\" (1979). Gertan Klauber later played Ola in \"The Macra Terror\" (1967). Kay Patrick later played Flower in \"The Savages\" (1966).\n\nThe BBC's test audience had a strong negative reaction to the story, complaining that it was unrealistic, \"so ridiculous that it's a bore\", and \"suitable only for morons\". Despite these criticisms, many later critics have praised the story's use of humour to contrast with the darker elements of the piece.\n\nOn the day of episode two's transmission, \"The Romans\" was praised as \"flawless\" by \"The Times\" newspaper's special correspondent on broadcasting, as part of a feature on children's television. \"The strongest weapon in the BBC armoury... remains \"Dr Who\",\" wrote the reviewer. \"The departure of the Daleks has broken tiny hearts all over the country, but the new series, with Miss Jacqueline Hill and Mr. William Russell in the hands of the slave traders, promises well. Miss Verity Lambert's production is once again flawless.\"\n\nRetrospective reviews have also been positive. In a 2008 review for \"Radio Times\", Mark Braxton praised Spooner's insertion of \"playful\" comedy into a story with dark elements, noting that the story was \"well-rounded and neatly structured\" even if it \"may not get it exactly right\". He also praised Hartnell's acting and his interactions with Vicki, as well as the moments between Ian and Barbara. Christopher Bahn of \"The A.V. Club\" noted that the story was less interested in historical accuracy but succeeded in comedy. He particularly praised the characterisation of the Doctor and Nero, who he felt was \"played to the hilt by Francis\" by balancing the character's darker and lighter sides. DVD Talk's Stuart Galbraith praised the serial for being ambitious and different, writing that it was \"unusual for its darkly humorous tone\". Den of Geek wrote that \"\"The Romans\" does comedy well\" with \"witty dialogue, character moments, slapstick, and drama\". \"Dreamwatch\" gave \"The Romans\" a score of 9 out of 10, calling it a \"genuine treasure\" in which Hartnell displayed his comedic side.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Donald Cotton, was published by Target Books in April 1987. It is unique among \"Doctor Who\" novelisations in that it is an epistolary novel, written in the form of transcripts of letters and ancient documents.\n\n\"The Romans\" was released on VHS with \"The Rescue\" on 5 September 1994. In May 2008, its soundtrack was released on Audio CD, with linking narration by William Russell. The story was released on DVD on 23 February 2009, again with \"The Rescue\".

The terms are used by cyclists and bicycle transportation planners in the United States. Generally, the minimum-width standard for a WOL in the US is 14 feet (4.3 m). A wide outside through lane (WOTL) is a WOL that is intended for use by through traffic.\n\nConversely, a narrow lane is a lane that is too narrow to be safely shared side by side by a bicycle and a motor vehicle. When the outside lane of a roadway is a narrow lane, it is sometimes referred as a \"narrow outside lane\" (NOL), \"narrow curb lane\" (NCL) or \"narrow outside through lane\" (NOTL).\n\nThe US Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration defines a \"Shared Lane\" as follows:\n\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the rules of the road apply differently for a cyclist when the roadway has a WOL or a NOL. For example, in the state of California all cyclists are legally required to ride \"as close as practicable to the right-hand\" side of the roadway when the lane is wide enough \"for a bicycle and a vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane.\" While California does not specify exactly what constitutes \"wide enough\", other states do. For example, the Texas version of this law states that riding \"as near as practicable to the right\" is not required when a variety of conditions are present, including when \"the person is operating a bicycle in an outside lane that is less than 14 feet in width\". Experts on vehicular cycling recommend that cyclists not share marked lanes that are not wide enough for efficient, safe, and lawful passing within the lane - that instead they should control such lanes (by riding in the middle) that are too narrow for safe side-by-side sharing by motor vehicle and bicycle both within the lane.\n\nWOLs are generally considered to be facilities which primarily benefit cyclists; for a road marked with a bike lane, if the bike-lane stripe is removed, what remains is a WOL. Some vehicular cyclists and bike lane opponents advocate for WOLs instead of bike lanes, arguing that WOLs provide most, if not all, of the benefits, without many of the perceived drawbacks that bike lanes impose on people travelling by bicycle. Still others maintain that the primary purpose of providing the additional roadway width—whether in the form of a WOL or a bike lane—is to facilitate the passing of cyclists by motorists.\n\n\n"}

White South African. Taylor was a qualified confectioner, he used to work at a local bakery in Johannesburg during the day before training at night.\n\nArnold Taylor made his professional boxing debut on 20 May 1967, against Ray Buttle, against whom he drew after six rounds in Transvaal. His first three fights were against Buttle; he won the Transvaal Bantamweight title with a ninth-round knockout of Buttle in his second fight, held on 30 June of the same year, at Johannesburg. On 11 December, he outpointed Buttle over eight rounds in a non-title bout, also at Johannesburg.\n\nOn 19 February 1968, he won the South African Bantamweight title; in only his fourth fight, beating Andries Steyn over twelve rounds by decision. After two non title wins, he lost the title, and suffered his first career defeat, when he was knocked out in the first round by Dennis Adams on 1 July of the same year.\n\nAfter that defeat, he had eight wins in a row, including three against Herby Clark (one by knockout, one by disqualification in six rounds and one by decision), and one each over Edward Mbongwa (on 7 September 1968, in what was his first fight abroad, fought in Swaziland) and one in Lesotho over Anthony Morodi. His third win over Clark, a twelve-round decision on 12 May 1969, actually gave him the South African Lightweight division, 15 pounds (about 1.1 stone) over his natural fighting weight.\n\nNext was a rematch with Adams. Taylor lost weight to fight Adams for the South African Featherweight title, and he avenged his first defeat, conquering his third regional title along the way, by knocking Adams out in round eight, exactly twelve days after conquering the Lightweight title. He decided to vacate the Featherweight title and concentrate on defending his Lightweight title, but he lost that title on his first defense, when rematched with Steyn, on 4 July 1969, by a knockout in round eight also.\n\nTwo wins and one defeat later, he fought Ray Buttle's brother, Mike Buttle, in a rematch for the South African Bantamweight title, on 6 December; he had beaten Mike Buttle by a fifth-round knockout three weeks before. The rematch lasted one more round, as Taylor regained the title with a sixth-round knockout.\n\nTaylor began the 1970s with an upgrade in opposition quality, when he fought fellow world Bantamweight champion Johnny Famechon, of Australia, on 11 April 1970, at Johannesburg. In his first fight against a former or future world champion, Taylot lost a ten-round decision. In his next fight, he faced Ray Buttle once again, this time winning again with a ninth-round knockout, on 15 August, to regain the South African Featherweight title. This began a streak of nineteen wins in a row, including five in Australia (where he lived for the first half of 1971), and one in Zimbabwe. After he had reached sixteen wins in a row, he was given his first world title shot.\n\nOn 3 November 1973, Taylor met the Lineal and WBA World Bantamweight champion, Mexico's Romeo Anaya, in a match refereed by Stanley Christodoulou. The fight is considered by many one of boxing's classic fights. One South African sportswriter called it \"the bloodiest fight in South African boxing history\". Taylor suffered a cut and was knocked down once in round five and three times in round eight (the WBA has since adopted a rule where a fighter is automatically declared a knockout loser if he or she is knocked down three times in the same round). Nevertheless, Taylor also cut the champion, and, in round fourteen, he connected with a right hand to Anaya's jaw, sending him to the floor. Feeling that this was his moment to become a world champion, Taylor screamed to his trainers: \"He's gone!\" from a neutral corner. It took Anaya two minutes to get up, and Taylor won the World Bantamweight crown.\n\nAfter two non title wins (including one over future Carlos Zarate challenger Paul Ferreri), Taylor defended his title for the only time, against Soo-Hwan Hong, on 3 July 1974, also at Durban. In what is also considered by many to be another boxing classic, Taylor was once again dropped four times. He was dropped three times early in the fight, and he staged a rally from rounds ten to fifteen, constantly pinning the challenger against the ring's corners and ropes, but he was dropped for a fourth time in round fourteen, and ended up losing the title by a fifteen-round unanimous decision.\n\nThe rest of his career was mostly undistinguished. He won four fights in a row, but, after losing two fights back to back, he decided to retire. Two fights that stand out among his last six fights were a rematch with Anaya, whom he beat again, by knockout in eight rounds at Johannesburg on 27 June 1975, and his last fight, when he was knocked out in eight rounds by Vernon Sollas, on 24 November 1976. His last two fights took place in Norway and England, respectively.\n\nTaylor died on 22 November 1981. While driving a motorcycle belonging to his eldest daughter Charmaine, he was involved in an accident in which he was knocked over and he died at the scene of the accident.\n\n\n"}

He was named after the great abolitionist and D.C. resident Frederick Douglass. Patterson was orphaned by the age of 2 when both of his parents died from tuberculosis. He then moved in with his sister Bessie, his primary caregiver, who sacrificed to ensure him a good education.

He was the only African American working at the Iowa State College veterinary clinic, where he learned important personal lessons about race and society. In his autobiography, reflecting on the experiences, he writes, \"I learned a lesson with regard to race that I never forgot: how people feel about you reflects the way you permit yourself to be treated. If you permit yourself to be treated differently, you are condemned to an unequal relationship.\" The same year Patterson received his Doctorate from Iowa State College in 1923, the College's first African American student athlete, Jack Trice, died from injuries sustained in a football game.\n\nHe earned a Doctorate of Philosophy in 1932 in Veterinary Pathology from Cornell University.\n\nPatterson taught veterinary medicine for four years at Virginia State College while serving as the Director of Agriculture. From there, he became head of the veterinary division, then the director of the School of Agriculture at the Tuskegee Institute.\n\nIn 1935, at the young age of 33, he had distinguished himself enough to be named the third President of Tuskegee Institute.\n\nAt Tuskegee Institute (between 1935-1953), President Patterson was responsible for transforming the Institute into a full-fledged university with graduate programs that exist to this day. Over the course of his Presidency he founded the School of Veterinary Medicine, the Commercial Dietetics program, and spearheaded the University's engineering and commercial aviation programs. All of these programs uniquely situated African Americans and Tuskegee University in a position where they could provide highly skilled interns for prestigious internships in emerging fields.\n\nIn 1944 founded two institutions which would largely shape his overall legacy: the School of Veterinary Medicine at Tuskegee University which has graduated approximately 75 percent of the United States' black veterinarians, and the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) which administers 37 private historically black colleges and universities throughout the United States and administers 10,000 scholarships every year. Today, UNCF has raised over $3.6 billion since its inception in 1944.\n\nDr. Patterson's leadership won him national recognition and earned him an invitation to serve on President Harry S. Truman's President's Commission on Higher Education from 1946-47. This commission called for an important shift in American college education away from European concepts, and towards equality of opportunity. Important developments flowing historically from this Commission's report were the development of the community college network and the Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nDr. Patterson eventually became a director of the Phelps-Stokes Fund from 1958-1969 where he worked to improve education for youth of all disadvantaged backgrounds. He also founded the nonprofit Robert R. Moton Memorial Institute to improve the recruitment and management processes of HBCUs.\n\nEventually, Dr. Patterson would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Ronald Reagan on June 23, 1987 in recognition of his lifetime of leadership and success in the educational field. He received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1986.\n\nIn honor of the profound impact Dr. Patterson had on college education, especially in the African American community, UNCF established the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute (FDPRI) in 1996. FDPRI is the nation's foremost research institution regarding educational issues facing African Americans from preschool to adulthood. Headquartered in Washington, DC within UNCF headquarters close to Howard University in the Shaw neighborhood of DC, the legacy of Dr. Frederick D. Patterson continues to live on.\n\nPatterson is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\n\n"}

He was, under the Reagan administration, cofounder of the National Endowment for Democracy in 1983. He served as the Archivist of the United States from February 16, 2005, until his resignation on December 19, 2008. After his resignation, he returned to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems as a senior strategist and was a visiting faculty member at the University of Maryland.\n\nThe son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Weinstein was born in New York City in 1937, the youngest of three children. His parents owned several delis in the Bronx and Queens. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and City College of New York, then received a Ph.D. in American studies from Yale University.\n\nHe taught at Smith College from 1966 to 1981. Briefly, in 1981, he served on the editorial staff for \"The Washington Post\" and was an Executive editor of \"The Washington Quarterly\" from 1981 to 1983. In 1981, he moved to Georgetown University, where he was a professor until 1984. In 1982, he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the UNESCO World Conference on Cultural Policies, and in 1983 he served on the U.S. delegation to the UNESCO-sponsored International Program for the Development of Communication. He was a Professor of History at Boston University from 1985 to 1989. In 2009, after he resigned from the position of Archivist of the United States, he taught history at the University of Maryland.\n\nDuring his career in education, Weinstein received two Senior Fulbright Lectureships, a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a fellowship at the American Council for Learned Societies.\n\nIn 1985 Weinstein founded The Center for Democracy, where he served as president until the organization merged with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) in 2003. At the request of Senators Lugar and Pell of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Center for Democracy organized a bipartisan group of election lawyers to oversee the preparations for the February 1986 elections in the Philippines. At Ronald Reagan's request, Weinstein returned to the Philippines to continue to monitor the election procedures. The Center drafted the official report of the U.S. Observer Delegation, and went on to work with President Aquino's government on matters of electoral procedure. While president he also chaired the organization's observation missions to El Salvador (1991), Nicaragua (1989–90, 1996), Panama (1988–89), and Russia (1991, 1996, 2000). After the organizations merged, Weinstein remained on staff at IFES as their senior adviser until he was selected as the Archivist of the United States. He returned to IFES in 2009.\n\nFor his work in international elections work, Weinstein received the United Nations Peace Medal (1986) and the Council of Europe's Silver Medal (1990 and 1996).\n\nWeinstein was a founding member in 1985 of the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of Peace and chairman of its education and training committee, remaining a director until 2001, and now serves on the chairman’s advisory council. He was a founding officer of the Strasbourg-based International Institute for Democracy from 1989 to 2001. He chaired the judging panel for the annual International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award from 1995 to 2003. He serves on the advisory council of the LBJ School of Public Affairs (University of Texas-Austin). He was chairman of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library's advisory council. He chaired the annual \"Global Panel\" in the Netherlands from 1993 to 1998. From 1982 to 1991 he was a member of the Foreign Policy Association's editorial advisory board.\n\nWeinstein died of pneumonia on June 18, 2015, aged 77, in a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, after suffering from Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn 1970, Weinstein began researching the Alger Hiss case for a book. Reviewing the case, John Ehrman wrote at the official CIA website that initially, Weinstein \"believed that Hiss had not been a Communist or a spy.\"\nWeinstein's extensive research included interviews with former Soviet intelligence officers who had worked with Chambers and a Freedom of Information request that eventually yielded 30,000 pages of FBI and CIA files. Ehrman continues \"Hiss also cooperated with Weinstein, granting him six interviews and access to the defense's legal files. After plowing through the data, however, Weinstein did what no previous Hiss defender had done: he changed his mind.\"\n\nControversy resulted when Weinstein indicated in a 1976 book review that he now believed that Hiss was guilty, and grew with the publication in 1978 of Weinstein's book, \"\". The book and the conclusions expressed in it have aroused some controversy; \"The Nation\" has since published a series of articles critical of Weinstein. In 1997, editor Victor Navasky published what he claimed as evidence that Weinstein had misquoted, misrepresented, or misconstrued several of his interview subjects for \"Perjury\". One of these subjects, Samuel Krieger, sued Weinstein for libel in 1979 for misquoting him and incorrectly identifying him as a fugitive murder suspect, leading Weinstein to settle out of court by issuing a public apology and paying Krieger $17,500.\nIn 2004, Jon Wiener accused Weinstein in \"The Nation\" of breaching professional ethics by paying for exclusive access to Soviet archives for his 1999 book \"The Haunted Wood\", and of refusing to allow other researchers access to his personal archives.\n\nOther sources, including Harvard professor Daniel Aaron, Sidney Hook, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin and Garry Wills, support Weinstein's scholarship. Ellen Schrecker has \"explicitly acknowledge[d] that the 1999 publication of Allen Weinstein's \"The Haunted Wood\" finally convinced me of the guilt of the major communist spies.\" In 2009, historian Eduard Mark wrote that \"The declassification of Venona excepted, no development since the end of the Cold War has affected the study of Soviet espionage in the United States as much as the work jointly written by Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, \"The Haunted Wood.\"\"\n\nIn his obituary, National Archivist David Ferriero noted the following achievements by Weinstein: \n\nAnother change at the Archives that Weinstein affected, albeit indirectly, was the creation of an anti-harassment policy by Ferriero in 2010, partially in response to complaints about Weinstein's conduct at the Archives. The policy was further codified and strengthened in 2013.\n\nIn 2018, it came to light that Weinstein's resignation from the National Archives was forced. An investigation by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found credible complaints of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or both from six female employees from 2005–2007. Weinstein's defense was that the medication he was taking for Parkinson's disease was at fault. Eventually, despite resistance from the White House Counsel, he agreed to resign, but the reasons why were not publicly disclosed until FOIA requests were made in 2017–2018. During his tenure as a professor at the University of Maryland afterward, according to anonymous sources quoted in an article in \"The Daily Beast\", Weinstein allegedly sexually assaulted a graduate student in 2010. The real reason for Weinstein's departure two weeks afterward was the administration firing him after hearing the complaint, rather than health reasons.\n\n\n"}

The only restriction placed on grammars for such languages is that no production maps a string to a shorter string. Thus no derivation of a string in a context-sensitive language can contain a sentential form longer than the string itself. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear-bounded automata and such grammars, no more tape than that occupied by the original string is necessary for the string to be recognized by the automaton.\n\nIn 1960, John Myhill introduced an automaton model today known as deterministic linear bounded automaton. In 1963, Peter S. Landweber proved that the languages accepted by deterministic LBAs are context-sensitive. In 1964, S.-Y. Kuroda introduced the more general model of (nondeterministic) linear bounded automata, noted that Landweber's proof also works for nondeterministic linear bounded automata, and showed that the languages accepted by them are precisely the context-sensitive languages.\n\nIn his seminal paper, Kuroda also stated two research challenges, which subsequently became famously known as the \"LBA problems\": The first LBA problem is whether the class of languages accepted by LBA is equal to the class of languages accepted by deterministic LBA. This problem can be phrased succinctly in the language of computational complexity theory as:\nThe second LBA problem is whether the class of languages accepted by LBA is closed under complement.\nAs observed already by Kuroda, a negative answer to the second LBA problem would imply a negative answer to the first problem. But the second LBA problem has an affirmative answer, which is implied by the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem proved 20 years after the problem was raised. As of today, the first LBA problem still remains open.\n\n"}

In jurisdictions such as the United States it is often practiced in conjunction with planning for pedestrians as a part of active transportation planning.\n\nIn 1970 in the United Kingdom, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation produced the .\nCycle networks of routes can be developed in co-ordination with maps.

After being fitted with a three row superheater at Swindon Works, it was allocated to Plymouth Laira. Its last shed allocation was to Cardiff East Dock, before it was withdrawn in December 1963, and sold to Woodham Brothers, Barry for scrap in May 1964.\n\nThe locations of 5972 on particular dates.\nWoodham Brothers sold the locomotive to David Smith and moved to Horbury railway works in Wakefield in May 1981. In 1994 it moved to Carnforth MPD for restoration, being steamed for the first time in 1998.\n\nIn the \"Harry Potter\" films, the locomotive is depicted pulling the \"Hogwarts Express\", a fictional train, made up of four (later five) British Rail Mark 1 carriages. Scenes were filmed at King's Cross railway station, the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway — along with internal scenes on board the train.\n\nWhen filmed, \"Olton Hall\" carried a \"Hogwarts Express\" headboard on the smokebox, featuring the Hogwarts school crest. The same emblem is featured as part of the \"Hogwarts Railways\" sigil on the tender and carriages. It retained its GWR number of 5972, but with alternative nameplates fitted, naming the engine \"Hogwarts Castle\". It is painted in a crimson livery — a non-standard colour, as GWR locomotives traditionally used green.\n\n\"Olton Hall\" was not the first locomotive to be re-liveried to appear hauling the Hogwarts Express. To promote the fourth Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", Southern Railway West Country Class locomotive 34027 \"Taw Valley\" was temporarily repainted and renamed. However, it was rejected by film director Chris Columbus as looking \"too modern\" for the film, but it carried the name and colour for some months afterwards.\n\nThe renaming as \"...Castle\" has become a railway preservation joke: \"...the Hall that thinks it's a Castle\"—the Great Western Railway Castle Class engines were different and larger.\n\nThree full-size replicas of the locomotive as 5972 \"Hogwarts Castle\" are at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Orlando Resort). Two as part of the Hogwarts Express train ride and the other is a static exhibit in the Hogsmeade area. There are also static models at the other \"Wizarding World of Harry Potter\" locations in Hollywood and Japan.\n\nIn 2015 the locomotive was put on static display at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter, near Watford, and will be displayed there until Warner Bros' lease on the locomotive from West Coast Railways expires.\n\n5972 is sometimes used for work other than its \"Hogwarts\" duties. In May 2009 it was moved temporarily to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, and in July 2009 it was based at Tyseley Locomotive Works for use on some of the regular \"Shakespeare Express\" trains run by Vintage Trains during the summer. It returned to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway during their annual Wizard's Weekend event in 2010. In late 2011 the locomotive was on static display in Hyde Park, London. In June–July 2014 it worked two final \"Wizards Express\" rail tours from Manchester to York before its mainline certificate expired.\n\nThe Hornby Railways model of the locomotive is actually a model of a Castle class locomotive, not a Hall. Tri-ang Hornby did release a model of the Hall class in 1966; however, this model was last offered in 1983 as 4930 \"Hagley Hall\", a preserved locomotive on the Severn Valley Railway. While Hornby (the successor to Tri-ang Hornby) may still have the moulds, they were modified some years ago to produce a Saint class replica. New tooling for a Hall has since been introduced and is available in the current Hornby range (see below).\n\nOther manufacturers have perpetuated this error, with Märklin using a Castle in its Hogwarts Express set. While Bachmann Branchline does produce models of the 'Hall' and 'Modified Hall' class locomotives, they have not offered one as 5972 \"Hogwarts Castle (\"Olton Hall\")\", though Bachmann USA released one in their range.\n\nIn 2015 Hornby introduced their model \"RailRoad GWR 4-6-0 'Olton Hall' 4900 Hall Class - R3169\", originally announced in 2012.\n\nIn 2019, Hornby announced a new Harry Potter range, comprising a range of Hogsmeade buildings based on the Goathland range from several years ago, and the Hogwarts Express set. Also available are 2 separate Hogwarts Castle locomotives with headlight, one being TTS Sound fitted. This is the first Hogwarts Castle model they have released being correctly of a Hall class.\n\n"}

{"id": "1811993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811993", "title": "Colorado River toad", "text": "Colorado River toad\n\nThe Colorado River toad (\"Incilius alvarius\"), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, is found in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Its toxin, as an exudate of glands within the skin, contains 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin.\n\nThe Colorado River toad can grow to about long and is the largest toad in the United States apart from the non-native cane toad (\"Rhinella marina\"). It has a smooth, leathery skin and is olive green or mottled brown in color. Just behind the large golden eye with horizontal pupil is a bulging kidney-shaped parotoid gland. Below this is a large circular pale green area which is the tympanum or ear drum. By the corner of the mouth there is a white wart and there are white glands on the legs. All these glands produce toxic secretions. Its call is described as, “a weak, low-pitched toot, lasting less than a second.”\n\nDogs that have attacked toads have suffered paralysis or even death. Raccoons have learned to pull a toad away from a pond by the back leg, turn it on its back and start feeding on its belly, a strategy that keeps the raccoon well away from the poison glands. Unlike other vertebrates, this amphibian obtains water mostly by osmotic absorption across its abdomen. Toads in the family bufonidae have a region of skin known as \"the seat patch\", which extends from mid abdomen to the hind legs and is specialized for rapid rehydration. Most of the rehydration is done through absorption of water from small pools or wet objects.\n\nThe Colorado River toad is found in the lower Colorado River and the Gila River catchment areas, in southeastern California, New Mexico, Mexico and much of southern Arizona. It lives in both desert and semi-arid areas throughout its range. It is semiaquatic and is often found in streams, near springs, in canals and drainage ditches, and under water troughs. The Colorado River toad is known to breed in artificial water bodies (e.g., flood control impoundments, reservoirs) and as a result, the distributions and breeding habitats of these species may have been recently altered in south central Arizona. It often makes its home in rodent burrows and is nocturnal.\n\nColorado River toad is sympatric with the spadefoot toad (\"Scaphiopus\" spp.), Great Plains toad (\"Anaxyrus cognatus\"), red-spotted toad (\"Anaxyrus punctatus\"), and Woodhouse's toad (\"Anaxyrus woodhousei\"). Like many other toads, they are active foragers and feed on invertebrates, lizards, small mammals, and amphibians. The most active season for toads is May–September, due to greater rainfalls (needed for breeding purposes). The age of \"I. alvarius\" ranges from 2 to 4 years within a population at Adobe Dam in Maricopa County, Arizona; however, other species in the toad family have a longer lifespan of 4 to 5 years. The taxonomic affinities of \"I. alvarius\" remain unclear, but immunologically, it is equally close to the \"boreas\" and \"valliceps\" groups.\n\nThe breeding season starts in May, when the rainy season begins, and can last up to August. Normally, 1–3 days after the rain is when toads begin to lay eggs in ponds, slow-moving streams, temporary pools or man-made structures that hold water. Eggs are 1.6 mm in diameter, 5–7 cm apart, and encased in a long single tube of jelly with a loose but distinct outline. The female toad can lay up to 8,000 eggs.\n\nThe toad's primary defense system are glands that produce a poison that may be potent enough to kill a grown dog. These parotoid glands also produce the 5-MeO-DMT and Bufotenin (which is named after the Bufo genus of toads); both of these chemicals belong to the family of hallucinogenic tryptamines. When vaporized, a single deep inhalation of the venom produces strong psychoactive effect within 15 seconds. After inhalation, the user usually experiences a warm sensation, euphoria, and strong visual and auditory hallucinations, due to 5-MeO-DMT's high affinity for the 5-HT and 5-HT serotonin receptor subtypes.\n\nBufotenin is a chemical constituent in the secretions and eggs of several species of toads belonging to the genus \"Bufo\", but the Colorado River toad (\"Incillius alvarius\") is the only toad species in which bufotenin is present in large enough quantities for a psychoactive effect. Extracts of toad secretion, containing bufotenin and other bioactive compounds, have been used in some traditional medicines such as \"ch’an su\" (probably derived from \"Bufo gargarizans\"), which has been used medicinally for centuries in China.\n\nThe toad was \"recurrently depicted in Mesoamerican art\", which some authors have interpreted as indicating that the effects of ingesting \"Bufo\" secretions have been known in Mesoamerica for many years; however, others doubt that this art provides sufficient \"ethnohistorical evidence\" to support the claim.\n\nIn addition to bufotenin, \"Bufo\" secretions also contain digoxin-like cardiac glycosides, and ingestion of the poison can be fatal. Ingestion of \"Bufo\" toad toxins and eggs by humans has resulted in several reported cases of poisoning, some of which resulted in death.\n\nContemporary reports indicate that bufotenin-containing toad toxins have been used as a street drug; that is, as a supposed aphrodisiac, ingested orally in the form of \"ch’an su\", and as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting \"Bufo\" toad secretion or dried \"Bufo\" skins. The use of \"chan'su\" and \"love stone\" (a related toad toxin preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the West Indies) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death. The practice of orally ingesting toad secretions has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention. Albert Most, founder of the Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of spiritual use of Colorado River Toads, published a booklet titled \"Bufo alvarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert\" in 1983 which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions.\n\nThe toads received national attention in 1994 after the \"New York Times Magazine\" published about a California teacher who became the first person to be arrested for possessing secretion of the toads. The substance concerned, bufotenin, had been outlawed in California since 1970.\nIn November 2007, a man in Kansas City, Missouri was discovered with an \"I. alvarius\" toad in his possession, and charged with possession of a controlled substance after they determined he intended to use its secretions for recreational purposes. In Arizona, one may legally bag up to 10 toads with a fishing license, but it could constitute a criminal violation if it can be shown that one is in possession of this toad with the intent to smoke its secretions.\n\nNone of the US states in which \"I. alvarius\" is (or was) indigenous – California, Arizona, and New Mexico – legally allows a person to remove the toad from the state. For example, the Arizona Game and Fish Department is clear about the law in Arizona: \"An individual shall not... export any live wildlife from the state; 3. Transport, possess, offer for sale, sell, sell as live bait, trade, give away, purchase, rent, lease, display, exhibit, propagate... within the state...\"\n\nIn California, \"I. alvarius\" has been designated as \"endangered\" and possession of this toad is illegal. \"It is unlawful to capture, collect, intentionally kill or injure, possess, purchase, propagate, sell, transport, import or export any native reptile or amphibian, or part thereof...\"\n\nIn New Mexico, this toad is listed as \"threatened\" and, again, taking \"I. alvarius\" is unlawful in that state.\n\n\n"}

Minakakis is of Greek descent.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Minakakis was invited by guitarist Ben Weinman, with whom he went to the same school, to form a hardcore punk group because he \"looked like a singer\" due to his imposing physique. In 1996, they founded the political-oriented act Arcane along with drummer Chris Pennie. In 1997, Arcane evolved into The Dillinger Escape Plan with the addition of bassist Adam Doll.\n\nBoth The Dillinger Escape Plan second EP, 1998's \"Under the Running Board\", and their 1999 debut album, \"Calculating Infinity\", developed a much faster and more technical approach to mathcore and became landmarks of that genre, being met with critical acclaim and exerting considerable influence in extreme music circles. Minakakis' lyrics on \"Calculating Infinity\" were based on failing relationships and human insecurity. He has stated that people \"always interpret them in weird ways\". Its album cover was taken from the inside tubes of an old record player from Minakakis' mother. The band's live shows became increasingly aggressive and reckless, with Minakakis starting to breathe fire. \"Calculating Infinity\" went on to sell over 100,000 copies, making Dillinger the best-selling band signed to Relapse Records at the time.\n\nIn 2001 and after tours in North America, Europe and Asia, Minakakis left the band on good terms to focus on his family life and began working full-time on graphic arts and design. Minakakis remains close with the other band members, including vocalist Greg Puciato.\n\nIn 2004, he laid out the cover artwork for the Dillinger album \"Miss Machine\". He went on to provide guest vocals on the track \"Fix Your Face\" on the 2007 Dillinger Escape Plan album \"Ire Works\" and joined them on occasion to perform it. He also created the artwork for the 2010 Dillinger Escape Plan album \"Option Paralysis\".\n\nOn December 28 and 29, 2017, Dimitri Minakakis joined The Dillinger Escape Plan for their last two shows at Terminal 5 in New York City.\n\nIn 2003, Minakakis founded and performed a yearlong stint with the defunct band Tokyo with former members of Knives Out from Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2011, Minakakis became a member of Argonauts along with members of Municipal Waste and Burnt by the Sun. In 2012, he left the band due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nMinakakis' vocal style consists almost entirely of screaming inspired directly from hardcore punk yells. His vocal delivery and also The Dillinger Escape Plan's music, particularly on their self-titled EP, have been compared to Tim Singer and his metallic hardcore band Deadguy. In a 2000 interview, Minakakis cited Rush, The Beatles and Faith No More as his biggest musical influences.\n\nAs a member\n\n\nAs a guest\n\n"}

{"id": "1812008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812008", "title": "RAPD", "text": "RAPD\n\nRAPD (pronounced as \"rapid\") stands for 'Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA'. It is a type of PCR, but the segments of DNA that are amplified are random. The scientist performing RAPD creates several arbitrary, short primers (8–12 nucleotides), then proceeds with the PCR using a large template of genomic DNA, hoping that fragments will amplify. By resolving the resulting patterns, a semi-unique profile can be gleaned from an RAPD reaction.\n\nNo knowledge of the DNA sequence of the targeted genome is required, as the primers will bind somewhere in the sequence, but it is not certain exactly where. This makes the method popular for comparing the DNA of biological systems that have not had the attention of the scientific community, or in a system in which relatively few DNA sequences are compared (it is not suitable for forming a cDNA databank). Because it relies on a large, intact DNA template sequence, it has some limitations in the use of degraded DNA samples. Its resolving power is much lower than targeted, species-specific DNA comparison methods, such as short tandem repeats. In recent years, RAPD has been used to characterize, and trace, the phylogeny of diverse plant and animal species.\n\nRAPD markers are decamer (10 nucleotides long) DNA fragments from PCR amplification of random segments of genomic DNA with a single primer of arbitrary nucleotide sequence and which are able to differentiate between genetically distinct individuals, although not necessarily in a reproducible way.\nIt is used to analyze the genetic diversity of an individual by using random primers. Due to problems in experiment reproducibility, many scientific journals do not accept experiments merely based on RAPDs anymore.\nRAPD requires only one primer for amplification.\n\nUnlike traditional PCR analysis, RAPD does not require any specific knowledge of the DNA sequence of the target organism: the identical 10-mer primers will or will not amplify a segment of DNA, depending on positions that are complementary to the primers' sequence. For example, no fragment is produced if primers annealed too far apart or 3' ends of the primers are not facing each other. Therefore, if a mutation has occurred in the template DNA at the site that was previously complementary to the primer, a PCR product will not be produced, resulting in a different pattern of amplified DNA segments on the gel.\n\n\n\n"}

Hepburn in particular drew sharp rebukes in the newspapers, many of which were penned by the same critics who loved her in \"The Warrior's Husband\".

The typical length is about 25–46 in (64–117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions.\n\nOn June 18, 2011, Nick Anderson of Greenville, North Carolina reeled in a 143-lb blue catfish from John Kerr Reservoir, more commonly known as Buggs Island Lake, on the Virginia-North Carolina border. On June 22, 2011, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries certified the blue catfish as the state's largest, setting a new state record. The fish had a length of 57 in (145 cm) and a girth of 47 in (120 cm).\n\nOn February 7, 2012, a 136-lb blue catfish was caught on a commercial-fishing trot line in Lake Moultrie, one of the two Santee Cooper lakes, near Cross, South Carolina. It was 56 inches long. The fish is the largest blue catfish ever weighed on a certified scale in South Carolina, but it is not eligible for state record certification because it was not caught on a rod and reel.\nOn July 20, 2010, a yet-to-be-certified new world record blue catfish was caught by Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, on the Missouri River. Greg's girlfriend, Janet Momphard, a nurse from St. Charles, helped land the world-record fish. The record catfish weighed in at 130 lb. It was 57 in long and 45 in around. The previous angling world record, 124 lb, was caught by Tim Pruitt on May 22, 2005, in the Mississippi River. This record broke the previous blue catfish record of 121.5 lb caught from Lake Texoma, Texas.\n\nExtreme angler Aron Puryear, while not catching the biggest, is thought to have caught the most blue catfish. He is rumored to have caught between 28,000 and 30,000 blue catfish. He is known as \"the blue cat collector\" and always practices catch and release.\n\nExtreme hand-lining expert Zachary Gustafson holds the record for hand-lining in a 107-lb blue catfish on 15-lb-test braided line. The catfish was pulled in on June 5, 2015 on the Potomac River. The record-setting catfish was pulled in using a sausage with a circle hook.\n\nThe Indiana record for a blue catfish was set in 1999 by Bruce Midkiff. The fish was caught in the Ohio River and weighed 104 lb.\nBlue catfish are often misidentified as channel catfish. Blue catfish are heavy bodied, blueish gray in color, and have a dorsal hump. The best way to tell the difference between a channel catfish and a blue catfish is to count the number of rays on the anal fin. A blue catfish has 30–36 rays, whereas a channel catfish has 25–29. Blue catfish also have barbels, a deeply forked tail, and a protruding upper jaw.\n\nBlue catfish are opportunistic predators and eat any species of fish they can catch, along with crawfish, freshwater mussels, frogs, and other readily available aquatic food sources. Catching their prey becomes all the more easy if it is already wounded or dead, and blue catfish are noted for feeding beneath marauding schools of striped bass in open water in reservoirs or feeding on wounded baitfish that have been washed through dam spillways or power-generation turbines. Blue catfish are one of the only species of fish in the Mississippi river basin able to eat adult Asian carp. \n\nThe ability of the blue catfish to tolerate a wide range of climates and brackish water has allowed it to thrive in Virginia's rivers, lakes, tributaries, and the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, the relatively low mortality rate, large body size, wide range of species preyed upon, and success as a predator has resulted in the blue catfish being considered a problematic invasive species in Virginia. Since their introduction in Virginia waters in the 1970s, blue catfish populations have exploded. Recent electrofishing studies have documented capture rates in excess of 6,000 fish/hr, whereas studies from the native range show peak electrofishing capture rates of 700 fish/hr. Clearly, blue catfish are a dominant species within the freshwater and oligohaline portions of Virginia's tidal rivers. The introduction of blue catfish in Virginia's tidal rivers was thought to have negative impacts on anadromous American shad, blueback herring, and alewife; however, predation of these species by blue catfish has been demonstrated to be minimal. Much of the narrative that has been built around the species as a dangerous apex predator in the Chesapeake Bay is simply not true. Researchers from Virginia Tech have found the species to be mostly herbivorous and omnivorous, with diets consisting largely of hydrilla and Asian clams, both of which are invasive to the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish do eat blue crabs with some regularity, which is problematic because blue crabs represent the most valuable fishery in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\n\n"}

(album)\n\nGot Live If You Want It! is an album of mostly live recordings by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 3 December 1966 by London Records in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful North American concert tour supporting their hit album \"Aftermath\" (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager Andrew Loog Oldham abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were overdubbed with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album – all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes its title from the Stones' 1965 UK-only live EP, whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 Slim Harpo recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American \"Billboard\" albums chart, although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP – pressed in limited quantities for the European market – became highly valued by record collectors. \"Got Live If You Want It!\" has been reissued twice by ABKCO Records, in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on SACD.\n\nIn 1966, the Rolling Stones' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their \"Aftermath\" LP and the singles \"Paint It, Black\" and \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during their North American tour in June and July proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police, who were tasked with controlling the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and the establishment seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, London Records, wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, \"Between the Buttons\" (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.\n\nThe original plan for the recording was to capture the Stones live on 23 September 1966 at the Royal Albert Hall – their first concert in the United Kingdom in a year. Several minutes into the show, however, the band's lead singer Mick Jagger was swarmed onstage by screaming girls from the audience, temporarily stopping the performance – the event was captured on video and featured in a documentary film. As a consequence, popular music acts were subsequently banned from performing at the Hall. According to the music journalist Fred Bronson, \"the concert drove home the Stones' unpopularity with members of the ruling class.\"\n\nThe Stones' producer and manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, abandoned the original idea in response to this \"collective hysteria generated by the group, especially among teenagers, which threatened to degenerate into rioting\", as Margotin and Guesdon describe. Instead, he decided to select concert recordings from other sources and two older studio tracks, later overdubbed with crowd noise, to pass for an entirely live album that would still credit the Royal Albert Hall as the recorded venue.\n\nThe recordings of \"Under My Thumb\", \"Get Off of My Cloud\", \"The Last Time\" and \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" were taken from the Stones' 1 October 1966 live performance at City Hall in Newcastle. Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by Long John Baldry, who had sung in Alexis Korner's London-based band Blues Incorporated alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 – Jagger, rhythm guitarist Brian Jones and drummer Charlie Watts. The Stones' concert at Colston Hall in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"Not Fade Away\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"Time Is on My Side\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer Glyn Johns used the IBC Mobile Unit, the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony. Keith Richards, the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record – the difference was light years apart.\"\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"Fortune Teller\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist Bill Wyman, both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".\n\nThe Rolling Stones conceived \"Got Live If You Want It!\"s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by Slim Harpo, one of the band's favourite blues musicians. The name was first used for a live EP of five songs, released on 11 June 1965 in the UK by the group's British label Decca Records and marketed as capturing \"the unadulterated in-person excitement of a Stones stage show\".\n\nThe album's front cover arrays several photos of the group performing live, shot by the photographer Gered Mankowitz, who had accompanied the band for two 1965 North American tours at their request. The original LP was issued with liner notes saying it had been recorded at the Royal Albert Hall during the Stones' Autumn 1966 tour of the UK with the Yardbirds and Ike and Tina Turner.\n\nLondon Records released \"Got Live If You Want It!\" on 3 December 1966 in the US on both mono and stereo LPs. In a 17 December issue, \"Billboard\" predicted the album would be a \"blockbuster\" and \"much in demand\", highlighting its inclusion of recent hit singles and a \"powerhouse\" performance of \"Under My Thumb\". It peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" albums chart, and on 19 January 1967, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of at least 500,000 copies to retailers. According to the music historian Richard Havers, the album \"stayed on the best-seller list for close to a year\".\n\n\"Got Live If You Want It!\" was meant to be released only for the North American market – Margotin and Guesdon suggest this is because Decca had already released an EP of the same name in the UK, while Bronson connects it to the aftermath of the Royal Albert Hall debacle. However, Decca still pressed copies of the LP for European countries outside of the UK, including a limited shipment of copies sold in Germany and Scandinavia. According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"because of the modest volume of sales\", the LP became among the most coveted of the Stones' records for collectors. The band, however, disapproved of \"Got Live If You Want It!\"s release and have since disowned it publicly, referring to \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert\" (1970) instead as their first live album.\n\nIn 1986, ABKCO Records remastered the Stones' catalog on CD under the supervision of Allen Klein, the label's founder and the Stones' former manager. \"Got Live If You Want It!\"s reissue was delayed at first when Klein had trouble locating original multi-track tapes. In August 2002, it was rereleased again by ABKCO, this time as a new remastered CD and SACD digipak. On this edition, \"Under My Thumb\" appears with a different introduction and take than the original LP.\n\nReviewing for \"Crawdaddy!\" in February 1967, Sandy Pearlman believed the Stones' had mastered their relationship with a live audience, rendering the crowd screams a conceptual element and \"an added instrumental dimension – an integral part of the music\". Overall, he found the performances \"sloppy\" but full of force and tension, translating well with the sounds of a wild concert atmosphere. According to the rock scholar Deena Weinstein, Pearlman's review is notable for employing one of the earliest uses of the term \"metal\" in rock criticism, albeit as a descriptor of the album's sound rather than as a genre. \"On this album the Stones go metal\", Pearlman claimed. \"Technology is in the saddle – as an ideal and as a method. A mechanically hysterical audience is matched to a mechanically hysterical sound.\" He highlighted the LP's \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" as an exemplar of this aesthetic:\n\nWriting in \"HiFi\" that same year, Peter Reilly was indifferent to the merits of the music and merely found the audio quality fair but \"echo-y\". The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"puritanical\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.\n\nDavid Dalton, in his 1972 biography on the band, considers \"Got Live If You Want It!\" in a series of Stones albums – including \"December's Children\" (1965), \"Aftermath\" and \"Between the Buttons\" – to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\". He calls this recording in particular \"incredibly speeded up\" and \"so out of time and out of tune but so filled with Stoned energy that it just transcended criticism\". However, according to \"Stereo Review\"s Steve Simels in 1977, the LP \"had the distinction of being the most poorly recorded live album in history\", until Jamaican musician Jimmy Cliff's 1976 \"In Concert\", also produced by Oldham. In regards to the 1986 ABKCO CD, Mark Moses of \"High Fidelity\" observes that \"considerable cleanup\" had been done to what \"has always been an embarrassment\" in the Stones' reputation as a live act, although this is not necessarily a good thing, as Jagger is further revealed to be \"annoyingly out-of-tune with the rest of the band\" on several cuts.\n\nLater reappraisals are also mixed. Reviewing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger approves of the album's concept but finds the resulting release to be disappointing for reasons that may or may not have been the fault of the production team – he cites the poor sound quality and the dubbing of artificial crowd noise onto a few studio recordings as filler. Unterberger concedes, however, that \"the album has its virtues as a historical document, with some extremely important caveats for anyone not old enough to recognise the inherent limitations in a live album of this vintage.\" Havers echoes his observation of \"the limitations\" as well as the \"fascinating glimpse\" offered into hearing the Stones live at the time. In \"Entertainment Weekly\", David Browne writes of the 2002 ABCKO CD, \"We fight to hear the band amid a barrage of crowd screams – yes, the Stones as teen idols – but the band still manages a biting 'Under My Thumb.'\" Margotin and Guesdon, in \"The Rolling Stones All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track\" (2016), acknowledge \"the screaming that blocked out the music\", but still consider the album \"a terrific document of the times, of the extraordinary, adrenaline-fueled, and often erotically charged relationship between the Stones and their fans\". Critic Tom Hull says of the record, \"All but their change-of-pace hit 'Lady Jane' are hard and sharp, including a couple of my favorites from the day. Lots of audience noise to remind you how popular they were.\" Greg Kot is more critical in \"MusicHound Rock\" (1999), feeling none of the Stones' live albums are worth hearing because they offer no improvements over the original studio recordings.\n\n\"Got Live If You Want It!\" is included in \"All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock\" (2007), as part of the book's list of key live albums from the classic rock era. In a 2017 list for \"Vulture\" ranking the Stones' best songs, David Marchese includes three from this album – \"Fortune Teller\" at number 339, \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\" at 271 and \"I'm Alright\" at 148 – and says of the latter, \"The rowdy garage-rock energy that the Stones generate on this Bo Diddley cover, from 1965, can still jurgle your nurgles.\"\n\nCredits are adapted from contributions listed in Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon's book \"All the Songs\".\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nTechnical team\n"}

Before dying Yao Cha requested that his son Yao Silian complete the work. Emperor Yang of Sui agreed to compilation of the text by Yao Silian. In the Tang, the compilation of the text was part of an initiative at the suggestion of Linghu Defen shortly after the founding of the Tang dynasty to compile a number of histories for the previous dynasties. Then, Yao Silian was ordered to complete the Book of Chen by Emperor Gaozu of Tang, who ordered other scholars to work on the Book of Liang. When those scholars did not complete their task, Yao Silian was again ordered to work on the text. The Book of Liang was finally compiled by Yao Silian under the supervision of Fang Xuanling and Wei Zheng in the Tang, incorporating at least some of the work of his predecessors.\n\nIt contains the history of the Liang dynasty, and various descriptions of countries to the east of China.

{"id": "1812074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812074", "title": "Hart House (University of Toronto)", "text": "Hart House (University of Toronto)\n\nHart House is a student activity centre at the University of Toronto. Established in 1919, it is one of the earliest North American student centres. Hart House was initiated and financed by Vincent Massey, an alumnus and benefactor of the university, and was named in honour of his grandfather, Hart Massey. The Collegiate Gothic-revival complex was the work of architect Henry Sproatt, who worked alongside decorator Alexander Scott Carter, and engineer Ernest Rolph, and subsequently designed the campanile at its southwestern corner, Soldiers' Tower.\n\nConceived as a place for cultural, intellectual and recreational functions alike, Hart House's facilities include a gymnasium, swimming pool, shooting range (presently used only for archery), theatre, art gallery, reading and sitting rooms, lounges and reception areas, offices, library, music rooms, conference and study rooms, restaurant and auditoriums.\n\nHart House is organized into standing committees composed of students and faculty, and is governed by a similarly composed board of stewards and the warden.\n\nIts overall design acquires a high degree of stylistic unity through the calm, monumental impression it creates. There are several contributing factors: the stress placed on masses rather than silhouettes, the horizontal lines and the reduction of picturesque motifs to a minimum.\n\nAs an undergraduate, Vincent Massey read history and English at Victoria University in the University of Toronto, and then completed graduate studies in history at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon his return to Canada, he sought to bring a unifying, communitarian spirit to the highly independent colleges of the University of Toronto, inspired by the social and recreational life that he observed at Oxford's colleges. Massey, who in 1908 had become a trustee of his family estate, offered to establish a structure devoted to extracurricular activities at the university, an idea that was embraced by the university's governors. The land on which the building exists was close to the McCaul's pond, which was buried along with Taddle Creek in 1886.\n\nWhen construction began in 1911, the trustees of the Massey estate had budgeted $300,000 for the project. Working without a master plan, Massey and his architect continued to adopt new ideas and expand existing ones as construction progressed. By the time of its completion in 1919, the cost of the building had soared to $2 million.\n\nHart House was built during the Gothic Revival era. Originally, Gothic architecture was associated with cathedrals. The Gothic cathedral was built at a large scale. When the style had first gained its momentum in England and France, the large churches were encrusted with decoration. This decoration depicted biblical events through images so that even the illiterate could dwell in the ideals of religion. Originally the church developed universities; the ideals that Hart House is intended to evoke are represented through its architectural forms just as biblical messages were demonstrated in Gothic churches. The building is made up of corridors flanked by rooms with high ceilings and sculptural detailing.\n\nMassey's donation stipulated that the building was to be used only by men, as he felt that a coeducational facility would ruin the sense of collegiality that he hoped to create. Beginning in the 1950s, this restriction created much controversy, as women demanded admission. Massey stood by his original conditions. After his death the Stewards and administrators of Hart House had Massey's deed of gift altered to allow women to become members. Since 1972, women have been able to fully participate in the House's activities.\n\nDuring John F. Kennedy's debate with Stephen Lewis at Hart House on 14 November 1957, Kennedy said \"I personally rather approve of keeping women out of these places.\" He also said, \"It's a pleasure to be in a country where women cannot mix in everywhere\" (ignoring the female students who picketed outside with signs proclaiming \"Unfair!\" and \"We want Kennedy!\").\n\nIt is evident that the exterior of the building was carefully sculpted in the mind of Henry Sproatt. Hart House is large in comparison to the buildings surrounding it such as Wycliffe College and the Stewart Observatory. In keeping with the Gothic form, the building is presented as larger in height than in width, which gives an even greater sense of grandeur to those standing at its base. From the exterior, a repetition of large windows can be seen along the northern and southern sides, matched with stout exterior protrusions accentuating the end of one section of the building and the beginning of another. The contours of the building are jagged, emphasizing the Gothic form and giving Hart House the profile of a true academic institution of that time period.\n\nA variety of intimate details can also be found in the interior. Below grade, backstage, at the rear wall of the theatre, there are scars formed by service ammunition, giving the building a sense of character. There are also elements forged into the walls of the building, like the first occupants of the house, who are remembered on the south façade, as well as carvings over the bay windows of the map room which depict the principal units that were stationed there during the war. The Great Hall holds another souvenir, inconsistent with the Gothic setting: one of the stone corbels has been carved to represent an officer cadet of 1916 in uniform, carrying his field pack and rifle.\n\nHart House is an example of Gothic Revival architecture as it is asymmetrical with pointed arches and windows, extensive ornamentation, steeply pitched roofs and a tall tower. It is also a late collegiate Gothic building because of its late erection date, 1919. The building consists of four wings around a quadrangle with a four-peaked tower extended from the south west corner. Although Hart House appears to be of masonry construction, it is actually structural steel and precast concrete with grey sandstone cladding. The roofs are barrel vaulted wood beams. Wood and stone are the main materials used in this building.\n\nThe majority of elements within Hart House hint at the Perpendicular style of Gothic architecture and thus generally line up in a row. Arches and vaults are the dominant structural form, however, there are parts of the building that employ lintels to create open spaces with flat ceilings (such as the East Common Room). The ceilings in the corridors and many rooms such as the Upper Gallery of the Great Hall are vaults with ridge ribs, but of particular emphasis is the treatment of the library ceiling that uses decorative Lierne ribs, which can also be seen in the entrance vaults. The general shape of the frontispieces and what appear to be Tudor-like archways mirror the shape of the chimney arches, while the decorative cinquefoil shapes used for the windows can also be seen in the woodwork of doors and trusses. The main entrance on the south side, the entrance on the west side, and the entire east wall is treated with a Perpendicular style parapet of battlements. The Gothic nature of the structure is emphasized through the structural systems, layout, and ornamentation, while the weight of stone is de-emphasized through its decoration, and its contrast with the thin stained-glass windows.\n\nClose to the Romanesque-building style, Gothic, or Gothic-revival style uses stone masonry to build. The use of rocky dark sandstone and limestone materials contrasted greatly with the smooth brick lining inside, the pointed-arch shape dominating the windows and doors and hallways. The porch is another Gothic-revival element that architect Henry Sproatt added, a protected space in front of the main entrances for people to hide in case of bad weather. The addition of decorated wooden arch-braces and ceilings act like an acoustical amplifier for the Hart House Orchestra.\n\nEven though the detail of the Gothic style is much simpler than the Romanesque style, it still has decorative stone and wood carvings inside and outside the building. On the south side of the building there is a line of miniature human head sculptures made out of stone near the top of the building. There are also stone lions and monkeys that are on the outside of the main doors one at each side. The arch braces on the flat roofs of the east hall ways have carved decorations on them. The windows have clover like decorations near the top. Even the school crest and motto is carved onto the façade of Hart House. These carvings are a beautiful addition aesthetically to the building.\n\n\"Hart House's system of governance is based on a commitment to collaborative and democratic decision-making.\" It is governed by the Board of Stewards, a deliberative body composed of the student secretaries of the standing committees of the House; a representative from the Finance Committee; the University of Toronto campus student governments; the chair of the Alumni Committee; a senior member from Recreational Athletics; the President of the University (or his/her designate); two appointees of the President; one appointee of the Governing Council; and the warden, who serves as the chief administrative officer of the house. The current warden is John F. Monahan, who succeeded Bruce Kidd in 2015. The Board of Stewards is responsible for the use of space in the house, approving the House's finances, and working with the warden to determine the strategic vision of Hart House. Students are a majority of the members of the Board of Stewards.\n\n\nThe Art Museum at the University of Toronto comprises the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery (Hart House) and the University of Toronto Art Centre (University College). Located just a few steps apart, the two galleries were federated in 2014 and began operating under a new visual identity as the Art Museum at the University of Toronto, one of the largest gallery spaces for visual art exhibitions and programming in Toronto.\n\nThe Art Museum features a collection of historical and contemporary Canadian art, dating from 1921 to the present. Exhibits focus on contemporary Canadian art in all media. The gallery also hosts film screenings, lectures and performance art.\n\nIn addition to its regular exhibitions, the gallery houses an art collection that is valued at over CDN $10 million.\n\nIn its 118th year, the Hart House Chess Club is one of The University of Toronto's oldest, most high profile and successful clubs. It meets every Friday from 4:30pm to 10pm in Hart House's Reading Room for casual and serious play. Players of all skill levels are welcome. The chess club offers lectures by some of Canada's leading players as well as CFC rated tournaments. The Toronto Chess Team has won the top title six times at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship.\n\nIn 1986, the University of Toronto Debating Union—a university-wide debating club dating back to the 1940s—approached the Hart House Debates Committee and came to an agreement that secured support for the Union from Hart House. The organization, renamed the Hart House Debating Club, has ever since been the primary speech and debating society at the University of Toronto open to all students from all colleges and campuses.\n\nSince its inception, the Hart House Debating Club has played host to leaders in every field, including heads of state, senior Cabinet officials, filmmakers, business leaders, activists, poets, policymakers, and philanthropists. Some of its most notable speakers include John F. Kennedy, Christopher Hitchens, Adrienne Clarkson, Noam Chomsky, John Turner, Brian Mulroney, John Tory, Margaret Atwood, Bob Rae, Elizabeth May, Bill Graham, Andrew Coyne, Margaret MacMillan, and Atom Egoyan.\n\nThe club has hosted dozens of prestigious tournaments, including the North American Debating Championship and the World Universities Debating Championship, the latter of which it has won twice: in 1981 and 2006.\n\nThis committee oversees many of the literary events that Hart House sponsors throughout the school year. These include the writing groups \"le mot juste\" and the Algonquin Square Table, as well as the \"Hart House Review\". The Literary and Library Committee regularly hosts a writer-in-residence who leads workshops and reviews students' writings. The committee also runs a library, located on the second floor of Hart House. It features a variety of books for in-house research and leisure reading, and often is the venue for public readings (also coordinated by the committee).\n\nThis committee oversees concerts and events of various types of music, including rock, reggae, and folk. The concerts are free for all members of the university community. Throughout the school year the committee organizes six to ten concerts. These events are a growing part of Hart House. The committee's aim is to bring the entire music community together from all campuses. Hart House also organizes open mics which are open to all. These events are considered a \"must see\" for all first year students.\n\nThe \"Hart House Review\" (\"HHR\") is a Canadian literary journal published by student members of Hart House at the University of Toronto and printed by Coach House Press. The magazine is best known for prose, poetry and photography contributed by emerging writers and artists in Canada. Rohinton Mistry, Camilla Gibb, Lynn Crosbie and similarly notable names in Canadian literature have been published in the \"HHR\". The review also hosts lecture and reading events that feature established and emerging figures in Canadian literature and publishing.\n\nThe Hart House Hancock Lecture is an annual public lecture series. Delivered by a lecturer chosen by a committee of students, staff and alumni, it generally takes place in late March in the Great Hall of Hart House. The series was launched in 2001, with the vision of establishing an annual public lecture in Hart House.\n\nThe lecturer for 2007 was McGill Professor Darin Barney, who delivered a lecture titled \"One Nation Under Google: Citizenship in the Technological Republic\" examining the relationship between technology and citizenship.\n\nThe lecturer for 2008 was Warchild Canada founder and U of T Professor Samantha Nutt lecturing on \"The world is Our Backyard: Individual Responsibility for a Global Society\". Dr. Nutt spoke about citizens' role as privileged North Americans and their ability to effect change in war-torn countries.\n\nOther past lecturers have included Michael Geist (2006), David Bornstein (2005), Jennifer Welsh, (2004), Alan Lightman (2002) and Pico Iyer (2001).\n\nCopies of some of the past lectures are available online.\n\nHart House Theatre is often referred to as the cradle of Canadian Theatre. Opening in November 1919, the Art Deco theatre on the University of Toronto's St. George campus quickly became a leader in the Canadian \"Little Theatre\" movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Hart House Theatre cultivated and featured some of the country's finest actors, directors, playwrights and designers of the Pre-World War II era, including Raymond Massey, Dora Mavor Moore, Lloyd Bochner, Lawren Harris, Arthur Lismer, Wayne and Shuster and Merrill Denison. After the war, Hart House Theatre, under the direction of Robert Gill, became an extracurricular student theatre and for twenty years turned out a new generation of stage professionals. William Hutt, Don Harron, Kate Reid, David Gardner, Arthur Hiller, Donald Sutherland, Norman Jewison and Lorne Michaels all got their start on the Hart House stage.\n\nBy the mid-1960s the theatre joined the world of academia with the creation of the Graduate Centre for Study of Drama. A new generation of students combined dramatic literature with practical theatre experience, and learned from and contributed to the vibrant Toronto theatre scene of the 1970s.\n\nToday Hart House Theatre is the focal point for the performing arts at the University of Toronto. With over a thousand students participating each year in its extra-curricular season of drama, dance, music and film, Hart House Theatre continues to influence each new generation. The performances are often well reviewed by art critics, and almost always sell out.\n\nSince 1976 the Hart House Orchestra (HHO) has provided an opportunity for members of the University of Toronto community with musical interest and training to fellowship and perform challenging symphonic works.\n\nThe orchestra is composed of 80 to 90 musicians. Membership is determined annually by audition. Auditions are open to university students at all levels of study, alumni, faculty, staff and Hart House senior members. In a typical season the HHO performs three concerts at home and one concert in another city in Ontario or Quebec. Organizational operations are run by a committee of nominated volunteer orchestra members.\n\nOn an annual basis the orchestra runs two concerto competitions, one internal (open to HHO membership) and one external (open to the community). The winning soloists perform with the orchestra in one of the concerts.\n\nThis popular club helps its members make movies through equipment rental and instruction, as well as group projects (such as the New Filmmaker's Project) and screenings. Atom Egoyan and Babak Payami made their first films using Hart House Film Board equipment. Since 2006 The Hart House Film Board has offered an extensive series of film training classes.\n\nThe captivating beauty of Hart House has made it a popular location for weddings, professional conferences and other events. Hart House also has a barbershop for students. Hart House also owns and manages a farm in the Caledon Hills on the ridge of the Niagara Escarpment. The farm has long been a popular retreat.\n\nSince 1919, nearly all dignitaries visiting Hart House signed its guest book. In 2007, the original leather-bound book finally ran out of pages and had to be replaced.\n\nThe first royal visitor to Hart House was Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, who played squash with students there in 1924. In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the campus and lunched at Hart House. Elizabeth II made the first of several visits as a princess in 1951.\n\nSeveral individuals have signed the guest book more than once during separate visits to Hart House. Notable visitors include:\n\n\n"}

MSM was founded on March 1, 1999.\n\nThe leader of the party, Juan del Granado, was the mayor of La Paz from 2000 to 2010. The party won mayoral elections in 2010 in both La Paz and Oruro.\nMSM entered into a political alliance with the Movement for Socialism (MAS-IPSP) on September 3, 2005 in advance of the 2005 presidential election. The parties also consolidated their efforts during the 2006 election for the Constituent Assembly, in support of President Evo Morales during the 2008 recall referendum, and finally in a joint legislative slate in the 2009 general election.\n\nFour members of MSM were elected to serve in the lower house of Bolivia's Congress when the party was in alliance with the MAS-IPSP: Javier Zavaleta, Marcela Revollo, Fabián Yaksic, and Samuel Pamuri. The last three of those were elected to uninominal seats. As part of a break between the MSM and its ally the Movement for Socialism (MAS-IPSP), the party's four deputies, elected on the MAS slate left the MAS ranks and pledged in late March 2010, \"to act in accord with our political identity, with our conscience, and with the people who elected us with their vote.\" However, Samuel Pamuri quickly pledged his allegiance to the MAS-IPSP by April 2010. Javier Zavaleta distanced himself from the Movement without Fear as well, culminating in his formal detachment in February 2011.\n\nMAS-IPSP deputies have repeatedly threatened to remove the remaining deputies from their seats for non-adherence to their elected slate. In January 2012, the Movement without Fear proposed that the five uninominal seats representing the city of La Paz (including Zavaleta, Revollo, Yaksic, and Pamuri, as well as Guillermo Torres of the MAS-IPSP) be subjected to a recall referendum, thereby confirming or rejecting their current party allegiances.\n\nIn the departmental and municipal elections on 4 April 2010, the MSM participated in 176 contests, winning the mayor's office in 21 municipalities. Luis Revilla won the municipality of La Paz, which marked the third time that the Movement without Fear has won a mayoral race. Also, Rossío Pimentel Flores, from the MSM, carried the municipality of Oruro, something unexpected, since the Movement towards Socialism has enjoyed strong support from that city. The MSM has consolidated itself since then strongly in opposition to the ruling party.\n\nAfter President Evo Morales suggested he would run for re-election in 2014, Juan del Granado, the leader of the Movement without Fear, led the party to challenge its former ally, the Movement towards Socialism, to submit Morales' proposal to a constitutional referendum. Simultaneously, del Granado stated that the MSM would present a candidate for president. On November 11, 2013, the MSM nominated del Granado as its candidate for president in the 2014 elections.\n"}

It followed the adventures of a spider, the protagonist, and a young boy (however, the boy was only present in eleven of the thirteen episodes).\n\nThe stories were told through song, and performed by Jeff Stevenson with his children, Casey and Holly, singing backing vocals.\n\nThe styles of music featured in the episodes vary from rock 'n roll to haunting and melancholic, and were produced by Rick Cassman at Triple X Studios. A BBC video entitled \"Spider! – I'm Only Scary 'cos I'm Hairy!\" (BBCV 4753), which contained all thirteen episodes, was also released in 1992 (now out of print). However, it was later rereleased on DVD in 2004.\n\n\"Spider\" was generally well-received by critics and viewers, with praise directed to the series' simple animation, music, humour and multi-generational appeal. \"Spider!\" has gained an 8.2 rating from 44 IMDb users as of November 2016. \"Spider\" has now attracted a cult following on old children's videos and DVDs. Various episodes have also been uploaded to video networking sites like YouTube and Veoh.\n\nThe series has been repeated on various children's television channels in the United Kingdom, such as CBeebies and Nick Jr. It was also dubbed into Scottish Gaelic as \"Damhan Allaidh\", and shown on BBC Two Scotland in the mornings. In the United States, the series was broadcast in 1993, with American voice actors on PBS Kids, and repeated until 1997.\n\nIn Australia, the series was played on the ABC for two years from 1993 to 1994 and then on digital television on ABC2 from 2005 to 2006. In Namibia, the series was shown on NBC, and first aired on the network in 1992, as part of its lineup of children's programmes during the holidays.\n\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast on cable television on its networks for Knowledge Network in British Columbia and YTV (as part of \"YTV Jr.\") in all states and territories and on digital television on BBC Kids. In New Zealand, the series aired on the defunct channel TVNZ 6 as part of \"Kidzone\", a block for preschoolers. The series has also been sold to Hong Kong and was screened on ATV.\n\nThere were also two pop-up books, based on the first and tenth episodes, adapted from Richard Warner's original songs by Ron van der Meer and illustrated by the director Graham Ralph.\n\nA brief spoof of the series appeared as a three sketchs in an 1991 episode of \"Children's ITV\"'s \"Round the Bend\" - the three sketches showed Spider, with the simplistic animation exaggerated in a very sketchy style, up to various nefarious deeds such as stealing sweets, then disappearing and leaving his (unnamed) boy friend to take the blame. At the end of the final sketch, the unnamed boy finally has enough and squashes Spider with a rolled up newspaper.\n\nOn 12 May 2005, Silver Fox Films announced it was developing a new, revived version of the series entitled \"Spider's Silly Show\". The format was to be extended from five minutes to eleven minutes, and fifty two episodes were planned. It was to be presented by Andrew Sachs, who had previously narrated \"William's Wish Wellingtons\" for Hibbert Ralph Entertainment.\n\nHowever, the project appears to have been abandoned, as the latest information on it dates from 2005, and it has still not appeared on television.\n\nThe first twelve episodes were all broadcast on BBC One as part of the Children's BBC strand on Thursdays at 3:50pm (a puppet spider named \"Ninja\" also joined Simon Parkin, Andi Peters and Edd the Duck in \"The Broom Cupboard\" during the original run), but the first programme of 21 November 1991 was \"Ready, Teddy, Go!\" (a lead up to the year's telethon of \"Pudsey\"), so\nthe ninth episode was not transmitted until 28 November (the ninth episode of Ragdoll Productions' \"Brum\" was also not broadcast until that day as well).\n\nThe last Thursday of the year was 26 December, Boxing Day, so the thirteenth and final episode was not broadcast until four days after it, on Monday 30 December at 4:05pm.\n\nIn addition to being repeated by itself onwards from 1992, the series was also repeated as part of \"Ants in Your Pants\" (which was hosted by Edd the Duck's second replacement after \"Ratz\", Otis the Aardvark) in 1995, and the chorus of the first episode could also be heard in \"EastEnders\" episodes from this time period during scenes where children of Walford sat in front of a television.\n"}

{"id": "1812085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812085", "title": "Seth Bullock", "text": "Seth Bullock\n\nSeth Bullock (July 23, 1849 – September 23, 1919) was a Canadian-American frontiersman, business proprietor, politician, sheriff, and U.S. Marshal. He was a prominent citizen in Deadwood, South Dakota, where he lived from 1876 until his death, operating a hardware store and later a large hotel, the Bullock Hotel.\n\nMany of the details of Bullock's early life are lost. He was born in Amherstburg, Canada West (now Ontario) on the Canadian side of the Detroit River.\n\nHis father, retired British Army Sergeant Major and hero George Bullock, was known to be active in the politics of Sandwich, Upper Canada (later renamed Windsor, Ontario). He has been mistakenly believed to be related to British General Sir George Bullock, who was actually younger than Seth. Seth's mother was a Scotswoman named Anna Findley Bullock.\n\nBy 1860, Bullock's father, George Bullock, was forced to resign his position as County Treasurer due to missing funds. To avoid prosecution in Canada, Bullock's father fled across the border to Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., leaving his eight children alone in Sandwich, Ontario, Canada. Bullock's mother had died during this time, so the children were left to take care of themselves. And, the property owned by Bullock's father in Sandwich was either seized by his creditors or sold at public auction in 1863, as he had defaulted on his mortgage and other debt obligations.\n\nBullock's childhood was not a happy one. His father was a strict disciplinarian, known to beat young Seth for minor infractions. Bullock ran away first at age 13, then again at age 16 to Montana to live temporarily with his older sister, Jessie Bullock. By age 18, he had permanently left home.\n\nIn 1867, Bullock became a resident of Helena, Montana, where he unsuccessfully ran for the Territorial Legislature. He was subsequently elected as a Republican to the Territorial Senate, served in 1871 and 1872, and helped create Yellowstone National Park. \n\nIn 1873, he was elected sheriff of Lewis and Clark County, Montana. During his tenure as sheriff, he killed his first man, Clell Watson. Watson had stolen a horse and engaged in a gunfight with Bullock, in which Bullock was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Watson was then taken into custody. \n\nWatson was prepared to be hanged, but a mob appeared and scared off the executioner. Bullock climbed the scaffold and pulled the lever, sending Watson to his death. Bullock then held off the mob with a shotgun. This incident was recreated in the pilot episode of HBO's television series \"Deadwood\", except in the show Watson was hanged on the front step of the sheriff's office.\n\nSoon after this event, Bullock and Sol Star opened a hardware store. In August 1876, they decided that an untapped market for hardware existed in the gold rush town of Deadwood, in the Dakota Territory. The two purchased a lot in Deadwood and set up shop there as the \"Office of Star and Bullock, Auctioneers and Commission Merchants,\" first in a tent and then a building.\n\nDeadwood was a lawless, rowdy camp. The day after Bullock's arrival, Wild Bill Hickok was murdered by Jack McCall. McCall shot Hickok in the back of the head while he sat playing poker. McCall was later found not guilty by an impromptu camp court and released, after which he promptly left town. The demand for law enforcement grew following Hickok's murder and Bullock's background made him the logical choice for Deadwood's first sheriff. However, he was not elected to the position, but rather was appointed by then Governor Pennington of Dakota Territory in March 1877 In November 1877, a special election was held in Lawrence County of which Deadwood was located. Bullock was the candidate for sheriff on the Peoples Party (Republican) ticket, and John J. Manning was the candidate for the Democratic Party. Manning won the election, thereby becoming the first elected sheriff for Lawrence County of which the main city was Deadwood. Bullock's tenure as appointed sheriff lasted approximately nine months. In 1878, Bullock again ran for sheriff of Lawrence County on the Republican ticket, and faced incumbent John Manning. As was the case in 1877, Manning won the election against Bullock, and was awarded a two-year term as sheriff.\n\nDuring his tenure as the appointed sheriff, Bullock took his job seriously, deputizing several residents and tackling the job of civilizing the camp. Despite (or perhaps because of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel. Swearengen had a knack for making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.\n\nBullock was appointed Marshal in 1905 by Teddy Roosevelt and again in 1909 by Howard Taft. When appointed sheriff, one of Bullock's first duties was to confront Dodge City Deputy Marshal Wyatt Earp, who was possibly interested in the sheriff's job. Bullock told Earp that his services were not needed. A week later Earp left Deadwood to return to Dodge City.\n\nHaving attained some stability in Deadwood, Bullock brought his wife Martha Eccles Bullock and daughter, Margaret, to town from her parents' home in Michigan, where they had been living during this period. They subsequently had another daughter, Florence, and a son, Stanley.\n\nBullock and Star purchased a ranch where Redwater Creek met the Belle Fourche River and dubbed it the S&B Ranch Company. Bullock is also credited with introducing alfalfa farming to South Dakota in 1881. Later he became a deputy U.S. Marshal, partnered with Star and Harris Franklin in the Deadwood Flouring Mill, and invested in mining, the local growth industry. Bullock and Star eventually expanded their business interests to the towns of Spearfish, Sturgis, and Custer.\n\nBullock, then a deputy sheriff from Medora, North Dakota, met Theodore Roosevelt in 1884 while bringing a horse thief known as Crazy Steve into custody on the range, near what would become the town of Belle Fourche. The two became lifelong friends, Roosevelt later saying of Bullock, \"Seth Bullock is a true Westerner, the finest type of frontiersman.\"\n\nBullock and Star contributed further to the economic development of the region by convincing the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad to build a track by offering them 40 acres (16 ha) of free right-of-way across their land when a speculator purchased the right of way to Minnesela and demanded a high price from the railroad. The railroad built a station three miles (5 km) northwest of Minnesela in 1890, and Bullock and Star were instrumental in founding the town of Belle Fourche, offering free lots to anyone moving from Minnesela. Belle Fourche became the largest railhead for livestock in the United States and the county seat was changed from Minnesela to Belle Fourche.\n\nBullock and Star's hardware store in Deadwood burned down in 1894. Rather than rebuild, they built Deadwood's first hotel on the site—a three-story, 63-room luxury hotel. The Bullock Hotel continues to operate to this day, now incorporating a casino.\n\nBullock's friendship with Roosevelt led to his becoming a Captain of Troop A in Grigsby's Cowboy Regiment. This was another volunteer cavalry regiment which Congress authorized in the Spring of 1898. It was similar in composition to Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, which saw action in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Although Troop A never left training camp in Louisiana before the war ended, Bullock earned the rank of captain. When Roosevelt became vice president under President William McKinley, he appointed Bullock as the first forest supervisor of the Black Hills Reserve. After Roosevelt was elected president, Bullock organized 50 people (including Tom Mix) to ride in the inaugural parade in 1905. Bullock was then appointed U.S. Marshal for South Dakota for the next nine years. Roosevelt later selected Bullock as one of 18 officers (others included Frederick Russell Burnham, James R. Garfield, and John M. Parker) to raise a volunteer infantry division, Roosevelt's World War I volunteers, for service in France in 1917.\n\nCongress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders; however, as commander-in-chief, President Woodrow Wilson refused to use the volunteers, and the unit was disbanded. After Roosevelt's death in January 1919, Bullock created a monument to him with the aid of the Black Hill Pioneers, dedicated on July 4, 1919, on Sheep Mountain, which was renamed Mount Roosevelt.\n\nBullock died of colon cancer shortly thereafter, on September 23, 1919, at his home at 28 Van Buren Street in Deadwood. He is buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Deadwood, along with Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, with his grave facing Mount Roosevelt. Bullock's grave is more than 750 feet away from the main cemetery grounds.\n\nSeth Bullock was portrayed by Timothy Olyphant in HBO's critically acclaimed TV series \"Deadwood\" (2004–06). Olyphant reprised the role for the HBO sequel \"\" (2019).\n\n"}

{"id": "1812092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812092", "title": "Christian Democratic Party (Bolivia)", "text": "Christian Democratic Party (Bolivia)\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party (, PDC) is a Christian-democratic political party in Bolivia.\n\nFounded on 6 February 1954, as Social Christian Party (Spanish: \"Partido Social Cristiano\", PSC), and assumed its present name at a party congress in November 1964. Its intellectual foundations were study centres of the Church's social doctrine, the Bolivian Catholic Action and “Integral Humanism” (a centre for the study of the philosophy of Jacques Maritain). It remains a conventionally “tercerista” Party, calling for a “third way” between capitalism and socialism – a way that would be more humane and truly democratic than either competing social-political system. Founded by Remo Di Natale, Benjamín Miguel Harb, Javier Caballero, and Emanuel Andrade.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party took part in the 1958 and 1962 congressional elections, in 1962 Benjamín Miguel Harb became its first deputy. It boycotted the 1964 and 1966 presidential votes.\nIn 1967, the party took part in the Government of the President of René Barrientos Ortuño, being given responsibility for the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and this was a major misjudgment by the PDC leadership. When military forces carried out bloody raids against mining camps, the Christian Democratic Party was forced to withdraw in anger and embarrassment, with severe internal divisions resulting. The party's youth organization had been discontented with the third-road philosophy for some time, and the mine camp invasions helped to crystallize their rebellion; they favored revolutionary socialism as a solution to Bolivia's dilemmas. In the late 1960s, the youth wing seceded to form the Revolutionary PDC which later became the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Several discontented members of the party, including Jose Luis Roca Garcia, also left to join General Alfredo Ovando Candía's short-lived nationalist revolutionary government in 1969–1970.\n\nUnder the dictatorship of President Hugo Banzer Suárez the Christian Democratics fought for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the holding of elections, but its president Benjamín Miguel Harb was exiled in 1974 and its organizing secretary Felix Vargas forced to leave the country shortly afterwards.\nThe PDC took part in 1978 general elections, running former Defense Minister General René Bernal Escalante, a leader of the right-wing faction of which supported the Hugo Banzer Suárez regime. After the 1978 election, René Bernal Escalante split from the PDC and founded the Christian Democratic Union.\n\nFor the elections held on 1 July 1979, the party joined the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement-Alliance with four other parties – the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), the Authentic Revolutionary Party (PRA), the Marxist Leninist Communist Party (PCML) and the Tupaj Katari Revolutionary Movement (MRTK). The Alliance ran a MNR’s leader Víctor Paz Estenssoro as its Presidential candidate and a PDC’s leader Luis Ossio Sanjines as its Vice-Presidential candidate. In 1979 the Christian Democratic Party won nine seats in the Chamber of Deputies and three in the Senate.\n\nIn 1980 the PDC took part in an electoral coalition Democratic Revolutionary Front-New Alternative backing ex-President Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas, which polled few votes; the leader of the PDC Benjamín Miguel Harb ran as Vice-Presidential candidate.\n\nSoon after the restoration of democratic government, in November 1982, Christian Democratics took a seat in the Hernán Siles Zuazo Government, but withdrew from the coalition in October 1984.\n\nThe PDC took part in 1985 general elections, running Luis Ossio Sanjines as its presidential candidate and Jaime Ponce García as vice-presidential candidate, and won three seats in the Chamber of Deputies.\nAlthough winning no legislative seats as an ally of the Nationalist Democratic Action in May 1989, Luis Ossio Sanjines, was elected Vice-President of the Republic as a result of its adherence to the Nationalist Democratic Action – Revolutionary Left Movement pact (Patriotic Agreement) in August. The PDC campaigned as a member of the Patriotic Agreement in 1993 elections. The Christian Democratic Party was one of the founding components of Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), for which it provided its electoral registration. Following the 2005 election, this alliance led the parliamentary opposition to President Evo Morales.\n"}

He served as Prime Minister of the puppet government of the German-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from 27 April 1939 to 27 September 1941, but maintained contact with the government-in-exile. Because of his participation in the anti-Nazi resistance, he was the only head of government to be murdered by the Nazis during the war.\n\nAntonin Eliáš graduated in geodesy from the Czech Technical University in 1911. Working for a private company as a land surveyor he was sent to Bosnia to work on the construction of a railway.\n\nAfter the declaration of war on Serbia Eliáš was obliged to join the Austro-Hungarian Army, and was sent with the Prague 28th Infantry Regiment to the Russian Front. After only a few days at the front Eliáš was taken prisoner on 28 August 1914 in Galicia .\n\nIn 1917 Eliáš learnt of the existence of Czechoslovak Legions and joined them. The Czechoslovak Legions were volunteer armed forces fighting with the Entente Powers during World War I (France, Britain, Italy, Russia). Their goal was to win the Allies' support for independence, in which they were ultimately successful.\n\nEliáš was later dispatched to France, where he studied at the officer school at St Maixent, and was later assigned to the 21st Czechoslovak Regiment as a platoon commander.\n\nIn the autumn of 1918 he took part in battles at Terron and on the Aisne. For his bravery and command skills, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre (Cross of War) and a made a member of the Legion of Honour.\n\nHis studies in France significantly accelerated Eliáš' career after the war. In Prague Eliáš became a general staff officer, later being promoted to Brigadier General.\n\nAs a military expert he was a member of the Czechoslovak delegation at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. In 1936 he was promoted to General of Division (the second highest army rank) and became commander of the Vth Army Corps in Trenčín.\n\nDuring the Second Czechoslovak Republic he was appointed Minister of Transportation and member of the Supreme State Defence Council of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe first government under the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was only provisional, serving as a successor to the government of the Second Czechoslovak Republic during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Its replacement was discussed at the end of April 1939, with President Emil Hácha thinking Alois Eliáš would be a good choice for prime minister, because the popularity he had acquired during his earlier military career would legitimise the puppet regime. Eliáš had served with the Czechoslovak Legion in France during World War I, and attained the rank of general. Although somewhat dubious, some historians (who?) have written that Hácha hoped Eliáš's former contacts with Reichsprotektor Konstantin von Neurath could influence the Reichsprotektor on the desirability of Eliáš as Prime Minister.\n\nOn 11 May 1939, Eliáš proposed that Jews would be deprived of Protectorate citizenship and subject to various discriminatory measures.\n\nEliáš maintained contacts with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile led by President Edvard Beneš. His situation started to deteriorate after a wave of arrests of resistance members in 1940. Among Eliáš' close contacts, the government minister fled to London, while the Lord Mayor of Prague, , who was well informed about Eliáš's activities in support of families of exiled and arrested Czechs and secret messengers and contacts with Czech president Edvard Beneš in exile, was arrested and later executed. By January 1941, the Gestapo had accumulated damning evidence of Eliáš' involvement in the resistance. SS and Police Leader Karl Hermann Frank called for his arrest, but was unsuccessful in having Eliáš removed.\n\nIn early September 1941, Alois Eliáš lost patience with several collaborationist journalists. Eliáš officially invited them to the Office of the Government, planning to poison them. With the help of his urologist Miloš Klika, sandwiches were laced with botulism toxin, tuberculosis-causing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and typhus-causing Rickettsia bacteria. On 18 September 1941 the invited journalists ate the poisoned sandwiches. Karel Lažnovský, the pro-Nazi editor of the journal \"České slovo\", was the only fatality. Other journalists, including Jaroslav Křemen and Emanuel Vajtauer, fell ill. Although Eliáš handled the sandwiches, he did not fall ill. Though the Sandwich affair was investigated by the Gestapo, Eliáš was not charged and remained in office.\n\nOn 27 September 1941, two days before the appointment of Heydrich as the new Reich Protektor (German governor of Czech Lands), Eliáš was arrested, put on trial and sentenced to death. Eliáš was executed at the Kobylisy Shooting Range on 19 June 1942. During Eliáš' time on death row, Heydrich himself was assassinated by the Czech resistance.\n\nIt was over 60 years later that prime minister Eliáš was given a state funeral with full honours on 7 May 2006 and was buried at the National Monument in Vitkov in Prague.\n\n\n"}

Population: \n\nIt was founded in 1870 as a military post. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, it was transferred to Japanese control, along with the rest of southern Sakhalin, under the Treaty of Portsmouth. The Japanese renamed it Maoka (), translating roughly as \"True Hill\".\n\nOn August 20, 1945, a combined marine battalion and the 113th infantry brigade landed in Port Maoka. They were preceded by a group of scouts, landed secretively by submarine Sh-118, in the Maoka area to successfully complete their task. However, Japanese resistance was desperate, and the landing party had to fight particularly fiercely. Japanese fire set one of the coastguard vessels on fire, to which the Russian response was intense naval bombardment of the town, causing more civilian deaths.

{"id": "1812127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812127", "title": "Role reversal", "text": "Role reversal\n\nRole reversal is one of the psychodrama techniques that demonstrate a protagonist's intrapersonal conflicts deeply and explicitly on the stage. This technique is perhaps the single most important and effective technique in psychodrama. In the form of psychodrama, the protagonist is invited to move out of his own position or role into the significant other's position and enact that role. Therefore, the auxiliary ego can observe and learn how to play the role. For example, in a parent-child's session, a protagonist who is the child reverses role with one of his or her parents. This technique not only helps the protagonist get more insight of a specific role but also helps the director, the auxiliary egos, and the audience learn more about that specific role.\n\nPsychodrama has three important techniques: the technique of doubling, the technique of mirroring, and the technique of role reversal. Each technique represents different stages in Moreno's theory of the development of the infant: the stage of identity (the stage of doubling), the stage of the recognition of the self (the stage of mirroring), and the stage of the recognition of the other (the stage of role reversal). Role reversal requires that one has learned to differentiate in the areas of time, place and person, and is capable of moving out of his own position into another's position to be able to enact that other role.\n\nRole reversal involves the changing of positions between the protagonist and his significant other, such as family members, friends, or people in school or in workplace. The protagonist is invited to show the posture, the way of speaking, the behavior, the emotion, the attitude, and any other information of his significant other. This technique helps the protagonist explore any information of the role. Several books have described how to conduct role reversal.\n\nPsychodramatist and author Lewis Yablonsky proposes four reasons for the function of role reversal. He takes a mother-daughter relationship as an example. First of all, role reversal helps the protagonist to feel and understand the other role and how it reacts with its environment. For example, the daughter gets more awareness about how her mother feels about and reacts to the role of the daughter.\n\nThe second reason is that role reversal helps the protagonist observe himself as if in a mirror. Through playing her mother's role, the daughter sees the role of daughter from her mother's perspective. Yablonsky provides the daughter description, for example: \"From the vantage point of my mother, I saw for the first time that she feels badly about her age and her looks and is putting me down because she has begun to compete with me.\"\n\nThe next reason is that role reversal prevents the protagonist from being trapped in his own defenses. Yablonsky provides another example about the fight within spouses. Through role reversal, the spouses change their positions with the other and then produce new insight of the whole interaction. This technique helps the protagonist to gain more understanding of a significant other rather than being stuck in his own perspective.\n\nThe last reason is that role reversal helps an auxiliary ego understand how a specific role that he is going to play will be perceived by the protagonist. For example, when the daughter plays the role of her mother, she provides some information and cues for the auxiliary ego to know how the role of mother should be played. This technique enables the protagonist and auxiliary to demonstrate the problematic situation that is perceived by the protagonist.\n\nBesides the above reasons, role reversal is useful for a protagonist to gain control over a hierarchy situation with which the protagonist disagrees. Paul Holmes mentions that this technique also enables other group members to learn the protagonist's view of important people. Role reversal helps the protagonist see his interpersonal relationships more objectively and transcend the habitual limitations of egocentricity. In sum, role reversal helps the protagonist, the auxiliary, the director, and the audience to get more understanding of the dynamic interactions of the protagonist's life.\n\n\n"}

It is southeastern part of Bačka, located in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Territory of Šajkaška is divided among four municipalities: Titel, Žabalj, Novi Sad, and Srbobran. Historical center of Šajkaška is Titel.\n\nName \"Šajkaška\" means \"land of šajkaši\". Šajkaši were a specific kind of Austrian army, which moved in narrow, long boats, known as \"šajka\". These military units have operated on the Danube, Tisa, Sava and Moriš rivers. In Hungarian, the region is known as \"Sajkásvidék\" and in German as \"Schajkaschka\".\n\nAfter 1400, the majority of the people in Šajkaška were Serbs who had settled the area before or after the Ottoman conquered the Balkan lands to the south . Moving further north, they had become established at csepel Island where they founded Srpski Kovin (Raczkeve). After 1526 and the Battle of Mohacs, they moved to the northern Danube and to the city of Komarno which, for a long time, was the administrative headquarters of the Šajkaš forces. \n\nAfter the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the region was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Most of Šajkaška was included into Habsburg Military Frontier (its Danube and Tisa sections), while one part of the region was included into Bodrog County. When these parts of Military Frontier were abolished (in 1750), Šajkaška was included into Theiss District, which was part of the Batsch-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1763, Šajkaška was excluded from Theiss District and was again placed under military administration. Šajkaš Battalion, as part of Military Frontier, was founded in this area. In the beginning of the Habsburg administration, the population of the region was composed entirely of Serbs, which were brave and skillful warriors. Serb Šajkaši have participated in many battles against Ottoman Empire.\nBy 1739 and the Peace of Belgrade, the border between Austria and Turkey was moved to the Sava and Danube rivers, and at that time, the idea was proposed to move the Šajkaši down from the north. That was done in 1763-1764. \nIn 1848-1849, region was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, but was again included into Military Frontier in 1849. In 1852, Šajkaš battalion was transformed into Titel infantry battalion. This military unit was abolished in 1873, and region was again incorporated into Bács-Bodrog County. Administratively, territory of Šajkaška was organized into municipality of Titel and separate municipality of Žabalj was also later established. In 1910, ethnic Serbs formed an absolute majority in both municipalities. Besides Serbs who formed majority in most settlements, region was also populated by Hungarians who formed majority in the village Budisava and sizable minority in few other settlements, Germans who formed sizable minority in several settlements and Rusyns who formed sizable minority in Đurđevo.\n\nIn 1918, as part of Banat, Bačka and Baranja region, Šajkaška became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922 Šajkaška was part of the Novi Sad County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Belgrade Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, region was occupied by the Axis Powers and was attached to Bács-Bodrog County of the Horthy's Hungary. In 1942 raid, Hungarian occupational authorities killed numerous ethnic Serbs, Jews and Romani in Šajkaška. In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis forces from the region and Šajkaška became part of the autonomous province of Vojvodina within new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1945, AP Vojvodina is part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. Today, Šajkaška is mainly agricultural region, with well-developed food industry.\n\nIn 2002, population of Šajkaška numbered 67,355 people, including:\n\nTitel municipality:\n\nŽabalj municipality:\n\nNovi Sad municipality:\n\nSrbobran municipality:\n\nNote: Titel and Žabalj are towns and administrative centres of municipalities. Other places are villages.\n\nThere is a Serb Orthodox Kovilj monastery in the area. It is situated near the village of Kovilj. The monastery was reconstructed in 1705-1707. According to the legend, the monastery was founded by the first Serb archbishop Saint Sava in the 13th century.\n\n\n\n"}

In a certain sense, the skeleton of a category is the \"smallest\" equivalent category, which captures all \"categorical properties\" of the original. In fact, two categories are equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic skeletons. A category is called skeletal if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.\n\nA skeleton of a category \"C\" is an equivalent category \"D\" in which no two distinct objects are isomorphic. It is generally considered to be a subcategory. In detail, a skeleton of \"C\" is a category \"D\" such that:\n\nfor every pair of objects \"d\" and \"d\" of \"D\", the morphisms in \"D\" are morphisms in \"C\", i.e.\nand the identities and compositions in \"D\" are the restrictions of those in \"C\".\n\nIt is a basic fact that every small category has a skeleton; more generally, every accessible category has a skeleton. (This is equivalent to the axiom of choice.) Also, although a category may have many distinct skeletons, any two skeletons are isomorphic as categories, so up to isomorphism of categories, the skeleton of a category is unique.\n\nThe importance of skeletons comes from the fact that they are (up to isomorphism of categories), canonical representatives of the equivalence classes of categories under the equivalence relation of equivalence of categories. This follows from the fact that any skeleton of a category \"C\" is equivalent to \"C\", and that two categories are equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic skeletons.\n\n\n\n"}

The band garnered attention for blending melody and groove into a traditional hardcore framework, but its attempts to pursue an alternative metal direction on its third album were met with limited commercial success. The band reunited in 2008 and have since released two further albums, \"The Cursed Remain Cursed\" in 2012 and \"Razed to the Ground\" in 2015.\n\nGuitarists Matt Baumbach and Mike Kennedy formed the band in 1992 with vocalist/lyricist Tim Williams, drummer Brendon Cohen, and bassist Mike Fleischmann. Vision of Disorder released a series of demos and contributed to several compilations before releasing the \"Still EP\" in 1995 on Striving for Togetherness Records. The band appeared in the N.Y.H.C. documentary around the same time. Vision of Disorder gained attention for incorporating different styles into its hardcore framework.\n\nThe band signed with Roadrunner Records' subsidiary, Supersoul, and released its eponymous full-length debut in 1996. The band was later praised for its impact upon the popularization of hardcore music: the debut album was \"metallic hardcore that no one had heard, released for a mass audience on a big label. It had its merits; powerful, screamed vocals often layered over depressing clean vocals combined with fresh 'un-hardcore' guitar sections and unfamiliar drum patterns. For anyone into hardcore at the time, this was the album to have.\"\n\nVision of Disorder's second album, \"Imprint\", was released in 1998 on Roadrunner Records and featured guest vocals by Pantera's Phil Anselmo on the song \"By The River\". The band was displeased with the raw production quality, which it attributed to the brief window for recording the album. Vision of Disorder also took issue with the purported lack of tour support by its record label. The band and label severed their working relationship acrimoniously, as Williams recalls:\n\nAfter the label strife, Vision of Disorder kept a relatively low profile. However, they eventually returned in 1999 with \"For the Bleeders\", a set of nine re-recorded demo songs released on Go-Kart Records.\n\nIn 2001, Vision of Disorder released \"From Bliss to Devastation\" on TVT Records. The album marked a shift towards a traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting structure. Kennedy described the album as \"fitting in with the nu-metal scene\" while Williams praised the band's songwriting approach:\n\nReportedly frustrated by the lack of support from TVT, Vision of Disorder went on extended hiatus and eventually disbanded. Williams and Kennedy formed the band Bloodsimple while Cohen and Fleischmann played in Karvnov.\n\nVision of Disorder reunited briefly in order to play three songs during a show with Bloodsimple and Karnov. The band played several one-off shows and shot footage for a DVD before formally reuniting in October 2008. Williams described the material for the reunion album as similar to \"Imprint\". While the album was ultimately delayed several times, in July 2011, the first single, \"The Enemy\", was released on Candlelight Records. On September 18, 2012, \"The Cursed Remain Cursed\" was released. The album was celebrated as \"largely a return to the confrontational metallic hardcore that gave \"Imprint\" its cult following,\" although \"some elements of \"From Bliss to Devastation\"...creep in on occasion\". \n\nAround this time Matt Baumbach left the band, and former Mind Over Matter/dayinthelife guitarist Josh Demarco took his place in the line-up. VOD's next album was released on November 27, 2015, 'Razed To The Ground', via Candlelight Records (and was produced by Zeuss).

The later position was a source of controversy when it was revealed that Wilson made an agreement with Bush that gave the president control over his records that was ultimately judged \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to law.\"\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan swore-in Wilson on December 4, 1987, with US Congressman Dick Cheney, serving as the master of ceremonies.\n\nOn May 18, 1992, in his official capacity as Archivist, he officially certified the ratification of the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and on May 19, 1992, printed it in the Federal Register, together with the certificate of ratification. Due to the length of time between the amendment's submission and ratification (more than 202 years), doing this without congressional approval was controversial, with Speaker of the House Tom Foley and others called for a legal challenge to the amendment's unusual ratification.\n\nHowever, Wilson had acted under statutory authority granted to his office by the Congress under Title 1, section 106b of the United States Code, which states:\n\nOn May 20, 1992, each house of the 102nd Congress passed a version of a concurrent resolution agreeing that the amendment was validly ratified, despite the unorthodox period of more than 202 years for ratification. However, neither resolution was adopted by the entire Congress.\n\nDuring his time at the National Archives and Records Administration, Wilson was a vocal advocate for the preservation of electronic records. In spite of his \"advocacy\" for the preservation of electronic records, late on the night of January 19, 1993 (the day before the end of George H. W. Bush's presidency), Wilson signed a controversial deal, giving President Bush exclusive legal control over 5,000 tapes from White House computers. Three weeks later, Wilson announced that he would become executive director of the Bush Presidential Library Center. Wilson was investigated for conflict of interest; the midnight deal was later declared null and void by a federal judge.\n\nIn late 1992 there was also a controversy regarding his prior choice of Lawrence Oberg as NARA Inspector General.\n\nWilson was a National Defense Fellow from 1964 to 1967 while at the University of Cincinnati, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cincinnati in 1988.\n\nDon W.

He was the first male descendant of Malcolm X. In 1997, when he was 12 years old, Shabazz set fire to the apartment of his grandmother, Betty Shabazz, causing her death. Shabazz was murdered in Mexico City on May 9, 2013, at the age of 28. He was said to be on a tour to demand more rights for Mexican construction workers relocated to the USA.\n\nMalcolm Shabazz was born in Paris on October 8, 1984. His father, L. A. Bouasba, was an Algerian Muslim whom Qubilah Shabazz met there. According to Malcolm, he never met his father. Other sources say Malcolm knew his father, but they had little contact with one another.\n\nWhen Malcolm was a few months old, he and his mother moved to Los Angeles. A little while later, they moved to New York City and then Philadelphia. One landlord there remembered frequently having to let young Malcolm into the apartment because his mother was not at home. Malcolm showed some evidence of disturbance as a child. As a three-year-old, he reportedly set fire to his shoes. He brought a knife to school in the third grade. About the same time, he suffered from delusions and was hospitalized for a short time.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Malcolm often stayed with his grandmother Betty and his aunts in New York, while his mother Qubilah lived with various friends. In 1994, Malcolm moved with his mother to Minneapolis. She was being drawn into a plot to assassinate Louis Farrakhan by an FBI informant, Michael Fitzpatrick. Malcolm saw in Fitzpatrick the father figure he had never known, calling him \"my dad\". In January 1995, Qubilah was charged with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan. She accepted a plea agreement with respect to the charges, in which she maintained her innocence but accepted responsibility for her actions. Under the terms of the agreement, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a two-year period in order to avoid a prison sentence. For the duration of her treatment, ten-year-old Malcolm was sent to live with Betty at her apartment in Yonkers, New York.\n\nMalcolm visited Qubilah in December 1996 in San Antonio, where she was undergoing treatment. She had remarried, and Malcolm quickly bonded with his stepfather. The marriage soon ended; Malcolm and his mother began to fight, sometimes physically. On February 26, 1997, she called the police saying she wanted him committed to a mental hospital. After a brief stay, Malcolm was released. In April, he called the police and reported that they had been in a fight. His mother said she was going to place him in foster care, but sent Malcolm back to New York on April 26 to live with his grandmother instead.\n\nOn June 1, 1997, Malcolm Shabazz, then twelve years of age, started a fire in Betty Shabazz's apartment. She suffered burns over 80 percent of her body. The police found Malcolm wandering the streets, barefoot and reeking of gasoline. Betty Shabazz died of her injuries on June 23, 1997. At a hearing, experts described Malcolm as psychotic and schizophrenic. He was also described as \"brilliant but disturbed.\" He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention for manslaughter and arson, with possible annual extensions until his 18th birthday. Shabazz was released after four years.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with \"The New York Times\", Shabazz, then aged 18, gave his version of the fire and the events leading up to it. He explained that he had been unhappy living in New York with his grandmother and had stated: \"being bad, doing anything to get them to send me back to my mother. Then I got the idea to set the fire.\" Expressing remorse for the event, Shabazz continued:\nI set a fire in the hallway, and I didn't think the whole thing through thoroughly, but she didn't have to run through that fire ... There was another way out of the house from her room. I guess what she thought was I was stuck, and she had to run and get me because it was in front of my room as well. She ran through the fire. I did not picture that happening, that she would do that.\n\nExpressing regret for his actions, Malcolm said he would sit on his jail cot and ask for a sign of forgiveness from his dead grandmother. Shabazz said:\nI just wanted her to know I was sorry and I wanted to know she accepted my apology, that I didn't mean it. But I would get no response, and I really wanted that response.\n\nIn the same interview, Shabazz also dismissed the child psychiatrist's diagnosis of him at his trial that he was a paranoid schizophrenic, saying that he had only \"made up\" a story about hearing voices in his childhood \"to get attention\".\n\nFollowing his release, Shabazz lived for a time with his aunt, Ilyasah Shabazz. He was arrested in 2002 for stealing $100. He pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Shabazz was arrested again in 2006, for punching a hole in a store's glass window.\n\nIn 2010, Shabazz made the \"Hajj\" to Mecca.\n\nIn February 2013, Iranian state-controlled Press TV reported that Shabazz had been arrested by the FBI while en route to Iran. The story was widely reported, but, two days later, Shabazz's family announced that the Press TV report was incorrect. They said Shabazz had been arrested, but his arrest had nothing to do with the FBI or Iran.\n\nShabazz died in Mexico City on May 9, 2013, at the age of 28. He was said to be on a tour to demand more rights for Mexican construction workers relocated to the USA. His body, which according to prosecutors had been badly beaten with a rod of some kind, was found in the street in Plaza Garibaldi, a busy tourist spot. According to \"New York\" magazine, a friend who was with Shabazz the night of his death said the beating was related to a dispute over a $1,200 bar tab for drinks and female companionship. On May 13, David Hernandez Cruz and Manuel Alejandro Pérez de Jesús, waiters at a nightclub called \"The Palace\", were arrested in connection with Shabazz's death. In 2015, Pérez de Jesús and Juan Dircio Guzmán, the headwaiter at The Palace, were each sentenced to terms of 27 years and six months for their roles in the murder. As of June 2015, Hernandez was awaiting trial and a fourth suspect was still being pursued by police.\n\nApproximately 200 people attended his funeral in California. One activist stated that Shabazz had plans to construct mosques and schools throughout America.\n\nShabazz was survived by his mother, his two daughters, and five aunts. He was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, near the graves of his grandparents, Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz.\n\n"}

He consequently quit his job and began a new career as an environmental activist and spokesman. \n\nHe claims to have lived on $5,000 a year (close to the global median income) for 16 years (ca. 1989 – 2005), later increasing to $10,000 per year. He founded the Alternative Transportation Task Force in San Luis Obispo, California and served briefly as an elected officer of the Sierra Club; he conducts approximately 60 workshops each year on sustainable living and \"radical simplicity\" in the United States, Canada, and Spain.\n\nIn 1994 he received an Earthwatch Gaia Fellowship, allowing him to visit Kerala, India, and parts of the Himalayas to research sustainable living. In 1995, he founded the Global Living Project and continues to serve as its co-director. \n\nIn April 2005, Dartmouth College appointed him its first Sustainability Director. He lives in Belfast, Maine with his partner, Susan, and his Son, Walden.\nHe is now working on Saving Walden's World, A film About how having small families and small ecological footprints can save the planet.\n\n\n\n"}

Armstrong (\"née\" Hamilton, born July 19, 1975) is an American blogger who resides in Salt Lake City, Utah. She writes under the pseudonym of Dooce, a pseudonym that came from her inability to quickly spell \"dude\" during online chats with her former co-workers.\n\nArmstrong was raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Memphis, Tennessee, and majored in English at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, graduating in 1997. She then left the church and moved to Los Angeles to work. Armstrong married web designer Jon Armstrong and returned to Salt Lake City to work as a consultant and designer herself. Her blog, started in 2001, cost her her job the following year after her coworkers discovered she had been writing about them; after her termination she continued it, focusing on her parenting struggles and eventually running ads in 2004. Five years later she had 8.5 million viewers a month and was reportedly making over $100,000 annually from banner ads on Dooce. Armstrong appeared on \"Oprah\" and was featured by \"Forbes\" magazine among 30 honorees on its list of \"The Most Influential Women In Media\" for 2009.\n\nIn 2012 the Armstrongs announced they were separating. The Armstrongs announced they were divorcing in 2012. They have two daughters together: Leta Elise (born 2004), and Marlo Iris (born 2009). Since the divorce she and former Senate candidate Pete Ashdown have become romantically involved and live together.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, readership of Dooce began to decline due to the influence of social media. In the wake of her divorce, and vicious criticism of her and her blog online, Armstrong retreated from regularly blogging and confronted her depression. After an experimental treatment in 2017 proved successful, she resumed her previous Internet posting, albeit to a much smaller audience, and began making money as an influencer, although she is critical of the practice. \n\nArmstrong was born Heather Hamilton in 1975 and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. Raised in the LDS Church, she began having doubts about it and experiencing bouts of depression while a student at Brigham Young University (BYU) in predominantly Mormon Utah. After graduating in 1997, she left both the church and state, relocating to Los Angeles where she found work as a web developer for startups during the dot-com boom.\n\nIn 2002, Armstrong ignited a fierce debate about privacy issues when she was allegedly fired from her job as a web designer and graphic artist because she had written satirical accounts of her experiences at a dot-com startup on her personal blog, \"dooce.com\". She did not challenge her termination and has refrained from identifying her place of employment in interviews.\n\nArmstrong warned her fellow bloggers:\n\n\"Dooced\" can mean \"getting fired for something you've written on your website\", a sense humorously disavowed by Armstrong in her blog's FAQ. This definition was used by the television game show \"Jeopardy!\" on December 10, 2009, as evidenced by a screenshot on her blog the following day.\n\nArmstrong kept blogging in the wake of her termination, and through a mutual friend met Jon Armstrong, another former Mormon web developer from Utah. They married and returned to their home state to start a family. In 2004, after the couple's first daughter was born, Armstrong began devoting much of her blog to parenting, becoming one of the first mommybloggers.\n\nArmstrong has written extensively and humorously of her struggle with depression, entering a mental health hospital, as well as her pregnancies, parenthood, and her experiences with the LDS Church. The latter has caused some controversy, as Armstrong is no longer a member. She has called BYU one of the worst places that exist and that she left the Church the day after she graduated since her diploma was withheld over a $20 unpaid parking ticket that she had incurred after being unable to find a legal parking spot for a mandatory church service.\n\nArmstrong says the following about her site, dooce.com, which began in February 2001 with a post about Carnation Milk: \"Since then I have published more than 5,300 entries covering topics such as breast milk pumps, golf cart rides with Norah Jones, and the one guy I dated who talked like Elmo during sex.\"\n\nIn 2004, Armstrong accepted text advertisements on her website for the first time, a decision that was controversial among her readership. The following year, Armstrong accepted graphic ads and wrote that the revenue from the advertisements would be her family's principal source of income while her husband made the transition to manage her advertising and business. Since then, she has appeared in Suave advertisements that feature her own image and trademark. In 2009, Armstrong again received mass media attention for using Twitter to get her washing machine fixed.\n\nBy that year, ads visible to Dooce's 8.5 million monthly readers made a reported $40,000 for the Armstrongs each month, making it her primary source of income; she began running sponsored content as well. She appeared on \"Oprah\" and, along with Oprah herself, was included in \"Forbes\" list of the 30 Most Influential Women in Media. In November of that year, Armstrong introduced a new, interactive section to her website that allows registered users to post questions and responses. Armstrong introduced this new section, the Dooce Community, by posting an entry (11/2/09) on the main dooce.com page:\n\nDooce.com has received multiple nominations and awards from The Weblog Awards, including a lifetime achievement award for Armstrong in 2008.\n\nDooce also attracted attention from websites devoted to making sardonic and critical observations about lifestyle bloggers, such as Get Off My Internets and the subreddit blogsnark. The mostly female readers of those forums second-guessed Armstrong's parenting decisions and suggested she did not appreciate how privileged she was. Heather responded by posting hate mail she received from the readers of those sites on a separate page, which she has since taken down, called \"Monetizing the Hate\"; Jon joked in 2011 that the traffic from the hate sites had been better for the family business than the birth of their second daughter two years earlier. By then the revenue from Dooce paid salaries not only to the Armstrongs but an assistant and two full-time babysitters.\n\nThe Armstrongs announced they were separating in 2012; Heather posted to Dooce explaining why while Jon posted on his blog, Blurbomat. At the time the announcement came as a surprise since Heather had never written about any marital difficulties, and had often written positively of her husband's support for her during her struggles with the children and her depression. Later, she said the couple had at that point been in counseling for years; Jon was \"controlling and punishing\" and expected her to just get over the negative commentary on her site.\n\nThe divorce was finalized the following year. Jon moved to New York City with a new girlfriend; the Armstrong daughters spend the summer with him. By that time the audience for blogs that had been so large in the 2000s was starting to dissipate; many readers moved on to social media and other once-popular blogs shut down.\n\nIn 2015, Armstrong announced that she would be taking a step back from blogging in order to focus on speaking and consulting work. While she was able at first to travel and make speaking engagements, and do some freelance marketing work, she soon found the pressures of single parenthood overwhelmed her. Depression returned and by 2017, Armstrong says she felt like \"a heap of nothingness\" and could not go on living.\n\nThat year she enrolled in a clinical trial at the University of Utah's Neuropsychiatric Institute. Over 10 sessions, she was put into an induced coma for 15 minutes, an action meant to simulate brain death. After the treatment, she felt well enough to resume blogging as regularly as she had before 2015, and also published \"The Valedictorian of Being Dead\", a book about her experience.\n\nArmstrong returned to a different Internet. Most lifestyle bloggers like her had been replaced by, or evolved into, influencers. \"Mommy blogging is dead, and I think most of my colleagues would agree\", she told \"Vox\" in 2019.\n\nArmstrong still does sponsored content, gets affiliate marketing revenue from Stitch Fix and Amazon, and now maintains an Instagram feed in addition to her blog. Dooce still gets a half million readers per month, most of them from her following a decade earlier. She does not post any pictures or anecdotes about her daughters without their approval. In addition to her standard material about her parenting and family issues, Armstrong also posts about mental health issues such as those she herself has faced. \"I want people with depression to feel like they are seen,” she says, “especially here in Utah, where teen suicide is an epidemic.\" Eventually, she told \"Vox\", she wants to start a nonprofit devoted to the subject.\n\nPete Ashdown, a tech entrepreneur and two-time Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seats from Utah, has become Armstrong's boyfriend and now lives with her and her daughters. He, too, is a former Mormon.\n\nIn late 2005, Armstrong entered into negotiations with Kensington Books to produce two books, one of which was to be a memoir of early parenthood. The negotiations broke down in May 2006, and Kensington sued to force Armstrong to fulfill the terms of the unsigned contract. In October 2006 both parties agreed to a settlement which allowed Armstrong to seek another publisher.\n\nKensington Books released a book of essays, \"Things I Learned About My Dad: In Therapy\", on April 29, 2008, edited by Heather B. Armstrong.\n\nHer second book, \"It Sucked and Then I Cried: How I Had a Baby, a Breakdown, and a Much Needed Margarita\" was released on March 24, 2009 and published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment. It reached #16 on \"The New York Times\" Bestseller List for April 12, 2009.\n\nArmstrong was a music columnist and consultant for the Alpha Mom media network. She and her ex-husband ran Armstrong Media, LLC, a web design, advertising and content-generation business. As of 2015, Jon Armstrong runs it without her. She also was a panelist for the online video series \"Momversation\".\n\nIn late 2009, Armstrong announced a partnership with the television network HGTV in which she would \"work with HGTV’s online and on-air production teams to create innovative convergence programming for the network.\" While the bulk of her partnership activities began in the spring of 2010, Armstrong began contributing weekly content to the network's Design Happens blog in February 2010. Her last post on Design Happens was in September 2010.\n\n"}

His election to the Hall of Fame has been controversial, as he never before his final two seasons was regarded as even the best defenceman on his own team—his contemporaries for most of his career were the Hall of Famers King Clancy and Hap Day, who were—and seems to rest more on his unprecedented and unequaled seven seasons as the NHL penalty minute leader.

It is subdivided into 100 \"senti\" (Somali, also ), \"cents\" (English) or (Italian).\n\nThe shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling was introduced to the former British Somaliland protectorate. Following independence in 1960, the somalo of Italian Somaliland and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling. Names used for the denominations were cent (singular: centesimo; plural: centesimi) and سنت (plural: سنتيمات) together with shilling (singular: scellino; plural: scellini) and شلن.\n\nOn 15 October 1962, the Banca Nazionale Somala (National Bank of Somalia) issued notes denominated as 5, 10, 20 and 100 scellini/shillings. In 1975, the \"Bankiga Qaranka Soomaaliyeed\" (Somali National Bank) introduced notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 shilin/shillings. These were followed in 1978 by notes of the same denominations issued by the \"Bankiga Dhexe Ee Soomaaliya\" (Central Bank of Somalia). 50 shilin/shillings notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 500 shilin/shillings in 1989 and 1000 shilin/shillings in 1990. Also in 1990 there was an attempt to reform the currency at 100 to 1, with new banknotes of 20 and 50 new shilin prepared for the redenomination.\n\nIn terms of coins, the East African shilling and somalo initially circulated. In 1967, coins were issued in the name of the Somali Republic in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 cents/centesimi and 1 shilling/scellino. In 1976, when the Somali names for the denominations were introduced, coins were issued in the name of the Somali Democratic Republic for 5, 10 and 50 senti and 1 shilling.\n\nFollowing the breakdown in central authority that accompanied the civil war, which began in the early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the Somaliland territory, subsequently emerged. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. Competition for seigniorage drove the value of the money down to about $0.04 per ShSo (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers also refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which helped to stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries were treated as the same currency. It took large bundles to make cash purchases, and the United States dollar was often used for larger transactions.\n\nThe Somaliland shilling is the official currency of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is not internationally recognized and acts as an autonomous region of Somalia. The currency is not recognized as legal tender by the international community, and it currently has no official exchange rate. It is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the regions central bank and Somaliland people.\n\nIn the late 2000s, Somalia's newly established Transitional Federal Government revived the defunct Central Bank of Somalia. In terms of financial management, the monetary authority is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy. Owing to a lack of confidence in the Somali shilling, the U.S. dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low-value transactions. The new central bank of Somalia expects this inflationary environment to come to an end as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.\n\nWith a significant improvement in local security, Somali expatriates began returning to the country for investment opportunities. Coupled with modest foreign investment, the inflow of funds have helped the Somali shilling increase considerably in value. By March 2014, the currency had appreciated by almost 60% against the U.S. dollar over the previous 12 months. The Somali shilling was the strongest among the 175 global currencies traded by Bloomberg, rising close to 50 percentage points higher than the next most robust global currency over the same period.\n\nFree market rates in Somalia:\n\n\n\n"}

Overshoot is caused by the momentum of the convecting material, which carries the material beyond the unstable region.\n\nOne example is thermal columns extending above the top of the equilibrium level (EL) in thunderstorms: unstable air rising from (or near) the surface normally stops rising at the EL (near the tropopause) and spreads out as an anvil cloud; but in the event of a strong updraft, unstable air is carried past the EL as an \"overshooting top\" or \"dome\". A parcel of air will stop ascending at the maximum parcel level (MPL). This overshoot is responsible for most of the turbulence experienced in the cruise phase of commercial air flights.\n\nAnother example of convective overshoot is at the base of the convection zone in the solar interior. The heat of the Sun's thermonuclear fusion is carried outward by radiation in the deep interior radiation zone and by convective circulation in the outer convection zone, but cool sinking material from the surface penetrates farther into the radiative zone than theory would suggest. This affects the heat transfer rate and the temperature of the solar interior which can be indirectly measured by helioseismology. The layer between the Sun's convective and radiative zone is called the tachocline.\n\nOvershooting in the convective core of more massive stars is critical to the modelling of evolution beyond the main sequence. Overshooting causes the core mass at the end of the main sequence to be larger than would otherwise be expected. This leads to big differences in behaviour on the subgiant and giant branches for intermediate mass stars, and to radical changes in the evolution of massive supergiant stars.\n"}

Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University and founder of the Department of War Studies, King's College London. In 1958, he co-founded the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nHoward was described in the \"Financial Times\" as \"Britain's greatest living historian\". \"The Guardian\" described him as \"Britain's foremost expert on conflict\".\n\nHoward was born on 29 November 1922 in the village of Ashmore in Dorset. He was the youngest son of Geoffrey Howard and Edith (). He was educated at Wellington College and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1946, which was later promoted to Master of Arts (MA) in 1948.\n\nHoward joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coldstream Guards on 4 December 1942. He was given the service number 253901. He fought in the Italian Campaign, serving with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and came ashore during the landings at Salerno in September 1943. On 27 January 1944, during the First Battle of Monte Cassino, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) \"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Italy\".\n\nAfter Oxford, Howard began his teaching career at King's College London, where he created the Department of War Studies. From his position at King's he was one of Britain's most influential figures in developing strategic studies as a discipline that brought together government, military, and academia to think about defence and national security more broadly and deeply than had been done before.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. From his family, education, and service in the Guards, he had extensive connections at the higher levels of British society, and he worked them astutely to further his intellectual goals. He had close connections in the Labour Party but was also consulted as an advisor by Margaret Thatcher.\n\nHoward was best known for expanding military history beyond the traditional campaigns and battles accounts to include wider discussions about the sociological significance of war. In his account of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Howard looked at how the Prussian and French armies reflected the social structure of the two nations. He was also a leading interpreter of the writings of the Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz, including preparing the leading translation of \"On War\" with the American historian Peter Paret.\n\nIn addition, in both his inaugural and concluding lectures as Regius Professor, and in his popular and influential \"War in European History\", Howard stressed the difference between traditional military history, which seeks to identify easily applicable lessons for the present from the history of past wars and military campaigns, and his own approach, which stresses the uniqueness of the historical past and the impossibility of deriving such lessons to guide modern strategic and tactical choices.\n\nIn 1985, he delivered the Huizinga Lecture in the Dutch city of Leiden, under the title: \"1945: End of an Era\". Howard helped found the Department of War Studies and the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's College London. He was president emeritus of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which he also helped to establish, and a fellow of the British Academy.\n\nHoward was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1977 Birthday Honours and a Knight Bachelor in the 1986 Birthday Honours. He was later appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for services to military studies in the 2002 Birthday Honours and to the Order of Merit (OM) in 2005. In 1988 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences. In 1992, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement given by the Society for Military History.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The story is inspired by a tragedy that happened in the Alummoottil Tharavad, a central Travancore family, in the 19th century. The film dealt with an unusual theme which was not common in Indian cinema at the time. The film became the highest-grossing Malayalam film ever at the box-office and received widespread critical acclaim.\n\nDirectors Siddique-Lal, Priyadarshan, and Sibi Malayil served as second-unit directors. The cinematography was by Venu and it was edited by T. R. Shekar. The film has an ensemble cast featuring Mohanlal, Suresh Gopi, Shobana, Nedumudi Venu, Innocent, Vinaya Prasad, K. P. A. C. Lalitha, K. B. Ganesh Kumar, Sudheesh, and Thilakan in the main roles. The original songs featured in the movie were composed by M. G. Radhakrishnan, while the original score was composed by Johnson. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and Shobhana was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Ganga / Nagavalli.\n\nApart from being the highest-grossing Malayalam film ever, \"Manichitrathazhu\" is considered as one of the best Malayalam films ever made. It ran for 365 days in theatres. \"Manichitrathazhu\" was remade after 10 years in four languages – in Kannada as \"Apthamitra\", in Tamil as \"Chandramukhi\", in Bengali as \"Rajmohol\" and in Hindi as \"Bhool Bhulaiyaa\" – all being commercially successful. \"Geethaanjali\", a spin-off directed by Priyadarshan and Mohanlal reprising the role of Dr. Sunny Joseph, was made in 2013.\n\nA young couple, Ganga and Nakulan, arrives at Nakulan's ancestral home \"tharavadu\" called Madampalli. Hailing from a family that follows tradition and superstitions, Nakulan's uncles Thampi and Unnithan object to the couple's idea of moving into the allegedly haunted mansion, which Nakulan ignores. The couple moves in, following which seemingly supernatural events are triggered.\n\nThe mansion was occupied decades ago by Sankaran Thampi Karanavar, a feudal lord of the province who was also the then-head of the family. In his heyday, he had brought in a dancer girl, Nagavalli, from Tamil Nadu as his concubine. But she was already in love with a man named Ramanathan, a dancer who came along with her secretly and settled in the cottage next to the mansion. Learning of their affair and their plan to elope, Sankaran Thampi turns angry and murders Nagavalli in her room at the mansion. Legend has it that on the eighth day of Navaratri, on Durgashtami (an annual Hindu celebration) night, Nagavalli returned as a bloodthirsty spirit for the purpose of murdering the Karanavar, but he escaped upon chanting some mantras. With the assistance of sorcerers from Aalappara, Karanavar escaped from the wrath of Nagavalli. Her spirit was locked in the Southmost portion of the mansion (Thekkini) by placing a talisman over the lock. Later the Karanavar committed suicide and his spirit was locked up beside the same room, by means of an ornate enchanted lock called \"manichitrathazhu\".\n\nIn the present-day, a curious Ganga manages to unlock the Thekkini, only to find paintings of the Karanavar and Nagavalli, and ancient valuables such as jewellery and musical instruments. Upon learning about the unlocking of the Thekkini, fearing the spirits are on the loose, Nakulan's uncle Thampi and family move into the mansion to try and re-seal the Thekkini lock, while also looking out for Nakulan and Ganga. However, various unclear sightings of a woman are witnessed around the mansion, along with attempted attacks on various people at the mansion, including Ganga and later Unnithan's daughter Alli. While most of the family including Thampi believe that Nagavalli's ghost roams the mansion, Nakulan, disapproving of any supernatural theory, suspects Sreedevi (Thampi's daughter) who was present during all events of attack, to be mentally ill, hence orchestrating the incidents at the mansion. Hearing of this, Thampi and the family fear that Sreedevi might be possessed by Nagavalli's spirit.\n\nSreedevi who is Nakulan's cousin, according to tradition, was to be married to Nakulan; however, after finding that Sreedevi had an ominous horoscope, Nakulan's mother withdrew from this proposal, and got Nakulan married to Ganga; later, Sreedevi entered a marriage which was short-lived. Sreedevi's tragic past, along with her perceived gloominess, and her being the only person present during an attack on Ganga, lays cause for suspicion of her.\n\nDr. Sunny Joseph, a brilliant yet frolicsome Psychiatrist and Nakulan's close friend is called from the United States to investigate. Soon enough Dr. Sunny finds out that Nakulan's conclusions are not as obvious and he predicts a murder to happen during the upcoming Durga Ashtami Festival.\n\nFew days later, during a Kathakali programme, the entire family is present as audience while Sunny and Nakulan enter later. As both of them goes in search of Ganga, they spot Mahadevan, a renowned novelist and the family's next-door neighbor who is also Alli's fiance, having a tussle with Ganga. Thinking that Ganga was being abused by him, Nakulan attempts to hit Mahadevan but gets stopped by Sunny. The three of them take care of an unconscious Ganga and after she goes to sleep, Sunny reveals certain shocking truths to the other two.\n\nRight from the night of his arrival, Sunny's trained psychiatric mind begins to suspect that Ganga could well be the mental patient of Madampalli. He investigates Ganga's childhood and past with the help of Chandu, who is Thampi's son and Sreedevi's younger brother. Ganga grew up in a highly superstitious family and had partaken in various religious rituals as a child. Her parents had left her to her grandmother at the age of 3 and never bothered about her due to their busy lifestyle. This made her sensitive as an individual; so when she came to know that her parents were moving her to Calcutta she was unable to come to grips with it. She had become very close to her grandmother and didn't want to leave her village and her ancestral home. It was a period of great emotional and psychological turmoil for her, and she slowly developed multiple personality disorder. Years later, Madampalli with its share of superstitions and dark tales evokes memories of childhood days in her, and Ganga slowly develops the personality of Nagavalli after having empathised with her and her devastating backstory.\n\nMeanwhile, Thampi having lost faith in Dr. Sunny, calls in a renowned tantric expert Pullattuparam Brahmadathan Namboothiripad to get rid of his family's supernatural menace. As fate has it, both the Namboothiripad and Sunny are old acquaintances and mutually admire each other's expertise in their respective fields. At his own risk, Sunny reveals the secret to Namboothiripad and also adds some of the facts which he observed from Ganga's alter ego behaviour.\n\nWhen Ganga transforms into Nagavalli, her alter ego assumes the man staying in dancer Ramanathan's ancient house (Mahadevan) as Ramanathan. Similarly she assumes Nakulan to be the cruel Karnavar Sankaran Thampi, thereby waiting to kill him on Durga Ashtami night to take her revenge. Sunny specifies on these kind of associating mystical codes picked up by Ganga's alter-ego from the tales of the house.\n\nGanga gets a loose idea of her illness during a manifestation of her hidden personality by Nakulan on the directions of Sunny. Sunny, with help of the Namboothiripad, plans an elaborate Tantric ceremony to create a suitable atmosphere and invoke Ganga's Nagavalli persona and make it believe that it will finally be able to kill it's enemy Sankaran Thampi. The plan is put into action and in a fiery climax, Namboothiripad orders the blood thirsty Nagavalli in Ganga to exact revenge on Karanavar by making Nakulan lie down on a platform, and giving a sword to Nagavalli. As Nagavalli is about to pick up the sword, Namboothiripad sprays ash in front of Nagavalli to block her vision and simultaneously Sunny turns the platform over, revealing a blood-filled dummy resemblinh the Karanavar. Thus, Nakulan is saved, and he escapes. Ganga, in her extreme rage, as Nagavalli, stabs the dummy multiple times and thinks that she actually kills the Karanavar, and drinks the dummy's blood, thereby making her feel like she has accomplished her task. Ganga falls down into a hypnotic sleep while Nagavalli leaves her.\n\nGanga wakes up from her hypnotic sleep and learns that she is completely cured of the illness. Sunny expresses his intent to marry Sreedevi, and they all drive off happily.\n\nThe climax scene and major parts of the film were filmed in Padmanabhapuram Palace and Hill Palace, Tripunithura.\n\nShobana's voice was dubbed by two dubbing artistesBhagyalakshmi and Durga. Bhagyalakshmi dubbed her voice for Ganga, while Durga gave voice to the character's alter-ego, Nagavalli. Nagavalli's voice is heard only in the minor part of the film compared to Ganga's. Durga was not credited in the film or its publicity material and until 2016, the popular belief was that Bhagyalakshmi solely dubbed both voices.\n\nIn January 2016, in an article \"Ormapookkal\" published by \"Manorama Weekly\", Fazil revealed that initially Bhagyalakshmi dubbed for both Ganga and Nagavalli, but during post-production, some of the crew, including editor Shekar, had a feeling that both voices sounded somewhat similar even though Bhagyalakshmi tried altering her voice for Nagavalli. Since Nagavalli's dialogue are in Tamil language, Fazil hired Tamil dubbing artiste Durga for the part. But he forgot to inform it to Bhagyalakshmi, hence she was also unaware of it for a long time. Fazil did not credit Durga in the film; according to him, it was a difficult to make changes in the titles at that time, which was already prepared and her portion in the film was minor. The credits included only Bhagyalakshmi as the dubbing artiste for Shobana. Other dubbing artistes were Anandavally and Ambili, who dubbed for Vinaya Prasad and Rudra.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was composed by M. G. Radhakrishnan which went on to become one of the most popular film albums in Malayalam. The album consists of nine tracks. The lyrics sung are in Malayalam and Tamil written by Bichu Thirumala and Madhu Muttam for Malayalam and Vaali for Tamil.\n\n\"Manichitrathazhu\" performed well at the box office and became the highest-grossing Malayalam film ever, to that date. It ran for more than 365 days in some centres. The film gained a profit of 3 crore for the producer.\n\n\"Manichitrathazhu\" is hailed as one of the best films ever made in Malayalam cinema. The film has consistently fetched maximum ratings for its television screenings. Even twenty years after its release it has been screened more than 12 times a year on an average on Kerala's leading TV channel, Asianet. The film has received the maximum TRP rating on every screening; TRP ratings have increased every year, a rare record for a film produced in Kerala.\n\nIn a 2013 online poll by \"IBN Live\", \"Manichitrathazhu\" was listed second in India's Greatest Film of All Time. The poll was conducted as part of the celebration of Indian cinema completing 100 years. The poll constituted a list of 100 films from different Indian languages. As per the statistics of 2015, \"Manichitrathazhu\" is the most reviewed horror film ever in IMDb, surpassing Alfred Hitchcock \"Psycho\" (1960) with 2517 reviews.\n\n\nA spin-off titled \"Geethanjali\" was released on 14 November 2013, with Mohanlal reprising his role as Sunny.\n\n"}

{"id": "1812201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812201", "title": "Italy men's national basketball team", "text": "Italy men's national basketball team\n\nThe Italy national basketball team () represents Italy in men's international basketball tournaments. They are administered by the Italian Basketball Federation (FIP).\n\nItaly has qualified for 37 EuroBasket tournaments, winning two gold medals (1983, 1999), four silver medals (1937, 1946, 1991, 1997), and four bronze medals (1971, 1975, 1985, 2003) as achievements. While Italy has made nine trips to the World Cup the closest they have come to winning a medal was in 1970 and 1978, where they finished fourth. Although they have had success at the Summer Olympics in 12 attempts, coming away with two silver medals (1980, 2004).\n\nCurrently, Italy is ranked 12th in the FIBA World Rankings.\n\nThe first match of the Italian national basketball team was played on 4 April 1926 in Milan, and it ended with a victory over France 23–17.\nItaly's first participation in the Olympic Games was at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, placing seventh out of twenty-one teams. At the EuroBasket 1937 Italy placed second behind Lithuania, after being beaten by just one point in the final game. The silver medal was repeated at EuroBasket 1946.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II the Azzurri went through difficult times and not only failed to qualify for two Summer Olympics and three consecutive world championships but struggled in Europe as well. This was also reflected at the technical level with the alternation of several head coaches within only a few years. Of special importance was Italy's decision not to compete at the EuroBasket 1949, to mourn for the victims of the Superga air disaster. It was the first time that the squad missed a EuroBasket.\n\nIn 1957 as Nello Paratore took the head coach position (which he held for 11 years) Italy made only slight improvements from the previous decade.\n\nAt the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome Italy showed its most impressive performance to this point where it placed fourth, only behind USA, USSR and Brazil. Curiously, the organizational expenses of the Olympics in Rome resulted in the decision not to participate in the EuroBasket 1961.\n\nIn 1969, Giancarlo Primo became Italy's coach, focusing the game strategies on defense. Under his leadership the Italian national team grew stronger, claiming a place among the world's elite. Under Primo, the Azzuri won two European bronze medals and earned two fourth place finishes at the FIBA World Cup. Further, Italy finished fourth at the 1972 Summer Olympics where it lost the match for third place to Cuba by only one point. <br>\nAmong the leading players of the national team were the young Meneghin, Marzorati, Villalta and Bariviera.\n\nIn 1979 Sandro Gamba replaced Primo, leading Italy to its biggest triumphs till then: a silver at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, a gold at EuroBasket 1983 in Nantes, and a bronze at the EuroBasket 1985 in Stuttgart.\nAs in the years before, Meneghin, Marzorati and Villalta were the cornerstones of the team, complemented by players such as Riva and Brunamonti. This episode in time stands out to this day as the most successful in the history of the Italian national team.\n\nFollowing these outstanding accomplishments was another period of crisis, first under Coach Valerio Bianchini (replaced in 1985), and then another six years of modest success where the biggest accomplishment was silver at the EuroBasket 1991 in Rome, which was called to end Ettore Messina, who took over in 1992. In the same year Enrico Vinci stepped down as President of the Italian Basketball Federation after 16 years. The place was taken over by Giovanni Petrucci.\n\nEttore Messina became Italy's coach in 1992, winning a silver medal at EuroBasket 1997 in Barcelona. This medal was the main accomplishment of coach Messina, who served the team for five years and failed to qualify for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.\nA great disappointment was suffered at the 1998 World Cup in Athens when a team with Fučka, Myers and Meneghin was believed to aspire to the podium but only finished sixth. <br>\nBogdan Tanjević replaced Messina, leading Italy to the triumph at EuroBasket 1999, the first gold medal in 16 years. The second gold medal at a European Basketball Championship arrived after beating Spain in the final game. After a ninth place at EuroBasket 2001, held in Turkey, Carlo Recalcati was called to replace Tanjević.\nRecalcati could count on Italy's top talents Gregor Fučka and Carlton Myers, as well as valuable contributors such as Basile, Abbio and Chiacig.\n\nAt EuroBasket 2003, Italy showed a strong performances and defeated Germany and Greece but was later kicked out by Spain in the semifinals. The victory against France in the bronze medal game guaranteed the team's qualification at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Italy won a silver medal in that event and was stopped only in the final game by Argentina. Most important, this silver seemed to be worth much more than that of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow where several top teams, including the United States and Canada were absent for a boycott.<br>\nSince then, the Azzurri experienced years of only skimpy satisfaction: after the Summer Olympics in Greece, the team collected three ninth place finishes, two at the EuroBasket and one at the 2006 World Cup. Subsequently, the team failed to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the EuroBasket 2009 and the 2010 World Cup.<br>\nDespite the increasing internationalization of the NBA (especially towards European players) and a steady presence of Italian players, (including the historic first overall pick Andrea Bargnani of the 2006 NBA Draft) the national team performed poorly in these years. The reasons for this phenomenon are simple: low contribution of NBA athletes, ageing guards (Massimo Bulleri and Gianluca Basile, who were the highlights of Athens already in their thirties) and the lack of young talent. The reason for the seeming lack of talent were caused by the difficulty that Italian talents had in the national championships Serie A. There, they faced strong competition especially from American and European players. It comes as no coincidence that the team that absolutely dominated in the last years, Montepaschi Siena rarely had Italians in the starting lineup.<br>\nDuring these years, the Serie A went through some changes at the top executives level. Fausto Maifredi (in office since 1999) left and the Federation's first commissioner Dino Meneghin changed the rules by mandating for the commissioner to be the league's president as well.<br>\nMeanwhile, Italy failed to qualify for the European Championship in 2009, for the first time since 1961. Curiously, 2009 is the first year where the Azzurri failed to qualify for sports-related reasons. Both absences (1949 and 1961) were due to non-sporting reasons. Following the disappointment CT Recalcati left and was replaced by Simone Pianigiani. Pianigiani currently coaches both the national team and Mens Sana Basket, which for years dominated the Serie A.\n\nThe team with Coach Pianigiani was able to qualify for the EuroBasket 2011 due to an FIBA decision to expand the tournament.\n\nLater, Coach Pianigiani was able to secure Italy a spot at the EuroBasket 2015.\n\nFrom 5 November 2015, Ettore Messina returned to be head coach of the Italian national team simultaneously with his with his appointment as assistant-coach of the NBA club San Antonio Spurs.\n\nOn 9 July 2016, Italy was defeated by Croatia in the Finals of the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Turin, failing the qualification for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPrior to EuroBasket 2017, Ettore Messina announced he would leave the bench of Italy's national team after the tournament.\n\nAt the EuroBasket 2017, Coach Messina and his players were able to lock up third place in Group B of the preliminary phase and set up a Round of 16 date with Finland. There they reached the Quarterfinals, after an supreme performance from Marco Belinelli to lead the Azzurri. However, Italy would fall against Serbia 83-67, failing to setup an semifinals clash against Russia. \n\nItaly named Romeo Sacchetti new head coach of the national team after Eurobasket 2017. Sacchetti, who is also coach of Vanoli Cremona, will begin his new job during the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers. \n\nItaly will co-host the EuroBasket 2022, and they have automatically qualified for the 2022 tournament. It will make it the thirty-eighth successive time that Italy has qualified for the event overall. \nItaly will host several group phase matches in Milan.\n\nThe following players were called by coach Meo Sacchetti for the first two games against Russia and Estonia on 20 and 23 February 2020.\n\n\n\n1935 EuroBasket: finished 7th among 10 teams\n\n3 Gino Basso, 4 Bruno Caracoi, 5 Livio Franceschini,

{"id": "1812202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812202", "title": "Jacob L. Moreno", "text": "Jacob L. Moreno\n\nJacob Levy Moreno (born Iacob Levy; May 18, 1889 – May 14, 1974) was a Romanian-American psychiatrist, psychosociologist, and educator, the founder of psychodrama, and the foremost pioneer of group psychotherapy. During his lifetime, he was recognized as one of the leading social scientists.\n\nJacob Levy Moreno was born in Bucharest in the Kingdom of Romania. His father was Moreno Nissim Levy, a Sephardi Jewish merchant born in 1856 in Plevna in the Ottoman Empire (today Pleven, Bulgaria). Jacob's grandfather Buchis had moved to Plevna from Constantinople, where his ancestors had settled after they left Spain in 1492. It is thought that the Morenos left Plevna for Bucharest during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, following the Plevna rabbi, Haim Bejarano in search of a more hospitable environment. Jacob Moreno's mother, Paulina Iancu or Wolf, was also a Sephardi Jew, born in 1873, and originated from Călăraşi, Romania.\n\nIn 1895, a time of great intellectual creativity and political turmoil, the family moved to Vienna. He studied medicine, mathematics, and philosophy at the University of Vienna, becoming a Doctor of Medicine in 1917. He had rejected Freudian theory while still a medical student, and became interested in the potential of group settings for therapeutic practice.\n\nIn his autobiography, Moreno recalls this encounter with Sigmund Freud in 1912. \"I attended one of Freud’s lectures. He had just finished an analysis of a telepathic dream. As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them on the street and in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'\"\n\nIn Brooklyn, New York, Moreno married Beatrice Beecher in 1926. The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1938 he married Florence Bridge, with whom he had one child, Regina Moreno (born 1939). They too were divorced, and he married Zerka Toeman in 1949, with whom he had one child Jonathan D. Moreno (born 1952).\n\nWhile living in Vienna in the early 1900s Moreno started an improvisational theater company, \"Stegreiftheater\", the Theater of Spontaneity where he formulated a form of psychotherapy he called psychodrama, which employed improvised dramatizations, role-plays and other therapeutic, spontaneous dramatic expressions that utilized and unleashed the spontaneity and creativity of the group and its individual members. Moreno saw \"psychodrama as the next logical step beyond psychoanalysis.\" It was \"an opportunity to get into action instead of just talking, to take the role of the important people in our lives to understand them better, to confront them imaginatively in the safety of the therapeutic theater, and most of all to become more creative and spotantaneous human beings.\"\n\nIn his book \"Who Shall Survive?\" (Preludes, p.xxviii) Moreno wrote of the genesis of his Group Psychotherapy in 1913-14 in Vienna, formulating his ideas while working with groups of prostitutes.\n\nMoving to the U.S.A. in 1925, he began working in New York City. There, Moreno worked on his theory of interpersonal relations, and the development of his work in psychodrama, sociometry, group psychotherapy, sociodrama, and sociatry. In his autobiography he wrote \"only in New York, the melting pot of the nations, the vast metropolis, with all its freedom from all preconceived notions, could I be free to pursue sociometric group research in the grand style I had envisioned\".\n\nThe New York Times wrote “He found that acceptance of his theories was slow, particularly because some colleagues deplored his showmanship.”\n\nHe worked at the Plymouth Institute, Brooklyn, and at Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1929, he founded an Impromptu Theater at Carnegie Hall and later did work at the Guild Theater. He made studies of sociometry at Sing Sing Prison in 1931. In 1936, he founded the Beacon Hill Sanitarium, and the adjacent Therapeutic Theater.\n\nHe later held positions at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.\n\nIn 1932, Moreno first introduced group psychotherapy to the American Psychiatric Association, and co-authored the monograph \"Group Method and Group Pschotherapy\" with Helen Hall Jennings. He and Jennings were the first to use a stochastic network model (or, \"chance sociogram\", as they called it), predating the Erdős–Rényi model and the network model of Anatol Rapoport.\n\nFor the next 40 years he developed and introduced his Theory of Interpersonal Relations and tools for social sciences he called 'sociodrama', 'psychodrama', 'sociometry', and 'sociatry'. In his monograph entitled, \"The Future of Man's World\", he describes how he developed these sciences to counteract \"the economic materialism of Marx, the psychological materialism of Freud, and the technological materialism\" of our modern industrial age.\nHis autobiography describes his position as \"threefold: \n\nMoreno died in New York City in 1974, aged 84. He chose to die by abstaining from all food and water after a long illness. His ashes are buried at Feuerhalle Simmering in Vienna. His epitaph, at his request, reads \"Der mann, der freude und lachen in die psychiatre brechte\" (The man who brought joy and laughter to psychiatry).\n\nThere is evidence that the methods of J. L. Moreno have held up respectably over time. Subsequent research from the University of Vienna shows the enormous influence that Moreno's theory of the Encounter (\"Invitations to an Encounter\", 1914) had on the development of Martin Buber's I-Thou philosophy, and Buber's influence on philosophy, theology, and psychology. His wife, Zerka Moreno, wrote: \"While it is true that Buber broadened the idea of the Encounter, he did not create the instruments for it to occur.\" Moreno \"produced the various instruments we now use for facilitating the human encounter, sociometry, group psychotherapy, psychodrama, and sociodrama\". Zerka was herself an expert in psychodrama and sociometry, and continued her late husband's work.\n\nWith training centers and institutes on nearly every continent, there are many thousands of students who are expanding and developing training and teaching the Morenean Arts and Sciences across the disciplines, to more fully realize Moreno's vision to make these social sciences available for \"the whole of [hu]mankind.\"\n\nMoreno is also widely credited as one of the founders of the discipline of social network analysis, the branch of sociology that deals with the quantitative evaluation of an individual's role in a group or community by analysis of the network of connections between them and others.\n\nHis 1934 book \"Who Shall Survive?\" contains some of the earliest graphical depictions of social networks (sociograms). In this book, he introduced a famous explanation, why a pandemic of runaways emerged at the New York Training School for Girls in Hudson.\n\n\n\n"}

It is subdivided into 100 centimes.\n\nThe franc became the currency of Rwanda in 1916, when Belgium occupied the previously German colony and the Belgian Congo franc replaced the German East African rupie. Rwanda used the currency of Belgian Congo until 1960, when the Rwanda and Burundi franc was introduced. Rwanda began issuing its own francs in 1964.\n\nA proposal exists to introduce a common currency, a new East African shilling, for the five member states of the East African Community. While originally scheduled to occur by the end of 2012, as of January 2020, a common currency had not been introduced.\n\nIn 1964, coins were introduced for 1, 5 and 10 francs, with the 1 and 10 francs in cupronickel and the 5 francs in bronze. In 1969, aluminium 1 franc coins were introduced, followed in 1970 by ½ and 2 francs also in aluminium. A reduced sized copper-nickel 10 franc coin was issued in 1974.\nBrass 20 and 50 francs were introduced in 1977. New series of 1-50 Francs coins were issued in 2004 (dated 2003) and a new bimetallic coin of 100 Francs was introduced in 2008 (dated 2007) \n\nIn 1964, provisional notes were created for use in Rwanda by handstamping (20 to 100 francs) or embossing (500 and 1,000 francs) Rwanda-Burundi notes bearing their original dates and signatures. These were followed by regular issues for the same amounts dated 1964 to 1976.\n\n20- and 50-franc notes were replaced by coins in 1977, with 5,000-franc notes introduced in 1978. The nation's first-ever 2,000-franc note was introduced in mid-December 2007. In 2008 the bank replaced the 100-franc note with a bimetallic coin, and revoked the notes’ legal tender status on 31 December 2009. On September 24, 2013, the National Bank of Rwanda issued a redesigned 500 franc note depicting cows on the front and students with XO computers (from One Laptop per Child) on the back. In December 2014, the National Bank of Rwanda issued 2,000 and 5,000 franc notes with revised security features and the removal of French descriptions on the notes. In October 2015, the National Bank of Rwanda issued a revised 1000 franc note with improved security features and the removal of French descriptions on the notes.\n\nOn 7 February 2019, the National Bank of Rwanda announced new 500 francs and 1,000 francs banknotes would be introduced on 11 February 2019. These banknotes will have new security features and better quality to reduce wear. The design of the front of the 500-franc note is entirely new, and the overall color has been changed to brown to help distinguish it from the 1,000-franc note.\n\nRwandan francs per US dollar:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1812206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812206", "title": "WCBS-FM", "text": "WCBS-FM\n\nWCBS-FM (101.1 FM) is a radio station offering a classic hits format licensed to New York City and is owned and operated by Entercom. The station's studios are in the combined Entercom facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan, and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. The station is the home of the \"Scott Shannon in the Morning\" show.\n\nWCBS-FM was one of the first notable oldies stations in the country, with the format dating back to July 7, 1972. Between June 3, 2005, and July 12, 2007, the station aired the automated adult hits format \"Jack FM\". The new programming was unsuccessful, and WCBS-FM switched back to a personality-driven classic hits format. The station is continually ranked one of the highest-rated stations in the New York market, as well as one of the highest-rated classic hits stations in the United States.\n\nIn 1940, during the early days of FM broadcasting, what is now WCBS-FM was allocated an FM frequency and call sign, W67NY, becoming CBS's first FM station. The original transmitter site was located at 500 Fifth Avenue. The allocated dial position changed several times before the station finally went on the air at 46.7 MHz on December 1, 1941. On November 1, 1943, the callsign was changed to WABC-FM for Atlantic Broadcasting Company, the former owner of CBS's AM station (no relation to the present-day WABC). With the reallocation of the FM band, WABC-FM's new frequency became 96.9 MHz; finally, in September 1947 the station became WCBS-FM, and the frequency moved to the current 101.1. This allowed the station to reflect its corporate ownership by the Columbia Broadcasting System or CBS. The transmitter was moved to the Empire State Building in the early 1950s.\n\nFor many years, WCBS-FM simulcast its programming with its AM sister station. From the 1940s until the late 1950s, both stations aired a typical network-dominated general entertainment format with comedies, dramas, news and information, sports, talk shows and some music. As these types of radio shows either moved to television or were canceled outright, WCBS and WCBS-FM evolved toward a personality-oriented format featuring news and information, popular music, and sports. As rock and roll became popular, the stations played only softer songs of the genre.\n\nEach of the stations began broadcasting its own programming in 1966. The AM station retained its personality-oriented Middle of the road format until August 27, 1967. WCBS-FM initially programmed a younger-leaning easy listening format known as \"The Young Sound\", playing soft instrumental versions of current pop music songs. This automated format was syndicated to CBS stations across the country and to AFN (American Forces Network). On August 27, 1967, the AM station had to launch its news format (which was not full-time until 1972) on WCBS-FM because a small airplane had crashed into the AM radio tower a few hours earlier. \n\nIn 1969, WCBS-FM launched a freeform rock format, which was becoming increasingly popular, and all other CBS-owned FM stations followed suit. For the first time, WCBS-FM would have an airstaff. Bill Brown began his long tenure with the station, and Don K. Reed began his late in 1971; both remained there until 2005. Radio personalities such as Bobby \"Wizzard\" Wayne, Tom Tyler, Ed Williams, Steve Clark, Roby Yonge, K.O. Bayley (Bob Elliott from WOR-FM), Les Turpin, Bob \"Bob-A-Lew\" Lewis also briefly joined the WCBS-FM \"freeform\" format. Besides Bill Brown and Don K. Reed, Wayne and Williams also stayed into the early part of the oldies format.\n\nWCBS-FM was never successful with their rock format, where it competed with stations such as WPLJ and WNEW-FM; these two stations had most of the rock audience. As a result, WCBS-FM switched to oldies on July 7, 1972, becoming one of the first full-time stations in the country to use that format. The change coincided with rival WOR-FM's decision to drop pre-1964 oldies from its playlist a few months prior (as they became WXLO). Johnny Michaels, formerly of WMCA, played the first record, Dion's \"Runaround Sue\". The entire staff from the rock format remained at the station. \n\nAt first, the station focused on rock-and-roll hits from 1955 to 1964 and mixed in some softer hits of the late 1960s and early 1970s, as well as a few then-current songs. WCBS-FM also played a moderate number of adult standards from the rock era. The station played two current hits per hour known as \"future gold\". By the late 1970s however, the station dropped most of the adult standards, with a few exceptions, and added rock hits from the late 1960s. WCBS-FM's oldies format weathered many trends and corporate moves. By 1979, three FM stations owned by CBS had begun playing disco music. In the course of 1981, all of CBS's FM stations, except for WCBS-FM and their FM station in San Francisco, adopted a CHR format known as \"Hot Hits\". The oldies format on WCBS-FM continued to be a success.\n\nOne ongoing favorite feature was a countdown of the top 500 songs of all time, as voted by the station's listeners. The countdown always took place on Thanksgiving weekend (with a new survey taken every other year). On even years, up to 1990, the survey from the previous year was played. In the first Top 500, The Five Satins' doo wop classic \"In the Still of the Night\" was #1 and \"Earth Angel\" by The Penguins was #2. \"In the Still of the Night\" remained at #1 every year after that. In 1992, WCBS-FM ran a Top 500 Countdown based on all their surveys from 1973 to 1991. They repeated 1993's Top 500 in 1994, conducting their last listener surveys in 1995 and 1996. After compiling an all-time survey based on past surveys in 1997, the station abandoned listener surveys, repeating the 1997 all-time survey on subsequent Thanksgiving weekends. For New Years weekend in 1999–2000, the station compiled and played a Top 1001 countdown based on original New York radio charts, with \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles at number one. This survey would be repeated on Thanksgiving weekend in 2002. In 2003, the station played a Top 500 Countdown covering the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and some 1950s songs, and in 2004 played a Top 500 Countdown with mostly songs from 1964 to 1979 with some pre-1964 songs and 1980s songs. When the station returned to a modified oldies and classic hits format in 2007, the station compiled a new listener-voted survey and played the results Labor Day weekend. This survey featured mostly songs from the 1960s and 1970s with a moderate selection of songs from the 1955–1963 time period. There was also a moderate amount of 1980s music on the survey.\n\nJoe McCoy took over as program director in 1981, and at that point WCBS-FM began to gradually shift its focus to the 1964–1969 era, but would also feature more pre-1964 oldies than most other such stations of that decade. The station continued to also feature hits of the 1970s and some hits of the 1980s while cutting future gold selections to one per hour. Also in the 1980s, after WABC and later WNBC abandoned music in favor of talk, WCBS-FM began employing many disc jockeys who were widely known on other New York City stations (and sometimes nationally), most notably Musicradio 77 WABC alumni Ron Lundy, Dan Ingram, Bruce \"Cousin Brucie\" Morrow, and Harry Harrison, as well as former WMCA \"Good Guys\" Dan Daniel and Jack Spector. Bob Shannon, whose only previous New York City radio experience before coming to WCBS-FM was as a fill-in DJ at WYNY, became well-known himself through his 19-year run as the station's afternoon disk jockey. Bill Brown (who had started with the station in 1969, during their rock days) and Don K. Reed (who started at the station 6 months before the switch to oldies) remained with the station during their entire first period as an oldies station.\n\nIn 1989, WCBS-FM limited current music to late nights and overnights. While most oldies stations were playing songs from exclusively 1955 to 1973, WCBS-FM continued to play a moderate number of songs from the late 1970s as well as about one 1980s hit per hour. Most of the 1980s music came from core oldies artists. \n\nThe station's ratings increased during the 1990s (and were sustained into the 2000s) and market research studies showed a small and growing audience in the 35-to-49-year-old demographic as a new generation's \"songs they grew up with\" moved into the oldies format. The station even hit number one overall in the ratings on at least several occasions during the 1990s. During this period, the station's on-air jingles were made by JAM Creative Productions in Dallas. Such was the appeal of the packages of jingles that stations around the world wanted that WCBS-FM sound for their stations, including for example the UK's Radio Victory.\n\nBy 2000, as demographics for 1950s and early 1960s oldies started to eclipse the target age groups that many advertisers covet, WCBS-FM began cutting pre-1964 songs while adding more music from the 1970s and 1980s. In January 2001, they stopped playing currents and 90's hits on the overnight, dropping them altogether. The station also had cut specialty shows such as Bobby Jay's \"Soul Of The City\" on Wednesdays, \"Thursday Night 60's\", Friday night's \"Heart & Soul of Rock & Roll\", \"Monday Night 70's\", and Bobby Jay's late night Saturday show \"Jukebox Saturday Night\". Eventually, they began to shorten the regular playlist and moved away from pre-1964 and toward 1970–1989 songs even more. In the summer of 2002, Don K. Reed's long-running Sunday night \"Doo-Wop Shop\" program was cancelled. The station even began to de-emphasize the phrase 'oldies' in promotion of the station.\n\nThe station canceled more specialty shows in 2003, such as the \"Top 20 Oldies Countdown\". In the summer of 2003, to appease some fans, they did add a specialty 1955–1964 oldies show called \"Heart & Soul of Rock & Roll\" with Norm N. Nite (who had been with WCBS off and on since 1973). Also in that year, Harry Harrison and Dan Ingram both retired. In spring 2004, WCBS-FM narrowed the playlist even more. The station's playlist consisted of music almost entirely from 1964 to 1979, dividing about equally between the 1960s and 1970s, playing only a handful of pre-1964 oldies and songs from the 1980s. Joe McCoy left the station shortly thereafter and was replaced by Dave Logan. WCBS-FM's last morning show host of this period was ex-Monkee Micky Dolenz, who had appeal to this audience segment by virtue of 1970s reruns of his band's eponymous television series and the mid-1980s Monkees revival. His last broadcast on June 3, 2005 was a remote at a Manhattan restaurant to celebrate his 100th day at the station. However, by the end of that day, the station would be changed dramatically.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Infinity Broadcasting, which was CBS' radio division during that time, contracted with Sparknet Communications, which owns the licensing of an Adult Hits format branded as \"Jack FM\", a format that has seen on-air success in Canadian areas since the early 2000s. In return, Sparknet Communications gave Infinity Broadcasting permission to bring the \"Jack FM\" format to some of Infinity's radio markets in the United States. That April, Infinity flipped radio stations KCBS-FM in Los Angeles and WQSR in Baltimore to the \"Jack FM\" format. On Friday, June 3, 2005, Micky Dolenz, Mike Fitzgerald, and Randy Davis all signed off their shows expecting to be back the following Monday. However, Bill Brown signed off at about 3:53 p.m. saying, \"CBS-FM 101.1, Fontella Bass... Do you ever feel the urge to just kinda scream, \"RESCUE ME!?\"... I'm beginning to get that feeling, here's Fontella Bass.\" The station segued to \"Use Me\" by Bill Withers. Then, at 4:00 p.m., the station played the usual station identification, and then a mix of Oldies and Greatest Hits referring to change, including \"Movin' Out\", \"Get a Job\", \"Glory Days\" and \"Hit the Road Jack\", among others. Frank Sinatra's \"Summer Wind\" was the last song played before the format change. At 4:30 p.m., the station stunted with a 30-minute montage of lines from various movies and other sources.\nThen, at 5:00 p.m., a pre-recorded station identification was played followed by a short introduction of the new adult hits format by new station voiceover Howard Cogan, and the announcement of the new station name: \"Welcome to the NEW \"101.1 Jack FM\", Playing What We Want.\" The first song aired was Beastie Boys' \"Fight for Your Right\". The format featured nearly 2,000 unique songs in the playlist. With this move, WCBS-FM had left the oldies format after 33 years. In an attempt to cater to fans of the old format, the station created an internet-only oldies station on its website and soon after simulcast the format on 101.1 HD2. Initially, the internet-only station was DJ-less like Jack FM on the analog 101.1 and HD1 station. The station in between songs played jingles plus pre-recorded voice overs done by their production director. But in a letter on the WCBS-FM website posted on June 5, 2005, station VP Chad Brown announced the webstream would try to bring back most of the original shows and DJs and that eventually the station would also be able to be heard on HD radio. The change left WBZO as the only FM station playing any type of oldies format in the market. Its signal in the Metropolitan area was weak, however, because it operated out of Long Island, and used an outright oldies format, unlike WCBS's old \"Greatest Hits\" format. On the AM dial, there were a few oldies stations receivable at night, like Buffalo's WKBW at the time. \n\nMany criticized the change of formats, among them Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, according to the \"New York Post\", responded to the change by declaring he would \"never listen to that fucking CBS radio ever again\" (the quote was censored in the \"Post\"). \"Jack\" picked up on the mayor's comments, making jokes about his quip, \"Hey, Mayor Bloomberg. I heard you took a shot at us in the \"Post\". What's with all the swearin' like a sailor? Fleet Week is over. It's just music.\" In an interview with the New York Daily News, Cousin Brucie likened the format switch to \"replacing Yankee Stadium with a fruit stand\". Cousin Brucie moved over to Sirius Satellite Radio's '60s on 6 channel to continue playing oldies. Recognizing the controversy of the sudden change, on June 14, 2005, the station announced that it would be unique among those with the Jack format in that it would occasionally include '50s and early '60s songs in its rotation as well as songs by performers like Frank Sinatra that are normally not part of the Jack format, though a later Web update retracted this and songs from before the late '60s were no longer played.\n\nIn March 2006, Chad Brown hired Brian Thomas as program director, replacing Steve Smith. Brown was replaced by Les Hollander later that year after a big layoff of personnel at CBS Radio. In 2007, Jennifer Donohue (from WWFS) was named as Jack's new general manager. Later that year, Maire Mason replaced Donohue.\n\nThe \"Jack\" format experiment at WCBS-FM is widely regarded, inside and outside the industry, as one of the greatest failures in modern New York radio history, as the station fell to the very bottom of the ratings of full-market-coverage FM stations in the New York market. In early July 2007, various websites quoted sources as saying the station was ready to shift from its current \"Jack FM\" format and return to its previous format. CBS Radio, owner of the station, declined to comment on the rumors. Initial reports about the WCBS-FM format change initially surfaced on July 6, 2007, in the \"Radio Business Report\" online newsletter and at CrainsNewYorkBusiness.com. CBS Radio confirmed the rumors on July 9, 2007, that live announcers would indeed return to 101.1 and the HD1 channel on July 12, meaning that the \"Jack\" format in New York had run its course after two years, likely due to its lackluster ratings. The returning format would concentrate on music from 1964 to 1989, with selected older hits from 1955 through 1963. There would be a wider variety of hits, unlike the CBS-FM of 2005, which had a limited playlist from 1964 through 1979.\n\nOn July 12, at approximately 12:40 p.m., \"Jack FM\" ended with \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey, ending in the same spot where the song abruptly ended during the series finale of \"The Sopranos\". Then, after a few seconds of dead air and a few seconds of a \"Wayback Machine\" audio special effect, the oldies format returned with the resumption of the last song played before the change to Jack FM, Frank Sinatra's \"Summer Wind\" (starting like a phonograph record played very slowly but quickly accelerated to normal speed). This was followed by greetings from former WCBS-FM DJs Harry Harrison and Ron Lundy. Next were audio-clip montages of music, movies, television shows, and events for each year from 1964 through 1979 followed by a single montage, similar to the aforementioned, which paid homage to the entire decade of the 1980s, with WCBS-FM jingles interspersed between. Former Mayor Ed Koch then welcomed back the format, noting the \"mistake\" CBS Radio had made with the switch. Then at exactly 1:01 p.m., the legally mandated station identification played, and WCBS-FM's classic hits format officially returned with \"Do It Again\" by the Beach Boys. This sequence is now repeated on-air every July 12. WOCL in Orlando used the same sequence (with the montage starting with 1966 and running clips for every year through 1989) the following year, dropping alternative rock for classic hits, and later WJMK in Chicago also used the same sequence (with a few Chicago-themed modifications) on March 14, 2011 when they switched from Jack FM to a classic hits format. \n\nUpon hearing of WCBS-FM's confirmation that oldies would return, Cousin Brucie commented, \"I’m thrilled that this music is getting a chance again.\" He added, \"This music has been treated terribly, and people in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s are still a very viable product in this society.\" Mayor Bloomberg, who had criticized the Jack FM format after its debut, also welcomed oldies back with open arms, proclaiming July 12, 2007, as \"WCBS-FM Returns to New York City Day\". Arbitron's switch from diary to PPM facilitated a move back to oldies and classic hits as sister station WOGL in Philadelphia had demonstrated ratings success in the new methodology by reaching the top five. WCBS-FM's return to classic hits has also been a success, ranking it among the top five stations in every quarter of the new ratings for Arbitron, consistently either first or second in overall audience. In 2010, the station was number one among all stations in the New York region, 25-54 and 12+ (Arbitron PPM report, May 2010). The station went to number one again in the July 2014 & August 2017 ratings periods.\n\nAs of August 2009, WCBS-FM started carrying New York Giants football on occasions when sister station WFAN could not carry the game. For the 2010 season, two Giants pre-season games and two regular season games were carried on WCBS-FM including the first game at the New Meadowlands Stadium against the New York Jets on August 16.\n\nIn the fall of 2014, the station dropped the pre-1964 oldies altogether and also dropped many of the songs from the 1960s, cutting the number down to one to two per hour. In addition, the station broadened their format to include select hits from the 1990s, up to about 1999. On November 19, 2016, the \"Saturday Night Block Party\" was discontinued after four years in favor of regular programming. On July 9, 2017, Backtrax USA, hosted by former WHTZ jock Kid Kelly, debuted on WCBS-FM on Sunday nights. Prior to 2016, WCBS-FM used JAM Creative Productions, Inc. for their jingles. However, to focus on a new and changing demographic, they now use Reel World for their jingles. As of 2018, WCBS-FM no longer uses any JAM Jingles, and the station also no longer plays any music from the 1960s, while also starting to cut back on the amount of early 1970s music played. Gradually and subtly, WCBS-FM is increasing the frequency of 1980s and 1990s hits per day and is also adding music from the 2000s.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, currently the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States; the sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it would be tax-free. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom is the surviving entity, separating WCBS radio (both 101.1 FM and 880 AM) from WCBS-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\n\nWCBS-FM broadcasts at 6,700 watts. WBEB, an Adult Contemporary station in Philadelphia, also broadcasts at 101.1 FM. WBEB's signal reaches far north into New Jersey, especially along Interstate 287 south of Morristown, and in Northwestern New Jersey. In those areas WBEB interferes with WCBS-FM, and in some spots, WBEB's signal actually seems stronger. This is because WBEB broadcasts at 14,000 watts, although from a lower antenna height.\n\nWCBS-FM's subcarrier also airs Spanish language Catholic programming for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut from Radio Maria Hispana, a local unit of Radio Maria USA.\n\nA few hours after the change back from Jack FM, WCBS-FM's '60s and '70s music was brought back online at wcbsfm.com. CBS FM's longtime music director Jeff Mazzei was retained as program director of the wcbsfm.com oldies stream. Over the next couple of weeks, the station started playing pre-1964 oldies again. Additionally, the '60s and '70s oldies became broader and '80s and early '90s oldies were also mixed in, and the format got much deeper. However, it was commercial-free and had no airstaff. WCBS-FM HD2 also began broadcasting in HD radio on December 12, 2005 (before most of the other NY stations, which launched in early 2006).\n\nAir personalities did on-air auditions on the WCBS-FM HD2 oldies station on July 11, 2007, as a preview of the next day's changeover. The format then moved to the analog and HD1 channels. The HD2 station also simulcast the oldies format until 2:00 p.m. that day, at which time Jack FM moved to HD2. At 3:00 p.m. that day, Jack FM resumed streaming on their website ilikejack.com. In February 2008, Howard Cogan was replaced by Pat St. John as the pre-recorded voice of the Jack character on WCBS-FM HD2 and ilikejack.com. On May 7, 2008, the Jack branding was dropped from WCBS-FM HD2 and was just called 101.1 HD2 or WCBS-FM HD2 due to the end of a licensing agreement with the owner of the Jack name and slogan, Sparknet Communications. During the holiday season in 2008, WCBS-FM's HD1 and analog signal played Christmas music, resulting in the oldies format being temporarily moved back to the HD2 channel. In late June 2009, the HD2 channel was rebranded again as \"ToNY\", meaning \"to New York\" but pronounced as \"Tony\". The channel continued to feature an adult hits format until December 21, 2012, when it was dropped and replaced with a simulcast of WCBS News Radio 880.\n\nOn October 2, 2008 around 3 a.m., WCBS-FM HD3 was launched as a simulcast of WCBS News Radio 880. On January 2, 2013, WCBS-FM HD3 flipped to CBS Sports Radio.\n\n\n"}

It is subdivided into one hundred \"centimes\", but no centime denominations were ever issued.\n\nThe first Guinean franc was introduced in 1959 to replace the CFA franc. There were 1, 5, 10 and 25 francs coins (made of aluminium bronze) with banknotes (dated 1958) in 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 francs denominations. A second series of banknotes dated 1er MARS 1960 was issued on 1 March 1963, without the 10,000 francs. This series was printed without imprint by Thomas De La Rue, and includes more colors, enhanced embossing, and improved security features. A new issue of coins in 1962 was made of cupronickel.\n\nIn 1971, the franc was replaced by syli at a rate of 1 syli = 10 francs.\n\nThe Guinean franc was reintroduced as Guinea's currency in 1985, at par with the syli. The coins came in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 francs made of brass clad steel, with brass 25 francs (1987) and cupronickel 50 francs (1994) added later. Banknotes were first issued in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs. Guinean notes of this series are unique from those of other countries in that the date of issue features very prominently as part of the overall design on the lower left hand corner of each note.\n\nA second series issued in 1998 dropped the 25 and 50 francs banknotes, since they had been replaced by coins. In 2006, the third issue were introduced in denomination of 500, 1000 and 5000 francs that are similar to previous issues, but the most notable change was the use of full printing of the notes and enhanced security features on each of the notes. Another change for this issue was the size of the 500 francs was reduced. On 11 June 2007, a 10,000 franc was issued.\n\nIn 2010, a commemorative series of 1000, 5000, and 10,000 francs banknotes celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of both the Guinean franc and the Banque Centrale de la République de Guinée (BCRG) was issued featuring a diamond-shaped logo of the event on the front side of each denomination inside of the watermark window to the right.\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea issued a new 10,000 francs banknote which is similar to the original issue, but it has been revised. The banknote's main color was changed from green to red, and instead of a diamond-shaped patch placed on the letters \"RG\" (for Republique de Guinée), it is now replaced by a holographic patch and the holographic security strip now showing on the reverse side. On May 11, 2015, the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea issued a 20,000 franc banknote. On January 21, 2018, the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea issued a revised banknote of 20,000 francs, with a reduced size and advanced security features. On March 1, 2019, on the 59th anniversary of the introduction of its national currency, the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea issued a revised banknote for 10,000 francs and issued a new banknote for 2,000 francs.\n\nCurrently, the smallest denomination in circulation is the 500 francs note due to diminished purchasing power.\n\n, 1 Euro is equal to 10,417.46 Guinean Francs, which means that the highest valued banknote, of 20,000 Francs, has a value of less than 2 Euros.\n\n\nHistorical:\n\n"}
{"id": "1812213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812213", "title": "Nikolay Danilevsky", "text": "Nikolay Danilevsky\n\nNikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky (; 28 November 1822 – 7 November 1885) was a Russian Empire naturalist, economist, ethnologist, philosopher, historian and ideologue of Pan-Slavism and the Slavophile movement. He expounded a circular view of world history.\n\nHe is remembered also for his opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and for his theory of historical-cultural types.\n\nDanilevsky was born in the village of Oberets in Oryol Governorate. As a member of a noble family, he was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. After graduation, he went on to an appointment with the Military Ministry Office. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a military career, he began to attend the University of St Petersburg, where he studied physics and mathematics.\n\nHaving passed his master's exams, Danilevsky prepared to defend his thesis on the flora of the Black Sea area of European Russia but in 1849 he was arrested there for his membership in the Petrashevsky Circle, which studied the work of French socialists and included Fyodor Dostoevsky. Its most active members were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Danilevsky was imprisoned for 100 days in the Peter and Paul Fortress and then was sent to live under police surveillance in Vologda, where he worked in provincial administration.\n\nIn 1852, he was appointed to an expedition, led by Karl Ernst von Baer, to assess the condition of the fishing industry on the Volga and the Caspian Sea. The expedition lasted four years, and Danilevsky was then reassigned to the Agricultural Department of the State Property Ministry. For over 20 years, he was responsible for expeditions to the White Sea, the Black Sea, the Azov Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The expertise that he gained from the expeditions led to the publication of his 1872 book, \"Examination of Fishery Conditions in Russia\".\n\nAside from his work on fisheries and the seal trade, he was the head of the commission setting the rules for the use of running water in Crimea from 1872 to 1879. He ran the Nikitsky Botanical Gardens from 1879 to 1880, and he was part of a commission appointed to deal with the phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s. His papers on Russian climatology, geology, geography, and ethnology earned him a gold medal from the Russian Geographical Society.\n\nDanilevsky died in Tbilisi, Tiflis Governorate, and was buried at his estate, in Mshanka.\n\nDanilevsky's \"Darwinism: Critical research,\" which brings together more than 1200 pages of arguments against Darwin's theory, mostly assembled from the literature that already existed at the time, was published in 1885. It was meant to be the first volume of a longer work, the second volume containing Danilevsky's own theories, which he characterised as \"natural theology\", but it was unfinished at his death. When it was published posthumously, it contained only preliminary studies.\n\nDanilevsky had been influenced by the work of von Baer, who had developed his own teleological theory of evolution and gone on to criticise Darwin's work in the 1870s. Danilevsky took from von Baer's theory the notion of \"Zielstrebigkeit\". The German word means \"singleness of purpose\" but Danilevsky imbued it with a religious aspect and argued that evolution, as well as the original creation of the world, has a rational purpose and follows the will of a divine creator.\n\nDanilevsky first published \"Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World\" in the journal \"Zarya\" in 1869. Later republished as a monograph, it brought him international fame.\n\nHe pioneered the use of biological and morphological metaphors in the comparison of cultures. Danilevsky compared cultures and nations to biological species, denied their commonality and argued that each nation or civilisation is united by its language and culture, which it cannot pass on to any other nation. He thus characterised Peter the Great's reforms in Russia as doomed to failure, as they had attempted to impose alien values on the Slavic world.\n\nDanilevsky distinguished four categories of historical-cultural activity:\n\n\nThey gave rise to ten historical-cultural types:\n\n\nDanilevsky applied his teleological theory of evolution by stating that each type went through various predetermined stages of youth, adulthood, and old age, the last being the end of that type. He characterised the Slavic type as being at the youth stage, and he developed a socio-political plan for its development, involving unification of the Slavic world, with its future capital at Constantinople (now Istanbul), ruled by an Orthodox emperor. While other cultures would degenerate in their blind struggle for existence, the Slavic world should be viewed as a Messiah among them. Danilevsky, however, believed that there is no genuine or absolute progress, as history is circular.\n\nAspects of Danilevsky's book prefigured some of the theories in Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\". Arnold J. Toynbee mentions them in \"A Study of History\". The Danilevsky hypothesis became the subject of much controversy and polarised its readers. On one hand, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy praised it, but on the other hand, Occidentalists, such as Nikolai Kareev, Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943) and Nikolai Mikhailovsky (1842-1904), strongly opposed it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1812216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812216", "title": "Coneheads (film)", "text": "Coneheads (film)\n\nConeheads is a 1993 American science-fiction comedy film from Paramount Pictures, produced by Lorne Michaels, directed by Steve Barron, and starring Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin and Michelle Burke. The film is based on the NBC \"Saturday Night Live\" comedy sketches about aliens stranded on Earth, who have Anglicized their Remulakian surname to \"Conehead\". Michelle Burke took over the role played by Laraine Newman on \"SNL\". The film also features roles and cameos by actors and comedians from television series of the time.\n\nUpon discovering a UFO in American airspace, the National Guard sends fighter jets to investigate, and they fire on the craft when it does not respond. Activating a cloaking device too late, the spaceship crashes into the Atlantic Ocean, near Manhattan. The aliens aboard, Beldar Clorhone and his life-mate Prymaat, survive and quickly adapt to the human way of life, despite standing out with their conical shaped heads. Beldar was assigned by the Highmaster to conquer Earth as a Protoid Re-fueling Station under the title of 'Fuel Survey Underlord of the Wilderness Planet at the end of the Noctolium Solar Chain'. Beldar gets work as an appliance repairman, and when his grateful boss Otto discovers that Beldar has no documentation, he arranges for a false identity, which sends up a red flag that quickly alerts the INS. Meanwhile, after communicating with their world (Remulak) and discovering that a rescue vessel will not arrive for seven \"Zurls\" (many years), Prymaat informs Beldar that she is pregnant. They now need to completely adapt and safely blend in, in order to raise their child among humans. Ambitious INS agent Gorman Seedling and his assistant Eli attempt to capture Beldar and Prymaat, but they are able to elude the two agents.\n\nMonths later, Beldar has become a respected taxi driver, and the couple live in his boss's basement. After the birth of their daughter Connie, they buy a home and move to suburban Paramus, New Jersey, adopting the surname Conehead. Beldar begins a new career, this time as a driving instructor. Meanwhile, Gorman gets a promotion and decides to leave the Coneheads' case to the agent replacing him. His promotion, however, is soon held-up by the case's extreme expense, forcing Gorman to continue until it is closed.\n\nNow a teenager, all Connie Conehead wants to do is fit in with her peers, much to the objections of her father, especially when she begins seeing Ronnie, an auto mechanic. This causes tension between Connie and Beldar, who strongly disapproves of Ronnie, with Beldar going so far as tearing the roof off of Ronnie's car and threatening him after he tries to make love with Connie (an act that angers Connie greatly). Despite this, Connie and Ronnie make up after talking. Meanwhile, Beldar is preoccupied with winning a golfing trophy at his country club, while Prymaat becomes concerned about her attractiveness to Beldar due to one of Beldar's driving students making a pass at him.\n\nGorman and Eli track the Coneheads down to their home and pose as Jehovah's Witnesses to gain entry to the Conehead home. During the conversation, Prymaat discovers their communication device to Remulak is beeping, and she promptly tells Beldar that he has a phone call from 'the Big Phone'. This causes Beldar to promptly eject Gorman and Eli from their home. Beldar then receives word that their rescue vessel is on its way.\n\nAt a costume party that night, Connie is told that they will be rescued soon. She disobeys her parents or \"parental units\" by returning home with Ronnie. Once there Connie almost consummates their relationship using her parents' \"senso-rings\". Beldar and Prymaat walk in on them, just as the INS shows up to take the Coneheads into custody. Ronnie helps them stall them while the rescue vessel arrives. Their rescue vessel arrives just in time, and Gorman and Eli are taken aboard with Beldar, Prymaat, and Connie.\n\nOn Remulak, Beldar is welcomed home, presenting Highmaster Mintot with a variety of 'gifts' from earth, including Gorman and Eli as slaves. Mintot is at first satisfied with what Beldar has accomplished during his time on Earth, until he notices that Beldar got his teeth capped (something Beldar had done from advice from Otto as a part of blending in). He accuses Beldar of treason and sentences him to fight the ferocious Garthok (\"narful the Garthok\"), much to Prymaat's distress.\n\nAfter the Garthok easily and gruesomely kills others who were sentenced to fight it, Beldar uses his Earthly golfing skills to save himself, killing the creature. For his victory, he is then granted a request: Beldar wishes to return to Earth to oversee its conquest, taking Gorman back with him as a minion. Mintot agrees, and Eli is left behind, becoming the Highmaster's personal assistant, acclimating to his new role rather quickly. Beldar leaves for Earth with Prymaat, Connie, and Gorman in tow. He soon demonstrates that Connie's feelings are more important to him than planetary conquest by quickly faking an Earth attack. Beldar orders his invasion force to retreat and proceed to their secondary target in another part of the galaxy, while making it look like his spaceship has been destroyed by a superior weapon. For sparing his life, Gorman agrees to give the Coneheads Green Cards in exchange for Beldar proving he has a marketable talent no other American citizen possesses, to which Beldar confidently agrees.\n\nTwo years later, Ronnie arrives to take Connie to the prom. Beldar gives Ronnie 55 words of advice, and then uses a massive flash bulb arrangement on his home-built Polaroid camera to document the happy event. As Connie and a now-sunburned Ronnie depart, Beldar and Prymaat look at the oversized photo, saying, \"Memories, we will enjoy them\".\n\nWhile there are some differences, \"Coneheads\" mostly follows the same plot as in the animated special that was created ten years earlier. Similarities include the Coneheads being stranded on Earth, Beldar working as an appliance repair man, and Connie dating an earthling named Ronnie.\n\nThe film mostly takes place in Paramus, New Jersey. Some scenes were filmed in New York City and the New Jersey towns of Jersey City and Wrightstown.\n\nThe film debuted at No. 6 on its opening weekend, while its domestic box office grossed $7,100,501. By the end of its domestic theatrical run, the film had grossed $21,274,717.\n\n\"Coneheads\" received mostly negative reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a low score of 35%, based on 31 reviews with a consensus that reads \"Listless, crude, and overall uninspired, \"Coneheads\" offers further evidence that stretching an \"SNL\" sketch to feature length can be tougher than narfling a garthok\". Roger Ebert gave the film 1½ stars out of 4, describing \"Coneheads\" as \"dismal, dreary and fairly desperate\" and the actors as unable to overcome an uninspired screenplay. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said the film \"has its dopey charms\", and that it is suitable for people who found \"Wayne's World\" too demanding.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"an unusually companionable jape; in this world it makes perfect sense that the Coneheads' friends and neighbors never really register that there's anything terribly different about them. They're all-American eccentrics — even if they happen to come from the planet Remulak\".\n\nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on scale of A+ to F.\n\nThe film received some critical re-evaluation during the 2010s, with multiple writers noting its satirical take on an immigrant family experience and immigration enforcement (meant as an exaggeration of Reagan-era politics) became eerily politically relevant following the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Coneheads\" was released on July 20, 1993 by Warner Bros. Records. It features the songs \"Tainted Love\" by Soft Cell, \"It's a Free World, Baby\" by R.E.M. and \"Soul to Squeeze\" by the band Red Hot Chili Peppers which would go on to reach 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album itself would peak at 162 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nNone of David Newman's score was included on the above album, but it was issued on a 2015 Intrada album paired with his scores for \"Talent for the Game\" and \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\".\n\n"}

Its ISO 4217 currency code is \"DJF\". Historically, it was subdivided into 100 \"centimes\".\n\nFrom 1884, when the French Somaliland protectorate was established, the French franc circulated alongside the Indian rupee and the Maria Theresa thaler. These coexisted with 2 francs = 1 rupee and 4.2 francs = 1 Maria Theresa thaler.\n\nFrom 1908, francs circulating in Djibouti were legally fixed at the value of the French franc. Starting in 1910, banknotes were issued for the then colony by the Bank of Indochina. Chamber of Commerce paper money and tokens were issued between 1919 and 1922.\n\nIn 1948, the first coins were issued specifically for use in Djibouti, in the name of the \"Côte Française des Somalis\". In 1949, an independent Djiboutian franc came into being when the local currency was pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 214.392 francs = 1 dollar. This was the value which the French franc had under the Bretton Woods system until a few months before. Consequently, the Djiboutian economy was not affected by the further devaluations of the French franc.\n\nIn 1952, the Public Treasury took over the production of paper money. French Somaliland's change of name in 1967 to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas was reflected on both the territory's coins and notes. In 1971 and 1973, the franc was revalued against the US dollar, first to a rate of 197.466 to the dollar, then 177.721, a rate which has been maintained ever since. A further change in coin and banknote design followed independence in 1977.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1922, the Chamber of Commerce issued tokens struck in zinc, aluminium, bronze and aluminium-bronze in denominations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 centimes and 1 franc. Shapes included round, hexagonal and octagonal.\n\nIn 1948, aluminium 1, 2 and 5 francs were introduced. Aluminium-bronze 20 francs were introduced in 1952, followed by 10 francs in 1965. Cupro-nickel 50 and 100 francs were introduced in 1970, with aluminium-bronze 500 francs added in 1989.\n\nFrom 2013, new coins of 250 francs were put in circulation to complement the other denominations.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1915, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 5, 20 and 100 francs. Chamber of Commerce notes were introduced in 1919 in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 centimes and 1 franc. The decline in the value of the French franc following World War I caused 500 and 1000 franc banknotes to be introduced in 1927 and 1938, respectively. 10 franc notes were introduced in 1946.\n\nWhen the Public Treasury took over the production of paper money in 1952, the 5, 10 and 20 franc notes ceased production and 5000 franc notes were introduced. In 1970, the 50 and 100 franc notes were replaced by coins. In 1977, the National Bank took over production of banknotes. The only subsequent changes have been the introduction of 10,000 franc notes in 1984 and the replacement of the 500 franc note with a coin in 1989.\n\n\n"}

This article demonstrates that assumption of normal distributions does not have that consequence, although the multivariate normal distribution, including the bivariate normal distribution, does.\n\nTo say that the pair formula_1 of random variables has a bivariate normal distribution means that every linear combination formula_2 of formula_3 and formula_4 for constant (i.e. not random) coefficients formula_5 and formula_6 has a univariate normal distribution. In that case, if formula_3 and formula_4 are uncorrelated then they are independent. However, it is possible for two random variables formula_3 and formula_4 to be so distributed jointly that each one alone is marginally normally distributed, and they are uncorrelated, but they are not independent; examples are given below.\n\nSuppose formula_3 has a normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance 1. Let formula_12 have the Rademacher distribution, so that formula_13 or formula_14, each with probability 1/2, and assume formula_12 is independent of formula_3. Let formula_17. Then \n\n\nTo see that formula_3 and formula_4 are uncorrelated, one may consider the covariance formula_24: by definition, it is\n\nThen by definition of the random variables formula_3, formula_4, and formula_12, and the independence of formula_12 from formula_3, one has\n\nTo see that formula_4 has the same normal distribution as formula_3, consider\n\n(since formula_3 and formula_36 both have the same normal distribution), where formula_37 is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution..\n\nTo see that formula_3 and formula_4 are not independent, observe that formula_40 or that formula_41.\n\nFinally, the distribution of the simple linear combination formula_42 concentrates positive probability at 0: formula_43. Therefore, the random variable formula_42 is not normally distributed, and so also formula_3 and formula_4 are not jointly normally distributed (by the definition above).\n\nSuppose formula_3 has a normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance 1. Let\n\nwhere formula_49 is a positive number to be specified below. If formula_49 is very small, then the correlation formula_51 is near formula_52 if formula_49 is very large, then formula_51 is near 1. Since the correlation is a continuous function of formula_49, the intermediate value theorem implies there is some particular value of formula_49 that makes the correlation 0. That value is approximately 1.54. In that case, formula_3 and formula_4 are uncorrelated, but they are clearly not independent, since formula_3 completely determines formula_4.\n\nTo see that formula_4 is normally distributed—indeed, that its distribution is the same as that of formula_3 —one may compute its cumulative distribution function:\n\nwhere the next-to-last equality follows from the symmetry of the distribution of formula_3 and the symmetry of the condition that formula_65.\n\nIn this example, the difference formula_66 is nowhere near being normally distributed, since it has a substantial probability (about 0.88) of it being equal to 0. By contrast, the normal distribution, being a continuous distribution, has no discrete part—that is, it does not concentrate more than zero probability at any single point. Consequently formula_3 and formula_4 are not \"jointly\" normally distributed, even though they are separately normally distributed.\n\nIt is well-known that the ratio formula_69 of two independent standard normal random deviates formula_70 and formula_71 has a Cauchy distribution. One can equally well start with the Cauchy random variable formula_69 and derive the conditional distribution of formula_71 to satisfy the requirement that formula_74 with formula_70 and formula_71 independent and standard normal. Cranking through the math one finds that\n\nin which formula_78 is a Rademacher random variable and formula_79 is a Chi-squared random variable with two degrees of freedom.\n\nConsider two sets of formula_80, formula_81. Note that formula_69 is not indexed by formula_83 – that is, the same Cauchy random variable formula_69 is used in the definition of both formula_85 and formula_86. This sharing of formula_69 results in dependences across indices: neither formula_88 nor formula_89 is independent of formula_90. Nevertheless all of the formula_70 and formula_71 are uncorrelated as the bivariate distributions all have reflection symmetry across the axes. \n\nThe figure shows scatterplots of samples drawn from the above distribution. This furnishes two examples of bivariate distributions that are uncorrelated and have normal marginal distributions but are not independent. The left panel shows the joint distribution of formula_88 and formula_90; the distribution has support everywhere but at the origin. The right panel shows the joint distribution of formula_89 and formula_90; the distribution has support everywhere except along the axes and has a discontinuity at the origin: the density diverges when the origin is approached along any straight path except along the axes.\n\n"}

It is divided into 100 cents.\n\nThe exchange rate of the Kenyan shilling slumped dramatically in mid-2011, from about 83 shillings per US dollar to about 100 shillings per US dollar at late 2011 and to 105 shillings in September 2015. The Central Bank of Kenya shifted its target to tighten liquidity, including increasing interest rate and money market operations. But expected inflows due to tea export drove up the exchange rate to about 84 shillings per US dollar on 31 January 2012.\n\nThe Kenyan shilling replaced the East African shilling in 1966 at par. \n\nThe first coins were issued in 1966 in denominations of 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents, and 1 and 2 shillings; 25-cent coins were not minted after 1969 (except in the 1973 set); 2-shilling coins were last minted in 1971 (except in the 1973 set). In 1973 and 1985, 5-shillings coins were introduced, followed by 10-shillings in 1994 and 20-shillings in 1998.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1978, the portrait of Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, originally appeared on the obverse of all of independent Kenya's coins. In 1980, a portrait of Daniel arap Moi replaced Kenyatta until 2005, when the central bank introduced a new coin series that restored the portrait of Kenyatta. The coins are 50 cents and 1 shilling in stainless steel and bi-metallic coins of 5, 10 and 20 shillings. \n\nA bi-metallic 40-shilling coin with the portrait of then-President Mwai Kibaki was issued in 2003 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of independence (1963–2003). New coins with the image of Kenyatta were issued in 2005. In 2010, Section 231(4) of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya stated \"Notes and coins issued by the Central Bank of Kenya may bear images that depict or symbolise Kenya or an aspect of Kenya but may not bear the portrait of any individual.\" New banknotes and coins are scheduled to be released by 2018 to meet up with this new law. A new series of coins was issued on 11th December 2018, in denominations of 1-, 5-, 10 and 20 shillings. All of the coins depict the national Coat of arms of Kenya on the obverse and images of Africa's recognizable animals on the reverse. The new series of coins is designed to be more recognizable for visually impaired people.\n\nOn 14 September 1966, the Kenyan shilling replaced the East African shilling at par, although the latter was not demonetised until 1969. The Central Bank of Kenya issued notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 shillings. All of the notes feature a portrait of Kenya's first prime minister and president, Jomo Kenyatta, on the front and diverse economic activities on the back.\n\n5 shillings notes were replaced by coins in 1985, with the same happening to 10 and 20 shillings in 1994 and 1998. In 1986, 200 shillings notes were introduced, followed by 500 shillings in 1988 and 1000 shillings in 1994.\n\nAs with the coins, Kenyatta appeared on the banknotes issued until 1978, with Daniel arap Moi's portrait replacing him in 1980. In 2003, after Mwai Kibaki replaced Moi as president, 5, 10, and 20 shillings notes from the 1978 series with Kenyatta's picture that had been in storage were issued, and circulated for a time. A new series of notes was then introduced on which Kenyatta reappeared in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 shillings. The issue of the 200 shillings banknote dated 12 December 2003 commemorates the \"40 years of Independence 1963–2003\". The banknotes are printed in Nairobi by security printer De La Rue.\n\nOn May 31, 2019, the Central Bank of Kenya issued a new family of banknotes without the portraits of known Kenyan individuals, as mandated by the Constitution of Kenya of 2010. At the same time, the Central Bank of Kenya has withdrawn all previous versions of the 1,000 shillings banknote. These remained legal tender until October 1, 2019. All of the banknotes for this series share a common design of the Kenyatta International Convention Centre on the front side of the notes, and the back side of the notes feature images showcasing the richness of the people and nature of Kenya: \"Green Energy\" (50 shillings), \"Agriculture\" (100 shillings), \"Social Services\" (200 shillings), \"Tourism\" (500 shillings) and \"Governance\" (1,000 shillings). All five denominations also embody each of the big five animals of Africa: the buffalo (50 shillings), the leopard (100 shillings), rhinoceros (200 shillings), the lion (500 shillings) and the elephant (1,000 shillings).\n\nThe Kenyan Shilling has been used since its inception without any symbolic graphic representation.\nIn 2013 a concept symbol was designed by a freelance artist. It gained quite a lot of positive with the Kenyan public praising the idea of finally having and owning their own signature symbol for the local currency, The Kenya Shilling, which has been in existence since 1966 when it replaced the East African Shilling.\n\nThe proposed sign or symbol uses the uppercase letter 'K' representing Kenya, and is combined with two parallel lines to represent the \"=\" symbol. Arithmetically, the equality sign is a function that shows balanced relationships between items of the same value - a relationship that forms the basis of money as a medium of exchange. This equivalence \"certifies\" the stability of the Shilling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1812232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812232", "title": "Comorian franc", "text": "Comorian franc\n\nThe franc (; ; sign: CF; ISO 4217 code: KMF) is the official currency of Comoros. It is nominally subdivided into 100 \"centimes\", although no centime denominations have ever been issued.\n\nThe French franc became the currency of Comoros after the islands became a French protectorate in 1886. In 1891, Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore (Ngazidja) issued coins denominated in centimes and francs which circulated alongside French currency. In 1912, the Comoros became a province of Madagascar, which was also a French possession. French banknotes and coins circulated in the colony. Apart from an emergency issue of small change notes in 1920, the French currency circulated alone until 1925.\n\nOn 1 July 1925, the French government formed an agreement with the \"Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas\" to create the \"Banque de Madagascar\", headquartered in Paris, and granted it a private monopoly to issue currency for the colony of Madagascar. The Malagasy franc (French: \"franc malgache\") was equivalent to the French franc and French coins continued to circulate as Madagascar had no coins of its own until 1943.\n\nWhen the Comoros became a separate French territory in 1945, the name of the issuing bank was changed to the \"Banque de Madagascar et des Comores\" (still headquartered in Paris). A branch office opened in Comoros in 1953. While the banknotes were changed to reflect the new status of Comoros, the coins were not changed and bore only the name Madagascar. On 26 December 1945, the Madagascar-Comores CFA franc was established and its value was fixed at 1.7 French francs. Old Madagascar coins and banknotes continued to circulate as this new currency. On 17 October 1948, the CFA franc was revalued to 2 French francs.\n\nIn 1950, the French government took over majority ownership of the Banque de Madagascar et des Comores. On 1 January 1960, the French franc was revalued, with 100 old francs becoming 1 new franc. (Décret n°59-1450 du 22 décembre 1959) The new exchange rate was 1 Madagascar-Comores CFA franc = 0.02 French francs (50 Madagascar-Comores CFA francs = 1 French franc).\n\nOn 26 June 1960, Madagascar gained independence from France, and the \"Institut d'Émission Malgache\" (headquartered in Antananarivo) was created to issue currency only for Madagascar. Madagascar left the CFA zone effective 1 July 1973.\n\nOn 23 November 1979, the government of Comoros signed the \"Accord de coopération monétaire entre la République Française et la République fédérale islamique des Comores\", a monetary cooperation agreement with France, making Comoros part of the franc zone (but not part of the CFA franc zone). This agreement provided for the establishment of a system of fixed parity between the French franc and the Comorian franc and free convertibility between the two currencies, guaranteed by the Comorian central bank's opening of an operations account (\"compte d'operation\") at the French Treasury (Trésor public) to handle all exchange transactions. Sixty-five percent of the foreign exchange reserves of Comoros are held in euros in this account. This account is similar to overnight deposits with the French Treasury: it may bear interest and may, in special circumstances, post a negative balance. However, to prevent this account from showing a lasting overdraft, a number of preventative measures have been set up.\n\nThe stability of the Comorian franc is founded on tight monetary and credit discipline, underpinned by two specific safeguard measures: the central bank is required to maintain 20% foreign-exchange cover of its sight liabilities, and the government is not allowed to draw more than 20% of the previous year's budget receipts from their central bank funds. The ministers of finance of the franc area (France, the CFA zone and Comoros) meet biannually. The agreement between France and the Comoros is essentially the same as the agreement France has with the CFA Zone. It is a continuation of a relationship of monetary cooperation between the two countries that has existed for more than a century.\n\nUntil 1994, the Comorian franc was pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 Comorian francs to 1 French franc. This was changed on January 12, 1994, when the currency was devalued in concert with the CFA franc devaluation. however, the Comorian franc was devalued 33⅓% to a new rate of 75 Comorian francs for 1 French franc, while the CFA franc's new rate was 100 CFA francs to 1 French franc. With the creation of the euro in January 1999, the Comorian franc was pegged, at its prevailing rate, to the new currency. The exchange rate is now 491.96775 Comorian francs to 1 euro.\n\nIn 1998 in anticipation of European Monetary Union, the Council of the European Union addressed the monetary agreements France has with the CFA Zone and Comoros and ruled that:\n\nThe statutes of the Central Bank of the Comoros (Banque Centrale des Comores / البنك المركزي القمري \"Al-Bank al-Markazi al-Qomori\") state that its board of directors shall have eight members who are chosen from the Comorian Government, the French Central Bank (Banque de France) and the French government. The post of Deputy Director of the Central Bank of the Comoros is held by a Banque de France official, who is responsible for monetary policy. Since 19 November 1999, all the central bank's official rates have been pegged to the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) leading to a stabilisation of interest rate differentials with the euro. The BCC applies a compulsory reserves system (30% of deposits) and a bank monitoring system. The headquarters are located in Moroni, and the current bank governor is Mer Said Ahmed Said Ali.\n\nIn 1890, Sultan Said Ali of Bambao, Ngazidja issued bronze 5 and 10 centimes and silver 5 francs. The coins were struck in Paris to the same specifications as the corresponding French coins. The three coins ceased to be valid in theory in 1912 but the lower two denominations were still turning up in general circulation as late as 1930. The two bronze coins are frequently used for magico-religious purposes. All three coins bore similar inscriptions, including the date 1308 AH, which corresponds to the Gregorian calendar years 1890/91 AD.\n\nIn the 1920s, a shortage of coins led to the issuance of private tokens by the principal colonial company on Ngazidja and a sugar plantation on Mayotte. Denominations included 25 and 50 centimes and 1 and 2 francs. Aluminium and bronze were used in these tokens.\nIn 1964, coins were introduced specifically for use in the Comoros, replacing the Madagascar coins previously in use. Aluminium 1, 2, and 5 franc and aluminium-bronze 10 and 20 franc coins were issued. In 1975, nickel 50 francs were introduced, followed by nickel 100 francs in 1977 and nickel 25 francs in 1981. Nickel-plated-steel replaced nickel after 1990. The Institut d'Émission des Comores issued coins between 1975 and 1977, whilst the Central Bank has issued coins since 1981.\n\nUntil 1975, only French appeared on Comorian coins. Since then, Comorian has also been used.\n\nGeneral circulation Comorian coins have always been minted by the Monnaie de Paris. This is indicated by the cornucopia mint mark on the coins, visible to the left of the date, although this was omitted from the 1994 50 franc piece at the request of the Comorian government. The coins are manufactured at their facility in Pessac, Gironde.\n\nThe 5-franc coin is nicknamed \"reali\", referring to the Spanish real; the 2-franc coin is nicknamed \"nusu\", meaning \"half\", and the 1-franc coin \"robo\", meaning \"quarter\". The 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-franc coins are rarely used because of their low value. The 25- and 100-franc coins contain the phrase \"Augmentons la production alimentaire\" (\"Let's increase food production\"). The 5-franc coin contains the phrase \"Conférence Mondiale sur les Pêches\" (\"World Conference on Fishing\"). Both of these phrases are references to programs by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Comoros is one of 114 countries that have issued FAO coins. More information on FAO coins can be found here.\n\nThe first Comorian paper money was issued in 1920. It consisted of an emergency issue of Madagascar postage stamps fixed to card to allow them to circulate as money. Denominations of 50 centimes and 1 franc were issued.\nLoi ordinaire 62-873 du 31 juillet 1962, Article 12, allowed the Banque de Madagascar et des Comores to continue issuing notes in Comoros after Madagascar began issuing its own currency but, beginning 1 April 1962, they had \"\" overstamped on them. Denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs were issued. As per Décret 64-1038 du 07 octobre 1964, banknotes without the overstamp ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 1964.\nThe overstamped notes circulated until 1976, when 500, 1000 and 5000 francs were introduced by the Institut d'Émission des Comores, the 50 and 100 franc notes being replaced by coins. The central Bank took over production of paper money in 1984. 2500 and 10,000 franc notes were introduced in 1997, followed by 2000 francs in 2005. The 2,500-franc note was demonetized on 31 January 2007.\n\nComorian banknotes are printed by the Banque de France at their paper mill in Vic-le-Comte and their printing works in Chamalières, both in Puy-de-Dôme, Auvergne. The 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 franc notes dated 2005 and 2006 contain the EURion constellation, along with other improved security features to make them more difficult to counterfeit.\n\nright You can see here all Comorian franc banknotes\n\n\n"}

Although the vast majority of New Testament scholars and historians of the ancient Near East agree that Jesus existed as a historical figure, most secular historians also agree that the gospels contain large quantities of ahistorical legendary details mixed in with historical information about Jesus's life. The Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke are heavily shaped by Jewish tradition, with the Gospel of Matthew deliberately portraying Jesus as a \"new Moses\". Although it is highly unlikely that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels directly based any of their stories on pagan mythology, it is possible that they may have subtly shaped their accounts of Jesus's healing miracles to resemble familiar Greek stories about miracles associated with Asclepius, the god of healing and medicine. The birth narratives of Matthew and Luke are usually seen by secular historians as legends designed to fulfill Jewish expectations about the Messiah.\n\nThe Gospel of John bears indirect influences from Platonism, via earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, and may also have been influenced in less obvious ways by the cult of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, though this possibility is still disputed. Later Christian traditions about Jesus were probably influenced by Greco-Roman religion and mythology. Much of Jesus's traditional iconography is apparently derived from Mediterranean deities such as Hermes, Asclepius, Serapis, and Zeus and his traditional birthdate on 25 December, which was not declared as such until the fifth century, was at one point named a holiday in honor of the Roman sun god Sol Invictus. At around the same time Christianity was expanding in the second and third centuries, the Mithraic Cult was also flourishing. Though the relationship between the two religions is still under dispute, Christian apologists at the time noted similarities between them, which some scholars have taken as evidence of borrowing, but which are more likely a result of shared cultural environment. More general comparisons have also been made between the stories about Jesus's birth and resurrection and stories of other divine or heroic figures from across the Mediterranean world, including supposed \"dying-and-rising gods\" such as Tammuz, Adonis, Attis, and Osiris, although the concept of \"dying-and-rising gods\" itself has received criticism.\n\nThe majority of New Testament scholars and historians of the ancient Near East agree that Jesus existed as a historical figure. While some scholars have criticized Jesus scholarship for religious bias and lack of methodological soundness, with very few exceptions such critics generally do support the historicity of Jesus and reject the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed. There is widespread disagreement among scholars about the accuracy of details of Jesus's life as it is described in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings, and the only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and that he was crucified under the orders of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. It is also generally, although not universally, accepted that Jesus was a Galilean Jew who called disciples and whose activities were confined to Galilee and Judea, that he had a controversy in the Temple, and that, after his crucifixion, his ministry was continued by a group of his disciples, several of whom were persecuted.\n\nNonetheless, most secular scholars generally agree that the gospels contain large amounts of material that is not historically accurate and is better categorized as legend. In a discussion of genuinely legendary episodes from the gospels, New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman mentions the birth narratives in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke and the release of Barabbas. He points out, however, that, just because these stories are not true does not mean that Jesus himself did not exist. According to theologians Paul R. Eddy and Gregory A. Boyd, there is no evidence that the portrayal of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (the three earliest gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke) was directly influenced by pagan mythology in any significant way. The earliest followers of Jesus were devout Palestinian Jews who abhorred paganism and would have therefore been extremely unlikely to model stories about their founder on pagan myths.\n\nDespite this, several scholars have noticed that some of the healing miracles of Jesus recorded in the Synoptic Gospels bear similarities to Greek stories of miracles associated with Asclepius, the god of healing and medicine. Brennan R. Hill states that Jesus's miracles are, for the most part, clearly told in the context of the Jewish belief in the healing power of Yahweh, but notes that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels may have subtly borrowed from Greek literary models. He states that Jesus's healing miracles chiefly differ from those of Asclepius by the fact that Jesus's are attributed to a human being on earth; whereas Asclepius's miracles are performed by a distant god. According to classical historians Emma J. Edelstein and Ludwig Edelstein, the most obvious difference between Jesus and Asclepius is that Jesus extended his healing to \"sinners and publicans\"; whereas Asclepius, as a god, refused to heal those who were ritually impure and confined his healing solely to those who thought pure thoughts. Scholars disagree whether the parable of the rich man and Lazarus recorded in originates with Jesus or if it is a later Christian invention, but the story bears strong resemblances to various folktales told throughout the Near East.\n\nIt is, however, widely agreed that the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels is deeply influenced by Jewish tradition. According to E. P. Sanders, a leading scholar on the historical Jesus, the Synoptic Gospels contain many episodes in which Jesus's described actions clearly emulate those of the prophets in the Hebrew Bible. Sanders states that, in some of these cases, it is impossible to know for certain whether these parallels originate from the historical Jesus himself having deliberately imitated the Hebrew prophets, or from later Christians inventing mythological stories in order to portray Jesus as one of them, but, in many other instances, the parallels are clearly the work of the gospel-writers. The author of the Gospel of Matthew in particular intentionally seeks to portray Jesus as a \"new Moses\". Matthew's account of Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus, Jesus's family's flight into Egypt, and their subsequent return to Judaea is a mythical narrative based on the account of the Exodus in the Torah. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus delivers his first public sermon on a mountain in imitation of the giving of the Law of Moses atop Mount Sinai. According to New Testament scholars Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, the teachings preserved in the sermon are statements that Jesus himself really said on different occasions that were originally recorded without context, but the author of the Gospel of Matthew compiled them into an organized lecture and invented context for them in order to fit his portrayal of Jesus as a \"new Moses\".\n\nAccording to Sanders, the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke are the clearest examples of legends in the Synoptic Gospels. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth, but they present two completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. The accounts of the Annunciation of Jesus's conception found in and are both modeled on the stories of the annunciations of Ishmael, Isaac, and Samson in the Old Testament. Matthew quotes from the Septuagint translation of to support his account of the virgin birth of Jesus. The Hebrew text of this verse states \"Behold, the young woman [\"ha‘almāh\"] is with child and about to bear a son and she will call him Immanuel.\" The Septuagint, however, translates the Hebrew word \"‘almāh\", which literally means \"young woman\", as the Greek word παρθένος (\"parthenos\"), which means \"virgin\". Most secular historians therefore generally see the two separate accounts of the virgin birth from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as independent legendary inventions designed to fulfill the mistranslated passage from Isaiah. Sanders clarifies that the birth narratives are \"an extreme case\" resulting from the authors of the gospels lack of knowledge about Jesus's birth and childhood; no other part of the gospels relies so heavily on Old Testament parallels. Sanders also notes that, despite the clearly intentional parallels, the \"striking differences\" between Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament are also highly significant and the gospels' accounts of Jesus's life on the whole do not closely resemble the lives of any of the figures in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAlthough Jesus's crucifixion is one of the few events in his life that virtually all scholars of all different backgrounds agree really happened, historians of religion have also compared it to Greek and Roman stories in order to gain a better understanding of how non-Christians would have perceived stories of Jesus's crucifixion. The German historian of religion Martin Hengel notes that the Hellenized Syrian satirist Lucian of Samosata (\"the Voltaire of antiquity\"), in his comic dialogue \"Prometheus\", written in the second century AD (about two hundred years after Jesus), describes the god Prometheus being fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus Mountains using all the terminology of a Roman crucifixion: he is nailed through the hands in such a manner as to produce \"a most serviceable cross\" (\"ἐπικαιρότατος... ὁ σταυρος\"). The gods Hermes and Hephaestus, who perform the binding, are shown as slaves whose brutal master Zeus threatens with the same punishment if they weaken. Unlike the crucifixion of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels, Lucian's crucifixion of Prometheus is a deliberate, angry mockery of the gods, intended to show Zeus as a cruel and capricious tyrant undeserving of praise or adoration. This is the only instance from all of classical literature in which a god is apparently crucified and the fact that the Greeks and Romans could only conceive of a god being crucified as a form of \"malicious parody\" demonstrates the kind of horror with which they would have regarded Christian stories of Jesus's crucifixion.\n\nAmerican theologian Dennis R. MacDonald has argued that the Gospel of Mark is, in fact, a Jewish retelling of the \"Odyssey\", with its ending derived from the \"Iliad\", that uses Jesus as its central character in the place of Odysseus. According to MacDonald, the gospels are primarily intended to show Jesus as superior to Greek heroes and, although Jesus himself was a real historical figure, the gospels should be read as works of historical fiction centered on a real protagonist, not as accurate accounts of Jesus's life. MacDonald's thesis that the gospels are modeled on the Homeric Epics has been met with intense skepticism in scholarly circles due to its almost complete reliance on extremely vague and subjective parallels. Other scholars state that his argument is also undermined by the fact that the Gospel of Mark never directly quotes from either of the Homeric Epics and uses completely dissimilar language. Pheme Perkins also notes that many of the incidents in the Gospel of Mark that MacDonald claims are derived from the \"Odyssey\" have much closer parallels in the Old Testament. MacDonald's argument, in a misunderstood form, has nonetheless become popular in non-scholarly circles, mostly on the internet, where it is used to support the Christ Myth theory. MacDonald himself rejects this interpretation as too drastic.\n\nThe Gospel of John, the latest of the four canonical gospels, possesses ideas that originated in Platonism and Greek philosophy, where the \"Logos\" described in John's prologue was devised by the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus and adapted to Judaism by the Jewish Middle Platonist Philo of Alexandria. However, the author of the Gospel of John was not personally familiar with any Greek philosophy and probably did not borrow the Logos theology from Platonic texts directly; instead, this philosophy probably influenced earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, which John inherited and expanded his own Logos theology from. In Platonic terminology, Logos was a universal force that represented the rationality and intelligibility of the world. On the other hand, as adapted into Judaism, Logos becomes a mediating divine figure between God and man and mostly owed influence from Wisdom literature and biblical traditions, and by the time it was transmitted into Judaism, seems to have only retained the concept of the universality of the Platonic logos. Davies and Finkelstein write \"This primeval and universal Wisdom had, at God's command, found itself a home on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. This mediatorial figure, which in its universality can be compared with the Platonic 'world-soul' or the Stoic 'logos', is here exclusively connected with Israel, God's chosen people, and with his sanctuary.\"\n\nScholars have long suspected that the Gospel of John may have also been influenced by symbolism associated with the cult of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. The issue of whether the Gospel of John was truly influenced by the cult of Dionysus is hotly disputed, with reputable scholars passionately defending both sides of the argument. Dionysus was one of the best-known Greek deities; he was worshipped throughout most of the Greco-Roman world and his cult is attested in Palestine, Asia Minor, and Italy. At the same time, other scholars have argued that it is highly implausible that the devout Christian author of the Gospel of John would have deliberately incorporated Dionysian imagery into his account and instead argue that the symbolism of wine in the Gospel of John is much more likely to be based on the many references to wine found throughout the Old Testament. In response to this objection, proponents of Dionysian influence have argued that it is possible that the author of the Gospel of John may have used Dionysian imagery in effort to show Jesus as \"superior\" to Dionysus.\n\nThe first instance of possible Dionysian influence is Jesus's miracle of turning water into wine at the Marriage at Cana in . The story bears some resemblance to a number of stories that were told about Dionysus. Dionysus's close associations with wine are attested as early as the writings of Plato and the second-century AD Greek geographer Pausanias describes a ritual in which Dionysus was said to fill empty barrels that had been left locked inside a temple overnight with wine. In the Greek novel \"Leucippe and Clitophon\" by Achilles Tatius, written in the first or second century AD, a herdsman takes Dionysus into his home and offers him a meal, but can only offer him the same thing to drink as his oxen. Miraculously, Dionysus turns the drink into wine. The account of turning water into wine does not occur in any of the Synoptic Gospels and is only found in the Gospel of John, indicating that the author of the fourth gospel may have invented it. A second occurrence of possible Dionysian influence is the allegory found in , in which Jesus declares himself to be the \"True Vine\", a title reminiscent of Dionysus, who was said to have discovered the first grape vine.\n\nMark W. G. Stibbe has argued that the Gospel of John also contains parallels with \"The Bacchae\", a tragedy written by the Athenian playwright Euripides that was first performed in 405 BC and involves Dionysus as a central character. In both works, the central figure is portrayed as an incarnate deity who arrives in a country where he should be known and worshipped, but, because he is disguised as a mortal, the deity is not recognized and is instead persecuted by the ruling party. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is portrayed as elusive, intentionally making ambiguous statements to evade capture, much like Dionysus in Euripides's \"Bacchae\". In both works, the deity is supported by a group of female followers. Both works end with the violent death of one of the central figures; in John's gospel it is Jesus himself, but in \"The Bacchae\" it is Dionysus's cousin and adversary Pentheus, the king of Thebes.\n\nStibbe emphasizes that two accounts are also radically different, but states that they share similar themes. One of the most obvious differences is that, in \"The Bacchae\", Dionysus has come to advocate a philosophy of wine and hedonism; whereas Jesus in the Gospel of John has come to offer his followers salvation from sin. Euripides portrays Dionysus as aggressive and violent; whereas the Gospel of John shows Jesus as peaceful and full of mercy. Furthermore, \"The Bacchae\" is set within an explicitly polytheistic world, but the Gospel of John admits the existence of only two gods: Jesus himself and his Father in Heaven.\n\nThe Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a short apocryphal gospel, probably written in the second century AD, describing Jesus's childhood. It is unique as the only purported account of Jesus's childhood to survive from early Christian times. It describes a variety of miracles attributed to the young Jesus. It remained continuously in popular use throughout the Middle Ages up until the time of the Reformation. Reidar Aasgaard has argued that the Infancy Gospel may have been partially intended for children and discusses how the stories in the gospel fit the genre of Greco-Roman fairy tales. J. R. C. Cousland argues that the Infancy Gospel may have been originally written for a primarily pagan audience, noting that the Greeks and Romans told stories about their gods' miraculous doings as children and that miracle stories were often instrumental in converting pagans to Christianity.\n\nAround the same time that Christianity was expanding, the cult of the god Mithras was also spreading throughout the Roman Empire. Very little is known for certain about the Mithraic cult because it was a \"Mystery Cult\", meaning its members were forbidden from disclosing what the cult believed to outsiders. No Mithraic sacred texts have survived, if any such writings ever existed. Consequently, it is disputed how much influence Christianity and Mithraism may have had on each other. Michael Patella states that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism are more likely a result of their shared cultural environment rather than direct borrowing from one to the other. Christianity and Mithraism were both of Oriental origin and their practices and respective savior figures were both shaped by the social conditions in the Roman Empire during the time period.\n\nMost of what is known about the legendary life of Mithras comes from archaeological excavation of Mithraea, underground Mithraic sanctuaries of worship, which were found all across the Roman world. Like Jesus, Mithras was seen as a divine savior, but, unlike Jesus, Mithras was not believed to have brought his salvation by suffering and dying. Mithras was believed to have been born fully-grown from a rock, a belief which is confirmed by a vast number of surviving sculptures showing him rising from the rock nude except for a Phrygian cap, clutching a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left. In many depictions, the rock is also encircled by a snake. In Mithraic cults primarily from the Rhine-Danube region, there are also representations of a myth in which Mithras shoots an arrow at a rock face, causing water to gush forth. This myth is one of the closest parallels between Mithras and Jesus. Both Christians and Mithraists used water as a symbol for their respective saviors. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the \"water of life\" and a votive altar to Mithras from Poetovio proclaims him as the \"fons perennis\" (\"the ever-flowing stream\").\n\nIn the center of every Mithraeum was a \"tauroctony\", a painting or sculpture showing Mithras as a young man, usually wearing a cape and Phrygian cap, plunging a knife into the neck or shoulder of a bull as he turns its head towards him, simultaneously turning his own head away. A dog laps up the blood pouring from the bull's wound, from which emerges an ear of corn, as a scorpion stings the bull's scrotum. Human torchbearers stand on either side of the scene, one holding his torch upright and other upside-down. A serpent is also present. The exact interpretation of this scene is unclear, but the image certainly depicts a narrative central to Mithraism and the figures in it appear to correspond to the signs of the zodiac. The closest parallel between Jesus and Mithras is the use of a ritual meal. After slaying the bull, Mithras was believed to have shared the bull's meat with the sun-god Sol Invictus, a meal which is shown in Mithraic iconography and which was ritually reenacted by Mithraists as part of their liturgy. Manfred Clauss, a scholar of the Mithraic cult, speculates that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism may have made it easier for members of the Mithraic cult to convert to Christianity without having to give up their ritual meal, sun-imagery, candles, incense, or bells, a trend which might explain why, as late as the sixth century, the Christian Church was still trying to stamp out the \"stulti homines\" who still paid obeisance to the sun every morning on the steps of the church itself.\n\nA few Christian apologists from the second and third centuries, who had never been members of the Mithraic cult and had never spoken to its members, claimed that the practices of the Mithraic cult were copied off Christianity. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr writes in his \"First Apology\", after describing the Christian Eucharist, that \"...the wicked devils have imitated [this] in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn.\" The later apologist Tertullian writes in his \"De praescriptione haereticorum\":\n\nThe devil (is the inspirer of the heretics) whose work it is to pervert the truth, who with idolatrous mysteries endeavours to imitate the realities of the divine sacraments. Some he himself sprinkles as though in token of faith and loyalty; he promises forgiveness of sins through baptism; and if my memory does not fail me marks his own soldiers with the sign of Mithra on their foreheads, commemorates an offering of bread, introduces a mock resurrection, and with the sword opens the way to the crown. Moreover has he not forbidden a second marriage to the supreme priest? He maintains also his virgins and his celibates.\n\nAccording to Ehrman, these writers were ideologically motivated to portray Christianity and Mithraism as similar because they wanted to persuade pagan officials that Christianity was not so different from other religious traditions, so that these officials would realize that there was no reason to single Christians out for persecution. These apologists therefore intentionally exaggerated similarities between Christianity and Mithraism to support their arguments. Scholars are generally wary of trusting anything these sources have to say about the Mithraic cult's alleged practices.\n\nIn late antiquity, early Christians frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit Christian purposes. This does not in any way indicate that Christianity itself was derived from paganism, only that early Christians made use of the pre-existing symbols that were readily available in their society. Sometimes Christians deliberately used pagan iconography in conscious effort to show Jesus as superior to the pagan gods. In classical iconography, the god Hermes was sometimes shown as a \"kriophoros\", a handsome, beardless youth bearing a ram or sheep over his shoulders. In late antiquity, this image developed a generic association with philanthropy. Early Christians adapted images of this kind as representations of Jesus in his role of as the \"Good Shepherd\".\n\nEarly Christians also identified Jesus with the Greek hero Orpheus, who was said to have tamed wild beasts with the music of his lyre. The Church Father Clement of Alexandria writes that Orpheus and Jesus are similar in that they have both been subject to admiration on account of their \"songs\", but insists that Orpheus misused his gift of eloquence by persuading people to worship idols and \"tie themselves to temporal things\"; whereas Jesus, the singer of the \"New Song\" brings peace to men and frees them from the bonds of the flesh. The later Christian historian Eusebius, drawing on Clement, also compares Orpheus to Jesus for having both brought peace to men. One unusual possible instance of identification between Jesus and Orpheus is a hematite gem inscribed with the image of a crucified man identified as ΟΡΦΕΩΣ ΒΑΚΧΙΚΟΣ (\"Orpheos Bacchikos\"). The gem has long been suspected to be a forgery created in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, but, if authentic, it may date to the late second or early third century AD. If authentic, the gem would represent a remarkable instance of pagans adopting Christian iconography, rather than \"vice versa\" as is generally more common. The gem was formerly housed at the Altes Museum in Berlin, but was lost or destroyed during World War II.\n\nEarly Christians found it hard to criticize Asclepius because, while their usual tactics were to denounce the absurdity of believing in gods who were merely personifications of nature and to accuse pagan gods of being immoral, neither of these could be applied to Asclepius, who was never portrayed as a personification of nature and whose stories were inscrutably moral. The early Christian apologist Justin Martyr argued that believing in Jesus's divinity should not be hard for pagans, since it was no different from believing in the divinity of Asclepius. Eventually, Christians adapted much of the iconography of Asclepius to suit the miracles of Jesus. Images of Jesus as a healer replaced images of Asclepius and Hippocrates as the ideal physician. Jesus, who was originally shown as clean-shaven, may have first been shown as bearded as a result of this syncretism with Asclepius, as well as other bearded deities such as Zeus and Serapis. A second-century AD head of Asclepius was discovered underneath a fourth-century AD Christian church in Gerasa, Jordan.\n\nIn some depictions from late antiquity, Jesus was shown with the halo of the sun god Sol Invictus. Images of \"Christ in Majesty\" seated upon a throne were inspired by classical depictions of Zeus and other chief deities. By the fourth century AD, the recognizable image of Jesus as long-haired, bearded, and clad in long, baggy-sleeved clothing had fully emerged. This widespread adaptation of pagan iconography to suit Jesus did not sit well with many Christians. A fragment of a lost work by Theodor Lector preserves a miracle story dated to around 465 AD in which the bishop Gennadius of Constantinople was said to have healed an artist who had lost all strength in his hand after painting an image of Christ showing him with long, curly hair, parted in the same manner as traditional representations of Zeus.\n\nChristians also may have adapted the iconography of the Egyptian goddess Isis nursing her son Horus and applied it to the Virgin Mary nursing her son Jesus. Some Christians also may have conflated stories about the Egyptian god Osiris with the resurrection of Jesus. The title of \"kosmokrateros\" (\"Ruler of the Cosmos\"), which was eventually applied to Jesus, had previously been borne by Serapis. The Church Father Jerome records in a letter dated to the year 395 AD that \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" This same cave later became the site of the Church of the Nativity. The church historian Eusebius, however, does not mention pagans having ever worshipped in the cave, nor do any other early Christian writers. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this argument by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz. During the sixth century AD, some Christians in the Middle East borrowed elements from poems of Tammuz's wife Ishtar mourning over her husband's death into their own retellings of the Virgin Mary mourning over the death of her son Jesus. The Syrian writers Jacob of Serugh and Romanos the Melodist both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for her son at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar's laments over the death of Tammuz.\n\nThe Bible never states when Jesus was born, but, by late antiquity, Christians had begun celebrating his birth on 25 December. In 274 AD, the Roman emperor Aurelian had declared 25 December the birthdate of Sol Invictus, a sun god of Syrian origin whose cult had been vigorously promoted by the earlier emperor Elagabalus. Christians may have thought that they could attract more converts to Christianity by allowing them to continue to celebrate on the same day. 25 December also falls around the same time as the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was much older and more widely celebrated. Many of the customs originally associated with Saturnalia eventually became associated with Christmas. Early Christians may have also been influenced by the idea that Jesus had died on the anniversary of his conception; because Jesus died during Passover and, in the third century AD, Passover was celebrated on 25 March, they may have assumed that Jesus's birthday must have come nine months later, on 25 December.\n\nAspects of Jesus's life as recorded in the gospels bear some similarities to various other figures, both historical and mythological. Proponents of the Christ Myth theory frequently exaggerate these similarities as part of their efforts to claim that Jesus never existed as a historical figure. Maurice Casey, the late Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the University of Nottingham, writes that these parallels do not in any way indicate that Jesus was invented based on pagan \"divine men\", but rather that he was simply not as perfectly unique as many evangelical Christians frequently claim he was.\n\nClassical mythology is filled with stories of miraculous births of various kinds, but, in most cases of divine offspring from classical mythology, the father is a god who engages in literal sexual intercourse with the mother, a mortal woman, causing her to give birth to a son who is literally half god and half man. A possible pagan precursor to the Christian story of the virgin birth of Jesus is an Athenian legend recounted by the mythographer Pseudo-Apollodorus. According to this account, Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths, once attempted to rape Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, but she pushed him away, causing him to ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her to give birth to Erichthonius, whom Athena adopted as her own child. Thus, Athena was able to produce a \"son\" without her losing her virginity. The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.\n\nAnother comparable story from Greek mythology describes the conception of the hero Perseus. According to the myth, Zeus came to Perseus's mother Danaë in the form of a shower of gold and impregnated her. Although no surviving Greek text ever describes this as a \"virgin birth\", the early Christian apologist Justin Martyr has his Jewish speaker Trypho refer to it as such in his \"Dialogue with Trypho\". Scholars have also compared the story of the virgin birth to the complex narratives revolving around the birth of Dionysus. In most versions of the conception of Dionysus, Zeus was said to have come to the mortal woman Semele disguised as a mortal and had sex with her. Zeus's wife Hera disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded her to ask Zeus to show her his true, divine form. Zeus eventually agreed, but, upon revealing his divine form, Semele was instantly incinerated by his lightning. Zeus rescued the unborn infant Dionysus and sewed him inside his own thigh, giving birth to him himself when it was time. In an alternative version of the story told by the Roman mythographer Hyginus, Dionysus was actually the son of Zeus and Persephone, who was torn apart by the Titans. Zeus rescued Dionysus's heart, ground it up, and mixed it into a potion, which he gave to Semele to drink, causing her to become pregnant with the infant who had been killed.\n\nAccording to M. David Litwa, the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke consciously attempt to avoid portraying Jesus's conception as anything resembling pagan accounts of divine parentage; the author of the Gospel of Luke tells a similar story about the conception of John the Baptist in effort to emphasize the Jewish character of Jesus's birth. Nonetheless, Litwe argues that the accounts are unconsciously influenced by pagan stories of divine men, despite their authors' efforts to avert this. Other stories of virgin births similar to Jesus's are referenced by later Christian writers. The third-century AD Christian theologian Origen retells a legend that Plato's mother Perictione had virginally conceived him after the god Apollo had appeared to her husband Ariston and told him not to consummate his marriage with his wife, a scene closely paralleling the account of the Annunciation to Joseph from the Gospel of Matthew. Origen interpreted this story and others like it as prefiguring the reality made manifest by Jesus's virginal conception. In the fourth century, the bishop Epiphanius of Salamis protested that, in Alexandria, at the temple of Kore-Persephone, the pagans enacted a \"hideous mockery\" of the Christian Epiphany in which they claimed that \"Today at this hour Kore, that is the virgin, has given birth to Aion.\"\n\nFolklorist Alan Dundes has argued that Jesus fits all but five of the twenty-two narrative patterns in the Rank-Raglan mythotype, and therefore more closely matches the archetype than many of the heroes traditionally cited to support it, such as Jason, Bellerophon, Pelops, Asclepius, Joseph, Elijah, and Siegfried. Dundes sees Jesus as a historical \"miracle-worker\" or \"religious teacher\", stories of whose life were told and retold through oral tradition so many times that they became legend. Dundes states that analyzing Jesus in the context of folklore helps explain some of the anomalies of the gospels, such as the fact that none of them give any information about Jesus’s childhood and adolescence, which Dundes explains by the fact that this is \"precisely the case for almost all heroes of tradition\". Other scholars have strongly criticized Dundes's application of the Rank-Raglan mythotype to Jesus, pointing out that Dundes draws the narrative patterns from different texts written centuries apart, without taking care to differentiate between them. Dundes's application has also been criticized due to the Rank-Raglan mythotype's artificial nature and its lack of specificity to Hellenistic culture. Nonetheless, Lawrence M. Wills states that the \"hero paradigm \"in some form\" does apply to the earliest lives of Jesus\", albeit not to the extreme extent that Dundes has argued.\n\nThe late nineteenth-century Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer wrote extensively about the existence of a \"dying-and rising god\" archetype in his monumental study of comparative religion \"The Golden Bough\" (the first edition of which was published in 1890) as well as in later works. Frazer's main intention was to prove that all religions were fundamentally the same and that all the essential features of Christianity could be found in earlier religions. Although Frazer himself did not explicitly claim that Jesus was a \"dying-and-rising god\" of the supposedly typical Near Eastern variety, he strongly implied it. Frazer's claims became widely influential in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century scholarship of religion, but are now mostly rejected by modern scholars.\n\nThe main examples of \"dying-and-rising gods\" discussed by Frazer were the Mesopotamian god Dumuzid/Tammuz, his Greek equivalent Adonis, the Phrygian god Attis, and the Egyptian god Osiris. Dumuzid/Tammuz was a god of Sumerian origin associated with vegetation and fertility who eventually came to be worshipped across the Near East. Dumuzid was associated with springtime agricultural fertility and, when the crops withered during the hot summer months, women would mourn over his death. Tammuz's categorization as a \"dying-and-rising god\" was based on the abbreviated Akkadian redaction of \"Inanna's Descent into the Underworld\", which was missing the ending. Since numerous lamentations over the death of Dumuzid had already been translated, scholars filled in the missing ending by assuming that the reason for Ishtar's descent was because she was going to resurrect Dumuzid and that the text could therefore be assumed to end with Tammuz's resurrection.\n\nThen, in the middle of the twentieth century, the complete, unabridged, original Sumerian text of \"Inanna's Descent\" was finally translated, revealing that, instead of ending with Dumuzid's resurrection as had long been assumed, the text actually ended with Dumuzid's \"death\". The discovery of the \"Return of Dumuzid\" in 1963 briefly revived hopes that Dumuzid might once again be able to be categorized as a \"dying-and-rising god\", but the text ultimately proved disappointing in this regard because it does not describe a triumph over death (as would be necessary for a true Frazerian \"resurrection myth\") and instead does precisely the opposite and affirms the \"inalterable power of the realm of the dead\" by the fact that Dumuzid can only leave the Underworld when his sister takes his place.\n\nFrazer and others also saw Tammuz's Greek equivalent Adonis as a \"dying-and-rising god\", despite the fact that he is never described as rising from the dead in any extant Greco-Roman writings and the only possible allusions to his supposed resurrection come from late, highly ambiguous statements made by Christian authors. Attis is never described as being resurrected either; although many myths surround his death, none of them ever claim that he was resurrected. Osiris was never truly resurrected either; in Egyptian myth, Osiris's brother Set was said to have murdered him, chopped his body into pieces, and scattered them across the land. Osiris's devoted wife Isis collected his dismembered limbs and reassembled them, allowing her to revive Osiris in the Duat, the Egyptian afterlife, where he became the king of the dead.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, scholars began to severely criticize the designation of \"dying-and-rising god\" altogether. In 1987, Jonathan Z. Smith concluded in Mircea Eliade's \"Encyclopedia of Religion\" that \"The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to have been largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts.\" He further argued that the deities previously referred to as \"dying-and-rising\" would be better termed separately as \"dying gods\" and \"disappearing gods\", asserting that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who \"died\" did not return, and those who returned never truly \"died\". By the end of the twentieth century, most scholars had come to agree that the notion of a \"dying-and-rising god\" was an invention and that the term was not a useful scholarly designation.\n\n\n"}

During the conversion, the new currency was locally abbreviated as MTn, but has since largely returned to MT.\n\nOld meticais were redeemed by the Bank of Mozambique for a period of six years, until December 31, 2012.\n\nIn 1980, coins were introduced in denominations of 50 centavos, 1, , 5, 10 and 20 meticais. The 50 centavos, and 5 meticais were minted in aluminium, with the 1 metical in brass and the 10 and 20 meticais in cupro-nickel. In 1986, aluminium 1, 10, 20 and 50 meticais were introduced. A new coinage issued in 1994 was composed of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 meticais, with the lower four denominations in brass clad steel and the higher denominations in nickel clad steel. 5000 meticais coins were introduced in 1998, followed by 10,000 meticais in 2003.\n\nFrom July 1, 2006, coins were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1, 2, 5, 10 meticais. \n\nThe First Metical had three issues of notes as follows:\ni. In 1980 (16 June 1980), notes were introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 meticais.\nii The same notes and denominations were reissued in 1983 (16 June 1983) with the new state logo, 5,000 meticais notes were introduced in 1989 (3 February 1989).\niii. In 1991 (16 June 1991) 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 notes were issued followed by 50,000 and 100,000 meticais in 1993 (16 June 1993), 20,000 meticais in 1999 (16 June 1999) and 200,000 and 500,000 meticais in 2003 (16 June 2003).\n\nFrom July 1, 2006, new banknotes were issued in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 meticais. On October 1, 2011, Banco de Moçambique has issued a new family of banknotes that are similar to the 2006 series, but with enhanced security features. The three smaller denominations are now printed on polymer while the higher denominations remain printed on paper. The higher denominated metical banknotes are printed by De La Rue.\n\n\n"}

It is based on the British play of the same name, written by Clemence Dane as a reaction to a law passed in Britain in the early 1920s that allowed insanity as grounds for a woman divorcing her husband. It was the second adaptation of the play, having previously been made into a British silent film \"A Bill of Divorcement\" in 1922. The film was remade again in 1940 by RKO Pictures.\n\n\"A Bill of Divorcement\" describes a day in the lives of a middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret \"Meg\" Fairfield (Billie Burke); her daughter Sydney (Hepburn); Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys (David Manners); Meg's fiancé Gray Meredith (Paul Cavanagh); and Meg's husband Hilary (John Barrymore), who escapes after spending almost twenty years in a mental hospital. After the family discusses Hilary's genetic predisposition toward psychiatric problems, which Sydney seems to have inherited, Hilary and Sydney give up Meg and Kit in order to avoid passing this trait to future generations.\n\nThe film begins on Christmas Eve as Meg gives a party in her comfortable English manor. In addition to dancing and listening to Christmas carols, Sydney and Kit happily discuss their future together, as do Meg and Gray. The only unpleasant moment of the evening occurs when the singers dedicate their performance of \"God Bless the Master of This House\" to Gray. Hilary's sister Hester (Elizabeth Patterson) objects to this because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized.\n\nOn Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to say that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in their family. The family's official explanation of Hilary's troubles has been that he experienced shell shock while fighting in World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past.\n\nHester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney sits down at the piano to play an unfinished sonata that Hilary wrote before going to war. A few minutes later, Hilary returns home, having escaped from the asylum. He meets Sydney and they chat comfortably, except for a heated argument that serves to further display their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited individuals.\n\nWhen Meg returns from church, she reacts to Hilary's presence with shock. She has not loved him for years, is frightened by him, and has been counting on her upcoming marriage to Gray, who helped her obtain a divorce on account of Hilary's insanity. However, Hilary is caught up in his own sudden recovery and assumes that she will welcome him back. He fails to understand and accept that her life with him ended long ago until his family doctor (Henry Stephenson) arrives from the asylum and explains the situation to him, saying, \"Face it, man! One of you must suffer. Which is it to be? A healthy woman with her life before her, or a man whose children ought never to have been born?\" The doctor says this in Sydney's presence.\n\nThis prompts Sydney to begin contemplating her own plans with Kit. After the doctor tells Sydney that any children she has would be at risk of inheriting Hilary's problems, she breaks her engagement to Kit and sends him away. Meanwhile, Hilary vacillates between accepting Meg's love for Gray and pleading with her to change her mind. Meg gives in to his pressure, but he spies her talking with Gray and sees how much she loves Gray and how miserable she feels.\n\nFinally, Hilary regains his will to do what is best, and he has Sydney send Meg and Gray away. When Sydney returns to Hilary, she tearfully embraces him and they agree that they will live together. The film ends as they sit together at the piano, cheerfully experimenting with new endings to his sonata.\n\n\nThe film was produced by David O. Selznick and George Cukor, who had disagreed about casting Hepburn. Cukor had seen Hepburn's screen test and was impressed by the 24-year-old, but Selznick did not like the way she looked and was afraid she would not be well received by audiences. Cukor cast her anyway (beginning what would be a lifelong professional and personal relationship between the two), and Hepburn was declared \"a new star on the cinema horizon\" by \"The Hollywood Reporter\".\n\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"An intelligent, restrained and often stirring picture has been produced from Clemence Dane's play \"A Bill of Divorcement.\" He added, \"Miss Hepburn's characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen and the producers have been wise in not minimizing the importance of her part because Mr. Barrymore is the star of the film.\"\n\nAccording to RKO records the film earned a profit of $110,000 during its first year of release, after cinema circuits deducted their exhibition percentage of box office ticket sales.\n\nKino Lorber released the DVD and Blu Ray editions of this film in July, 2018.\n\n"}

Managed by the Crewe Heritage Trust, the museum is located between Crewe railway station and Crewe town centre; the site was the location of the 'Old Works' which was demolished in the early 1980s.\n\nEstablished in 1987 and renamed in 1992 as Crewe Railway Age by the owning registered charity, the museum returned to its original name of Crewe Heritage Centre in early 2008. The museum is located in the old London, Midland and Scottish Railway yard, which was once part of Crewe Works, between the junction to Chester and the West Coast Main Line. The site is operated by supporters of the Crewe Heritage Centre, and is open to the public every weekend between Easter and October. The museum is also open for selected days during December.\n\nThe centre has a series of exhibits, ranging from the only surviving APT-P train, miniature railways, three open signal boxes (Crewe Station A, Crewe North Junction and Exeter West) and a varied collection of standard gauge steam, diesel and electric locomotives, as well as occasional visiting locomotives. The Main Exhibition Hall features many artefacts and exhibits associated with Crewe, from its locomotive and carriage construction to its famous junction railway station. Brake Van rides are available to the public during special events.\n\nBuilt by British Rail (BR) the 1970s and 1980s, this Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train (APT) is the only surviving APT set. Numbered 370 003/006, it is open at all times with an occasional cafe run from the original buffet car (selected days only). The APT-P museum can be found inside one of the carriages, with photographs on display from the APT project. The set was tilted for the first time in preservation in 2013. In early 2018, an additional surviving APT powercar (M49006) arrived at the museum. It is displayed separately alongside the main set.\n\nConstructed in 1992, the Crewe Heritage Centre Miniature Railway is a 600 metre long 184mm (7.25 in) gauge ride, the railway takes visitors on a trip from ‘Crewe Old Works’ station to ‘Spider Bridge’ station and the optional return journey. The railway includes a mixture of Steam, Petrol and Battery Electric locomotives; rides on this attraction are included in the museum admission price.\n\nThe Heritage Centre is also home to a 1,000m2 Exhibition Hall, which doubles both as an event space and as the main museum building. It features displays and exhibits about the town of Crewe. During the 2018/19 closed season, the building underwent a light refurbishment; this included replacement of the original 1987 entrance doors and a full internal repaint.\n\n\n\nFormer Manchester Metrolink T68 tram 1023 on loan from the Heaton Park Tramway from 2020, the vehicle will stay until construction of a new depot at Heaton Park to cater for it.\n\nBoth mainline and miniature railways operate on most weekends. The standard gauge railway uses either the British Rail Class 03 03073, [British Rail Class 47] D1842, [47192] or ex-Direct Rail Services British Rail Class 47 47712. A cylinder and Caprotti valve gear from the locomotive, Duke of Gloucester, forms part of a permanent display. There may also be occasional visiting locomotives.\nThe Centre has its own Depot Code, CQ, but only 47712 and 87035 are classed as being locomotives of this depot.\n\nAcquired in early 2020 by a private owner and moved on site as a permanent exhibit. 86247's number 2 end cab resides in Europhoenix livery and will be restored to early 2000s condition externally with the refitting of marker, tail and head lights. Previously in its life it was a demonstrator loco for the Bulgarian/Hungary exports of the class, eventually it came into the hands of Freightliner for spares recovery after it was not exported. In 2015 it was cut up at Crewe Basford Hall with both cabs at the time going to the South Wales Loco Cab Preservation Group.\n\n\n"}
