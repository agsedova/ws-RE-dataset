Therefore, routing messages are smaller, and can therefore be sent more frequently. This means that nodes' routing tables are more up-to-date.\n\nTBRPF is controlled under a US patent filed in December 2000 and assigned to SRI International (Patent ID 6845091, issued January 18, 2005).\n\n\n"}

He was instrumental in establishing the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, serving as the orchestra's first artistic director and conductor from 1935–1941. He had a long and fruitful partnership with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City that began with his appointment as a rehearsal accompanist in 1917; ultimately working there as one of the company's conductors in mainly the French opera repertoire from 1929-1950. From 1951–1966 he was the principal conductor of the Orchestre Symphonique de Québec. He was also a featured conductor for a number of RCA Victor recordings, including an acclaimed reading of Gabriel Fauré's \"Requiem\" featuring baritone Mack Harrell and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and chorus.\n\nPelletier was one of the most influential music educators in Canada during the 20th century. It was largely through his efforts that the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec (CMADQ), an organization which has established and oversees nine different schools of higher education in music and theatre in Quebec, was established in 1942. From 1943 through 1961 he served as the director of the CMADQ and its first school the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. He also served as the first director of the CMDAQ's second school, the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Québec, from 1944–1946, and was instrumental in establishing the Conservatoire d'art dramatique du Québec à Montréal in 1954.\n\nAs a pianist, Pelletier was active during the 1920s and 1930s as one half of a piano duo with partner Arthur Loesser, the half-brother of Broadway composer Frank Loesser. The two made a number of recordings together that were made under the direction of Arthur Bodanzky. He also made a number of solo recordings and Ampico piano rolls in the early 1920s, playing mostly piano reductions from the operas of French composers like Georges Bizet, Charles Gounod, and Jules Massenet. As a composer, he produced only a small body of work, most notably \"In the Dark, in the Dew\" (published in Boston, 1923) which soprano Maria Jeritza included in a number of her recitals. He was married three times in his life, notably to opera singers Queena Mario and Rose Bampton.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Pelletier was the son of a baker who in his spare time performed actively as an amateur musician and conducted a community concert band. At the age of 8 he began to study music with Ida Héraly, the wife of clarinetist and bandmaster François Héraly, who taught him piano, music theory, and solfège up through 1914. His older brother Albert taught him to play percussion instruments and at the age of 12 he began playing the drums with the St-Pierre-Apôtre parish temperance band in concerts at a local movie theatre.\n\nIn 1910, at the age of 14, Pelletier had his first exposure to opera, a performance of Ambroise Thomas's \"Mignon\" at His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal. The performance absolutely enthralled him and he decided that night that he wanted to pursue a career conducting operas. While attempting to find work in the field of opera he took a position as the pianist for the orchestra of the National Theatre in Montreal. In the summer of 1911 he was hired by Henri Delcellier as the rehearsal pianist with the Montreal Opera Company (MOC), remaining there until the company went bankrupt in 1913. While working for the company he married his first wife Berthe Jeannotte, the sister of tenor Albert Clerk-Jeannotte.\n\nThe experience of losing his job with the MOC made Pelletier question his potential career opportunities in Canada and he decided that he needed to find a way to go to Europe. Lack of finances prevented him from pursuing this course of action, and he continued his studies in his native city with Alexis Contant (harmony and composition), Alfred La Liberté (piano), and Rodolphe Mathieu (piano). His teachers encouraged him to enter the Prix d'Europe competition which he lost in 1914 but won in 1915. This competition win led to the Quebec government giving him a grant to pursue studies in Europe.\n\nIn October 1916 Pelletier and his wife arrived in Paris, France in the midst of World War I and the outbreak of a major flu epidemic. Undaunted, the couple remained until circumstances related to the war forced them to leave at the end of June 1917. Although only in France for roughly nine months, Pelletier's time there was well spent under the tutelage of Isidor Philipp (piano), Marcel Samuel-Rousseau (harmony), Charles-Marie Widor (composition), and most importantly Camille Bellaigue who gave him singing lessons and worked with him in learning the French operatic repertoire on the piano.\n\nIn July 1917 the Pelletiers arrived in New York City where they were befriended by conductor Pierre Monteux who introduced them to important people in the musical social circles of the city. These connections led to his being hired at the Metropolitan Opera as a rehearsal pianist for the company's French opera productions, a position he maintained until 1922 when he was promoted to assistant conductor at the Met. Between 1917–1924 he also frequently played the piano for the Met's Sunday Night Concert Series, and he also portrayed the minor role of Boleslao Lazinski in Umberto Giordano's \"Fedora\" on the Met stage between 1924–1926. During these early years with the Met he developed a lasting friendship with Arturo Toscanini, who later hired him to conduct his NBC Symphony Orchestra on numerous occasions when he himself was unavailable. After divorcing his first wife (with whom he had two sons: Camille and François), he married Met soprano Queena Mario in 1925. That relationship also ended in divorce some years later. He later married a former voice student of Mario's, opera star Rose Bampton in 1937.\n\nFrom 1919–1922 Pelletier was the rehearsal pianist and assistant conductor for Antonio Scotti's touring company the Scotti Opera Company where he worked under conductors Gennaro Papi and Carlo Peroni. With this company he conducted his first complete opera performance, Giuseppe Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" on 21 May 1920 in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1922 he conducted operas for the Ravinia Park Opera Company of Chicago, the San Francisco Opera, and on 19 February of that year he conducted for the first time at the Met for one of the Sunday Concerts. On 4 April 1926 he conducted his first opera at the Met, Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", with Carmela Ponselle as Santuzza and Armand Tokatyan as Turiddu. That same year he was appointed Artistic Director of the Sunday Night Concert series.\n\nOn 28 February 1929 Pelletier was promoted by Giulio Gatti-Casazza from assistant to regular conductor at the Met, a position he maintained through 1950. His first performance in this title was conducting Deems Taylor's \"The King's Henchman\" on the following 29 March with Edward Johnson, Florence Easton, and Lawrence Tibbett starring. He went on to conduct the house premieres of Benjamin Godard's ballet \"Reminiscence\", Johann Strauss II's \"Die Fledermaus\", Domenico Cimarosa's \"Il matrimonio segreto\", and Igor Stravinsky's \"Apollo\". He was also the driving force behind establishing the 'Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air' competition (precursor to the Metropolitan National Council Auditions) in 1936. His final and 462nd performance at the Met was on 15 May 1950 conducting Charles Gounod's \"Faust\" with Giuseppe Di Stefano in the title role, Nadine Conner as Marguerite, Luben Vichey as Méphistophélès, and Robert Merrill as Valentin.\n\nDuring the 1940s Pelletier made several opera recordings at the request of the National Committee for Music Appreciation in New York with artists from the Metropolitan Opera. These gramophone records (78-rpm albums) were abridged versions of popular operas like \"Aida\", \"La Bohème\", \"Carmen\", \"Faust\", \"I Pagliacci\", \"Madama Butterfly\", \"Rigoletto\", and \"La traviata\" among others. The recordings were originally released by the World's Greatest Operas label, and many of them were later reissued by RCA Camden and Parade Records on LP. In 1938 he appeared on camera in Paramount's feature film \"The Big Broadcast of 1938\" as he conducted Norwegian soprano Kirsten Flagstad in Brunhilde's Battle Cry from Richard Wagner's \"Die Walküre\".\n\nWhile working at the Met in the early 1930s, Pelletier was approached by Canadian industrialist and philanthropist Jean Lallemand to collaborate with him and the Béique and David families of Montreal in establishing a new orchestra in his native city. He initially rejected the offer, still having a somewhat critical attitude towards the state of the arts in Canada. However, he was later persuaded by his father, who reminded him of the support of the Quebec government earlier in his life, to have pride in his country and do what he could in service to it. He accordingly returned to Montreal and began putting together what would eventually become the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO).\n\nThe MSO gave its first concert under the name Les Concerts Symphoniques in January 1935 at Plateau Hall. On 16 November 1935 the orchestra performed the first of many \"Matinées symphoniques pour la jeunesse\" (The Young People's concert) which had been Pelletier's brainchild. In 1936 he established the Montreal Festivals, which included a summer concert series by the MSO in addition to featuring other Canadian ensembles and musicians. The festival continued annually long after Pelletier's departure from the MSO in 1941. He notably returned to conduct the festival's last performance before it was disestablished at the Place des Arts in August 1965.\n\nPelletier was appointed the first director of the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec and its first school, the Conservatoire de musique de Montréal (CMQM), in 1943. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Canadian composer Claude Champagne had put together a large report on music education that was sponsored by the Quebec government. The report closely examined music education in Europe as well as in Canada and plans were soon formed to establish a network of state-subsidized school which would be modeled after European conservatories, particularly the Conservatoire de Paris. On 29 May 1942 The Conservatory Act ('Loi du conservatoire') was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec which allocated a $30,000 budget to form the conservatoire.\n\nPelletier and Champagne, who was appointed the conservatoire's assistant director, were largely responsible for recruiting a highly impressive international staff of teachers. The CMQM opened its doors in January 1943 with its first round of courses which were held at the Saint-Sulpice Library. Under their leadership, the school gained a high reputation for the quality of its education. In 1956 the two men oversaw the moving of the school to better facilities on Saint Catherine Street. Pelletier was succeeded in the role of director by Roland Leduc in 1961 after 18 years on the job. He also served as the first director of the CMDAQ's second school, the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Québec, from 1944 until 1946 when Henri Gagnon succeeded him.\n\nPelletier and his wife both decided to leave the Metropolitan Opera when Rudolf Bing was appointed the company's new general manager in 1950. Bampton stated in a 1989 interview that, \"Both of us got the feeling that we wouldn't be happy with the new regime.\" This change considerably freed up Pelletier's schedule and enabled him to accept at offer to become artistic director of the Orchestre Symphonique de Québec. He assumed the post in June 1951, remaining there for the next 15 years. During that time he also conducted the Children's Concerts of the New York Philharmonic from 1952–1957 and the tours of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada in 1960–1961.\n\nPelletier retired from performance in the early 1970s and thereafter lived with his wife in New York City. He died in Wayne, Pennsylvania in 1982. His memoirs, \"Une symphonie inachevée\", were published ten years prior to his death.\n\n\n\n"}

It was announced on April 27, 2005 along with N70 and N90 as the first three Nseries devices.. The N91 ran on Symbian-based S60 3rd Edition (the first to run on Symbian 9.1). It was the first ever phone encompassing a 4 GB internal hard drive, allowing storage for 3,000 songs (an 8 GB revision came later). The N91 is highly focused on music. with dedicated music keys on the front which slide down to reveal the keypad. It also featured the industry-standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, and was anticipated as a major challenger to Apple, whose iPod dominated the industry. The design of the N91 is based on stainless steel with a matte finish.\n\nThe N91 became one of 2005's most anticipated phones, however it suffered from a long delay of release. It was expected to begin shipping by the end of 2005; but in September that year the device was delayed till 2006. In February 2006, it was delayed yet again due to software issues, pushing the release to Q2. Finally in April 2006 it was first released to consumers, a full year after announcement.\n\nNevertheless, N91 won the 'Most Innovative Product' and 'Most Technologically Advanced Product' award in recognition of its true multimedia music experience, added together with its high-end smartphone capabilities. In advertisements for the phone, Nokia recommended Bose and Sennheiser headphones. Its sound output is considered by many to be of very high quality and very loud.\n\nIt features a 2-megapixel camera and a music player playing songs encoded in either AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, mp3PRO, WAV, MIDI, or Microsoft's WMA format. It is generally considered the benchmark in the music department, simply for its unparalleled sound quality through headphones. It also features 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity. The phone features a 176 x 208, 262,144 colours TFT LCD display and dedicated music functionality buttons (XpressMusic) that slide down to reveal traditional mobile phone keys. Battery life when solely playing music has been estimated at 12 hours.\n\nThe N91 was not the first smartphone with a gigabyte hard drive: the Samsung SGH-i300, announced just a month before the N91, was the first. However the N91 packed in 4 GB, compared to 3 GB for the i300.\n\nAn 8GB variant or N91 8GB, internally known as N91-2, was announced on September 26, 2006. This upgraded model features some minor improvements in addition to the extra storage space. The most prominent feature on the N91-2, apart from the increased memory, was the inclusion of A2DP Bluetooth Profile. This profile enabled wireless music playback over Bluetooth, in full stereo (2 different channels, L+R). Compatible Bluetooth headsets were already available in the market by then. N91 8GB had a distinct Black color, that added to its face value. Once again breaking a record: it was the first phone with an 8GB hard disk.\n\nN91-5 was a version of the N91 with the 4 GB memory, but without Wi-Fi (WLAN) and 3G Network support. It was produced by the Chinese plant of Nokia. This model retailed for about 50 Euros less than the regular N91.\n\n\nThe N91 has been praised with an impeccable reputation of the best sounding mobile phone ever produced. The audio reproduction is spot on and is comparable to high end music systems. Its 'Loudness' and 'Stereo widening' effects, when used together, provide astonishing tonal clarity and dynamic range. It is also considered to have the loudest audio output on a mobile phone. The phones that followed N91 suffered from lower sound output due to EU regulation laws, most notably N81 which is supposed to be a successor to N91.\n\nThe Nokia N91 uses a special Toshiba DAC-33 chip set and a powerful in-built Harman Kardon amplifier to boost up its volume while maintaining acoustics, resulting in louder, deep bass and rich sound with perfect low, mid range & a slightly damped high range frequency which has not been achieved by any iPod or Sony Walkmans.[8] The slight damping in the high frequency is a boon for music listeners as it won't strain the ears even after prolonged use. This is one of the few standard hand held devices which can drive high end & higher impedance headset's with considerable volume. Test conducted, the N91 wins over iPod Nano in its signal to noise ratio, output power at full volume, and output at 10–100 Hz.\n\nAlthough N91 was considered the benchmark during its time it has been surpassed by modern phones such as the LG V20 & LG V30 which feature dedicated Quad DAC and sound filters for higher audio quality through headphones.\n\nThere have been a few problems with the N91, namely connecting the phone to a Macintosh computer. This will often cause the phone to crash as the two units are disconnected and music files are often not recognised despite being loaded into the phone's hard drive. Also, in old firmware versions, when you install a new theme, it will reset itself back to the default theme. Users can update the firmware using Nokia's PC Suite.\n\nIn the Philippines, there was an incident involving an N91 being used with one of Nokia's 46 million recalled BL-5C lithium-ion batteries, and exploded as a result.\n\n\n"}

Levine is an American clinical psychologist, often at odds with the mainstream of his profession (see critical psychology), in private practice in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has been in practice for more than three decades. Levine writes and speaks widely on how society, culture, politics and psychology intersect (see Levine bio).\n\nLevine's most recent book is \"Resisting Illegitimate Authority: A Thinking Person’s Guide to Being an Anti- Authoritarian—Strategies, Tools, and Models\" (AK Press, 2018). Levine describes how the capacity to comply with abusive authority is humanity’s “fatal flaw,” but fortunately there are anti-authoritarians—people comfortable questioning the legitimacy of authority and resisting its illegitimate forms. However, as \"Resisting Illegitimate Authority\" reveals, these rebels are regularly scorned, shunned, financially punished, psychopathologized, criminalized, and even assassinated. Profiling a diverse group of US anti-authoritarians—from Thomas Paine to Harriet Tubman, Malcolm X, Lenny Bruce, and Noam Chomsky—in order to glean useful lessons from their lives, \"Resisting Illegitimate Authority\" provides political, spiritual, philosophical, and psychological tools to help those suffering violence and vilification in a society whose most ardent cheerleaders for “freedom” are often its most obedient and docile citizens. Discussing anti-authoritarian approaches to depression, relationships, and parenting, Levine makes it clear that far from being a disease, disobedience may be our last hope.\n\nHis previous book was \"Get Up, Stand Up: Uniting Populists, Energizing the Defeated, and Battling the Corporate Elite\" (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2011, ). It calls for a new kind of politics to help Americans overcome what Levine sees as political demoralization.\n\nPublished in 2007, \"Surviving America's Depression Epidemic: How to Find Morale, Energy, and Community in a World Gone Crazy\" (Chelsea Green Publishing) argues that by not seriously confronting posited societal sources of depression, American mental health institutions have become part of the problem rather than the solution. The book provides an alternate approach that encompasses what Levine describes as the whole of our humanity, society, and culture, and which redefines depression (as a problematic strategy to shut down pain) in a way that makes enduring transformation more likely.\n\nLevine is also the author of \"Commonsense Rebellion: Taking Back Your Life from Drugs, Shrinks, Corporations and a World Gone Crazy\" (New York-London: Continuum, 2003), a protest book. The 26 alphabetically ordered chapters of \"Commonsense Rebellion\" detail Levine's contention that the high national rates of mental illness in the United States are really just natural reactions (e.g., discontent and disconnectedness) to the oppression of what he terms an \"institutional society,\" which he argues causes many to break down psychologically. An earlier edition was released in 2001 with the subtitle \"Debunking Psychiatry, Confronting Society — An A to Z Guide to Rehumanizing Our Lives\".\n\nHis article \"Troubled children and teens: Commonsense solutions without psychiatric drugs and manipulations\" (published in the book \"Alternatives Beyond Psychiatry\" (edited by Peter Stastny & Peter Lehmann – Berlin / Eugene / Shrewsbury: Peter Lehmann Publishing 2007, [UK], [USA], ebook in 2018) was also translated into the German language and published in the same year with the title \"Gestörte Kinder und Teenager. Sinnvolle Lösungen ohne Psychopharmaka und sonstige Manipulationen\" in \"Statt Psychiatrie 2\" (edited by & Peter Stastny – Berlin / Eugene / Shrewsbury: Antipsychiatrieverlag, , ebook in 2018).\n\nLevine is a regular contributor to \"AlterNet\",\" \"CounterPunch,\" \"Z Magazine,\" \"Truthout,\" and \"The Huffington Post,\" and his articles have appeared in \"Adbusters,\" \"The Ecologist\" and many other publications.\n\nLevine is a member of MindFreedom International, a group opposed to what they describe as coercive mental health treatment, and on the Advisory Council of the International Society for Ethical Psychology and Psychiatry (ISEPP).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806500", "title": "John Lemprière", "text": "John Lemprière\n\nJohn Lemprière (c. 1765, Jersey – 1 February 1824, London) was an English classical scholar, lexicographer, theologian, teacher and headmaster. He was the son of Charles Lemprière (died 1801), of Mont au Prêtre, Jersey.\n\nHe received his early education at Winchester College, where his father sent him in 1779, and from 1785 at Pembroke College, Oxford, probably on the advice of Richard Valpy, graduating BA in 1790, MA in 1792, BD in 1801, and DD in 1803.\n\nLemprière may have been influenced by another Pembroke man, the lexicographer Dr Samuel Johnson, whose famous \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" had appeared in 1755. A little over thirty years later, around 1786, Lemprière started work on his own Classical dictionary.\n\nIn 1787, he was invited by Valpy to be assistant headmaster at Reading Grammar School, and in 1789, to the great pride of his father, he preached in St Helier, Jersey. He achieved renown for his \"Bibliotheca Classica\" or \"Classical Dictionary containing a full Account of all the Proper Names mentioned in Ancient Authors\", (Reading, November 1788), which, edited by various later scholars, long remained a readable if not absolutely trustworthy reference book in mythology and classical history. Lemprière wished \"to give the most accurate and satisfactory account of all the proper names which occur in reading the Classics, and by a judicious collection of anecdotes and historical facts to draw a picture of ancient times, not less instructive than entertaining.\" (Lemprière, Preface, 1788). It has been a handbook for teachers, journalists, dramatists and poets for almost two hundred years and John Keats is said to have known the book almost by heart. \"Far from being just an ordinary dictionary, however, Lemprière's encyclopedic work is full of incidental details and stories which bring the mythical past to life.\" It is also assumed that the great scholar Valpy helped Lemprière with the dictionary.\n\nLemprière held a schoolmaster's post at Bolton Grammar School in 1791 and was a curate at Radley. From 6 August 1792 until his resignation in midsummer 1809, he was headmaster of Abingdon Grammar School, and in 1800 was also appointed as vicar of that parish, serving until 1811. While occupying these two posts, he published a \"Universal Biography of Eminent Persons in all Ages and Countries\" (London, 1808).\n\nHe is said to have neglected at this time both his clerical as well as his scholarly duties, so that in 1799 he was deprived of his benefice but there seems to be no particular evidence that this is the case. However it is known that his relationship with the Corporation was extremely poor and their perception was that he was running the School against several of Roysse's Ordinances, which was considered damaging to the School and town. \n\nIn 1809 he succeeded to the headmastership of Exeter Free Grammar School and held this post until 1819. On retiring from this school, following a disagreement with the trustees, he received the living of Meeth in Devon, which, together with that of Newton St Petrock, he held until his death from a stroke in the Strand, London. \nHe is buried in Meeth, where his grave can be found.\n\nTwo of his sons were also Rectors of Meeth: Francis Drocus Lemprière (born 1794) and Everard Lemprière (born 1800). His daughter Caroline, who died at the age of twenty-seven, was the first wife of John Bathurst Deane.\n\n\n\nThe 1991 prize-winning novel \"Lemprière's Dictionary\" by Lawrence Norfolk has as its background Lemprière's writing of his dictionary, as well as the places the Lemprière family came from. The main character is John Lemprière, author of the \"Classical Dictionary\", and also his father, Charles Lemprière. The rest of the story is fiction.\n\nIt is possible that the poet Tony Harrison makes reference to Lemprière in his poem \"A Kumquat for John Keats\" in the line \"Flora asphyxiated by foul air / unknown to Keats or Lemprière\" – as he would have been a contemporary of John Keats.\n\nThe character Mr. Scogan expresses his admiration for Lemprière's work as a biographer and lexicographer in Aldous Huxley's novel \"Crome Yellow\" (ch. XIV).\n\nIn George Orwell's \"Keep The Aspidistra Flying\" there is \"\"You'll find it in Lempriere\"\" snark remark made by protagonist at Rosemary.\n\nIn Gilbert and Sullivan's first joint operetta \"Thespis\" there are several references to Lempriere when the cast are arguing about their rightful positions in ancient Greek mythology.\n\nIn Virginia Woolf's \"Between The Acts\", there is a reference to Lempriere to help find the origin of \"Touch wood.\"\n\n\n\n"}

STP occupies a site west of the Colorado River about southwest of Houston. It consists of two Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors and is cooled by a reservoir, which eliminates the need for cooling towers.\nOnly recently did the capacity of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 surpass either of these Texas units.\n\nOn December 6, 1971, Houston Lighting & Power Co. (HL&P), the City of Austin, the City of San Antonio, and the Central Power and Light Co. (CPL) initiated a feasibility study of constructing a jointly-owned nuclear plant. The initial cost estimate for the plant was $974 million (equivalent to approximately $ in 2015 United States Dollars).\n\nBy mid-1973, HL&P and CPL had chosen Bay City as the site for the project and San Antonio had signed on as a partner in the project. Brown and Root was selected as the architect and construction company. On November 17, 1973 voters in Austin narrowly approved their city's participation and the city signed onto the project on December 1. Austin held several more referendums through the years on whether to stay in the project or not.\n\nAn application for plant construction permits was submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in May 1974 and the NRC issued the permits on December 22, 1975. Construction started at December 22, 1975.\n\nBy 1978, the South Texas Project was two years behind schedule and had substantial cost overruns. A new management team had been put in place by HL&P in late 1978 to deal with the cost overruns, schedule delays and other challenges. However, events at Three Mile Island in March 1979 had a substantial impact on the nuclear industry including STNP. The new team again moved forward with developing a new budget and schedule. Brown and Root revised their completion schedule to June 1989 and the cost estimate to $4.4–$4.8 billion. HL&P executives consulted with its own project manager and concluded that Brown and Root was not making satisfactory progress and a decision was reached to terminate their role as architect/engineer but retain them as constructor. Brown and Root was relieved as architect/engineer in September 1981 and Bechtel Corporation contracted to replace them. Less than two months later, Brown and Root withdrew as the construction contractor and Ebasco Constructors was hired to replace them in February 1982 as constructor.\n\nAustin voters authorized the Quentin Camp Foundation on November 3, 1981 to sell the city's 16 percent interest in the STP. No buyers were found.\n\nUnit 1 reached initial criticality on March 8, 1988 and went into commercial operation on August 25. Unit 2 reached initial criticality on March 12, 1989 and went into commercial operation on June 19.\n\nIn February 1993, both units had to be taken offline to resolve issues with the steam-driven auxiliary feedwater pumps. They were not back in service until March (Unit 1) and May (Unit 2) of 1994.\nThe history of STNP is somewhat unusual when most nuclear plants that were in the early stages of engineering construction at the time of the Three Mile Island event were never completed. STNP operating team has been noted highly for its stellar operating history which must also be based upon a solid design and construction plan.\n\nOn June 19, 2006, NRG Energy filed a Letter Of Intent with the NRC to build two 1,358-MWe Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWRs) at the South Texas Nuclear Project site.\nSouth Texas Nuclear Project Partners CPS Energy and Austin Energy were not involved in the initial Letter of Intent and development plans.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, NRG Energy filed an application with the NRC to build two Toshiba ABWRs at the South Texas Nuclear Project site.\nIt was the first application for a nuclear reactor submitted to the NRC since 1979. The proposed expansion would generate an additional 2700 MW of electrical generating capacity, which would double the capacity of the site.\nThe total estimated cost of constructing the two reactors is $10 billion, or $13 billion with financing, according to Steve Bartley, interim general manager at CPS Energy.\n\nIn October 2009, main contractor Toshiba had informed CPS Energy that the cost would be \"substantially greater,\" possibly up to $4 billion more. As a result of the escalating cost estimates for units 3 and 4, in 2010 CPS Energy reached an agreement with NRG Energy to reduce CPS's stake in the new units from 50% to 7.625%. To that point, CPS Energy had invested $370 Million in the expanded plant. CPS Energy's withdrawal from the project put the expansion into jeopardy.\n\nIn October 2010, the South Texas Project announced that the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) had entered into an agreement with Nuclear Innovation North America (a joint venture between the reactor manufacturer, Toshiba, and plant partner NRG Energy) which was the largest of the two stakeholders in the proposed reactors, to purchase an initial 9.2375% stake in the expansion for $125 Million, and $30 Million for an option to purchase an additional stake in the new units for $125 Million more (resulting in approximately 18% ownership by TEPCO, or 500MW of generation capacity). The agreement was made conditional upon STNP securing construction loan guarantees from the United States Department of Energy.\n\nOn 19 April 2011, NRG announced in a conference call with shareholders, that they had decided to abandon the permitting process on the two new units due to the ongoing expense of planning and slow permitting process. Anti-nuclear campaigners alleged that the financial situation of new partner TEPCO, combined with the ongoing Fukushima nuclear accident were also key factors in the decision. NRG has written off its investment of $331 million in the project.\n\nDespite the April 2011 NRG announcement of the reactor's cancellation, the NRC continued the combined licensing process for the new reactors in October 2011. It was unclear at the time why the reactor license application was proceeding. During early 2015 some pre-construction activities were performed on site and initial NRC documents listed the original targeted commercial operational dates as March 2015 for unit 3 and a year later for the other unit. \nOn February 9, 2016 the NRC approved the combined license. Due to market conditions, no construction events occurred at that time. The two planned units do not currently have a planned construction date.\n\nNuclear whistleblower Ronald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by EBASCO, which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant.\n\nSAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Goldstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection for reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers.\n\nThe STPEGS reactors are operated by the STP Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC). Ownership is divided among NRG Energy at 44 percent, San Antonio municipal utility CPS Energy at 40 percent and Austin Energy at 16 percent.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within was 254,049, an increase of 10.2 percent since 2000 according to an \"msnbc.com\" report by Bill Dedman Cities within 50 miles include Lake Jackson (40 miles to city center) and Bay City.

Ulysses S. Grant ordered the project, started on June 27, 1862, with two goals in mind. The first was to alter the course of the Mississippi River in order to bypass the Confederate guns at Vicksburg, Mississippi. For various technical reasons the project failed to meet this goal. The river did change course by itself on April 26, 1876. But the project did meet its second goal, keeping troops occupied during the laborious maneuvering required to begin the Battle of Vicksburg. A small remnant of the canal is part of Vicksburg National Military Park.\n\nDuring the summer of 1862, as the ships of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut bombarded the Vicksburg river defenses, a 3,000-man infantry brigade commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas Williams began work on this canal across the base of De Soto Point on the west side of the Mississippi River across from Vicksburg. The purpose of the canal was to develop a channel for navigation that would enable gunboats and transports to bypass the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg.\n\nIt was thought that the scouring effect of the Mississippi River's current would keep the canal open. Some believed that the man-made channel would possibly even catch enough of the currents force to cause the river to change course, leaving Vicksburg high and dry and making it worthless militarily without firing a shot. Work on the canal commenced on June 27, 1862, as soldiers from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Michigan began felling trees, grubbing roots, and excavating dirt. Heat exhaustion, sunstroke, and disease took a heavy toll of human life. To augment his fast-dwindling workforce, Williams employed some 1,100-1,200 African-Americans that had been gathered from neighboring plantations by armed parties. In spite of the heat, the canal was excavated to a depth of and a width of . However, the Mississippi River dropped faster than the Union could dig. \nBy July 24, work on the canal stopped and Williams' weary soldiers accompanied the West Gulf Blockading Squadron as Farragut withdrew southward to safer water.\n\nIn January 1863, work on the canal was resumed by troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Although placing little confidence in the success of the project, Grant approved of the idea as it would keep his soldiers in good physical condition for the spring campaign, and more importantly, keep the spirit of the offensive alive.\n\nAs the soldiers and African-Americans that had been pressed into service dug lower, there was a sudden rise in the river that broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, \"Hercules\" and \"Sampson\", were put to work clearing the channel. The dredges, however, were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and were driven away. By late March, Grant had decided to make a bold change in his Vicksburg campaign operations and work on the canal was abandoned.\n\nGrant's Canal has national significance as part of Vicksburg National Military Park and because its construction comprised military activity that had an observable influence on the direction and conduct of the Vicksburg campaign. Although the efforts to construct the canal ended in failure, they are associated with early Federal campaign plans to eliminate the Confederate presence at Vicksburg.\n\nMuch of Williams' Canal/Grant's Canal has been obliterated by agricultural operations since the Civil War. This is the only segment that retains its original width and much of its depth. The tract was donated to the National Park Service by local landowners working in conjunction with The Conservation Fund and became part of Vicksburg National Military Park in 1990. Thus, the National Park Service currently protects and interprets the resources.\n\n\nhttp://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lamadiso/articles/canals.htm\n\nGrant's Canal, the Union's Attempt to Bypass Vicksburg, David F.

The lanes and the ETC system are owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation.\n\nSolo drivers who are registered under the MnPASS program and have a toll transponder are allowed to pay a toll to use the lanes during operating hours. Vehicles with two or more occupants, buses, and motorcycles may use the lanes for free without requiring a toll transponder.\n\nThere are three types of MnPASS transponders. The Sticker Tag is the default tag, is free, and is applied to the inside of the windshield. The Sticker Tag is not transferable and is always active.\n\nThe License Plate Tag is used for vehicles that have a metallic tint on their windshield that would prevent the MnPASS equipment from reading the tag. There is a US$15 one-time fee for the License Plate Tag, which otherwise functions the same as the Sticker Tag.\n\nFor a flexible option, there is also a Switchable Tag. The Switchable Tag allows users to switch between HOV mode (where using the lanes is free) and solo mode (where users must pay the toll to use the lanes). The Switchable Tag also has a US$15 one-time fee.\n\nThe initial minimum prepaid amount for a MnPASS account is US$25, plus the cost of an alternative transponder type if applicable.\n\nSmall commercial vehicles that are no more than 2 axles and weigh less than 26,000 pounds are eligible to register for a MnPASS account and transponder. Commercial vehicles with more than 2 axles or weigh more than 26,000 pounds are prohibited from having a MnPASS transponder, but may still use the MnPASS lanes when the lanes are free and open to all traffic.\n\nCurrently, the MnPASS system is not interoperable with other transponder-based toll systems, such as E-ZPass, I-Pass, or FasTrak. However, MnPASS has stated that interoperability with the E-ZPass System is expected to begin mid-2021.\n\nDuring MnPASS operating hours, tolls for the MnPASS lanes range from US$0.25 to US$8. The actual toll level depends on the volume of traffic. Higher volumes of traffic usually result in higher toll levels. Electronic sensors monitor the traffic density and tolls are changed every three minutes. The variable tolls are intended to keep traffic in the MnPASS lanes moving between 50 and 55 miles per hour. Outside of operating hours, there is no toll and the lanes are free (signed simply as \"OPEN\") and open to all traffic (regardless of whether they have a transponder or not) with one exception: the reversible MnPASS lanes on Interstate 394 between Highway 100 and Interstate 94 always has a minimum US$0.25 toll and thus are not open to solo drivers without a MnPASS transponder.\n\nThe Interstate 394 MnPASS lanes opened in May, 2005 and were the first such lanes in Minnesota. The lanes were converted from the previous high-occupancy vehicle lanes that were constructed with Interstate 394 in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nWest of the Xenia/Park Place interchange (just west of Highway 100, the MnPASS lanes function as concurrent flow lanes, utilizing the inside/left lane in each direction. These lanes are separated from the general purpose lanes only by lane striping, as are the Interstate 35W and Interstate 35E MnPASS lanes. The lane striping ranges from a single dashed white line where lane changes (and MnPASS lane access) is allowed to double solid white lines where lane changing is prohibited. The westbound MnPASS lane ends at the Interstate 494 overpass (continuing west of I-494 as a general purpose lane), while the eastbound MnPASS lane begins at the County Road 15 interchange on Highway 12 in Wayzata. These concurrent flow MnPASS lanes are tolled eastbound between 6-10am weekdays and westbound between 3-7pm weekdays. They are open to all traffic at all other times.\n\nEast of the Xenia/Park Place interchange, the MnPASS lanes transition to a pair of median-running reversible lanes that are physically separated from the general purpose lanes by a concrete barrier. These lanes extend to the edge of downtown Minneapolis before ending and merging into the Interstate 394 mainline at Interstate 94. Intermediate access to these reversible MnPASS lane is limited to Highway 100, the south frontage road at Highway 100, Dunwoody Boulevard/Van White Boulevard, and Interstate 94 in the direction of the Lowry Hill Tunnel. The lanes are open eastbound (towards downtown) from 6am to 1pm daily, and westbound (away from downtown) daily from 2pm to 5am the following morning. Hours may vary due to special events or maintenance activities.\n\nThere were a total of over 1.3 million tolled trips taken in the Interstate 394 MnPASS lanes in 2017.\n\nThe MnPASS lanes along Interstate 35W south of downtown Minneapolis were opened in stages between 2009 and 2011 and are a combination of new construction (south of Burnsville Parkway), conversion of the previously existing high-occupancy vehicle lanes (between Burnsville Parkway and 66th Street), construction related to the Crosstown Commons project, and conversion of a median shoulder into a priced dynamic shoulder lane. The lanes are concurrent-flow lanes using the inside/left lane in each direction. The northbound MnPASS lane begins at County Road 42 and extends continuously to 26th Street. The southbound MnPASS Lane begins just south of 42nd Street and extends to Cliff Road.\n\nThe northbound MnPASS lane is tolled weekdays between 6-10am and the segment north of Highway 62 is also tolled between 3-7pm. The southbound MnPASS lane is tolled weekdays between 3-7pm with the segment between 42nd Street and Interstate 494 also tolled between 6-10am. The lanes are open to all traffic at all other times.\n\nAlmost 950,000 tolled trips were taken in the Interstate 35W MnPASS lanes in 2017.\n\nThe future Orange Line bus rapid transitway is expected to heavily utilize the Interstate 35W MnPASS lanes.\n\nThe Interstate 35E MnPASS lanes are the first such lanes in the eastern half of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area. These are concurrent-flow lanes, using the inside/left lane in each direction. The lanes were opened from Cayuga Street (north edge of downtown St. Paul) to Little Canada Road in December, 2015 and were added as part of a full reconstruction project. In December, 2016, the southbound MnPASS lane was extended to begin at County Road 96, while a separate northbound MnPASS Lane was added between County Road E (north of Interstate 694) and County Road J (at the Ramsey/Anoka County line. The two northbound MnPASS lanes are tolled weekdays between 3-7pm, while the southbound MnPASS lane is tolled weekdays between 6-10am. The lanes are open to all traffic at all other times.\n\nApproximately 440,000 tolled trips were taken in the Interstate 35E MnPASS lanes in 2017.\n\nThe Interstate 494 MnPASS lanes are yet to be constructed, but will be constructed between 2021 and 2023. Westbound there will be a MnPASS lane from MN 77 to I-35W, and eastbound from France Avenue to MN 77. The project is part of a major corridor study happening on Interstate 494.\n\nAs part of a massive reconstruction project on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis, the existing priced dynamic shoulder lane will be converted into a full MnPASS lane, and a new southbound MnPASS lane will be constructed, extending both lanes northward to 26th Street. Tentative completion is 2021.\n\nMnPASS lanes will be added to Interstate 35W between County Road C in Roseville and Lexington Avenue/County Road 17 in Blaine in an upcoming project beginning in 2019 with completion expected in 2022.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Transportation is currently studying the Interstate 94 corridor between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul. No recommendations have come out of this study yet as of April 2018. However, the corridor is listed as a Tier 1 Corridor for MnPASS implementation by the Metropolitan Council, the region's Metropolitan planning organization.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Transportation is currently studying the Highway 169 corridor between Highway 41 near Shakopee and Highway 55 in Plymouth. MnPASS lanes are one of the options being considered.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806534", "title": "Dynamic Source Routing", "text": "Dynamic Source Routing\n\nDynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. It is similar to AODV in that it forms a route on-demand when a transmitting node requests one. However, it uses source routing instead of relying on the routing table at each intermediate device.\n\nDetermining source route requires accumulating the address of each device between the source and destination during route discovery. The accumulated path information is cached by nodes processing the route discovery packets. The learned paths are used to route packets. To accomplish source routing, the routed packets contain the address of each device the packet will traverse. This may result in high overhead for long paths or large addresses, like IPv6. To avoid using source routing, DSR optionally defines a flow id option that allows packets to be forwarded on a hop-by-hop basis.\n\nThis protocol is truly based on source routing whereby all the routing information is maintained (continually updated) at mobile nodes.\nIt has only two major phases, which are Route Discovery and Route Maintenance.\nRoute Reply would only be generated if the message has reached the intended destination node (route record which is initially contained in Route Request would be inserted into the Route Reply).\n\nTo return the Route Reply, the destination node must have a route to the source node. If the route is in the Destination Node's route cache, the route would be used. Otherwise, the node will reverse the route based on the route record in the Route Request message header (this requires that all links are symmetric).\nIn the event of fatal transmission, the Route Maintenance Phase is initiated whereby the Route Error packets are generated at a node. The erroneous hop will be removed from the node's route cache; all routes containing the hop are truncated at that point. Again, the Route Discovery Phase is initiated to determine the most viable route.\n\nFor information on other similar protocols, see the ad hoc routing protocol list.\n\nDynamic source routing protocol (DSR) is an on-demand protocol designed to restrict the bandwidth consumed by control packets in ad hoc wireless networks by eliminating the periodic table-update messages required in the table-driven approach. The major difference between this and the other on-demand routing protocols is that it is beacon-less and hence does not require periodic hello packet (beacon) transmissions, which are used by a node to inform its neighbors of its presence. The basic approach of this protocol (and all other on-demand routing protocols) during the route construction phase is to establish a route by flooding RouteRequest packets in the network. The destination node, on receiving a RouteRequest packet, responds by sending a RouteReply packet back to the source, which carries the route traversed by the RouteRequest packet received.\n\nConsider a source node that does not have a route to the destination. When it has data packets to be sent to that destination, it initiates a RouteRequest packet. This RouteRequest is flooded throughout the network. Each node, upon receiving a RouteRequest packet, rebroadcasts the packet to its neighbors if it has not forwarded it already, provided that the node is not the destination node and that the packet’s time to live (TTL) counter has not been exceeded. Each RouteRequest carries a sequence number generated by the source node and the path it has traversed. A node, upon receiving a RouteRequest packet, checks the sequence number on the packet before forwarding it. The packet is forwarded only if it is not a duplicate RouteRequest. The sequence number on the packet is used to prevent loop formations and to avoid multiple transmissions of the same RouteRequest by an intermediate node that receives it through multiple paths. Thus, all nodes except the destination forward a RouteRequest packet during the route construction phase. A destination node, after receiving the first RouteRequest packet, replies to the source node through the reverse path the RouteRequest packet had traversed. Nodes can also learn about the neighboring routes traversed by data packets if operated in the promiscuous mode (the mode of operation in which a node can receive the packets that are neither broadcast nor addressed to itself). This route cache is also used during the route construction phase.\n\nThis protocol uses a reactive approach which eliminates the need to periodically flood the network with table update messages which are required in a table-driven approach. In a reactive (on-demand) approach such as this, a route is established only when it is required and hence the need to find routes to all other nodes in the network as required by the table-driven approach is eliminated. The intermediate nodes also utilize the route cache information efficiently to reduce the control overhead. The disadvantage of this protocol is that the route maintenance mechanism does not locally repair a broken link. Stale route cache information could also result in inconsistencies during the route reconstruction phase. The connection setup delay is higher than in table-driven protocols. Even though the protocol performs well in static and low-mobility environments, the performance degrades rapidly with increasing mobility. Also, considerable routing overhead is involved due to the source-routing mechanism employed in DSR. This routing overhead is directly proportional to the path length.\n\nIt was first described in:\n\n"}
{"id": "1806538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806538", "title": "Hemoencephalography", "text": "Hemoencephalography\n\nHemoencephalography (HEG) is a relatively new neurofeedback technique within the field of neurotherapy. Neurofeedback, a specific form of biofeedback, is based on the idea that human beings can consciously alter their brain function through training sessions in which they attempt to change the signal generated by their brain and measured via some neurological feedback mechanism. By so doing, participants increase cerebral blood flow to a specified region of the brain, consequently increasing brain activity and performance on tasks involving that region of the brain.\n\nBoth approaches to hemoencephalography, near infrared and passive infrared, are indirect measures of neural activity based on neurovascular coupling. Neurovascular coupling is the mechanism by which cerebral blood flow is matched to metabolic activity. When a region of the cortex is used in a specific cognitive task, neuronal activity in that region increases, consequently increasing local metabolic rate. To keep up with the nutritional and waste removal demands of a higher metabolic rate, cerebral blood flow to the cortical area in use must increase proportionally. Along with the increase in flow, hemoglobin molecules in the blood, which are responsible for the transport and transference of oxygen to tissue throughout the body, must increase the amount of oxygen they deliver to the activated region of the cortex, resulting in a greater local blood oxygenation level. This is also referred to as the haemodynamic response.\n\nDeveloped by Dr. Hershel Toomim, near infrared hemoencephalography measures changes in the local oxygenation level of the blood. Similar to functional magnetic resonance imaging, which uses changes in the magnetic properties of blood resulting from oxygenation to form an image of brain activity, NIR utilizes the changes in blood translucence resulting from oxygenation to generate a signal that can be consciously manipulated in neurofeedback sessions. At the most basic level, NIR hemoencephalography shines alternating red (660 nm) and near infra-red (850 nm) light on a specified area of the brain, usually through the forehead. While the skull is largely translucent to these wavelengths of light, blood is not. The red light is used as a probe, while the infrared light provides a relatively stable baseline for comparison. Photoelectric cells in a spectrophotometer device worn on the forehead measure the amount of each wavelength of light reflected by cerebral blood flow in the activated cortical tissue and send the data to a computer, which then calculates the ratio of red to infrared light and translates it into a visual signal of corresponding to oxygenation level on a graphical interface the patient can see. The key nutrient monitored by NIR is oxygen. In NIR, as the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) to deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) increases, the blood becomes less and less translucent and scatters more of the red light, instead of absorbing it. In contrast, the amount of infrared light scattered by the blood is largely impermeable to changes in the oxygenation level of hemoglobin.\n\nDeveloped by Dr. Jeffrey Carmen, a privately practicing psychologist in New York, passive infrared HEG is a marriage of the classic hemoencephalography principles employed by Toomim and a technique known as thermoscopy. PIR uses a sensor similar to the NIR sensor to detect light from a narrow band of the infrared spectrum that corresponds to the amount of heat being generated by an active brain region, as well as the local blood oxygenation level. The heat detected by PIR is proportional to the amount of sugar being burned to maintain the increased metabolic rate necessary to fuel elevated neuronal activity. PIR has a poorer resolution than NIR and this treatment typically focuses on more global increases in cerebral blood flow.\n\nThe first true instance of neurofeedback occurred in 1963, when University of Chicago professor Joseph Kamiya trained a volunteer to recognize and alter alpha brain wave activity. Just five years later, Barry Sterman conducted a revolutionary study on cats at the behest of NASA that proved that cats trained to consciously alter their sensorimotor rhythm were resistant to doses of hydrazine that typically induce seizures. This finding was applied to humans in 1971 when Sterman trained an epileptic to control her seizures through a combination of sensorimotor rhythm and EEG neurotherapy to the extent that she obtained a driver's license after only three months of treatment. Around the same time Hershel Toomim was founding Toomim Biofeedback Laboratories and Biocomp Research Institute on the basis of a device known as the Alpha Pacer that measured brain waves. After decades of work with various biofeedback mechanisms, Toomim accidentally stumbled upon conscious control of cerebral blood flow in 1994. He developed a device specific to this measure that he called a Near Infrared Spectrophotometry Hemencephalography system, coining the term \"hemoencephalography\", in 1997. A clinician user of NIR HEG, Jeffrey Carmen, adapted Toomim's system for migraines in 2002 by integrating peripheral thermal biofeedback into the design. Since then, both techniques have been applied to numerous disorders of frontal and prefrontal lobe function. Sherrill, R. (2004).\n\nPrior to training with the HEG device, patients are given a standardized pre test, most often the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), to assess baseline cognitive functioning. Patient progress will be tracked using the same measure at the beginning and end of every neurotherapy session. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) assessments may also be conducted pre and post treatment, depending on the patient's disorder. Training sessions are typically 45 minutes to an hour in length, with intermittent breaks. At the outset, all sessions are performed at a certified neurotherapy provider's clinic (though some at-home options are now available) and begin 2-3 times weekly in frequency. Depending on the patient, training may last from a couple of months to a couple of years. High variability in red light activity (large range from low to high output) is typically characteristic of people with problems of the prefrontal cortex. Low variability is associated with more normal functioning. The ratio of red/infrared light refraction is displayed as a visual signal on a computer monitor and may also be translated into an auditory signal in which higher pitch corresponds to greater oxygenation. During a HEG training session patients attempt to increase the signal generated by the HEG sensor. Progress is measured by reduced variability.\n\nCurrently, the most popular neurotherapy techniques utilize electroencephalography (EEG), which measures electrical brain activity rather than blood flow. Proponents of hemoencephalography maintain that HEG has advantages over EEG, namely:\n\nThe main practical limitations of HEG as compared to EEG are:\n\nOther disadvantages of HEG mirror current frustrations with fMRI and stem from the indirect nature of both techniques and reliance on individual patterns of cerebral blood flow:\n\nMost research in HEG has focused on disorders of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the cortical region directly behind the forehead that controls high level executive functions such as planning, judgment, emotional regulation, inhibition, organization, and cause and effect determination. The prefrontal cortex is thought essential for all goal-directed and socially-mediated behavior. The PFC is an ideal target for HEG due to both its location on the scalp (behind the forehead, where there is no hair to disrupt the scattering of the red and infrared light) and the susceptibility of its primary functions to learning.\n\nResearch with PIR has focused almost exclusively on alleviating tension headaches and migraines. A four-year study of 100 chronic migraine sufferers found that after as few as six 30-minute training sessions, 90% of patients reported significant improvements with their migraines. Another study conducted combined the biofeedback measures of EEG, hemoencephalography and thermal handwarming during thrice weekly sessions for 14 months. 70% of sufferers saw a 50% or more reduction in their migraines following combined neurotherapy and drug treatment, as opposed to 50% undergoing only traditional drug therapy.\n\nThe term autism encompasses a wide range of syndromes, such as Rett disorder, pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and Asperger's syndrome, that are collectively referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All ASD sufferers exhibit impaired understanding and performance of social and communicative skills, impulsivity, difficulties with attention and some mode of obsessive behavior. Many patients with ASD have normal to above normal intelligence, but exhibit wildly abnormal EEG readings, which combined with symptoms synonymous with impaired executive control make them prime candidates for pre-frontal centric neurotherapy. The myriad of studies exploring the potency of neurotherapy as a treatment for ASD have primarily involved EEG and QEEG, but one recent study investigated the efficacy of both NIR and PIR training against a QEEG only control group and found that, according to parental reports, those in both HEG groups experienced a more than 50% decrease in symptoms. These reports were supported by decreased EEG variability and improvements on measures of neurobiological and neuropsychological functioning. NIR was found to have a greater impact on attention, while PIR had greater efficacy in the realms of emotional regulation and social interactions.\n\nWith many symptoms reminiscent of ASD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has also been a focus of HEG research. In one typical case study, an adolescent with ADHD\npresented with highly abnormal QEEG readings and attentional scores on neuropsychological tests. After only ten biweekly HEG training sessions, he rendered a completely normal QEEG reading and significantly improved scores on attentional measures. Notable about this research is that the improvements persisted eighteen months post-treatment, allowing the patient to greatly reduce the drug therapy necessary for him to function successfully in school and offering a quick and relatively cheap treatment alternative for school systems and parents of children with ADD/ADHD.\n\nA large group of researchers headed up by Dr. Hershel Toomim and his wife Marjorie have repeatedly found that NIR HEG training can consciously enhance regional cerebral oxygenation to specific areas of the brain and result in increased performance on cognitive tasks. It is widely known that regular cardiovascular exercise results in increased cerebral blood flow due to increased vascularization of the capillaries feeding neuronal tissue. Toomim, Mize, Kwong \"et al.\" found that after only ten 30-minute sessions of HEG brain exercise training, participants with various neurological disorders showed increases in attention and decreases in impulsivity to within normal levels. A subset of participants also experienced increases in cerebral vascularization similar to those witnessed upon increasing physical activity. More importantly, degree of improvement was found to be reliably related to the initial TOVA score of each participant, with the lowest initial TOVA scores exhibiting the greatest improvement.\n\nIn addition, HEG has shown promise at alleviating depression, stress and chronic anxiety. There is also work done by Dr. Luis Gaviria at Las Americas Hospital, where neurosurgery patients were given 20 minutes HEG sessions, as part of their rehabilitation process. These patients showed improvement in reconnecting with their loved ones, compared to their control counterparts.\n"}

He played college football at Troy as a defensive end and was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys with the 11th overall pick in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. After spending nine seasons with the Cowboys, Ware departed in 2013 as the franchise's all-time leader in quarterback sacks with 117. Ware then played three seasons for the Denver Broncos, with whom he won Super Bowl 50 over the Carolina Panthers. After the 2016 season with the Broncos, he announced his retirement from the NFL. In 2017, he signed a one-day contract with Dallas to retire as a Cowboy. In 2018, the Broncos hired Ware as a pass-rush consultant.\n\nWare was born on July 31, 1982, in Auburn, Alabama. He attended Ogletree Elementary School. Ware played football, basketball, baseball, and ran track in high school; he attended Auburn High School (with defensive end Osi Umenyiora and linebacker Marcus Washington). In football, Ware played both linebacker and wide receiver, and as a senior, he won every game, and was named the team's Most Valuable Wide Receiver and Most Valuable Linebacker, and won Top Leadership honors. He finished his senior season with seven sacks and 55 total tackles (40 solo tackles, 15 assisted tackles).\n\nIn track & field, Ware was one of the state's top performers in the long jump (PB of 7.14 meters). He ran the 55 metres in 6.74 seconds and had a personal-best jump of 1.94 meters in the high jump.\n\nWare accepted a scholarship from Troy University, where he was a two-time All-Sun Belt Conference selection for the Troy Trojans football team.\n\nWare became a starter at defensive end as a sophomore, and was a part of a defensive line that included future NFL player Osi Umenyiora. He posted 72 tackles (fifth on the team) and 19.5 tackles for loss. The next year, he registered 62 tackles, 16 tackles for a loss, 6 sacks, 32 quarterback hurries (led the team), 5 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nAs a senior, Ware was a dominant player, receiving the Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year, and was a finalist for the Hendricks Award, which is given annually to the top defensive end in college football. In 2004, he helped lead his team to the school's first-ever bowl appearance, the Silicon Valley Football Classic. He posted 53 tackles, 10.5 sacks (led the Sun Belt Conference), 19 tackles for loss and 4 forced fumbles.\n\nWare finished his college career with 27.5 sacks, 201 tackles, 74 quarterback hurries, ten forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries, and one interception. His 27.5 sacks rank second in school history for sacks in a career, and his 55.5 tackles for losses rank first in school history.\n\nWare was named to the Sun Belt Conference All-Decade Team. In 2012, he was inducted into the Troy University Sports Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was inducted into the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame.\n\nA defensive end at Troy, Ware was considered a \"tweener DE/OLB prospect\" by most scouts. He was supposed to be a perfect fit as rush linebacker in 3-4 defense prior the 2005 NFL Draft and was projected to go early in the second round by \"Sports Illustrated\". Prospect Marcus Spears was considered by head coach Bill Parcells to be the key to the team's eventual move to a 3-4 defense and wanted to take him with the first selection (11th overall pick). Owner/general manager Jerry Jones overruled Parcells and selected Ware instead, who the team thought would not be available later in the draft. Spears was selected by the Cowboys with the 20th overall pick.\nWare also was credited with a 430-pound bench press, a 570-pound squat, and a 360-pound power clean.\n\nIn his NFL debut against the San Diego Chargers, Ware posted three tackles, one for a loss, and one quarterback pressure. The Cowboys won the game 28-24. In a game against San Francisco in Week 3, he recorded his first sack bringing down Tim Rattay. Ware earned the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month award for October after recording 16 tackles, three sacks, and seven quarterback pressures to help Dallas start the season with a 3-2 record. In Week 16, Ware recorded three sacks and three forced fumbles in a match against the Carolina Panthers. For that performance, Ware was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week and the Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week. He also tied the Cowboys record for most sacks in a single game, held by Randy White. He finished with 58 total tackles, 14 tackles for losses and three forced fumbles. He tied Greg Ellis for a team-best eight sacks and joined Jimmie Jones as the only rookies to ever lead or tie for the Dallas Cowboys' team lead in sacks. Ware finished tied for 24th in the league in sacks in a year where Derrick Burgess led the league in sacks with 16.\n\nIn 2006, Ware ended the regular season with a team-high 11.5 sacks, the most ever by a Cowboys linebacker. This total broke Anthony Dickerson's record of 10.5 from 1983. He added 73 tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception, both returned for a touchdown. Ware was named a starter on the NFC Pro Bowl team and was also named Second-team All-Pro by The Associated Press. In Week 6 against division rival Eagles, Ware had a memorable moment with his 69-yard fumble return for his first career NFL touchdown. He recorded his first career interception against Michael Vick in a game against Atlanta Falcons and returned it for a 41-yard touchdown. Ware finished tied for ninth in the league in total sacks and Shawne Merriman led the league with 17 sacks.\n\nWare broke out with his 2007 season, leading new Cowboys' head coach Wade Phillips to call him the best outside linebacker in the league. Ware became the second Cowboy ever to record at least 14 sacks in a season, since Jim Jeffcoat in 1986. Ware led the team with 27 quarterback pressures, eight tackles for losses, and four forced fumbles while finishing with 80 tackles. Ware made his second straight Pro Bowl along with 12 other teammates. He was also selected to the All-Pro team for the second straight year along with teammates, Terrell Owens and Jason Witten. Ware finished tied for third in the league behind Patrick Kerney (14.5 sacks) and Jared Allen (15.5 sacks).\n\nIn the 2008 matchup against the St. Louis Rams, Ware tied the NFL record of former Denver Broncos linebacker Simon Fletcher for recording a sack in ten straight games. Ware was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl after pacing the league, establishing an official club record and tying Derrick Thomas for sixth in league history with 20 sacks. Ware ended the 2008 season with 84 tackles, 9 tackles for a loss, six forced fumbles, and two passes defended. Ware was named NFC Defensive Player of the Year by Kansas City Committee as well as NFL Alumni Pass Rusher of the Year. Ware became the first recipient of the professional Butkus Award. Ware finished the 2008 season as the league leader in sacks for the first time in his career. Joey Porter finished second on the list with 17.5 sacks and John Abraham third with 16.5 sacks.\n\nIn 2009, Ware was listed as the best 3-4 outside linebacker by \"Sporting News\" In October, Ware signed a six-year, $78 million contract, putting him among the top-five highest paid defenders in the NFL. Two months later, Ware suffered a neck injury and was taken off the field by a cart while playing against the San Diego Chargers. The injury was diagnosed later as a sprained neck. He was taken to the hospital for further tests, but was released the next day. He came back to play the very next week, against the then-undefeated New Orleans Saints, and recorded two sack-fumbles, including the one that ended the Saints' chances at a comeback and an undefeated season. For this performance, he was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week. He made his fourth consecutive appearance in the Pro Bowl as a starter in 2009, after leading the Cowboys with 11.0 sacks, a career-high 45 pressures, and five forced fumbles. He was named to the First All-Pro team in recognition of his 2009 season.\n\nWare recorded 15.5 sacks and led the NFL in that category for the second time in three seasons. He made a fifth straight Pro Bowl and garnered another All-Pro nomination. By leading the NFL in sacks for the second time in his career, Ware tied the record for most seasons leading the league in sacks with two. He tied Mark Gastineau, 1983–84; Reggie White, 1987–88; Kevin Greene, 1994, 1996; Michael Strahan, 2001, 2003; and Jared Allen, 2007, 2011.\n\nIn 2011, Ware had 19.5 sacks, 47 tackles, two pass deflections, and two forced fumbles. Ware ended the season only half sack away from both becoming the first player in NFL history to post multiple 20+ sack seasons and becoming the 29th player in NFL history to reach 100+ career sacks. In addition, Ware was 2.5 sacks shy of becoming the first player ever to lead the league in sacks three times. Earlier in the season, Ware was on pace to pass Michael Strahan's sack record of 22.5 sacks in a season but ultimately fell short. On October 30, 2011, Ware recorded a career-high four sacks against the Philadelphia Eagles in a 34-7 loss. Ware finished second in the NFL in total sacks for the 2011 season behind Jared Allen who posted 22.0 sacks. Ware was selected to the 2012 Pro Bowl as a starter and voted to the All-Pro team again.\n\nIn the season opener against the defending Super Bowl Champion New York Giants at MetLife Stadium, Ware recorded two sacks against Eli Manning to reach 101.5 sacks for his career. With these two sacks Ware became the second fastest player (113 games) to reach 100 sacks behind Reggie White (96 games) while also becoming just the 29th player in NFL history to reach 100 or more sacks. At the end of the 2012 season, Ware finished with 11.5 sacks, five forced fumbles and was selected to his seventh Pro Bowl and was named to the Second All-Pro team. Ware was unable to play in the Pro Bowl after his off-season shoulder surgery. He endured a difficult season having to deal with a hamstring he tore in training camp, a fractured right wrist and losing mobility on his right arm in the last three games, because of a hyperextended elbow and a torn labrum that forced him to use an elbow and shoulder harness.\n\nDue to the Cowboys switch to the 4-3 from the 3-4, under new defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, DeMarcus moved to defensive end, along with Anthony Spencer, who started his NFL career opposite Ware at left side linebacker, but was a defensive end at college. Under Kiffin's system, Ware was able to dedicate himself as a pass-rusher. Despite becoming a pure pass rusher, on his first play as a defensive end, Ware picked off Giants quarterback Eli Manning. In Week 3 against the St. Louis Rams, he became the Cowboys' all-time sack leader, surpassing Harvey Martin's 30-year-old record of 114.\n\nAfter nine seasons with the Cowboys, Ware was released on March 11, 2014, making him a free agent for the first time in his career.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, one day following his release from the Cowboys, Ware signed a three-year, $30 million contract with the Denver Broncos. The deal included $20 million in guaranteed money. Ware started at right outside linebacker for the team. He played 16 games, of which he started 15, finishing the season with 41 tackles, 10 sacks, one interception, one pass defensed, and two forced fumbles. He received Pro Bowl honors in his first season with the Broncos.\n\nFor the 2015 season, Ware was reunited with former head coach Wade Phillips as his defensive coordinator. The Broncos finished the season with the #1 defense and a 12-4 record. Ware posted 25 tackles and 7.5 sacks while playing in 11 of the regular season games, missing five games due to injury. In September, he earned AFC defensive player of the month honors. He was ranked 36th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n\nIn the Divisional Round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ware had 3 tackles, recovered a crucial fumble near the end of the game, and recorded the game winning sack to help the Broncos win 23-16. Ware advanced to the Conference Championship for the first time in his career. In the AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, Ware and the defense hit quarterback Tom Brady 27 times and placed pressure on him the entire game. The Broncos held on to win the game by a score of 20-18. On February 7, 2016, Ware was part of the Broncos team that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24–10. Ware recorded five tackles and two sacks in the Super Bowl.\n\nIn a Week 1 Super Bowl 50 rematch against the Carolina Panthers, Ware recorded a team leading 1.5 sacks and helped the Broncos beat the Panthers by a score of 21-20. In Week 2 against the Colts, Ware left the game with an apparent arm injury as he was trying to bring down quarterback Andrew Luck. It was eventually revealed that there was an ulna fracture near the elbow. The injury required surgery with 4–5 weeks to recover. Ware went on to play 10 games recording four sacks before having season-ending back surgery on December 28, 2016.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, Ware announced his retirement from the NFL after 12 seasons and 138.5 sacks, through his Twitter account.\nOn April 24, 2017, about a month after announcing his retirement from the NFL, Ware signed a one-day contract to retire as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, the team that drafted him.\n\nWare is tied for the record of most seasons leading the league in sacks with two (2008 and 2010). Ware is tied with Mark Gastineau, 1983–84; Reggie White, 1987–88; Kevin Greene, 1994, 1996; Michael Strahan, 2001, 2003; Jared Allen, 2007, 2011; and JJ Watt, 2012, 2015.\n\nAs of the end of the 2012 season, Ware recorded 10+ sacks in seven straight seasons. Only two other players in NFL history have more consecutive seasons with 10+ sacks: Reggie White (9), John Randle (8)\n\nPete Prisco, CBS Sports Senior NFL Columnist, ranked Ware as the 3rd best player in the NFL (behind Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady) going into the 2012 season and as the best defensive player in the NFL. In 2012, NFL.com analyst Daniel Jeremiah ranked Ware as the best edge pass rusher in the league and a \"top-five player in the NFL, regardless of position\". The NFL Top 100 for 2012 ranked Ware as the best rusher, best linebacker, 2nd overall defensive player behind defensive back Darrelle Revis (number 5 overall) and the 6th overall player in the NFL.\n\nWare is the second fastest player ever to reach 100+ sacks (Reggie White is the fastest) and the 29th player in history to do so.\n\nWare recorded 28 multiple-sack games and 32 forced fumbles as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, both most in club history.\n\nWare has ranked in the top three in total sacks league-wide in 4 out of 5 seasons (3rd place in 2007, 1st place in 2008, 7th place in 2009, 1st place in 2010, and 2nd place in 2011).\n\nOn April 19, 2016, the governor of Alabama declared April 19 \"DeMarcus Ware Day\" in his honor.\n\n\nIn March 2005, Ware married his high school sweetheart, Taniqua Smith, a former Air Force member and the daughter of a police officer. After three difficult pregnancies, including the birth and death of a son, Omar, in 2006, they adopted their daughter, Marley. In 2010, they had a son, DeMarcus Ware, II.\n\nWare and Smith divorced in 2012.\n\nOn September 12, 2018, Ware was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 27 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". His professional partner was Lindsay Arnold. Ware and Arnold were eliminated on the seventh week of competition, finishing in joint-seventh place alongside John Schneider and his professional partner Emma Slater.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806556", "title": "Deliriant", "text": "Deliriant\n\nDeliriants are a class of hallucinogen. The term was introduced by David F. Duncan and Robert S. Gold to distinguish these drugs from psychedelics and dissociatives, such as LSD and ketamine respectively, due to their primary effect of causing delirium, as opposed to the more lucid states produced by such other hallucinogens as are represented by psychedelics and dissociatives. The term is generally used to refer to anticholinergic drugs which are substances that inhibit the function of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\nThe delirium produced, particularly by anticholinergics is characterized by stupor, agitation, confusion, confabulation, dysphoria, akathisia, realistic visual hallucinations or illusions (as opposed to the pseudohallucinations experienced on other classes of hallucinogens) and regression to \"phantom\" behaviors such as disrobing and plucking. Other commonly reported behaviors include holding full conversations with imagined people, finishing a complex, multi-stage action (such as getting dressed) and then suddenly discovering one had not even begun yet, and being unable to recognize one's own reflection in a mirror.\n\nThe effects have been likened to sleepwalking, a fugue state or a psychotic episode (particularly in that the subject has minimal control over their actions and often has little to no recollection of the experience). This is a notable departure from the effects of serotonergic psychedelics.\n\nNaturally-occurring deliriants are found in plant species such as \"Atropa belladonna\" (deadly nightshade), various \"Brugmansia\" species (Angel's Trumpets), \"Datura stramonium\" (Jimson weed), \"Hyoscyamus niger\" (henbane), and \"Mandragora officinarum\" (mandrake) in the form of tropane alkaloids (notably atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine). Synthetic compounds such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) are also deliriants. Nutmeg (although purportedly not as strong or as unpleasant feeling as diphenhydramine or scopolamine) is also considered a deliriant due to its propensity to cause anticholinergic-like symptoms when taken in large doses. These effects are caused by the compounds myristicin and elemicin which are found in nutmeg's essential oil and can last up to several days in their effects similarly to the aforementioned tropane alkaloids found in \"datura\". Additionally, the mushroom referred to as fly agaric and its active principles ibotenic acid and muscimol may also be considered deliriants, albeit more hypnotic and with a unique mechanism of action.\n\nDespite the fully legal status of several common deliriant plants and OTC medicines, deliriants are largely unpopular as recreational drugs due to the severe dysphoria, uncomfortable and generally damaging cognitive and physical effects as well as the sometimes unpleasant nature of the hallucinations produced.\n\nUser reports of recreational deliriant usage on the Erowid website generally indicate a firm unwillingness to repeat the experience. In addition to their potentially dangerous mental effects (accidents during deliriant experiences are common) some tropane alkaloids; such as those found in plants of the Datura genus are poisonous and can cause death due to tachycardia-induced heart failure, hypoventilation and hyperthermia even in small doses. Anticholinergics have also been shown to increase the risk of developing dementia with long-term use even at therapeutic doses, therefore they are presumed to carry an even greater risk when used at hallucinogenic dosages. Scopolamine in particular has been implemented in scientific models used to study the \"cholinergic hypothesis\" for Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.\n\nDeliriants such as henbane, mandrake, Jimson weed and fly agaric are featured in many stories in European mythology.\n\nTropane-based nightshades have also played an integral role in Old World folklore and European witchcraft. Henbane in particular is reputed as having been used in Greco-Roman magic during ancient times as well as being associated with black magic and maleficium during the Late Middle Ages. During this period in medieval Europe, the scopolia carniolica plant was also used as an admixture in love potions. The belladonna plant genus, \"Atropa\" is named after the Greek Fate, Atropos, who cut the thread of life. Mandrake (the root of the \"mandragora officinarum\" plant) is mentioned twice in the Bible, and was also frequently mentioned as a typical ingredient in flying ointment recipes since at least as far back as the Early Modern Period.\n\nTropanes:\n\n\nDisubstituted glycolic acid esters:\n\n\n\n"}

During the period October 1957 to December 1963, it delivered approximately 40,000 megawatt-hours of electricity. This reactor—a light-water moderated and cooled, enriched uranium reactor using stainless steel-clad, plate-type fuel—was a pilot plant and test bed for fuel, core components, controls, and personnel training for the Dresden Nuclear Power Plant, a Commonwealth Edison station built in Illinois five years later.\n\nThe plant was originally a collaborative effort of General Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, with Bechtel Corporation serving as engineering contractor. Samuel Untermyer II, the General Electric engineer responsible for the initial design of the VBWR, had performed much of the conceptual research at Argonne National Laboratory while conducting heat transfer and nuclear physics experiments, including the BORAX experiments. Vallecitos Power Plant held the US Atomic Energy Commission's \"Power Reactor License No. 1\". The main power generating facilities closed in 1963. The discovery of an active fault running beneath the facility led to the closure of its most productive reactors in 1977.\n\nThe Vallecitos site includes the Radioactive Materials Laboratory where post-irradiation examinations are carried out. A small 100-kilowatt research reactor is still in operation at the site. Vallecitos also fabricates radioactive source materials used in medicine and industry, under a license issued by the State of California.\n\n"}

It is the group's 15th overall release.\n\nOn the August 20, 1999, episode of \"The Howard Stern Show\", Insane Clown Posse clashed with fellow guest Sharon Osbourne, when she bet Violent J $50,000 that the group's next album would not sell more than 200,000 copies, and that it would be subsequently dropped from its distributor.\n\n\"Bizaar\" and \"Bizzar\" combined to sell 400,000 units. Following the release of the albums, Insane Clown Posse left Island Records after its contract expired because, according to the group, they did not want to release its through Island Records.\n\nA music video for the song \"Let's Go All the Way\", a cover of a Sly Fox song, was filmed. MTV agreed to play \"Let's Go All the Way\" on their network, airing it once in the late evening. Bruce and Utsler decided to bombard \"Total Request Live\" (\"TRL\") with requests for the video. While on their Bizzar Bizaar Tour, Insane Clown Posse posted on its website that December 8 was the day for their fans to request the video. Bruce and Utsler named that day \"The Mighty Day of Lienda\", meaning \"The Mighty Day of All or Nothing\". On December 8, Rudy Hill, Robert Bruce, Tom Dub, and six other Psychopathic Records employees and friends drove down to New York City. They were met by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans standing outside in front of the \"TRL\" studio window, all with signs supporting the duo. Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from the sidewalk. When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show.

{"id": "1806573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806573", "title": "Aquila (Roman)", "text": "Aquila (Roman)\n\nAn aquila (Latin for \"eagle\") was a prominent symbol used in ancient Rome, especially as the standard of a Roman legion. A legionary known as an \"aquilifer\", the \"eagle-bearer\", carried this standard. Each legion carried one eagle.\n\nThe eagle had a quasi-religious importance to the Roman soldier, far beyond being merely a symbol of his legion. To lose a standard was extremely grave, and the Roman military went to great lengths both to protect a standard and to recover it if it were lost; after the annihilation of three legions in the Teutoburg Forest, the Romans spent decades attempting to recover the three lost eagles.\n\nNo legionary eagles are known to have survived. However, other Roman eagles, either symbolizing imperial rule or used as funerary emblems, have been discovered.\n\nThe \"signa militaria\" were the Roman military ensigns or standards. The most ancient standard employed by the Romans is said to have been a handful (\"manipulus\") of straw fixed to the top of a spear or pole. Hence the company of soldiers belonging to it was called a \"maniple\". The bundle of hay or fern was soon succeeded by the figures of animals, of which Pliny the Elder (\"H.N.\" x.16) enumerates five: the eagle, the wolf, the ox with the man's head, the horse, and the boar. After the devastating Roman defeat at the battle of Arausio against the Cimbri and Teutons the consul Gaius Marius undertook an extensive military reform in 104 BC in which the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle (\"Aquila\") alone being retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.\n\nUnder the later emperors the eagle was carried, as it had been for many centuries, with the legion, a legion being on that account sometimes called \"aquila\" (Hirt. Bell. Hisp. 30). Each cohort had for its own ensign the draco, which was woven on a square piece of cloth \"textilis anguis\", elevated on a gilt staff, to which a cross-bar was adapted for the purpose, and carried by the \"draconarius\".\n\nAnother figure used in the standards was a ball (orb), supposed to have been emblematic of the dominion of Rome over the world; and for the same reason a bronze figure of Victoria was sometimes fixed at the top of the staff, as we see it sculptured, together with small statues of Mars, on the Column of Trajan and the Arch of Constantine. Under the eagle or other emblem was often placed a head of the reigning emperor, which was to the army an object of worship or veneration. The name of the emperor, or of him who was acknowledged as emperor, was sometimes inscribed in the same situation. The pole used to carry the eagle had at its lower extremity an iron point (cuspis) to fix it in the ground, and to enable the aquilifer in case of need to repel an attack.\n\nThe minor divisions of a cohort, called centuries, also each had an ensign, inscribed with the number both of the cohort and of the century. This, together with the diversities of the crests worn by the centurions, enabled each soldier to take his place with ease.\n\nIn the Arch of Constantine at Rome there are four sculptured panels near the top which exhibit a great number of standards and illustrate some of the forms here described. The first panel represents Trajan giving a king to the Parthians: seven standards are held by the soldiers. The second, containing five standards, represents the performance of the sacrifice called suovetaurilia.\n\nWhen Constantine embraced Christianity, a figure or emblem of Christ, woven in gold upon purple cloth, was substituted for the head of the emperor. This richly ornamented standard was called \"labarum\". The labarum is still used today by the Orthodox Church in the Sunday service. The entry procession of the chalice whose contents will soon become holy communion is modeled after the procession of the standards of the Roman army.\nEven after the adoption of Christianity as the Roman Empire's religion; the eagle continued to be used as a symbol by the Holy Roman Empire & the Byzantine Empire. The particularly the Double-Headed Eagle, despite strongly linking back to a Pagan symbol, became very popular among Christians. \n\nSince the movements of a body of troops and of every portion of it were regulated by the standards, all the evolutions, acts, and incidents of the Roman army were expressed by phrases derived from this circumstance. Thus \"signa inferre\" meant to advance, \"referre\" to retreat, and \"convertere\" to face about; \"efferre\", or \"castris vellere\", to march out of the camp; \"ad signa convenire\", to re-assemble. Notwithstanding some obscurity in the use of terms, it appears that, whilst the standard of the legion was properly called \"aquila\", those of the cohorts were in a special sense of the term called \"signa\", their bearers being \"signiferi\", and that those of the manipuli or smaller divisions of the cohort were denominated \"vexilla\", their bearers being \"vexillarii\". Also, those who fought in the first ranks of the legion, in front of the standards of the legion and cohorts, were called \"antesignani\".\n\nIn military stratagems it was sometimes necessary to conceal the standards. Although the Romans commonly considered it a point of honour to preserve their standards, in some cases of extreme danger the leader himself threw them among the ranks of the enemy in order to divert their attention or to animate his own soldiers. A wounded or dying standard-bearer delivered it, if possible, into the hands of his general, from whom he had received it \"signis acceptis\".\n\n\nArch of Constantine showing carvings of \"aquila\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806581", "title": "Dooring", "text": "Dooring\n\nDooring is a traffic collision or crash in which a bicyclist (or other road user) rides into a motor vehicle's door, swerves to avoid or is struck by a door that was opened quickly by an occupant who failed to check carefully for approaching traffic. Proper procedure requires a driver to check the side mirror before opening the door, and/or perform a shoulder check. Use of the 'Dutch Reach' (or 'far hand method') for vehicle egress has been advised to prevent doorings as it combines both measures. The term dooring is also applied when such sudden door opening causes the oncoming rider to swerve to avoid collision, with or without loss of control, crash or secondary collision with another oncoming vehicle. The term also applies when a door is negligently left open, unduly blocking a travel lane. The width of the door zone in which this can happen varies, depending upon the model of car one is passing. The zone can be almost zero for a vehicle with sliding or gull-wing doors or much larger for a truck. Dooring can happen when a driver has parked or stopped to exit their vehicle, or when passengers egress from cars, taxis and rideshares into the path of a cyclist in an adjacent travel lane. In many cities across the globe, doorings are among the most common and injurious bike-vehicle incidents. Notably, any passing vehicle may also strike and damage a negligently opened or left open door, or injure or kill the exiting motorist or passenger.\n\nMany countries are aligned with the Vienna convention which states: \"It shall be prohibited to open the door of a vehicle, to leave it open, or to alight from the vehicle without having made sure that to do so cannot endanger other road-users.\" (Article 24 — Opening of doors).\n\nMost areas have laws that require car users to check for all oncoming traffic including cyclists before opening the door of their vehicle. Some jurisdictions also consider it a traffic code violation if vehicle doors are unnecessarily left open and thus continue to obstruct an adjacent travel lane.\n\nDespite such laws, serious injuries and deaths continue to be caused by occupants opening doors or by bicycle riders riding in the door zone. A 2015 British survey found that 35% of drivers self-reported that they did not check for traffic before opening their vehicle's door to exit.\n\nThe problem lies with avoiding this zone, which should be part of the parking zone, when there is a bike lane or the perception by law enforcement or motorists that one should be riding their bike out of the travel lane to not impede faster motorized traffic. In most jurisdictions, a cyclist is considered a driver/operator of a vehicle afforded the same rights as the driver of a motor vehicle; however, in some jurisdictions cyclists are further restricted by laws such as \"ride as far right [or left] as practicable.\" From a cyclist's point of view, \"practicable\" includes safety, and safety is noted in many of these laws through exceptions; however, many law enforcement, judges, motoring public and even cyclists stop reading at \"as far right.\" Most motor travel lanes adjacent to a bike lane are only wide, so if a cyclist has to use that lane to avoid hazards in the bike lane, it is too narrow to safely share with passing traffic and he/she should ride in a \"lane-control\" method as is allowed by most of these ordinances.\n\nDooring prevention has proven a difficult problem as incidents can occur wherever hinged vehicle doors are carelessly opened and suddenly obstruct travel lanes or sidewalks. Surveys of driver behavior upon egress, in the United Kingdom and the state of Florida, USA, found that 1/3rd and 3/5th's of drivers respectively did not check for oncoming road users before opening.\n\nCyclists are advised to avoid door zones and exercise great caution if in range of open doors from either side when in traffic. Motorists and passengers are advised to exercise heightened caution and vigilance before and during entry or egress from their vehicle. Passengers are advised to exit curb-side only, and never when vehicles are paused in a travel lane.\n\nStreet planners are encouraged to avoid emplacing painted bike lanes in door zones, and to implement instead buffered, separated and/or protected bike lanes and tracks, or shared lane markings. Motor vehicle bureaus and departments of transportation are advised not to restrict vulnerable road users into door zone bike lanes by force of traffic code.\n\nMotor vehicle engineers and manufacturers are deploying new technologies to warn or prevent vehicle occupants from exiting in the presence of oncoming traffic. Auxiliary side view mirrors are now available which fit on B-pillar (car) to assist rear-seated passengers preparing to exit.\n\nRoad safety advocates also call for greater enforcement, fines and penalties, while insurance companies and personal injury attorneys apply sanctions after the fact in the form of increased premiums and liability lawsuits.\n\nImproved training in road sharing by motorists with vulnerable road users is recommended for all road users, done by means of upgraded driver licensing and education standards, curriculum and testing, and public education and behavior change campaigns to improve road safety conduct.\n\nBecause it is rarely possible to see and react safely to a suddenly opening door, traffic cycling educational programs teach cyclists to ride in the safe zone or travel lane well outside the door zone as measured from the tip of the handlebars.\n\nAs street planners often lay out painted bike lanes in the door zone, many bicycle safety advocates advise cyclists to maintain a safe distance from car doors nonetheless and disregard such markings to do so. However riding on the margin of the bike lane places a cyclist in increased proximity to overtaking vehicles and also at risk of being squeezed closer into the doorzone. Other advocates therefore instruct bicyclists to take control of the full travel lane to avoid dooring, considering it the safest position overall.\n\nAlso to avoid doorings, bicyclists are advised to exercise vigilance, scan for the presence or likelihood of an occupied parked or stopped vehicle. Risk is increased especially in areas and at times of high parking turnover, on main arteries, during morning and evening commutes, and in retail, restaurant and entertainment districts with parallel parking. Bicyclists are also advised to assure their visibility to motorists & in mirrors both day and night by the use of bright and reflective clothing, vests, reflectors and front lights. Marked caution, slow speed and preparedness to brake when in the door zone are also counselled.\n\nMotorists and passengers - both front and rear - may be able to make dooring less likely by practicing the \"Dutch Reach\" - opening the car door by reaching across the body with the more distant hand which promotes a shoulder check - out and back - to scan for cyclists and other oncoming traffic.\n\nReaching across turns one's upper body and head outward. It encourages drivers and front passengers to use the side wing mirror, look out to the side and then over one's shoulder to scan for traffic before opening. Once the door is partly opened, as one leans out one's over-the-shoulder view is now clear, no longer limited by side pillar (car) or door frame. As a further safe-guard against dooring, reaching across curbs wide, sudden opening.\n\nEven as the maneuver is becoming known elsewhere as the \"Dutch Reach\", in the Netherlands driving instructors and driving school companies refer to it by description and not by a name. The far hand move is not literally specified by Dutch traffic code to pass the safe parking section of the road test. Rather, Dutch regulations for licensing set two standards to ensure safe exiting of vehicles to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs), viz: Articles 4e and 6a. \nAs fewer than half of Dutch license applicants pass the examination on first attempt, some but not all Dutch driving instructors and texts for the theory examination teach the far hand maneuver as most assured to demonstrate safe exiting on both the written and road tests. That said, alternative exiting measures may also suffice in modern, bicycle friendly Netherlands. But evidence for such left or near hand instruction awaits documentation.\n\nThe reach method is likely less practiced by Dutch motorists today than in the 1960s-1980s when Dutch road fatalities numbered in the thousands and prompted the Stop the Kindermoord protest movement to end the carnage. Anecdotal reports date the 'reach across' practice to that era. But public awareness of the method in the Netherlands extends at least back to 1961. \nSince then bicycling in the Netherlands is much safer. Innovative and extensive infrastructure improvements, separate and protected cycle tracks, strict driver education and testing, popular use of bicycles for daily transport and dedication to road safety, all contributed to its dramatic decline in road injuries and fatalities. Yet dooring injuries and even fatalities in the Netherlands still occur, and the far hand method is still taught, though public awareness of it and its practice in the Netherlands has waned.\n\nAs noted above, the far hand technique does not have a Dutch name, but in 2016 an American physician in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, coined the term to promote the Dutch method which was little known in the United States. \nThe “Dutch Reach” coinage reflects that the method was common to the Netherlands before being 'imported' to the U.S. It was described as a Dutch road safety measure in the American mainstream press in 2011 by the New York Times and the Boston Globe in 2013.\n\nThe method can be traced beyond northern Europe starting in the 2010s. From 2011 to 2016 several bicycle advocacy organizations and road safety agencies in the United States, Canada and Australia added advisories or launched anti-dooring campaigns which included or featured the far hand countermeasure. In New Haven, CT it was variously called the \"Amsterdam\", \"European cities’\" or “reach-across” method (2013). In Fort Collins, CO it became the “Opposite Hand Trick” (2014). However the tip remained nameless in San Francisco, CA (2015); Montreal (2014), and Vancouver (2016), Canada; New Zealand (2015); and Victoria, Australia (2012). In Australia two slogans have emerged to prompt the habit: \"Lead with your left\" [origin uncertain]; and \"Always Cross Check\", devised by a road safety organization. [Note: Drivers in left hand drive countries 'lead with left' to reach across.]\n\nIn early 2017 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (UK) endorsed the Dutch Reach as the recommended road safety practice to avoid dooring collisions. In 2019, the National Safety Council (U.S.) and American Automobile Association began including the far hand reach in their respective defensive driving and novice driver course materials and road safety programs. National, state and local bicycle and pedestrian advocacy organizations have played an important part in promoting the measure. These include: We Are Cycling UK; League of American Bicyclists; Bicycle Network (AUS); Cycling Action Network (NZ); New York Bicycle Coalition; Bicycle Friendly Driver Program of Fort Collins, CO; MassBike and Somerville Bicycle Committee.\n\nOther governments are now adding the 'reach' to driver's manuals and education, taxi and for-hire ridesharing regulations, and road safety campaigns. Examples include: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of Illinois, State of Washington, State of Pennsylvania, South Australia, Washington D.C., City of London Corporation, Berlin, Germany, NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, Cambridge, MA, USA, and Burbank, CA. In 2018 the British transportation network company (TNC) Addison Lee launched its own anti-dooring far hand reach campaign branding it 'the Addison Lean'. In April 2019 Lyft, a U.S. TNC implemented automatic wikt: in-app push notifications to prompt its drivers and clients in 22 U.S. cities to use the Dutch Reach when exiting. Uber followed one month later with a pilot Dutch Reach education program for its users & drivers in four North American cities. Some police departments, hospitals, motor vehicle insurance companies, transportation management companies and personal injury law firms have also begun promoting the method.\n\nUntil 2018, the scientific safety literature had been silent on the relative merits or flaws of near hand versus far hand egress from vehicles. However a human factors research paper \"Validating the Dutch Reach\" presented at the 7th International Cycling Safety Conference in October 2018, found initial evidence for its safety advantage. In 2019 British automaker Aston Martin introduced a reversed door latch lever in its Vantage sports car whose ergonomic design strongly favors far-hand use for opening while making the near hand habit awkward.\n\nSeveral automakers & automotive technology companies have introduced or are now developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to help prevent doorings. Technologies include use of external onboard cameras and sensors, seat buckles, or GPS data, computer recognition software etc. linked to sound or light signals or door operation to alert or warn drivers and/or cyclists, or forestall door opening.\n\nAt least one auto-parts supplier has developed an automatic detection system to prevent or warn the user before opening the car door if a bicycle is approaching.\n\n It is difficult to find statistics on the incidence of door zone fatalities, serious injuries, and collisions as the type of accident is often not recorded consistently from city to city. However, an analysis of Chicago bike crashes found that there were 344 reported dooring crashes reported in 2011, for a rate of 0.94 doorings per day. Doorings made up 19.7% of all reported bike crashes. The number of additional doorings that occurred without being reported is unknown. In 2016, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency reported that for the period 2012-2015, doorings of bicyclists constituted 18% of injurious or fatal bike-vehicle incidents in which the cyclist was likely not at fault. A 2015 study for the City of Vancouver, British Columbia found that doorings accounted for 15.2% of all bike collisions and was the foremost cause of bike-vehicle collision injuries which resulted in hospital emergency department treatment (22%) - not including additional injury incidents due to dooring avoidant swerve crashes requiring emergency treatment.\n\nIn Toronto, \"motorist opens door in path of cyclist\" collisions were 11.9% of all reported car/bike collisions in 2003. Eight percent of serious injuries to cyclists in London in 2007 were caused by cyclists swerving to avoid opening car doors. In the Australian state of Victoria between 2006 and 2010, car door openings caused eight percent of serious injuries to cyclists.\n\nRelative to other collisions such as getting rear ended, getting doored is less risky: \"80.04% of those cyclists who were doored were injured, while 94.40% of those in non-dooring crashes were injured.\" Also, getting doored itself usually is not fatal; rather, most serious door-zone-related injuries are sustained by getting hit by a motor vehicle after colliding with or swerving to avoid the obstructing door. Thus, most dooring deaths and serious injuries occur in the travel lane and not in the door zone.\n\nAs with other dooring statistics, even fatalities are often under-reported as, for example, secondary collisions after door avoidant swerves may not be recognized by authorities, the media, witnesses or perpetrators as due to a dooring incident. Also, in some jurisdictions, dooring is not officially considered a motor vehicle collision if the vehicle is parked. Informal logs of dooring fatalities based on found media reports have been maintained on the internet. An annotated, international memorial spreadsheet with entries from 1987 to the present is currently maintained by an American cycling safety advocate.\n\nIn New York City, 3% (7 out of 225) of bicyclist fatalities in the ten-year period between 1996 and 2005 were from striking an open door or swerving to avoid one. In London three people were killed in car door opening incidents between 2010 and 2012. In two peer reviewed studies, 124 deaths in London during 1985-1992, \nand 142 deaths in New Zealand during 1973-1978, none of the fatalities occurred in door opening incidents. While there were 1112 collisions caused by opening doors in the Australian state of Victoria between 2000 and 2010, the first fatality occurred in March 2010.\n\nIn a comparison of Santa Barbara (without bike lanes) to Davis, California (with bike lanes), 8% of the car-bike collisions in Santa Barbara involved an opening door, whereas Davis had none.\n\n\n"}

The background is white, with the red Maple Leaf of the Flag of Canada near the centre of the otherwise void area.\n\nThe flag was officially dedicated on August 19, 1969, by then-Mayor Albert Campbell at a special ceremony in Thomson Memorial Park. It was designed by local painter Doris McCarthy (1910–2010) in the spring of 1968, who was presented with the idea by her friend Albert Campbell.\nMcCarthy based the design on ideas presented by Campbell and likely from her influence in living by the Bluffs.\n\nThe need for the flag was proposed by Campbell to give the new borough an identity at civic events. The flag was used at the Scarborough Civic Centre, municipal buildings and schools of the Scarborough Board of Education.\n\nScarborough was one of three municipalities within Metropolitan Toronto to introduce a civic flag:\n\n\nThe City of York, City of North York and Borough of East York used corporate slogan civic logo or motto as a banner instead of an official flag.\n\nAfter the 1998 amalgamation of Toronto, the official use of civic symbols from the former municipalities was no longer legally valid and the Scarborough flag was no longer flown on municipal buildings. In early January 2004, Toronto City councilors Brian Ashton and Glenn De Baeremaeker argued at the newly established Scarborough Community Council for the re-establishment of the Scarborough flag as a symbol of the borough. On January 27, 2004, Toronto City Council granted a Scarborough Community Council request to be allowed to fly the former City of Scarborough flag. In early January 2008, De Baermaeker spoke up about a lack of funding for civic symbols, saying it would only cost \"$5,000 to buy 100 Scarborough flags to put in front of our civic buildings.\" On January 29 and 30, 2008, Toronto City Council authorized the allocation of $20,000 to order Scarborough flags to be used for municipal and civic purposes by the City and local City Councillors.\n\n"}

He played college football at Maryland and was drafted 12th overall by the San Diego Chargers in the 2005 NFL Draft. He earned NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year honors in his first season and recorded quarterback sacks in his first three seasons, also making three Pro Bowls as well as two All-Pro selections. He was hampered by injuries his next three seasons, and the Chargers waived Merriman midseason in 2010. He was acquired through waivers by the Buffalo Bills that season, but he only played minimally with the Bills due to continued injuries. He was released by the Bills before the 2012 season before they re-signed him mid-season.\n\nMerriman grew up in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. He earned his nickname \"Lights Out\" at Frederick Douglass High School, where he rendered four opposing players unconscious in one game, three in the first half and one in the second half.\n\nMerriman started three years on both the varsity football and basketball teams. On the hardwood, Merriman was named one of the top five basketball defenders in the D.C. area by \"The Washington Post\". For his football performance during his senior year, he was selected to the first team all-state and named Maryland Defensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. He also played some tight end in high school.\n\nDespite being heavily recruited, Merriman stayed in-state for college and attended the University of Maryland, where he played for the Maryland Terrapins football team. During his freshman campaign in 2002, Merriman appeared in 13 games and finished third on the team with 5 sacks.\n\nHe battled injuries for the bulk of his sophomore season, but never missed a game. He broke onto the national scene his junior year, in which he was named to the ACC All-Conference team and earned the Iron Terp award for the \"strongest pound for pound player\" on the Maryland football roster.\n\nHis 41.5\" vertical jump in 2003 was the best ever by a Maryland defensive lineman to that point.\n\nMerriman was drafted in the 1st round (12th overall) in the 2005 NFL Draft out of the University of Maryland by the San Diego Chargers. He was selected using a pick acquired from the New York Giants as part of the Rivers-Manning trade during the 2004 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Giants traded Philip Rivers (selected 4th overall in the 2004 Draft), and their 1st round selection for the following year (amongst others) for the rights to sign Eli Manning, who had been selected by the San Diego Chargers with the 1st overall pick that year. Manning had made it clear he was not interested in playing for the Chargers, in a similar fashion to John Elway in 1983 when selected by the Baltimore Colts.\n\nThe Giants draft pick ended up being the 12th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. The Chargers used that selection to take Merriman.\n\nOn August 1, after a long holdout period, Merriman signed a 5-year, $11.5 million contract that included $9 million in guarantees and $4 million in incentives.\n\nMerriman started off his 2005 rookie year on the inactive list and completed a 10-day hold out from training camp. He did not break the starting lineup until week 7, but recorded 6 sacks in his first 4 starts. He was voted into the Pro Bowl as an OLB after playing the position for the San Diego Chargers in their 3–4 defensive scheme which is the same position he played at the University of Maryland. Merriman's best game of the year came in week 15 when the Chargers handed the Indianapolis Colts their first loss of the season. Merriman recorded 2 sacks and 2 tackles for a loss, one of which stopped Peyton Manning for a 6-yard loss on 4th and goal. It was during this game that Shawne Merriman garnered much national media coverage and in the following week made the Pro Bowl.\n\nThe Chargers would go 9–7 in 2005, taking down both the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots and the 14–0 Indianapolis Colts\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Merriman was awarded with The Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year award. He received 28 votes of a panel of 50 NFL sportswriters and broadcasters. He beat Seattle Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu, who received 16 votes, Cincinnati linebacker Odell Thurman, with 4, and Dallas linebacker DeMarcus Ware, with one. On February 12, 2006, Merriman participated in the 2006 NFL Pro Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii. Although in a losing effort, Merriman made 3 tackles and forced one fumble. \"I enjoyed myself the whole entire week\", said Merriman. \"I topped it off today by playing the entire game with all the guys I grew up watching. It's going to be my first of many if I just keep working hard.\"\n\nOn October 22, 2006, reports were made public by CNN that Merriman would face a 4-game suspension for violating the NFL's steroid policy. ESPN's Chris Mortensen cited a source that claimed the suspension was \"definitely for steroid use and not a 'supplement-type' suspension.\" Mortenson's report later came under scrutiny from Merriman's attorney, David Cornwell, who called the report \"irresponsible and erroneous.\" Under NFL league policy, no player's suspension proceedings are to be announced before the suspension takes place. Subsequently, Cornwell stated that he believed the substance his client tested positive for was the anabolic steroid nandrolone, and that Merriman claimed it must have been in a tainted nutritional supplement he took regularly. Merriman never identified the supplement.\n\nThe incident led to the passage of a rule that forbids a player who tests positive for steroids from being selected to the Pro Bowl or winning any performance awards in the year in which they tested positive. The rule is commonly referred as the \"Merriman Rule\". However, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has tried to distance the policy from being associated with the player, stating that Merriman tested clean on 19 of 20 random tests for performance-enhancing drugs since entering the league.\n\nAt the start of his 2006 season after the 4-game suspension, Merriman again began his season with success, recording 3 sacks and an interception in his first 2 games. Merriman went on to record 8.5 sacks and make ESPN's midseason All-pro team, prior to dropping an appeal against an NFL enforced 4-week suspension due to testing positive for steroids. In the 2006 regular season, Merriman led the league in sacks with 17 while playing only 12 games. He also added 4 forced fumbles to his career (2 against both the Buffalo Bills and the Denver Broncos). Merriman finished third in the balloting for 2006 Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year, behind Jason Taylor and Champ Bailey, after having tested positive for using steroids which is against the league's drug abuse policy. Taylor commented that Merriman should not have been considered for the award because of his suspension. Merriman reportedly responded by sending Taylor a \"Lights Out\" t-shirt and a box of popcorn with a note saying enjoy watching him in the playoffs. Merriman, nicknamed \"Lights Out\", performed a dance to celebrate each of his 17 sacks in 2006–2009. After the Chargers were eliminated in the playoffs by the New England Patriots that season, members of the Patriots began performing Merriman's \"Lights Out\" dance on the field in celebration. Merriman's Chargers teammate LaDainian Tomlinson, referred to the act as showing no class and being disrespectful.\n\nIn 2007, he announced that he would no longer perform this celebration. In week 4, however, Merriman performed the dance after sacking Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Damon Huard. After the Chargers' slow 1-3 start to the season, Merriman exclaimed that he decided to do the sack dance again due to the urge of his teammates and to help revive the spirits of the Charger fans.\n\nMerriman finished the season with 68 total tackles, with 54 solo and 14 assisted tackles, performing to his usual caliber by tallying 12.5 sacks. His prowess was shown during the season when it was said that his 9.5 sacks through to week 13 was seen as a decline in performance, a quote to which Merriman took a great compliment. The Chargers finished the season with a loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.\n\nMerriman was named to the Pro Bowl for a third consecutive year. At that point had a total of 39.5 sacks in three seasons. His 39.5 sacks are the most for any player from 2005 to 2007, edging out Jason Taylor by just one full sack. He had also been named First-Team All-Pro in his first 2 seasons, while earning a Second-Team All-Pro selection in his 3rd season.\n\nDuring the 2008 training camp, Merriman had difficulty with his injured knee and sat out of practice for over two weeks. Initial reports were that his recovery would take a few weeks, but on August 23, Merriman reported that he had a tear in both his posterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament. He was told by doctors that he could sustain a possible career-threatening injury should he choose to play without having surgery. Merriman withheld his decision whether or not to play while seeking several different professional opinions, including that of well-known surgeon James Andrews of Birmingham, Alabama. ESPN's Mike Tirico reported in the Chargers' Monday Night Football game that Merriman went to Miami, Florida to get a final opinion on his knee. On August 27, Merriman told Fox Sports that he would go against the advice of the doctors and will try to play through the injury, stating that he simply wants to play and that the career-ending possibilities were \"misquoted.\"\n\nOn September 9, it was announced that Merriman would indeed go through with the reconstructive knee surgery to repair his torn knee ligaments and would be placed on the Injured Reserve, missing the rest of the 2008 NFL Season.\n\nIn the 2009 season, Merriman was suffering from a painful foot injury as well as his troubled knees. He had only four sacks for the season.\n\nAt the beginning of the calendar year, Merriman expressed concern that the Chargers may no longer want him, but said that his goal was to remain a Charger if possible. On March 4, 2010, the San Diego Chargers announced that they would place their first and third round franchise tender on Merriman, thus retaining him as a Charger. On August 13, 2010, after two weeks of hold out, Shawne Merriman signed tender and reported to camp.\n\nOn October 13, the Chargers announced that Merriman was being placed on injured reserve and, per NFL rules, would be released when he became healthy. Merriman had re-injured his calf against Oakland and had been limited in the first five weeks of the season. Merriman was put on waivers by the Chargers on November 2, 2010. He had only four sacks in his last three seasons in San Diego.\n\nMerriman was claimed off waivers by the Buffalo Bills the day after his release from the Chargers.\n\nOn November 10, Merriman suffered an Achilles injury during his first workout with his new team. Subsequently, on November 27, the Bills placed Merriman on season-ending injury reserve.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract extension worth $10.5 million with the Bills on January 1, 2011. The deal contained $5 million guaranteed, including $3 million of his 2012 salary.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, Merriman was placed on Injured Reserve list for the second consecutive season after suffering a partially torn Achilles tendon. Merriman finished the season with nine tackles and a sack in five starts. During the 2012 offseason, Merriman was moved from outside linebacker to defensive end due to the switch of 3–4 to 4–3. On August 20, the team released Merriman.\n\nMerriman signed a contract to return to the Bills on October 15, 2012.\n\nOn March 5, 2013, Merriman announced his retirement.\n\nKey\n\nOn September 6, 2009 Merriman was arrested and charged with battery and false imprisonment. Merriman's former girlfriend, reality TV star Tila Tequila, claimed in an arrest complaint that he choked and restrained her when she tried to leave his home. The charges were dismissed less than a week later on September 11, 2009.\n\nIn December 2009, Merriman filed a civil suit against Tequila, alleging intentional interference with contract, unfair competition, and trademark infringement. He claimed that Tequila improperly used his own \"Lights Out\" logo and disrupted negotiations for T-shirts to be marketed by Wal-Mart. She failed to respond to the suit at all, and a default judgment was entered in his favor for $2 million. However, the default judgment was later set aside in January 2010. In February 2010, both sides jointly moved the court to dismiss the claim, and the court dismissed the case on the same day. \n\nIn July 2019, he was accused of drugging and raping Kimberly Fattorini, a Playboy employee, who later died. \n\nMerriman was featured on an episode of \"MTV Exposed\". On October 10, 2007, Merriman was chosen as the cover athlete for EA Sports' \"NFL Tour\" video game. Merriman appears in Keri Hilson's \"Knock You Down\" music video and made a special appearance at WWE's One Night Stand 2008 on June 1, 2008, where he hit superstar Chavo Guerrero with a Singapore Cane. He returned to WWE as a Wrestlemania XXX pre-show analyst on April 6, 2014 and again the following night on \"Monday Night RAW\"'s pre- and post-show on the WWE Network.\n\nMerriman is featured in the Nike football \"Leave Nothing\" advertisement. Merriman made a cameo in season 7 of HBO's \"Entourage\". Merriman also appeared on Cartoon Network's \"Destroy Build Destroy\" along with Antonio Gates. Merriman appeared on GNC's Athlete Tour 2010 under his MusclePharm sponsorship. Merriman appeared on WGR Sports Radio 550's \"Schopp and the Bulldog\" in Buffalo, New York on July 27, 2012. He visited the show's studio at Bills' training camp in Rochester, New York.\n\nHe showed off his tattoos in PETA's \"Ink Not Mink\" campaign, encouraging people not to wear animal furs.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared on MTV's \"\", playing for his charity, the Lights On Foundation.\n\nIn 2018, he appeared as a guest on the popular sports and comedy podcast The Dirty Sports Podcast hosted by comedians Andy Ruther and Joe Praino. He also appeared on FS1 as an NFL analyst.\n\nIn April 2014, Merriman appeared on the pre-show of WrestleMania XXX. Shortly after, it was reported on \"The JBL & Cole Show\" that Merriman had \"joined the WWE family\" and would report to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. On August 27, reports surfaced indicating Merriman was no longer contracted to WWE.\n\nIn January 2015, Japanese martial arts event \"GANRYUJIMA\" announced that they were negotiating with Merriman for him to be a fighter, but they were unable to reach an agreement.\n\nIn 2017, Merriman partnered with NASCAR K&N Pro Series West driver and Naval officer Jesse Iwuji, serving as the owner of Iwuji's No. 36 car. The two met during a fashion show in Los Angeles promoting Merriman's new clothing line, \"Lights Out\"; Merriman, a longtime motorsports fan, agreed to join Iwuji's Patriot Motorsports Group team.\n\nIn August 2018, Merriman signed with the World Bare Knuckle Fighting Federation to appear in a fight later that year. Merriman was expected to face Mike Bourke in the inaugural WBKFF event on November 9, 2018. According to promotion's president Bas Rutten, Wyoming athletic commission had suspicions that Bourke's previous fight in Romania was fixed and – him being from the same management team than Merriman – the commission would not license him to fight. In addition, Merriman and WBKFF had contract pay dispute and after the promotion allegedly agreed to pay the contracted sum, Merriman's management team wouldn't agree. The promotion eventually refused to pay Merriman for \"not\" fighting, as his management demanded, leading Merriman to withdraw from the bout.\n\nIn April 2019, Merriman announced that he is starting his own MMA promotion, Lights Out Xtreme Fighting, which is expected to have its inaugural event on May 11, 2019.\n\n"}

They are primarily used today as sport cattle for rodeo events such as team roping and bulldogging (steer wrestling). Some breeders raise them for their meat, which contains approximately half the fat of the meat from most modern beef cattle.\n\nCorrientes are fairly small cattle, with cows averaging well under 1,000 pounds (450 kg). They are lean, athletic, and have long upcurving horns. They are known as \"easy keepers,\" as little human intervention is required in their calving, and they eat significantly less than larger beef cattle breeds. Like other Criollo breeds, the corriente require less water and can live on sparse open range. Corrientes are also known as accomplished escape artists, as they can leap a standard barbed-wire fence and squeeze through fairly small openings.\nNames for the breed differ. The official breed registry in the United States calls them Corriente cattle, which is the most common term in Northern Mexico. In other parts of Mexico, they are called \"Criollo\" or \"Chinampo\" cattle. They are closely related to Pineywoods and Florida Cracker cattle, two breeds from the Gulf Coast and Florida.\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Oklahoma, and received unanimous All-American recognition, and was chosen by the New Orleans Saints in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown was selected for the Pro Bowl twice and won Super Bowl XLIV with the team. He also played for the Washington Redskins.\n\nBrown was born in Waxahachie, Texas. He attended MacArthur High School in Lawton, Oklahoma and was a letterman in football in the defensive lineman position. As a senior, he won all-state honors as a defensive lineman. He graduated from MacArthur High School in 2000.\n\nBrown attended the University of Oklahoma, where he played for coach Bob Stoops's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 2000 to 2004. He had been recruited as a defensive tackle, but was switched to offensive tackle in his sophomore year, and quickly blossomed, and secured a starting spot on the Sooners' offensive line. As a senior in 2004, he won the Outland Trophy as the nation's most outstanding lineman. He was the anchor of an offensive line that paved the way for Adrian Peterson to set the record for most rushing yardage by a freshman in 2004. His contributions were key to the Sooners winning the 2004 Big 12 Championship. He was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2003 and 2004, he was an All-American in 2003 and a unanimous first-team All-American in 2004.\n\nBrown was regarded as one of the best offensive tackles available in the 2005 NFL Draft, and drew comparisons to Jordan Gross. He was selected by the New Orleans Saints with the 13th overall pick. Brown was the first Sooner offensive lineman taken in the draft since Stockar McDougle went to the Detroit Lions as the 20th overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. Remarkably, Brown was the highest selection among OU offensive lineman since Stan West was the No. 8 pick by the Los Angeles Rams in 1950.\n\nHe was selected to attend the 2006 Pro Bowl alongside the player he protects, quarterback Drew Brees, after anchoring the line that got the Saints to the NFC Championship Game. Brown's prototypical size at left tackle makes him good at both run and pass blocking. He led the league in rushing average behind left tackle while only allowing 3 sacks. He was again selected with Brees to participate in the 2008 Pro Bowl.\n\nA torn ACL kept Brown out of action in 2009. The emergence of Jermon Bushrod in his absence resulted in him losing his starting job and an eventual trade to the Washington Redskins.\n\nBrown was traded to the Washington Redskins on June 19, 2010 for a third or a fourth round pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, depending on which pick is sent to the Eagles as a part of the trade for quarterback, Donovan McNabb. The pick was used to select Martez Wilson.\nBrown was made the starting right tackle of the offensive line. At the end of 2010 season, he played in 15 games and started 14 of them.\n\nOn July 31, 2011, the Redskins re-signed Brown to a five-year, $20.25 million contract.\nAs with the 2010 season, he was hampered by the hip surgery he received in 2009.\nIn Week 15 of the 2011 season against the New England Patriots, he suffered a groin injury during pre-game warmups and was replaced by Tyler Polumbus.\nAt the end of the 2011 season, Brown played and started a total of 12 games.\n\nAt the start of 2012 training camp, Brown was placed on the physically unable to perform list due to hip soreness on July 26, 2012. Despite initial reports saying he would not need to undergo surgery, Brown had hip surgery on August 27 and expected to miss four to six weeks while recovering. By the start of the 2012 season, he was kept on the PUP list meaning he would not be allowed to play in the first six games of the season. On November 28, the Redskins decided to leave him on the season-ending PUP list. Due to how Brown's contract was restructured last season, the last three years on his contract became void on February 8, 2013, which set him up to become an unrestricted free agent for 2013 season.\n\n"}

He has been called \"the premier Matthew specialist of his generation in the United States\" and \"North America's most complete New Testament scholar.\" Allison has served on many editorial boards including \"New Testament Studies\" and the \"Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus\" and he was for many years the main New Testament editor for the multi-volume \"Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception.\" He contributed the commentary on the Gospel of Matthew to the single-volume \"Oxford Bible Commentary\", published in 2001.\n\nAllison is a prominent defender of the view of the historical Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet expecting the imminent end of the age. This view is laid out in his books \"Jesus of Nazareth: Millenarian Prophet\" and \"Constructing Jesus: Memory and Imagination and History\" (which the Biblical Archaeology Society named best book relating the New Testament for 2009-2010). This view stands over against those of the Jesus Seminar and such scholars as John Dominic Crossan and Marcus Borg, whose reconstructions of Jesus are largely free of apocalyptic elements. In recent years, he has been a critic of the standard scholarly means of authenticating sayings attributed to Jesus and events concerning him, and he has proposed an alternative approach that takes into account the modern scientific work on human memory.We can, nonetheless, make numerous informed judgments—for instance, that the Romans crucified Jesus as “king of the Jews”—and we can, happily, judge many propositions more probable than others. It is, for example, much more credible that Jesus was a millenarian prophet than that the eschatological enthusiasm reflected in so many early Christian texts appeared independently of his influence. Still, a vast ignorance remains, and our reach often exceeds our grasp. Time after time, if we are honest, arguments concocted to demonstrate that Jesus really did say this or really did do that fall flat. Historians of Jesus, including myself, have too often assumed that we should be able, with sufficient ingenuity, to reconstruct the genealogy of almost every individual tradition. But it is not so. Some things just cannot be done, and desire does not beget ability.\n\n\n"}

Blake has been inducted into both the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame and is a medal recipient from the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival for his first film NIGHT TRIPS.\n\nAndrew Blake began his career working on movies for Playboy, and then for Penthouse but shifted to working independently in the 1990s. Most of Blake's films are released through his own production company, Studio A Entertainment. Andrew Blake is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame (200?) and XRCO Hall of Fame (2003). Blake's films usually feature original music scores by the composer Raoul Valve.\n\nBlake has described his work as \"erotic fashion,\" and his films usually include fetish, bondage, and lesbian imagery, often excluding heterosexual intercourse entirely. Blake's earliest films were primarily works of softcore erotica, however, and that sensibility still informs his pacing and style. Early films made by Blake soon after he came into his own as an independent director are fully explicit and usually combine heterosexual intercourse with lesbian imagery while including much less fetish and bondage content than his later films.\n\nAn interview with Blake is included in the \"9 to 5 – Days in Porn\" (2009) documentary film about the American porn industry.\n\nBlake's first major film, \"Night Trips,\" (1989), was awarded the Silver Medal in the Non-Theatrical Release Category at the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival. Andrew Blake holds the distinction of being the first adult director to win a film award at a mainstream international film festival.\n\nAndrew Blake's films are characterized by high production values, artistic stylization, and rigorous technique. His style has been compared to that of the seminal fashion photographer Helmut Newton, and described as \"decadent, lush, opulent, unfailingly arousing, moneyed and sophisticated.\"\n\nSex writer Violet Blue says of Blake's work: \"It's a whole different genre of explicit erotic filmmaking evident from the first frame -- pure high fashion, glossy candyland fantasy. It is luxuriously designed from nip tip to toe. And it's stylish as hell.\"\n\nAndrew Blake has had a significant impact on pop film culture. Blake was the first adult director to win a crossover award with Night Trips filmed in 1989, which won the Silver Award Non-Theatrical Release at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. Blake featured Dita Von Tease in a full-length feature film Corsets & Upskirts, which featured her as a pinup and highlighted her interest in the fetish and kink lifestyle further elevating her career as the world leading fetish burlesque star. Blake has been on the forefront of pop culture embracing technology, such as the early adoption of Twitter in 2011, and helped usher film based cinematography into the digital era. Transferring his films to high-definition digital versions, Blake set the standard for high definition erotica.\n\nThe following listing includes directors also known for adult erotic films:\n\n"}

Having previously created and released three homemade \"basement tapes\" (distributed locally and highly sought-after by collectors today) that were recorded on cassette via karaoke machine (\"Enter the Ghetto Zone\", \"Intelligence and Violence\", and \"Bass-ment Cuts\"), Dog Beats was both the Inner City Posse's first release to be recorded professionally and was also the first record ever released by Psychopathic Records.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Joseph Bruce, Joseph Utsler and Utsler's brother, John, performed at local night clubs, using the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse. Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother Robert recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the Psychopathic Records record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced EP entitled \"Dog Beats\". Growing popularity in the local music scene turned negative for the group's gang, which became the target of growing violence. After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.\n\n\"Dog Beats\" began recording at Miller Midi Productions in Detroit, Michigan with Chuck Miller producing and mastering the album. This album features samples of other artists lyrics and songs. \"Life at Risk\" uses a sample from The Wiz's \"What Would I Do If I Could Feel?\" and contains some lyrics from the Ice Cube track \"Who's the Mack?\". The title track uses a looped sample from the George Clinton's song \"Atomic Dog\" as its bassline and refrain. \"Ghetto Zone\" uses a sample from Rod Stewart's Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?.\n\nMiller produced each track very slowly, and after long periods of studio time and much money spent, the group had their first song produced, \"Ghetto Zone\". Bruce later called Miller a \"snake\". While Miller would begin working on the group's first full-length studio album as Insane Clown Posse, \"Carnival of Carnage\", he was later replaced by Mike E. Clark, following a managerial decision by Alex Abbiss.\n\nJoseph Bruce samples several clips from the film \"The Wizard of Oz\" in \"Wizard of the Hood.\" The song was originally written by Bruce sometime in the late 1980s. The first recorded version of the song appeared on the \"Intelligence and Violence\" EP under the name \"Wizard of Delray.\"\n\nFor the cover, Bruce had his friend, Don, hang from a rope in Delray dressed as a clown. Don would later perform with ICP in their early days as a hype man, but after an embarrassing concert at Ferris State University, and tired of being just a hype man, he decided to quit the group. Joseph Utsler drew a jester marionette holding up the \"ICP\" logo. Inner City Posse wanted the artwork to have typesetting and presentation that looked professional, so Alex Abbiss hired a graphic designer to process the materials, which included a photograph of the group, into a cover. The designer told them that he had to charge them 50 cents more than the usual fee for every typesetting that was larger than the standard type; the designer attempted to charge them a $10 fee for the explicit lyrics box, which would have featured white letters over a black background. As the designer continued to describe the fees the group would be charged, they realized that they were being ripped off.\n\n\"Dog Beats\" was Psychopathic Records' first release; Bruce wanted the album to be \"available everywhere\" because people would not expect a local act to be as widely released. This sales method did not turn out as planned, as the album was mostly released locally, and was not purchased by as many stores as Bruce had hoped. The group members took turns going out with unattractive women who worked at Kinkos in exchange for having their fliers promoting the album printed for free. The group promoted the album themselves by putting up the fliers across the city.\n\nWhile promoting the album, Bruce and William Dail drove up to a young African American man and Bruce asked him if he liked rap music. The kid, who appeared scared, told him \"no\". Bruce, still determined, told him that if he knew someone who did, he could \"give them this\" and threw a cassette copy of \"Dog Beats\" on the ground. As Bruce and Dail began to drive away, their back windows were shot out and they looked behind them to find that the kid had pulled out a gun and shot out their windows.\n\nLater, Bruce was putting fliers on the windows of cars in the parking lot of the heavy metal club Harpo's, and was hassled by a security guard, who told him that Bruce couldn't put up fliers unless it was for a performance at the club. Bruce apologized, but the security guard insisted that Bruce go back and take every flier off of every car. As he left with his fliers, the guard pulled him over and asked what he had. Bruce explained, \"I'm in ICP, we're a rap group\" and the security guard responded by punching him in the face so hard that Bruce's nose has been crooked ever since.\n\nInsane Clown Posse were asked to perform at Ferris State University in promotion of the EP. A snowstorm delayed the group's performance, and because there were no microphones, the performance consisted of Bruce and Utsler \"yelling over [their] own cassette\". After they finished their two-song set, Bruce stated that the audience \"didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned.\" Bruce and Utsler later learned that the actual concert had taken place on the other side of the college three hours earlier, but decided that the mishap \"wasn't even close to slowing [their careers] down.\"\n\nAbbiss actively sought out local airplay for Inner City Posse, but radio broadcasters were reluctant to play the single \"Dog Beats\" once they learned that the members were white. While trying to get stations to play the single, Bruce learned that one of the stations he and Abbiss visited would be interviewing local rapper Esham, who Bruce considered to be a \"superstar\"; Bruce had recently begun to collect Esham's albums, as he had done with other local rappers; by the time he had discovered Esham, the rapper had released two full-length albums and three EPs. Bruce met Esham for the first time at the station and appraised him. Esham wished Bruce well and Bruce gave the rapper a copy of \"Dog Beats\", beginning the two rappers' friendship and professional relationship.\n\nIn late 1991, the group invested more money into production than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta rap style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. After the change in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the \"I.C.P.\" initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed. Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: Insane Clown Posse. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted hype man. Upon returning home that night, Bruce says he had a dream in which \"spirits in a traveling carnival appeared to him\"—an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series, beginning with \"Carnival of Carnage\".\n\n\"Wizard of the Hood\" was later re-released, slightly different, on ICP's debut album \"Carnival of Carnage\". The remaining three tracks were included in the first \"Forgotten Freshness\" compilation, while the re-release of said compilation \"Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\" included only \"Dog Beats\", omitting the other two tracks.\n\nThe album was reissued on CD at the Gathering of the Juggalos 2000.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806625", "title": "Gísla saga", "text": "Gísla saga\n\nGísla saga Súrssonar (, \"the saga of Gísli Súrsson\") is one of the sagas of Icelanders. It tells the story of Gísli, a tragic hero who must kill one of his brothers-in-law to avenge another brother-in-law. Gisli is outlawed and forced to stay on the run for thirteen years before he is finally hunted down and killed. The events depicted in the saga take place between 860 and 980. The saga existed in oral tradition until it was recorded, most likely in the 13th century. In 1981, it was made into a film titled \"\".\n\n\"Gísla saga\" survives in thirty-three manuscripts and fragments from the Middle Ages down to the twentieth century. It is generally thought to have been composed in written form in the first half of the thirteenth century, but the earliest manuscript, the fragment Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 445 c I 4to, is from around 1400 and the earliest extensive text in AM 556a 4to, from the later fifteenth. The saga is generally thought to exist in three main versions originating in the Middle Ages:\n\nThe longer version differs from the shorter mainly in having a profoundly different (and longer) version of the opening sequence of the saga's narrative, set in Norway. The parts set in Iceland are substantially similar.\n\nThere is a consensus that the written archetype of \"Gísla saga\" was composed in the thirteenth century, with voices tending towards the middle of the century, and most commentators preferring 1225×50. However, there is little hard evidence to support this.\n\nIn the opening chapter set in Norway, Gisli Thorkelsson is an uncle and namesake of the saga's title character. This Gisli avenges his elder brother Ari, defeating a berserker with a sword of assured victory named Grásiða (Grey-blade, Grey-flank, Graysteel). But he refuses to return the sword borrowed from his wife's thrall Kol, and the ensuing squabble results in the death of both men and a broken sword. The thrall lays a curse against the family on this sword in the longer version.\n\nThe estate at Surnadal then passes from (Ari and Gisli Thorkelsson) to Thorbjorn Thorkelsson Sur, whose son Gisli Sursson is the title hero.\n\nGisli and his elder brother Thorkel develop a strained relationship over whether to support Bard, a man seducing their elder sister Thordis. Gisli kills Bard, and Thorkel incites the dead man's relative Skeggi the Dueller (Hólmgang-Skeggi) to take revenge and stand as suitor for Thordis. The dueller challenges Kolbjorn who has become Thordis's new preferred suitor, but Gisli fights the duel instead and prevails over Skeggi who has a ringing sword named Gunnlogi (Battle-flame).\n\nEven though Gisli spared the dueller's life, the dueller's sons forcibly recruit Kolbjorn, and the band sets fire to the hero's family house. Thorbjorn earns his nickname \"Súr\" (\"Whey\", \"Soursop\") by dousing fire using the whey in the stables. Gisli and Thorkel retaliate by exterminating the perpetrators.\n\n\nAround 952, the hero's family leave Norway and move to the Westfjords of Iceland. The siblings marry: Gisli marries Aud, sister of Vestein Vesteinsson; Thorkel marries a woman named Asgerd; and Thordis marries Thorgrim Thorsteinsson the Godi. They live as neighbors, the brothers at Hol, and Thorgrim at Saebol.\n\nWhile attending a thing (an assembly), the hero's close-knit group learns that a wise man named Gest has predicted discord among them (the \"Haukdal men\") in three years. To forestall this, Gisli, Thorkel, Thorgrim (brother-in-law to both), and Vestein (Gisli's brothers-in-law) decide to enter a pact of blood brotherhood (, \"foster brotherhood\"). However, Thorgrim has a change of heart and the pact is not completed. From this moment on the characters’ actions seem to be largely controlled by fate as they head down a tragic path.\n\nA chain of dreadful events is set into motion when Thorkel is eavesdropping and overhears his wife Asgerd and Gisli's wife Aud talking about their past loves. Thorkel learns that his wife was actually fond of Vestein before she married. Gisli too learns from his wife that she had been fond of Thorgrim the Godi prior to marriage. Thorkel reacts to the news more badly than Gisli, and first lashes out at his wife by refusing to let her sleep in the same bed as him, which is immediately quashed by her who threatens him with divorce.\nThorkel then decides he must part company with his brother, and take up farming with Thorgrim, demanding a division of their assets. Thorkel will relinquish the land and farm, but will claim movable assets, including the broken heirloom sword Grásiða. Thorkel and Thorgrim have the sword reforged as a spear, with the assistance of a black magician and blacksmith named Thorgrim Nef (Nose, or Bottlenose).\n\nThorkel now in league with Thorgrim discuss various things, perhaps even planning Vestein's murder.\n\nVestein returns from abroad and is reported to be heading for Gisli's home. Gisli sends his farmhands to warn Vestein away, entrusting his messengers with a special coin he crafted as a token of dire danger. But Vestein refuses to heed the warning. Along the way Vestein meets more people who tell him to be on guard. At Saebol (Thorgrim and Thorkel's farm), the boy Geirmund tells him not to tarry and go straight to Gisli (this boy lived with Gisli and Thorgrim, until the brothers split their assets). The boy refuses to admit seeing Vestein.\n\nWhile lodging at the home of Gisli and Auda, Vestein is discovered stabbed to death by a spear. The saga states that the custom obligated the person who extracted the murder weapon to carry out vengeance, and Gisli takes the spear (Grásiða). No witness saw the murderer, but Gisli has been haunted by dreams for several nights, and is convinced he knows the murderer. Gisli will later kill Thorgrim, but there are some psychological developments in the wake of Vestein's death.\n\n\nGisli sent his foster daughter Gudrid (Geirmund's sister) to Saebol to see what was happening, and discovered that Throgrim, Thorkel and the rest are fully armed, prepared for a fight. Thorkel commented on Vesteinn's death that there was a time when that would have been \"regarded as news indeed\". Thorkel also insisted on knowing if Aud is griefstricken, posing the question twice to Gisli; this has been analyzed as petty bit of schadenfreude on Thorkel's part.\n\nThorgrim on the other hand said in the girl Gudrid's presence that respect must be paid to Vestein's death, and in fact played the role of placing the \"Hel-shoes\" () onto Vestein's body to prepare it for interment in the burial mound. However, during the subsequent ball-games (\"knattleikr\") in which he was bested by Gisli, he leered towards Vestein's mound and recited in verse that the sound of spear biting into the man caused him no anguish, which has been construed to be Thorgrim gloating over Vestein's death and taunting Gisli to take revenge if he dares.\n\nDespite these innuendoes, it has been commented that shorter version of the saga does not make absolutely clear if Thorgrim had been the one who actually stabbed Vestein to death, even though he is definitely the culprit in the longer version.\n\nIn order to avenge the death of Vestein, a man to whom he is bound, Gisli murders Thorgrim and escapes into the night without being discovered. However, Thordis, Gisli’s widowed sister, suspects that Gisli must have murdered her husband, and tells her new husband, Thorgrim's brother Bork. Bork is persuaded to pursue a lawsuit of outlawry, rather than attempt to kill Gisli at once. Once Gisli is outlawed he constantly runs from a group of men who wish to find and murder him, led by Bork. This task proves to be more difficult than perceived, as they are unable to locate Gisli in his various hiding places. While Gisli is on the run, Vestein's two sons decide to seek their own vengeance for their father's murder. The two boys murder Thorkel. Both Bork and Gisli wish to avenge the death, but others, relatives of Vestein such as Gisli's wife Aud, discourage it and nothing is done. Gisli says that it is just as well that he has not met nor will ever meet the lads. The lads' fates are mentioned on the last page of the saga.\n\nAud, Gisli’s wife, remains loyal throughout the saga and refuses to divulge the location of her husband, even when Eyjolf offers her three hundred silver pieces, help in remarriage and reminds her of her current hard life at Geirthjofsfjordhur. Gisli's dreams of a mysterious woman pouring blood on him continue to plague him, and eventually he is not able to run from his problems or the people who are hunting him. After Gisli is discovered, Aud and their foster-daughter Gudrid fight side-by-side with Gisli until he is killed in a final, strenuous battle. Even after Gisli is dead, he is still honoured and respected for being a loyal and honest man. The saga notes that his final blow was just as strong as his first. Once Gisli faces his death, Thordis experiences remorse for his murder and stabs Eyjolf in the leg. After Bork wrenches the sword out of her hand and attempts to calm the group, Thordis declares herself divorced from Bork and leaves the house. Aud and five others leave Iceland. Aud converts to the Christian faith and with Gunhillda the widow of Vestein takes a pilgrimage to Rome, never to return to Iceland.\n\n\"Gísla saga\" is a classic outlaw saga that is centered on the internal struggles of Gisli. As Gisli's fate unfolds, he experiences conflicting passions of love, hate, and complex emotional bonds. Differing from the typical family saga, it uses the common theme of vengeance to divide loyalties within family instead of strengthening familial bonds. More than most sagas, \"Gísla saga\" makes use of motifs from the Eddaic poems, in particular by referring to Guðrún Gjúkadóttir to represent old ways of vengeance and family honor.\n\nIn contrast to the heroic Gisli is his elder brother Thorkel, one of whose major flaws is pointed out to be that of laziness. When the brothers divide their property Thorkel concedes that he is making Gisli perform all the work of running the farm., and when Thorkel eavesdrops on his wife, this is because he was lazily warming himself at the house while everyone else was laboring hard during the busiest time at the farm. The longer version explicitly calls Thorkel lazy, and adds he is a dandy preoccupied more with fashionable attire than labor.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1806646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806646", "title": "Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury", "text": "Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury\n\nSymbols of the United States Department of the Treasury include the Flag of the Treasury Department and the U.S. Treasury Seal. The seal actually predates the department itself, having originated with the Board of Treasury during the period of the Articles of Confederation. The seal is used on all U.S. paper currency, and (like other departmental seals) on official Treasury documents.\n\nThe seal includes a chevron with thirteen stars, representing the original thirteen states. Above the chevron is a balance, representing justice. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust.\n\nThe phrase is around the rim, and (the year the department was established) is at the bottom. This inscription is in a Cheltanham Bold font.\n\nIn 1778, the Second Continental Congress named John Witherspoon, Gouverneur Morris and Richard Henry Lee to design seals for the Treasury and the Navy. The committee reported on a design for the Navy the following year, but there is no record of a report about a seal for the Treasury.\n\nThe actual creator of the U.S. Treasury seal was Francis Hopkinson, who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and also contributed to the design of the Great Seal of the United States. He is known to have later submitted bills to the Congress in 1780 seeking payment for his design of flags, currency, and several seals, including one for the Board of Treasury. The earliest known usage of the seal was in 1782. When the United States Government was established in 1789, the new Department of the Treasury continued to use the existing seal.\n\nIn addition to the elements still found on the current seal, the original featured more ornamentation and the Latin inscription around the rim. The inscription is an abbreviation for the phrase \"Thesauri Americae Septentrionalis Sigillum\", which translates to \"The Seal of the Treasury of North America\". The reason for the original wording that embraced all of North America is unknown, although the first national bank—chartered in 1781 to help solidify the nation's finances—was named the Bank of North America.\n\nAfter nearly 200 years, Treasury Secretary Henry H. Fowler approved a new, simplified version of the seal on January 29, 1968. The Latin inscription was replaced by the English , and was added at the bottom.\n\nThe Treasury seal has been printed on virtually all U.S. federally-issued paper currency, starting with the Legal Tender Notes (United States Notes) in 1862 and continuing today. The only exceptions were the Demand Notes of 1861 (the original \"greenbacks\") and the first three issues of fractional (less than a dollar) notes in the 1860s; in both cases the authorizing laws did not require the seal.\n\nInitially the U.S. Government had no means to produce bills on its own, so the first paper bills were printed by private firms and then sent to the Treasury Department for final processing. Along with trimming and separating the bills, this processing included the overprinting of the seal onto the notes (even today, the serial number and seal are overprinted on the notes after the face has been printed). This was the beginning of what was later known as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. In July 1869, the Bureau began to print notes on its own.\nFor several decades, the color and style of the printed seal varied greatly from issue to issue (and even within the same issue). The basic seal was the same, but the circumferences were embellished with lathework decoration such as scallops, beading, \nor spikes. Among the colors used for the seal during this period were red, blue, and brown.\n\nThe usage of the seal was standardized starting on the smaller-sized notes of Series 1928. The seal was printed with a toothed outer edge, and other than the color were the same across all styles of currency. Federal Reserve Notes were issued with a green seal, silver certificates with a blue seal, gold certificates with an orange seal, United States Notes with a red seal, and National Bank Notes and Federal Reserve Bank Notes with brown seals.\nDuring World War II, special versions of Federal Reserve Notes and Silver Certificates were printed with the word on each end, and circulated only in Hawaii between 1942 and 1944. The seal and serial numbers were brown to further distinguish them from regular notes. In the event that Hawaii was captured by enemy forces, the special notes could be declared worthless. Similarly, special Silver Certificates were issued for use by American troops during the invasion of North Africa in November 1942. These notes had a distinctive yellow treasury seal, which would again allow them to be declared worthless if large amounts fell into enemy hands.\n\nIn Series 1950, the general design of all Federal Reserve Notes was changed slightly, and a smaller seal was used. The 1968 version of the Treasury Seal had first been used on the $100 United States Note in Series 1966, and was later introduced on all Federal Reserve Notes starting with Series 1969.\n\nThe watchdog seal dates from around 1800. Its origin is a matter of speculation, as is the extent of its use at the time. It has long disappeared from Treasury documents, but the original plate of the seal is on deposit at the United States Government Printing Office.\n\nThe seal contains a symbolic strongbox, with the Scales of Justice on top. Lying beside the strongbox is a capable looking watchdog, with his left front paw securely clasping a large key. The seal bears the lettering \"U.S. Treasury\", and is bordered by a wreath. The scales and the key are also incorporated on the official seal.\n\nThe United States Mint did in fact own a real watchdog named Nero, who was originally purchased in 1793 for $3 and accompanied the night watchman on his rounds. Treasury documents record further expenditures for Nero and successor watchdogs over the following twenty-five years, and currently Sherman. According to department legend, Nero is the canine depicted on the seal, and may have been the origin (or at least the inspiration) of the term \"Watchdog of the Treasury\".\n\nThe Flag of the Treasury Department was approved on January 11, 1963, by C. Douglas Dillon, the 57th Secretary of the Treasury, and was first displayed on July 1, 1963. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the flag is defined as follows:\n\nIn addition to the departmental flag, several personal flags, or standards, are used to represent different U.S. Treasury Department officials, such as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n"}

The phrase \"Thief in Law\" is a rudimentary, word-by-word translation of the Russian slang phrase \"вор в зако́не\", literally translated as \"a thief in [a position of] the law\", that can have two meanings in Russian: \"a legalized thief\" and \"a thief who is the law\". Note that \"Vor\" came to mean \"thief\" no earlier than the 18th century, before that it meant \"criminal\" (and it still means that in the professional criminal argot). Each new \"Vor\" (thief) is vetted (literally \"crowned\", with respective rituals and tattoos) by consensus of several \"Vory\". Vor culture is inseparable from prison organized crime: only repeatedly jailed convicts are eligible for Vor status. Thieves in law are drawn from many nationalities from a number of post-Soviet states, but an absolute majority are ethnic Georgians and also other ethnic minorities from Georgia.\n\nAlthough Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia and Uzbekistan have long had criminals and bandits, during the disorder of the Russian Revolution of 1917, armed gangs proliferated until they became a very significant factor which controlled society. The criminal culture with its own slang, culture and laws became known as \"Vorovskoy Mir\" () or \"Criminal/Thieves World\".\n\nAs the police and court system were re-established in the Soviet Union shortly after the 1917 revolution, the NKVD secret police nearly exterminated the criminal underworld completely. Under Stalin, the forced labor camps (Gulag) overflowed with political prisoners and criminals, and a new organized group of top criminals arose, the \"vory v zakone\", or \"thieves in law.\"\n\nThe \"thieves in law\" formed as a society for ruling the criminal underworld within the prison camps, \"who govern the dark gaps in Soviet life beyond the reach of the KGB\". They adopted a system of collective responsibility, and swore to a code of \"complete submission to the laws of criminal life, including obligations to support the criminal ideal, rejection of legitimate employment (one must support oneself through criminal enterprises) and refusal to participate in all political activities.\"\n\nAs an example, while incarcerated, a Vor (вор) must refuse all work, and is not allowed to assist the warden/correction officers in any way, as the thieves' code states: \"Your own prison you shall not make.\" For example, if an inmate walks past a guard, and the guard asks him to ring the dinner bell, the convict must refuse or he will be judged by his fellow inmates and found guilty of assisting his jailers. The Vory organized their own courts and held trials governed by the code of 'thieves' honor and tradition'. Acceptance into the group is often marked by specific tattoos, allowing all members of the criminal world to instantly recognize a \"thief in law\". Most prison inmates are tattooed (by other inmates) to indicate their rank within the criminal world, noteworthy criminal accomplishments and places of former incarceration. For example, a tattoo of one cat indicates that the criminal robs alone while multiple cats indicate that he has partners during robberies. Reportedly, \"while the Communist Party had a steadfast grip on government and society, the Vory had something of a monopoly on crime.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the \"vory\" in the Gulag system were weakened by the so-called Bitch Wars – a prison gang war between pure \"vory\" and the so-called \"suki\" (\"bitches\"). The 'suki' were former members of the criminal underworld who had broken the thieves' code by agreeing to join the Soviet army and fight against Nazi Germany during World War II (in exchange for being freed from prison).\n\nBy joining the army, they violated the Thieves' Code which expressly forbids assisting authority in any way. After the end of the war, thousands were re-arrested again for new crimes and were placed at the very bottom of the criminal hierarchy in prison, treated with the same lack of respect shown to police informants and victims of prison rape.\n\nSince most 'suki' were tough, lifelong criminals and assassins hardened by the experience of brutal combat during World War II, they decided to murder all the 'pure vory'. This resulted in the so-called Bitch Wars which lasted for decades. Due to a large number of 'suki', most gulags were divided into two separate zones: one for 'suki' and one for 'vory'.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the \"vory\" assumed a leading role within the Russian criminal hierarchy (see Russian mafia). The group was able to \"infiltrate the top political and economic strata while taking command of the burgeoning crime network that spread murderously through the post-Soviet countries.\" Thieves In Law are given the title by other \"vory\" and in order to be accepted they must demonstrate considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect, charisma, along with a well-documented criminal record. Once accepted they must live according to the thieves' code. The penalty for violation of this code is often mutilation or death. Reportedly, \"today the Vory have spread around the world, to Madrid, Berlin, and New York\" and are \"involved in everything from petty theft to billion-dollar money-laundering while also acting as arbiters among conflicting Russian criminal factions.\"\n\nReportedly, as capitalism began to take hold in Russia, an increasing number of college-educated criminals began to take over more lucrative ventures. While these new criminal elements first worked with the Vory in the 1990s, in the 2000s (decade), ties to big business and government grew in importance. Consequently, while the \"Vory are still strong in gambling and retail trade,\" their importance in Russian economy and society has decreased. However, since the majority of criminals eventually are arrested and incarcerated, at some point they will come in contact with the Vory who are at the top of the hierarchy of the criminal world within the penal system in Russia.\n\nA famous \"vor\" was Vyacheslav Ivankov.\n\nIn 2011, the Obama administration implemented sanctions against an organisation known as the Brothers' Circle, several members of which are thieves-in-law.\n\n\"Ponyatiya\" (literally \"the understandings\") is the rules of conduct (or even the customary law or code of honor) among prison inmates, with Vory being respectful leaders and judges according to these rules.\n\nVory consider prisons their true home and have a saying, \"The home for angels is heaven, and the home for a Vor is prison.\" According to Aleksandr Gurov, an expert on the Vory who headed the organized crime units of the Soviet Interior Ministry and the GRU, \"unlike the Cosa Nostra the Vory have 'less rules, but more severe rules' [and the] members must have no ties to the government, meaning they cannot serve in the army or cooperate with officials while in prison. They must also have served several jail sentences before they can be considered. They also are not allowed to get married.\"\n\nFurthermore, according to Michael Schwirtz Levkiv \"ethnicity has rarely determined whether someone can join the club, and today many members, even those active inside Russia, are from other post-Soviet countries such as Armenia, Georgia, or Chechnya, and are not ethnic Russians.\"\n\nWhile there still are many ethnic Russian vory, many also are drawn from other ethnic groups from the former Soviet Union.\n\nUnder the theoretical code of the \"vory\", a thief must:\n\nThe above code is no longer in use besides the standard prison code of ethics of not cooperating with prison authorities or informing on your fellow inmates. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of \"The Gulag Archipelago\", claimed never to have seen any thief honor the code if it conflicted with his personal criminal wants.\n\nThe Vory subculture (more exactly: the prison inmate subculture where Vory are the leaders) is well known for having symbolic tattoos. The tattoos are usually done in the prison with primitive tools.\n\nTattoos associated with the thieves in law include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her son Carl Schepler (1870-1942) took it over in 1898. The store started as a retailer of milk and eggs but later expanded into packaged groceries such as tea and sugar. Schepler also opened more stores and changed the name to Carl Scheplers Udsalg. The chain had grown to 110 stores at the time of his death in 1942. \n\nNone of Schepler's heirs wanted to take over the company and it was therefore sold to a consortium of four egg wholesalers. The name of the stores were changed to Irma in 1943 and the Irma girl was adopted as its new logo.\n\nBørge Olsen joined the company as assistant director in 1946 and became managing director in 1951. He converted the chain into a modern supermarket chain, introducing many new initiatives such as self-service and price and date labelling. The first self-service store opened in Nykøbing Falster in 1950.\n\nThe chain was sold to Privatbanken, Odense Ægforretning, and Gutenberghus. Børge Olsen, who became known as Irma-Olsen, was managing director until 1979.\n\nFDB acquired Irma for DKK 300 million in 1982. FDB unsuccessfully attempted to expand the chain geographically with the opening of three stores in Odense and they closed again in the late 1980s.\n\nThe 1980s were crisis years for the Irma chain. Many stores closed and associated activities were sold off. Irma Kantineservice, a food service company with 200 employees, was sold to ISS in 1987, a softdrink factory and Dansk Ægcentral was sold in 1988, the dairy Kongstedlund was sold to MD Foods and Irma's wine bottling plant was sold to Danica in 1990.\n\nIn 1993, FDB announced its intention to close the chain. 30 Irma stores were converted to SuperBrugsen stores, 23 were converted to Fakta stores and the remaining 66 stores were put up for sale.\n\nThe media attention better economic times boosted the sale and the plans to close the chain were therefore cancelled. Jørgen Pedersen was appointed to CEO in 1994 and was succeeded by Alfred Josefsen in 1999.\n\nIrma's headquarters moved from Rødovre to Coop D's headquarters in Albertslund. Alfred Josefsen was succeeded by Jesper Uggerhøj on 1 October 2012.\n\nIrma operates stores under two formats: supermarkets and Irma City's convenience stores. It also operates Irma Online internet shopping services.\n\nIrma operates a total of some 80 supermarkets of which the majority is located in Copenhagen. The chain is also represented in Gilleleje, Hillerød, Holbæk, Humlebæk, Køge, Næstved, Nykøbing Sjælland and Slagelse.\n\nIrma opened the first Irma City convenience stores in 2001 and now operates at total of four stores in central locations of Inner Copenhagen. They are located at Vesterbros Torv (Vesterbrogade 46) in Vesterbro, Østerbrogade 110 in Østerbro and Nørrebrogade 3 and Nørrebros Runddel (Nørrebrogade 124) in Nørrebro.

{"id": "1806671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806671", "title": "Names of Japan", "text": "Names of Japan\n\nThe word \"Japan\" is an exonym, and is used (in one form or another) by many languages. The Japanese names for Japan are Nippon () and Nihon (). They are both written in Japanese using the kanji .\n\nBefore \"Nihon\" came into official use, Japan was known in China as \"Wa\" () or \"Wakoku\" (). The name was first used during the third-century Three Kingdoms period, and can be translated as \"dwarf\" or \"submissive\". The native name for Japan, \"Yamato\", was written using the character until the eighth century, when Japanese scribes found fault with its offensive connotation and requested that the name \"Nippon\" be used instead. The earliest record of appears in the Chinese \"Old Book of Tang\", which notes the change in 703. In Japan, the character for \"Wa\" was replaced with the homophone (\"peaceful, harmonious\"), which was often combined with (\"great\") to form the name , also read as \"Yamato\". During the Heian period, was gradually replaced by , which was first pronounced with the Chinese reading \"Nippon\" and later as \"Nihon\", reflecting shifts in phonology.\n\nBoth \"Nippon\" and \"Nihon\" literally mean \"the sun's origin\", that is, where the sun originates, and are often translated as the \"Land of the Rising Sun\". This nomenclature comes from Imperial correspondence with the Chinese Sui Dynasty and refers to Japan's eastern position relative to China. Before \"Nihon\" came into official use, Japan was known as or . \"Wa\" was a name early China used to refer to an ethnic group living in Japan around the time of the Three Kingdoms Period.\n\nAlthough the etymological origins of \"Wa\" remain uncertain, Chinese historical texts recorded an ancient people residing in the Japanese archipelago (perhaps Kyūshū), named something like *ˀWâ or *ˀWər . Carr (1992:9–10) surveys prevalent proposals for Wa's etymology ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns \"waga\" \"my; our\" and \"ware\" \"I; oneself; thou\") to shameful (writing Japanese \"Wa\" as implying \"dwarf\"), and summarizes interpretations for *ˀWâ \"Japanese\" into variations on two etymologies: \"behaviorally 'submissive' or physically 'short'.\" The first \"submissive; obedient\" explanation began with the (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary. It defines as \"shùnmào\" \"obedient/submissive/docile appearance\", graphically explains the \"person; human\" radical with a \"wěi\" \"bent\" phonetic, and quotes the above \"Shijing\" poem. \"Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese,\" Carr (1992:9) suggests \"they transcribed Wa as *ˀWâ 'bent back' signifying 'compliant' bowing/obeisance. Bowing is noted in early historical references to Japan.\" Examples include \"Respect is shown by squatting\" (\"Hou Han Shu\", tr. Tsunoda 1951:2), and \"they either squat or kneel, with both hands on the ground. This is the way they show respect.\" (Wei Zhi, tr. Tsunoda 1951:13). Koji Nakayama interprets \"wēi\" \"winding\" as \"very far away\" and euphemistically translates \"Wō\" as \"separated from the continent.\" The second etymology of \"wō\" meaning \"dwarf, pygmy\" has possible cognates in \"ǎi\" \"low, short (of stature)\", \"wō\" \"strain; sprain; bent legs\", and \"wò\" \"lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)\". Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a \"Zhūrúguó\" \"pygmy/dwarf country\" located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as \"submissive people\" and the \"Country of Dwarfs\" legend as evidence that the \"little people\" etymology was a secondary development.\n\nChinese, Korean, and Japanese scribes regularly wrote \"Wa\" or \"Yamato\" \"Japan\" with the Chinese character until the 8th century, when the Japanese found fault with it due to its offensive connotation, replacing it with \"harmony, peace, balance\". Retroactively, this character was adopted in Japan to refer to the country itself, often combined with the character (literally meaning \"Great\"), so as to write the name as \"Yamato\" () (Great Wa, in a manner similar to \"e.g.\" Great Qing Empire, Greater British Empire). However, the pronunciation \"Yamato\" cannot be formed from the sounds of its constituent characters; it refers to a place in Japan and is speculated to originally mean \"Mountain Gate\" (山戸). Such words which use certain kanji to name a certain Japanese word solely for the purpose of representing the word's meaning regardless of the given kanji's on'yomi or kun'yomi, a.k.a. jukujikun, is not uncommon in Japanese. Other original names in Chinese texts include \"Yamatai country\" (), where a Queen Himiko lived. When \"hi no moto\", the indigenous Japanese way of saying \"sun's origin\", was written in kanji, it was given the characters . In time, these characters began to be read using Sino-Japanese readings, first \"Nippon\" and later \"Nihon,\" although the two names are interchangeable to this day.\n\n\"Nippon\" appeared in history only at the end of the 7th century. The \"Old Book of Tang\" (), one of the Twenty-Four Histories, stated that the Japanese envoy disliked his country's name \"Woguo\" (Chinese) (), and changed it to \"Nippon\" (Japanese; Mandarin Chinese: \"Rìběn,\" Toisan Cantonese\":\" \"Ngìp Bāwn\") (), or \"Origin of the Sun\". Another 8th-century chronicle, \"True Meaning of Shiji\" (), however, states that the Chinese Empress Wu Zetian ordered a Japanese envoy to change the country's name to \"Nippon\". It has been suggested that the name change in Japan may have taken place sometime between 665 and 703, and Wu Zetian then acceded to the name change in China following a request from a delegation from Japan in 703. The sun plays an important role in Japanese mythology and religion as the emperor is said to be the direct descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu and the legitimacy of the ruling house rested on this divine appointment and descent from the chief deity of the predominant Shinto religion. The name of the country reflects this central importance of the sun. The association of the country with the sun was indicated in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the Sui dynasty. Prince Shōtoku, the Regent of Japan, sent a mission to China with a letter in which he called himself . The message said: \"The Son of Heaven, in the land of the rising sun, sends this letter to the Son of Heaven of the land, where the sun sets, and wishes him well\".\nThe English word for Japan came to the West from early trade routes. The early Mandarin Chinese or possibly Wu Chinese word for Japan was recorded by Marco Polo as \"Cipangu\". In modern Toisanese (a language in the Yue Chinese subgroup), 日本 is pronounced as \"Ngìp Bāwn\" ], which sounds nearly identical to \"Nippon.\" The Malay and Indonesian words \"Jepang\", \"Jipang\", and \"Jepun\" were borrowed from non-Mandarin Chinese languages, and this Malay word was encountered by Portuguese traders in Malacca in the 16th century. It is thought the Portuguese traders were the first to bring the word to Europe. It was first recorded in English in 1577 spelled \"Giapan\".\n\nIn English, the modern official title of the country is simply \"Japan\", one of the few nation-states to have no \"long form\" name. The official Japanese-language name is \"Nippon-koku\" or \"Nihon-koku\" (), literally \"\"State of Japan\"\". From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was the \"Empire of Greater Japan\" ( \"Dai Nippon Teikoku\"). A more poetic rendering of the name of Japan during this period was \"Empire of the Sun.\" The official name of the nation was changed after the adoption of the post-war constitution; the title \"State of Japan\" is sometimes used as a colloquial modern-day equivalent. As an adjective, the term \"Dai-Nippon\" remains popular with Japanese governmental, commercial, or social organizations whose reach extend beyond Japan's geographic borders (e.g., Dai Nippon Printing, Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, etc.).\n\nThough \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" are still by far the most popular names for Japan from within the country, recently the foreign words \"Japan\" and even \"Jipangu\" (from \"Cipangu\", see below) have been used in Japanese mostly for the purpose of foreign branding.\n\nPortuguese missionaries arrived in Japan at the end of the 16th century. In the course of learning Japanese, they created several grammars and dictionaries of Middle Japanese. The 1603–1604 dictionary Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam contains two entries for Japan: \"nifon\" and \"iippon\".\nThe title of the dictionary (\"Vocabulary of the Language of Japan\") illustrates that the Portuguese word for Japan was by that time \"Iapam\".\n\nHistorically, Japanese has undergone a number of phonological changes. Originally *, this weakened into and eventually became the modern . Modern is still pronounced when followed by .\n\nMiddle Japanese \"nifon\" becomes Modern Japanese \"nihon\" via regular phonological changes.\n\nBefore modern styles of romanization, the Portuguese devised their own. In it, is written as either \"ii\" or \"ji\". In modern Hepburn style, \"iippon\" would be rendered as \"Jippon\". There are no historical phonological changes to take into account here.\n\nEtymologically, \"Jippon\" is similar to \"Nippon\" in that it is an alternative reading of . The initial character may also be read as or . Compounded with (), this regularly becomes \"Jippon\".\n\nUnlike the \"Nihon\"/\"Nippon\" doublet, there is no evidence for a *\"Jihon\".\n\nThe Japanese name for Japan, , can be pronounced either \"Nihon\" or \"Nippon\". Both readings come from the on'yomi.\n\n (\"nichi\") means \"sun\" or \"day\"; (\"hon\") means \"base\" or \"origin\". The compound means \"origin of the sun\" or \"where the sun rises\" (from a Chinese point of view, the sun rises from Japan); it is a source for the popular Western description of Japan as the \"Land of the Rising Sun\".\n\n\"Nichi\", in compounds, often loses the final \"chi\" and creates a slight pause between the first and second syllables of the compound. When romanised, this pause is represented by a doubling of the first consonant of the second syllable; thus \"nichi\" plus \"kō\" (light) is written and pronounced \"nikkō\", meaning sunlight.\n\nJapanese and were historically pronounced \"niti\" (or \"jitu\", reflecting a Late Middle Chinese pronunciation) and \"pon\", respectively. In compounds, however, final voiceless stops (i.e. \"p\", \"t\", \"k\") of the first word were unreleased in Middle Chinese, and the pronunciation of 日本 was thus \"Nippon\" or \"Jippon\" (with the adjacent consonants assimilating).\n\nHistorical sound change in Japanese has led to the modern pronunciations of the individual characters as \"nichi\" and \"hon\". The pronunciation \"Nihon\" originated, possibly in the Kantō region, as a reintroduction of this independent pronunciation of into the compound. This must have taken place during the Edo period, after another sound change occurred which would have resulted in this form becoming \"Niwon\" and later \"Nion\".\n\nSeveral attempts to decidedly determine an official reading were rejected by the Japanese government, who declared both as being correct.\n\nWhile both pronunciations are correct, \"Nippon\" is frequently preferred for official purposes, including money, stamps, and international sporting events, as well as the \"Nippon-koku\", literally the \"\"State of Japan\"\" ().\n\nOther than this, there seem to be no fixed rules for choosing one pronunciation over the other; in some cases one form is simply more common. For example, Japanese speakers generally call their language \"Nihongo\"; \"Nippongo\", while possible,\nis rare. In other cases, uses are variable. The name for the Bank of Japan (), for example, is given as \"NIPPON GINKO\" on banknotes, but often referred to (in the media, for example) as \"Nihon Ginkō\".\n\nNippon is used always or most often in the following constructions:\n\nNihon is used always or most often in the following constructions:\n\nIn 2016, element 113 on the periodic table was named nihonium to honor its discovery in 2004 by Japanese scientists at RIKEN. This is unrelated to \"nipponium\", a defunct synonym for the element rhenium.\n\nAs mentioned above, the English word \"Japan\" has a circuitous derivation; but linguists believe it derives in part from the Portuguese recording of the early Mandarin Chinese or Wu Chinese word for Japan: \"Cipan\" (), which is rendered in pinyin as \"Rìběn\" (IPA: ʐʅ˥˩pən˨˩˦), and literally translates to \"sun origin\". \"Guó\" (IPA: kuo˨˦) is Chinese for \"realm\" or \"kingdom\", so it could alternatively be rendered as \"Cipan-guo\". The word was likely introduced to Portuguese through the Malay \"Jipang\".\n\nCipangu was first mentioned in Europe in the accounts of Marco Polo. It appears for the first time on a European map with the Fra Mauro map in 1457, although it appears much earlier on Chinese and Korean maps such as the \"Gangnido\". Following the accounts of Marco Polo, Cipangu was thought to be fabulously rich in silver and gold, which in Medieval times was largely correct, owing to the volcanism of the islands and the possibility to access precious ores without resorting to (unavailable) deep-mining technologies.\n\nThe Dutch name, Japan, may be derived from the southern Chinese pronunciation of , \"Yatbun\" or \"Yatpun\". The Dutch \"J\" is generally pronounced \"Y\", hence Ja-Pan.\n\nThe modern Shanghainese pronunciation of Japan is \"Zeppen\" . In modern Japanese, \"Cipangu\" is transliterated as which in turn can be transliterated into English as \"Chipangu\", \"Jipangu\", \"Zipangu\", \"Jipang\", or \"Zipang\". \"Jipangu\" ( (\"Zipangu\")) as an obfuscated name for Japan has recently come into vogue for Japanese films, anime, video games, etc.\n\nThese names were invented after the introduction of Chinese into the language, and they show up in historical texts for prehistoric legendary dates and also in names of gods and Japanese emperors:\n\n\nThe katakana transcription (\"Japan\") of the English word \"Japan\" is sometimes encountered in Japanese, for example in the names of organizations seeking to project an international image. Examples include (\"Japan Netto Ginkō\") (Japan Net Bank), (\"Japan Kappu\") (Japan Cup), (\"Waiyaresu Japan\") (Wireless Japan), etc.\n\n\"Dōngyáng\" () and \"Dōngyíng\" () – both literally, \"Eastern Ocean\" – are Chinese terms sometimes used to refer to Japan exotically when contrasting it with other countries or regions in eastern Eurasia; however, these same terms may also be used to refer to all of East Asia when contrasting \"the East\" with \"the West\". The first term, \"Dōngyáng\", has been considered to be a pejorative term when used to mean \"Japan\", while the second, \"Dōngyíng\", has remained a positive poetic name. They can be contrasted with \"Nányáng\" (Southern Ocean), which refers to Southeast Asia, and \"Xīyáng\" (Western Ocean), which refers to the Western world. In Japanese and Korean, the Chinese word for \"Eastern Ocean\" (pronounced as \"tōyō\" in Japanese and as \"dongyang\" () in Korean) is used only to refer to the Far East (including both East Asia and Southeast Asia) in general, and it is not used in the more specific Chinese sense of \"Japan\".\n\nIn China, Japan is called \"Rìběn\", which is the Mandarin pronunciation for the characters . The Cantonese pronunciation is \"Yahtbún\" , the Shanghainese pronunciation is \"Zeppen\" , and the Hokkien pronunciation is \"Ji̍tpún\" / \"Li̍t-pún\". This has influenced the Malay name for Japan, \"Jepun\", and the Thai word \"Yipun\" (). The terms \"Jepang\" and \"Jipang\", ultimately derived from Chinese, were previously used in both Malay and Indonesian, but are today confined primarily to the Indonesian language. The Japanese introduced \"Nippon\" and \"Dai Nippon\" into Indonesia during the Japanese Occupation (1942–1945) but the native \"Jepang\" remains more common. In Korean, Japan is called \"Ilbon\" (Hangeul: , Hanja: ), which is the Korean pronunciation of the Sino-Korean name, and in Sino-Vietnamese, Japan is called \"Nhật Bản\" (also rendered as \"Nhựt Bổn\").

In 1994 friends Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit established Yards after producing their own homebrews since 1988. Within the first few months, \"the Yards Guys\" were producing one six-keg batch at a time out of their 3.5-barrel brewhouse, and supplying ESA, Entire Porter, and several other cask-conditioned ales to bars. After several partnership changes, Kehoe has continued expanding the Yards brand by moving to larger locations and incrementally increasing the overall output capacity. In 2015, Yards was capable of brewing 55,000 barrels. Yards is currently planning yet another expansion, which would almost effectively double their brewing capability, raising the annual production volume to 200,000 barrels.\n\nYards ESA was first publicly poured at the Philadelphia Craft Beer Festival on April 29, 1995 in booth 406. Many people refer to this day as \"Ground Zero\" for today’s Philadelphia beer scene. Dawson Street Pub purchased one of the first ESA kegs from Yards, and offered hand-pumped pours to customers during a happy hour on Friday May 19, 1995. The remaining ESA kegs were self-delivered by Bovit and Kehoe to Khyber Pass, Cavanaugh's 39th Street, and Sugar Mom's. \n\nThe first facility was a garage-sized brewery located at 219 Krams Avenue in Manayunk. By the end of 1996, Yards had grown to a production capability of 795 barrels. In 1997 Yards moved to 5050 Umbria Street in the neighboring section of Roxborough. This larger facility allowed Yards to bottle its beer for the first time, and to contract brew for Manayunk Brewing Company, Dock Street Brewing Company, Barley Creek Brewing Company, and Gravity Brew Co., which has since closed. At the height of this location's production, Yards had brewed 2100 barrels.\n\nYards Brewing Company moved in 2001 to the old Weisbrod & Hess Brewery in Kensington. Tom Kehoe partnered and signed the lease for this property with Bill and Nancy Barton. At this new location, Yards was capable of brewing 10,000 barrels.\nThis partnership was short lived, and in 2007 Kehoe and the Barton family split ways. This allowed Kehoe to sign a lease on the current location property located in Northern Liberties. Within the first year at this new location Yards had brewed 6,500 barrels. This location was the first brewery in Pennsylvania to be powered, entirely, by wind. It features a 100-person maximum capacity pub-styled tasting room, featuring a 12-tap system, a century old billiards table, and a shuffleboard. The same year Yards \"went 100% green\" (2011), they achieved status as a \"Regional Craft Brewer\" by the Brewer's Association and reintroduced the original 3.5 barrel system, \"Yards One.\" As of 2015, the Northern Liberties location reached a capacity of 55,000 barrels and had successfully brewed 41,500 barrels. \n\nDespite the large output capacity, Kehoe desired an even larger facility. In 2016, Kehoe had stated that Yards was looking to move to a location on the 500 block of Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia. Out of the proposed location's 200,000 square feet, Yards' new facility would occupy 80,000 feet. Due to concerns of what would happen should Kehoe and the Yards team decide to move yet again, the zoning committee needed to further deliberate the location approval. As of March 2017, M&T Bank granted Yards Brewing Company an $8.5 million loan to begin constructing their new 70,000 square foot facility located in the now vacant Destination Maternity headquarters. The estimated cost for the completion of the project is $19 million. The remaining financial backing is reported to be coming from local and state financing. Construction is estimated around $6 million, while equipment is estimated to cost $13 million. Tom Kehoe stated that this \"labor of love\" would bring \"new life to this area of Spring Garden\" when it opens. The tentative launch date is set sometime between October and December 2017.\n\nYards Brewing Company takes tremendous pride in associating the city of Philadelphia with the country's founding fathers, not only for history's sake, but also as some were brewers themselves. In 1999, Yards launched a collaborative effort with City Tavern, which specializes in recreating 18th century recipes, to lay the foundation of what would become the Ales of the Revolution series. To create this series of history-inspired beers, Yards drew inspiration from brewing recipes originally belonging to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. By 2004, Thomas Jefferson’s Tavern Ale and General Washington’s Tavern Porter became available year-round. The following year, Yards began developing Poor Richards Tavern Spruce, in an effort to release an Ale of the Revolution for Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday in 2006.\n\nYards had been a self-distributing brewery, from Kehoe and Bovit's first keg deliveries of ESA to Dawson Street Pub, Khyber Pass, Cavanaugh's 39th St, and Sugar Mom's, until 2008. Yards then partnered with Muller, Inc to begin regional and interstate distribution. Currently, Yards' products are distributed throughout the Mid-Atlantic region with 80% of its nearly 40,000 barrel production being distributed in the Philadelphia tri-state area (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware). As of May 2015 Yards is the largest brewery operating in the city of Philadelphia.\n\nFriends Jon Bovit and Tom Kehoe had a long-standing history of brewing beers for their friends while in college. After completing a brewery internship with British Brewing Company in Maryland, the duo partnered and signed a lease for the original Manayunk facility. Despite the long-standing history between the two, and the brand gaining recognition, Bovit resigned from the company in 1999. While no longer a financial partner, Bovit is still reported to collaborate on certain brews with Kehoe. \n\nIn 2001, Kehoe found new financial and business partners, Nancy and Bill Barton. The trio moved on to open the Kensington location, in the restored Weisbrod and Hess brewery, which allowed Yards to construct a bottling line, and open a tasting room for the general public. Although this partnership only lasted until 2007, the company had gained financial stability, increased brand recognition, and quadrupled the brewery's output capacity. After their formal resignation in July 2007, the Barton family leased the space to Kehoe until he could find a new location for Yards. They then went on to transform their facility into the headquarters of the Philadelphia Brewing Company.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The fan forces airflow over the fixed surface to provide both lift and forward thrust.\n\nA cross-flow fan comprises blades radiating from a central axis and aligned with the axis, similar to those of a cylinder mower. It is contained in a duct which is shaped so that when the fan spins, it induces a directional airflow. In the FanWing, the fan is set above the leading section of a fixed wing and extends the full span of the wing. The wing upper surface is shaped around the fan to form a half-duct. The wing chord extends approximately as far again back from the fan, with the rear section shaped as a wedge-like fairing that extends to the trailing edge.\n\nWhen the fan spins with the upper edge moving backwards and the lower edge forwards, the fixed half-duct is shaped to create a net backward flow of air, resulting in forward thrust. This backward flow over the upper surfaces also creates a net circulation of air around the rotor-wing combination, resulting in vertical lift.\n\nAddition of an outboard tail recovers energy from the wing tip vortices to significantly increase overall efficiency. This in turn allows an even lower minimum forward speed.\n\nIn addition to providing forward thrust in its own right, the radial fan increases the velocity of the airflow over the wing's upper surface independently of the forward motion of the aircraft, thereby creating useful lift at forward speeds lower than the stalling speed for a conventional wing.\n\nBesides the added weight and complexity of the fan system, it has some limitations compared with a conventional fixed wing:\n\nAlthough the cross-flow fan has been known since the late nineteenth century, its use as a rotary aircraft wing was not studied until 1997 when Patrick Peebles, an American based in the UK, conceived of it as a STOL device and subsequently formed the FanWing Co. Wind tunnel tests and powered model flights were supported by UK government funding, winning SMART awards in 2002 and 2003. Work began on a prototype drone, ostensibly aimed at the STOL urban surveillance market. The benefits of adding a tail were discovered during continued development. By 2014, support for wind tunnel tests of a 1.5 meter wing section was being provided through EU sources including €783,000 through the German Aerospace Center.\n\nAs of December 2018, only unmanned development prototypes have flown.\n\n\n"}

It consists of four branches located in King City, Nobleton, Schomberg, and Ansnorveldt.\n\nThe library rotates certain books through the various branches to ensure all residents in the township have equal access to volumes held.\n\nCollections include government works (e.g. federal budgets), annual reports, and maps. Periodicals and newspapers are archived for a short period of time. The library also maintains township history archives at the King City branch.\n\nThe library system offers a number of programs for children and adults, plus language kits and multi-lingual books. A limited selection of music CDs and movie DVDs are available for loan in addition to book circulation.\n\nJames Whitling Crossley established the first library in King, the King City Mechanics and Library Association, which opened in 1893 in King City, and was housed in his office. In 1947, the King Memorial Library was established by members of the Women's Institute, and named to commemorate the local soldiers who died during World War II. It was a privately-operated library supervised by Marjorie Jarvis, who had been president of the Ontario Library Association in 1935—1936. It was located at Memorial Park in King City, first in an old barn, and later into a dedicated building. Its collection included about 1000 items. In 1956, the library was moved to 45 Springhill Road (now King Road) following a referendum of municipal taxpayers to operate it as a public library, and was named the King City Memorial Library. In 1969, its operations were merged into the Township of King Central Library, which received most of the collection of the private library. A new King City branch building was opened on 10 January 1970, on which day it received donations of many items, including a water colour painting of the previous building.\n\nIn 1930, a library was established in Schomberg, serving the growing communities in the northeastern portion of the township. The Nobleton branch first opened to the public in 1968. In 1990, a fundraising campaign was established to build a branch building in Ansnorveldt. The building cost to build, of which one third was funded by a government of Ontario grant, one third by the municipal government, and the remaining one third was raised by the community, including by students of the nearby school.\n\nIn 1976 and 1977, a dispute arose between the library board and the King Township Council regarding development of land adjacent to the King City branch into a lumber depot. The library opposed the rezoning of the property, leading to two Ontario Municipal Board hearings and an appeal to the Ontario High Court of Justice before plans for the lumber depot were abandoned.\n\nIn December 2016, a press release issued by the township municipal government stated that the King City branch would be expanded from to . The structure would also be expanded to include a senior's centre, which would move from its location adjacent to the community centre. It was expected to be completed in late 2018. The township issued a request for tender in 2017, but all six applications received by the November deadline exceeded the specified $9.05 million budget. In 2018 the request for tender was re-issued after the architectural designs were modified to reduce costs, and all twelve submissions once again exceeded the preliminary budget; the contract was awarded because township staff believed \"that it is highly unlikely further delay will result in better pricing\". The awarded construction contact is valued at $8,426,500, with a total project budget of $10,764,000. Funding will consist of $5,393,052 from development charges, $3 million from the issue of a debenture, and about $600,000 from reserves. The township also purchased 0.45 acres of land of the adjacent King City Public School from the York Region District School Board, which it will merge with the King City Library property.\n\nThe King City Library will close at the end of regular hours on 28 July 2018, after which it will move to the lower level of the King City Seniors Centre. It will reopen in the new location on 4 September 2018.\n\nThe current King City branch building was built in 1970 at 1970 King Road, opposite King City Secondary School. It cost () to build, and was designed by Dennis Bowman. The building is built into a hill, the lower floor at its rear overlooking a playground on the east side of King City Public School, and the upper floor level with the parking lot and King Road. The entry foyer is on the upper level, and incorporates a wood and wool mural, the wood components of which consisted of a variety of woods, including panga panga, redwood, maple, and teak. The interior is supported by Douglas fir beams spanning the upper floor.\n\nThe single-floor Nobleton branch building was opened in 1987. It is located at 8 Sheardown Drive where it intersects with Highway 27, across from Nobleton Plaza.\n\nThe entrance of the single-floor Schomberg branch building is on the north side of the building. The building is located at 77 Main Street.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony for the Ansnorveldt branch of the library was performed by the chairman of the King Township Public Library Margaret Smithyes and councillor for Holland Marsh Bob Vooberg. The building is located at 18977 Dufferin Street, adjacent to Andnorveldt Park. The collections are on the main floor, and a second floor is used for meetings and storage.\n\n\"According to the 2014 \"King Township Public Library Facilities Master Plan\".\" Data is for 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

The editor emeritus is the Rev. Kenneth Baker, S.J.; current editor is the Rev. David Vincent Meconi, S.J., a professor of patristic theology at St. Louis University. Founded over one hundred years ago, \"Homiletic and Pastoral Review\" is one of the most well-respected pastoral journals in the world. The journal is carried by 191 university libraries. It features contributors such as James V. Schall, S.J., Alice von Hildebrand, Paul Vitz, Kenneth Whitehead, Donald DeMarco, Regis Scanlon, and John F. Harvey.\n\nIn 1900 Joseph F. Wagner decided to start a magazine for the Catholic clergy in the U.S.A. He called it \"The Homiletic Monthly and Catechist\", the name it carried until it was changed to the present name in 1919. The format was always simple: each issue included a sample sermon for each Sunday and Feast Day along with some aids for teaching catechism to children. It stayed that way until 1919.\n\nEditor until 1916 was Msgr. John F. Brady of St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, N.Y., the seminary of the Archdiocese of New York. He was succeeded by two Dominican friars, Fathers John A. McHugh, O.P. and Charles J. Callan, O.P. They changed the name of the periodical to \"The Homiletic and Pastoral Review\" (HPR) because they wanted to offer more than sermons. They expanded the scope of HPR, adding articles, official church documents, a \"Questions Answered\" section and book reviews.\n\nTheir tenure was exceptional in the annals of Catholic journalism in the United States. Fr. McHugh was co-editor for 34 years when he died in 1950. Fr. Callan carried on as sole editor until 1957, when Father Adian M. Carr, O.F.M. Conv., started as Associate Editor. Beginning in 1957, Fr. Carr wrote editorials that appear on the last page of every issues; this tradition has remained in place until today.\n\nFr. Callan retired in 1961 and Fr. Carr became the new editor. Callan's tenure had lasted 45 years. In addition to their editorial work, Callan and McHugh founded a parish in Hawthorne, N.Y. and taught at the Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, N.Y.. Both being scholars, they also published 30 books on Scripture and Theology.\n\nIn 1970 Fr. Carr received permission to leave the Franciscans and join the Trappist monks in Monks Corner, S.C. (Within five years he was named Prior of the abbey, and a few years after that he was elected Abbot.) The last issue of \"HPR\" he edited was April 1970. For three months there was no editor until John F. Wagner, president of the company, appointed Msgr. Vincent A. Yzermans of Freeport, Minn., who served as editor until 1971. Fr. Kenneth Baker assumed editorship in April 1971 and remained in this position until 2010.\n\nIn the spring of 2010, Fr. David Vincent Meconi, S.J., became editor of HPR. The journal is currently owned and published by Ignatius Press, which purchased it in 1995.\n\nIn October 2011, it was announced that the print version of the \"Homiletic and Pastoral Review\" would be discontinued at the end of the year. An online version would continue.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806711", "title": "Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms", "text": "Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nSection 2 of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" (\"\"Charter\"\") is the section of the Constitution of Canada that lists what the \"Charter\" calls \"fundamental freedoms\" theoretically applying to everyone in Canada, regardless of whether they are a Canadian citizen, or an individual or corporation. These freedoms can be held against actions of all levels of government and are enforceable by the courts. The fundamental freedoms are freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.\n\nSection 1 of the \"Charter\" permits Parliament or the provincial legislatures to enact laws that place certain kinds of limited restrictions on the freedoms listed under section 2. Additionally, these freedoms can be temporarily invalidated by section 33, the \"notwithstanding clause\", of the \"Charter\".\n\nAs a part of the \"Charter\" and of the larger \"Constitution Act, 1982\", section 2 took legal effect on April 17, 1982. However, many of its rights have roots in Canada in the 1960 \"Canadian Bill of Rights\" (although this law was of limited effectiveness), and in traditions under a theorized Implied Bill of Rights. Many of these exemptions, such as freedom of expression, have also been at the centre of federalistic disputes.\n\nUnder the heading of \"Fundamental Freedoms\" the section states:\nAccording to Beverley McLachlin, freedom of religion in Canada may have originated as early as 1759, when French Canadian Roman Catholics were allowed rights of worship by their British conquerors; this was later reconfirmed in 1774 in the \"Quebec Act\". Later the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" provided for denominational school rights (these are reaffirmed by section 29 of the \"Charter\"). Discussions of church-state relations also took place in the Guibord case of 1874. In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Chaput v Romain\", regarding Jehovah's Witnesses, that different religions have rights, based upon tradition and the rule of law (at the time no statutes formed the basis for this argument).\n\nReligious freedom was later included in the \"Canadian Bill of Rights\". However, its effectiveness was limited. When Sunday closing laws compelling respect for the Christian Sabbath were challenged in \"R v Robertson and Rosetanni\", Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court found that non-Christians merely lost money when denied rights to work on Sunday and were otherwise free to believe in and observe their own religions.\n\nFreedom of religion under section 2(a) of the \"Charter\" was first seriously considered by the Supreme Court in \"R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd\". In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including \"the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination.\" Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements. The immediate consequence of section 2, in this case, was the abolishment of federal Sunday closing laws.\n\nIn \"Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem\", the Supreme Court drew up a definition of freedom of religion under the \"Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms\", mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion. It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority. If courts can believe an individual is telling the truth in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. Following this test in \"Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys\", the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent Sikh student's right to wear a \"kirpan\" (dagger) in school.\n\nIn \"R v NS\", the Supreme Court sought to find a middle ground on the issue of whether a witness can wear a face-covering niqāb while testifying in a criminal trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.\n\nIn addition to freedom of religion, section 2(a) also guarantees freedom of conscience. Professor Peter Hogg speculated this would include a right to atheism, despite the preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which recognizes the \"supremacy of God\". The right has not spawned a great deal of case law, although Justice Bertha Wilson did rely on it in her opinion in \"R v Morgentaler\". Finding laws against abortion to be a breach of the rights to liberty and security of the person under section 7 of the \"Charter\", Wilson then argued this infringement could not be justified as being consistent with fundamental justice. The legal protections found under fundamental justice could be defined as including other rights under the \"Charter\", and in particular abortion laws breached freedom of conscience. As she wrote, the \"decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience\". She then said, \"[C]onscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated are equally protected by freedom of conscience in s. 2(a).\" No other judges joined Wilson's opinion.\n\nJean Chrétien, who was the attorney general during negotiations of the \"Charter\", later recalled in his memoirs that freedom of conscience was nearly excluded from the \"Charter\". The federal and provincial negotiators found the right too difficult to define, and Chrétien eventually agreed to remove it. A legal advisor for the federal government, Pierre Genest, then kicked Chrétien's chair, prompting Chrétien to joke, \"I guess we leave it in. Trudeau's spy just kicked me in the ass.\"\n\nFreedom of expression, section 2(b), is perhaps one of the most significant \"Charter\" rights in influencing Canadian society. The right is expressly named in the charter because although \"Canadian criminal law uses the standard of the reasonable person as a ... definition for the threshold of criminality\", the \"Charter\" expressly limits some forms of expression. Justice Peter Cory wrote that it \"is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society\". The section has been at the centre of a great amount of case law.\n\nFreedom of speech had a limited background in Canada. It has been an issue in federalism disputes, as provincial legislation infringing upon free speech has been taken as criminal legislation, which only the Parliament of Canada can validly create under section 91(27) of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\". \"Switzman v Elbling\" is an example of a case in which this was discussed. An Implied Bill of Rights theory further stated governments were limited in their abilities to infringe upon free speech by virtue of the preamble of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\". This preamble states Canada's constitution would be based upon Britain's, and Britain had limited free speech in 1867. Furthermore, free speech is considered to be necessary for a parliamentary government to function.\n\nFree speech was later included in the \"Canadian Bill of Rights\".\n\nThe meaning of \"expression\" within section 2(b) has been read broadly as including any activity that conveys, or attempts to convey, meaning to the exception of acts of violence and threats of violence. However, the Courts have tried to maintain content neutrality by not considering the value of the expression. Instead, the content is only examined during the section 1 analysis.\n\nFreedom of expression is primarily seen as a negative right. In \"Native Women's Association of Canada v Canada\", the Court considered a claim that the government had to financially support an interest group in constitutional negotiations, as it had supported others. Section 28 (sexual equality under the \"Charter\") was used to reinforce this argument, since the rights claimants were an interest group. Still, while the Supreme Court agreed discussions with the government is \"unquestionably\" a form of expression, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing any expression and thus the claim was dismissed.\n\nA law will be found to violate the freedom of expression where the law either has the purpose or effect of violating the right.\n\nA law's purpose can limit the right either through limiting the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where the meaning of the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation. Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often have the effect of limiting the content as well.\n\nWhere a law does not intend to limit the freedom of expression it may still infringe section 2(b) through its effects. A law will be found to restrict expression if it has the effect of frustrating \"the pursuit of truth, participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing\".\n\nCommercial expression is recognized as an activity protected under section 2(b). This includes advertising and any other similar means of expression used to sell goods and services. In fact, even false or misleading advertising is protected. The value of the expression does not come into play until the section 1 analysis.\n\nThe protection of commercial expression was first established in \"Ford v Quebec (AG)\", where the Court struck down a Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by \"Irwin Toy\", where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also found that restrictions on advertising by professionals to be protected. As well, even communications for the purpose of prostitution was found to be protected as commercial expression.\n\nProtesting by labour groups and trade unions have long been recognized as a protected form of expression.\n\nThere are not many instances of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate has been over whether secondary picketing can be restricted; the practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute has in the past been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is \"British Columbia Government Employees' Union v British Columbia (AG)\", where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.\n\nSection 2(b) guarantees freedom of thought, belief and opinion in addition to freedom of expression. However, some have argued that freedoms of thought, belief and opinion in the \"Charter\" have had little practical consequence, and question whether governments have the capacity to stifle unspoken thoughts in any case.\n\nThe need to protect freedom of expression is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals. In \" Crookes v. Newton\", for example, the Supreme Court of Canada found that section 2(b) must be considered in determining the extent to which common law libel restrictions should apply to new technologies such as internet hyperlinks.\n\nFreedom of peaceful assembly under section 2(c) has not had a major impact on the case law. In \"Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)\", the Supreme Court found that despite being written as a separate right, it was closely related to freedom of expression. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court defined it in \"Fraser et al v AGNS et al\" (1986) as including rights to meet as part of a committee or as workers. If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions on being able to spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly. In 2011, Occupy Canada's protests in public parks raised questions of whether their eviction was prohibited by freedom of assembly, as well as expression and association.\n\nFreedom of association is guaranteed under section 2(d). This right provides individuals the right to establish, belong to and maintain to any sort of organization, unless that organization is otherwise illegal. Generally, this is used in the labour context where employees are given the right to associate with certain unions or other similar group to represent their interests in labour disputes or negotiations.\n\nIt is important to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves. Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in the landmark \"Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v British Columbia\", the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. The Court ruled in this case that legislation that \"substantially interferes\" with the process of collective bargaining is a section 2(d) infringement. The test for \"substantial interference\" is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the collective right to good faith negotiation and consultation. It is not certain whether the decision in \"Health Services\" overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called \"labour trilogy\" cases of 1987 which found that section 2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.\n\nThe Supreme Court has since found in \"Ontario (AG) v Fraser\", that the right to collective bargaining does not require government to take an active role in promoting and fostering collective bargaining, but merely to refrain from excessive interference with the collective bargaining process. In effect, the right to collective bargaining \"guarantees a process, not a result\". \"Fraser\" was affirmed and expanded upon by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 2012 in \"Association of Justice Counsel v Canada (AG)\".\n\nTypically, where a union is denied a right it does not preclude the employees from forming a separate association. In \"Delisle v Canada (Deputy AG)\", members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were excluded from the public services legislation. The Supreme Court held that they were not precluded from forming their own association outside of the impugned legislation. However, in contrast the decision of \"Dunmore v Ontario (AG)\" indicated that agricultural workers who were excluded from provincial labour relations legislation were entitled to be included because individually they were unable to form their own associations, and consequently, this imposed a duty upon the government to include them.\n\nThe freedom of association also includes the freedom not to associate. In certain employment circumstances, employees are required to contribute to a union as conditions of their employment (see Rand formula). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In \"Lavigne\", the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes \"ideological conformity\". Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under section 1, resulting in a right not to associate that has more theoretical than practical effects.\n\nIn \"Advance Cutting & Coring\", the Supreme Court was called to examine the constitutional validity of a Quebec law that required all persons working in the province's construction industry to join a designated union. Eight of nine judges (Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé dissenting) confirmed that section 2 includes, to at least some degree, the negative right to \"not\" associate. With a majority of five judges to four, the Court determined that the law at issue violated this right. But with the same majority (judge Frank Iacobucci \"switching camps\" on the two issues and citing a \"unique and complex historical context\" in Quebec), the Court deemed the law to be \"justified in a free and democratic society\" under section 1 and thus constitutional.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806737", "title": "Czech and Slovak Federative Republic", "text": "Czech and Slovak Federative Republic\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in late-1989, Czechoslovakia adopted the official name Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (, ; ČSFR) during the period from 23 April 1990 until 31 December 1992, when the country was dissolved into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nSince 1960, Czechoslovakia's official name had been the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (\"Československá socialistická republika\", ČSSR). In the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution, newly elected President Václav Havel announced that \"Socialist\" would be dropped from the country's official name.\n\nConventional wisdom suggested that the country would resume the name used from 1919 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1960, Czechoslovak Republic (\"Československá republika\"). However, Slovak politicians objected that the traditional name subsumed Slovakia's equal status in the federal state too much. The first compromise was Constitutional Law 81/1990, which changed the country's name to Czechoslovak Federative Republic (, ; \"ČSFR\"), explicitly acknowledging the federal nature of the state. It was passed on 29 March 1990 (coming into force on the same day) only after an informal agreement on the Slovak form which would be explicitly codified by a future law on state symbols. This was met with general disapproval and another round of haggling, dubbed \"the hyphen war\" (\"pomlčková válka/vojna\") after Slovaks' wish to insert a hyphen into the name (\"Česko-Slovensko\"). However, aggrieved Czechs vehemently opposed it as too reminiscent of such practice during the \"Second Republic\" (when the official name was \"Czecho-Slovak Republic\"—which had also been used from 1938 to 1939)—when the country had been mutilated by the Munich Agreement and was slipping toward its final dismemberment at the hands of Nazi Germany a year later. The resultant compromise, after much behind-the-scenes negotiation, was Constitutional Law 101/1990, passed on 20 April and in force since its declaration on 23 April. The law changed the country's name to \"Czech and Slovak Federative Republic\"; unlike the previous one, it also explicitly listed both versions and stated they were equal.\n\nThe name breaks the rules of Czech and Slovak orthography, which do not use capitalization for proper names' second and further words (see above), nor adjectives derived from them. Thus the correct form would be \"Česká a slovenská federat... republika.\" However, \"Česká a Slovenská F. R.\" was adopted in hopes of eliminating any debate about the prestige of Slovakia. While few people were happy with the name, it came into use quickly. Czech and Slovak tensions, of which this was an early sign, soon became manifest in matters of greater immediate importance which made the country's name a comparatively minor issue and at the same time even more impossible to change, so the name remained.\n\nThe 1960 Constitution remained in force on an interim basis. However, it was heavily amended to prune out its Communist character. Work on a permanent constitution was still underway at the time of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806743", "title": "Mack Brown", "text": "Mack Brown\n\nWilliam Mack Brown (born August 27, 1951) is an American college football coach. He is currently in his second stint as the head football coach at the University of North Carolina, where he coached from 1988 until departing in 1997 to become coach at the University of Texas. He was recently a college football commentator for ESPN. In January 2018, Brown was selected to enter the College Football Hall of Fame. In November 2018, Brown took the vacant job at North Carolina, replacing Larry Fedora.\n\nPrior to his head coach position at Texas, Brown was head coach at Appalachian State, Tulane, and North Carolina. Brown is credited with revitalizing the Texas and North Carolina football programs. The Longhorns beat the University of Southern California in the 2006 Rose Bowl, Ohio State at The Horseshoe in September 2005, and conference rival Oklahoma in 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2013. The 2005 season was capped off by victories over Colorado and USC to win the Big 12 Conference and national championships, respectively. In 2006, he was awarded the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award for \"Coach of the Year\". Brown achieved his 200th career win during the 2008 season, making him the first Texas coach to reach that mark. He resigned after the 2013 Alamo Bowl.\n\nBrown was born as the middle of three boys (brothers Mel and Watson) on August 27, 1951, in Cookeville, Tennessee. During his teenage years, he attended Putnam County High School. Brown's family had a long history with football. His grandfather, Eddie Watson, was an athlete at Tennessee Tech and a coach at Putnam County High School for more than three decades. His father, Melvin Brown, was also a coach and an administrator. Mack's older brother Watson also coached, and was the head football coach at a total of six Division I football schools, ending his career with their hometown school, Tennessee Tech. Mack attended Vanderbilt University before attending Florida State University and graduating in 1974. He later received a graduate degree from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1976. During his undergraduate years, Brown was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.\n\nBrown was a three-sport star at Putnam County High School, playing football, basketball and baseball. After his senior season, he won All-State as well as Prep All-America honors and was selected one of the nation's top running backs by Scholastic Magazine his senior year. The Tennessean selected him as the state player of the year.\n\nHe accepted a football scholarship to Vanderbilt University., where his brother Watson Brown was the starting quarterback. In his time playing for the Vanderbilt Commodores, he played for Bill Pace and rushed 82 times for 364 yards and three touchdowns, as well as catching seven passes for 50 yards and a touchdown during the 1970 season.\n\nBrown then transferred to Florida State University. Brown played for Florida State under head coach Larry Jones. At Florida State he had 31 rushing attempts for 98 yards and 10 catches for 76 yards with no touchdowns in the 1972 season. Lettering twice as a running back for the Seminoles, he started his coaching career as a student coach after five knee surgeries ended his career prematurely.\n\nBrown's first experience coaching came as a student coach of wide receivers at Florida State, a position he held in 1973 and 1974. From 1975 to 1977, he was the wide receivers coach at Southern Miss. This was followed by a one-year stint as wide receivers coach at Memphis State.\n\nFor the 1979 season, he joined the staff of Iowa State, again as a wide receivers coach, before a promotion to offensive coordinator. In 1980, after going 3–8 the year prior, Iowa State improved their record to 6–5 in large part due to running back Dwayne Crutchfield (1,312 yards with 11 TD) and the rest of Brown's offense. The team scored 108 more points that year than they had in 1979. In 1981, the team finished with a 5–5–1 record, despite starting out with a record of 5–1–1. RB Dwayne Crutchfield was again a key focal point in Brown's offense and ran for 1,189 yards with 17 TD.\n\nIn 1982, Brown moved to LSU as the quarterbacks coach. The LSU Tigers improved their record to 8–3–1 from 3–7–1 the year prior in large part due to Brown's coaching of quarterback Alan Risher, who threw for 1,834 yards with 17 TD and 8 INT. He also completed 63.7% of his pass attempts. Risher had thrown 14 TD in the previous two seasons combined before Brown's arrival.\n\nBrown's first head coaching job came in 1983 when he led Appalachian State to a 6–5 record. In December 1983, he was seriously considered for the head coaching position at LSU which had been vacated after Jerry Stovall was fired, but the position instead went to Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger.\n\nBrown moved back to a role as offensive coordinator for the Oklahoma Sooners during the 1984 season under head coach Barry Switzer. Oklahoma would run for 2,376 yards as a team that season, averaging 216 yards a game. QB Danny Bradley also would throw for nearly 1,000 yards with 8 TD vs 5 INT. RBs Lydell Carr, Steve Sewell, and Spencer Tillman combined to run for 1,651 yards with 12 TD.\n\nBrown's second head coaching position came with Tulane in 1985, where he also became the school's athletic director in the wake of a point shaving scandal which led to the shutdown of the men's basketball program. Despite a slow start (a 1–10 record in his first year), he made gradual improvement, leading the Green Wave to a 4–7 record in 1986 and, in 1987, to a 6–6 record and a trip to the Independence Bowl, Tulane's fifth bowl game in over 40 years and last until 1998.\n\nIn 1988, Brown was named the head coach at North Carolina. Brown's first two teams finished with identical 1–10 records, the worst two seasons that the Tar Heels have suffered on the field in modern times. However, the next two years saw a relatively quick return to respectability. In 1990, the Tar Heels finished 6–4–1. By comparison, the Tar Heels had won only seven games in the previous three years. Included in the 1990 total was a tie of Georgia Tech that proved to be the Yellow Jackets' only non-win that season en route to a share of the national championship. In 1991, the Tar Heels finished 7–4, narrowly missing a bowl bid.\n\nEverything finally came together for the Tar Heels in 1992. They finished 8–3 in the regular season and second in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and with a victory over Mississippi State in the Peach Bowl, they finished the season at 9–3. The Peach Bowl was the program's first bowl appearance since 1986 and their first bowl win since 1982. They also notched their first appearance in a final Top 25 poll since 1982.\n\nThe 1992 season was the start of UNC's most successful period since the Charlie Justice era in the late 1940s. Brown coached the Tar Heels to five consecutive bowl games, including UNC's only two New Year's Day bowl games in more than half a century (or three, if one counts the 1992–93 Peach Bowl, which was played the day after New Year's to avoid a conflict with the Sugar Bowl). They were ranked in the AP Top 25 every week from October 1992 through the start of the 1995 season. They finished in the final rankings in four out of five years, including two straight appearances in the top 10. They also won 10 regular-season games in 1993 and 1997, only the second and third times the Tar Heels have accomplished this. Largely due to Florida State joining the league in 1992, Brown was unable to win an ACC title—something the Tar Heels haven't done since 1980.\n\nBrown's time at UNC also saw renewed popularity for a team that had long played in the shadow of the school's powerhouse basketball team. Games at Kenan Memorial Stadium were almost always sold out, the highlight being a standing-room only crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.\n\nNot long after the end of the 1997 season, Brown accepted the head coaching job at Texas. His defensive coordinator, Carl Torbush, coached the Tar Heels in that year's Gator Bowl. North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and the Gator Bowl to Torbush.\n\nIn his early years at UT, Brown was referred to as \"Coach February,\" due to his success in bringing in high talent recruits. His detractors felt that with all the resources at his disposal at Texas, combined with the talent he was recruiting from high school programs, that he should have more to show for it than appearances in the Holiday Bowl or Cotton Bowl Classic. They felt that he should be playing for Big 12 titles or even National Championships instead.\n\nIn five of the first seven seasons under Brown, the Longhorns were all but eliminated from either of these two goals due to losses in October to Big 12 rival Oklahoma. Since the two teams played in the same division of the Big 12, a loss by Texas to Oklahoma meant that Texas could not win the south division of the conference unless Oklahoma lost at least two conference games. However, in 1999 Brown led Texas to their second Big 12 title game where they were beaten by a higher ranked Nebraska team that they had beaten earlier in the year. In 2001, Brown took Texas to their 3rd Big 12 title game. In that year's campaign, the Longhorns lost to the Sooners, but were given another chance when the Sooners lost to both Nebraska and Oklahoma State. Texas lost the Big 12 Championship Game to Colorado, a school they had beaten by a substantial margin earlier in the year. Many felt that Texas would have played in the BCS Championship game had they beaten Colorado. A similar opportunity presented itself in 2002. After Oklahoma beat Texas, they lost to Texas A&M and Oklahoma State. However, Texas suffered a loss to Texas Tech, so they did not make the championship game.\n\nIn 2003, Texas finished the regular season with a 10–2 regular season record, and most observers felt they had the resume to reach their first BCS bowl under Brown. However, when South Champion (and #1 ranked) Oklahoma lost to North Champion Kansas State in the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State received the Big 12 Conference's automatic BCS bid as conference champion and joined Oklahoma in the BCS. The BCS rules specified that no more than two teams from a single conference could receive bids. Texas was frozen out.\n\nAlthough Brown consistently led the Longhorns to a bowl game to cap off each season in his first six years, he was not able to lead them to a Bowl Championship Series game, having to settle each year for the Holiday Bowl or Cotton Bowl Classic. His record in these games was 3–3, with two of the three losses coming at the hands of supposedly inferior teams as judged by the rankings headed into the games.\n\nIn 2004, the Longhorns began the season with a #7 ranking nationally and had risen to #5 coming into the annual matchup with then #2 Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout. Oklahoma shutout the Longhorns 12–0. Texas dropped to #9, before rebounding with wins over #24 Missouri, 28–20, at #24 Texas Tech, 51–21, and at Colorado, 31–7. Then Texas set a record for the largest come from-behind-win in school history, beating #19 Oklahoma State, 56–35, after falling behind 35–7. After this performance, Texas again fell behind against Kansas, but squeaked out a win 27–23. Kansas head coach Mark Mangino stirred up controversy by claiming that the officials were biased in favor of Texas because the conference wanted a second team in a BCS bowl game and Texas was in position to gain an at-large BCS bid. The series of victories brought Texas back up to #5 in the rankings as they welcomed arch-rival Texas A&M to Austin and won 26–13. However, Oklahoma stood undefeated, which meant the Sooners would represent the Big 12 South in the championship game against a much lower ranked team from the North Division. Once again, the loss to Oklahoma had kept Texas out of playing for a national or conference title, and had seemingly destined them to a non-BCS bowl as well.\n\nWith Texas and California both vying for a spot in the Rose Bowl, Brown received criticism for lobbying on behalf of his team, which many perceived was a factor in UT's Rose Bowl invitation. Cal was denied what would have been their first Rose Bowl bid since 1958. \"I thought it was a little classless how Coach Brown was begging for votes,\" Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers told reporters in Berkeley. \"I think a team's record and the way you play should speak for itself.\" Cal's only loss was a 23–17 nailbiter on the road at USC. Cal dominated the game statistically, more than doubling USC in total yardage. The Golden Bears had a first-and-goal from the 9-yard-line with roughly one minute left in the fourth quarter, but could not convert. Meanwhile, Texas' lone loss was a 12–0 defeat to Oklahoma on a neutral field. USC and Oklahoma, the teams Cal and Texas lost to, respectively, went on to play in the national championship. USC blew out Oklahoma 55–19 in that game. However, Texas fans point to the Holiday Bowl, where Cal was dealt a 45–31 loss at the hands of No. 23 Texas Tech, a team which Texas defeated 51–21 earlier in the season.\n\nBrown's Longhorns accepted the bid to play in the Rose Bowl. It was the first visit by the Longhorns, due mainly to the fact that the Rose Bowl traditionally pitted the winner of the Pac-10 against the winner of the Big Ten. Texas' opponent was Michigan, whom Texas was playing for the very first time. Texas won the game, 38–37, on a last second field goal by kicker Dusty Mangum in what had been called one of the greatest Rose Bowl games of all time. Despite the success of the 2004 season, Coach Brown's resume was still lacking both a conference championship and a national championship.\n\nTexas opened the season ranked #2 behind USC in every preseason poll. Led by quarterback Vince Young, Texas defeated their early opponents easily, including a decisive 45–12 victory over Oklahoma. That marked the 6th time the Longhorns entered the contest ranked 2nd nationally, and they have won all six times. With the win, Texas started the season 5–0 for the first time since 1983. That season was the last time UT had national title hopes, when they ended the regular season 11–0 before losing to Georgia in the Cotton Bowl Classic.\n\nAfter a win over previously undefeated Texas Tech, Texas moved into first place in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings for the first time since its creation. However, the following week Texas fell back down to #2 in the BCS poll, while USC moved back into the #1 spot. Both teams won all their remaining games, with USC and Texas remaining ranked #1 and #2 throughout the rest of the regular season.\n\nThe two teams finally met in the BCS National Championship Game at the 2006 Rose Bowl in a highly anticipated matchup. Texas and USC were the only two unbeaten NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) teams (Auburn was also undefeated in 2004), and the game marked the first time two teams averaging over 50 points per game had met. The combined 53-game win streak was an NCAA record for teams playing each other and the game was also the first to have teams ranked first and second in every iteration of the BCS standings. The game also featured USC's two Heisman winners (Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart) as well as a Heisman finalist in Vince Young. In an up and down game, Texas eventually defeated USC 41-38, highlighted by a 4th and 5 touchdown run and 2 point conversion by Vince Young in the final minute, giving the longhorns their first national championship in 34 years.\n\nAfter defeating USC the year before in the BCS Championship game to finish with the undisputed #1 ranking, Texas began the 2006 season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman Colt McCoy. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State in the second game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) to climb into the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12–7, to intrastate rival Texas A&M. The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6–6 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.\n\nMack Brown entered his 10th season as the head coach of the Texas Longhorns with a record of 93–22 setting a new mark above 0.8 winning percentage (.809), the best in Longhorn history. The 2007 Texas Longhorns football team began play ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage, and were ranked in the Top 10 by numerous pre-season polls.\n\nDespite expectations, prior to and during the season a total of seven UT players were suspended for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated a great deal of negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.\n\nFor the second straight year, UT merchandise were the top-selling products among buyers of Collegiate Licensing Company. UT used part of the money to give Mack Brown a raise: the University of Texas Board of Regents voted unanimously to raise Brown's salary by $300,000, bringing his annual compensation to $2.81 million and keeping him among the five highest paid coaches in the sport. The package also contained provisions for up to $3 million in bonuses, including \"$100,000 if he wins the Big 12 Championship and $450,000 if he wins this year's national championship, as well as bonuses based on the percent of players who graduate.\" Brown's contract was extended through the 2016 season and includes buy-out clauses should another school attempt to hire Brown.\n\nFor the football season, Texas won their first four games although three of them were closer than analysts had expected. In their next game Texas was beaten for a second year in a row by the Kansas State Wildcats 41–21 through play with no turnovers and 21  combined points from defense and special teams. The Kansas State Wildcats scored one touchdown on a punt return, one on a kick return, and one on an interception; Previously, Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season. The 41 points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66–3 loss in 1997, and it was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas. Texas lost again the following week in the 2007 Red River Shootout, 28–21. With that loss, Texas opened conference play 0–2 for the first time since 1956, when they were in the Southwest Conference and one year before Darrell Royal became head coach of the Longhorns. But that was as bad as it got for Mack Brown during the first decade of the 21st century. In their ninth regular season game, Texas outscored Nebraska 28–25, marking Brown's 100th win at Texas. In their next two games, the Longhorns would defeat Oklahoma State and Texas Tech, but in their final matchup against archrival Texas A&M, the Longhorns lost 30–38. This marked the Longhorns' second straight loss to the Aggies. Despite the loss, Texas went to the Holiday Bowl to defeat 11th-ranked Arizona State 52–34. The Longhorns finished the season 10–3, marking their seventh consecutive 10-win season, the third longest of all time in FBS history, trailing Florida State's 14 from 1987–00 and Miami's 8 from 1985–92.\n\nThe 2008 Texas Longhorns football team entered the season ranked 10th in the USA Today Coaches Poll. They won their first four games to rise to number 5 in the national rankings. Texas began Big 12 Conference play on October 4, 2008 with a trip to Boulder, Colorado and a win over the Colorado Buffaloes. On October 11, 2008 they defeated the number-one ranked Oklahoma Sooners in the 103rd Red River Shootout. It was the third UT win in four seasons, and the first time in Brown's tenure for either team to upset the other in the Red River Shootout.<ref name=\"TX/ou recap\"></ref>\n\nFollowing the victory over OU, the Longhorns vaulted up the standings to first place in the AP, ESPN/USA Today, and Harris Polls. In their next game they secured a win over #11 Missouri in Austin, setting a new school, state, and conference attendance record in the process. It was the first time since 1977 for the Longhorns to play a home football game as the #1 team in the AP. Texas' reign at the top of the BCS standings was soon brought to an end; however, by the then seventh-ranked Red Raiders of Texas Tech. In a game played before a record-setting national television audience on November 1, 2008, the Longhorns, who trailed the entire game, took the lead with one minute and twenty-eight seconds remaining on the clock. Texas Tech then scored a comeback touchdown with one second remaining to win the game 39–33, keeping Texas out of the Big 12 Championship Game and national title pictures. Texas finished the 2008 regular season with a win over Texas A&M, the Longhorns' longest-running rivalry opponent. The biggest margin of victory in the history of the series occurred when Texas beat A&M 48–0 in 1898. Texas nearly equaled that record in 2008 by producing a 49–9 victory, the second-largest margin of victory for this rivalry series. It was also the 200th career win for Mack Brown, and it set a new attendance record for UT, the State of Texas, the Big 12 Conference, and the southwest region. Texas would go on to win the 2009 Fiesta Bowl by beating Ohio State, 24–21.\n\nIn 2009, Texas went undefeated in the regular season to win the Big 12 South Division. They defeated Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game to earn a berth in the national title game against Alabama. QB Colt McCoy was injured early in the game and did not return, leaving the offense in the hands of inexperienced true freshman Garrett Gilbert. Alabama was able to take advantage and won. Brown would coach the Longhorns for four more seasons. However, the teams would not match the success of the previous years. In 2010, the team had a losing record and did not play in a bowl game for the first and only time under Brown. On December 14, 2013, he announced his resignation as Texas' Head Coach effective following that season's bowl game.\n\nOn November 27, 2018, Brown was named head coach at North Carolina after a 5-year absence from coaching and 21 years after he left UNC for Texas. In his first game coaching in 6 years and first game as North Carolina's coach in 22 years, the Tar Heels upset the South Carolina Gamecocks in Charlotte 24-20. Coincidentally his very first game as North Carolina's coach in 1988 came against South Carolina. In the home opener a week later, the Tar Heels defeated the Miami Hurricanes on a last-minute touchdown. Two weeks later, they nearly upset #1 ranked and defending national champion Clemson, but what would have been the go-ahead two-point conversion failed. It proved to be the only close game Clemson had in the regular season.\n\nThe following week, Brown's Tar Heels defeated Georgia Tech 38-22. It was Brown's 72nd win with the Tar Heels, tying Dick Crum as the winningest coach in school history. He broke the record two weeks later with a 20-17 victory over Duke. On November 30th, UNC defeated NC State 41-10 to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2016. They then routed Temple 55-13 in the Military Bowl.\n\nSince returning to Chapel Hill, Brown has started a tradition of lighting the Bell Tower Carolina blue after every home win. This was carried over from his tenure at Texas, when The Tower was lit burnt orange after every Longhorn win.\n\n9-32 record versus the AP Top Ten\n\nMack Brown's wife is named Sally. They have four children: Matt Jessee, Katherine Ryan, Barbara Wilson, and Chris Jessee.\n\nIn Austin, Mack and Sally continue to be active in community affairs, serving as honorary co-chairpersons of the Capital Campaign for the Helping Hands of Austin. They have also been instrumental in the opening of The Rise School of Austin (an early childhood education program that integrates children who have disabilities with their typically developing peers) and serve on the school's Board of Directors. They lent their name along with legendary UT QB James Street to the First Annual James Street/Mack Brown Golf Tournament benefiting The Rise School. The Browns have endorsed a new Texas license plate, which is designed to raise public awareness for child abuse and neglect, and the need for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers. After the Aggie Bonfire tragedy at Texas A&M in 1999, the couple initiated a blood drive on the UT campus that attracted more than 250 blood donors. Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell pronounced January 30, 2014, \"Mack and Sally Brown Day\" in honor of the many contributions the Browns had made to the city of Austin during Mack's time as head coach of the Longhorns.\n\nIn October 2006, Mack Brown made a cameo appearance in the television pilot for \"Friday Night Lights\". Early in the show, a resident is heard to say \"Who does <nowiki>[</nowiki>Coach Taylor<nowiki>]</nowiki> think he is? Mack Brown? He's no Mack Brown.\" Later in the pilot, the real Mack Brown plays the role of a local football booster quizzing high school coach Eric Taylor on his pre-game preparation. Brown also appears in commercials for \"College GameDay\" where he sings \"Texas Fight\" with the \"GameDay\" crew; when Kirk Herbstreit freestyles the song, Brown looks at Herbstreit sternly and says \"We don't freestyle 'Texas Fight', big boy.\"\n\nIn 2009 Brown's annual salary was increased to $5 million (excluding bonuses and incentives), a raise of about $2 million. The raise created controversy on the UT campus during a time when academic programs were facing significant cutbacks. On December 14, 2009, the UT faculty council held a special meeting to consider the following resolution:\n\n\"We appreciate the contributions of the athletic staff and, especially, the student-athletes, to the community of the University of Texas at Austin. However, at a time when students are facing a deteriorating academic environment in the form of declining class offerings and increasing class sizes, and lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff are facing job terminations, we believe a permanent raise of $2 million (a sum greater than the entire career earnings of a typical university employee) offered to any member of the university community is unseemly and inappropriate.\"\n\nAssistant coaches under Brown who later became NFL head coaches include:\n\nAssistant coaches under Brown who later became NCAA Division I head coaches include:\n\n"}

He may have been baptised in Shorwell on 24 December 1725.\n\nA convicted smuggler, Henday joined the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1750 as a net-maker and labourer. \n\nFrom the 1600s to the late 1800s the HBC had the exclusive fur trade for the land within what was considered Hudson Bay's watershed. This region was known as Rupert's Land. For the furs that HBC was after they wanted to trade commodities such as tobacco, kettles, axes, mirrors, beads, and alcohol.\n\nBecause of the HBC's concern with La Vérendrye and the other western commanders who were funnelling fur trade from the northwest to their forts, Eventually, James Isham, chief at York Fort, suggested someone go to western Rupert's Land to encourage trade with the region's First Nations tribes. The HBC authorized and funded Henday to lead explorations into the interior of Rupert's Land, using York Factory as his base. On June 26, 1754, he set out with a group of Cree Indians on foot to travel from York Factory to present-day Red Deer, Alberta. It is documented they passed the French Fort Paskoya where he may have met La Corne, the western commander.\n\nOn September 10, 1754 Henday and his party camped approximately eighteen miles north-east of where Chauvin is located today, quite possibly at Sherlock Lake. The following day, Wednesday, September 11, 1754 he crossed over from Saskatchewan into present-day Alberta. However, he did not arrive at Waskesew River until Friday, October 11, 1754. \"Waskesew\" is a mistranslation of the Cree word for elk. The Cree in the Red Deer area call the central Alberta city Waskesew Ceepee. Instead of Red Deer the city might well be called Elk River. In October 1754 he and his group came to what is now Alberta with a mission to meet the Blackfoot and perhaps trade with them.\n\nHenday may not have been aware that the Blackfoot and the Cree were arch enemies. There is some indication in Henday's journal entries that the Cree were becoming wary of the other tribes Henday and his Cree companions were encountering. While the group was travelling in what Henday refers to the \"Muscuty plains\" they come across a man named \"Attickasish with 2 Archithinue Natives (Blackfeet)\". He says these Indians had never been in contact with any Europeans and his Cree travelling companions were afraid of them. Then on Monday, October 14, 1754 Archithinue Natives on horse back approached them and ask them if they were friend or foe. That evening Henday and his guide met and smoked with the Leader of the Archithinue Natives. Henday offered to have some of the Archithinues go back with them back to York Factory. The Archithinue Leader did not readily answer Henday and the Leader went on to say that they (Archithinue) could not paddle and the it (York Factory) was too far. The Leader of the Archithinue, probably, knew that his men would be travelling uninvited in Cree territory and would risk being killed off by the Cree and other enemy tribes. After receiving an indefinite answer from the Blackfoot (which Henday took as a \"no\"), Henday returned to York Factory with news he had explored the area and met with the Blackfoot. Since the answer had been unsure, there were no more expeditions to what would eventually be Alberta until Peter Fidler in 1792.\n\nAs Henday travelled inland to the Blackfoot country and back to York Factory, he talked about the Indians having some problems with alcohol. He mentions on one day that his whole company was unable to travel because everyone was drinking. On Friday, 30 May 1755 Henday remarks in his journal that he is unable to continue their travels back to York Factory because \"the Indians drank too much\" but they were using their best furs to trade with the French for the alcohol.\n\nThis trip, and later ones, took Henday across much of the prairies of what are now Saskatchewan and Alberta. Although his journal cannot always be put in a modern context, it is evident he brought much trade to York Factory. Records show some of the trade also went to the French at Fort Saint-Louis (Fort de la Corne) and Fort Paskoya which were on the route to Hudson Bay. He left the service of the HBC in 1762 largely because his efforts for the company, at least in his estimation, had not been properly recognized.\n\nAnthony Henday Drive, a large ring road in Edmonton, is named in his honour, as is Henday Hall, one of the residence towers in the main student residence complex at the University of Alberta in that city.\n\n"}

He took part in the Pakistan-India Forum for Peace and Democracy, and was a member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. A free-thinker, he founded Enlightenment, an organization associated with the IHEU.\n\nIn October 2000, Pakistani authorities charged Shaikh with blasphemy. A judge ordered that he pay a fine of 100,000 rupees, and sentenced him to death by hanging. On appeal, on 20 November 2003, a court acquitted Shaikh, who fled Pakistan for Europe soon thereafter.\n\nYounes M. Shaikh is a qualified medical doctor who was arrested under Pakistani Blasphemy Law 295/C merely on the accusation of being an Ahmadi and yet talking about Islam and the Prophet of Islam, which the Ahmadis are not allowed to; although he was a born Muslim and not an Ahmadi only that he strongly felt that the Ahmadis were wrongfully persecuted, and so he wrote letters about this to authorities in Pakistan, the foreign embassies in Islamabad; to members of the United Nations and to human rights organizations all over the world; he was a member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad. Dr. Younes M SHEIKH was born on 30 May 1952 in Chishtian, Pakistan. He studied and qualified as a medical doctor in Multan. In Dublin and London, he did post-graduate studies and worked as a trainee surgeon there from 1981 to 1988. After graduation as a doctor, he worked in Lahore, Pakistan for a few years. He also took membership of Human Rights organisations like Amnesty International and SCCL, NCCL. On his return to Pakistan, he worked at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, practised as a general medical practitioner, then taught at Capital Medical College, G/9 Markaz Islamabad Islamabad.\n\nShaikh studied Journalism in his free time and attained a diploma in Journalism from Islamabad. He was active in intellectual, literary and social circles and he regularly attended the meetings of the Halqa Arbab i Zoaq in Lahore and later in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. He was an active member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in Islamabad. Shaikh attracted the attention of Islamic fundamentalists because he had protested against the abuse of loudspeakers from mosques which caused pain and discomfort to babies, children, and his clinic patients. He often spoke out against extremist Islamic mullahs and their atrocities; particularly against one of his Ahmadi medical friends whose clinics and houses in Burewala were burnt down. As a member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, he wrote letters to President Musharraf and different newspapers about Islamic attacks on Ahmadis. He also campaigned for the human rights of women, of Hindus, Christians, and liberal, secular Muslims. He also spoke about 1971 civil war and crimes against Bengalis. He also expressed disquiet and exposed the horrors of the Pakistan Army atrocities in Bengal in 1971, and the role of Islamism, mosques, mullahs and Islamic fundamentalists belonging to Jamaat-e-Islami and its students wing Islami Jamiiat Tulaba, and Al-Shamas, Al-Badar the Islamic extremists in Bengal mass murders. In response rumors were spread against him to put doubt about his mental balance: as for example, that he might be the son of the female Prime Minister of Pakistan's enemy country, India; that he might be an apostate and Ahmadi and so worthy of punishment and death. Among other activities he founded an organization The Enlightenment active for literacy, an organization associated with the International Humanist and Ethical Union, in 1990.\n\nShaikh's blasphemy was alleged to have occurred at a lecture he gave on 2 October 2000 at Capital Medical College. The accusation was that he was an Ahmadi and talked about Islam and recited the Quran. That, during the lecture, Shaikh talked about Prophet Muhammad which was not allowed to Ahmadis.\n\nShaikh denied that this lecture even took place, and denied that he had said what was alleged. In a letter to Babu Gogineni of the IHEU, Shaikh offered an explanation of why a charge was made against him; he claimed (albeit without corroborating evidence against the people he accused):\n\nShaukat Qadir denied that he had threatened Shaikh at the meeting.\nAccording to press reports, eleven students, all the students in Shaikh's class, signed a letter attesting to Shaikh's blasphemy. The cleric who received the letter was a member of an organisation known to harass and to attack non-orthodox Muslims. The reports call the organisation Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-e-Nubuwwat, which the press translates as the Committee for the Protection of the Finality of the Prophethood, or the Movement for the Finality of the Prophet, or the Organisation of the Finality of the Prophet. Pakistan said that Shaikh's accuser was the head of Majlis-e-Khatam-e-Nabuwwat. That organisation dispatched a mob to the medical school and to the police station, and threatened to burn them down if action was not urgently taken against Shaikh. Capital Homeopathic College, without explanation, suspended Shaikh on 3 October 2000.\n\nSection 295C of Pakistan's Penal Code says \"whoever by the words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad shall be punished with the death sentence or imprisonment for life and shall be liable to fine.\" A charge under Section 295C requires that the accused be kept in custody. Pursuant to Section 295C, the police arrested Shaikh on 4 October 2000. He was held in Adyala Gaol, Rawalpindi.\n\nIn August 2001, defended by a lawyer, Shaikh went to trial. The judgement was rendered at Adyala Jail, which was under vigil by armed Islamic zealots. On 18 August, the trial judge, Safdar Hussain, ordered the death penalty as well as a 100,000 rupee fine. The judge declared, \"He deserves to be hanged for making derogatory remarks against the Prophet.\" Shaikh is the third Muslim to be sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws.\n\nThe International Humanist and Ethical Union, Amnesty International, Mukto-Mona and Sea of Faith launched a campaign to win Shaikh's release. Demonstrations on his behalf occurred outside the Pakistani Embassies in London, Washington, and several other western capitals.\n\nShaikh appealed to the High Court. There the two presiding judges differed on whether the judgement should stand. On 15 July 2002, the case went to a senior judge. On 9 October 2003, the senior judge announced that the original judgement was unsound. He ordered a retrial.\n\nThe retrial was held over three sessions in November 2003. Shaikh did not use a lawyer to defend him because of threats to his lawyers by the extremist mullahs and the Pakistani Taliban. He defended himself after secretly studying law during his 3 years incarceration. On 21 November 2003, the trial judge acquitted Shaikh on legal grounds, and ordered that he be released. Commenting on the judgement, Shaikh explained: \"The judge accepted my legal arguments and found the charges against me to be baseless. My accusers, two mullahs and some Islamist students, had lied while under the oath on the Holy Koran.\" He described his ordeal as: \"Islamic terrorism through the abuse of law and of the state apparatus\" No case was registered against the mullahs and Islamic witnesses who made false accusations and gave false evidence. He was not compensated for millions of dollars he lost in the trial either.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, as part of a duopoly with ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV (channel 7).\n\nThe two stations share studios at Broadcast House on 10 Mile Road in Southfield; WMYD's transmitter is located on Eight Mile Road in Oak Park, along the Oakland–Wayne county line. Previously, WMYD maintained separate studios at the American Center Building on Franklin Road, also in Southfield, while the WXYZ-TV facilities only housed WMYD's master control and some internal operations.\n\nOn cable, WMYD is available in standard definition on channel 3 on Comcast Xfinity's Detroit city, western Wayne County and Macomb County systems, and on Charter Spectrum (though some systems carry it on channel 6), channel 20 in most other suburbs and on AT&T U-verse, and channel 62 on Cogeco's system in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and in high definition on Xfinity channel 235 and U-verse channel 1020.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 15, 1968 as WXON-TV, broadcasting on UHF channel 62 and operating as an independent station. It moved to channel 20 in 1972 after two short-lived stations abandoned the frequency in the 1950s and 1960s; the first was WPAG-TV in Ann Arbor, which started broadcasting in April 1953, and suspended operations in December 1957 in a failed attempt to move to VHF channel 12. In 1960, WJMY-TV in Allen Park was awarded a construction permit for channel 20, broadcasting for eight months in 1962-63. After the previous owner died, new owners tried several times to bring WJMY back on, airing a series of test signals in the late 1960s; they finally gave up in 1970, paving the way for WXON to purchase WJMY's construction permit and move to channel 20 in November 1972. WGPR-TV (now CBS owned-and-operated station WWJ-TV) took over the channel 62 frequency in 1975.\n\nWXON initially operated from studio facilities located on Decker Road in the Oakland County town of Walled Lake, but later moved to its present location in Southfield. Through the 1970s, WXON aired cartoons, lower-rated sitcoms, off-network dramas, old movies, religious programs and the annual Variety Club of Detroit telethon hosted by Soupy Sales. It offered English-dubbed versions of live action Japanese sci-fi children's programs such as \"Ultraman\", \"Johnny Sokko\" and \"Space Giants\". WXON also brought the infamous late-night horror movie cult favorite \"The Ghoul Show\" back to Detroit television after WKBD had canceled it in 1975. In addition, the station broadcast the anime series, \"Robotech\", initially as a 1985 summer replacement series with two consecutive episodes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, each weekday. Continuing much as channel 62 had earlier, WXON also often aired a package of films primarily sourced from American International Pictures and heavily balanced toward 1950s and early 1960s horror and science-fiction features.\n\nIn 1979, WXON began to carry subscription television programming provided by ONTV, which aired daily after 8 p.m. The ONTV broadcasts were encrypted, requiring a rented set-top box to decode WXON's signal during hours when the station ran ONTV programming; the service was not cheap at $22.50 a month (equivalent to $ in adjusted for inflation). Many people, especially those living across the river in Windsor, Ontario, who figured out the technological simplicities in how WXON encrypted ONTV programming built their own decoder boxes and watched the service for free illegally. The network carried uncut movies, concerts and local sporting events. However, since many games began before 8 in the evening, fans missed the start of many contests. In one famous incident, the Detroit Red Wings racked up a 5–0 lead in a game against the Calgary Flames before ONTV began its coverage.\n\nIn 1982, WXON began airing ONTV on weekend afternoons and faced a challenge from In-Home Theatre, which aired 24 hours a day on WIHT (channel 31, now WPXD-TV) in Ann Arbor. Still lagging far behind WKBD-TV (channel 50) in the ratings, WXON dropped ONTV on March 31, 1983 and resumed a general entertainment format full-time. It added a number of movies to its lineup. The station also acquired several barter cartoons as the children's programming business peaked between 1984 and 1985. As the 1980s progressed, the station began acquiring stronger off-network sitcoms. It got a significant boost after WKBD became a Fox charter affiliate on October 6, 1986. Channel 20 was an established independent station by 1991. When fellow Detroit outlet WJBK dropped its CBS affiliation in favor of Fox, the former network approached WXON for an affiliation deal which the station rejected; though ABC would also briefly court channel 20 out of fear of losing WXYZ-TV to CBS without success (as WXON was more interested in joining The WB when it launched); thus, channel 20 was unaffected by the network affiliation swaps that occurred in December 1994. Until that year, the station signed off the air early each morning from 1 to 5 a.m.; the station has generally broadcast a 24-hour schedule ever since although it has signed-off and signed back on periodically during the late 1990s.\n\nOn January 11, 1995, WXON became a charter affiliate of the upstart WB Television Network. Granite Broadcasting bought WXON two years later in January 1997 and on October 14 of that year, the station's call letters were changed to WDWB. In 2004, the station became the new over-the-air broadcast home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, taking the rights from the team's longtime broadcaster, WKBD and was the broadcast home for 15 to 20 Detroit Tigers baseball games produced by Fox Sports Net Detroit. WDWB carried the full WB network schedule, but after joining the network it frequently preempted programming that it rescheduled or did not air in favor of programming such as movies, Big Ten Conference basketball, the Pistons, the Tigers, and from 1999 until 2012, the \"Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon\". Like the baseball and basketball games, the annual MDA telethon was broadcast live, but since the station had no studios to accommodate the local telethon segments, it was produced out of the studios of PBS member station WTVS (channel 56) in the New Center section of downtown Detroit.\n\nIn September 2005, Granite announced its intention to sell WDWB and its San Francisco sister station KBWB (now KOFY-TV) to AM Media Holdings, Inc. (a unit of Acon Investments and several key Granite shareholders) for a price rated, on WDWB's end, to around $97 million. The low price (Granite had purchased the station for $175 million) was largely out of Granite wanting to cut down its debt load while keeping control of the stations. On February 15, 2006, Granite announced the restructuring of the sale considering the changing conditions of the station but the sale eventually fell apart. In May 2006, DS Audible announced its intent to purchase the stations for about $84 million on WDWB's end. On July 18, 2006, this sale also fell apart and Granite announced its intention to retain the station. In November, Granite Broadcasting announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy but would continue to operate its stations including WMYD.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. One month later on February 22, News Corporation announced the launch of a new \"sixth\" network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created to give UPN and WB stations that were not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates another option besides converting to independent stations.\n\nLike many stations about to lose a WB or UPN affiliation due to The CW's launch, WDWB changed its on-air logo to remove the \"WB\" logo; its new logo was introduced during a Pistons-Minnesota Timberwolves basketball game on February 1. The station had also announced that it would no longer promote any WB programing. The station changed its call letters to the current WMYD on May 7 in recognition of its future affiliation. On July 29, 2006, the new WMYD logo was introduced during a Tigers-Minnesota Twins baseball game in preparation for its switch; the station was then re-branded as \"My TV 20\". During the time before the actual launch, WMYD covered up all WB branding during programming and did not carry network promos. It became a MyNetworkTV affiliate on September 5 and WKBD joined The CW on September 18.\n\nOccasionally as time now permits, WMYD may carry network programming from Fox, NBC or ABC should either WJBK (channel 2), WDIV-TV (channel 4) or WXYZ-TV (channel 7) preempt any shows for special programs, or extended breaking news or severe weather coverage; as of now, it has not done so. In April 2008, WMYD began airing \"Wolfman Mac's Nightmare Sinema\" (now known as \"Wolfman Mac's Chiller Drive-In\"), a 90-minute comedic \"horror host\" series hosted by \"Wolfman\" Mac Kelly featuring vintage sci-fi and horror films, skits and cartoons. It is the first original locally produced show of its kind to be seen in Detroit in over a decade. The program was dropped from WMYD's schedule on February 14, 2010, three months after \"Chiller Drive-In\" reached a deal with the Retro Television Network to show reruns as well as new episodes.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, the E. W. Scripps Company announced that it would acquire WMYD and ABC affiliate WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York from Granite Broadcasting for $110 million. The purchase created a duopoly with Scripps' ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV. In addition, Scripps began to take over certain operations of WMYD through a time brokerage agreement until the purchase was consummated. Another likely factor in the purchase was for Scripps to acquire Indianapolis' WNDY from LIN Media, which would have formed a duopoly with sister station WRTV. The FCC approved the sale on May 2. The sale was completed on June 16.\n\nWith the purchase, the station and WKBW-TV became the most recent purchase by Scripps; the previous one was of the television division of McGraw-Hill Broadcasting in 2011 where it acquired nine stations. In early June, Granite employees stopped updating the station's Facebook and Twitter accounts, as well as news blogs as part of the station's news department. Also, WMYD's news department was shifted to WXYZ's following the sale; the final WMYD-produced newscast aired on June 13. The station's Granite Broadcasting-era website was redirected to WXYZ's page for the station after the sale was completed three days later. Also, WMYD's branding changed to \"TV 20 Detroit\", and debuted a brand new logo (seen above) on that day. WMYD was also the first and only MyNetworkTV station owned by Scripps until their merger with Journal Broadcasting.\n\nThe station digital signal is multiplexed:\nWMYD formerly carried Universal Sports on its second digital subchannel from October 15, 2007 until August 2008 (shortly after its rebranding from World Championship Sports Network to Universal Sports). A standard definition simulcast of the station's main channel was later carried on digital channel 20.2. The subchannel was eventually deleted altogether, although it was reactivated on September 12, 2011 as an affiliate of TheCoolTV. That network was dropped on September 19, 2012, as TheCoolTV experienced severe liquidity issues (and the inability to pay WMYD for their carriage), which resulted in a near-complete collapse of its affiliate base into 2013; in the meantime it became a standard definition simulcast of 20.1.\n\nOn March 8, 2013, Cozi TV began to broadcast on WMYD-DT, with Escape arriving on July 1, 2015. On February 1, 2016, Antenna TV launched on 20.2, with Cozi moving to Antenna's former home on WADL-DT4 (who had dropped Antenna TV five months earlier).\n\nWMYD shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on February 17, 2009, the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. As a result, WMYD was the only major television station in Detroit and one of two commercial stations in Detroit overall (alongside WPXD-TV, channel 31) to terminate its analog signal before June 12, the date which Congress chose to reschedule the completion of the digital transition. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 21. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 20.\n\nAs part of the SAFER Act, WMYD kept its analog signal on the air until March 4 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. Prior to the digital switchover, WMYD transmitted its signal from a 1,000-foot tower at the intersection of Eleven Mile and Inkster Roads in Southfield along with WTVS (channel 56) and WKBD-TV (channel 50). Only WKBD and WPXD-TV (channel 31) currently transmit their signals from that tower.\n\nSyndicated programming on WMYD includes \"Daily Mail TV\", \"Right This Minute\", \"Maury\", and \"The 700 Club\" among others. It also carries Fox's Saturday morning infomercial block, \"Weekend Marketplace\", which is preempted by the network's owned-and-operated station WJBK.\n\nDuring its days as a carrier of ON-TV, WXON carried games from Detroit's major professional sports teams. However, because ON-TV signed on at 8 p.m., WXON did not broadcast the early portions of many games. In 2006, WMYD began carrying more sporting events on its schedule involving local teams including Detroit Tigers baseball (produced by Fox Sports Detroit) and Detroit Pistons basketball; the Tigers telecasts moved to WJBK in 2007, and both the Pistons and Tigers moved exclusively to Fox Sports Detroit beginning in 2008.\n\nIn October 2014, WMYD acquired a package of Oakland University Golden Grizzlies college basketball games, airing eight men's games and two women's games during the 2014-15 season.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, the station aired live news updates in various forms. In the 1990s, it had a short-lived weekly show called \"NewsWrap\", which aired late Sunday nights. It also carried programming from the All News Channel during the overnight hours.\n\nOn July 14, 2008, WMYD launched a weeknight prime time newscast produced by the Independent News Network (INN) in order to compete with WJBK's longer-established hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast. Titled \"My TV20 News at 10\", the half-hour newscast was produced out of INN's facilities in Davenport, Iowa. Although news anchors, meteorologists and sports anchors were provided by the centralized news operation, WMYD maintained two locally-based reporters that contributed to the broadcast. In September 2009, Granite terminated the agreement with INN, and production of the newscast was shifted to WMYD's Fort Wayne, Indiana sister station and NBC affiliate WISE-TV (whose studio had recently become a master control hub for the company's Midwestern stations). As before, the newscast was produced in advance using centralized anchors, with contributions from Detroit-based reporters.\n\nWith the acquisition of the station by Scripps, new sister station WXYZ-TV began producing news programming for WMYD; on June 16, 2014, the station re-launched its primetime newscast as \"7 Action News at 10 on TV 20 Detroit\". On August 4, 2014, WMYD also introduced a two-hour extension of \"Action News This Morning\", running from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.; both the morning and 10 p.m. newscasts are designed to compete against WJBK, which has historically been the only other station in Detroit to air newscasts in these timeslots.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1806782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806782", "title": "New Soviet man", "text": "New Soviet man\n\nThe New Soviet man or New Soviet person ( \"novy sovetsky chelovek\"), as postulated by the ideologists of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was an archetype of a person with specific qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the Soviet Union, irrespective of the country's cultural, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, creating a single Soviet people and Soviet nation.\n\nFrom the ideology's roots in the mid 19th and early 20th century, ideologists of Communism have postulated that within the new society of pure communism and the social conditions therein, a New Man and New Woman would develop with qualities reflecting surrounding circumstances of post-scarcity and unprecedented scientific development.\nFor example, Leon Trotsky wrote in 1924 in \"Literature and Revolution\" about the \"Communist man\", \"man of the future\":\n\nWilhelm Reich asked in 1933: \n\nWill the new socio-economic system reproduce itself in the structure of the people's character? If so, how? Will his traits be inherited by his children? Will he be a free, self-regulating personality? Will the elements of freedom incorporated into the structure of the personality make any authoritarian forms of government unnecessary?\n\nThe Soviet man was to be selfless, learned, healthy, muscular, and enthusiastic in spreading the socialist Revolution. Adherence to Marxism-Leninism, and individual behavior consistent with that philosophy's prescriptions, were among the crucial traits expected of the New Soviet man, which required intellectualism and hard discipline. He was not driven by crude impulses of nature but by conscious self-mastery, a belief that required the rejection of both innate personality and the unconscious, which Soviet psychologists therefore rejected.\n\nHe treated public property with respect, as if it were his own. He also has lost any nationalist sentiments, being Soviet rather than Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any of the many other nationalities found in the USSR.\n\nHis work required exertion and austerity, to show the new man triumphing over his base instincts. Alexey Stakhanov's spurious record-breaking day in mining coal caused him to be set forth as the exemplar of the \"new man\" and the members of Stakhanovite movements tried to become Stakhanovites.\n\nThis could also be a new woman; \"Pravda\" described the Soviet woman as someone who had and could never have existed before. Female Stakhanovites were rarer than male, but a quarter of all trade-union women were designated as \"norm-breaking.\" For the Paris World Fair, Vera Mukhina depicted a momentual sculpture, \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\", dressed in work clothing, pressing forward with his hammer and her sickle crossed.\n\nAleksandr Zinovyev put forth the satirical argument that a new kind of person was indeed created by the Soviet system, but held that this new man - which they call \"Homo Sovieticus\" - was in many ways the opposite of the ideal of the New Soviet man.\n\nAmong the major traits of a new Soviet man was selfless collectivism. The selfless new man was willing to sacrifice his life for good causes.\n\nThis trait was glorified from the first Soviet days, as exemplified by lines from the poem \"Vladimir Ilyich Lenin\" by the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky:\n\n<poem>\nWho needs a \"1\"?\nThe voice of a \"1\"\nWho will hear it?\nA \"1\" is nonsense.\n</poem>\n\nFictional characters and presentations of contemporary celebrities embodying this model were prominent features of Soviet cultural life, especially at times when fostering the concept of the New Soviet man was given special priority by the government.\n\nPro-natalist policies encouraging women to have many children were justified by the selfishness inherent in limiting the next generation of \"new men.\"\n\nIn the 1920s and into the Stalinist era the concept of the \"New Soviet Woman\" served alongside that of the \"New Soviet Man.\" Her roles were vastly different than that of her male counterpart; she was burdened with a complex identity that changed with ideology shifts in the party doctrine toward more conservative notions of the role of the family and the mother in the Soviet system. The New Soviet Woman was a Superwoman who balanced competing responsibilities and took on the burden of multiple roles: Communist citizen, full-time worker, wife and mother.\n\nThe New Soviet Person was generally characterized as male. In Soviet propaganda centered on the New Soviet Person, it was standard for men to be depicted as the primary actors, either battling opponents of the Marxist revolution or rebuilding the world. Women, on the other hand, were often portrayed as \"backward,\" passive beneficiaries of the revolution rather than its securers. This was so partly because the proletarian movement was organized and fought by men of the working class. Thus, propaganda often equated male domination with proletariat domination. Although the party leadership claimed the sexes enjoyed equal status under the law, a significant accomplishment in itself, men remained the measure of worth.\n\nThis marginalization of women in the newly developing civil order made it difficult for women to find a place among the proletarian class for which the revolution was fought. Regulations during the New Economic Policy period on the extent to which women could work in dangerous conditions, how many hours they could work in a shift and the kinds of special care they received during maternity made many factory owners reluctant to hire women, despite the Commissariat of Labor's requirements that women to be given equal access to employment.\n\nThere were gains made in combating illiteracy and promoting education for women during the 1920s. Soviet policy encouraged working-class women to attend school and develop vocational skills. There existed opportunities for women to participate in politics, become party members and vie for elected and administrative positions. Access to the political sphere, however, was extremely limited.\n\nJoseph Stalin's policies on women were more conservative than that of his predecessor Lenin. Because he was concerned with a declining population rate, Stalin de-emphasized the Marxist feminist view of women in society, which, in his view, freed women from patriarchy and capitalism. In keeping with the party line, Stalin reasserted the importance of women in the workforce and female education, primarily literacy, although he began to emphasize the role of mother in a way that differed from more radical notions of the early 1920s.\n\nThe \"withering away\" of the family was no longer a goal of economic and political progress. The new party line was that the family, like the state, was to grow stronger with the full realization of socialism. Massive propaganda campaigns linked the joys of motherhood with the benefits of Soviet power. Soviet ideology began to argue that women's public roles were compatible with her roles as wife and mother. In fact, that the two reinforced one another and were both necessary for real womanhood.\n\nThe New Soviet Woman differed greatly from the conceptions of revolutionaries preceding the 1930s. Instead of being freed from domestic concerns, she was bound to them. Though she now filled the role of man's peer in the workplace, she was also obligated to devote herself to being his helpmate in the home. One of the primary roles of the New Soviet Woman was that of mother. This role became of great importance in the wake of population decline beginning in the 1920s. War and revolution had decimated the population. Legislation legalizing abortions and the increasing use of contraception—though still not that widespread—in the 1920s also contributed to the lower population numbers as women began to work more and give birth less.\n\nAs a means to combat that trend, propaganda placed a new emphasis on the female's role as the perpetuator of the Communist regime in their ability to produce the next class of healthy workers, a policy called pronatalism. Propaganda presented pronatalism, a means to encourage women to bear children, in different ways to urban working-class women and to rural peasant women. Propaganda designed for an urban audience linked healthy female sexuality with reproduction while medical information to peasant women positioned conception as the purpose of sexual intercourse.\n\nDuring the 1920s and into the Stalinist era, Soviet policy forced women to curtail their professional aspirations in order to fulfill their dual role as worker and housewife. Competing requirements of family life limited female occupational mobility. Women managed the role strain experienced during the Stalinist era either by either a restriction of professional aspirations or by limiting family size. Despite pitfalls, unprecedented opportunities were available to lower-class women during this time. Women now had a voice in debates and the Zhenotdel, the women's section of the Central Committee from 1919–1930, made strides during its operation to increase political, social and economic agency of Soviet women.\n\n"}

The packages can be grouped together into a software repository called a depot, and a server can be configured to host multiple depots for installation of software packages and even entire systems.\n\nSD was first available with release 10.0 of HP-UX in 1995. Since then it has undergone several enhancements and bug fixes, and now provides a reliable software installation tool. It uses a client-server arrangement to distribute software using a background daemon called \"swagentd\". This agent is started at boot time, and communicates using either the TCP or UDP protocols through RPC. The SD packages are normally stored and transmitted in compressed \nform, using either the gzip or compress programs.\n\nThe tools for performing SD operations are normally accessed from the command line. SD includes the following commands:\n\n\nThese commands include a broad range of command-line options that allow relatively fine control of the task being performed. In addition to command-line programs, several of these tools can also launch GUI versions in an X Window System display. The GUI version of \"swinstall\" performs some filtering of the software list to match software packages with the system where it is being run.\n\nThe commands log messages to an administrative area, which can be useful for diagnosing installation issues or just tracking what software is loaded or removed.\n\nSoftware packages are built by means of a specification file, a set of install scripts, and the actual software content. The install scripts are executed during software installation, verification, and removal, and can be used to prepare a system for the software and to perform activation or deactivation of the package. The specification file determines how the software package will be organized, list the locations of the various files to be loaded into the package, restrict the systems on which the package can be installed, and determine the security configuration of the package. It also provides various information about the package, such as a name, version, and description.\n\nSoftware packages are organized in a hierarchy of containers, with the highest level being a bundle or product and the lowest being the filesets and then files. The hierarchy is arranged as follows:\n\n\nActually only the Product and Fileset levels are needed for many packages. The Subproduct level is sometimes used to group together Filesets, while the Bundle provides a higher-level grouping for related products. There can be one or more filesets in a Product, and one or more products in a Bundle. The Fileset level is used specifically for loading the files. A product can be installed without all of its associated filesets, &c.\n\nThe filesets and products can be linked together by various requirement tags, which cause swinstall to select the appropriate dependencies automatically.\n\nEach fileset can have multiple control scripts specific to the files it will load. These scripts are executed in the following order during an installation:\n\n\nThere is a corresponding set of scripts that are executed in the reverse order during a swremove:\n\n\nOther scripts include \"verify\" for performing a sanity check with the swverify command, unpreinstall, and unpostinstall. All, some, or none of these scripts can be included in the package, depending on the requirements of the installation. They are useful for performing cleanup of previous packages, creating links, adding the software directory to various search environment variables, and so forth.\n\n"}
{"id": "1806819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806819", "title": "Milton, Cambridgeshire", "text": "Milton, Cambridgeshire\n\nMilton is a village in the historic County of Cambridgeshire, just north of Cambridge, England with a population of approximately 4,679 (2011 census), up from 4,275 in the 2001 census.\n\nMilton grew from a small population of 31 peasants in 1086, growing slowly up to 170 people making up 40 families in 1728. The Ordnance Survey map of 1897 shows the extent of the buildings to be clustered around the High Street and Fen Road, with Milton Hall occupying the greatest area. Compared with the Ordnance Survey map of 1901 showing just a modest expansion, but already possessing its two churches as well a school, smithy, brewery, and five public houses. The population expanded to around 740 then remained fairly static in the period of the 1910s to the 1950s, the parish then grew more rapidly to greater than 1,700 in 1971.\n\nMilton expanded considerably in the late 1980s when two large housing estates were built between the bypass and the village. This resulted in a doubling of the population between the 1981 and 1991 censuses.\n\nThe latest expansion started in 2012 with the development of the North Lodge Park consisting of 88 homes, two football pitches, pavilion and car park, with the first residents moving in April 2014.\n\nThe A10 bypass was built between 1976 and 1978 around the west edge of village, splitting Butt Lane into two parts. As part of the Great Eastern Railway the Cambridge-Ely line was opened in 1845 bypassing the village to the east but with no station. The nearest station is Cambridge North railway station since opening in May 2017, approximately 1.6 miles walk/bike from the centre of the village.\n\nThe village possesses four pubs, three of which are Grade II listed buildings. A brewery, Milton Brewery, established in June 1999, moved to nearby Waterbeach in July 2012, although the village had previously had a brewery on Fen Road as early as 1901. There are two churches: All Saints' Church, which serves the Church of England parish of Milton, and a New Apostolic Church.\n\nThe village has a primary school but no secondary school. Most pupils continue their education at Impington Village College, Cottenham Village College or St. Bede's School, Cambridge. There is also an Agricultural College, part of the College of West Anglia. The original village school was located in Fen Road, whereas the modern one is on Butt Lane, but the original building no longer exists.\n\nThe Cambridge Science Park lies within the civil parish boundaries. It is separated from the village by the A14 dual carriageway road, but still accessible by foot/bike via the Jane Coston cycle bridge.\n\nLand between Milton and Waterbeach has been purchased for building a rowing lake by Cambridge Sport Lakes. Plans for an international-standard 8-lane rowing lake have been under consideration in Cambridge for many years. The original planning permission for the rowing lake was granted in 1995 but subsequently lapsed. However, permission was granted again in 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2015 the UK Footgolf Association opened its East of England headquarters in Milton on the site of the former Milton Park Golf Course. They host many tournaments, including the \"UK FootGolf International Open\" from 2015.\n\nMilton has acquired a reputation for having an unpleasant smell – the \"Milton Pong\" – caused by its proximity to the Cambridge Sewage Works and two recycling centres. South Cambridgeshire District Council took legal action against Anglian Water in 2003. In 2014, residents were asked to use an online \"pong log\" to encourage the authorities to make improvements. A £21 million upgrade to the sewage works, due to be completed in 2015, is intended to reduce the smells.\n\nMilton Country Park is located at the south-eastern edge of the village. It is built on the site of a former gravel pits. For many years it was a haven for wildlife but was formally designated as a country park in 1993. Two flooded pits called Todd's Pit and Dickerson's Pit now form freshwater lakes, both being available for fishing, the former for carp, the latter for general silver fish and pike. A smaller pool named Hall's Pool between the pits has a dipping platform, while Deep Pool, the deepest pit in the park lies to the north of Dickerson's Pit.\n\nA network of over two miles of paths leads around the park; many of these paths are suitable for bicycles and wheelchairs as well as those on foot.\n\nThe park's financial future became uncertain when South Cambridgeshire District Council announced that, due to the 2005 Council Tax capping, they could not continue to fund the park and were looking for a new body to do so, and that if that was unsuccessful they would close the park. A campaign to save the park collected over 10,000 signatures. In July 2007, the council agreed in principle to hand the management of the park to Cambridge Sport Lakes Trust which it did on 31 March 2008.\n\n"}

In order to meet demand a Bell 206 JetRanger was acquired in 1976, and by 1980 15,237 passengers had been carried. A free shuttle service in Monaco was introduced in 1983, a year in which 39,673 passengers were carried. A Eurocopter Dauphin was added to the fleet in 1991, joining a fleet made up of six Eurocopter AS350s and a Bell 206 JetRanger. The number of passengers carried in 1991 increased to some 94,300. 2000 saw the airline carrying 103,000 passengers and passing the 1,500,000 passengers carried mark.\n\nIn September 2003, the airline ordered a number of six-seat Eurocopter EC130B4 to replace the Eurocopter Squirrels in the fleet.\n\nOn 8 June 2004, a Heli Air Monaco Ecureuil on a scheduled flight from Monaco to Nice crashed into the sea 2.16 kilometres off Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, killing the pilot and four passengers.\n\nDue to a drop in the numbers of passengers being carried, in February 2009 Heli Air Monaco laid off ten employees and announced that an additional thirty employees may be laid off if the situation does not improve. Jacques Crovetto, the CEO of the company, noted that the Monegasque government takes taxes from the company, but gives no support to the company in return. The airline accounts for 90-95% of traffic at the Monaco Heliport, and its services are not subsidised. Crovetto also showed disdain for a decision by the Monegasque authorities to bar the company's minivans from operating in the bus lanes in Monaco, but in September 2009, he expressed hope that the decision would be overturned. He also noted that due to re-registration of passengers in Nice being required, it is almost as quick to take a taxi between Monaco and Nice. According to Heli Air Monaco, the Monaco-Nice route has a natural ceiling of 130,000 passengers per year, but in January 2009 the company only carried 3,450 passengers.\n\n\n"}

The population of the village was 13,278 in the 2011 census.\nFormed around a crossroads, the village has grown as urban expansion between Manchester and Liverpool extends outwards. St Wilfrid's Church is a Grade I listed parish church.\n\nThe name Standish is derived from the Old English \"stan\", meaning stone, and \"edisc\", a park or enclosure. It has been variously recorded as Stanedis in 1206, Stanediss in 1219, Standissh, Stanedich and Stanedissh in 1292 and Standisch in 1330. The adjoining village of Langtree was recorded as Langetre in 1206 and Longetre in 1330.\nA Roman road passed through the township.\n\nStandish and Langtree were part of the Penwortham barony in the 12th century, and between 1150 and 1164, Richard Bussel, Lord of Penwortham gave them to his brother-in-law Richard Spileman. In 1212 Thurstan Banastre held them and later they were held by William de Ferrers Earl of Derby, and then by 'the lords of Leylandshire'. The tenants adopted the local surnames, Standish and Langtree.\n\nFrom the 13th century, the Standish family were Lords of the Manor of Standish and owned the Standish Hall estate. The male line ended in 1755 with the death of Ralph Standish, and the estate was passed down through female lines until it was broken up in 1920. Standish Hall was sold to an American buyer in 1921 and later demolished. With the oldest part, constructed in 1574, transported and rebuilt in the U.S.A.\n\nThe Standish family were the main coal owners in the area, with their estate being mined since the 14th century. Coal mining in the area increased during the Industrial Revolution. During 1865-1866, the Standish collieries were merged into the Wigan Coal and Iron Company. By 1896, Wigan Coal & Iron owned the Broomfield, Giant's Hall, Gidlow, John, Langtree, Robin Hill, Swire and Taylor Pits. The largest of these was the Langtree Pit with over 540 employees.\n\nIn 1900 the two 20 ft shafts of Wigan Coal's Victoria Colliery were sunk. This would continue to operate until its closure by the National Coal Board in 1958. It is now a housing estate.\n\nStandish is north-by-northwest of Wigan, 19 miles north-west of Manchester, and 18 miles north-east of Liverpool. The A49 trunk road passes through the center of the village, on its way from Wigan to Chorley. Standish is served by Junction 27 of the M6 motorway, which is to the east of the village. The West Coast Main Line is on the western edge of the village, around a mile from the centre. The River Douglas and Bradley Brook form the boundary on the eastern side of Standish. Mill Brook, which flows into the Douglas, forms the western boundary. Standish is situated on a ridge of high land which rises to 370 feet and runs north to south across the township, near the river the land is between 120 and 160 feet.\n\nIn the village, the area of Standish lies to the south (covering 1,696 acres), and the area of Langtree to the north (covering 1,568 acres) – historically some considered them to be separate townships. Standish-with-Langtree is a total of . Locally, the village of Shevington is to the west, with the area of Shevington Moor to the north-west (near Langtree), and Standish Lower Ground, a distinct and separate community, is to the south-west.\n\nStandish has soil and subsoil of clay and the underlying rocks are the coal measures of the Lancashire Coalfield.\n\nStandish has a population of 13,278 people, based on the 2011 census, this represents 4.2% of the population of Wigan Borough. There is a higher than average number of residents over the age of 65, representing 19.9% of the population. It is an affluent community with seven out of the nine areas appearing within the top 30% most affluent in England. 80% of residents own their homes or have a mortgage; only 10% of households live in social housing.\n\nLying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Standish emerged as a township in the Middle Ages but by the mid-19th century was united with neighbouring Langtree, as Standish-with-Langtree. The township was in the larger Standish ecclesiastical parish.\n\nFollowing the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Standish-with-Langtree formed part of the Wigan Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to administer the Poor Law which made use of premises on Frog Lane Wigan and Hindley. Standish-with-Langtree became a local board of health established in 1872; Standish-with-Langtree Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board became an urban district within the administrative county of Lancashire.\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972, the Standish-with-Langtree Urban District was abolished, and Standish has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. For electoral purposes, the village is within the Standish With Langtree Ward.\n\nThe residents' group \"Standish Voice\", was formed in July 2014 to address issues within the local area and be a forum for residents. In May 2015, it was designated as the Neighbourhood Forum for Standish, with the aim of creating a Neighbourhood Plan for the village. Following a Neighbourhood Referendum on 18 July 2019, Standish Neighbourhood Plan 2015–2030 was adopted into the development plan for Wigan borough (with 94.5% voting in favour). The legally-binding document covers the use and development of land; and guides future development, regeneration and conservation of the area.\n\nThere are 22 Listed buildings in Standish with one at Grade I and two at Grade II.\n\nSt Wilfrid's Parish Church is the only building with a Grade I listing in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan. In the Market Place in front of the church is a late medieval cross, stone stocks and a 14th-century well.\n\nStandish has the 22-acre Ashfield park which contains a mixture of woodland, open green-space and recreational facilities. Part of Ashfield is designated locally as a historic park and garden.\n\nThe village has two Grade II listed war memorials; a memorial cross at the St Marie's Catholic Church, and Standish Pillar War Memorial in the Victoria Jubilee Memorial Garden (near \"the Globe\" pub). The Pillar War Memorial, unveiled in 1920, was dedicated to the men of Standish lost in the First World War; with further inscriptions added after WWII.\n\nIn the south of the village is Gidlow Cemetery, which was founded in 1948.\n\nStandish is on the Wigan to Chorley bus route with the Arriva North West 362 and Stagecoach Manchester 113 buses stopping every 20 minutes. It is also served by the 640 and 641 Standish Circular route operated by Diamond North West.\n\nThe village was formerly served by two railway stations: Standish railway station to the north and the Boar's Head railway station to the south. Both were on the West Coast Main Line and closed in 1949. Standish was also formerly served by trams, run by Wigan Corporation Tramways, which ceased operation in 1931.\n\nStandish has a number of footpaths and cycling routes. Standish Mineral Line, locally known as 'The Line', was upgraded to in 2018 as part of the Standish Cycleway project. The former railway line runs from the village centre to the former Robin Hill Colliery near Shevington Moor.\n\nStandish has one secondary school, Standish Community High School, which has approximately 1,250 students aged 11–16. Standish also has three primary schools: St. Wilfrid's Church of England Primary Academy, St Marie's Catholic Primary School, and Woodfold Primary School.\n\nStandish has a library in the village centre.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1806859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806859", "title": "Centennial Park (Nashville)", "text": "Centennial Park (Nashville)\n\nCentennial Park is a large urban park located approximately two miles (three km) west of downtown Nashville, Tennessee, across West End Avenue (U.S. Highway 70S) from the campus of Vanderbilt University. The 21st-century headquarters campus of the Hospital Corporation of America was developed adjacent to the park.\n\nCultivated as farmland by some of the earliest families in Nashville, the territory became controlled by the state and used as a park after the American Civil War. In the last decade, it was used as a racetrack. It was redeveloped as the site of the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in 1897. Afterward most of the temporary exhibit structures were removed, but the replica of the Parthenon remained. Centennial Park was opened in 1903. Due to the popularity of the Parthenon, it was rebuilt in the 1920s in steel and concrete. Under Jim Crow laws, African Americans were excluded from this public park and its swimming pool until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964.\n\nThe park was originally farmland that had belonged to John Cockrill and his wife, Anne Robertson Johnson Cockrill (1757–1821), the sister of General James Robertson. She and her family came from Wake County, North Carolina to Fort Nashborough (now Nashville) in the Donelson Flotilla, led by John Donelson. (His daughter Rachel married Andrew Jackson.) Anne Cockrill was the first woman to be given a land grant in Tennessee. Their son Mark R. Cockrill became known as the \"Wool King of the World\", as he had a large sheep herd in Nashville. He owned up to 300 slaves prior to the Civil War, with most of them assigned to his Mississippi cotton plantation. Cockrill loaned gold and wool to the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. After the Union Army occupied Tennessee, he was arrested and jailed for his Confederate support.\n\nSome of the land was part of the Burlington plantation established by Joseph T. Elliston, who served as the fourth mayor of Nashville from 1814 to 1817. It was later owned by his son, William R. Elliston, a Whig politician. The Ellistons were slaveholders, and their plantation extended into what are now part of the campus of Vanderbilt University and West End Park. Their mansion, on modern-day Elliston Place, was torn down in the 1930s.\n\nAfter the Civil War, this land was adapted for the state fairgrounds. From 1884 to 1895, more of the site was devoted to a racetrack and was known as West Side Park. In 1897, it was developed as the site of the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition and was renamed as Centennial Park. In preparation for the exposition, the area was landscaped and new, temporary buildings were constructed for exhibit space. An artificial lake, Lake Watauga, was developed in the park, as were sunken gardens and a bandshell for music performances. The lake was named for an area in western North Carolina that was the origin of a number of early settlers of Nashville.\n\nA replica of the Parthenon was also built, to honor Nashville's status as \"The Athens of the South\", and was intended to be longterm. It was designed by William Crawford Smith.\n\nAs was common with such expositions, afterward most of the temporary buildings and exhibits were dismantled. Lake Watauga, the gardens, bandshell and the Parthenon were the most prominent features when the park was officially dedicated in May 1903. Consistent with Jim Crow laws, African Americans were prohibited from using Centennial Park, as they had been excluded from its previous manifestations as parks.\n\nIn 1909, the Confederate Private Monument, designed by George Julian Zolnay, was dedicated. The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) had helped raise money to commission the monument.\n\nCentennial Park became an important recreation site for whites of Nashville. As African-American activism increased for renewed civil rights, the park became a site of conflicts. On July 18, 1961, six African Americans were turned away when they tried to use the public swimming pool in the park, which, was, of course, supported by their tax dollars. The next day, all Nashville public pools were closed under the pretext of \"financial reasons\". It was not until after passage in 1964 of a national civil rights law ending discrimination that African Americans were allowed to use the park. The pool was redeveloped as an arts center.\n\nThe Parthenon replica had been built as a temporary building to house the Nashville pavilion. As it deteriorated, it was proposed for demolition but residents favored keeping it. Finally, in the 1920s the city and park officials agreed to replace the temporary plaster building with a permanent, concrete and steel structure. It is still standing and has been renovated as needed.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1967, the Parthenon was the backdrop for an enormous nativity scene sponsored by Harveys department store. (This has since gone out of business.) The scene was approximately long, deep and was flooded with colorful lights. However, by 1968, it was sold to a Cincinnati shopping center. According to the \"Nashville Banner\", the nativity scene was shown only two Christmas seasons in Cincinnati before it collapsed and was discarded.\n\nIn the 1960s, the park was the site of Sunday afternoon concerts; Pat Boone was among the early performers in this series. In 1975, Robert Altman shot the climactic scene of his film \"Nashville\" in the park.\n\nIn 1990, a statue of Pallas Athena, designed by Nashville sculptor Alan LeQuire, was added to the art gallery inside the Parthenon. It is dedicated to the women's suffrage movement.\n\nBy the late 20th century, the park had many mature shade trees. The 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak damaged or destroyed most of them, a loss that would take generations to replace. A Vanderbilt ROTC cadet died in the park during the storm; he was the only fatality.\n\nOn November 11, 2005, Centennial Park became Nashville's first wireless internet park by offering free Wi-Fi internet access to park patrons. The park's bandshell was the site of the annual \"Shakespeare in the Park\" presented by the Nashville Shakespeare Festival for thirty years until its move to Nashville's oneC1TY in 2019.\n\nIn 2012, workers found the source of the spring that was a major feature during Anne Robertson Johnson Cockrill's ownership of the land. For 100 years, it had been capped and piped to the sewer, with a flow of more than 100 gallons of water per minute. What is now called Cockrill Springs is a new natural feature of the park.\n\nOn August 26, 2016, as part of Women's Equality Day, a monument by Alan LeQuire was unveiled in the park. It features depictions of Carrie Chapman Catt, Anne Dallas Dudley, Abby Crawford Milton, Juno Frankie Pierce, and Sue Shelton White, local activists for women suffrage.\n\nThe park also contains a recreation center. It is also the site of the administrative offices of the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, but these area being relocated to the East Bank of the Cumberland River and the offices of the former Nashville Bridge Company.\n\n\n"}

He has served as a Member of the Bundestag (MP) and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Germany.\n\nA member of the noble Lambsdorff family, he holds an Imperial Russian comital title.\n\nLambsdorff grew up in Hamburg, Brussels, and Bonn, attending the Catholic Academic High School Aloisiuskolleg at Bonn-Bad Godesberg until 1985, before going up to the University of Bonn.\n\nFrom 1991 until 1993 Lambsdorff studied at Georgetown University on a Fulbright Scholarship graduating as a MA in History and an MS in Foreign Service (1993).\n\nAfter diplomatic training, Lambsdorff served on the German Policy Planning Staff (together with Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, his contemporary and fellow FDP MEP) before becoming director of the Bundestag office of former German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, after the FDP left government in 1998.\n\n\nLambsdorff was first elected to the European Parliament in 2004 and was confirmed in 2009 and 2014. Held in high regard, he was widely viewed as a possible successor to Graham Watson as leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group in the parliament, but the post went instead to Guy Verhofstadt. From 2011, Lambsdorff chaired the 12-member German FDP delegation in the European Parliament, before subsequently being elected Leader of the European Liberals and Democrats Group in 2014.\n\nUntil 2014, Lambsdorff served as member of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and the EU-Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China. He also served as a deputy on the European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education and on the Delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee DACP as well as the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. During his tenure, he steered efforts to create a single EU-market for Defence and Security-related equipment as parliamentary rapporteur in 2009. In 2010, he joined the \"Friends of the EEAS\", a unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on the formation of the European External Action Service.\n\nFollowing the 2014 elections to the European Parliament, Lambsdorff became a member of the European Parliament Committee on International Trade. In this capacity, he has served as the parliament's rapporteur on the EU's agreement on the participation of Croatia in the European Economic Area.\n\nLambsdorff has led EU-Election Observer Missions on numerous occasions: as head of the EU-Election Observation Mission during the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis, he described the presidential elections as \"flawed\". Other elections he has overseen include the Bangladeshi general election in 2008, the first free Guinean presidential elections in 2010 and the Myanma general election in 2015.\n\nIn January 2014, at the FDP Convention in Bonn, Lambsdorff was elected as his party's lead candidate for the European Parliament elections receiving a resounding 86.2% of the vote.\n\nFrom 2014, Lambsdorff served as one of the fourteen Vice Presidents of the European Parliament who sit in for the president in presiding over the plenary. In this capacity, he was also in charge of representing the parliament at multilateral bodies, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, as well as of the parliament’s contacts with European business associations. In addition, he was a member of the Democracy Support and Election Coordination Group (DEG), which oversees the Parliament’s election observation missions.\n\nLambsdorff has been a member of the German Bundestag since the 2017 national elections. He has since been serving as one of six deputy chairpersons of the FDP parliamentary group under the leadership of its chairman Christian Lindner, where he oversees the group's activities on foreign policy. In addition, he chairs the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group.\n\n\nFollowing the 2017 state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lambsdorff was part of the FDP team in the negotiations with Armin Laschet’s CDU on a coalition agreement. He led his party's delegation in the working group on European affairs; his co-chair of the CDU was Matthias Kerkhoff.\n\nLambsdorff has become increasingly critical of an accession of Turkey to the European Union and publicly declared that accession talks should be suspended until the Turkish government returns to the direction of the EU. In 2011, he accused Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of using \"gunboat rhetoric\" in his statements about Israel, adding that \"with a strident anti-Israel course, it isn't making any friends in Europe.\" On the 2014 post-election protests in Turkey, he commented: \"There are more journalists in jail [in Turkey] than in China or Iran and now the Prime Minister wants to close down YouTube and Twitter because people are saying things he doesn’t like.\" When Erdoğan, then in his position as President of Turkey, disparaged German president Joachim Gauck as a \"pastor\" in 2014, Lambsdorff demanded that \"the negotiations [on EU accession] should be put in a deep freeze.\"\n\nFollowing British Prime Minister David Cameron's veto of EU-wide treaty change to tackle the European debt crisis in 2011, Lambsdorff was quoted by German weekly \"Der Spiegel\" as saying: \"It was a mistake to admit the British into the European Union.\"\n\nWhen Chancellor Angela Merkel's government opted in 2011 to abstain from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 authorizing military force against Libya, Lambsdorff publicly criticized his fellow FDP member and then Germany’s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, arguing that \"Germany's vote has weakened the EU.\"\n\nAlong with his fellow parliamentarians Marietje Schaake, Ramon Tremosa and members of the Greens/EFA group, Lambsdorff nominated Leyla Yunus, imprisoned Azerbaijani human rights activist and director of the Institute of Peace and Democracy, for the 2014 Sakharov Prize.\n\nAs a consequence of the European debt crisis, Lambsdorff told the \"Financial Times Deutschland\" in 2012 that it might make sense to give the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs greater influence over euro-zone countries’ budgets.\nFollowing the 2014 European elections, Lambsdorff openly rejected Pierre Moscovici’s nomination as European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, stating that Moscovici should be held accountable for France's rising deficit and worsening economic situation.\n\nIn December 2014, Lambsdorff proposed that the English language should be mastered by servants of the public administration, and should later become an official language of Germany, in addition to German. According to Lambsdorff, as experienced in other countries with a good knowledge of English in public institutions, this should help to attract more skilled migrants to prevent labor shortage, to ease business for investors and to establish a more welcoming culture. As evaluated by a representative YouGov survey, 59 percent of all Germans would welcome the establishment of English as an official language in the whole European Union.\n\n\nCount Alexander Lambsdorff is a member of the Baltic branch of the noble Lambsdorff family; his family branch emigrated from Westphalia to the Baltic region in the early 15th century and was recognised as noble in Courland in 1620. The family owned large estates in modern-day Latvia and Estonia, and family members distinguished themselves as military officers in the service of the Russian Empire. One of Alexander Lambsdorff's ancestors, Count Matthias von der Wenge Lambsdorff, was a Russian general and was conferred the hereditary comital title in 1817 by Alexander I of Russia. In 1880 the family was authorised by royal licence to use the titles \"Baron of the Wenge\" and \"Count of Lambsdorff\" in the Kingdom of Prussia. His father, Count Hagen Lambsdorff (born 1935), was the first German Ambassador to Latvia from 1991 and later Ambassador to the Czech Republic from 1999 to 2001; his uncle, Count Otto Lambsdorff (1926–2009), was a prominent liberal politician and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs from 1977 to 1982.\n\nIn 1994, Lambsdorff married Franziska, daughter of Werner von Klitzing and Princess Wilhelmina of Wied, by whom he has two children.\n\nIt is equivalent to the noble rank of \"Earl\" (female form: \"Countess\").\n\n"}

Sponsored by First Lieutenant Margaret Shields Farr, WAC, the great-granddaughter of Purser Shields, the destroyer was launched on 25 September 1944 and commissioned on 8 February 1945, Commander George B. Madden, USN, in command.\n\n\"Shields\"' shakedown cruise, interrupted by a nine-day escort assignment with , lasted from 7 March to 18 April 1945. She departed Puget Sound on 6 May and, after several days of operations in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, shoved off for Eniwetok Atoll with convoy #PD-413-T. Her short period of combat service in World War II, 24 May – 15 August 1945, consisted almost entirely of escort duty between and patrol duty around Eniwetok, Ulithi, Leyte, Okinawa, and Borneo. \"Shields\" saw actual combat only once during the war; she shelled Japanese shore installations at Miri, Borneo, in support of Australian ground forces, on 26 June 1945.\n\n\"Shields\" was at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 15 August 1945 when she received orders from CINCPACAREA to \"cease all offensive activity against the Japanese.\" After a short cruise to Leyte, Subic Bay, and back to Okinawa, she got underway to rendezvous with Task Group 78.1 (TG 78.1) and serve as escort to units of Transport Squadron 17 (Transron 17), at that time ferrying occupation troops to Jinsen, Korea. The occupation commenced without opposition; and, on 12 September, she steamed out of Jinsen with Task Unit 71.5.1 (TU 71.5.1) bound for the waters off northern China.\n\nFor most of the remainder of 1945, \"Shields\" remained in the area of the Gulf of Po Hai. Her primary assignment here was to participate in the naval demonstrations being conducted off the coast of northern China. Throughout this period, she also reconnoitered the unstable situation at the port of Chefoo. Her travels while operating off northern China took her to most of the major ports on the Gulf of Po Hai, including Chefoo, Chinwangto, Weihaiwei, Taku, Dairen, and Port Arthur.\n\n\"Shields\" rounded out her first Far Eastern tour with a mission to escort and to the end of the Seventh Fleet's area of responsibility and patrol duty with the Yangtze River Patrol Force based at Shanghai. She returned to San Pedro Bay, California, on 19 February 1946, having stopped along the way at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. She remained on the west coast until being decommissioned and placed in reserve on 14 June 1946.\n\nThough decommissioned, \"Shields\" continued in an in-service status, participating in the reserve program. She was recomissioned into active service at the outbreak of the Korean War and recommissioned on 15 July 1950. \"Shields\" arrived in the Far East in September 1951 for the first of three Korean War tours. During this cruise, which lasted until February 1952, she patrolled the Korean coast in the area of the bombline and Kojo, providing fire support for the First ROK Corps and the First Marine Division. She participated in the assault on Kojo and provided harassing and interdiction fire. Her second Korean War tour, commencing on 1 November 1952, found her again cruising off the Korean coast near the bombline supporting the First ROK Corps and the Eighth Army. Later she took part in antisubmarine warfare exercises off the coasts of Japan and Okinawa and concluded the deployment training Chinese Nationalist naval forces at Taiwan. Stopping at Hong Kong and Japan, \"Shields\" returned to San Diego on 1 June 1953.\n\nAfter six months on the west coast, she departed for her third Far Eastern cruise. Arriving off Korea on 11 February 1954, she operated there with TF 77 until being detached, on 21 February, to proceed to the Philippine Islands. \"Shields\" conducted operations out of Subic Bay during the months of March and April, patrolling the coast of Indochina with Carrier TG 70.2. On 7 May, she embarked for Yokosuka, Japan, stopping en route for a diplomatic representation at Hong Kong. After a week of tender upkeep at Yokosuka, \"Shields\" put to sea with TF 77 to conduct battle exercises. She returned to San Diego on 18 July 1954.\n\nBetween 18 July 1954 and 30 November 1963, \"Shields\" was deployed to WESTPAC seven times. When not assigned to the western Pacific, she engaged in normal destroyer activities out of her home port, San Diego. One of the highlights of this decade of \"Shields\"' career was her participation in the commemoration of the triumphant return of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Great White Fleet\" to San Francisco. Another important occasion was the award of the Battle Efficiency \"E\" for overall combat readiness in August 1960.\n\nOn 30 November 1963, \"Shields\" ceased operations as an active fleet unit and was assigned as a Naval Reserve Training ship, part of Reserve Destroyer Squadron 27. With her full-time crew cut more than 50%, she spent the next 8 years working with the Development and Training Command to maintain the combat efficiency of reservists. After a survey of \"Shields\" in March 1972, it was determined that the cost of her modernization would be prohibitive and that she was only of marginal value to the Navy without it. Consequently, \"Shields\" was decommissioned on 1 July 1972 and sold to the Brazilian Navy.\n\n\"Shields\" was awarded the Korean Presidential Unit Citation (Korea) and three battle stars for service in the Korean War.\n\n"}

He worked at the advertising agency Dentsu, where, in 1968, he met his future wife, the essayist .\n\nAraki is one of the most prolific Japanese artists. Many of his photographs are erotic, straddling a line between art and pornography. Among his photography books are \"Sentimental Journey\" (1971), and \"Tokyo Lucky Hole\" (1990). \"Sentimental Journey\" \"1972–1992\" is a diary of life with his wife Yōko, who died of ovarian cancer in 1990. The first part of \"Sentimental Journey\" shows the couple embarking on married life—their honeymoon and sexual relations. Pictures taken during Yoko's last days were published in \"Winter Journey\".\n\nParr and Badger include four of Araki's books in the first volume of their photobook history: \"Zerokkusu Shashincho 24\" (Xeroxed Photo Album), \"Senchimentaru na Tabi\" (Sentimental Journey), \"Tokyo Lucky Hole,\" and \"Shokuji\" (The Banquet).\n\nAraki contributed photography to the Sunrise anime series \"Brain Powerd\".\n\nIn 1981, Araki directed , a \"roman porno\" film, for the studio Nikkatsu. The film was a disappointment to Araki's fans and to fans of the \"pink film\" genre.\n\nThe Icelandic musician Björk is an admirer of Araki's work, and served as one of his models. At her request, he photographed the cover and inner sleeve pages of her 1997 remix album\"Telegram\". More recently, he has photographed pop singer Lady Gaga.\n\nIn 2005, an American director, Travis Klose, recorded a documentary about Araki called \"Arakimentari\", which discusses the artist's lifestyle and work.\n\nAraki was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008; he underwent successful surgery to remove the tumor.\n\nIn 2010, Araki's cat, Chiro, died of old age.\n\nIn October 2013, Araki lost vision in his right eye due to a retinal artery obstruction. The 74-year-old artist used the experience as an inspiration to exhibit \"Love on the left eye\", held on 21 June 2014 at Taka Ishii Gallery, Tokyo.\n\nCommissioned by Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta, Araki photographed Saskia de Brauw and Sung Jin Park in Tokyo for the brand's spring/summer 2015 campaign.\n\nAraki is known for his intimate access to models. When asked about this in 2011, he bragged that he gained access through sex.\n\nIn April 2018, Kaori, a model who posed for Araki from 2001 to 2016, wrote a blog post about her relationship with Araki in which she accused him of financial and artistic exploitation. Kaori stated that \"she worked without a contract, was forced to take part in explicit shoots in front of strangers, was not regularly paid and that her nude images were often used without her consent.\" In 2017, when she requested that he stop republishing or exhibiting some photographs of her, Araki wrote to Kaori, warning that she had no rights. She states that the experience led to psychological trauma and ill health. Kaori stated that the Me Too movement had encouraged her to speak out. The accusations have raised questions about the power dynamics between a photographer and his subject. In order to raise awareness of Kaori's claims, the activist group Angry Asian Girls Association protested the opening of an exhibition of photographs by Araki at C/O Berlin December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAraki's work is held in the following permanent public collections:\n\n"}

It is also abbreviated TEA, yet this abbreviation must be used carefully to avoid confusion with triethanolamine or tetraethylammonium, for which TEA is also a common abbreviation. It is a colourless volatile liquid with a strong fishy odor reminiscent of ammonia and is also the smell of the hawthorn plant. Like diisopropylethylamine (Hünig's base), triethylamine is commonly employed, usually as a base, in organic synthesis.\n\nTriethylamine is prepared by the alkylation of ammonia with ethanol:\n\nThe pK of protonated triethylamine is 10.75, and it can be used to prepare buffer solutions at that pH. The hydrochloride salt, triethylamine hydrochloride (triethylammonium chloride), is a colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic powder, which decomposes when heated to 261 °C.\n\nLaboratory samples of triethylamine can be purified by distilling from calcium hydride.\n\nTriethylamine is commonly employed in organic synthesis as a base. For example, it is commonly used as a base during the preparation of esters and amides from acyl chlorides. Such reactions lead to the production of hydrogen chloride which combines with triethylamine to form the salt triethylamine hydrochloride, commonly called triethylammonium chloride. This reaction removes the hydrogen chloride from the reaction mixture, which can be required for these reactions to proceed to completion (R, R' = alkyl, aryl):\n\nLike other tertiary amines, it catalyzes the formation of urethane foams and epoxy resins. It is also useful in dehydrohalogenation reactions and Swern oxidations.\n\nTriethylamine is readily alkylated to give the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt:\n\nTriethylamine is mainly used in the production of quaternary ammonium compounds for textile auxiliaries and quaternary ammonium salts of dyes. It is also a catalyst and acid neutralizer for condensation reactions and is useful as an intermediate for manufacturing medicines, pesticides and other chemicals.\n\nTriethylamine salts like any other tertiary ammonium salts are used as an ion-interaction reagent in ion interaction chromatography, due to their amphiphilic properties. Unlike quaternary ammonium salts, tertiary ammonium salts are much more volatile, therefore mass spectrometry can be used while performing analysis.\n\nTriethylamine is used to give salts of various carboxylic acid-containing pesticides, e.g. Triclopyr and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid\n\nTriethylamine is the active ingredient in FlyNap, a product for anesthetizing \"Drosophila melanogaster\". Triethylamine is used in mosquito and vector control labs to anesthetize mosquitoes. This is done to preserve any viral material that might be present during species identification.\n\nAlso, the bicarbonate salt of triethylamine (often abbreviated TEAB, triethylammonium bicarbonate) is useful in reverse phase chromatography, often in a gradient to purify nucleotides and other biomolecules.\n\nTriethylamine was found during the early 1940s to be hypergolic in combination with nitric acid, and was considered a possible propellant for early hypergolic rocket engines.\n\n"}

Burrington Combe is a gorge through the limestone hills although there is now no river running through it. Various cave entrances are exposed which have been occupied by humans for over 10,000 years, with a hillfort being built beside the combe in the Iron Age. The geology has led to a diversity of plant life.\n\nAccording to legend Augustus Montague Toplady was inspired to write the hymn \"Rock of Ages\" while sheltering under a rock in the combe, although recent scholars have disputed this claim.\n\nWater draining from Black Down has exposed rocks from the Devonian sandstones of the Portishead Formation which show through the limestone, Carboniferous mudstones of the Avon Group, limestones of the Black Rock Limestone Subgroup and oolitic limestones of the Burrington Oolite Subgroup; however the exact mechanism by which the gorge was formed is unknown. The northern and lower end of the combe, which was once the bed of the Congresbury Yeo, cuts through overlying Clifton Down Limestone. Triassic dolomitic conglomerate can also locally be seen along the combe.\n\nArchaeological discoveries of early cemeteries demonstrate human occupation of the combe and its caves from the Bronze Age with some evidence of occupation during the Upper Palaeolithic period. The combe contains the entrances to many of the caves of the Mendip Hills, including Aveline's Hole, Sidcot Swallet and Goatchurch Cavern. A through trip has been dug from Rod's Pot to Bath Swallet, which are both on the hills above the majority of Burrington caves. Further afield and equally accessible is Read's Cavern.\n\nGoatchurch Cavern is long and has a surveyed depth of . It was first recorded in 1736, and explored by lead miners in the 19th century.\nAround 1901, the owner unsuccessfully tried to turn it into a show cave. Notes of exploration in the 1920s record finds from the Pleistocene period including bones of mammoth, bear, hyaena and cave lion. During November 2003 inscribed marks were noticed in Goatchurch Cavern while cleaning away graffiti. Three finely cut marks were uncovered, resembling the letter W with a patina darker than in nearby graffiti dated 1704. These have been identified as ritual protection marks, possibly dating from the period 1550 to 1750. The term ritual protection mark was preferred to the description \"witch marks\".\n\nA swallet, also known as a sinkhole, sink, shakehole, swallow hole or doline, is a natural depression or hole in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock, often both, by water flowing beneath the water-table at considerable depth. Sidcot Swallet is named after the Sidcot School Speleological Society who explored it in 1925.\n\nThe earliest scientifically dated cemetery in Great Britain was found at Aveline's Hole. The human bone fragments it contained, from about 21 different individuals, are thought to be between roughly 10,200 and 10,400 years old. A series of inscribed crosses found on the wall of the Aveline's Hole cave are believed to date from the early Mesolithic period just after the Ice age.\n\nAbove the combe on its eastern side is the site of an Iron Age univallate hill fort known as Burrington Camp. It is around by and includes Romano-British elements.\n\nIn recognition of its biological and geological interest, an area of within and around the combe was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952.\n\nThe calcareous grasslands support a diverse flora which includes Salad burnet (\"Sanguisorba minor\"), Knapweed (\"Centaurea scabiosa\" and \"Centaurea nigra\"), Rock-rose (\"Helianthemum nummularium\") and Wild thyme (\"Thymus praecox\"). On the higher, more acidic, slopes Goldenrod (\"Solidago virgaurea\"), Wood sage (\"Teucrium scorodonia\") and Common Bent (\"Agrostis capillaris\") can be found. There are also scrub plants including Hawthorn (\"Crataegus monogyna\"), Mountain ash (\"Sorbus aucuparia\"), gorse (\"Ulex europaeus\") and Elder (\"Sambucus nigra\"). Several of the caves support bat populations.\n\nGeologically it is recognised as a fluvial karst feature which partly intersects a buried and filled gorge of Triassic age.\n\nThere is a legend that Augustus Montague Toplady (1740–78), who was the curate at Blagdon, was inspired to write the hymn \"Rock of Ages\" while sheltering under a rock in the combe during a thunderstorm in the late 18th century. The rock was subsequently named after the hymn. It is now generally accepted that the attribution of this location to the writing of \"Rock of Ages\" only arose well after Toplady's death (the 1850s is suggested by Percy Dearmer in \"Songs of Praise Discussed\", 1933) and has no proven factual basis.\n\nThe then Vicar at Westbury-on-Trym H. J. Wilkins published a 16-page booklet in 1938 titled \"\"An Enquiry concerning Toplady and his Hymn \"Rock of Ages\" and its connection with Burrington Combe, Somerset\"\" that found that in relation to the hymn \"All available evidence goes to show that it was published in 1776, soon after it was written.\" Toplady had left the neighbourhood of Burrington Combe in 1764.\n\nIn George Lawton's 1983 publication \"Within the Rock of Ages\" the author finds the claim that \"Rock of Ages\" was written at Burrington Combe to be only a legend, although he does state that \"It is extremely doubtful whether at this distance of time, the legend that it was written in a cleft there can be proved or disproved.\" In George Ella's 2000 study \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\" any links between the hymn and Burrington Combe are again said to be no more than legendary, with readers being referred to Lawton's 1983 study.\n\nC. H. Sisson wrote a poem entitled \"Burrington Combe\", collected in \"Exactions\" (Manchester: Carcanet 1980). The local area, including Black Down and Ellick Farm, features prominently in his poetry.\n"}

The machines are popular in places that have mandatory recycling laws or container deposit legislation. In some places, bottlers paid funds into a centralized pool to be disbursed to people who recycled the containers. Any excess funds were to be used for general environmental cleanup. In other places, such as Norway, the state mandated that a vendor pay for recycled bottles, but left the system in the hands of private industry.\n\nThe recycler places the empty bottle or can into the receiving aperture; the horizontal in-feed system allows the user to insert containers one at a time. (An alternative system, found in many older machines, is one in which the user opens a door by hand and places the empty container in a pan. When the door is released and closed, the process continues.) The bottle or can is then automatically rotated; the bottle/can is then scanned by an omnidirectional UPC scanner, which scans the beverage container's UPC. Some systems use the container form, embossing, material or other identification parameters to match the container against the database in addition to or instead of the barcode.\nOnce a container is scanned, identified (matched to database) and determined to be a participating container, it is processed and typically crushed (for one-time-use containers) to reduce its size, to avoid spillages of liquid and to increase storage capacity. Refillable containers are collected and sorted by hand to be brought back to the bottling company.\n\nThe first patent for a \"Bottle Return and Handling Machine\" was filed in the United States in 1920. The first working bottle return machine was invented and manufactured by Wicanders from Sweden used in the late 1950s. In 1962 an advanced automatic bottle return machine was designed by Aage Tveitan and manufactured in Norway by his company Arthur Tveitan AS. The first 3 in 1 machine was invented in 1994 by Kansmacker and is still in operation today in Detroit, Michigan.\n"}

{"id": "1806995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1806995", "title": "Thomas Wakley", "text": "Thomas Wakley\n\nThomas Wakley (11 July 1795 – 16 May 1862) was an English surgeon. He gained fame as a social reformer who campaigned against incompetence, privilege and nepotism. He was the founding editor of \"The Lancet\", a radical Member of Parliament (MP) and a celebrated coroner.\n\nHe was born in Membury, Devon, to a prosperous farmer and his wife. His father, Henry Wakley (1750–26 August 1842), inherited property, leased neighbouring land and became a large farmer by the standards of the day and a government Commissioner on the Enclosure of Waste Land. He was described as a 'just but severe parent' and, with his wife, had eleven children, eight sons and three daughters. Thomas was the youngest son, and attended the grammar school at Chard, then Taunton Grammar School. In his early teens, he was apprenticed to a Taunton apothecary. Young Wakley was a sportsman and a boxer: he fought bare-fisted in public houses.\n\nAfter a brief period at sea, he went to London, where he attended anatomy classes at St Thomas's Hospital, and he enrolled in the United Hospitals of St. Thomas's Hospital and Guy's. The dominant personality at these two hospitals was Sir Astley Cooper FRS (1768–1841). Wakley qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) in 1817. A surgeon at 22, he set up in practice in Regent Street and married (1820) Miss Goodchild, whose father was a merchant and a governor of St Thomas' Hospital. They had three sons and a daughter, who died young. His eldest son, Henry Membury Wakley, became a barrister and sat as deputy coroner under his father. His youngest son, James Goodchild Wakley, and his middle son, Thomas Henry Wakley, became joint editors of \"The Lancet\".\n\nAll through his career, Wakley proved to be a man of aggressive personality, and his experiences had a sensational beginning. In August 1820 a gang of men (reputedly, the Thistlewood gang) that had some imagined grievance against him burnt down his house and severely wounded him in a murderous assault. The whole affair is obscure. The assault may have been a follow-up to the Cato Street conspiracy, whose supporters believed (wrongly) that the hangman was a surgeon. Wakley was indirectly accused by the insurance company, which had refused his claim, of setting fire to his house himself. He won his case against the company.\n\nWakley's death, on 16 May 1862 in Madeira, was occasioned by pulmonary haemorrhage after a fall from a boat in the harbour. He had been declining in health for about ten years, and the symptoms are entirely consistent with tuberculosis. Wakley's three sons survived him, and the \"Lancet\" remained in Wakley hands for two more generations. His funeral was a very private affair, attendance restricted to family and close friends: the long-term consequences of his radicalism were eventually appreciated, at least to some extent. Wakley is interred in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery (alcove 59, compartment 13 ) alongside his wife Elizabeth, née Goodchild, (alcove 59, compartment 16), who died three years earlier. There is a blue plaque on his house in Bedford Square, London, and further plaques in the grounds of the Harefield Hospital in Uxbridge, Land Farm in Membury, and Membury parish church .\n\nIn 1823, he started the now well-known medical weekly, \"The Lancet\", with William Cobbett, William Lawrence, James Wardrop and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper, the General Surgeon) of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a bladder stone through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's William Cheselden, but Cooper took more than an hour and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, \"Cooper v Wakley\", which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an acknowledgment that Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.\n\nAt first, the editor of the \"Lancet\" was not named in the journal, but after a few weeks, rumours began to circulate. After the journal began printing the content of Sir Astley Cooper's lectures without permission, the great man paid a surprise visit to his former pupil to discover Wakley correcting the proofs of the next issue. Upon recognising each other, they fell immediately into laughter or perhaps an altercation. Either way, they reached an agreement that was mutually satisfactory.\n\nThe libel lawyer was certainly needed for a series of attacks on the jobbery in vogue among the medical practitioners of the day. In opposition to the hospital surgeons and physicians, he published reports of their lectures and exposed their malpractices. He had to fight a number of lawsuits, but they only increased his influence. He attacked the whole constitution of the Royal College of Surgeons and obtained so much support from among the general body of the profession, now roused to a sense of the abuses that he exposed, that in 1827, a petition to Parliament resulted in a return being ordered of the public money granted to it.\n\nWakley's campaigning was rough and outspoken:\n\nHe was especially severe on whomever he regarded as quacks. The English Homeopathic Association were \"an audacious set of quacks\" and its supporters \"noodles and knaves, the noodles forming the majority, and the knaves using them as tools\".\n\nOne of Wakley's best ideas came in 1831, when a series of massive meetings were held to launch a rival to the Royal Colleges. Though successful, not eventually unsuccessful, and the LCM incorporated ideas that formed the basis of reforms in the charters of the main licensing bodies, the Apothecaries, the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians.\nFirstly, there was to be \"one Faculty\": the LCM was to include physicians, surgeons and general practitioners; teachers at private medical schools and naval surgeons would also be included. Secondly, the structure was to be democratic: there would be no restrictions by religion (e.g. the Anglican restrictions of Oxford and Cambridge Universities) or by institution (e.g. membership of hospitals). Its officers and Senate would be decided by annual ballot. The cost of diplomas would be set low; those already qualified would be eligible to become Fellows so, for instance, those qualified in Scotland would be received without re-examination. Appointments to official (public) positions were to be by merit, eliminating nepotism and the hand-placing of protégées. All Fellows would carry the prefix 'Dr', removing artificial divisions between members.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the LCM did not succeed against the united opposition of the established Colleges and other institutions. Nevertheless, the strong case for reform had been made in the most public manner. Subsequent legislation and reforms in governing charters were, for many years, influenced by this campaign.\n\nIn its early years, the \"Lancet\" also had other content of a non-medical kind. There was a chess column, the earliest regular chess column in any weekly periodical: \"The Chess Table\". There were also occasional articles on politics, theatre reviews, biographies of non-medical persons, excerpts of material in other publications &c. None of that diminished its huge impact on surgery, hospitals and the Royal Colleges, which were opened up to public view as never before. Wakley also played a leading role in the reform of the London Veterinary College and the creation of the Society of Coroners. In addition to his work on The Lancet he also published a number of pamphlets and short guides, including \"The Mother's Medical Adviser\", published by Wilson and Company, New York, 1844.\n\nReform in the College of Surgeons was slow, and Wakley now set himself to rouse the House of Commons from within. He became a radical candidate for Parliament and in 1835 was returned for Finsbury; he retained his seat till 1852. Even after his departure, his work was largely responsible for the content of the Medical Act of 1858. He spoke in the House of Commons against the Poor Laws, police bills, newspaper tax and Lord's Day observance and for Chartism, Tolpuddle Martyrs, free trade, Irish nationalism and, of course, medical reform. All the topics were vigorously debated and fought over, for the 1830s was a turbulent decade; the origin of the difficulties lay in the massively expensive Napoleonic Wars, and in the inherent injustice of the way British law and Parliament operated. The Chartist demands were 1. Universal suffrage for adult men 2. Annual Parliaments 3. Payment for members of Parliament 4. Abolition of property qualifications for candidates 5. Vote by ballot (i.e. secret voting) 6. Abolition of rotten boroughs (rough equalisation of electoral districts). Apart from annual Parliaments, but it took time. The effect was to give ordinary citizens a direct say in how the country was governed. Wakley was one of many campaigners; his influence was greater than most because he was now \"inside\" Parliament.\n\nAs an Anglican and a regular church-goer, Wakley's opposition to aspects of the Lord's Day Observance legislation was based not on secularism but on his sympathy for the ordinary man. In his day, men worked a full six days each week and could not shop on pay nights. If all shops closed for the whole of Sunday, it was clearly unfair to working men. Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, should be open to all on Sundays. The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.\n\nWakley also argued for medical coronerships, and when they were established, he was elected Coroner for West Middlesex in 1839. Consistent with his views, he held inquests into all sudden deaths, including deaths in police custody. He was indefatigable in upholding the interests of the working classes and advocating humanitarian reforms as well as in pursuing his campaign against medical restrictions and abuses, and he made the \"Lancet\" not only a professional organ but a powerful engine of social reform. During his term as coroner he held between 25,000 and 30,000 investigations, sometimes delegating responsibility to his son Henry Membury Wakley. Charles Dickens, a frequent guest at Wakley's dinner table, is said to have derived material for \"Oliver Twist\" from Wakley (inquest on Eliza Burgess, held St. Marylebone Workhouse, January 1840) and was juror on more than one Wakley inquest. Details of many of his cases are held in the reference sections of a number of north and west London reference and local history libraries under the collective title of \"Coroner Wakley's Casebook\" - a series of books published by CB Wakley between 2015 - 2017.\n\nWakley campaigned against flogging as a punishment for many years. Deaths from flogging in the British Army were not unknown and not surprising when one reads the details. Wakley was Coroner when Private James White, after committing a disciplinary offence, was subjected to 150 lashes of the cat-o'-nine-tails in the Seventh Hussars in 1846 and died a month later after symptoms of 'serious cardiac and pulmonary mischief' were followed by pleurisy and pneumonia. The army doctors, under direct pressure from the colonel of the regiment, signed the certificate saying 'cause of death was in no way connected with the corporal punishment'. Before burial, the vicar communicated with Wakley, who issued a warrant for an inquest. Evidence was given by the Army surgeons, by the hospital physician and orderlies and by independent experts. In the event, it was the evidence of Erasmus Wilson, consulting surgeon the St Pancras Infirmary, who made it clear that the flogging and the death were causally connected. The jury concurred and added a strongly worded rider that expressed their 'horror and disgust that the law of the land provided that the revolting punishment of flogging should be permitted upon British soldiers'. Sprigge added that it was not Wilson's able scientific arguments that convinced the jury, but it was his assertion that had it not been for the flogging, White would be alive. The Army Act of 1881 abolished flogging as a punishment.\n\nWakley's last campaigns were against the adulteration of foodstuffs. This was common in Wakley's day, and his opposition was significant in bringing about much-needed reforming legislation. To provide evidence, Wakley set up \"The Lancet Analytical and Sanitary Commission\", which provided 'records of the microscopical and chemical analyses of the solids and fluids consumed by all classes of the public'. The methods were devised by Wakley, Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy and Dr Arthur Hill Hassall, who was the Commissioner.\n\nThe first investigation showed that \"it is a fact that coffee is largely adulterated\". Of 34 coffees, 31 were adulterated; the three exceptions were of higher price. The main adulteration was chicory, otherwise bean-flour, potato-flour or roasted corn was used. Moreover, it was found that chicory itself was usually adulterated. The \"Lancet\" published the names of the genuine traders and threatened the others with exposure if they failed to mend their ways. A second report (26 April 1851) actually carried out the threat. A third report showed that canister coffee was even more adulterated. Investigations of sugar, pepper, bread, tobacco and tea followed, then finally the purity of the water supply. The first Adulteration Act became law in 1860, the second in 1872. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879 followed. All was achieved by Wakley and his associates.\n\n"}

The house was originally built in 1867 by Arthur McMaster, nephew of the prominent businessman William McMaster. At the time Jarvis Street was one of the wealthiest parts of Toronto and the street was lined by large manors. The house was set back from the street and surrounded by large gardens.\n\nThe former house has a neutral colour palette with pops of colour as in the green brass accents over the windows and red shingles on the turret. The hall uses the soft, deep colours to contrast the hard, crisp edges. As a residence, it consisted of twenty six rooms and seventeen fireplaces with a stable and large brick carriage house in the back. With significant alterations to the interior having been made since its era as a dwelling, the interior is now very different from the original.\n\nIn 1882, it was purchased by Hart Massey and his wife who had just returned to Toronto from Cleveland. The Masseys renovated the house and added a turret, verandah, and greenhouse, but the original Gothic façade was not significantly altered. Hart Massey's sons bought homes surrounding the manor. To the north his son Chester D. Massey built the home where Hart's grandchildren Vincent and Raymond were raised.\n\nAs the area became more urban and various commercial operations moved into the area, the Masseys decided to leave. The building was then bequeathed to the University of Toronto's Victoria College in 1915. The manor served as the first home of Toronto radio station CFRB in the 1920s and was home to an art gallery for several decades until 1960. It then became a restaurant named Julie's Mansion. The grounds were sold off and the greenhouses demolished and replaced with a service station. In 1976 it became home to a The Keg restaurant, and it was renamed the Keg Mansion.\n\nOttawa's Keg Manor is located at the Maplelawn historic garden and residence, a 19th-century stone house along the Ottawa River, just off Richmond Road.

The school, which serves grades 6 through 12, is a part of the Arlington Public Schools district.\n\nThe current program is a combination of two earlier programs, Hoffman-Boston, a 7th through 9th grade school founded in 1972 and Woodlawn, a 10th through 12th grade program founded in 1971 by Ray Anderson, Jeffrey Kallen, Bill Hale, and others who felt a pressing need to provide a more individualized, caring environment to students.\n\nWith the alternative education movement in full stride in the late 60s and 70s, there was growing demand for such a school in Arlington. In 1969 Experiments in Free-form Education (EFFE) were conducted at each of the Arlington high schools, in response to the dissatisfaction many students, parents, and teachers had expressed with the current policies. Ray Anderson and Mary McBride were two of the teachers at Wakefield to participate in this program. The following year there was a request from many students for a \"student bill of rights,\" including Jeffrey Kallen, a highly involved student at Washington-Lee. When Ray Anderson announced a proposal to start an alternative school in one of the closing elementary schools, there was overwhelming support. Soon after the Citizen's Committee for the New School was established, a more detailed memorandum was submitted to the school board. By the end of that May, the proposal had been further refined, endorsed by the superintendent, and accepted by the school board. The school was housed in what had been the Woodlawn Elementary School, and what is now the Hospice of Northern Virginia\n\nThe Hoffman-Boston Program (founded in 1972) and the Woodlawn Program (founded in 1971), contained junior high and high school programs respectively, which both embraced the idea of alternative education. Originally, Hoffman-Boston had some 169 students. Woodlawn had 69 students, grades 11 and 12, in its first year of operation, adding 10th grade and expanding to some 169 students the second year. Donald Brandewie was the founding principal of Hoffman-Boston and served for three years, after which Margery Edson became principal. Woodlawn, which was then a haven for \"anti-establishment\" types, had no principal. Ray Anderson served as Head Teacher and served as administrator for the program. \nWith dwindling school populations in Arlington County in the mid-1970s, there was a belief that 9th grade should be moved up from the (then) Junior High Schools to the High Schools. This move would have impacted negatively on the two programs, so a movement started to merge, which was ordered by the School Board to take place in the fall. After a year of careful planning, discussion, and hard work by administration, staff, students, and alumni of the two programs, a comprehensive merger plan and combined philosophy was adopted, and this document served as the \"blueprint\" for the initial years of the combined program. The two schools joined in the former Stratford Junior High School building on Vacation Lane in the fall of 1979. (In an unrelated note, Stratford Junior High School was the first racially integrated school in Arlington, bringing an end to \"Massive Resistance\" in the state in the 1960s). The Stratford Junior High School building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 2014, the Arlington School Board identified a need for additional middle school capacity in the north-central area of the county. After contentious public debate over various options, it was determined that the Stratford building was the best location for a new middle school, and another location would be chosen for H-B Woodlawn. On December 18, 2014 the School Board voted to construct a new building for H-B Woodlawn in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, on property that was formerly home to Wilson School and Rosslyn Highlands Park. The Wilson School was demolished in 2017, and construction began on the new building at 1601 Wilson Blvd. (See side panel for full address). The new building was mostly completed and ready for use in late summer 2019. It featured 7 levels (basement, ground, 1-5), of which the basement and ground floors are underground, with the rest in a fanning shape above ground. Schooling began in the new building in the 2019-2020 school year, starting September 3rd, 2019, with some students happy about the change and others not.\n\nH-B Woodlawn was rated 1st in the 2005 Challenge Index in the area. It received an Equity and Excellence rating of 82.7% that year. In the 2006 survey by Newsweek ranking high schools nationwide, H-B Woodlawn ranked several slots below its previous position - 13 (compared with number 5 in the 2005 survey). In the 2017 Challenge Index, H-B Woodlawn was ranked as the most challenging school in Virginia, and 108 in the nation. \n\nThere is some controversy in ranking H-B Woodlawn nationally as a \"school.\" Students do not actually receive diplomas from H-B Woodlawn, but rather their home schools from around Arlington county.\n\nEvery week there is a \"Town Meeting,\" usually held in the library. Here, students, teachers, and parents alike can vote on important school issues and make announcements to the school. At the beginning of each meeting, students are elected to chair, co-chair and secretary positions. The meeting then follows a modified version of Robert's Rules of Order. The agenda for Town Meeting can include club meeting announcements, organizing upcoming events, future course offerings, school budget allocation, and the hiring of faculty. Anyone in the H-B Woodlawn community is allowed to participate in discussion, and attendance fluctuates based on community interest in agenda items. Participants use a silent method to express agreement and disagreement (the American Sign Language for \"yes\" and \"no,\" respectively).\n\nThe school's motto is Verbum Sap Sat, short for the Latin \"Verbum sapienti sat est\", meaning \"A Word to the Wise is Sufficient.\" \n\nH-B Woodlawn is run on the belief that left with responsibilities, students will learn and get work done. They are given privileges such as going off campus, going to Town Meeting, etc.\n\nAnother tradition is the Teacher/Senior Play, at the beginning of the year, and the Teacher Play, at the end of the year. Since 1971, it has been tradition for the students to interrupt the Head Teacher (now Principal), of not allowing him/her to speak by clapping for roughly five minutes any time the Head Teacher speaks at the school.\n\nBefore Thanksgiving break, H-B's physical education teachers organize the Turkey Bowl, where the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior classes face off in flag football.\n\nOn Halloween, or the nearest school day to it, H-B Woodlawn hosts a costume contest, dancing contest, and student created/led activities around the school.\n\nThe most notable tradition is H-B graduation. It takes place in their gym. It is generally informal (family and friends are encouraged to bring lawn chairs). Each Teacher Advisor presents their graduating seniors and write a two- to five-minute speech about their experience at H-B. This unorthodox practice makes H-B's graduation much longer than most high school graduations. In addition to the speeches, teacher advisers present their students with gag gifts and leis. At the end of graduation (as well as at the end of the year play), H-B's principal, Casey, and other faculty perform renditions of \"Feet of a Dancer\" by Charlie McGettigan. Students are encouraged to sing along.\nThe unofficial school color is Tie Dye, and the unofficial school mascot is a spork.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807036", "title": "Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons", "text": "Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons\n\nRichard Bickerton Pemell Lyons, 1st Earl Lyons (26 April 1817 – 5 December 1887) was an eminent British diplomat, the favourite of Queen Victoria. Lyons was the most influential British diplomat during each of the four great crises of the second half of the 19th century: Italian unification; the American Civil War; the Eastern Question; and the replacement of France by Germany as the dominant Continental power subsequent to German Unification. Lyons is best known for solving the Trent Affair during the American Civil War; for laying the foundations for the Special Relationship and the Entente Cordiale; and for predicting, 32 years before World War One, the occurrence of an imperial war between France and Germany that would destroy Britain's international dominance.\n\nHe served as British Ambassador to the United States from 1858 to 1865, during the American Civil War; British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1865 to 1867; and British Ambassador to France from 1867 to 1887, which was then the most prestigious position in the Civil Service. Famous for his tact, equability towards foreign peoples, staunchness, stoicism, and opulent dinner parties, Lyons was offered the Cabinet position of Foreign Secretary on three separate occasions, by three separate Prime Ministers (Gladstone, Disraeli, Salisbury) and encouraged to accept the post by Queen Victoria, but declined the offer on all three occasions. Lyons was a Francophile, and, although he maintained nominal party neutrality, an advocate of the Tory Party and monarchist whose sympathies were closest to those of 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, his closest political ally.\n\nLyons – who was distrusted by Gladstonian Liberals as a 'Tory-leaning diplomat' – founded the Tory-sympathetic 'Lyons School' of British diplomacy: which consisted of Sir Edwin Egerton; Sir Maurice de Bunsen; Sir Michael Herbert; Sir Edward Baldwin Malet; Sir Frank Lascelles; Sir Gerard Lowther; Sir Edmund Monson, 1st Baronet; and Sir Nicholas O'Conor. Lyons's biographer Jenkins (2014), in the most recent biography of Lyons, considers him to be the exemplar of the British diplomat, of the ‘Foreign Office mind’, who created a canon of practical norms of British imperial diplomacy, including the necessity for neutrality in domestic party politics and the necessity for extensive confidential correspondence with various Cabinet ministers.\n\nLyons was the eldest son of Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons; the cousin of Sir Algernon Lyons, Admiral of the Fleet and First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria; and the cousin of Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nRichard Bickerton Pemell was born in Lymington, Hampshire, on 26 April 1817. His father was Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons and his mother was Augusta Louisa, née Rogers. His siblings were: Anne Theresa Bickerton Lyons (1815–1894), Baroness von Würtzburg; Captain Edmund Moubray Lyons (1819–1855); and Augusta Mary Minna Catherine Lyons (1821–1886), Duchess of Norfolk and grandmother of Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian. Lyons's cousins included Sir Algernon Lyons, Admiral of the Fleet and Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nLyons, who was a descendant of a Norman family, was an ardent Francophile, although a monarchist, who throughout his diplomatic career 'desired Anglo-French cooperation at any price'; had 'a perceptive assessment of the French collective psyche'; and was 'ever ready to exculpate French behaviour'.\n\nRichard Bickerton was tutored at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, by Sir John Colborne, in classics, English, French, arithmetic, writing, and theology, where he received a Latin Prize in 1828. He and all three of his siblings accompanied their father and mother to Valletta, Malta, in 1828, where they were homeschooled in the works of Enlightenment philosophy, including those of William Robertson, astrology, history, and the classics, in addition to French and Modern Greek, in both of which he developed fluency. After an initial tour of the Aegean, his father returned to Valletta to refit his ship, HMS Blonde, before sailing again for the Aegean on 30 January 1829: on this second journey, he took his two sons. The two sons were tutored on the boat, explored Greece on excursions into the mainland, and were introduced to prominent members of society. Richard Bickerton returned to England to attend Winchester College. He subsequently attended Christ Church, Oxford, at which he graduated BA, in 1838, and MA, in 1843. He later, in 1865, received an honorary DCL from Oxford. By the time at which he had begun his diplomatic career, he possessed, like his father, a mastery of several languages.\n\nRichard Lyons entered the diplomatic service in 1839, when Lord Palmerston appointed him as an unpaid attaché at his father's legation in Athens. In this position, Lyons advocated and sought to implemented, under the authority of his father and his father's direct successor, Thomas Wyse, policies conducive to the establishment of a stable constitutional monarchy that would not impede an Ottoman Empire which served as a bulwark against Russian expansion in the British-dominated Mediterranean.\n\nIn Athens, Lyons developed the framework of diplomatic conduct for which he would become famous. He realised that a diplomat was able to win the loyalty of his subordinates with informal hospitality and courtesy, and by consulting them on matters of business. In Athens, Lyons cultivated a family atmosphere: he dined with his juniors several times per week, provided for their welfare, and sought to ease their workloads. He received their loyalty in return.\n\nIt was also in Athens that Lyons decided that British embassies should impress the power of the British Empire, and that opulent dinners with foreign diplomats created amicable relationships.\n\nIn 1844, Lyons was made a paid attaché and transferred to Dresden, Saxony. He then served as Ambassador to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nLyons was subsequently appointed, by Lord John Russell, as an unofficial representative of Britain to the Papal States. In this office, Lyons was expected to pursue the reform of the unpopular Papal government. Lyons's analyses of the issues, his clarity in his dispatches, and the integrity of his counsel made him admired at the Foreign Office. Russell was impressed with Lyons's achievement of regaining the favour and of the Papal authorities for Protestant Britain, which had enabled Lyons to dissuade the Vatican from the pursuit of the establishment of a Catholic hierarchy in Scotland, which might have caused Anti-Catholic sedition in Britain. Lyons achieved this restoration of favourable relations with the Vatican by refusing to condemn actions, however disagreeable to him, that Britain had no ability to prevent. Lord Russell was so impressed with Lyons that, when Russell succeeded to the Foreign Office in 1859, he urged his nephew, Odo, who had succeeded Lyons in Rome, to imitate the policies and conduct of Lyons.\n\nBetween 1856 and 1858, Lyons was Secretary of the British Legation at Florence. He was the British Minister at Florence between February 1858 and December 1858.\n\nLyons's first major appointment came in December 1858 when he succeeded Lord Napier as British envoy to the United States in Washington.\n\nOne month previously, Lyons had succeeded to his father's titles: he arrived in the United States, two years before the outbreak of the American Civil War, as 2nd Baronet and 2nd Baron Lyons, of Christchuch, Hampshire. He would later receive the higher noble titles of Viscount (1881) and Earl (1887).\n\nThe British Government considered Lyons to be the best choice for the position of Ambassador to the United States. However, US President James Buchanan, ignorant of Lyons's precocious ability, was unhappy with the appointment as a consequence of Lord Lyons's young age and his few years as a diplomat: Buchanan stated that he wanted a “man whose character was known in this country.\" It is likely that Buchanan was anxious because both of Lyons's predecessors at Washington, (Napier and Crampton), had been recalled because of scandals. Lyons considered President Buchanan to be thoroughly inept and described him as ‘too weak to wring his hands’.\n\nLord Lyons contended that the British ‘were the chosen people of history’ and his political sympathies were monarchical. However, he was unprejudiced towards Americans and French, towards whom he behaved with unfailing equanimity, to an unprecedented degree. In America, he was ‘witty and erudite’, ‘tactful and discreet to the point of parody, and possessed ‘a subtle intelligence and a steely resolve’.\n\nGeoffrey Madan records Lyons as the author of two somewhat surprising aphorisms:\n\n\nLord Lyons detested displays of emotion: according to Lord Newton, ‘he [Lyons] had never been in debt, never gambled, never quarrelled, never as far as was known, ever been in love’ and he detested outdoor life, exercise, and sport. Lord Lyons became famous for his luxurious dinner parties, both when Ambassador to the United States and when Ambassador to Paris. Lyons's dinner parties ‘nothing could exceed’ in ‘dignity and faultless taste’. He loved gastronomy, agreed with Palmerston's remark that ‘dining is the soul of diplomacy’, and offered at least five courses of Moet and Chandon champagne at his diplomatic dinners because he found that it made United States senators more pliant.\n\nJenkins states that Lyons sought to create, amongst each ambassadorial community within which he served, the structure of ‘a boys school of which he were the headmaster’. Lyons contended that British legations and embassies should impress the notion of Britain's grandeur by splendour of furnishings and banquets, but his banquets were not exclusive: he often invited junior members of the diplomatic community.\n\nLord Lyons resolved the San Juan Island crisis in 1859 (the \"Pig War\") by ignoring his orders and showing to the United States, in secret and informally, the ultimatum that he had been instructed to deliver to them: this enabled the United States to realize the position of Britain and thereby enabled an agreement to be reached before the animosity engendered violence.\n\nLyons regularly attended Willard's Hotel, a centre of political gossip, to covertly discern the opinions of American notables.\n\nLyons planned and organized the successful tour, in 1860, of British North America and the United States by the Prince of Wales, of whom he was a close personal friend until his death. Lyons chose a route that included the centres of Republican Party sentiment in New York, Massachusetts, and Ohio, and included meetings with the politicians Sumner and Chase. For this tour, Lord Lyons received the praise of both the United States, including that of President Buchanan, and that of Great Britain, including that of Queen Victoria. As a consequence of these two successes, Lyons was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).\n\nA few weeks after the prince's tour, in November 1860, following the election of Abraham Lincoln to the U.S. presidency, the deepening rift between the nation's slave states and free states erupted into a Secession Crisis. As he wrote in a letter to Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell, Lyons initially considered it \"impossible that the South can be mad enough to dissolve the Union.\" However, as the conflict intensified, Lyons revised his opinion. He foresaw an increasingly bloody conflict in which the Union would prevail, but after which the Union would disintegrate as a consequence of internal animosities. Lyons considered Lincoln's policy of reunion to be inept, and preferred a policy of peaceful separation.\n\nHe advocated British non-intervention and instructed his staff to be neutral with dealings with both North and South, and had a network of covert spies reporting on the activities of each side. He considered Lincoln to be a social nobody and an unrefined westerner, and considered U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward to be an anti-British exhibitionist. He thus feared that American politicians would attempt to distract public attention from domestic problems by increasing their attacks on foreign powers, such as Britain. He also rigorously pursued negotiations intended to preclude the occurrence of a conflict between Britain and either the North or the South, and advocated the continual rejection of French invitations for Britain to join in joint-intervention with France. Lyons successfully resolved numerous other issues, such as the defence of Canada, which he believed would be the first foreign target for a Union military offensive. Among his sources for information concerning this potential threat were the Royal Engineers, who undertook multiple intelligence-gathering operation across the Canada–United States border during the war. \n\nHe was prepared to destabilise the Union, and recognise Confederate independence, in order to ensure the security of the cotton supply to Britain, from the Confederacy, after Lincoln's decision to order a blockade of the southern coast. However, he also worked to develop a personal friendship with Seward to provide for the eventuality, which proceeded to arise, in which British favour for the North was in Britain's best interests. Lyons wanted to create what he called a \"golden bridge\" that would enable the Union to retract the policies that damaged the British cotton trade without humiliating itself. In the words of Jenkins, \"by sidestepping questions of principle, he [Lyons] avoided a collision and reached an understanding with Seward.\"\n\nLyons maintained such a convincing semblance of genuine honesty that, after the Civil War, the Union praised him for his honesty. Lyons's stratagem so deceived Seward that Seward was led, by his perception of Lyons's apparent honesty, to consider an Anglo-American special relationship to be a possibility. In Britain, Lyons's deceptive powers led the Foreign Office to consider him to be 'one of Britain's most intelligent and skilful diplomats'. Lyons believed, in the words of Jenkins, that the Union \"had to be disabused of the notion that there was no limit to his nation's [Britain's] forbearance.\"\n\nLyons's most famous diplomatic success, whilst Ambassador to the United States, was the resolution of the Trent Affair, during the autumn of 1861, in which two politicians from the South, (James Mason and John Slidell) who had been sent to Europe to attempt to secure formal recognition for the Confederacy, were abducted from the neutral British mail steamer, \"Trent\" which was intercepted by a vessel from the Northern States. This stimulated the animosity of the British public and war between Britain and the United States seemed imminent, but, through idiosyncratic ‘tact and firmness’, Lyons compelled the United States government to release the two envoys, and the likely conflict was averted. Lyons achieved this by two actions: first, he deliberately withheld the official statement of the British response for an extended period after the date on which he was ordered to give it, in order to make the Americans distressed by the uncertainty; second, during the later stages of this period, he used the same technique that he had used, successfully, to resolve the San Juan Crisis: he disclosed to the Americans, without British authorization, and in a manner that suggested the disclosure were an accident, a version of the British policy that deliberately overstated the severity of the British keenness to use force, a number of days before issuing the official British response.\n\nFor this victory, Queen Victoria stated that she would be pleased for Lyons to ‘represent Her at any court in the world’.\n\nFor this victory, Raymond Jones has described Lyons as ‘Britain's greatest mid-century ambassador.’\n\nIn December 1864, Lord Lyons left Washington, suffering poor health. Before he left, Lyons had amiable final meetings with Abraham Lincoln and Seward, both of whom wished for his rapid convalescence and his return to the position of British Ambassador at Washington. However, Lyons's health deteriorated further and, in the spring of 1865, compelled Lyons to resign his position as Ambassador to the United States. Queen Victoria and the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, attempted to persuade Lyons to return to Washington, but he would not. Lyons nominated Sir Frederick Bruce as his successor: the Queen and Palmerston immediately accepted his suggestion, demonstrating their possession of the utmost confidence in Lyons' ability to read the diplomatic situation.\n\nAfter his resignation, Queen Victoria remarked to Palmerston that she was so pleased by Lyons' service in the United States that she would be happy to have Lyons \"represent Her at any Court\" in the world. Victoria considered Lyons to have a ‘sterling reputation for integrity’.\n\nThree Volumes of Lyons's American Civil War despatches were published in 2005.\n\nSubsequent to his resignation from the position of Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lyons served as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople, for a period of less than two years. He replaced Sir Henry Bulwer, who was embroiled in a humiliating scandal: despite the fact that the Ottoman Government had bought Bulwer an island estate, several thousand pounds had disappeared from the Embassy Accounts. In contradistinction, the new Foreign Secretary, Lord Clarendon was confident that Lord Lyons was an ‘honest man’ who would easily restore amicable Anglo-Ottoman relations: Lyons did so within two years. In this position, Lyons forecast that the Ottoman Empire would disintegrate, and he advocated a policy of British defence of the Ottoman Empire's territory only until the point at which the implementation of this policy would entail British military involvement, at which, he contended, British support should cease.\n\nLyons successfully persuaded the Court of the Sublime Porte to decline to make concessions to France that would have provided for French control of the Suez Canal, which was an important route for the British supply of the Indian Empire.\n\nLyons's success was impeded by the injury that Bismarck had inflicted on British credibility during the crisis of Schleswig-Holstein. Lyons responded by cajoling the French Minister into a partnership with himself: this provided for the resolution of the issue of the Danubian Principalities in a manner amenable to British interests. Lyons's success at Constantinople recovered the Ottoman favour for Britain that had been lost by his predecessors: as a consequence, he was appointed to the most senior position in the diplomatic service, British Minister to France.\n\nIn October 1867, after the resignation of Lord Cowley, Lord Lyons was appointed to the most prestigious position in the British Diplomatic Service: British Ambassador to France, at Paris. The twenty years Lyons spent in Paris coincided with a crucial period in French history which included the last years of the Second French Empire, the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris Commune, the establishment of the Third Republic and the beginning of the Boulanger crisis, which threatened to destruct the republican settlement. Lyons served in this position for a continuous period of twenty years, making him one of the longest serving occupants of the position. He was also one of the most successful: Lyons maintained absolute political neutrality, which he considered to be an imperative quality for a diplomat, that enabled him to develop amicable relationships with Liberal ministers to whose political sympathies he was fundamentally averse: according to Jenkins, ‘the presence of such a reliable and conciliatory man in the most sensitive and important post in Europe gave both Liberal and Conservative British Governments an essential guarantee that their instructions would always be carried out according to the terms determined in London’. The fact that Lyons remained absolutely politically neutral demonstrates that his promotion to the highest ambassadorial rank, by the Tories, was a consequence of '[his] professional not political considerations'.\n\nWhen Lyons arrived in Paris during the last months of 1867, at the height of the Paris Exhibition, the Second French Empire was stable. Lyons was entrusted by Napoleon III, but considered Napoleon's war with Prussia to be idiotic, and predicted, again correctly, that it would culminate in the destruction of the French Empire.\n\nLyons's correspondence provides valuable contemporaneous commentary on the siege of Paris, on the insurgency of the Paris Commune, on the transfer of political power to Germany, and on the various inept French attempts to establish a stable polity. Before Paris was invested, Lyons arranged an\ninterview between Otto von Bismarck and M. Jules Favre, but it failed to resolve the problem. During the investment of Paris, Lyons, to secure a position in which he would be able to continue to report to the British Government, departed for Tours, and subsequently to Bourdeaux, along with ministers of the French provisional government. Lyons was criticised in the House of Commons for identifying absolutely with the Provisional Government, but his action was correct, and his critics erroneous, because England had already recognised the Provisional Government as the de facto government.\n\nLyons advocated the restoration of French military power because he believed that it would restore the balance of power on the Continent. Lyons worked unceasingly to create secure British relations with France, but his actions were met with French aversion to Britain: though Lyons had succeeded to the office as a Francophile, he had lost the favour with which he had considered the French by the time of his resignation.\n\nWhen travelling through Paris, Queen Victoria often stayed to spend time with Lyons.\n\nLord Lyons did not consider parliamentary democracy to be a viable system for France. He favoured powerful leaders, such as Napoleon III and Léon Gambetta, believing that only such were able to pacify French society, which was necessary for the perpetuation of the French entente with Britain and its adherence to a free-trade policy.\n\nThe later years of Lyons's tenure in France included those in which the Eastern Question determined international policy; those in which France invaded Tunisia and pursued imperial expansion; and those in which the Egyptian Question became an important issue. As the response to all of these issues, Lord Lyons advocated a close association, in international politics, between France and Britain: prophetically, Lyons advocated policies that he thought would prevent a conflict between France and Germany, which he forecast, and that, therefore, would secure the perpetuation of British dominance within Europe. Subsequent to the British Action in Egypt in the summer of 1882, and the formal abolition of the dual rule in Egypt, Lyons became inextricably involved in a confrontation between Britain and France that lasted until 1904: he worked diligently to ease it, but with little success, although his characteristic quality of gracefulness towards those whose interests were antithetical to the British interest, of which his defence was absolute, prevented the antipathy from evolving into animosity. Unlike many members of the British Government, Lyons contended that Britain should, having established its authority over Egypt, not withdraw from the task into which she had entered herself: he advocated a British reform of Egyptian finances and a British observance of French financial rights in Egypt.\n\nLyons's competence in France led the Prime Minister, Salisbury, with the support of Queen Victoria, to offer Lyons the position of Foreign Secretary, on the formation of the second Salisbury administration, in 1886: this was the third occasion on which Lyons had been offered the Foreign Office, and for the third time, Lyons declined.\n\nLyons, who had inherited the titles of 2nd Baronet and 2nd Baron Lyons subsequent to the death of his father, Edmund Lyons, in 1858, also received the higher noble titles of Viscount, in 1881, and Earl, in 1887, though he died before he had been formally invested with the latter.\nLyons agreed to remain Ambassador to France until the close of 1887: this was against his wishes, but according to those of Salisbury. Lyons finally relinquished this post in October 1887, whereupon it was to be declared that he was to be raised from Viscount to Earl. Lyons was succeeded as Ambassador to France by the Earl of Lytton, who had been his Secretary whilst he had served in the post.\n\nLyons was exhausted by the time of his retirement: he had served as an Ambassador to the world's most important courts for a continuous period of 50 years. In November, one month after his retirement, he suffered a severe stroke that rendered him paralysed and incapacitated: on 5 December, he died, at Norfolk House, the residence of his nephew, Duke of Norfolk. Lyons was never able to enjoy the retirement which he had intended to begin.\n\nIn 1886, Lyons's sister, the Duchess of Norfolk, died. Lyons had devoted the first two weeks of his retirement to the study of Catholicism, had received permission from the Prime Minister to attend Mass, and had expressed his desire to convert to Catholicism. He had not converted to Catholicism by the time of his stroke/seizure, which paralysed and incapacitated him to the extent that ‘it is extremely doubtful to what extend he retained consciousness’: however, the Bishop of Southwark, Dr. Butt, with whom Lyons had had several conversations about Catholicism in the short period between the beginning of his retirement and his loss of consciousness, ‘felt so convinced of his [Lyons’s] disposition and intention that he received [Lyons] into the [Catholic] Church and administered to him extreme unction’ whilst Lyons lay unconscious and unable to communicate. Lyons was not conscious for the rite and never regained consciousness: he was, however, in the way aforementioned, converted.\n\nLord Lyons died before he had formally received the title of Earl: however, because the notice of his possession of this title had appeared in the \"London Gazette\", he is usually, nevertheless, termed 1st Earl Lyons, as in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, the Dictionary of National Biography, and the American Civil War, Round Table UK Profile.\n\nLyons never married and died without issue. His only brother had predeceased him, without issue, in 1855. All of Earl Lyons's titles became extinct on his death. He left the possessions and decorations of his father, Edmund, 1st Baron Lyons, to the Dukes of Norfolk, in the hope that they would be kept at Arundel Castle.\n\nLord Lyons's funeral occurred on 10 December 1887 at the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle. He is buried under the Chapel, which is the burial ground of the traditionally Catholic Dukes of Norfolk. His sister, the Duchess of Norfolk, her husband, the 14th Duke, and his father, Edmund, 1st Baron Lyons, are buried alongside him.\n\nNumerous members of the British aristocracy attended the funeral at the Fitzalan Chapel. Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales, Gustave de Rothschild, Alphonse James de Rothschild, and Edmond James de Rothschild sent floral tributes.\n\nLord Lyons's 1887 obituary in \"The Morning Post\" describes him as ‘the idea of a pattern and ideal diplomatist’ who ‘knew the contents of every modern dispatch’ ‘by heart’. Lyons attained the height of his influence during the premierships of his close political ally 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who offered him the position of Foreign Secretary in 1886. He was always distrusted by Gladstonian Liberals for being a 'Tory-leaning diplomat', and there were complaints that the Lyons-trained Foreign Office during the Salisbury premierships had been packed with Tories.\n\nIn the 21st century, including by his biographer Brian Jenkins (2014), by T. G. Otte (2011), and by Scott Cairns (2004), Lyons has been identified as the progenitor of a Tory-sympathetic 'Lyons School' of British diplomacy: which consisted of Sir Edwin Egerton; Sir Maurice de Bunsen; Sir Michael Herbert; Sir Edward Baldwin Malet; Sir Frank Lascelles; Sir Gerard Lowther; Sir Edmund Monson, 1st Baronet; and Sir Nicholas O'Conor. Lyons's biographer Jenkins (2014), in the most recent biography of Lyons, considers him to be the exemplar of the British diplomat, of the ‘Foreign Office mind’, who created a canon of practical norms of British imperial diplomacy, including the necessity for neutrality in domestic party politics and the necessity for extensive confidential correspondence with various Cabinet ministers.\n\nThrough his nephew, the Duke of Norfolk, Lyons was the great-granduncle of the writer Maisie Ward, and the great-great-granduncle of the translator Rosemary Sheed and the writer Wilfred Sheed.\n\nLyons appears briefly as a character in the alternative history novel \"Guns of the South\" by Harry Turtledove. He also appears in the Southern Victory Series novel also by Turtledove, where he was a diplomat who was sent to Washington, D.C. after the Battle of Camp Hill to advise Abraham Lincoln that the United Kingdom and France were set to offer recognition to the Confederate, and that if the U.S. did not do the same, Britain would defend the C.S. by use of its military. This, in addition to the claim of the Lord Lyons character that he envisioned a time where both the U.S. and C.S. would \"stand together, [as] a pair of sturdy brothers,\" is historically untrue. He was also a minor character in the historical novel \"Freedom\" by William Safire.\n\n\n"}

Congressional passage of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act in 1962 authorized the White House to conduct mutual tariff negotiations, ultimately leading to the Kennedy Round. Participation greatly increased over previous rounds. Sixty-six nations, representing 80% of world trade, attended the official opening on May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. Despite several disagreements over details, the director general announced the round’s success on May 15, 1967, and the final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967—the very last day permitted under the Trade Expansion Act. The round was named after U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated six months before the opening negotiations.\n\nThe main objectives of the Kennedy Round were to:\n\nThe European trade integration signaled by the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the 1957 Treaty of Rome led the United States to fear its own products would be shut out of the European market. Thus, President Kennedy pressed for the passage of the Trade Expansion Act, which gave the president authority to decrease duties up to 50% from their 1962 levels or increase them up to 50% from their 1934 levels. The window for this increased authority was after June 30, 1962, and before July 1, 1967. Trade adjustment assistance was considered within the act with several provisions that provided for the financial and technical assistance to firms and workers adversely affected by the opening of trade. It also made provisions for treating the EEC as a single trade partner and made special provisions for any trade agreements covering agricultural commodities. After the act was passed, the administration pressed for a new round of multilateral trade talks to utilize its new authority, which would become known as the Kennedy Round upon the death of President Kennedy in November 1963.\n\nThe Kennedy Round officially opened on May 4, 1964, at the Palais des Nations. It was the last GATT round to have tariff reduction as its primary focus. However, it was the first GATT round to deal with non-tariff issues, such as dumping, a practice whereby a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it charges in its home market. It notably also pioneered a \"linear\" style of negotiations. In contrast to the item-by-item negotiations of previous GATT rounds, many countries offered across-the-board cuts of a certain percentage on all tariffs of participating countries. Members of the so-called \"Bridge Club\"—the United States, European Economic Community, Japan, and the UK—led the negotiations and offered linear cuts. Six other European countries joined them in linear cuts. Another 36 countries were nonlinear participators, a difference which led to tension within the negotiations, as linear countries often felt nonlinear countries had no right to participate in the \"confrontation and justice\" procedure for dealing with proposed exceptions. Thus, although the Kennedy Administration had originally contemplated finishing the round in six months, the round was plagued with delays and slow progress. In addition to the linear and nonlinear divides, disputes arose over agricultural policy and tariff disparities. The United States wanted Europe to agree to cut farm tariffs before moving on to industrial tariffs, but gridlock forced the United States to relent. Only low expectations stopped the concluding agricultural agreements from being considered a disaster. Further, equivalent percentage cuts to high U.S. tariffs (18% on average) and medium EEC tariffs (12% on average ) were seen to favor the United States. Since President Lyndon Johnson had little chance of success in reauthorizing the Trade Expansion Act, its July 1, 1967 deadline served as the effective deadline for the Kennedy round. After a marathon session, negotiators announced a satisfactory agreement at a midnight meeting with the press on May 15, 1967. The final agreement was signed on June 30, 1967. However, within the United States, Congress repealed several provisions of the round of global tariff cuts, hurting the future credibility of the United States in worldwide trade negotiations.\n\nU.S. tariff concessions involved $8.5 billion worth of goods, and foreign tariff concessions on imports from the United States involved $8.1 billion. 64% of non-agricultural dutiable imports were covered by U.S. linear cuts, with an average tariff reduction of 35%. Foreign tariff reductions were on average 34%, and covered 48% of their non-agricultural dutiable imports. Non-tariff achievements included the establishment of the GATT Antidumping Code of 1967, which gave a procedural framework for negotiating dumping accusations and expanded upon the original Article VI in GATT. The round can also be seen as a success for developing nations. A \"Trade and Development\" section was added to the GATT charter; its most significant feature was exempting developing nations from the rule of reciprocity. It also called for the stabilization of raw material prices. Further, the agricultural grains arrangement provided for higher minimum trading prices as well as a food aid program to developing countries. Some progress was also made with negotiations on commodities. The round extended the Long Term Cotton Textile Arrangement for another three years and provided frameworks for negotiating steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp, and paper tariffs.\n\nGeneral protectionist criticisms have been made of the round. In voting to withdraw from the WTO in 2000, Congressman Jack Metcalf cited the Kennedy round as the beginning of \"the slow decline in Americans’ living standards\" and that all such multilateral agreements \"may mesmerize and motivate Washington policymakers, but in the American heartland...translate as further efforts to promote international order at the expense of existing American jobs\". However, the round also has economically liberal critics, who believe that it did not achieve as liberal of goals as the tariff cuts suggest and instead, out of political fears, erected non-tariff barriers to protect domestic industries from the negative effects of trade.\n\n\n"}

This lady was the niece of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and her husband was thus attached to the Lancastrian party, but he did not follow Thomas of Lancaster in the proceedings which led to his death in 1322. Hating the favourites of Edward II, Wake joined Queen Isabella in 1326 and was a member of the small council which advised the young king, Edward III; soon, however, he broke away from the queen and her ally, Roger Mortimer, and in conjunction with his father-in-law, now earl of Lancaster, he joined the malcontent barons.\n\nHe was possibly implicated in the plot which cost his brother-in-law, Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, his life in 1330, and he fled to France, returning to England after the overthrow of Isabella and Mortimer. Edward III made him governor of the Channel Islands and he assisted Edward Balliol to invade Scotland, being afterwards sent on an errand to France. In 1341 he incurred the displeasure of the king and was imprisoned, but he had been restored and had been employed in Brittany and elsewhere when he died childless.\n\nHis estates passed to his sister Margaret (d. 1349), widow of Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent, then to her son John (d. 1352), and later to her daughter Joan who became 4th Countess of Kent. Through Joan of Kent's marriage to Thomas Holland the title and estates were passed down to the Holland family. Wake founded a monastery Haltemprice Priory for the Austin canons at Newton near Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire where he is buried.\n\n"}

It published a mix of erotic fiction and avant-garde literary fiction, and is best known for the first print of Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\".\n\nIt specialized in books which could not be published (without legal action) in the English-speaking world, and correctly assumed that the French, who were unable to read the books, and were more sexually tolerant, would leave them alone. They were books to buy if your travels took you through Paris.\n\nPrecisely 94 Olympia Press publications were promoted and packaged as \"Traveller's Companion\" books, usually with simple text-only covers, and each book in the series was numbered. The \"Ophelia Press\" line of erotica was far larger, using the same design, but pink covers instead of green.\n\nOlympia Press was the first publisher willing to print William S. Burroughs's avant-garde, sexually explicit \"Naked Lunch\", which soon became famous. Other notable works included J. P. Donleavy's \"The Ginger Man\"; Samuel Beckett's French trilogy \"Molloy\", \"Malone Dies\", and \"The Unnamable\"; Henry Miller's trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion, consisting of Sexus, Nexus and Plexus; \"A Tale of Satisfied Desire\" by Georges Bataille; \"Story of O\" by Pauline Réage; Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg's \"Candy\"; and a critical book on Scientology, \"Inside Scientology/Dianetics\" by Robert Kaufman. The South African poet Sinclair Beiles was an editor at the publisher. Other authors included Alexander Trocchi, Iris Owens (Harriet Daimler) and John Stevenson (Marcus Van Heller).\n\nGirodias had troubled dealings with his authors including copyright issues; Nabokov was not satisfied with the publisher and its reputation, and another long-running dispute over the rights to \"The Ginger Man\" ended with Donleavy's then-wife Mary buying out Girodias at what was intended to be a closed auction. Having to leave France because he managed to annoy powerful people, Girodias briefly reestablished Olympia Press in New York in the 1960s, and in London in the early 1970s.\n\nGrove Press in the U.S. would later print \"The Olympia Reader,\" a best-selling anthology containing material from some of Olympia's most popular works, including material by Burroughs, Miller, Trocchi and others. Another well-known collection was \"The Best of Olympia\", first published by the Olympia Press in 1963 and reprinted by New English Library in 1966.\n\nOther incarnations of the company, some with Girodias' support, emerged in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Olympia Press has been re-established and is currently operating out of Washington, London, and Frankfurt.\n\n"}

Cusack became a national school teacher, and after teaching in various parts of Ireland became a professor in 1874 in Blackrock College, then known as the French College. In 1877, Cusack established his own Civil Service Academy, 'Cusack's Academy' in Dublin which proved successful in preparing pupils for the civil service examinations.\n\nA romantic nationalist, Cusack was also \"reputed\" to have been associated with the Fenian movement. He was active in the Gaelic revival: a member of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language which was founded in 1876, and later the Gaelic League who in 1879 broke away from the Society. Also in 1879, Cusack met Pat Nally, who was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a leading nationalist and athlete. Cusack found that Nally's views on the influence of British landlordism on Irish athletics were the same as his. Cusack would recall how both Nally and himself while walking through the Phoenix Park in Dublin seeing only a handful of people playing sports in the park so depressed them that they agreed it was time to \"make an effort to preserve the physical strength of [their] race.\" Nally organised a National Athletics Sports meeting in County Mayo in September 1879 which was a success, with Cusack organising a similar event which was open to 'artisans' in Dublin the following April.\n\nOn 1 November 1884, Cusack together with Maurice Davin, of Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, called a meeting in Hayes' Commercial Hotel, Thurles, County Tipperary, and founded the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Davin was elected president and Cusack became its first secretary. Later, Archbishop Thomas William Croke (May 28, 1824 - July 22, 1902), Archbishop of Cashel & Emly, Michael Davitt and Charles Stewart Parnell became patrons. Cusack also became involved in the Irish language movement, founding The Celtic Times, a weekly newspaper which focused on 'native games' and Irish culture.\n\nCusack died in Dublin on 27 November 1906 at the age of 59.\n\nThe newly opened Michael Cusack Visitor Centre located on the original homestead in Poulaphuca townland, Carran, The Burren, County Clare is dedicated to recounting the fascinating story of Michael Cusack and the idealism which led to him founding the Gaelic Athletic Association.\n\nThe bigoted character of \"The Citizen\" in James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\" is thought to have been at least in part based on what has been described as \"a jaundiced portrait of Michael Cusack\".\n\nThe Clare GAA pitch in Ennis, and the Westmeath GAA pitch in Mullingar, are both named \"Cusack Park\" in his honour, as is the \"Cusack Stand\" in Croke Park, Dublin.\n\nThe primary school Gaelscoil Mhíchíl Cíosóg in Ennis, County Clare, is also named after him.\n\nMichael Cusacks's Sydney GAA Club was founded in 1988 by a group of Clare men and was named in honour of the man from Carran.\n\nChicago Michael Cusack Hurling Club is a GAA club consisting entirely of American-born players founded in 2008.\n\nA small collection of family papers was donated to the James Hardiman Library, NUI Galway, by his grandniece, Patricia O'Connell.

For most of his career he has been known as either Cyrus (shortened from Cyrus the Virus) or Don Callis. He first gained international attention working under the name The Jackyl working for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Callis is currently Impact Wrestling's co-executive vice president. He also worked for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as an English language commentator on NJPW World.\n\nWhile in the WWF Callis managed a group known as The Truth Commission and later on The Oddities and finally The Acolytes before being fired in 1999. From 1999 to 2001, he worked for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) strictly as a manager and fictional \"network representative\" in various ECW storylines. While in ECW he led a group known as The Network. In 2003, he was introduced as an onscreen character for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and returned to the company (now called \"Impact Wrestling\") in 2017 where he took an executive position as well as an on-screen commentator.\n\nCallis was trained by Manitoba wrestling promoter Tony Condello, debuting in 1989 in Condello's West Four Wrestling Alliance promotion under his birth name. Later that year, Callis adopted the ring name \"The Natural\". In May 1991, Callis won the WFWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship. Between 1991 and 1994, he held the championship a total of four times. In 1994, the West Four Wrestling Alliance was renamed the International Wrestling Alliance. Callis held the IWA Heavyweight Championship twice in 1996.\n\nIn 1992, Callis wrestled for the Quebec-based Lutte Lanaudière as \"The General\", teaming with El Diablero as \"The Jet Set Team\". The Jet Set Team held the Lutte Lanaudière Tag Team Championship for eight months.\n\nCallis received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996 and was eventually hired to form a tag team with Rick Martel as 'The Models'. When Martel departed for WCW, he was left without a gimmick.\n\nOn September 20, 1997, Callis debuted in the WWF as \"The Jackyl\", a member (and eventually leader) of a group of wrestlers known as \"The Truth Commission\" (a take on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission). An article in \"WWF Magazine\" claimed that he was a lower-level WWF employee during the early 1990s, and that he developed a messianic complex when he led a group of WWF superstars out of Kuwait when they were stranded there during the Gulf War. In an effort to play up the Jackyl's gimmick as a charismatic, power-hungry fanatic, commentator Jim Ross often referred to him as the \"David Koresh of the World Wrestling Federation\". The Jackyl sometimes would compete in singles matches mainly on Shotgun Saturday Night and house shows. Once the Jackyl fought in his hometown, Winnipeg, as the General, against Jim Neidhart and lost the match. He would also team up with and managed the Interrogator (Kurrgan). The stable was not particularly successful, with their biggest achievement being their victory over the Disciples of Apocalypse at Survivor Series 1997. At WrestleMania XIV the Jackyl ordered Kurrgan to attack Recon and Sniper out of the Tag Team Battle Royal and caused the stable to disband.\n\nCallis returned to television in 1998, forming a stable known as \"The Parade of Human Oddities\". The group consisted of \"freakish\" wrestlers, including \"Golga\" (a masked John Tenta a.k.a. Earthquake) and Kurrgan, and had entrance music performed by the Insane Clown Posse. The stable did not last long, and Callis eventually started managing the new tag team of Faarooq and Bradshaw, The Acolytes, until he was fired by WWF. Callis claims he was fired by Bruce Prichard for \"getting himself over at the expense of the talent\".\n\nIn mid-1999, Callis debuted in ECW as Cyrus the Virus (a name lifted from the 1997 movie \"Con Air\"), a commentator with a gimmick similar to that of his WWF persona. He would broadcast exclusively on pay-per-view along with Joey Styles. As the issues between ECW and their network TNN heightened, Cyrus was then presented as working for the network, under the shortened moniker of Cyrus. His character represented many of the real problems between ECW and TNN at that point, as he constantly criticized the violent nature of ECW programming. He would also display affection for \"RollerJam\" and \"Rockin' Bowl\", two programs on the network that ECW fans alike despised, due to the network giving them preferential treatment despite poor ratings in comparison with ECW. He singled out Joel Gertner for disciplinary measures, among other things due to Gertner \"getting himself over at the expense of the talent\", which was the dubious reason given to The Jackyl for his WWF firing.\n\nCyrus then displayed authority in ECW due to his executive position with the network, working as a heel to crusade against ECW fan favorites (in kayfabe), but to also appease the network by preventing the lewd content (as a shoot). Cyrus then teamed with the anti-hardcore Steve Corino, and eventually formed a stable with Corino, his manager Jack Victory, and their hired guns Yoshihiro Tajiri and Rhino. They were collectively known as The Network. He engaged in a long-term feud with commentator Joel Gertner, which culminated in a match on October 1, 2000, at Anarchy Rulz 2000, in which Gertner was triumphant.\n\nFollowing this, Cyrus (kayfabe) canceled ECW on TNN (as the show was soon to be canceled legitimately, in favor of WWF Raw). Cyrus would then go on to aid Rhino in winning his first ECW World Heavyweight Championship at the final pay-per-view, Guilty as Charged 2001. ECW would declare bankruptcy soon after.\n\nWith ECW gone and World Championship Wrestling purchased by the WWF, Callis returned to university, eventually earning a Master of Business Administration. He also briefly operated the No Holds Barred Wrestling Camp, a Winnipeg-based wrestling training camp. Callis also wrestled on the independent circuit, primarily appearing with Canadian promotions such as the Prairie Wrestling Association, Pro Outlaw Wrestling, and Top Rope Championship Wrestling. From 2001 to 2002, he appeared with Border City Wrestling, holding the BCW Can-Am Tag Team Championship with Terry Taylor.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, it was announced Callis will commentate the ALL IN broadcast with Ian Riccaboni, Sean Mooney, Excalibur, Alicia Atout, Justin Roberts, and Bobby Cruise \n\nIn 2003, Callis debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as a \"Management Consultant\". During this time he claimed credit for the Ultimate X match, which he said he devised to settle the dispute over who was the X Division champion once and for all. He engaged in a power struggle with then Director of Authority Erik Watts and used his power to make life difficult for Jerry Lynn, repeatedly fining and suspending him. On January 28, 2004 Callis succeeded in ousting Watts from TNA when he defeated him in a match for control of TNA, though he quietly departed the company afterward.\n\nCallis departed TNA on good terms later that year, having been offered a job in International trade that made use of his MBA. While having generally retired from professional wrestling, Callis made an appearance at the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005.\n\nCallis also wrote weekly wrestling columns for the Sun media group and co-hosted a local Winnipeg radio show called \"No Holds Barred\" with Joe Aiello on 92 CITI FM.\n\nOn October 18, 2016, Callis debuted a new podcast with longtime friend Lance Storm called \"Killing the Town with Storm and Cyrus\". The show is part of The Jericho Network on PodcastOne.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Callis announced that he had accepted a position to become the new English color commentator for New Japan Pro Wrestling's events on New Japan Pro-Wrestling World, working alongside Kevin Kelly, replacing Steve Corino.\n\nAt the December 11 World Tag League Final, Callis took part in a storyline attack done by Chris Jericho on Kenny Omega.\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Impact Wrestling announced Callis as the promotion's new executive vice president, alongside Scott D'Amore.\n\nOn April 22, 2018, Callis featured as the colour commentator for the Impact Wrestling Redemption pay-per-view as well as the following episode of Impact. During the Summer & Fall of 2018, Don Callis was regularly appearing alongside Josh Matthews as colour commentator and it now appears that Callis may have become the permanent colour commentator for Impact Wrestling following the departure of D'Angelo Dinero and the experiments in using Sonjay Dutt as a colour commentator whilst he was injured.\n\n\n"}

He died at the age of 51 in 1986.\nDuring a 92nd Street Y interview, Kotb hinted at her Muslim roots when she recounted her memories of annual summer vacations in Egypt and her veiled cousins and how her parents' migration to the United States had spared her from having to do the same:\n\nWe met our cousins who looked just like us. Some of them had the head cover on. I still remember going, 'Oh, my God. Like that could have been me.' You don't realize the gift your parents give you when you leave.\n\nKotb similarly indirectly spoke about her family's Muslim background in her autobiography when she described attempts at match-making by her relatives in Egypt:\n\nDuring my visit, I'd be sitting on the couch and there'd come a knock-knock at the door. 'Hoda, someone's at the door for yooooouuuu ... ' Oh, Lord. 'This is Mohamed. He's from Cairo. He's studying engineering ... and he has a Mercedes.' Really? He also has on a long white man dress.

{"id": "1807097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807097", "title": "Italian wine", "text": "Italian wine\n\nItalian wine is produced in every region of Italy, home to some of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, with an area of under vineyard cultivation, and contributing a 2013–2017 annual average of 48.3 million hl of wine. In 2018 Italy accounted for 19 percent of global production, ahead of France (17 percent) and Spain (15 percent). Italian wine is both exported around the world and popular domestically among Italians, who consume an average of 42 litres per capita, ranking fifth in world wine consumption.\n\nEtruscans and Greek settlers produced wine in Italy before the Romans planted their own vineyards in the 2nd century AD. The Romans greatly increased Italy's area under vine using efficient viticultural and winemaking methods, and pioneered large-scale production and storage techniques such as barrel-making and bottling.\n\nAlthough vines had been cultivated from the wild \"Vitis vinifera\" grape for millennia, it was not until the Greek colonization that wine-making flourished. Viticulture was introduced into Sicily and southern Italy by the Mycenaean Greeks, and was well established when the extensive Greek colonization transpired around 800 BC. It was during the Roman defeat of the Carthaginians (acknowledged masters of wine-making) in the 2nd century BC that Italian wine production began to further flourish. Large-scale, slave-run plantations sprang up in many coastal areas and spread to such an extent that, in AD 92, emperor Domitian was forced to destroy a great number of vineyards in order to free up fertile land for food production.\n\nDuring this time, viticulture outside of Italy was prohibited under Roman law. Exports to the provinces were reciprocated in exchange for more slaves, especially from Gaul. Trade was intense with Gaul, according to Pliny, because the inhabitants tended to drink Italian wine unmixed and without restraint. Although unpalatable to adults, it was customary, at the time, for young people to drink wine mixed with a good proportion of water.\n\nAs the laws on provincial viticulture were relaxed, vast vineyards began to flourish in the rest of Europe, especially Gaul (present day France) and Hispania. This coincided with the cultivation of new vines, such as biturica, an ancestor of the Cabernets. These vineyards became so successful that Italy ultimately became an import centre for provincial wines.\n\nDepending on the vintage, modern Italy is the world's largest or second largest wine producer. In 2005, production was about 20% of the global total, second only to France, which produced 26%. In the same year, Italy's share in dollar value of table wine imports into the U.S. was 32%, Australia's was 24%, and France's was 20%. Along with Australia, Italy's market share has rapidly increased in recent years.\n\nIn 1963, the first official Italian system of classification of wines was launched. Since then, several modifications and additions to the legislation have been made, including a major modification in 1992. The last modification, which occurred in 2010, established four basic categories which are consistent with the latest European Union wine regulations (2008–09). The categories, from the bottom to the top level, are:\n\n\nA number of sub-categories exist pertaining to the regulation of sparkling wine production (e.g. Vino Spumante, Vino Spumante di Qualità, Vino Spumante di Qualità di Tipo Aromatico, Vino Frizzante).\n\nWithin the DOP category, 'Classico' is a wine produced in the original historic centre of the protected territory. 'Superiore' is a wine with at least 0.5 more alc%/vol than its corresponding regular DOP wine and produced using a smaller allowed quantity of grapes per hectare, generally yielding a higher quality. 'Riserva' is a wine that has been aged for a minimum period of time. The length of time varies with (red, white, Traditional-method sparkling, Charmat-method sparkling). Sometimes, 'Classico' or 'Superiore' are themselves part of the name of the DOP (e.g. Chianti Classico DOCG or Soave Superiore DOCG).\n\nThe Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MIPAAF) regularly publishes updates to the official classification.\n\nIt is important to note that looser regulations do not necessarily correspond to lower quality. In fact, many IGP wines are actually high quality wines. Talented winemakers sometimes wish to create wines using varietals or varietal percentages that do not match DOC or DOCG requirements. \"Super Tuscans\", for example, are generally high quality wines that carry the IGP designation. There are several other IGP wines of superior quality, as well.\n\nUnlike France, Italy has never had an official classification of its best 'crus'. Private initiatives like the Comitato Grandi Cru d'Italia (Committee of the Grand Crus of Italy) and the Instituto del Vino Italiano di Qualità—Grandi marchi (Institute of Quality Italian Wine—Great Brands) each gather a selection of renowned top Italian wine producers, in an attempt to unofficially represent the Italian wine excellence.\n\nIn 2007 the Barbaresco Consorzio was the first to introduce the \"Menzioni Geografiche Aggiuntive\" (additional geographic mentions) also known as \"MEGA\" or \"subzones\". Sixty-five subzone vineyard areas were identified in 2007 and one additional subzone was approved in 2010, bringing the final number to 66. The main goal was to put official boundaries to some of the most storied crus in order to protect them from unjustified expansion and exploitation.\n\nThe Barolo Consorzio followed suit in 2010 with 181 MEGA, of which 170 were vineyard areas and 11 were village designations. Following the introductions of MEGA for Barbaresco and Barolo the term Vigna (Italian for vineyard) can be used on labels after its respective MEGA and only if the vineyard is within one of the approved official geographic mentions.\nThe official introduction of subzones is strongly advocated by some for different denominations, but so far Barolo and Barbaresco are the only ones to have them.\n\nImportant wine-relevant geographic characteristics of Italy include:\n\nItaly's twenty wine regions correspond to the twenty administrative regions of the country. Understanding the differences between these regions is very helpful in understanding the different types of Italian wine. Wine in Italy tends to reflect the local cuisine. Regional cuisine also influences the wine.\nThe 73 DOCG wines are located in 15 different regions but most of them are concentrated in Piedmont, Lombardia, Veneto and Tuscany. Among these are appellations appreciated and sought after by wine lovers around the world: Barolo, Barbaresco, and Brunello di Montalcino (colloquially known as the \"Killer B's\"). Other notable wines that have gained attention in recent years in the international markets and among specialists are: Amarone della Valpolicella, Prosecco di Conegliano- Valdobbiadene, Taurasi from Campania, Franciacorta sparkling wines from Lombardy; evergreen wines are Chianti and Soave, while new wines from the Centre and South of Italy are quickly gaining recognition: Verdicchio, Sagrantino, Primitivo, Nero D'Avola among others. The Friuli-Venezia Giulia is world-famous for the quality of her white wines, like Pinot Grigio. Special sweet wines like Passitos and Moscatos, made in different regions, are also famous since old time.\n\nThe regions are, roughly from Northwest to Southeast:\n\n\nItaly's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MIPAAF), has documented over 350 grapes and granted them \"authorized\" status. There are more than 500 other documented varieties in circulation, as well. The following is a list of the most common and important of Italy's many grape varieties.\n\n\nOther important whites include Carricante, Coda de Volpe, Cortese, Falanghina, Grechetto, Grillo, Inzolia, Picolit, Traminer, Verduzzo, and Vernaccia.\n\nNon-native varieties include Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer (sometimes called \"traminer aromatico\"), Petite Arvine, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, and others.\n\n\nOther major red varieties are Cannonau, Ciliegiolo, Gaglioppo, Lagrein, Lambrusco, Monica, Nerello Mascalese, Pignolo, Refosco, Schiava, Schioppettino, Teroldego, and Uva di Troia.\n\n\"International\" varieties such as Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah are also widely grown.\n\nThe term \"Super Tuscan\" (mostly used in the English-speaking world and less known in Italy) describes any wine (mostly red, but sometimes also white) produced in Tuscany that generally does not adhere to the traditional local DOC or DOCG regulations. As a result, Super Tuscans are usually \"Toscana IGT\" wines, while others are \"Bolgheri DOC\", a designation of origin rather open to international grape varieties. Traditional Tuscan DOC(G)s require that wines are made from native grapes and mostly Sangiovese. While sometimes Super Tuscans are actually produced by Sangiovese alone, they are also often obtained by (1) blending Sangiovese with international grapes (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah), (2) blending international grapes alone (especially classic Bordeaux grapes for reds; Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc for whites), or (3) using one single international variety. In a sense, red Super Tuscans anticipated the Meritage, a well-known category of international Bordeaux-style reds of US origin.\n\nAlthough an extraordinary amount of wines claim to be “the first Super Tuscan,” most would agree that this credit belongs to Sassicaia, the brainchild of marchese Mario Incisa della Rocchetta, who planted Cabernet Sauvignon at his Tenuta San Guido estate in Bolgheri back in 1944. It was for many years the marchese's personal wine, until, starting with the 1968 vintage, it was released commercially in 1971.\n\nIn 1968 Azienda Agricola San Felice produced a Super Tuscan called Vigorello, and in the 1970s Piero Antinori, whose family had been making wine for more than 600 years, also decided to make a richer wine by eliminating the white grapes from the Chianti blend, and instead adding Bordeaux varietals (namely, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot). He was inspired by Sassicaia, of which he was given the sale agency by his uncle Mario Incisa della Rocchetta. The result was one of the first Super Tuscans, which he named Tignanello, after the vineyard where the grapes were grown. What was formerly Chianti Classico Riserva Vigneto Tignanello, was pulled from the DOC in 1971, first eliminating the white grapes (then compulsory in Chianti DOC) and gradually adding French varieties. By 1975, Tignanello was made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 5% Cabernet Franc, and it remains so today. Other winemakers started experimenting with Super Tuscan blends of their own shortly thereafter.\n\nBecause these wines did not conform to strict DOC(G) classifications, they were initially labeled as vino da tavola, meaning \"table wine,\" an old official category ordinarily reserved for lower quality wines. The creation of the Indicazione Geografica Tipica category (technically indicating a level of quality between vino da tavola and DOC(G)) in 1992 and the DOC Bolgheri label in 1994 helped bring Super Tuscans \"back into the fold\" from a regulatory standpoint. Since the pioneering work of the Super Tuscans, there has been a rapid expansion in production of high-quality wines throughout Italy that do not qualify for DOC or DOCG classification, as a result of the efforts of a new generation of Italian wine producers and, in some cases, flying winemakers.\n\nMany international wine guides and wine publications rate the most popular Italian wines. Among the Italian publications, Gambero Rosso is probably the most influential. In particular, the wines that are annually given the highest rating of \"three glasses\" (\"Tre Bicchieri\") attract much attention. Recently, other guides, such as Slow Wine, published by Slow Food Italia, and Bibenda, compiled by the Fondazione Italiana Sommelier, have also gained attention both among professionals and amateurs. Slow Wine has the interesting feature of reporting on several wineries (small and medium) that genuinely represent the territory and on products that are especially interesting for their price/quality ratio (Vini Slow and Vini Quotidiani).\n\nVino cotto (literally \"cooked wine\") is a form of wine from the Marche and Abruzzo regions in Central Italy. It is typically made by individuals for their own use as it cannot legally be sold as wine. The must, from any of several local varieties of grapes, is heated in a copper vessel where it is reduced in volume by up to a third before fermenting in old wooden barrels. It can be aged for years, barrels being topped up with each harvest. It is a strong ruby-coloured wine, somewhat similar to Madeira, usually drunk with sweet puddings.\n\nVincotto, typically from Apulia, also starts as a cooked must but is not fermented, resulting in a sweet syrup suitable for the preparation of sweets and soft drinks. Once reduced and allowed to cool it is aged in storage for a few years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807103", "title": "Montmajour Abbey", "text": "Montmajour Abbey\n\nMontmajour Abbey, formally the Abbey of St. Peter in Montmajour (), was a fortified Benedictine monastery built between the 10th and 18th centuries on what was originally an island five kilometers north of Arles, in what is now the Bouches-du-Rhône Department, in the region of Provence in the south of France.\n\nThe abbey complex consists of six sections:\n\nThe abbey is noted for its 11th–14th-century graves, carved in the rock, its subterranean crypt, and its massive unfinished church. It was an important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, and in the 18th century it was the site of a large Maurist monastery, now in ruin. The abbey and the landscape around it were frequently painted and drawn by Vincent van Gogh. In 1967, production for 1968 film, \"The Lion in Winter\" featured the abbey, Katharine Hepburn's dressing room infamously accommodated in the basement. \n\nIt has been listed since 1840 as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture. Today the ruins of the abbey are cared for as a historic monument by the \"Centre des monuments nationaux\".\n\nUntil the late Middle Ages, Montmajour was an island, 43 meters above the surrounding terrain, protected by marshes and accessible only by boat. As early as the 3rd millennium BC the island was used as a cemetery, with individual graves carved into the rock. In the 9th and 10th centuries the island also served as a sanctuary for the local residents during invasions of the Saracens and the Normans. During the Middle Ages, several legends arose about Montmajour and its founding. One legend said that the island had been the sanctuary of St. Trophimus, who had been sent from Rome by St. Peter to convert the Gauls. After coming to Arles in 46 AD, he took shelter in one of the caves on the island and received disciples there. A rock cell under the church is called \"The Confessional of St. Trophimus.\" Until 943 the island belonged to the Church of St. Trophime in Arles.\n\nAnother legend said that the graves were those of soldiers of Charlemagne, who had fought against the Saracens. A third legend said that the first church was founded by King Childebert I, the son of Clovis, when he saw the fervor of a group of hermits on the island.\n\n\nSt. Peter's Chapel is the oldest existing part of the abbey, probably built between 1030 and 1050. It consists of a narthex and two parallel naves, the older one cut into the rock on the south side of the hill, and an arcade of rounded Romanesque arches resting on columns, creating openings to the rock cemetery. The columns are older than the church, and probably come from Roman buildings in Arles; but the capitals of the columns are carved with Romanesque floral designs. The southern nave is complete with a choir and a semi-circular apse.\n\nInside the church a passage leads to what appears to be a natural cave, with a small window, which according to tradition was the home of St. Trophimus and the first monks to live on the island.\n\nThe chapel was severely vandalized in 1976, with restoration due by 2012.\n\nThe rocky slope near St. Peter's Chapel has more than a dozen tombs cut into the rock in the shape of human bodies, with places for the head, shoulders and feet. The more recent tombs (14th century) were rectangular, and were probably covered with stone slabs. Most of the tombs are oriented with the feet toward the east, the direction of the sunrise and the Resurrection.\n\nThe Chapel of the Holy Cross (French: \"Chapelle de Sainte-Croix\") was built to contain the most valuable relic of the abbey, a piece of the True Cross. It is located a few hundred meters from the abbey church, outside the monastery walls, to provide the monks with greater separation from the crowds of pilgrims.\n\nIt was dedicated on 20 April and is in the shape of a cross, with a vestibule on the north side, and four semicircular apses with semicircular domes around a square bay with a cloister vault. The vault is crowned by a perfect stone square, topped by triangular pediments and a small tower. The cornices and pediments are decorated with dentils. The building, with its dignity, simplicity, symmetry and perfect craftsmanship, is considered a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture.\n\nThe crypt of St Benedict is partly dug into the rock of the hill and partly built of massive stone walls, perfectly cut. It features a transept with two absidioles, or small chapels, and a passage which leads to a small rotunda which is crowned with a cupola. The rotunda is surrounded by an ambulatory a tall, narrow hemicircular corridor with a stone barrel vault. On its outer side, the ambulatory opens into five radiating chapels, each with its own window catching the eastern light, and its own small barrel-vaulted choir bay and semi-domed apse. The large number of small chapels allowed the large number of monks in the monastery to quickly celebrate the morning mass. \nA striking feature of the crypt is the smooth quality of the stone work- the stones are perfectly cut and fitted, and their only texture is the slight rippling caused by dressing the stone with the help of a toothed hammer.\n\nThe massive church on top of the crypt has a single nave fourteen meters wide. It was designed to have five bays, but apparently because of a shortage of funds only two bays were constructed, and the west end was left unfinished.\n\nThe nave is covered with slightly pointed barrel vaults supported by projecting traverse arches resting upon cruciform piers.\n\nThe apse, at the east end of the church, is semicircular, and has the same diameter as the width of the nave. It has an imposing semi-spherical dome with five flat ribs, and three small windows, slightly offset to one side. Perhaps because of the strong mistral and tramontane winds from the north, the nave has no windows on the north side.\n\nThe church has a relatively short transept, each wing ending in a small apsidiole.\n\nThere are three doorways on the south side of the church; one leading to the rock cemetery, one to abbot's lodging (now ruined); and one to the chapter house and the spiral stairway to the bell tower.\n\nTwo new chapels were added to the north side of the nave in the 15th century. One, which served as the sacristy, contains the 18th century lavabo, or washing basin, and the other protected the charters of the Abbey.\n\nThe cloister was built to the south of the church. It was meant to reinforce the walls of the first four bays of the church, but these bays were never built. It is rectangular, 27 meters long and 24 meters wide. In the center is a cistern which collected rainwater through pipes and channels from the roofs of the monastery buildings.\n\nThe north gallery is the oldest part of the cloister. The traverse arches are supported by brackets decorated with carvings of real and mythological beasts, including a tarasque. Some of the foliage-decorated columns show human heads looking through the foliage. The original sculpted capitals were repaired in the 19th century.\n\nAt the beginning of the east gallery is the tomb of the Counts of Provence, built to hold the remains of Count Raymond Berenger IV (died 1181). The only original Romaneque capitals are in this arcade, representing the Temptation of Christ by a small devil with flaming hair; on the other side is an acrobat performing splits, and an apple, the symbol of temptation.\n\nThe west gallery was extensively altered by the Maurist monks in the 18th century, but the brackets have some of the most vivid carvings, showing the Mistral wind, the moon, the sun and fire, and a mythical amphibious beast devouring a man. It also has 13th century graffiti depicting sailing ships and horses.\n\nThe south gallery is the most recent, and the carvings are the most realistic; a donkey, a monkey, a camel and an eagle are depicted on the brackets, and the columns show the Annunciation the crowning of the Virgin, and knights fighting.\n\nThe Chapter House was connected with the east gallery- here the monks gathered each morning to hear a chapter of the Rule of St. Benedict followed by a brief teaching on it by the abbot, and also discussed the management of the abbey. It is lit by a single oculus, or round window, and connected with the nave and by a stairway to the dormitory.\n\nThe Refectory, or dining room, connected with the south gallery through a Romanesque door decorated with a grotesque head of Tantalus,\n\nThe dormitory of the monks occupied the entire floor over the refectory, and was connected to it by two staircases.\n\nThe west gallery formerly connected to the cellar, bakery, bread oven, and guest rooms, which no longer exist.\n\nThe tower was built by the abbot and cardinal, Pons de l'Orme, beginning in 1369 to protect the abbey from the rampaging Free Company (see chronology.) The tower is 26 meters high, and contained a well and a storeroom for provisions, having three stories in the upper level. The top is equipped with battlements, arrow slits and machicolation, designed to drop unpleasant things on the heads of attackers. The coat of arms of the abbot, an elm tree with two angel-monks, is carved on the outside of the tower.\n\nThe ruined Maurist Monastery was built in the classical Piranesian style on a huge scale; the building was originally five stories high, covering eight thousand square meters, with sixty windows and two grand staircases. The monks, lay brothers and novices lived on the top two floors, with their library, classrooms and archives. The building was largely demolished after the French Revolution for its building materials (see Chronology.)\n\nThe painter Vincent van Gogh, who lived in nearby Arles, frequently painted and drew the Abbey and the landscape around it. In a letter to his brother in July 1888, he said he had been at Montmajour at least fifty times \"to see the view over the plain.\" He wrote on July 5, 1888: \"Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath, where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheat fields in the valley. it was romantic, and couldn't be more so.\"\n\nA painting that van Gogh had done on July 4, 1888, \"Sunset at Montmajour\", long considered a fake, was authenticated and placed on display in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in September 2013.\n\n"}

An otherwise \"obscure tax official\", Morelly wrote two books on education and a critique of Montesquieu. As well he is thought to be (perhaps erroneously) the author of \"The Code of Nature,\" which was published anonymously in France in 1755. This book, a basis of thought for later socialist and Communist thinkers, criticized the society of his day, promoted a social order without avarice and proposed a constitution intended to lead to an egalitarian society without property, marriage, church or police.\n\nAccording to \"The Code of Nature\", \"...where no property exists, none of its pernicious consequences could exist...\" As Morelly believed that almost all social and moral ills were a consequence of private property, his proposed constitution eliminates most private property.\n\nBecause of this latter characteristic of his utopia, Morelly is often seen as a significant forerunner of later socialist and communist thinkers. François-Noël Babeuf, Charles Fourier, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Louis Blanc, Friedrich Engels, and Karl Marx all discussed Morelly's ideas in their own writing.\n\nAmong the \"sacred and fundamental laws\" Morelly proposed was \"Nothing in society will belong to anyone, either as a personal possession or as capital goods, except the things for which the person has immediate use, for either his needs, his pleasures, or his daily work.\" He was opposed to the possession of property beyond what an individual needed and, especially, to private property used to employ others.\n\nHow, then, would workers gain access to tools and equipment beyond personal possession if their job required it? According to Morelly, \"...all these durable products will be gathered together in public stores in order to be distributed to all the citizens, daily or at some other specified interval ...\"\n\nHe also proposed banning of trade between individuals: \"In accordance with the sacred laws, nothing will be sold or exchanged between citizens. Someone who needs, for example greens, vegetables or fruits, will go to the public square, which is where these items will have been brought by the man who cultivate them, and take what he needs for one day only.\"\n\nMorelly is often identified as an obscure tutor about whom almost nothing is known except that he lived in a small town in northwestern France, Vitry-le-François.\n\n\n\n"}

He now works as a coach in the Cambridge United academy, a position he took up in June 2016.\n\nChadwick began his career at Manchester United where he made 25 Premier League appearances in four seasons. While at Old Trafford he spent time out on loan at Reading and Burnley before joining West Ham United on a permanent basis in the summer of 2004. He spent a season with the Hammers before joining Stoke City on loan in August 2005 before making the move permanent in January 2006. He remained at Stoke until November 2006 making 55 appearances before joining Norwich City. Injuries restricted his time at Carrow Road and he moved to Milton Keynes Dons in October 2008. In March 2014, Chadwick joined Cambridge United, the club he supported as a child. He was released at the end of the 2014–15 season.\n\nBorn in Cambridge, Chadwick came up through the Manchester United youth system; the majority of his appearances for Manchester United at senior level were in League Cup matches or against lower profile teams in the Premier League. He scored two league goals for Manchester United, one against Bradford in January 2001 and the other against Leeds in March 2001.\n\nChadwick joined West Ham United on a free transfer at the beginning of the 2004–05 season. In his season at West Ham he scored once in the league, against Leeds.\n\nChadwick joined Stoke City on loan at the start of the 2005–06 season. He made his Stoke City debut against Sheffield Wednesday on 6 August 2005. Chadwick's impressive performances lead to a permanent deal in January 2006 with Stoke paying £100,000 for his services. Chadwick's subsequent performances earned him many fans at Stoke City. Chadwick's goal in the FA Cup Fourth Round against Walsall was voted goal of the round in 2006. The following season did not start off very well for Chadwick as in the opening match of the season against Southend United, Chadwick fainted and was taken to hospital. It was later revealed that he was only dehydrated.\n\nOn 27 June 2006, Norwich City manager Nigel Worthington confirmed that he was interested in signing Chadwick from Stoke, but Stoke City rejected Norwich's approach for the player.\n\nOn 13 November 2006, Worthington's replacement, Peter Grant, signed Chadwick, initially on loan, with a view to a permanent deal in January 2007. The proposed fee was £220,000, with an additional £100,000 if Chadwick helps the Canaries gain promotion. Chadwick immediately made an impact at Carrow Road by scoring on his debut against arch rivals Ipswich Town. He was injured in the latter stages of that game, and the injury kept him out for most of the remainder of the season. On 3 January 2007 Chadwick signed a 2 and a half-year deal for Norwich City.\n\nChadwick made his long-awaited comeback from injury as a substitute in the 1–0 win over Birmingham on 13 March 2007, and also featured in another 1–0 victory over Stoke on 17 March 2007 as he attempted to regain match fitness. His injury problems, however, continued into the following season as he struggled for fitness.\n\nOn 4 October 2008, Chadwick made his Milton Keynes Dons debut in their 4–0 defeat of Millwall after joining the League One club on an initial three-month loan from Norwich City on 1 October 2008. On 18 October 2008, Chadwick scored his first goal for the club, equalising late on to secure a 2–2 draw against Crewe Alexandra. He then scored a brace for the Dons in the 2–1 away victory over Leyton Orient. Shortly after, he picked up an injury and returned from his loan early. On Wednesday 31 December 2008, Chadwick joined the Dons on a two and a half-year deal, starting 1 January 2009. At the end of the 2009–10 season Chadwick was voted the Milton Keynes Dons Player of the Season. He won the award for the second year running at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 2 March 2013, Chadwick signed a two year extension to his MK Dons deal.\n\nOn 18 March 2014 Chadwick joined his home town club Cambridge United on loan. He made his debut the same day in a 2–1 home win against Welling United. Chadwick signed permanently for Cambridge on 7 June 2014. At the end of the 2014–15 season the club did not offer him a new deal when his contract expired.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge United, Chadwick signed for Isthmian League Division One North side Soham Town Rangers in November 2015. He spent one season at Soham before returning to Cambridge as a full-time coach in the club's academy.\n\nChadwick made his debut for the England under-21s in the win against Luxembourg in September 1999. He played the full 90 minutes as England won 5−0 in the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifier at the Madejski Stadium. England qualified for the finals in Slovakia and Chadwick made substitute appearances against Italy and Slovakia as they were eliminated at the group stages. He featured four times during England's qualifying campaign for 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship with his last appearance coming in the 5−0 win against Albania on 4 September 2001. Overall, Chadwick made 13 appearances for the U21s but scored no goals.\n\nIn May 2020, Chadwick spoke about how his mental health had been affected by abuse about his appearance he had received as a young player. He highlighted how the media had made fun of his appearance, \"spots on my face, teeth sticking out, that sort of thing\", making particular mention of the abuse he had received on the BBC TV programme, They Think It's All Over. He received an apology from the show's former host Nick Hancock.\n\nManchester United\n\nCambridge United\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

A pioneer in the field of lesbian and gay studies, she is widely published.\n\nJay was born Karla Jayne Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, to Rhoda and Abraham Berlin, who worked for a dunnage company on the Red Hook (Brooklyn) docks. Raised in a non-observant, largely secular Jewish home, she attended the Berkeley Institute, a private girls' school in Brooklyn. In 1964 she enrolled at Barnard College, where she majored in French and graduated in 1968 after having taken part in the student demonstrations at Columbia University.\n\nWhile she shared many of the goals of the radical left-wing of the late 1960s, Jay was at odds with the male-supremacist behavior of many of the movement’s leaders. In 1969, she became a member of Redstockings. \nJay, who had been aware of her lesbianism since high school, came out to her consciousness-raising group in Redstockings. At around the same time she began using the name Karla Jay to reflect her feminist principles.\n\nWhen activists founded the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) in the wake of the Stonewall Riots of June 1969, Jay, openly lesbian, became an early member and an active participant. She balanced attendance at GLF meetings with graduate school at New York University, where she majored in comparative literature. She was one of the few women actively involved in the early gay rights movement on both coasts. \n\nJay, along with Lee Mason and other LGBT+ artists and activists helped create the Gay-In III festival in Griffith Park, Los Angeles in September of 1970. This festival was intended to be, in the words of Karla Jay herself, one of “these queer ‘love fests’... and [they] included kissing booths, face painting, marijuana, vodka-spiked oranges, guerilla theatre, fake marriages, voter registration and advice regarding arrests.” In reality, the festival was poorly attended but continued the precedent of such festivals, such as the ubiquitous gay pride parades. Jay reflects on the intentions behind the gay-in as an essential part of more serious aspects of the gay rights movement: “If we dared to hold hands and party in public, we knew unimaginable rights might follow. And they did.”\n\nJay was a member of Lavender Menace, a group that formed to protest the exclusion of lesbians from mainstream Women's Liberation. She was involved in the planning and execution of the \"Lavender Menace Zap\" at the Second Congress to Unite Women in New York City in May 1970. This zap is considered a turning-point in the history of second-wave feminism.\n\nAlso in 1970, the \"Wall Street Ogle-In\" took place. Led by Jay, women marched on Wall Street with signs addressing street harassment. As a role reversal, the women catcalled the men they passed in hopes of raising awareness of the unpleasant nature of the street harassment women experience daily.\n\nWorking with Allen Young Jay edited \"Out of the Closets\" (1972), a pioneering anthology \nthat gave voice to the Radicalesbians, Martha Shelley, and writers such as Rita Mae Brown. It was during the 1970s that Jay first heard about the writers Natalie Clifford Barney and Renée Vivien, lesbian members of the American expatriate community in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. Their lives and works became the subject of Jay's doctoral dissertation, published by Indiana University Press as \"The Amazon and the Page\" (1988).\n\nJay contributed the essay \"Confessions of a Worrywart: Ruminations on a Lesbian Feminist Overview\" to the anthology \"\" (2003), edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nAt the presentation of Pace University's 10th Annual Dyson Distinguished Achievement Awards on April 6, 2006, Jay was honored with the Distinguished Faculty Award. She received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle in 2006.\n\nJay is featured in the feminist history film \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\".\n\nHer papers are held in the Archives & Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library.\n\n\n\n"}

A traditional royalist who was fond of the Monarchy of Spain and the Spanish Empire, he ruled as a governor-general, but effectively as an authoritarian dictator.\n\nBorn into a noble and affluent Spanish cattle ranching family in Hincha (today \"Hinche\" in Haiti), Santana was a lifelong supporter of the Dominican revolt against the Haitian hegemony and a noted general during the Dominican War of Independence (1844–1856). Unlike many of his political opponents who wanted to ultimately establish an independent Dominican state, Santana sought to reintegrate Hispanola into the Spanish Empire. He oversaw the reestablishment of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo as well as exile and imprisonment of a number of noted separatist and nationalist dissidents who had previously been his comrades during the war of independence. Under mounting pressure from the opposition which had been organizing a coup d'etat, he was forced to resign from his position. He died during the Dominican Restoration War, after which the country regained its independence.\n\nHis parents were Pedro Santana, an indigenous Mexican man, and Petronila Familias, a Canarian woman, both landowners in the border zone between Santo Domingo and Saint Domingue; this meant that Santana was a Mestizo. Around 1805, Santana moved with his family to the Cibao valley for a short time, specifically in Gurabo, and later permanently to El Seibo at the eastern part of the colony, where he eventually became a cattle rancher for two years.\n\nSantana was the Dominican Republic's president (although he ruled as a dictator) during the years 1844–48, 1853–56, and 1858–61 (when Spain annexed the Dominican Republic as Santana wished). Thereafter, Santana became governor, with the rank of Captain General of the territory. He held those titles until 1862.\n\nSantana had great talent as a military leader, but was unable to leave his dictatorial personality on the battlefield. Though many historians criticise his rule as an economic disaster, Santana was meticulous in conducting public affairs, and obviously a great soldier.\n\nSantana also fought with distinction in the Revolution of July 7, 1857, when Cibao placed their revolutionary army under his command. The Congress of the Dominican Republic awarded Santana the title of “Liberator of the Nation” on July 18, 1849 for his victory in the Battle of Las Carreras.\n\nHe is considered a brilliant military strategist, and was a key figure in the successful separation of the Dominican Republic from Haiti. But many historians, such as Nancie L. González and Howard J. Wiarda, think that some of his later actions barred him from becoming a genuine national hero.\n\n\nSantana had two brothers, Ramón (b. 15 June 1801) —his twin brother— and Florencio (b. 14 November 1805) —who was paralytic, mute and mentally ill.\n\nPedro Santana was engaged to María del Carmen Ruiz, a beautiful damsel who, when returning to her home in El Seybo from a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Our Lady of Altagracia in Higüey, got her horse frightened with Ruiz flying and crashing against a rock, dying instantly. The death of his fiancée caused Santana a deep depression. His twin brother Ramón convinced Pedro to accompany him to visit his fiancée Froilana Febles, who lived in the town of El Seybo. In his visits to his to-be sister-in-law, Pedro fell in love with his brother's to-be mother-in-law, Micaela Antonia del Rivero, the rich widow of Miguel Febles, who was much older than Pedro. This meant that Froilana Febles became Pedro Santana's sister-in-law and stepdaughter at the same time, while Micaela del Rivero became sister-in-law and mother-in-law of Ramón Santana. The Santana-del Rivero marriage was very unhappy, but it gave Pedro Santana influence and power in the Southeastern region.\n\nHe enwidowed and remarried, this time with Ana Zorrilla, who was also a widow and a bit older than him. Because of his marriages with mature women, he had no legitimate children.\n\nHis brother Ramón died on 15 June 1844 during the Revolutionary war of Independence.\n\nFrom his brother's marriage to Froilana Febles, he had 3 nephews: Manuel (b. 24 March 1833), Francisco, and Rafael Santana (b. 1834-5), whom inherited many of Santana's properties. From Rafael Santana and his wife Paula Bobadilla is descended \"Cardinal\" Octavio Beras and comedian Freddy Beras-Goico.\n\nPedro Santana died in the city of Santo Domingo on June 14, 1864, shortly after having been bestowed the hereditary title of \"Marqués de las Carreras\" (28 March 1862), in recognition of his victory in the Battle of Las Carreras, by Queen Isabella II of Spain, and was buried in the Ozama Fortress next to the Torre del Homenaje. From 1978 his remains lie at the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic.\n\nSantana died childless. He bequeathed his properties to his nephews, his godchildren, and his stepchildren. He included a pension to his disabled brother Florencio and his aunt Dominga Familia.\n\n"}

He was born in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He was a cousin of Nobel laureate Wilhelm Wien. \n\nWien studied in Konigsberg, Freiburg, and Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and August Kundt, receiving his PhD under Helmholtz in 1888. In 1892 he worked with Wilhelm Röntgen in Würzburg, where in 1893 he received the \"habilitation\", qualifying him to be a professor. He moved to the Technical High School of Aachen in 1898 where he became Extraordinary Professor in 1899. In 1904 he became full Professor at the Technical High School of Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). From 1911 to 1935 he was Professor at University of Jena, in Jena, Germany, where he died in 1938. \n\nWien's scientific research were in the areas of high frequency electronics, acoustics, and electrolyte conductance. He is known for the invention of the Wien bridge in 1891, a type of AC measurement circuit similar to the Wheatstone bridge which was used to measure the impedance of capacitors and inductors. From 1906 to 1909 he did research into the efficiency of early radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, which used an electric spark to generate radio waves. In existing transmitters the spark damped the oscillation in the tuned circuit, creating highly damped waves, in which the radio energy was spread over a wide bandwidth, limiting their range. In 1906 Wien invented a new type of spark gap, called a \"quenched gap\", that extinguished the spark immediately after energy had been transferred to the tuned circuit. This transmitter produced very lightly damped waves, which had a narrower bandwidth and thus greater range, and also produced an easy to identify musical tone in the receiver headphones. Wien \"singing spark\" or quenched-spark transmitters (\"Löschfunkensender\") were widely used until the end of the spark era around 1920. At Jena he studied the conductance of electrolyte solutions when high fields and high frequencies, discovering what is now called Wien's law. \n\nThe Wien bridge oscillator is so named because it uses a Wien bridge as a feedback network, but it was not invented by Wien. William Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, was the first to use a Wien bridge as a feedback network around a vacuum tube amplifier to create an oscillator in 1939.\n\n"}

{"id": "1807164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807164", "title": "Dryosaurus", "text": "Dryosaurus\n\nDryosaurus ( ; meaning 'tree lizard', Greek \"δρῦς\" () meaning 'tree, oak' and \"σαυρος\" () meaning 'lizard'; the name reflects the forested habitat, not a vague oak-leaf shape of its cheek teeth as is sometimes assumed) is a genus of an ornithopod dinosaur that lived in the Late Jurassic period. It was an iguanodont (formerly classified as a hypsilophodont). Fossils have been found in the western United States and were first discovered in the late 19th century. \"Valdosaurus canaliculatus\" and \"Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki\" were both formerly considered to represent species of \"Dryosaurus\".\n\nBased on known specimens, they had been estimated to have reached at least long, and to have weighed up to . However, as no known adult specimens of the genus have been found, the adult size remains unknown. In 2018, when the largest specimen (CM 1949) was concluded to be from another species. Revising the identity of this specimen put the previous research on size and growth into question.\n\n\"Dryosaurus\" had a long neck, long, slender legs and a long, stiff tail. Their arms, however, with five fingers on each hand, were short. They had a horny beak and cheek teeth. Some scientists suggest that it had cheek-like structures to prevent the loss of food while the animal processed it in the mouth. The teeth of \"Dryosaurus\" were characterized by a strong median ridge on the lateral surface.\n\nIn 1876, Samuel Wendell Williston in Albany County, Wyoming discovered the remains of small euornithopods. In 1878, Professor Othniel Charles Marsh named these as a new species of \"Laosaurus\", \"Laosaurus altus\". The specific name \"altus\", meaning \"tall\" in Latin, refers to it being larger than \"Laosaurus celer\". In 1894, Marsh made the taxon a separate genus, \"Dryosaurus\". The generic name is derived from the Greek δρῦς, \"drys\", \"tree, oak\", referring to a presumed forest-dwelling life mode. Later it was often assumed to have been named after an oak-leaf shape of its cheek teeth, which, however, is absent. The type species remains \"Laosaurus altus\", the \"combinatio nova\" is \"Dryosaurus altus\".\n\nThe holotype, YPM 1876, was found in a layer of the Upper Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, dating from the Tithonian. It consists of a partial skeleton including a rather complete skull and lower jaws. Several other fossils from Wyoming have been referred to \"Dryosaurus altus\". They include specimens YPM 1884: the rear half of a skeleton; AMNH 834: a partial skeleton lacking the skull from the \"Bone Cabin Quarry\"; and CM 1949: a rear half of a skeleton dug up in 1905 by William H. Utterback. From 1922 onwards in Utah, Earl Douglass discovered \"Dryosaurus\" remains at the \"Dinosaur National Monument\". These include CM 11340: the front half of a skeleton of a very young individual; CM 3392: a skeleton with skull but lacking the tail; CM 11337: a fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile; and DNM 1016: a left ilium dug up by technician Jim Adams. Other fossils were found in Colorado. In Lily Park, Moffat County, James Leroy Kay and Albert C. Lloyd in 1955 recovered CM 21786, a skeleton lacking skull and neck. From 'Scheetz’ Quarry 1, at Uravan, Montrose County, in 1973 Peter Malcolm Galton and James Alvin Jensen described specimen BYU ESM-171R found by Rodney Dwayne Scheetz and consisting of some vertebrae, a left lower jaw, a left forelimb and two hindlimbs. \nRodney D. Scheetz and his family discovered a fossil locality around five miles from Uravan, Colorado in the spring of 1972. This site, unintentionally exposed by a bulldozer, was found to contain fossil fragments, said to be in such condition they looked like unfossilized bone. The site was noted in a 1973 paper, and Scheetz continued to dig at the site annually until publishing a short note in 1991. By then around 2500 fragments had been excavated, almost all of which specimens are thought to have belonged to \"Dryosaurus\". At least eight individuals are represented, with ages ranging from juvenile to embryonic; finding specimens of embryonic age is exceptionally rare for dinosaur fossils. Eggshells were also represented in the sample. Scheetz voiced his intention to continue work at the site following the publishing of the note.\n\nGregory S. Paul in his 2010 field guide to dinosaurs (2nd edition published in 2016) suggested that the Utah material represented a separate species, which was confirmed by Carpenter and Galton (2018), who described the Dinosaur National Monument \"Dryosaurus\" as a new species, \"D. elderae\".\n\n\"Dryosaurus\" subsisted primarily on low growing vegetation in ancient floodplains. A quick and agile runner with strong legs, \"Dryosaurus\" used its stiff tail as a counterbalance. It probably relied on its speed as a main defense against carnivorous dinosaurs.\n\nA \"Dryosaurus\" hatchling found at Dinosaur National Monument in Utah confirmed that \"Dryosaurus\" followed similar patterns of craniofacial development to other vertebrates; the eyes were proportionally large while young and the muzzle proportionally short. As the animal grew, its eyes became proportionally smaller and its snout proportionally longer.\n\nThe \"Dryosaurus\" holotype specimen YPM 1876 was discovered in Reed's YPM Quarry 5, in the Upper Brushy Basin Member, of the Morrison Formation. In the Late Jurassic Morrison formation of Western North America, \"Dryosaurus\" remains have been recovered from stratigraphic zones 2-6. This formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. In 1877 this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.\n\nThe Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as \"Camarasaurus\", \"Barosaurus\", \"Diplodocus\", \"Apatosaurus\" and \"Brachiosaurus\". Dinosaurs that lived alongside \"Dryosaurus\" included the herbivorous ornithischians \"Camptosaurus\", \"Stegosaurus \"and \"Nanosaurus\". Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods \"Saurophaganax\", \"Torvosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\", \"Marshosaurus\", \"Stokesosaurus\", and \"Ornitholestes\" and \"Allosaurus\", which accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Early mammals were present in this region, such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the \"Araucaria\"-like conifer \"Brachyphyllum\".\n\nOther sites that have produced \"Dryosaurus\" material include Bone Cabin Quarry, the Red Fork of the Powder River in Wyoming and Lily Park in Colorado.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of William Thomas Greenwell (1777–1856) and Dorothy Smales. He had three brothers Francis, Alan, and Henry Nicholas Greenwell, and a sister Dorothy (1821–1882) who published poetry under the name Dora Greenwell.\n\nAfter an early education by Rev George Newby, he attended Durham School. One of his schoolmates was Henry Baker Tristram. He matriculated at University College, Durham in October 1836 and graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in June 1839. He started training to be a barrister at Middle Temple, but owing to ill health decided to leave London and return to University College in 1841, completing a licentiate in Theology in 1842. He received a Master of Arts in 1843. Greenwell was ordained a deacon by Bishop Edward Maltby 30 June 1844 and priest 28 June 1846. He was bursar of University College in Durham from 1844 to 1847.\n\nHis family estate included the site of the ancient Roman fort Longovicium. As a child he and his brother Frank would scoop out soil covering the camp, leading to his interest in archaeology. He was a founding member of the Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club in 1846, and later that year toured Germany and Italy. In August 1852 he presented a paper at an Archaeological Institute there. In March 1864 he excavated fourteen barrows at Danes Graves a site of the Arras Culture of the British Iron Age and was subsequently criticised by William Harrison-Broadley for his poor excavation technique. Greenwell undertook a large-scale excavation of 53 barrows at Danes Graves with John Robert Mortimer between 1897–98. Greenwell is also noted for his work on the Grimes Graves along with his treatises on electrum coinage of Cyzicus, and cataloguing of the Late Bronze Age finds from Heathery Burn Cave.\n\nGreenwell's enormous collection of antiquities, many of which date from the Neolithic or Bronze Age period in Britain, is now in the British Museum. This was thanks to the generosity of J. P. Morgan, who bought them for £10,000. In 1895 he sold his collections of flint implements to Dr W. Allan Sturge, formerly of Nice. His earliest collection of note was Greek coins, which he eventually sold to a Mr. Warren of Boston, Massachusetts, with Warren later donating it to the Boston Museum. One of his students was Augustus Pitt Rivers. With the money made from selling his collections he was able to repurchase his ancestral home, Greenwell Ford, which was then inherited by his nephew after his death.\n\nGreenwell held the perpetual curacy of Ovingham with Mickley from 1847 to 1850. He then briefly served Robert Isaac Wilberforce as curate at Burton Agnes, Yorkshire, before becoming assistant to William George Henderson, principal of Hatfield Hall, Durham. In 1852 he was appointed principal of Neville Hall, a hostel for students at Newcastle College of Medicine, with whom he worked among the town's cholera victims in 1853.\n\nGreenwell was appointed canon at Durham Cathedral from 1854 to his death, and became known as Canon Greenwell. He was also chaplain and censor at Bishop Cosin's Hall from 1855-1863. From 1863 to 1908 Greenwell was librarian of Durham Cathedral, where he continued the work of cataloguing the holdings begun by Joseph Stevenson. Greenwell was president of the Architectural and Archaeological Society of Durham from 1865 to his death, and vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle from 1890 until his death. In 1868 he was elected to the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1870, later chairing the Durham ward petty sessions, and was elected an alderman in 1904.\n\nHe was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1898. He died, unmarried, at North Bailey, Durham, on 27 January 1918, and was buried at Lanchester.\n\nKnown in Durham as 'The Canon', he had a reputation for being bluff and plain-spoken. Greenwell was a Liberal in politics, and in religion a Tractarian who in later life retreated to more conservative high-churchmanship. His fishing and hunting skills developed in early childhood on the River Browney and he remained a keen angler to his ninety-eighth year. As an outdoorsman keen on angling and shooting, his sporting instincts made him naturally sympathetic to poachers. When a poacher was brought for trial in Durham both the police and the defendant, with differing motives, would inquire whether Greenwell would be on the bench. He is known as originator of \"Greenwell's Glory\", used in fly fishing.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He travelled to the Canary Islands, where he met a woman who was half-Spanish and half-English, and they subsequently married, resulting in Hawkes' birth. Being schooled in London, Hawkes inherited his father's fascination with past societies, influenced in this by the scenery of southern England and what he had read in the works of Rudyard Kipling. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Hawkes' father volunteered to join several friends in the Special Reserve of the Northumberland Fusiliers; he brought his family to Northumberland with him, where Christopher encountered archaeological and historical monuments in the North-East, such as Hadrian's Wall and Durham Cathedral.\n\nAccording to Brian Fagan, Hawkes was \"a complex character\" and \"an ardent and extremely skilled typologist\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1807200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807200", "title": "Enthronement", "text": "Enthronement\n\nAn enthronement is a ceremony of inauguration, involving a person—usually a monarch or religious leader—being formally seated for the first time upon their throne. Enthronements may also feature as part of a larger coronation rite. \n\nIn a general sense, an \"enthronement\" may also refer to a ceremony marking a monarch's accession, generally distinguished from a coronation as no crown or other regalia is physically bestowed upon the one being enthroned, although regalia may be present at the ceremony. \n\nEnthronements occur in both church and state settings, since the throne is seen as a symbol of authority, both secular and spiritual.\n\nEnthronements are most popular in religious settings, as a chair is seen as the symbol of the authority to teach. Thus in Christianity, bishops of almost all denominations have a ceremony of enthronement after they assume office or by which they assume office. Eastern Orthodox Churches and Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as Anglican Church often have elaborate ceremonies marking the inauguration of their episcopates.\n\nHowever, in the Roman Catholic Church the rite of enthronement is limited to Eastern Catholic Churches. In these, enthronement is the rite by which a new bishop assumes authority over his eparchy and before which he is forbidden to intervene in its governance in any way, whether personally or by proxy. The overwhelmingly majority Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church has no ceremony of enthronement, although when a bishop is ordained in a church of the diocese he is to head, the principal consecrator invites him, after his investiture with mitre and crozier, to be seated on the cathedra of the church; if the ordination takes place elsewhere, the principal consecrator invites him merely to take first place among the concelebrating bishops. Instead of by enthronement, a Latin-Rite bishop takes office through an officially recorded presentation of the papal bull of his appointment, a ceremony that does not necessarily involve his personal presence. In the section in the Caeremoniale Episcoporum on \"The Reception of a Bishop in His Cathedral Church\" there is no mention of a ritual taking possession of the episcopal \"cathedra\". The same is true even of older editions of this work.\n\nPopes were traditionally enthroned and crowned with the papal tiara in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. However, during the Avignon papacy the papacy could not make use of its \"cathedra\", as the Pope was in France while the cathedral was in Rome. Thus the coronations continued, while enthronements could not take place until the Pontiffs' return to Rome. Upon the return of Pope Gregory XI to Rome, the Lateran Palace was badly in need of repair, so the Pope made the Vatican his residence and transferred coronations to Saint Peter's Basilica. However, the Lateran Basilica is the cathedral of Rome, so enthronements continued there, with brief interruptions (see prisoner in the Vatican). \n\nToday, \"a solemn ceremony of the inauguration of the pontificate\" is held after the election of a pope and only later, \"within an appropriate time\", the new pope \"take(s) possession of the Patriarchal Archbasilica of the Lateran, according to the prescribed ritual\", which includes taking his seat upon the episcopal \"cathedra\" and which can therefore be considered a form of enthronement.\n\nPreviously, most inaugural ceremonies marking the accession of a monarch took the form of a coronation rite, wherein the ruler was consecrated, physically crowned, and invested with other items of regalia.\n\nNow that coronations are no longer being practiced in most monarchies (most nations require only that their monarchs take an oath upon accession), the term \"enthronement\" may be used by some to describe ceremonies surrounding the monarch's accession, including his or her oath-taking, since the \"throne\" (physical or symbolic) of the monarch remains. \n\nWhile no Norwegian monarch has been crowned in nearly a century, Olav V instituted a \"consecration\" ceremony, wherein he received the church's blessing, to inaugurate his reign. This practice was also followed by his son Harald V. The formal inauguration ceremony of monarchs of Japan, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands take on many different forms and are also known as \"enthronements\" in a broader sense. However, the term \"coronation\" is still sometimes used to describe these ceremonies, even though they are not coronations in the truest sense of the word.\n\nBelgium has no physical crown (except as a heraldic emblem); the formal installation of a Belgian monarch requires only a solemn oath be taken on the constitution in the parliament, symbolic of the limited power allowed to the king under the 1831 Constitution. During the enthronement of King Albert II, a member of the Chamber of Representatives, Jean-Pierre Van Rossem, shouted out \"Long live the Republic of Europe!\", only to be shouted down by the others, who cried \"\"Vive le Roi!\"\". A similar protest had occurred during the 1950 enthronement of King Baudouin.\n\nThe Emperor of Japan attends an enthronement ceremony soon after his accession; the last such ritual was held in 2019 for Emperor Naruhito. The Imperial Regalia consist of a sword, known as \"Kusanagi\", a jewel, known as \"Yasakani no magatama\", and a mirror, called \"Yata no Kagami\". Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler.\n\nThis ancient rite was held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan, until 1990 when the enthronement ceremony for Emperor Akihito took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The ceremony is not public, and the regalia are generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few Shinto priests. However, an account in \"Time\" from the enthronement of Akihito's father Hirohito in 1928 reveals a few details. First is a three-hour ceremony in which the emperor ritually informed his ancestors that he had assumed the throne. This was followed by the enthronement itself, which took place in an enclosure called the \"Takamikura\", which contained a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. This was surrounded by an octagonal pavilion with curtains, surmounted by a great golden phoenix.\n\nThe new emperor proceeded to the chair, where after being seated, the \"Kusanagi\" and \"Yasakani no magatama\" were placed on stands next to him. A simple \"shaku\" (a flat wooden baton or sceptre) was presented to the monarch, who faced his Prime Minister standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. The emperor offered an address announcing his accession to the throne, calling upon his subjects to single-mindedly assist him in attaining all of his aspirations. The Prime Minister replied with an address promising fidelity and devotion, followed by three shouts of \"\"Banzai\"\" from all of those present. The timing of this last event was synchronized, so that Japanese around the world could join in the \"Banzai\" shout at precisely the moment that it was being offered in Kyoto. In 1990 after the shouts of Banzai, a 21 gun salute fired out from the grounds of the palace a short distance away.\n\nAfter this ceremony, the new Emperor gave offerings to Amaterasu, offering rice specially prepared for the occasion. This was followed by three banquets and a visit to the Shrines of his ancestors.\n\nThe Grand Duke of Luxembourg is enthroned at a ceremony held in the nation's parliament at the beginning of his or her reign. The monarch takes an oath of loyalty to the state constitution, then attends a solemn mass at the Notre-Dame Cathedral. No crown or other regalia exists for the rulers of Europe's last sovereign Grand Duchy.\n\nThe new ruler of Malaysia is enthroned in a special ceremony after his election, which involves the use of several items of regalia including the \"Tengkolok Diraja\", or Royal Headdress. According to legend, the first Sultan of Perak forswore the wearing of any diadems after the miraculous refloating of his ship, which had run aground during his journey to establish his reign in Perak. Hence, while Malaysian coronations are rather elaborate affairs, they do not involve the imposition of a crown.\n\nThe new king proceeds into the Istana Negara Throne Hall at the head of a large procession also consisting of his spouse, specially-picked soldiers carrying the royal regalia, and other notables including the Grand Chamberlain, or \"Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela\". The king and his wife are seated upon their thrones, and the regalia are brought forward. Following this, the \"Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela\" brings forward a copy of the Quran, which the new monarch reverently receives, kisses, and places on a special table located between his throne and the queen's. A formal proclamation of the new king's reign is read, followed by the taking of a special coronation oath. The Prime Minister gives a special speech, which is followed by an address by the new king from the throne. A prayer is said, the Quran is returned to the Chamberlain, and the ceremony is completed.\n\nNo monarch of Spain has been physically crowned since John I of Castile and Ferdinand I of Aragon. Instead, the new monarch appears at the Cortes, where he or she takes a formal oath to uphold the Constitution. Although the crown is visibly present at the ceremony, it is never actually placed on the monarch's head. Five days after his visit to the Cortes, Spanish King Juan Carlos I attended an \"Enthronement Mass\" at the Church of San Jerónimo el Real in Madrid. Accompanied by his wife Sofia, he was escorted beneath a canopy to a set of thrones set up near the high altar. Following the service, the King and queen returned to the palace, where they greeted the people from the balcony, reviewed troops, and attended a formal banquet.\n\nHistorically Castilian coronations were performed at Toledo, or in the Church of St Jerome at Madrid, with the king being anointed by the archbishop of Toledo. The monarch assumed the royal sword, sceptre, crown of gold and the apple of gold, after receiving his anointing. Aragonese coronations were performed at Zaragoza by the Archbishop of Tarragona.\n\nIn Sweden, no monarch has been crowned since Oscar II in 1873. King Carl XVI Gustaf, was enthroned in a simple ceremony at the throne room of the Royal Palace in Stockholm on 19 September 1973. The regalia were displayed on cushions to the right and left of the royal Silver Throne, but were never held by the King, who made an accession speech, which comprised the main purpose of the undertaking.\n\n\n"}

Today the church offers services in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. The growing Chinese-Canadian Baptist community has also led to the East Toronto, North Toronto, Mississauga and Scarborough Chinese Baptist Churches being established in Toronto's suburbs as well as the Windsor Chinese Baptist Church. Many of these daughter churches have in turn established daughter churches of their own further into the suburbs.\n\nToronto Chinese Baptist Church is a member of the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec.\n\n\n"}

In 1086, the manor, simply called Herste, was in the ancient hundred of Foxearle.\n\nIn 1677, Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex was paid £3 when he went to a cricket match played at \"ye Dicker\", a common near Herstmonceux, one of the earliest references to the sport.\n\nThe parish council consists of eleven elected members. An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward had a population at the 2011 census of 2,852.\n\nThe village (previously called Gardner Street) is part of the larger Herstmonceux civil parish, which includes Cowbeech and the hamlets of Foul Mile, Trolliloes, Cowbeech Hill, Stunts Green, Ginger's Green, Flowers Green and part of Windmill Hill. Cowbeech village is north-west of the parish. Eastbourne is 7 miles south-west of the village, and Brighton and Hove 21 miles west-south-west.\n\nHerstmonceux Castle south-east of the village is a former site of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. It is now home to the Bader International Study Centre of Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, and the area therefore enjoys an influx of Canadian and other international students each school year. The castle grounds are also home to the Observatory Science Centre, which is operated by Science Projects Limited, and the Herstmonceux Mediaeval Festival. Buckwell Place was the seat of the Hare family.\n\nThere are two Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish. Herstmonceux Park is of importance because of its wetland habitat and fen vegetation. It is the only known location of Milk Parsley \"(Peucedanum palustre)\" in the south-east. The second site, Pevensey Levels, lies partially in the parish. The site is of biological interest consisting of low-lying grazing meadows, hosting a wide variety of wetland flora and fauna.\n\nEducation is provided at Herstmonceux CE Primary School.\n\nAll Saints (Church of England) parish church, with its 12th century west tower and 13th/14th century nave, overlooks the Castle. Herstmonceux Congregational Church, just outside the village on the way to the castle, was erected in 1811 and is now a listed building.\n\nThe Herstmonceux area is famous for the making of trugs – baskets made from split willow boards set in an ash or chestnut frame. A number of local people continue this tradition. There are also a number of local B&Bs which provide lodgings for tourists staying in the area due to its rural nature but close proximity to London, Brighton and other coastal towns and cities.\n\nThe Herstmonceux Medieval Festival is held annually in August.\n\nThe village is twinned with Varengeville-sur-Mer, in Normandy, France.\n\n"}

Obote was still party leader when he died in October 2005, although he had previously announced his intention to step down.\n\nThe party won nine out of 289 elected seats in the 2006 general election. In the presidential election of the same date, UPC candidate Miria Obote won 0.8 percent of the vote.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, the party elected Olara Otunnu, a former United Nations undersecretary-general for children and armed conflict, to lead the party. He replaced Obote's widow Miria.\n\nThe UPC dominated Ugandan politics from independence until 1971, when Milton Obote was overthrown by Idi Amin. The party returned to power under Obote in 1980 until he was overthrown again in 1985 by Tito Okello. The history of the UPC is intertwined with the ethnic divide that has plagued Uganda since it was a British protectorate.\n\nAs independence approached in the 1940s-1950s, it was clear that the Baganda (the largest ethnic group) wanted extensive autonomy in Uganda, and the Buganda King's party Kabaka Yekka (\"The King Only\") emphasised this desire. However, this was not favoured by most Ugandans of other tribes and amongst some Buganda educated elite who formed an alternative party, the Democratic Party, to aspire for national unity. Although unpopular in Buganda, the Democratic Party had widespread support in the rest of the Bantu-speaking South.\n\nInto this void, there emerged an alternative - the Uganda National Congress (UNC). Although led by a northerner (Milton Obote), the UNC appeared more modernist and accommodating and attracted many southerners particularly in the east. The UNC formed a number of alliances with other parties and emerged as the UPC. The three parties (Kabaka Yekka, UPC, and the Democratic Party) contested the first pre-independence election.\n\nAs expected, Kabaka Yekka won most of the seats in Buganda and the UPC won most seats in the north and east. However the Democratic Party (DP) led by Benedicto Kiwanuka emerged as the largest single party. Kiwanuka was on the verge of becoming the first prime minister of independent Uganda when he was thwarted by a surprising alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka.\n\nThe Kabaka was afraid that DP would remove the monarchy in favour of a more modern-looking Uganda. As for the UPC, Milton Obote, realising he had lost the election, saw the alliance as the way to power. In return, Obote offered the Kabaka a ceremonial role in the new administration and the retention of all royal powers. The UPC/KY alliance thus formed Uganda's first government with Milton Obote as prime minister.\n\nThe alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka did not last long. After four years in power, Milton Obote ordered a military attack on the Kabaka's palace in 1966. John Mikloth Magoola Luwuliza-Kirunda came in as organizing secretary in 1966. The attack was led by an army officer called Idi Amin. The Kabaka escaped to London and Obote declared himself President of Uganda. This action more than anything else began the decline of the UPC as a popular party in Uganda. As his unpopularity grew Obote increasingly turned to his Northern home support rather than trying to strengthen the party in the South. The 1969 elections were cancelled and Obote became dictatorial. His government was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin.\n\nThe UPC returned in 1979 after Idi Amin was overthrown. Obote as leader of the UPC was closely aligned to the Military Junta that had replaced Idi Amin and rather than strengthen the support of the party in the South of Uganda took up a more military approach. The army (traditionally dominated by Northerners) was a brutal machine that carried out numerous atrocities particularly in the South. This polarised the North/South divide with the UPC being perceived more as a Northern party than ever before. Southerners turned to the Democratic Party and a smaller party called the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM) led by a former UPC member, Yoweri Museveni.\n\nIn the elections of 1980, there was overwhelming suspicion that the UPC had rigged the result with the help of the Military Junta. This perception was further enhanced when Obote appointed the head of the Military Junta, Paulo Muwanga as his Vice President when the UPC was declared the winner of the elections. A civil war broke out in Uganda when Yoweri Museveni rejected the result and went to the bush to fight the government.\n\nYoweri Museveni's eventual success was due to the North/South divide that the UPC had helped foster in Uganda. Southerners more than ever before realised that they had to take up arms to protect their rights. In the past most Southerners had despised military careers. When Museveni came to power in 1986, his army was dominated by Southerners particularly from the west.\n\nOn November 28, 2005, Obote's widow Miria was elected party president. Miria Obote was UPC's presidential candidate in the 2006 general election.\n\nThe UPC returned to contest the election in 2006, when Museveni restored multi-party elections; however Obote died in exile a few months before. The UPC's traditional heartland in the North appeared uninterested in the UPC without Obote, but still opposed Museveni. This time they turned to Museveni's main opponent Kizza Besyigye (from the South) who led the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC).\n\nThe UPC had failed even to capitalise on its self-created dilemma (appearing to be a Northern party) by not appointing a popular Northern politician to lead the party - instead they opted for Obote's widow (Miria), a Southerner. After the elections, the party suffered many high level defections to Museveni's ruling National Resistance Movement and to the FDC. Miria's election is a source of resentment, and many Ugandans still associate the party with the military excesses of the past. In the 23 February 2006 parliamentary election, the party won nine out of 319 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThe UPC's poor performance in the 2006 elections forced the party to review its place in Ugandan politics. Uganda's political landscape is changing from regional based parties to personality driven politics. The party needed to find a leader with a recognised calibre in politics. The party chose Dr. Olara Otunnu, a former UN under secretary general for children and armed conflict. The election however revealed internal conflicts in the party that are likely to affect its performance at the 2011 elections. Otunnu served under Tito Okello as Foreign Minister and is seen by some as part of the putsch that overthrew the last UPC government in 1985.\n\nOtunnu's main rival at the party elections was Milton Obote's son Jimmy Akena, the Member of Parliament for Lira Municipality showing the Obote family still cherishes the party that Obote created.\n\nOtunnu was later voted out by the UPC fraternity, hence leading to the rise of Jimmy Akena son of the founding father of UPC. Akena became President of the Uganda People's Congress on 2 July 2015.\n\n\n"}

The city should not be confused with its older neighbor, Magnesia on the Maeander, both founded by colonists from the Greek region of Magnesia.\n\nThe first famous mention of the city is in 190 BC, when Antiochus the Great was defeated in the battle of Magnesia by the Roman consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus. It became a city of importance under Roman rule and, though nearly destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius, was restored by that emperor and flourished through the Roman empire. It was an important regional centre through the Byzantine Empire, and during the 13th-century interregnum of the Empire of Nicea. Magnesia housed the Imperial mint, the Imperial treasury, and served as the functional capital of the empire until the recovery of Constantinople in 1261. Magnesia was one of the few towns in this part of Anatolia which remained prosperous under the Turkish rule.\n\nThere are two famous relics of antiquity. The first is the Niobe of Sipylus (Aglayan Kaya), a natural rock formation, on the lowest slopes of the mountains in the middle of town. The second is the Suratlu Tash, a colossal stone carving allegedly portraying Cybele, about 100 meters up the mountain about 6 km east of the town. This is a colossal seated image cut in a niche of the rock, of Hittite origin, and perhaps that called by Pausanias the very ancient statue of the Mother of the Gods, carved by Broteas, son of Tantalus, and sung by Homer. It can be seen by driving into a parking lot at a children's playground.\n\nNear the carving lie many remains of a primitive city, and about a kilometer east is the rock-seat conjecturally identified with Pausanias's Throne of Pelops. There are also hot springs and a sacred grotto of Apollo. Parts of the major fortifications built during the Empire of Nicea remain evident.\n\nOne of the regions colonized by the Magnetes was a primary source for mysterious stones that could attract or repel each other, possibly leading to the modern term for magnets and magnetism. Some suggest that it was Magnesia ad Sipylum, others that it was the Magnesia regional unit in Thessaly; this has been debated both in modern times and in antiquity without resolution.\n\nThe town had a bishop in late antiquity, suffran to the bishop in Ephesus.\nKnown bishops include:\n\n"}

The DP was led by Paul Ssemogerere for 25 years until his retirement in November 2005. John Ssebaana Kizito replaced Ssemogerere, and led the party until February 2010, when Norbert Mao was elected party president.\n\nIn the general election of 18 February 2011, the party won 11 out of 238 elected seats. In the presidential election of the same date, Mao won 1.86 percent of the vote. As of June 2013, the party had fifteen seats in the parliament.\n\nThe DP was formed out of the religious and economic demographics that began to model politics in Buganda before Uganda's independence. Buganda is Uganda's largest ethnic region and has influenced the country's politics since the country was drawn up by the British colonial power. Buganda, like most parts of Africa before independence, had been visited by three key religious forces - the Roman Catholics, the Church of England (Protestant Christians), and Islam. They battled each other to extend their influence in Buganda and Uganda as a whole. In Buganda, all three built powerful indigenous alliances and tried to influence the Buganda King - the Kabaka. By the 1950s, the Protestants had achieved the most influence over the Kabaka.\n\nAnother important factor influencing Buganda politics at the time was what the role of the Kabaka should be in an independent Uganda. A significant majority in Buganda wanted autonomy with the Kabaka as the symbol of Bugandan self-determination. Most other people in Uganda, however, wanted a unitary modern state unhindered by traditional royalty. This aspiration was shared by some of the Buganda elite, particularly those who belonged to the Catholic Church. They formed the basis of what was to become the DP.\n\nTo the Kabaka, DP members were seen as disloyal, and, in response, the Kabaka formed an alternative more popular party in Buganda called Kabaka Yekka (\"The King Only\"). Realising they had little chance of winning support in Buganda, the DP under Benedicto Kiwanuka began to campaign for the support of other southern Bantu-speaking tribes in southern Uganda. The DP effectively became Uganda's first national political party.\n\n\"A third political force emerged from the Nilotic/Luo speaking North of Uganda.\" This statement is factually wrong. The UNC was formed in 1952. It was not led by any Nilotic. It was led by Ignatius Musazi who was a Muganda.\n\n\"In fact there was very little difference in policy between the DP and UPC.\" This statement is also factually wrong. The two parties represented grievances of different identities. DP represented the grievances of Catholics who had been discriminated against since the battle of Mengo of 1892. The UPC, on the other hand, represented the grievances of the non-Baganda who had been dominated by Baganda since 1600.\n\nThe Uganda National Congress, later to become the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), was led by Milton Obote. Like the Democratic Party, the UPC campaigned for a unitary modern state. In fact there was very little difference in policy between the DP and UPC.\n\nThe first election in Uganda prior to Independence saw the Democratic Party as the largest party, however the UPC formed an alliance of convenience with the Kabaka Yekka and Milton Obote became Prime Minister, promising to preserve the Kabaka's status in Buganda. That alliance did not last and in 1966, Obote ordered the military against the Kabaka who fled into exile. The Kabaka Yekka party was banned and Benedicto Kiwanuka was imprisoned.\n\nWhen Obote was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin, Benedicto Kiwanuka accepted a ministerial post in the new government. He was eventually murdered by Amin's agents. All political parties were banned in Uganda during Amin's rule.\n\nThe DP emerged again after Idi Amin was overthrown in 1979. The absence of the Kabaka Yekka party now made the DP the main political force in Buganda and southern Uganda, while the UPC consolidated its support in the north. This regional polarization of Ugandan politics had made the DP a convenient vehicle for Baganda to express their political aspirations, which had moved significantly towards autonomy after the apparent economic and political failure of the Ugandan state. This was further enhanced by the brutality of the new government whose army was dominated by northerners. To many Baganda, the DP was the first stage to achieving the return of the Kabaka and the \"independence\" of Buganda.\n\nThe leadership of the DP did not aspire to a share Bugandan independence, but went along with it.\n\nIn 1980, Paul Ssemogerere assumed leadership of the party. In 1984, he was reelected as leader over the challenge of Okney Atwoma. In response to Okney Atwoma's unsuccessful challenge, Atwoma established the Nationalist Liberal Party alongside former minister Anthony Ochaya, Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor, and Francis Bwenge. This new party was eventually re-integrated with the Democratic Party.\n\nPaul Ssemogerere was a political novice but used the Buganda aspiration effectively and provided a significant challenge to the UPC led once again by Obote in the 1980 elections. These elections are widely believed to have been rigged by the military junta that ruled Uganda after Amin in favour of Obote and the UPC.\n\nA third political party, the Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM) led by Yoweri Museveni, rejected the result and went to the bush to start a guerrilla war. There was pressure on the DP to reject the result, but the leadership decided to take their seats in parliament much to the disappointment of their supporters. However one of the DP's younger leaders, Andrew Kayiira, did take up arms to fight the new government, joining an organisation called the Uganda Freedom Movement.\n\nWhen Museveni came to power, he was able to outflank any support the DP retained in Buganda by allowing the Kabaka's son to return and be crowned as a ceremonial king. The DP performed so badly in the elections in 2006, it is doubtful whether the party will ever regain its popularity.\n\nSince the 2006 elections, pluralism has struggled to find its place in Ugandan politics. State sponsored in-fighting and factionalism have driven away many of its traditional supporters. They do fear that their small scale market gardening businesses, would be targeted by the NRM-No-Party-Home-grown democracy of Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni who has enjoyed fiscal economic growth up to 6%. His regime openly claims to want and need no foreign aid as Ugandans are happy to be sleeping well regardless of their surviving under minimum starvation with maximum poverty.\n\n\n"}

The provision gives current shareholders of a targeted company, other than the hostile acquirer, rights to purchase additional stocks in the targeted company at a discount. These rights to purchase occur only before a potential takeover, and when the acquirer surpasses a certain threshold point of obtaining outstanding shares (usually 20 - 50%). If the potential acquirer triggers a poison pill by accumulating more than the threshold level of shares, it risks discriminatory dilution in the target company. The threshold level therefore effectively sets a ceiling on the amount of stock that any shareholder can accumulate before being required, for practical purposes, to launch a proxy contest.\n\nIn 2004, PeopleSoft was employing the flip-in model against Oracle Corporation's multi-billion hostile takeover bid.

He was named one of the Top 10 Freshmen in the country by Sports Illustrated. During his freshman year, he ran for 277 yards with 1 TD on 77 carries (3.6 avg.) in 10 games. He started there as a running back before switching to safety in the middle of the 2000 season. Yet his college career at Michigan was cut short during his freshman season when he broke his leg. He was redshirted in 1999 while he rehabilitated his broken right leg.\n\nAfter looking at both California and USC, Fargas chose to transfer to USC in 2001. Due to NCAA transfer rules he sat out the 2001 season.

He is the 49ers all-time leader in rushing yards.\n\nIn his NFL career, Gore has had nine 1,000-rushing-yard seasons and five Pro Bowl selections. While achieving some personal success, he struggled with a team that suffered numerous losing seasons until he and the 49ers achieved a 13–3 record in the 2011 season under new head coach Jim Harbaugh. That season, the 49ers won the NFC West division and reached the NFC championship game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants. In 2012, Gore helped lead the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, although they would lose to the Baltimore Ravens. In 2011, Gore became the 49ers career rushing yards leader. In 2014, Gore became the 29th player to have rushed for over 10,000 yards.

He finished the season seventh among all NFL rookie running backs in rushing average with 4.8 average per run. He led the team in rushing with 608 yards on 127 carries and three rushing touchdowns. Gore also caught 15 passes for 131 yards. Gore's season was the first time a rookie led the 49ers in rushing since 1990, when Dexter Carter paced the team with 460 yards. His 608 yards rushing was the highest for a 49ers rookie since Roger Craig had 725 yards rushing in 1983.\n\nGore rushed for 17 yards on four carries and caught two passes for 21 yards in his NFL debut, a 28–25 victory over the St. Louis Rams. He later rushed for 42 yards on seven carries with a 5.4-yard average in a 34–31 loss the Dallas Cowboys. He led the team with 89 yards on nine carries and recorded a then career-long 72-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter of the 52–17 road loss to the Washington Redskins. The touchdown was the longest run from scrimmage by a 49ers player since running back Kevan Barlow had a 78-yard rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2003. The touchdown run was fifth-longest run from scrimmage by a 49ers rookie. He led the team in rushing for the third straight week with 55 yards on 14 carries (3.9-yard avg.) at the Chicago Bears, with a 19-yard long.

Gore carried the ball 312 times for a franchise-record 1,695 yards, eclipsing Garrison Hearst’s 1998 record of 1,570 yards. He became the first player in franchise history to lead the NFC in rushing yards. He set a franchise record with 2,180 combined yards (1,695 yards rushing and 485 yards receiving), breaking Hearst’s single-season record of 2,105 total yards (1,570 rushing and 535 receiving) set in 1998. His total placed him second in the NFC to Steven Jackson (1,528 rushing and 806 receiving, 2,334 total) and fourth overall in the entire NFL. In the 49ers’ first meeting against the Seattle Seahawks, Gore set the 49ers’ single-game rushing record by totaling a career-high 212 yards on 24 carries, besting the 201 yards by Charlie Garner on September 24, 2000 against the Dallas Cowboys. Gore had nine 100-yard rushing games in 2006, giving him ten for his career. His nine 100-yard games in 2006 shattered the franchise record for most 100-yard games in a season. Garrison Hearst (1998) and Roger Craig (1988) each had six 100-yard games in a season. Gore was the first 49ers running back to have three-straight 100 yard games since Garrison Hearst had a 49ers-record four straight 100-yard games during Weeks 13-16 of the 1998 season. In those three weeks, Gore set the team record for most rushing yards in a three-game span.\n\nGore's breakaway ability helped him finish the season with 5.4 yards per carry, placing him third in the entire NFL, behind only Michael Vick (8.4 YPC on 123 carries) and Maurice Jones-Drew (5.7 YPC on 166 carries). The 5.4 yards per carry are tied for the second-best in 49ers history. Among players with over 300 carries, however, Gore's season puts him in elite company. Very few times has a player averaged as many yards per carry as Gore did while carrying the ball over 300 times. The players ahead of him contain Hall of Famers and feature five 2,000-yard rushing seasons.\n\nGore finished with eight rushing touchdowns, tied for the third-most in a season by a 49er. He finished the season with a team-leading 61 receptions. Only two other teams had a running back as their leading receiver: New Orleans (Reggie Bush) and Philadelphia (Brian Westbrook). Of those, only Gore and Westbrook also led their team in rushing. He also caught his first receiving touchdown of his career on the road against the Seattle Seahawks, when quarterback Alex Smith avoided a sack and found Gore along the left sideline for a 20-yard score. He led the NFL with 16 rushes for 20 or more yards. Gore earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors twice during the 2006 season. He earned the honor in Week 5 after rushing for 134 yards on 27 carries, and catching three passes for 38 yards, against the Oakland Raiders. In addition, he won in Week 11 after his franchise-record 212 rushing yards, and 26 yards on four receptions, against the Seattle Seahawks. After Gore's tremendous season, he was named the starting running back to the NFC Pro Bowl team in his first Pro Bowl nomination.\n\nAt some point during his breakout season, Gore was given the nickname \"The Inconvenient Truth\", which stuck with him for the rest of his career. The nickname was inspired by the movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\" written by former United States Vice President Al Gore, which was released in May of the same year.\n\nGore had benefited that season from the tutelage of then-offensive coordinator Norv Turner, whose offensive scheme places a heavy emphasis on running the football.\n\nThough Gore had fumbling problems at the beginning of the season, losing the ball once in each of the first four games, he improved his carrying and only fumbled three more times the rest of the year.\n\nGore signed a contract extension through 2011 estimated to be worth $28 million over four years on March 28, 2007. He also stated that it was his goal to surpass Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record in 2007. He said that he would gain 2,200 yards.\n\nGore broke a bone in his hand in the non-contact Training Camp drill on July 30 and missed the entire preseason. He was able to return in time for the regular season opener against the Arizona Cardinals on September 10. On September 13, Gore's mother died, due to a kidney disease. He missed a practice, but returned to the team and scored two touchdowns the following Sunday in a 17–16 win over the St. Louis Rams. Gore's best game came against the Arizona Cardinals in their divisional rematch in Week 12, where he recorded 116 rushing yards and had 11 receptions for 98 receiving yards and two rushing touchdowns. For his efforts, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 15, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had a season-high 138 rushing yards in the 20–13 victory. He finished the season with 1,102 rushing yards and 436 receiving yards as the 49ers finished with a 5–11 record.\n\nGore began the 2008 season against the Arizona Cardinals with 96 rushing yards on only 14 carries. Despite his impressive performance, which also included a 41-yard touchdown run, the 49ers lost, 23–13.\n\nIn Week 3, he dominated the Detroit Lions, rushing for over 120 yards and a touchdown in a 31–13 victory. In Week 6, Gore had his second 100-yard game of the season, as he rushed for 101 yards on 19 carries in a 40–26 defeat against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn a Week 17 victory against the visiting Washington Redskins, Gore became the first running back in 49ers history to rush for 1,000 yards or more in three straight seasons. In the 2008 season, Gore finished with 1,036 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go along with 43 receptions for 373 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns.\n\nGore entered the 2009 season under the guidance of new running back coach Tom Rathman. He was also complemented by a new second-string back, 49ers' third-round draft pick Glen Coffee.\n\nAfter being nearly shut down in Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals, Gore had a career day the following week in the home opener versus the Seattle Seahawks. Gore rushed for 206 yards for a 12.8-yard average, including a 79-yard and an 80-yard touchdown run, becoming the second player in NFL history to rush for two touchdowns for 75 yards or more in a single game, with the other being Hall-of-Fame running back Barry Sanders. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for the fourth time in his career.\nAfter missing his next two games against the St. Louis Rams and Atlanta Falcons due to an ankle injury, Gore returned in Week 7 against the Houston Texans. While he had a successful game against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, gaining 104 yards with a touchdown, he was used less in the 49ers' offensive game plan in the following three weeks, after the team adopted more of a spread offense. In the 49ers' second divisional game against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14, Gore had one of his most successful games of the season, rushing for 167 yards on 25 carries and one touchdown. He earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for the 2009 season. Against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, Gore had 16 carries for 107 yards against an Eagles team that had not given up a 100-yard game in 22 consecutive games. Gore was named a first alternate for the 2009 Pro Bowl. On January 20, 2010, Steven Jackson announced he would not be playing in the Pro Bowl because of injury, so Gore was named to the 2010 Pro Bowl in his spot, the second of his career.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season with 17 carries for 38 rushing yards against the Seattle Seahawks, Gore had 168 scrimmage yards (112 rushing, 56 receiving) against the New Orleans Saints in Week 2. In Week 3, against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had nine receptions for 102 receiving yards, his only career game with over 100 receiving yards. He had rushed for four 100-yard games before fracturing his right hip in a Week 12 win over the Arizona Cardinals, ending his season after the 49ers put him on IR. Gore finished with 853 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns to go along with 46 receptions for 452 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. He was ranked 94th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.\n\nGore agreed to a three-year extension, worth $25.9 million, on August 30, 2011. The extension kept Gore with the San Francisco 49ers through the 2014 season.\n\nDuring the offseason, the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh to be their new head coach and built themselves around a combination of a great running game, a supplemental passing game and a power house defense. This combination proved to be effective for Gore and the 49ers, leading them to a 13–3 record in the regular season and a playoff spot for the 49ers, their first such appearance since 2002 along with a first round bye.\n\nIn the first three games of the season, Gore did not perform well, rushing for 148 yards on 59 carries for only one rushing touchdown. In Week 4, the 49ers were down 23–3 at the end of the first half when quarterback Alex Smith and Gore both led drives to make the final score 24–23 and a 49ers win. Gore rushed for 127 yards on 15 carries and rushed for the game-winning touchdown when four minutes were left in the game. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Gore rushed for 125 yards and one touchdown in the 48–3 win for the 49ers. However, his performance in that game was eclipsed by his performance against the Detroit Lions, where he rushed a season-high of 141 yards on 15 carries and a touchdown in a 25–19 win for the 49ers, defeating the previously unbeaten Lions.\n\nThe next few games went pretty well for Gore, rushing for 134 yards and a touchdown against the Cleveland Browns and 107 yards against the Washington Redskins, becoming the 49ers record holder of most consecutive games with 100 yards with five. However, against the Giants, Gore had an unmemorable performance, rushing for 0 yards and leaving in the second half with a knee injury. This was Gore's first game with 0 rushing yards.

Next week, however, he rushed for only 39 yards against the Baltimore Ravens powerful defense in 49ers 6–16 loss. The next game, however, proved to be a 49ers win against the St. Louis Rams, where Gore became the 49ers' all-time leading yardage rusher, surpassing Joe Perry's mark of 8,689 yards; he rushed for 73 yards on the game. The next week Gore performed well despite losing the game 19–21, rushing for 72 yards and the 49ers only touchdown.\n\nHe managed to finish the season on a high note, with a three-game winning streak, including one against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he rushed 65 yards and a touchdown. He finished the season with 1,211 yards, having had five seasons with at least 1,000 rushing yards.\n\nDuring the playoffs, Gore performed exceedingly well, helping the 49ers set up a touchdown by rushing for 42 yards in the in his playoff debut, a 36–32 victory over the New Orleans Saints; he had a total of 89 yards in the game.

The 8–8 49ers struggled all season to find an identity, and featured Gore's running game prominently after being eliminated from the playoffs. He rushed for 158 yards and a season-long 52-yard touchdown on 26 carries as the 49ers lost in overtime to the San Diego Chargers in Week 16 by a score of 35–38, and in his final game with the 49ers, he rushed for 144 yards on 25 carries as the 49ers beat the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 20–17. Gore finished the season with 255 carries, 1,106 rushing yards, and four touchdowns, and became the 20th player in NFL history to rush for 11,000 career rushing yards, moving up from 29th place on the all-time rushing yards leaderboard at the start of the season.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, Gore signed a three-year, $12 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts. His contract included $8.5 million in guarantees. Prior to signing with the Colts, it was widely reported that Gore had agreed to a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles on March 9 to replace LeSean McCoy. However, the following day several sources claimed that Gore had second thoughts about his agreement, and instead signed with Indianapolis.\n\nGore enjoyed a respectable season, but 2015 marked the first season that Gore played all 16 games and did not record at least 1,000 rushing yards. Gore finished ninth in the league in rushing yards with 967 and had six touchdowns, while also adding 34 receptions for 267 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown. Gore found the endzone twice as part of a 86-rushing yard performance in Week 3 against the Tennessee Titans in a 35–33 victory. He had a productive game against the Miami Dolphins, where quarterback Matt Hasselbeck was injured in what was the final game of his career. Gore stepped up to engineer an 18–14 win with 85 rushing yards on 15 carries with two rushing touchdowns. He moved up five more places to 15th all-time in rushing yards, and also passed Steven Jackson in early October to become the NFL's active leader in career rushing yards.\n\nIn Week 1, Gore carried the ball 14 times for 59 yards in a 39–35 loss to the Detroit Lions. In Week 2, the Colts faced the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos and their vaunted defense. Gore did not have a great showing, rushing for 44 yards on 13 carries, but did have a seven-yard touchdown reception from Andrew Luck in the 34–20 loss. Gore had a better game in Week 3, rushing for 82 yards and a touchdown in a 26–22 victory over the San Diego Chargers. On October 9, against the Chicago Bears, Gore surpassed Jim Brown in career rushing yards. Gore carried that momentum into Week 6 against the Houston Texans, rushing for 106 yards on 22 carries to become the Colts' first 100-yard rusher in 55 games. After the 26–23 loss to the Texans, Gore voiced his frustration with the team losing, saying \"I didn't come here for this, I came here to get into the tournament.\"\nIn Week 8, Gore tied Terrell Owens, Marvin Harrison, Tim Brown, Cris Carter, Jerry Rice, and Don Hutson for the most consecutive seasons (11) with at least five touchdowns. In Week 15 against the Minnesota Vikings' third ranked defense, Gore hit the century mark for the second time this season, rushing for 101 yards on 26 carries. Gore finished the season with 1,025 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. The 2016 season marked the ninth time Gore rushed for 1,000 yards in his career. He joined Pro Football Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith (11), Curtis Martin (10), Walter Payton (10) and Barry Sanders (10) as the only players in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards in at least nine different seasons. He became the Colts first running back to rush for 1,000 yards since Joseph Addai in 2007. He moved up seven more places to eighth on the all-time career rushing list.\n\nThe 2017 offseason, Gore trained for the season in a familiar fashion, down in Miami working out with younger running backs from around the league. The Colts brought in competition at the running back position drafting Marlon Mack to compete for the starting job. Gore embraced the competition saying \"to have depth to compete, I feel like everybody should have depth to compete at their position. The more people you've got, the hungrier that person should be. You know the guys from last year and adding the new young guys come training camp time the best man should win. If you love this game you're gonna step up to the plate.\" In the season opener, Andrew Luck's shoulder injury prevented him from playing so the offense struggled against the Los Angeles Rams, losing 46–9, and Gore only got 10 rushing attempts for 42 yards. In Week 2, in a 16–13 overtime loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Gore rushed for 46 yards and his first rushing touchdown of the 2017 season, moving him into the top 25 all-time for career rushing touchdowns. This was followed by 57 yards and a touchdown in a Week 3 31–28 win over the Cleveland Browns, then four consecutive games under 50 yards, before 82-, 51-, and 54-yard performances in Weeks 8 through 10, all with zero touchdowns over the seven-game span. After the bye, Gore had 62 yards and a touchdown in a Week 12 20–16 loss to the Tennessee Titans, and 61 yards in Week 13 to pass both Jerome Bettis and LaDanian Tomlinson and move up to fifth on the all-time rushing list. Playing against the Buffalo Bills in a blizzard and deep snow in Week 14, Gore had a career-high 36 rush attempts for 130 yards, his highest yardage total in his three years with the Colts, in the 13–7 overtime loss. Gore finished the season with 961 rushing yards, bringing his career total to 14,026. He became the fifth player in NFL history to amass 14,000 rushing yards in his career, joining Emmitt Smith, Walter Payton, Barry Sanders, and Curtis Martin. On March 1, 2018, the Colts announced that they would not re-sign Gore, allowing him to become a free agent at the start of the new league year.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, Gore signed a one-year contract, worth $1,105,000, with the Miami Dolphins.\n\nGore shared the backfield with Kenyan Drake and rookie Kalen Ballage. With his five-yard rush in the third quarter of the Miami Dolphins' 20–12 victory over the New York Jets, in Week 2 of the 2018 season, Gore passed Curtis Martin for fourth-most rushing yards all time with 14,103. In Week 4, against the New England Patriots, he caught a six-yard touchdown from Brock Osweiler in the 38–7 loss. In a 31–28 overtime victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 6, Gore recorded 15 carries for 101 rushing yards. In Week 15, Gore suffered a sprained foot against the Minnesota Vikings and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Overall, Gore finished with 722 rushing yards on 156 carries. The 2018 season was the first time in his career he did not record a rushing touchdown.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, Gore signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Buffalo Bills. After rushing for 20 yards on twelve carries against the New York Jets to the start the 2019 season, Gore had 19 carries for 68 rushing yards and his first rushing touchdown since Week 12 of the 2017 season in the 28–14 victory over the New York Giants in Week 2. During Week 4 against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Gore became the fourth player in NFL history to run for 15,000 yards after rushing 17 times for 109 yards, also becoming the second oldest player in NFL history with a 100+ yard rushing game, 61 days younger than MacArthur Lane in 1978. Despite his valiant efforts, the Bills lost the game 10–16. During the Week 12 game against the Denver Broncos, Gore surpassed Barry Sanders' career total of 15,269 rushing yards for third place all time. This was Gore's 15th season with 500+ yards rushing, an NFL record. He finished with 65 yards on 15 carries in Buffalo's 20–3 win. Gore finished the 2019 season with 599 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns to go along with 13 receptions for 100 receiving yards. He ended up leading the team in carries while sharing the backfield with rookie Devin Singletary. With the Bills appearing in the , Gore made his first postseason appearance since his time with the San Francisco 49ers in the 2013 season. Against the Houston Texans, Gore had eight carries for 22 rushing yards in the 22–19 overtime loss.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, Gore signed a one-year deal with the New York Jets.\n\n\n\n\nGore (Sr.)'s eldest son, Frank Gore (Jr.), was born in 2002 while Gore Sr. was in college at the University of Miami. Gore Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and plays running back. Gore Sr. did not plan for his son to end up playing football, remarking: \"\"Whatever he wants to do, he’s going to do it; not because I played ball, he has to play ball. Me seeing him when he was a little kid playing outside with his bigger cousins, I knew he was going to play football. But if he doesn’t want to play, as long as he gets his grades and does something positive with his life, I’m okay with it.\"\" Due to his NFL career, Frank Gore Sr. was unable to see his son play in local football games past the age of 5 until his return to Miami 13 years later when he signed with the Miami Dolphins. Citing a desire to not have an easy road for his first born, Gore took his son out of private school in 2017 and enrolled him at Coral Gables Senior High School, his alma mater. Gore Jr. later transferred to Miami Killian High School where he has remained since his sophomore season. On May 31, 2018, Gore Sr. welcomed the Killian High School football team to a visit of the Dolphins' practice. During Gore Sr.'s tenure with the Miami Dolphins, every Saturday morning father and son would awake before sunrise and travel to the Bommarito Performance Center where beginning at 7:00 AM, the two would run, pull sleds, practice lateral & agility drills, undergo a variety of strength and endurance conditioning, and core exercises; after a rest period, the two would repeat the workout all over again in the evening. A Class of 2020 recruit, Gore Jr. received his first college offer from Coach Mark Stoops of the University of Kentucky on September 7, 2018; Stoops had coached at the University of Miami during Gore Sr.'s collegiate career. On December 19, 2019, Gore Jr., a three-star prospect, committed to play football at University of Southern Mississippi after also receiving offers from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and Florida Atlantic University.\n\nGore is the cousin of football brothers Jason Frierson (wide receiver), Shaquille Cooper (running back), Shakur Cooper (linebacker), and Gilbert Frierson (defensive back), all of whom also attended Coral Gables High School in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami.\n\nJason Frierson played quarterback, wide receiver, running back, cornerback, safety and as a return man on special teams for the Coral Gables Cavaliers, leading the team to its first district title in 17 years. Jason played wide receiver and occasional punt returner from 2007–2010 with the Florida International University Panthers. After an all-American career for the Fort Hays State University Tigers from 2011–2016, Shaquille Cooper signed a free agent contract with and presently plays for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Shaquille cites the elder Gore (a 10-year age difference) as a long-time source of motivation and guidance during periods of hardship and the two continue to workout together in the off-season. While in high school and college, Gore would put Shaquille and Shakur (then elementary school students) into a homemade tire and run solo drills dragging them across the football field after dark at 10:00PM. Shakur Cooper has played linebacker for the Florida International University Panthers. Gilbert Frierson joined the University of Miami Hurricanes in January 2018 and presently plays striker, a “mix between linebackers and safeties.” \n\nOn April 12, 2018, Gore was honored by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and given the 'Keys to the City'. As per Mayor Suarez, Gore \"“symbolizes the very soul of [Miami], is a product of our city, a product of the West Grove, where so many families for so many generations have grown up together.”\" While receiving applause, Gore asked for his family and friends in attendance at the event to stand to be honoured as well. In Gore's view, it was equally important to thank and honour those who had been with him throughout all the hardships he had faced in his life, including \"\"growing up in a one-bedroom apartment with twelve people as a kid.\"\" Mayor Suarez proclaimed April 12 as “Frank Gore Day.”\n\n\n"}

He played as an outside forward and was capped 20 times for his country.\n\nConnelly began his playing career with St Helens Town in the Lancashire Combination. In November 1956, scouts from Burnley came to watch another player, but were so impressed by Connelly that he was offered a trial with Burnley, and subsequently made a permanent move to the club, who were then playing in the English top division. He made his debut away from home against Leeds United on 11 March 1957. It took two seasons for Connelly to gain a permanent place in the Burnley first team, which he did in the 1958–59 season, scoring 12 goals from 37 appearances, and ending the season as the team's second top scorer.\n\nHe was predominantly a right winger who could also play on the left. He had the ball control and speed to beat the full back on the outside and deliver accurate crosses, but was also able to cut inside and score goals with either foot. For a winger, he was always a prolific goal scorer, scoring 105 goals for Burnley in 265 appearances.\n\nIn the 1959–60 season, Connelly played a crucial part in helping Burnley to end as league champions for only the second time. He scored 20 goals in 34 league appearances. Unfortunately for him, he missed the vital last game against Manchester City that gave Burnley the title. His replacement, Trevor Meredith, scored the final winning goal while Connelly was in hospital having a cartilage operation. However, he still received a Championship winner's medal.\n\nIn the following three seasons, Connelly played a full part and scored plenty of goals to help Burnley finish fourth, second and third, respectively, in the league. In addition to finishing second in the 1961–62 season, Burnley reached the FA Cup final where they were beaten 3–1 by Tottenham Hotspur. Connelly played on the right wing and received a runners-up medal. In the 1963–64 season, the emergence of a talented young Scottish winger, Willie Morgan, meant that Connelly was forced to play on the left wing. In April 1964 he was transferred to Manchester United for £56,000.\n\nConnelly stayed at Manchester United for just over two seasons, making 113 appearances and scoring 35 goals. In that first season his new club finished second, but the next season, 1964–65, they finished as league champions and Connelly received a second championship medal to go with the one he won with Burnley. The following season,1965–66, the team finished fourth in the league and were knocked out of the European Cup in the semi-finals. At the start of the 1966–67 season, Connelly was transferred to newly relegated Blackburn Rovers for £40,000.\n\nHe played for Blackburn Rovers for four years, but was unable to help get them back into the top division. He was released by Blackburn in May 1970 and signed for Bury. He stayed with Bury for three years and retired in May 1973. In recent years he owned a fish and chip shop in Brierfield, known as \"Connelly's Plaice\". Connelly was chosen amongst 25 former Burnley players for a \"Wall of Legends\" at Turf Moor.\n\nConnelly died at home on 25 October 2012, at the age of 74. Burnley Football Club released a statement: \"One of Burnley's most prolific and popular wingers, he died peacefully at home on Thursday morning.\" Turf Moor's flag flew at half mast in his memory. Players wore black armbands in respect of his death.\n\nConnelly made his England international debut whilst still a Burnley player, on 17 October 1959, against Wales at Ninian Park. He played twenty games for England in all and scored seven goals. He was a member of the England squad that was sent out to Chile to take part in the 1962 FIFA World Cup, but he was not selected to play during England's participation in the tournament. Four years later he was a member of the England squad which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He played in the opening game against Uruguay at Wembley Stadium, but the match was a goalless draw and England were disappointing. For subsequent games Alf Ramsey, the England manager, decided to drop Connelly and later do without wingers. This proved to be his last international game. Connelly was one of four England players to play for England in the tournament without playing in the final itself, the others being Jimmy Greaves, Terry Paine and Ian Callaghan.\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup final only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Connelly was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. Connelly was the third of the 1966 World Cup winning squad to die, Bobby Moore and Alan Ball having predeceased him.\n\n\n\n"}

There is one operating research reactor on the premises of the Petten research centre: a high flux reactor.\n\nApart from its function as a research centre, Petten is also a large producer of radioactive material for the purpose of medical diagnosis and the treatment of cancer and contrast agents (Radiopharmaceuticals). The nuclear facilities at Petten supply 60% of the European demand for medical isotopes. Also at the high flux reactor, one of the neutron beam channels, which was originally installed for performing fundamental research, has been specially modified for the direct irradiation of patients. This allows use of neutrons for the treatment of tumors after saturation of these tumors with a pharmaceutical containing boron. When hit by a weak neutron beam, boron will locally emit radiation that will destroy the tumor. This technique is mainly suitable for the treatment of brain tumors.\n\n, only low-enriched uranium fuel was used at the facilities in Petten. As a result of political pressure from the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), research reactors are no longer allowed to use highly enriched uranium fuel because of its potential use for the production of nuclear weapons. The use of highly enriched uranium targets for the production of medical isotopes was discontinued in January 2018.\n\nThe high flux reactor in Petten has been in use since 1961. The first criticality was obtained on 9 November 1961. The reactor was furnished by Allis-Chalmers.\n\nIts capacity was increased in steps to 45 MW (thermal) by 1970. The reactor is property of the European Commission and is operated by the Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG).\n\nFrom August 2008 the reactor was shut down due to corrosion of the pipes in its primary cooling circuit. The operator is expecting to bring the plant back on-line in February 2009.\n\nThe low flux reactor was first used in 1960 and permanently shut down in 2010. It had a capacity of 30 kW. The reactor was property of the Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG) and mainly used for the production of neutrons for biological and physical research.\n\nIn 2009 the Argentine company INVAP (teamed with Spanish group Isolux) was pre selected in the international tender for the PALLAS project, for the procurement of an 80 MW nuclear reactor for the Dutch village of Petten \nbut on February 2010, the Dutch radiopharmaceutical producer Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG) extended the preparatory phase up to end of the year for financing \n\nIn mid-May 2014, NRG, the company that operates the reactor, asked for a bridging loan at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, because of the financial losses in the previous years. A bankruptcy could not be ruled out, if the credit would be refused. In addition, there were negotiations with the banks, because of the estimated 80 million euros, needed for the upcoming maintenance of the 50-year-old reactor.\n\nIn 2002, the High Flux Reactor was shut down for a few weeks because of two unrelated issues. There were indications of a weld defect in the reactor vessel and there were some concerns about the safety culture within the company. After completion of extensive research and the announcement of a series of additional measures, the reactor was put back into use.\n\n, former director of ECN Petten, and former professor of physics and dean of mathematics and natural Sciences at the University of Leiden published in November his book \"Darwin meets Einstein\". In his book Saris mentioned two previously not noted incidents which he gives as the reason for his resigning from ECN. Saris says the following\nand\n\nThere have been a number of issues raised in reports stating protocol breaches and insufficient safety culture in the reactor as well as requests from parliament members to shut down the reactor. The reactor has been shut down a number of times since 2012 with different issues including radioactive waste leaking, tritium leaking into the surrounding underground waters and control rod problems. New allegations from Frans Saris and 3 INES2 scale incidents in 2013 in an article in 2016 arose.\n\n\n"}

The name \"Talent\" is an acronym in German for \"TALbot LEichter Nahverkehrs Triebwagen\" (in English, \"Talbot light suburban railcar\").\n\nIt comes in a number of variants, including high-floor, low-floor, diesel-mechanical, diesel-hydraulic, diesel-electric, electric, and tilting, and in lengths of two, three, or four carriages. As with most multiple-unit trains, Talent units can run individually, or be coupled together to form longer trains.\n\nClassified as heavy rail according to UIC standards, the Talent is a two-, three- or four-part articulated railcar with Jacobs bogies. Partially as a result of this, the interior of an entire unit is essentially a single, long cabin; it is possible to see or walk from end to end without opening doors or passing through narrower gangways. The sharing of bogies also means that a Talent unit cannot be easily disassembled or rearranged without the assistance of a railway yard. In those variants whose floor is above the rails, this means that the articulation floor is raised, but with ramp access, since it needs to be higher than the wheel diameter, above rail level. In the variants with floor height, the floor is flat from the first door to the last. The endsections have a raised floor in all variants, because the traction equipment installed underneath requires more space than unpowered bogies.\n\nAfter a prototype was presented in 1994, the first Talents entered service in 1996. They are used by mainline railways in Germany, Austria and Norway. More than 260 are in service worldwide.\n\nIn a more unusual use, three diesel Talents identical to Deutsche Bahn's class 643 once formed the fleet for Ottawa's O-Train Trillium Line, a diesel light rail transit line running entirely within the City of Ottawa. The Trillium Line shares a lightly used freight railway line. As the Talent is not certified for concurrent shared-track operation with freight trains in North America, freight traffic is not permitted on the Trillium Line's route while passenger services are running. Although it is still legally classified as a main-line railway, Transport Canada allow the O-Train Trillium Line to use One-Person Train Operation, with fares collected through a proof-of-payment system. In March 2015, all three Talent units were replaced by Alstom Coradia LINT diesel units.\n\nThe Talent has now been superseded by the Bombardier Talent 2 and Talent 3.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bouffard. It is a member of a new class of antifungals termed the echinocandins. It works by inhibiting the enzyme (1→3)-β--glucan synthase and thereby disturbing the integrity of the fungal cell wall. Caspofungin was the first inhibitor of fungal (1→3)-β--glucan synthesis to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nCaspofungin is administered intravenously.\n\nCaspofungin has been effective in treating fungal infections caused by \"Aspergillus\" and \"Candida\" species. It is a member of the echinocandin family, a new class of antifungal agents with broad spectrum of activity against all Candida species. In comparison to treatment with either fluconazole or Amphotericin B, all three drugs in this class have been demonstrated to be highly effective or superior in well-defined clinical settings including invasive Candida infections, Candida oesophagitis and candidaemia. Higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these agents has been observed against C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii.\n\nThe following summarizes MIC susceptibility for a few medically significant organisms.\n\nCaspofungin acetate for injection was originally approved by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in the U.S., and the EMEA, in Europe, in 2001.\n\nIts currently approved therapeutic indications by both organisations include the empirical therapy of presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic adult patients and for salvage therapy in patients treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adult patients whose disease is refractory to, or who are intolerant of, other antifungal agents (i.e., conventional or lipid formulations of amphotericin B and/or itraconazole). Additionally, the FDA approval includes indication for the treatment of candidemia and some specific \"Candida\" infections (intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, pleural cavity infections, and esophagitis) and the EMEA approval includes indication for the treatment of general invasive candidiasis in adult patients.\n\nSlowly metabolized by peptide hydrolysis and \"N\"-acetylation in liver. Therefore, in case of liver impairment the dose needs to be reduced. Caspofungin also undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation to an open-ring peptide compound, L-747969. Additional metabolism involves hydrolysis into constitutive amino acids and their derivatives, including dihydroxyhomotyrosine and \"N\"-acetyl-dihydroxyhomotyrosine.\n\nAbout 36% of patients refractory to other therapies responded well to caspofungin therapy, while even 70% of patients intolerant to other therapies were classified as responders. Direct comparative studies to other drugs in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis have so far not been undertaken.\n\nKnown hypersensitivity to caspofungin acetate or any other ingredient contained in the formulation contraindicate its use.\n\n\nThe concomitant use of caspofungin and cyclosporine in healthy volunteers led to a more frequent increase of liver enzymes (ALT=SGPT and AST=SGOT) than noted with cyclosporine alone. Combination treatment is only indicated if the potential benefit for the patient outweighs the potential risk.\n\nDosage reduction in patients with moderately impaired liver function is recommended. No clinical data exist regarding the use of caspofungin in patients with severely impaired liver function.\n\nReactions due to histamine release (rash, facial swelling, pruritus, sensation of warmth and one case of anaphylaxis) have been seen. Health-care providers should carefully watch for these reactions.\n\nIn a few patients with infections caused by \"Candida albicans\", mutants with reduced sensitivity to caspofungin have been noticed. Currently there are no data regarding development of resistance in other fungi than \"C. albicans\".\n\nCaspofungin has been shown in animal studies to have embroyotoxic properties, and therefore has been assigned to class C. It should only be given to pregnant women if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to her fetus.\n\nThe drug is found in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known whether this is seen in humans. Thus, lactating women should be treated cautiously.\n\nOrdinarily, no dose adjustments are necessary, however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\nCaspofungin is FDA approved for pediatric patients 3 months and older. Dosing is based on body surface area (BSA) as calculated by the Mosteller formula.\n\nCompared to amphotericin B, caspofungin seems to have a relatively low incidence of side effects. In clinical studies and postmarketing reports, the side effects seen in 1% or more of the patients were as follows:\n\n\nAdditionally, infrequent cases of symptomatic liver damage, peripheral edema and swelling, and hypercalcemia have been seen. One case of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) has also been noted.\n\nResistance in \"C. albicans\" has been described, but is currently still rare. The mechanism is probably a point mutation in the (1→3)-β--glucan synthase gene.\n\n\nThe mean duration of therapy in previous studies was 34 days. Some patients were even healed by a one-day treatment. However, a few patients were treated for as long as 162 days and tolerated the drug well, indicating that longtime use may be indicated and tolerated favourably in complicated cases of aspergillosis. Generally, the duration of treatment is dictated by the severity of the disease, the clinical response, and the improvement of immunocompetence in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAn initial dose of 70 mg by intravenous infusion is given followed by 50 mg intravenous daily. If no response is seen or if inducers of caspofungin clearance (see above) are coadministered the daily dose may be increased to 70 mg. An infusion should take approximately 1 hour.\n\n\nCaspofungin is semisynthesized from pneumocandin B0, a fermentation product of \"Glarea lozoyensis\".\n\n"}

The medusa usually lives upside-down on the bottom, which has earned them the common name. These jellyfish partake in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates and therefore, must lay upside-down in areas with sufficient light penetration to fuel their energy source.

The photosynthesis occurs because, like most corals, they host zooxanthellae in their tissues. The stinging cells are also found in cellular masses, dubbed \"cassiosomes\", excreted in a mucus; swimmers swimming near the jellyfish may come in contact with these cassiosomes and be stung. The stings, appearing in the form of a red rash-like skin irritation, are known for being extraordinarily itchy. Sometimes this jellyfish is picked up by the crab \"Dorippe frascone\" and carried on its back. The crab uses the jellyfish to defend itself against possible predators.\n\nCertain species of \"Cassiopea\" have been observed to enter a sleep state, indicated by a decreased pulsation rate.\n\n"}

He was educated at Avignon under a Protestant tutor, and had begun the study of law in Paris when he enlisted in the French army as an archer.\n\nHe served under the lieutenant-general of his native province of Dauphiné, Bertrand de Simiane, baron de Gordes, but when the Huguenots raised troops in Dauphiné Lesdiguières threw in his lot with them, and under his kinsman , whom he succeeded in 1570, distinguished himself in the mountain warfare that followed by his bold yet prudent handling of troops. He fought at the Battle of Jarnac and the Battle of Moncontour, and was a guest at the wedding of Henry III of Navarre (later king of France). Warned of the impending St. Bartholomew's Day massacre he retired hastily to Dauphiné, where he secretly equipped and drilled a determined body of Huguenots, and in 1575, after the execution of Charles du Puy de Montbrun in Grenoble, became the acknowledged leader of the Huguenot resistance in the district with the title of commandant general, confirmed in 1577 by Marshal Doraville, by Henry II, Prince of Condé in 1580, and by Henry of Navarre in 1582.\n\nHe seized Gap by a lucky night attack on 3 January 1577, re-established the reformed religion there, and fortified the town. He refused to acquiesce in the treaty of Poitiers (1578) which involved the surrender of Gap, and after two years of fighting secured better terms for the province. Nevertheless, in 1580 he was compelled to hand the place over to Mayenne and to see the fortifications dismantled.\nHe took up arms for Henry IV in 1585, capturing Chorges, Embrun, Châteauroux and other places, and after the truce of 1588–1589 secured the complete submission of Dauphiné. In 1590 he beat down the resistance of Grenoble, and was now able to threaten the leaguers and to support the governor of Provence against the raids of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. He defeated the Savoyards at Esparron in April 1591, and began in 1592 the reconquest of the marquessate of Saluzzo which had been seized by Charles Emmanuel. After the seizing of Grenoble in December 1590, he built new walls for the city in 1606 and fortified the hill of the Bastille between 1611 and 1619.\n\nAfter his defeat of the Spanish allies of Savoy at Salbertrand in June 1593 there was a truce, during which Lesdiguières was occupied in maintaining the royal authority against Épernon in Provence. The war with Savoy proceeded intermittently until 1605, when Henry IV concluded peace, much to the dissatisfaction of Lesdiguières.\n\nThe king regarded his lieutenant's domination in Dauphiné with some distrust, although he was counted among the best of his captains. Nevertheless, he made him a marshal of France in 1609, and ensured the succession to the lieutenant-generalship of Dauphiné, vested in Lesdiguières since 1597, to his son-in-law Charles de Crequy. Sincerely devoted to the throne, Lesdiguières took no part in the intrigues which disturbed the minority of Louis XIII, and he moderated the political claims made by his co-religionists under the terms of the Edict of Nantes. After the death of his first wife, Claudine de Berenger, he married the widow of Ennemond Matel, a Grenoble shopkeeper, who was murdered in 1617. Lesdiguières was then 73, and this lady, Marie Vignon, had long been his mistress. He had two daughters, one of whom, Françoise, married Charles de Crequy.\n\nIn 1622 he formally abjured the Protestant faith, his conversion being partly due to the influence of Marie Vignon. He was already a duke and peer of France; he now became constable of France, and received the Order of the Holy Spirit. He had long since lost the confidence of the Huguenots, but he nevertheless helped the Vaudois against the duke of Savoy. He led the Royal troops against the Huguenots in the Siege of Montpellier in 1622 and was key in finding a negotiated peace.\n\nLesdiguières had the qualities of a great general, but circumstances limited him to the mountain warfare of Dauphiné, Provence and Savoy. He had almost unvarying success through sixty years of fighting. His last campaign, fought in alliance with Savoy to drive the Spaniards from the Valtellina, was the least successful of his enterprises.\n\nHe died of fever at Valence on 21 September 1626.\n\n"}

{"id": "1807421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807421", "title": "Anne Lister", "text": "Anne Lister\n\nAnne Lister (3 April 1791 – 22 September 1840) was an English landowner and diarist from Halifax, West Yorkshire. Throughout her life, she kept diaries that chronicled the details of her daily life, including her lesbian relationships, her financial concerns, her industrial activities, and her work improving Shibden Hall. Her diaries contain 7,720 pages and more than 5 million words and about a sixth of them – those concerning the intimate details of her romantic and sexual relationships – were written in code. The code, derived from a combination of algebra and Ancient Greek, was deciphered in the 1930s. Lister is often called \"the first modern lesbian\" for her clear self-knowledge and openly lesbian lifestyle. Called \"Fred\" by her lover and \"Gentleman Jack\" by Halifax residents, she suffered harassment for her sexuality, but recognised her similarity to the Ladies of Llangollen, whom she visited.\n\nAnne Lister was the second child and eldest daughter of Jeremy Lister (1753–1836) who, as a young man in 1775, served with the British 10th Regiment of Foot in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in the American War of Independence. In August 1788, he married Rebecca Battle (1770–1817) of Welton in East Riding, Yorkshire. Their first child, John, was born in 1789 but died the same year. Anne Lister was born in Halifax on 3 April 1791. In 1793, the family moved to an estate named Skelfler House at Market Weighton. Skelfler was where young Anne spent her earliest years. A second son, Samuel, who was close to Anne, was born in 1793. The Listers had four sons and two daughters, but only Anne and her younger sister, Marian, survived past 20 years old.\n\nBetween 1801 and 1805, Lister was educated at home by the Reverend George Skelding, the vicar of Market Weighton, and at the age of seven, she was sent to a school run by a Mrs. Hagues and a Mrs. Chettle in Agnesgate, Ripon. On her visits to her aunt Anne and uncle James at Shibden Hall, the Misses Mellin gave her lessons. In 1804, Anne Lister was sent to the Manor House School in York (in the King's Manor buildings), where Anne met her first love, Eliza Raine (1793–1860). Eliza and her sister Jane were the very rich daughters of an East India Company surgeon in Madras, brought to Yorkshire after his death. Anne and Eliza met and shared a bedroom aged 13 at boarding school, but Anne was asked to leave after two years. She rejoined the school after Eliza had left. Eliza expected to live with Anne as an adult, but Anne began affairs with Isabella Norcliffe and Mariana Belcombe, day-pupils at the school. In despair and frustration, Eliza became a patient at Clifton Asylum, run by Mariana's father, Dr Belcombe. While being educated at home, Lister developed an interest in classical literature. In a surviving letter to her aunt from 3 February 1803, a young Lister explains \"My library is my greatest pleasure... The Grecian History had pleased me much.\"\n\nShe inherited Shibden Hall on her aunt's death in 1836, but took charge of it from 1826, and from it drew a reasonable income (some of it from tenants). Her wealth allowed her some measure of freedom to live as she pleased.\n\nIn addition to income from the agricultural tenancy, Lister's financial portfolio included properties in town, shares in the canal and railway industries, mining, and stone quarries. Lister used the income from this varied portfolio to finance her two passions, Shibden Hall and European travel.\n\nLister is described as having a \"masculine appearance\"; one of her lovers, Marianna Lawton (\"née\" Belcombe), was initially ashamed to be seen in public with her because her appearance was commented on. She dressed entirely in black and took part in many activities that were not perceived as the norm for women of the time, such as opening and owning a colliery. She was referred to as \"Gentleman Jack\" in some quarters. Lawton and Lister were lovers for several years, including a period during which Lawton was married and to which her husband became resigned.\n\nAlthough Lister had met her on various occasions in the 1820s, Ann Walker, who by 1832 had become a wealthy heiress, took on a much more substantial role in Lister's life. Eventually the women took communion together on Easter Sunday (30 March) 1834 in Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, and thereafter considered themselves married, but without legal recognition. The church has been described as \"an icon for what is interpreted as the site of the first lesbian marriage to be held in Britain\", and the building now hosts a commemorative blue plaque. The couple lived together at Shibden Hall until Lister's death in 1840.\n\nWalker's fortune was used to improve Shibden Hall and the property's waterfall and lake. Lister renovated Shibden Hall quite significantly to her own design. In 1838, she added a Gothic tower to the main house, to serve as her private library. She also had a tunnel dug under the building which allowed the staff to move about without disturbing her.\n\nThroughout her life, Lister had a strong Anglican faith and also remained a Tory, \"interested in defending the privileges of the land-owning aristocracy\".\n\nLister greatly enjoyed travel, although her biographer Angela Steidele suggests her trips in later life were also a way to \"evade the self realisation that she had failed at everything she set her hand to\". She made her first trip to continental Europe in 1819, when she was 28 years old. She travelled with her 54-year-old aunt, also called Anne Lister, on a two-month trip to France.\n\nIn 1824 she returned to Paris and stayed until the following year. In 1826 she was back in Paris with her Aunt Anne, where she resumed an affair from her earlier visit to the city with a widow named Maria Barlow. In 1827, she set out from Paris with both Maria Barlow and her Aunt Anne on a tour of northern Italy and Switzerland. Only in 1828 did she return to Shibden Hall.\n\nShe left for the continent once more in 1829. With Paris as her base, she visited Belgium and Germany before heading south to the Pyrenees. Here she did hiking as well as crossed the border into Spain. Whilst there she demonstrated both her strong adventurous streak and considerable physical fitness by ascending Monte Perdido (11,007 feet; 3,355 m), the third highest peak in the Pyrenees.\n\nReturning to Shibden Hall in 1831, she found life with her father Jeremy and sister Marian so uncomfortable that she almost immediately left again, visiting the Netherlands for a short trip with a friend, Mariana Lawton. All in all, between 1826 and 1832, she only spent a few weeks at Shibden Hall, with travels around Britain and Europe allowing her to avoid her family at home.\n\nIn 1834 she again visited France and Switzerland, this time for her honeymoon with Ann Walker. Returning with Ann in 1838, she again headed south to the Pyrenees and completed the first \"official\" ascent of the Vignemale (10,820 feet; 3,298 m), the highest peak in the French Pyrenees. This required a 10-hour hike to reach the top, and another 7 to descend. \n\nHer last and greatest trip began in 1839. Leaving Shibden Hall in June with Ann Walker and two servants, they travelled in their own carriage through France, Denmark, Sweden and Russia, arriving in St Petersburg in September and in Moscow in October. With a reluctant Ann Walker in tow, she left Moscow in February 1840 in a new Russian carriage and very warm clothing. They travelled south, along the frozen Volga river, to the Caucasus. Few West Europeans had visited this area, let alone West European women, in part because of unrest amongst the local population against the Tsarist regime. At times they needed a military escort. The two women were a source of great curiosity to the people they visited. As Anne noted in her diary, \"The people coming in to look at us as if we were some strange animals such as they had not seen the like before\".\n\nAnne Lister died on 22 September 1840, aged 49, of a fever at Koutais (now Kutaisi in Georgia) while travelling with Ann Walker. Walker had Lister's body embalmed and brought back to the UK, where she was buried in the parish church in Halifax, West Yorkshire, on 29 April 1841. Her tombstone was rediscovered in 2010, having been covered by a floor in 1879.\n\nIn her will, Lister's estate was left to her paternal cousins, but Ann Walker was given a life interest. After being declared insane, Walker spent some years in the care of Dr. Belcombe, and because of her mental state, was unable to make a valid will. She died in 1854 at her childhood home, Cliff Hill in Lightcliffe, West Yorkshire.\n\nMore than 40 years after her death, while reporting on a dispute over the ownership of Shibden Hall, the \"Leeds Times\" in 1882 stated, \"Miss Lister's masculine singularities of character are still remembered\".\n\nDuring her life, Anne wrote a four-million-word diary. It began in 1806 as scraps of paper, recording in secret code parcels sent to and from Eliza Raine, and eventually became the 26 Quarto volumes, ending at her death in 1840. In addition to her handwriting being incredibly difficult to decipher, around one-sixth of the diary is encrypted in a simple code Eliza and she had devised, combining the Greek alphabet, zodiac, punctuation, and mathematical symbols, and it describes in great detail her lesbian identity and affairs, as well as the methods she used for seduction. The diaries also contain her thoughts on the weather, social events, national events, and her business interests. The majority of her diary deals with her daily life, and not merely her sexuality, and provides detailed information on social, political, and economic events of the time.\n\nThe code used in her diaries was deciphered by the last inhabitant of Shibden Hall, John Lister (1847–1933) and a friend of his, Arthur Burrell. When the content of the secret passages was revealed, Burrell advised John Lister to burn all the diaries. Lister did not take this advice, but instead continued to hide Anne Lister's diaries behind a panel at Shibden Hall.\n\nIn 2011, Lister's diaries were added to the register of the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The register citation notes that, while a valuable account of the times, it was the \"comprehensive and painfully honest account of lesbian life and reflections on her nature, however, which have made these diaries unique. They have shaped and continue to shape the direction of UK Gender Studies and Women's History.\"\n\nLister's diaries have been described as part of a \"trilogy of early 19th century diaries\" by local women, covering the same period from different perspectives, along with those of Caroline Walker from 1812 to 1830, and Elizabeth Wadsworth from 1817 to 1829.\n\nHelena Whitbread published some of the diaries in two volumes (1988 and 1992). Their graphic nature meant at first they were believed by some to be a hoax, but documentary evidence has since established their authenticity. A biography by the academic Jill Liddington appeared in 1994. In 2014, a conference held at Shibden Hall focused on Lister's life along with gender and sexuality in the 19th century.\n\nA biography by Angela Steidele in the German language was published in 2017, and published in English in 2018.\n\nWork by Dorothy Thompson and Patricia Hughes in the late 1980s resulted in discovery of the first juvenile Lister diaries and decoding of the other two Lister codes. Hughes self-published \"Anne Lister's Secret Diary for 1817\" (2006) and \"The Early Life of Miss Anne Lister and the Curious Tale of Miss Eliza Raine\" (2010), both of which make extensive use of other materials in the Lister archives including letters, diaries, and ancillary documents.\n\nIn 1994, the first episode of the BBC Two series \"A Skirt Through History\" titled \"A Marriage\" featured Julia Ford as Anne Lister, and Sophie Thursfield as Marianna Belcombe.\n\nOn 31 May 2010, BBC Two broadcast a production based on Lister's life, \"The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister\", starring Maxine Peake as Lister. \"Revealing Anne Lister\", a documentary featuring Sue Perkins, was broadcast on the same night on BBC Two.\n\nIn 2012, on their second album, \"The Fragile\", chamber folk duo O'Hooley & Tidow (Belinda O'Hooley and Heidi Tidow) released a song about Anne Lister, which is called \"Gentleman Jack\".\n\nIn spring 2019 a BBC-HBO historical TV drama series, \"Gentleman Jack\", starring Suranne Jones as Lister, depicts her life as \"the first modern lesbian\". Penguin Books published a companion volume by the series' senior consultant, Anne Choma, which includes newly transcribed and decoded entries from Lister's diaries. The drama's end credits acknowledge that it was \"inspired by the books \"Female Fortune\" and \"Nature’s Domain\"” by Jill Liddington, who also acted as consultant and whose own website summarises Lister's extraordinary life as \"dazzling worldly achievements plus unbuttoned lesbian affairs\". O'Hooley & Tidow's \"Gentleman Jack\" serves as the series' primary theme music.\n\nIn 2018, a blue plaque with rainbow edging and wording \"Gender-nonconforming entrepreneur. Celebrated marital commitment, without legal recognition, to Ann Walker in this church. Easter, 1834\" was unveiled at Holy Trinity Church in York to honour her; it was York's first LGBT history plaque. The wording was criticised for not mentioning Lister's sexuality, and in 2019, it was replaced with a similar plaque with the wording \"Anne Lister 1791–1840 of Shibden Hall, Halifax / Lesbian and Diarist; took sacrament here to seal her union with Ann Walker / Easter 1834\".\n\n\n\n"}

The first known heraldic shaped coat of arms of the city appears in the sixteenth century and is probably of Hungarian origin. But like the history of the city itself, so did its coat of arms. As the city passed from hand to hand of the various invaders, so did its heraldic representation change - whether the city did not have its coat of arms as under the Ottomans at all, or that it got a whole new one under the Austrians.\n\nThe history of the coat of arms of Belgrade, which is in use today, began in 1931 when it was officially elected, following a competition that won the work of Đorđe Andrejević-Kun. In the socialist era, the coat of arms was neglected, and after the democratic changes of the 1990s it would undergo a re-affirmation, and since the 2000s it would be reorganized to three degrees, which is still in use today.\n\nThe use of the coat of arms of Belgrade is governed by the City Statute and special city regulations, which regulate and sanction the use of the coat of arms in various occasions and places in detail.\n\nThe original coat of arms was commissioned in 1931 by Belgrade mayor Milan Nešić. The winning proposal was sketched by Đorđe Andrejević-Kun. The arms remained in continued use until the conclusion of the Second World War. Between 1946 and 1991, it included a red star on top to symbolize communist rule. The use of the arms was amended and regulated in 2003.\n\nThe arms contain the Serbian national colours (red, blue, and white). The red ground symbolises blood split over the city during its many conflicts. The blue sky symbolizes hope and faith in a better future. The white walls and tower symbolise the \"white city\" (Belgrade – Beograd literally means \"the white city). The white rivers below represent the Danube and Sava and the primordial beginning of Belgrade while the Roman trireme refers to its antiquity. The open gates of the city represent free communication and commerce with the world.\n\nThe small (or lesser) coat of arms is the original design by Đorđe Andrejević-Kun. It features a simple escutcheon.\n\nBlazon of Basic Coat of Arms:\n\nThe middle (or medium) coat of arms is identical to the small, but with the addition of a golden mural crown placed above the escutcheon. The crown features five merlons, and a diadem with five gems (rubies, sapphires, emeralds). According to the standards of Serbian Heraldry Society, this wall crown with five indents belongs only to the capital city, and the diadem with jewels belongs to the historical capitals.\n\nThe greater coat of arms consists of a silver (white) bicephalic eagle, with gold talons and beak. The eagle is a symbol of the Serbian state, and is consistent with the national coat of arms of Serbia. On the eagle's chest are the coat of arms of Belgrade, which emphasis the status of capital, and above the eagle's heads is the wall crown of the medium coat of arms. Underneath the eagle are two oak branches, which represent civic virtues, and over the point where they cross is the first known coat of arms of Belgrade, which represents the heraldic history of the city. The sword and the olive branch on the large coat of arms represent readiness to fight in war, and to cooperate in peace. Over the oak branches are decorations given to Belgrade, in their natural colours, and with appropriate ribbons. They stand for the glorious past and merits of the citizens of Belgrade. The medals are:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807449", "title": "Eloisa to Abelard", "text": "Eloisa to Abelard\n\nEloisa to Abelard is a verse epistle by Alexander Pope that was published in 1717 and based on a well-known Mediaeval story. Itself an imitation of a Latin poetic genre, its immediate fame resulted in a large number of English imitations throughout the rest of the century and other poems more loosely based on its themes thereafter. Translations of varying levels of faithfulness appeared across Europe, starting in the 1750s and reaching a peak towards the end of the 18th century and the start of the 19th. These were in the vanguard of the shift away from Classicism and towards the primacy given emotion over reason that heralded Romanticism. Artistic depictions of the poem's themes were often reproduced as prints illustrating the poem; there were also paintings in France of the women readers of the amorous correspondence between the lovers.\n\nPope's poem was published in 1717 in a small volume titled \"The Works of Mr Alexander Pope\". There were two other accompanying poems, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the original version of the \"Ode on St Cecilia's Day\". Such was the poem's popularity that it was reissued in 1720 along with the retitled \"Verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady'\" and several other elegiac poems by different authors.\n\n\"Eloisa to Abelard\" is an Ovidian heroic epistle of which Pope had earlier published an example translated from the Latin in 1714, “Sappho to Phaon”. His own original exercise in this genre was inspired by the 12th-century story of Héloïse d'Argenteuil's illicit love for, and secret marriage to, her teacher Peter Abelard, a famous Parisian philosopher some twenty years her senior. After their affair and marriage, her family took brutal vengeance on Abelard and castrated him, following which he entered a monastery and compelled Héloïse to become a nun. Both then led comparatively successful monastic careers. Years later, Abelard completed the \"Historia Calamitatum\" (History of misfortunes), cast as a letter of consolation to a friend. When it fell into Heloise's hands, her passion for him was reawakened and there was an exchange of four letters between them written in an ornate Latin style. In an effort to make sense of their personal tragedy, these explored the nature of human and divine love. However, their incompatible male and female perspectives made the dialogue painful for both.\n\nIn Pope's poem, Eloisa confesses to the suppressed love that his letter has reawakened. She recalls their former life together and its violent aftermath, comparing the happy state of \"the blameless Vestal\" with her own reliving of past passion and sorrow. The memory of it turns the landscape gloomy \"and breathes a browner horror on the woods\" (line 170). It disturbs the performance of her religious offices, where Abelard's image \"steals between my God and me\" (line 267). But, since relations between them are now impossible, she advises him to distance himself from her memory and looks forward to the release of death when \"one kind grave\" will reunite them (line 343).\n\nPope was born a Roman Catholic and so might be assumed to have an insight into, and a special interest in, the story. He had, however, a recently published source to inspire him and guide his readers. This was \"The Letters of Abelard and Heloise: with a particular account of their lives, amours, and misfortune\" by the poet John Hughes, which was first published in 1713 and was to go through many editions in the following century and more. There are several instances of Pope's direct dependence on Hughes’ version of the letters. As one example, where Heloise exclaims \"Among those who are wedded to God I serve a man; among the heroic supporters of the cross I am a poor slave to a human passion; at the head of a religious community I am devoted to Abelard only\", Pope's Eloisa condenses this to the lines\nThe final lines of Pope's poem almost seem to invite a response from others:\nWhether this was deliberate or not, some seventeen imitations and parodies of his poem had been written by the end of the century, all but two of them cast as Abelard's reply to Eloisa and written in heroic couplets. Although Pope's poem provided the main inspiration, and was frequently mentioned by the authors in their prefaces, there was always Hughes' volume with its historical account in the background. In its later editions the dependency between the two was further underlined by the inclusion first of Pope's poem (from 1755) and then some of the principal responses in following editions.\n\nThe poems in question are as follows:\n\n\nOver and above such direct imitations, Pope's poem inspired heroic epistles between other couples. Charles Augustine Lea declared on the title page that his “Eliza to Comus, an epistle” (1753) was written as an imitation. Noting its excess of redundant verbiage as compared to Pope's concise style, however, the \"Monthly Review\" chided the author for his indiscreet comparison. The later \"Poetic epistles of Chrysostom and Marcella\" (Dublin 1777) likewise described itself as “dedicated to the memory of Abelard and Eloisa”. Then in 1785 the fourth edition of Thomas Warwick's imitation was accompanied by two other epistles, “Leonora to Tasso” and “Ovid to Julia”.\n\nThe genre was to be broadened by two more imitations whose humorous success brought them frequent reprinting. The first was Richard Owen Cambridge's clever \"Elegy Written in an Empty Assembly-Room\" (1756). Although its preface describes the poem as \"being a Parody on the most remarkable Passages in the well-known Epistle of \"Eloisa to Abelard\"\", its title also places it among the contemporary parodies of Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" whose object was to give them an unlikely setting. Imitation of lines from Pope's epistle in this context adds a new level of subtlety.\n\nA later work, \"Eloisa en deshabille, being a new version of that lady's celebrated epistle to Abelard\" (1780), was described at the time as \"a profligate parody of Mr Pope's Epistle\". In this a burlesque and witty version matched Pope's original line for line and in later editions appeared opposite his poem. It was written in anapaestic measure with frequent disyllabic and trisyllabic rhymes, of which one of the most notorious was\nThe poem has been ascribed to several authors, of whom Richard Porson was once considered the most likely, although a strong case has also been made for John Matthews.\n\nWhere the parodies made fun of the passages they aped, the epistolary imitations echoed Pope's themes and language in order to demonstrate their kinship. Thus Richard Barford ends his poem with a similar sentiment to Pope's, that true lovers will express their kinship with Eloisa and Abelard in similar words:\nAnd the third and fourth lines of St-John Seymour's opening, \"If cold my blood, my pulse inactive grown,/ I am indeed allied to lifeless stone\", is heavily dependent on Pope's \"Tho' cold like you, unmov'd, and silent grown,/ I have not yet forgot my self to stone.\" (lines 23-24)\n\nSamuel Birch compares the felicity of the blameless youth to the jealous perturbation of one who has experienced passion. And, as Eloisa had experienced \"twilight groves and dusky caves\", so Barford's Abelard reports\nJames Cawthorne too speaks of \"dark, cheerless solitary caves, deep breathing woods and daily-op’ning graves\" (which also figure in Pope) subject to \"imbrowning glooms\" (p. 143). Then, as a final example, Pope's passage beginning \"Thy voice I seem in ev’ry hymn to hear\" (line 269), in which the progress of the religious service is invaded by thoughts of the loved object, has its parallel in Edward Jerningham's similar description of sacred rites, from which \"My guilty thoughts to other altars rov’d\" (page 4).\n\nImitation in these cases, as one commentator points out, is far from being plagiarism, but is a valid constituent of the genre. Furthermore, \"since an author of an \"Abelard to Eloisa\" would presuppose for his readers a thorough knowledge of Pope's poem, the many replies are evidence of the popularity of \"Eloisa to Abelard\" and are evidence, also, of its importance as a literary force.\"\n\nOne of the reasons for the continued popularity of Eloisa to Abelard was the fact that emotion there was given primacy over reason in a way that heralds later literary trends. The poem, one critic comments, \"makes Pope one of the forerunners of the Romanticists\". As these trends developed in Europe, translations of Pope's poem were to lead the vanguard.\nAmorous melancholy had already been identified as a variety of that emotion by Robert Burton a century before Pope's poem. Melancholy is mentioned in its third line and recurs later, suitably inspired by a Gothic landscape of gloomy forest, overhanging crags, tottering aisles and ancient tombs. It is equally the sentiment emphasised in George Pinto's 'canzonet' near the start of the 19th century, which is a setting of the passage beginning \"Soon as the letters trembling I unclose, That well-known name awakens all my woes\" (lines 29-48), with its repeated references to tears and sighs. \nTears at the prospect of parting from the loved one are equally the subject of two English paintings inspired by the poem. Angelica Kauffmann's \"The Farewell of Abelard and Héloïse\" (1780) pictures an absurdly young Abelard in Renaissance dress clinging to Eloisa's hand as the nuns welcome her at the door of the convent. In Joseph Severn's \"Scene from Pope's Eloisa to Abelard\", Eloisa is already in the nun's habit and looks back with regret at her kneeling lover as she is led into the cloister; the steps behind her are littered with rose petals from the ceremony that has made her just now the ‘spouse of God’. Though the poem is an epistle, it contains narrative memories and the passage portrayed in these cases is\n\nJohn Opie’s “Eloisa, a nun”, a print of which appeared in 1793, only connects with the poem at a tangent. It features a nun rapt in contemplation, her face lit by the grated window above, who is sitting at a table on which are a bible, rosary, skull and hourglass. It was Mary Linwood who identified her embroidered version with the passage from Pope's poem beginning “How happy is the blameless vestal’s lot” when it was exhibited in London at the start of the 19th century. In the poem itself, Eloisa specifically distances her own conduct from this blameless spectacle.\n\nBy contrast, some French paintings deriving from the poem feature erotic rather than spiritual rapture as their theme. One of the most notorious, Bernard d'Agesci's \"Lady Reading the Letters of Heloise and Abelard\" (see above), is contemporary with Kaufmann's tearful scene. In it a young lady in décolletage looks up from her reading with head thrown back and pupils rolling upward. The book slipping from her grasp may well be a translation of Pope's poem, or even one of those compilations which gathered together imitations so as to form an extended correspondence between the lovers. While the emotion portrayed in Charles Gleyre's \"Héloise\" is not so extreme, her seated position and upward glance have more in common with d’Agesci's than with Opie's figure. Furthermore, a print of the painting was later used to illustrate the line \"What means this tumult in a Vestal's veins\" in an 1892 edition of the poem, carrying the same message of erotic rapture.\n\nThough the Eloisa of Pope's poem is a more nuanced character, her interpretation will depend on other factors operating at the time of her portrayal. One will be the impression left by secondary literature and particularly by studies based on more authentic documents than those which Pope himself had consulted. Another, and a strong one, will be the mediation of the very free translations of his poem in the countries to which it travelled.\n\nThe languages into which “Eloisa to Abelard” was translated included French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Danish, Swedish, Polish, Russian and Latin.\n\nVersions in the last of these, it is true, were hardly consequential. The future Rev. George Wakefield made one as an undergraduate exercise near the start of the 1740s. A specimen translation of several of Pope's works, including this epistle, was put forward as a proposal in 1747; then, having gained subscribers, Dr James Kirkpatrick published the whole two years later. J. Wright's \"Epistola Eloisae Aberlardo\" followed in 1787 but was dismissed as a waste of effort in the \"Monthly Review\". The original letters on which Pope's poem was loosely based had been written in Latin of a high order in the first place. Turning it back into Latin (except as an academic exercise, according to the \"Monthly Review\") was a self-defeating exercise.\n\nIn Europe there was a translation by Johann Joachim Gottlob am Ende (1704–77), several editions of which were published in Germany from 1742 onwards. But when it was sent to Pope himself by the author, he found it inelegant though faithful. In the following century a closer version in hexameters was published by the German Latinist Georg Ludwig Spalding (Berlin 1804). In Italy, meanwhile, Vincenzo Forlani's Latin version in elegiac couplets had accompanied a very free imitation of Pope's poem by Antonio Schinella Conti (Lucca 1792). This, however, was based on Conti's text rather than translated directly from the English.\n\nSince they were of French origin, interest in the story of Eloise and Abelard there predated that in Britain. An account of their “life, love, misfortunes” and a translation of their letters from the Latin by Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy was published in 1687 and frequently reprinted, becoming the major source for subsequent literary reworkings. It served, for example, as groundwork for Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps’ three verse epistles exchanged between the former lovers in \"Les Lettres d’Héloise et d’Abailard mis en vers François\" (1714). Hughes had only published his English versions of the original letters in 1713, followed by Pope’s epistle in 1717.\nFrench translations of “The Rape of the Lock” began in the 1750s, stimulated by the complete edition of Pope's work of 1751. The first was a prose version by Anne-Marie du Boccage (Berlin 1751); it was followed in 1757 by Gabriel-François Coyer's (1707-1782); by the Duchesse d’Aiguillon (1700–72), published from Geneva in 1758; and in the December 1773 issue of the \"Mercure de France\" by Dattin de Chartres. In verse the pioneering work was a very free version by Charles-Pierre Colardeau (Paris 1756).) More an adaptation in s, it retained its popularity over the following decades “despite its high-flown language and impersonal tone, its languor, its elegant circumlocutions and conventional epithets”. Its success, according to a later preface, “brought to birth a torrent of little poems under the title Heroides, Epistle, Letter, most of them forgotten by now”; indeed, Colardeau was to contribute to the flow with his own \"Armide à Renaud: Héroide\" (Paris 1759). But enough of those solely dedicated to Eloisa and Abelard remained to furnish omnibus collections of what purported to be their long correspondence.\nThese subsequent compilations, taking Ovid's Double Heroides as their model, consist of strings of paired letters furnished by diverse authors that serve as context for translations of Pope's poem not only by Colardeau but subsequent versions as well. They include \"Lettres et épîtres amoureuses d'Héloïse, avec les réponses d'Abeilard, traduites librement en vers et en prose\" (Paris 1770), of which there was an augmented London edition in 1780. The first volume of this contained a biographical essay and Latin-based versions of the letters, followed in the second by a dialogue between translations of Pope and of French imitations. Contained there among other inclusions, Colardeau's version of Pope is paired with one of the earlier verse epistles in Abelard's name by De Beauchamps. A closer translation of Pope's poem by Aimé Ambroise Joseph Feutry (1720–89), first published in 1758, is replied to by Claude Joseph Dorat’s 1760 imitation, \"Epître d’Abeilard à Héloïs\". Louis-Sébastien Mercier’s ‘imitation’ of Pope's epistle (published in 1763) is followed by a later revised reply by Dorat dating from 1767. The succeeding \"Épitre d’Héloïse à son Époux\", an imitation of Eloisa's response to the \"Historia Calamitatum\", devised by Sébastien Marie Mathurin Gazon-Dourxigné (1720–84) but dependent on Pope for its occasion and Gothic setting, is followed by a reply by André-Charles Cailleau. Bernard-Joseph Saurin’s 1765 ‘imitation’ of Pope appears without reply but has as companion piece scenes from a play based on the story. Other earlier works uncollected there include a response from Abelard by Henri Lambert d’Herbigny, Marquis de Thibouville (1710–84), published in Paris in 1758, and translated versions of Pope such as that of 1767 by Édouard Thomas Simon (1740-1818) and that of 1771 by Maximilien Henri, Marquis de Saint-Simon (1720–99).\nTranslations into other Romance languages came much later than in France and demonstrate at times a dependence on the French example. In Spain, at least, there was resistance from the ecclesiastical establishment, where treatment of the theme was condemned by the neo-classical Jesuit Juan Andrés for its wild, pre-romantic imagery and for its blasphemous exhibition of love between those in holy orders. Once books began to appear from the press, the Inquisition stepped in and banned them. These included Juan Maria Maury’s translation into ottava rima (Malaga 1792) and a very free adaptation of Colardeau’s already free French version, \"Cartas de Abelardo y Eloisa\" (Salamanca 1796), together with a reply from Abelard of the translator’s own invention. The works are now ascribed to Vicente Maria Santibañez and were reprinted in the 19th century in the kind of omnibus editions using the double Heroides format that were still being reprinted in France.\nThe earliest Portuguese translations to appear were the \"Carta de Heloize a Abailardo\" (Porto 1785), followed by \"Epistola de Heloyza a Abaylard: composta no idioma inglez por Pope e trasladada em versos portuguezes\" (London 1801), a version in nine-syllable verse which has been credited to José Nicolau de Massuelos Pinto. Many more followed in the first half of the 19th century and are increasingly mediated through the French imitators of Pope.\n\nThe first imitation in Italian was Antonio Schinella Conti’s \"Elisa ad Abelardo: Epistola\", a very free piece in terza rima beginning “\"Abelardo, Abelardo! O quanto amore\"”, which was frequently anthologised. The 1792 Lucca edition of the poem also incorporated Vincenzo Forlani’s version in Latin elegaics on opposite pages. Thereafter, as in France, Conti’s poem was incorporated into a frequently reissued life and letters edition, where it was accompanied by Pope’s poem in English and Colardeau’s in French. Other versions were published soon after: in 1804 by Creofilio Smintéo, beginning “\"In queste solitudini profonde\"”, and in 1814 by G.B. Boschini, beginning “\"In queste oscure e solitarie celle\"”.\n\nAt first French mediation of the poem was dominant in Germany via collections of Pope’s works that, though published from German presses, were translated directly into French. Among these was included the 1751 prose rendering by Anne-Marie du Boccage already mentioned. The first German-language \"Brief der Eloise an den Abelard\", published anonymously in 1760, was in fact based on Colardeau’s translation, the French text of which appeared opposite the German alexandrines. Several more translations from the original English followed, though they were of varying quality. Between 1779-1804 no less than ten appeared in both verse and prose. Two of the most prominent, by Gottfried August Bürger and Johann Joachim Eschenburg, were frequently published, in some cases together, both from German and from Austrian presses. Burger’s \"Heloise an Abelard\", more an improvisation than a translation, was followed in its Swiss edition (Zurich 1803) by Pope’s original; from the same press in 1804 appeared J. Rothstein’s free prose version, accompanied by Colardeau’s French translation and Pope’s poem as well.\nIn Russia Pope’s “Eloisa to Abelard” appealed to the literary Sentimentalism that served as a prelude to Romanticism. The first translation was \"Epistola Eloizy ko Abelardu\", tentatively ascribed to Mikhail Kheraskov, which was published five times between 1765-91. The next, the 1794 \"Éloiza k Abelardu\" by Vladislav Ozerov, was in fact a translation of Colardeau's work. Likewise, Vasily Zhukovsky‘s version of 1806, produced at the height of interest in the theme, also drew its main inspiration from France. “No other literary work was more popular, in Russia as in France, than the epistle of Eloisa to Abelard. [His translation] was very free, in the French fashion, by which it was quite possibly inspired.\"\n\nThe connection of the Polish \"Listy Heloizy i Abeilarda\" (Kraków 1794) with Alexander Pope was at a distant remove. The work of Stefan Chomentowski and Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski (1756-1787), it consists of versions of Colardeau's reworking of Eloisa's epistle to Abelard and of his reply as imagined by Dorat. The choice of French models, and the fact that the book appeared while the Polish state was in the final throes of the partition crisis, is referable to the politics of national renewal instituted as part of the Polish Enlightenment.\n\nOn the other side of the Baltic, Scandinavian translations began with Göran Rothman’s \"Eloisas bref til Abelard\" (Stockholm, 1765), to be followed in Sweden by the translations of Pehr af Lund (Stockholm, 1782), Joachim Wilhelm Liliestråle (Uppsala, 1782) and the anonymous and much freer Eloisa till Abelard (Uppsala 1822). There was no Danish version until the start of the 19th century, when Steen Steensen Blicher published his \"Elegie til Abailard efter Pope\" in the journal \"Tilskuer\" in 1817.\n\nThe more popular English treatments of the Eloisa and Abelard story, particularly the poems by Pope and Cawthorn, continued to be reprinted in the opening decades of the 19th century, bringing fresh imitations in their wake. They began with John Gwilliam's “Paraclete, or the Sorrows of Abelard and Heloise”, a long epistle from Heloise in couplets that appeared first in \"The Mourning Wreath\" (London 1813) and was reprinted next year in \"The Bower of Bliss\". Of two later reworkings, J. Treuwhard's \"Abelard to Eloisa, a moral and sentimental epistle\", was privately printed in 1830. The \"Epistle from Abelard to Eloise\", originally published in 1828 by Thomas Stewart (of Naples), was in heroic couplets and prefaced by a poem to Pope.\n\nThe Hughes letters, along with Pope's poem and a selection of imitations, were now beginning to be reprinted in the United States too and also brought poetic responses in their train. That by Joseph Rodman Drake, written before 1820, is a short lyric in octosyllabics with the message that shared suffering will lead to shared redemption beyond the grave. Though it carries the title \"Abelard to Eloise\" in a holographic copy, it was also published without it after his death. John Witt Randall's \"Abelard and Eloisa\", published in 1856, is a sequence of six poems, written in various forms and fashioned more as poetical addresses than letters. They follow the story of the lovers from courtship to death, and sections 2, 3 and 6 are spoken by Eloisa.\n\nTwo women also took up the subject later. Christina Rossetti's \"The Convent Threshold\" (written in 1858) is, according to one source, \"a thinly disguised retelling of Alexander Pope's Eloisa to Abelard\", although others are more cautious in seeing an influence. The poem is a surging monologue of enlaced rhymes in octosyllables, driving along its theme of leaving earthly passion behind and transmuting it to heavenly love. It is also a rare example of a woman being allowed her own voice without male intervention. The Australian writer Gwen Harwood went on to use the situation as a weapon in the gender war. Writing under the assumed name of Walter Lehmann in 1961, she placed two modernistic sonnets, \"Eloisa to Abelard\" and \"Abelard to Eloisa\", in a magazine without its male editors realising that the letters of their first lines spelt an offensive message.\n\n\n"}

What this means is that it is the righthand element that provides the primary syntactic and/or semantic information. The projection of syntactic information from the righthand element onto the output word is known as feature percolation. The righthand head rule is considered a broadly general and universal principle of morphology. In certain other languages it is proposed that rather than a righthand head rule, a lefthand head rule applies, where the lefthand element provides this information.\n\nIn derivational morphology (i.e. the creation of new words), the head is that morpheme that provides the part of speech (PoS) information. According to the righthand head rule, this is of course the righthand element.\n\nFor instance, the word 'person' is a noun, but if the suffix '-al' were added then 'personal' is derived. 'Personal' is an adjective, and the righthand head rule holds that the PoS information is provided by the suffix '-al', which is the righthand element.\n\nThe adverb 'personally' is derived from 'personal' by adding the suffix '-ly'. The PoS-information is provided by this suffix which is added to the right of 'personal'.\n\nThe same applies to the noun 'personality', which is also derived from 'personal', this time by adding the nominal suffix '-ity' to the right of the input word. Again the PoS-information is projected from the righthand element.\n\nThe three above examples may be formalized thus (N=noun, ADJ=adjective, ADV=adverb):\n\n\nThey are all instances of the righthand head rule, which may be formalized as:\n\n\nThe righthand head rule may also be applied to inflectional morphology (i.e. the addition of semantic information without changing the word class). In relation to inflectional morphology, the righthand head rule holds that the rightmost element of a word provides the most essential additional semantic information.\n\nFor example, the past tense form of 'play' is created by adding the past tense suffix '-(e)d' to the right. This suffix provides the past tense feature which is also the main additional semantic content of the output word 'played'.\n\nLikewise, the plural form of 'dog' is created by the addition of the plural nominal suffix '-s' to the right of the input. Thus 'dogs' inherits its plurality feature from the suffix.\n\nThe same thing goes for the comparative form of the adjective 'ugly'. 'Uglier' is created by the addition of the comparative suffix '-er' to the right, thus receiving its comparative feature from the suffix.\n\nFormalizing the examples shows that the underlying principle of inflection is basically the same as the righthand head rule (INF=infinitive, P=past tense, SG=singular, POS=positive, COM=comparative):\n\n\nAnother area of morphology where the righthand head rule seems applicable is that of compounding (i.e. the creation of a word by combining two or more other words), in which it holds that the righthand word provides both the essential semantic information and the word class.\n\nFor instance, the noun 'runway' combines a verb and a noun. Since it refers to a kind of way rather than a kind of running, and since it is a noun and not a verb, the head is 'way', which appears on the right.\n\nThe noun 'wheelchair' combines two nouns. The primary element is the righthand one - namely, 'chair' - since the word refers to a kind of chair rather than a kind of wheel.\n\nAgain formalizations show that the underlying principle must be the righthand head rule:\n\n\nThe righthand head rule is taken to be a universal principle of morphology, but has been subject to much severe criticism. The main point of criticism is that it is empirically insufficient because it ignores numerous cases where the head does not appear in the righthand position (PREP=preposition, NEG=negation):\n\n\nAnother main point of criticism is that the righthand head rule is too Eurocentric, or even Anglocentric, taking into consideration only morphological processes typical of European languages (mainly English) and ignoring processes from languages all over the world. Certainly in certain languages a lefthand head rule applies rather than a righthand head rule.\n\nMany linguists reject the righthand head rule as being too idealizing and empirically inadequate.\n"}

The defenders, greatly outnumbered, fought stubbornly\n\nbefore being overwhelmed; nevertheless, the fall of Wissembourg allowed the Prussian army to move into France and compelled Marshal Mac-Mahon to give battle, and suffer defeat, at the Battle of Wörth on 6 August.\n\nIn June 1870 Napoleon III had moved the French army into Lorraine and occupied Saarbrücken. Napoleon wished to win a significant battle on German soil and ordered Marshal Patrice Mac-Mahon to bring up the French I and V Corps. Mac-Mahon's objective was to reach Wissembourg where he already had one division stationed under General Abel Douay. Once there he would concentrate his forces for a strike into Germany. The German III Army under Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm and his able Chief of Staff, General von Blumenthal, was already moving towards Wissembourg. Neither side was fully aware of the other's movements.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, General Ducrot, commanding the 6th French Division at Strasbourg, issued orders to withdraw the elements of his forces stationed at Wissembourg and Lauterbourg. The sub-prefect of Wissembourg protested this decision, not sharing Ducrot's doubts on the wisdom of diluting the 6th division along the German frontier. General Douay's 2nd French Division set off for Haguenau 22 July, making it necessary to reoccupy Wissembourg to secure Douay's line of supply, a portion of his materiel being stored in the small frontier town.\n\nIn August, Marshal Mac-Mahon concentrated his effectives at Haguenau with the object of warding off any attempt on the strategic Strasbourg—Haguenau—Bitche—Metz rail lines, and established the following positions: Ducrot's 1st Division broke camp on 4 August and established itself at Lembach in order to secure contact with General Failly's V Corps; Douay's 2nd Division reoccupied Wissembourg, Weiler and the nearby countryside, namely the soft hills by the \"Col du Pigeonnier\". The 1st Cavalry Brigade would patrol the frontier east of Wissembourg up to Schleithal.\nDucrot's familiarity with the terrain earned him the responsibility of overseeing the deployment of the various units in the area, including Douay's 1st Division. Accordingly, he instructed Douay to rearrange his with an emphasis on securing the heights commanding the valley of the Lauter: the main emplacements were set up on the Geisberg plateau to the east and the Vogelsberg plateau on the western side, leaving a single battalion in the town of Wissembourg proper. Finally, Douay was to relieve the 96th infantry regiment in the village of Climbach. At this point Ducrot received gravely flawed intelligence:\n\nUpon learning from captured Prussian soldiers and a local area police chief, that the Prussian Crown Prince's Third Army was just from Saarbrücken near the town of Wissembourg, General Le Bœuf and Napoleon III decided to retreat to defensive positions. General Frossard, without instructions, hastily withdrew the elements of Army of the Rhine in Saarbrücken back to Spicheren and Forbach.\n\nMarshal MacMahon, now closest to Wissembourg, spread his four divisions over to react to any Prussian invasion. This organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies, forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them. What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot, commander of the 1st Division. He told General Abel Douay, commander of the 2nd Division, on 1 August that\n\nTwo days later, he told MacMahon that he had not found\n\nThe effectiveness of French Chassepot rifle-fire inflicted costly repulses on infantry attacks, until the French infantry had been extensively bombarded by the Prussian artillery.\n\nThe battle saw the unsupported division of General Douay of I Corps, with some attached cavalry, which was posted to watch the border, attacked in overwhelming but un-coordinated fashion by the German 3rd Army. During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it. Douay was killed in the late morning when a caisson of the divisional mitrailleuse battery exploded near him; the encirclement of the town by the Prussians threatened the French avenue of retreat.\n\nThe fighting within the town had become extremely intense, becoming a door to door battle of survival. Despite a never-ending attack of Prussian infantry, the soldiers of the 2nd Division kept to their positions. The people of the town of Wissembourg finally surrendered to the Germans. The French troops who did not surrender retreated westward, leaving behind and wounded and another and all of their remaining ammunition. The final attack by the Prussian troops also cost The German cavalry then failed to pursue the French and lost touch with them. The attackers had an initial superiority of numbers, a broad deployment which made envelopment highly likely but the effectiveness of French Chassepot rifle-fire inflicted costly repulses on infantry attacks, until the French infantry had been extensively bombarded by the Prussian artillery.\n\nThe battle was a victory for the Germans and allowed them to invade France. Shortly after the battle the German III Army was on the move towards Wörth where they ran into the main body of MacMahon's army.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807483", "title": "Isabella, Queen of Armenia", "text": "Isabella, Queen of Armenia\n\nIsabella (), also Isabel ( 27 January 1216/ 25 January 1217 – 23 January 1252) was queen regnant of Armenian Cilicia from 1219 until her death.\n\nShe was proclaimed queen under the regency of Adam of Baghras. But he was assassinated; and Constantine of Baberon (of the Hethumian family) was nominated as guardian. At this juncture, Raymond-Roupen, grandson of Roupen III (the elder brother of Isabella’s father, King Leo I) set up a claim to the throne of Cilicia; but he was defeated, captured, and executed.\n\nConstantine of Barbaron was soon convinced to seek an alliance with Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch, and he arranged a marriage between the young princess and Philip, a son of Bohemond IV. Philip, however, offended the Armenians’ sensibilities, and even despoiled the royal palace, sending the royal crown to Antioch; therefore, he was confined in a prison in Sis (now \"Kozan\" in Turkey), where he died, presumably poisoned.\n\nThe unhappy young Isabella was forced to marry Constantine of Barbaron’s son, Hethum; although for many years she refused to live with him, but in the end she relented. The apparent unification in marriage of the two principal dynastic forces of Cilicia (\"i.e.\", the Roupenids and the Hethumids) ended a century of dynastic and territorial rivalry and brought the Hethumids to the forefront of political dominance in Cilician Armenia.\n\nIsabella was the only child of King Leo I by his second wife, Sybilla of Cyprus. She was betrothed to Andrew, the third son of King Andrew II of Hungary in 1218, but the betrothal was later broken in favor of a more advantageous Russian marriage for her bridegroom.\n\nKing Leo I died on May, 1219. On his death-bed, he named Isabella as his heir; and released the barons from their oath of allegiance to his great-nephew, Raymond-Roupen. But the claim of his five-year-old daughter was contested by Raymond-Roupen and by John of Brienne.\n\nIsabella emerged as the favourite of the ruling Armenian nobles and thus she was proclaimed queen by acclamation and placed under the regency of Adam of Baghras. But Adam of Baghras was murdered after a few months; and the regency passed to the only remaining influential Armenian house, that of the Hethumian family whose head was Constantine of Barbaron.\n\nJohn of Brienne’s claim was based on his marriage to Leo I’s older daughter Rita (Stephanie). Pope Honorius III recognized John of Brienne’s claim that his wife or her son should succeed. John of Brienne received the Pope’s permission to leave the Crusade and visit Cilician Armenia in February, 1220. But as he prepared to sail for Cilicia his Armenian wife died; and when their small son died a few weeks later, John of Brienne had no further claim on the Armenian throne.\n\nRaymond-Roupen laid claim to the throne by virtue of lineage through his mother Alice, the niece of King Leo I. Moreover, he had long been considered as King Leo I’s heir. Raymond-Roupen approached the crusaders at Damietta in 1219 for support in claiming Cilician Armenia, and was able to return in 1221 with some of them and promises from the Papal legate Pelagius. Raymond-Roupen found some Armenian support in and around Tarsus, notably Vahram, the castellan of Corycus. Together they conquered from Tarsus to Adana, but then met reverses and were forced to retire to Tarsus where Raymond-Roupen was captured and ended his days in prison in 1222; his infant daughters retired with their mother to Cyprus. This event left Isabella the sole and largely incontestable heir to her father’s throne.\n\nCilician Armenia, weakened by wars and in need of strong ally, found a temporary solution in a tie with the Principality of Antioch: the regent suggested that Prince Bohemond IV should send his fourth son, Philip, to marry Isabella, insisting only that the bridegroom should join the separated Armenian Church. Philip agreed to adopt the Armenian faith, communion and customs and to respect the privileges of all nations in Cilician Armenia.\n\nPhilip married Isabella at Sis in June 1222 and was accepted as king. The joint rule of Isabella and Philip was brief; Philip’s disdain for the Armenian ritual, which he had promised to respect, and his marked favoritism to the Latin barons angered the Armenian nobility. Philip spent as much time as possible in Antioch.\n\nWhen it was rumored that Philip wanted to give the crown and throne to Antioch, Constantine of Barbaron led a revolt at the end of 1224. Philip and Isabella were seized at Tall Hamdun (today \"Toprakkale\" in Turkey) on their way to Antioch and taken back to Sis, where Philip was imprisoned and probably poisoned at the beginning of 1225.\n\nOn the death of her husband, Isabella decided to embrace monastic life and fled to Silifke Castle. She sought refuge with the Hospitallers. The latter were unwilling to give her up to Constantine of Barbaron, but feared the powerful regent; they eased their conscience by selling him the fortress with Isabella in it.\n\nBohemond IV, in anger, was determined on war, although such a conflict had been expressly forbidden by the pope as harmful for all Christendom. Bohemond IV called in as ally the sultan at Iconium, Kai-Qobad I, and ravaged upper Cilicia in 1225. Constantine of Barbaron arranged for the regent of Aleppo, Toghril, to advance on Antioch. When the latter attacked Baghras, Bohemond IV had to return to his own lands.\n\nIsabella was forced into marriage with Constantine of Barbaron’s son who was subsequently crowned King Hetum I in Tarsus in June 1226. She is said to have refused to consummate the marriage for several years.\n\nConstantine of Barbaron now thought it wise to reconcile Armenia with the Papacy: loyal messengers were sent in the name of the young couple to the Pope and to the Emperor Frederick II. Although Bohemond IV and later his son, Bohemond V attempted to persuade the Pope to arrange a divorce between Isabella and Hethum, but both he and King Henry I of Cyprus were specifically forbidden by Rome to attack the Armenians. The marriage was legalized by Rome in 1237.\n\nThere is evidence that Isabella shared a degree of royal power, for we learn from several sources that she co-signed with her husband an official deed transferring to the Knights of the Teutonic Order the strategic castle and town of \"Haronie\".\nShe was buried in the monastery of Trazarg.\n\n\n\n"}

WABE's format features mostly news/Talk programming. It carries the NPR flagship programs \"Morning Edition\" and \"All Things Considered\", with locally produced \"City Lights\" hosted by Lois Reitzes and \"Closer Look\" hosted by Rose Scott.\n\nThe station is licensed to the Atlanta Board of Education (hence the \"ABE\" in the broadcast callsign). In September 1994, a nonprofit corporation, the Atlanta Educational Telecommunications Collaborative, Inc., was founded to provide financial, promotional, and volunteer support for WABE (as well as WPBA-TV and Atlanta Public Schools cable channel 22). WABE's signal reaches practically all of the northwestern and north-central parts of the state. It is the dominant public radio station in metropolitan Atlanta, but starting on June 30, 2014, has been joined during the daytime by Georgia Public Broadcasting Atlanta on 88.5 WRAS-FM. GPB provides public radio programming to most of the rest of the state.\n\nWABE also broadcasts the Georgia Radio Reading Service and Vietnam Public Radio subcarriers on its frequency.\n\nWABE has always been operated by the city school system. The license was donated to the school board by the Rich's Foundation on September 8, 1948. It went on the air five days later as Georgia's first educational radio station. It also may well have been the first-ever noncommercial radio station in the Southern U.S., at least on the FM broadcast band. Its first radio studios were located in two rooms of the former Atlanta City Hall. The station moved, along with television station WETV (channel 30, now WPBA), into facilities in northeast Atlanta in 1958, where both stations remain to this day.\n\nThe school board used WABE strictly as a medium for educational (i.e., in-school) broadcasts until sometime in the early 1970s, when classical music broadcasts (and likely evening broadcasts also) premiered on the station. It was a charter member of NPR in 1971, and saw enough promise in the fledgling venture to cut educational programming to six hours a day. On April 13, 1974, WABE boosted its transmission power from 10,000 to 30,000 watts and began broadcasting in stereo. By 1982, the educational programs heard during school hours moved, thanks to the development of subcarrier technologies, to subchannels, leaving the main FM frequency free to broadcast music and news shows for adults.\n\nThe station finally expanded its hours to around-the-clock service and built a much more powerful transmitter on Stone Mountain allowing it to expand its power to a full 100,000 watts. It remained on Stone Mountain until 2004, when transmission moved to the TV tower next to sister station WPBA in the DeKalb County portion of East Atlanta. The short tower atop one of the highest points in metro Atlanta was and still is that of WGTV, the GPTV (now GPB TV) station for the area. WPBA had to leave when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced all television stations to go digital, and the tower was not strong enough to hold four antennae—the other being NOAA Weather Radio station KEC80. (A larger tower was out of the question, as it is scenic and within state-owned Stone Mountain Park.)\n\nSince that time, WABE has grown steadily in listeners served, mainly because Atlanta is one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan areas, and the fastest-growing of the largest 15 or so media markets, now ranked seventh in potential radio listeners by Arbitron.\n\nWell into the 2010s, WABE continued to air classical music during the day, which was unusual for a market of Atlanta's size. As a result, many NPR programs that became mainstays after the network's rapid programming expansion in the 1980s, such as \"The Diane Rehm Show,\" \"Talk of the Nation,\" \"Here and Now,\" \"On Point,\" \"The Story with Dick Gordon\" and the \"BBC World Service\" were not heard in Atlanta until WABE launched an all-NPR news stream on its third HD subcarrier. After years of member consultations WABE dropped daytime classical programming in favor of locally based news programming in 2015.\n\nWABE airs \"Morning Edition,\" \"All Things Considered,\" \"Here and Now\", \"Fresh Air\" and \"Marketplace\" on its analog signal, and \"Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!,\" \"It's Been a Minute,\" \"Bullseye,\" \"Hidden Brain,\" \"Snap Judgment,\" \"Live from Here,\" \"Ask Me Another\" and \"This American Life\" are heard on weekends. A full-time classical HD station and a full-time News station are also available all three channels stream live on the Internet.\n\nThe \"BBC World Service\" airs on WABE's HD news channel.\n\nThe station broadcasts the following HD Radio subchannels:\n\nLisa Rayam: hosts \"Morning Edition\".\n\nLois Reitzes: longtime host of the morning classical-music program \"Second Cup Concert\" and of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra broadcasts. Now hosts the local Arts and Cultural program \"City Lights\". She came to WABE in 1979 from WFIU-FM in Bloomington, Indiana. Reitzes served as a classical-music host for WFIU while working toward a double major in piano and musicology at Indiana University. Reitzes is also an accomplished pianist.\n\nRose Scott: hosts \"Closer Look\"\n\nJim Burress: hosts \"All Things Considered\".\n\nSteve Goss: joined WABE after 28 years at Peach 94.9 FM (WPCH, later WLTM) as local host of \"Morning Edition\". Now heard on \"Mara's Music Mix\" with Mara Davis.\n\nDenis O'Hayer: the former political reporter for WXIA-TV and longtime news anchor at NewsRadio 640 WGST in Atlanta—anchored the afternoon \"All Things Considered,\" and \"Morning Edition\" (When Steve Goss retired).

Johnson: a legendary Atlanta broadcaster in his own right, he has hosted the Saturday-night \"Jazz Classics\" show since the late 1970s. He also hosts 'Blues Classics\" on Friday Nights. Johnson, known only by his first initial (he has admitted on the air that his actual first name is Herman), for many years was a disc jockey on WAOK-AM, one of Atlanta's heritage African-American stations. The program's theme is a rendition of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" by jazz artist and Episcopal clergyman Tom Vaughn.\n\nBuried Truths: Peabody Award–winning series hosted by Hank Klibanoff.\n\nPolitical Breakfast: hosted by Denis O'Hayer.\n\nBottom of the Map: hosted by Christina Lee and Dr. Regina N.

He studied in Jerusalem at the Theological School of the Holy Cross between 1866 and 1872. He then worked as a teacher at the Greek School in Nicosia.\n\nIn 1886 he contested elections to the Legislative Council in the Nicosia–Kyrenia constituency. Although he received enough votes to be elected, one of the losing candidates protested that Papadopoulos was not registered to vote in the constituency, and he voluntarily resigned. However, he was later elected to the Council in a by-election in 1889.

The gardens also has a medicinal herb garden, which is used by the USF College of Pharmacy for research purposes. While not part of the collection, native wildlife, including butterflies and over 60 species of birds, can frequently be found in the garden.\n\nThe USF Botanical Gardens hosts events such as flower and garden festivals, where visitors have the opportunity to learn about and purchase plants from vendors. The gardens also host workshops such as beekeeping workshops, where the public can learn about a specific skill. The USF Botanical Gardens have also hosted yoga classes and is a popular wedding venue.\n\n\n"}

The title of the album was lifted from the book of the same name (\"Le Cru et le Cuit\" in French) by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. Four songs from the album first appeared in film soundtracks in the mid-1980s, three of which were soul tracks from the \"Tin Men\" film. The band had already recorded over half of the album by the time David Z came to produce the remainder. His work with the band, which resulted in dance-rock material, included studio experimentation.\n\nThe album is considered to be an eclectic, varied album, taking influences from numerous genres including Motown soul, rock, funk, British beat and pop. Released in 1988–89 on I.R.S. Records, \"The Raw & the Cooked\" was a major commercial success, selling over three million copies. Numerous singles were released from the album, including the two US number one singles \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"Good Thing\". The album was also critically acclaimed and Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic called the album a masterpiece and one of the 1980s' most exciting albums. A remixed version of the album entitled \"The Raw & the Remix\" was released in 1990.\n\nMultiple songs from \"The Raw & the Cooked\" debuted long before their release on the album; the band's cover of Buzzcocks' \"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\" originally appeared on the soundtrack for the 1986 Jonathan Demme film \"Something Wild\". Three other songs from the album—\"Good Thing\", \"Tell Me What\" and \"As Hard As It Is\"—first appeared in the 1987 film \"Tin Men\", where the Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a band in a nightclub. These three songs have a retro-soul style consistent with the film's 1963 Baltimore setting. At this point, the band were beginning to move away from their \"Sixties soul sound\", but \"Tin Men\" director Barry Levinson persuaded the band to retain the sound on the songs. With these songs, the band had already written and recorded enough songs for one half of the album between their contributions to the two films.\n\nWhile the band were slowly recording the album, they had spent the period so far focusing on side-projects as a result of an unofficial semi-hiatus following their 1985 debut album. Vocalist Roland Gift took to his acting career, filmed highlighted dramatic roles in such films as \"Sammy and Rosie Get Laid\" (1987) and \"Scandal\" (filmed in 1988, released 1989). The rest of the band, David Steele and Andy Cox, however, formed the side-project duo Two Men, a Drum Machine and a Trumpet, an acid house-inspired project which was described as \"high-tech\" and \"danceable.\" In December 1987, they released the single \"Tired of Getting Pushed Around\" on Fine Young Cannibals' label I.R.S. Records, and it reached number 18 in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, Fine Young Cannibals reconvened soon afterwards to focus their attention on writing and recording the remainder of \"The Raw & the Cooked\".\n\nAlthough the band had self-produced the album so far, the band's label MCA Records asked the band to find another producer for the second phase of recording. The band initially considered Latin Rascals and Gil Evans but eventually asked MCA to approach Prince to produce tracks to complete the album. As Prince was unavailable, the label countered with producer David Z, who had worked with Prince and is the older brother of Bobby Z. of The Revolution. The band and David Z recorded three tracks together at Paisley Park Studios, Prince's studio in Minnesota, United States, to complete the album, including the hits \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"I'm Not Satisfied\". David Z recalled that \"they wanted to work with Prince for their next record. They were told that Prince doesn't work with anybody that way, as a producer-for-hire. But they were also told there was someone who works with Prince who does. That was me, and they were willing to try it out.\"\n\nMCA suggested that the band record the tracks they wished to create with Z at Paisley Park Studios so that they \"would have no choice but to work and get the record done\", after the label told Z in a meeting that the band, \"then living in London, had been taking an unusually long time between their first and second records.\" Though the band were polarized by their stay in Minneapolis, with the locals' \"big and blonde\" looks contrasting with their own \"shaved heads\" and \"punk attitudes,\" the band's pre-production process, which \"consisted of sending songs back and forth for consideration\", was very efficient. Z had prompted the band to rewrite the original version of \"She Drives Me Crazy\", which was then called \"She's My Baby\", into the final version.\n\nUnlike the band's debut album \"Fine Young Cannibals\" (1985), the band's recording approach on \"The Raw & the Cooked\" was more experimental. They worked with breakbeat drum loops on occasion, including sampling James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" on \"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be\". Furthermore, the unique snare drum \"pop\" sound on \"She Drives Me Crazy\" was created by Z recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded. Reflecting on creating the snare sound with \"Mix Online\" in 2001, David Z said: \"I took the head off a snare drum and started whacking it with a wooden ruler, recording it through a Shure 57 microphone. As I did that, I started twisting the hell out of the [API 550] EQ around 1 kHz on it, to the point where it was starting to sound more like a crash. I blended that with a snare I found in the Linn itself, which was a 12-bit machine, so it sounded pretty edgy to start with.\" Dan Daley of the website added:\nAlso given complex treatment on the track were the \"staccato single-note lines\" of the guitars, which \"were actually layered six deep, with a few chords thrown in here and there. Some of the lines and chords were actually recorded only once, then manually triggered from a sampler during playback and mixing. One of the lines was also played back through an underwater pool-type speaker Z had laying around, then re-recorded to tape, giving it a muted, mysterious quality that no onboard or outboard EQ could mimic;\" Z stated that \"what really made the guitars stand out, though, was that as Andy [Cox] was playing to chord parts, I was slowly twisting the EQ from one extreme to the other, giving it this wah effect, so every part on the record has a very individual and unique sound. But there aren't many parts at all, so the space between them becomes part of the sound.\" Z and the band denied the label's bother that the vocals were mixed too low, with Z recalling \"we just said go and listen to a Rolling Stones record, and let us know how far the vocals are up front on that.\"\n\nA departure from the political lyrics of the band's first album, the songs on \"The Raw & the Cooked\" concern romantic and longing themes such as love, regret and loss. These have been described as \"traditional soul themes\" by one journalist, in keeping in with the album's soul tributes, and also as pop music by Robert Christgau, who stated that \"the content of these songs seem to concern romantic love. That makes them pop. I can also tell you that I don't much care if I know what they're about or not. That makes them good pop.\" One journalist noticed that the album contains \"almost vacant lyrics\" which \"still sound compelling.\" With the exception of the cover of Buzzcocks' \"Ever Fallen in Love\", Roland Gift and David Steele wrote all the songs on the album, with Andy Cox also credit as co-writing \"It's OK (It's Alright)\". Gift's \"catchy\" and soulful falsetto voice has been compared to Mick Jagger's voice on The Rolling Stones' album \"Black and Blue\" and the second half of \"Tattoo You\", as well as soul singers such as Sam Cooke, Al Green and Otis Redding. His voice was noted for being particularly emotive on \"I'm Not Satisfied\".\n\n\"She Drives Me Crazy\" was originally written as \"She's My Baby\" until Z encouraged the band to rewrite the song; Z stated that \"'She's My Baby' is kind of a nebulous sentiment—it's something you say, but it doesn't hit home. 'She Drives Me Crazy'—now there's something that every guy in the world has said at least once in his life with conviction.\" \"Spin\" said that, unusually for a love song, it is \"neither specific nor evocative, and finds Gift chiming 'cuckoo, cuckoo' in counterpoint with himself.\" \"Good Thing\" describes a departing lover, whilst \"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be\" is a torch song that has been described as \"torrid.\" \"I'm Not Satisfied\" depicts a man who criticizes the weekends for being too short, his girlfriend for being too possessive, and the city for being too depressing. Gift sings in a lower register on \"As Hard as It Is\" than on other songs.\n\n\"The Raw & The Cooked\" combines a variety of styles and genres in keeping in with the band's vision of \"tying past and present musical styles into artful new pop packages.\" Cox himself lightheartedly referred to the album as \"thirty years' worth of pop music in thirty minutes.\" AllMusic stated the album presents very diverse rhythms, most of which are constructed synthetically, and \"a shopping list of genres\" where \"mod, funk, Motown, British beat, R&B, punk, rock, and even disco are embedded within the songs\". One review noted of its diverse directions: \"the funky pop that David Z helped contribute is a far cry from the old-school R&B of the \"Tin Men\" tracks.\" Whilst known for its eclectic array of styles, the album is also generally seen as a tribute to various different styles of American soul music in particular. Robert Christgau noted that the album represents his definition of the \"good pop\" of 1989 in that it features \"mostly admittedly quite hooky\" beats and \"vocal ID\", in addition to multiple hooks and melodies. \"Trouser Press\" magazine said that the album is a \"crafty\" combination of Motown soul and dance-rock, while Martin C. Strong described it as \"potpourri of pop styles and genres, with either Northern soul or Motown at the helm.\"\n\nThe album is split into two-halves which match together disparate styles; the \"Raw\" side, which \"Rolling Stone\" said features \"references to Sam Cooke, the Supremes and doo-wop,\" and the more polished \"Cooked\" side which, according to the same magazine, references \"Prince and up-to-the-second dance beats.\" The \"Raw\" half is said to be more reminiscent of the band's debut album than the \"Cooked\" side. Despite the album being categorized as new wave in American record shops, the album's eclectic scope is said to reflect \"the clashes of tastes\" within the band, who all had varied taste in music. Concerning dance music and their incorporation of the genre, Cox said that \"the dance-music thing is like the punk of the Eighties, rock & roll in the Fifties. It seems to be the thing that is the most vibrant part of modern music.\"\n\nMusically, \"She Drives Me Crazy\" has been described as emphasising the space between its separate parts, with these parts \"all designed to be tight and funk-like in their precision,\" albeit with rock-edged sounds, including the distorted guitar which operates as a counterpoint to \"the vocal melody and Gift's floating falsetto.\" Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic said the song contains \"the most unique, and instantly identifiable, beat/riff combination of the decade.\" \"Good Thing\" is the band's tribute to the northern soul all-nighter parties of the 1960s and 70s, and was referred to by AllMusic's Dave Thompson as \"arguably the apotheosis of the Cannibals's hybrid sound.\" It features a choppy rhythm, and is constructed around a \"slinky R&B riff\" which is further aided by a boogie-woogie piano and \"slammed home with a cracking beat.\" Jools Holland played the piano on the track, noting that it was \"one of the biggest selling records I've ever played on\".\n\n\"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be\" contains keyboards, finger-picked guitar and a prominent, looped sample of the breakbeat from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\".\nAllMusic writer Jo-Ann Greene described the song as having \"a futuristic jungle beat and an almost housey production,\" while \"Rolling Stone\" said the song \"puts a Kangol hat and Adidas shoes on Marvin Gaye.\" \"Tell Me What\" is said to accurately approximate the Tamla Motown sound, albeit with a \"modern touch\" courtesy of its synthesiser. The doo-wop harmonies in the song are said to evoke the music of the 1950s. \"Don't Look Back\" was influenced by 1960s jangle pop pioneers The Byrds, \"while a touch of mid-Sixties Beatles-styled riffing adds further glamor.\" \"Don't Let It Get You Down\" is a funk and acid house song which contains a trumpet solo; \"Rolling Stone\" believed that the combination of acid house and a trumpet solo was perhaps the first in history. The downtempo \"As Hard as It Is\" is a danceable soul song. AllMusic said that, accompanying Gift's soulful vocals, \"it's a stunning performance that the rest of the band deftly back with moody synths, insistent beats, a bassline that thrums with its own pain, and the moodiest of brass solos.\" The cover of \"Ever Fallen in Love?\" is dancehall-tinged.\n\n\"The Raw & the Cooked\" was released in Europe in January 1989 by I.R.S. Records and London Records, and in February 1989 in the United States. The title of the album was lifted from the book of the same name (\"Le Cru et le Cuit\" in French) by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In effort to appear marketable and in order not to alienate those put off by the usage of the term \"cannibals\" in the band name, the band often adopted the abbreviation FYC in this era, and the \"FYC\" logo dwarves the band's full name on the album cover and on its singles. The band made numerous concert and television appearances to promote the album, touring the United States in September and October 1989. Gift appeared on a David Letterman chat show and performed \"She Drives Me Crazy\" with the show's house band; Gift later used this as an example of how the band's songs \"sound completely different\" in the hands of others, saying \"it just sounds just so different even when it's the same music and the same arrangement. It's the people that make up the group. It's like Gestalt.\"\n\nA major commercial success, largely spurred on by the success of its first few singles, \"The Raw & the Cooked\" reached number one in at least five different countries: the United States, United Kingdom, where it stayed on the chart for 66 weeks, Canada, Australia and Austria. Although it reached number 1 in most of those countries in early 1989, it did not reach number 1 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 until July 1989 on the back of the momentum gathered by \"Good Thing\". It spent seven weeks at the top, replacing \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna and being replaced by \"Batman\" by Prince. In the UK, \"The Raw & the Cooked\" was certified 3x Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for at least sales of 900,000, whilst it was certified 6x Platinum in Canada for at least sales of 600,000 and, in the US, 2x Platinum by the RIAA for sales of at least two million copies. The album has sold over three million copies worldwide. \"The Raw & the Cooked\" was remastered and re-released by Edsel Records on 25 February 2013 in a deluxe edition featuring numerous bonus tracks and an entire bonus disc.\n\nAlthough \"Ever Fallen in Love\" was already released as a single in 1986 to promote the \"Something Wild\" soundtrack, reaching number 9 in the UK, and number 19 on the German Singles Chart, \"She Drives Me Crazy\" was released as the official lead single on New Year's Day 1989, a month before the album, with two music videos, the most notable of which was the triple VMA-nominated directed by Philippe Decouflé which featured performers in unusual costumes, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits, as well as a person with a television on their head, marking with similarities to Decouflé's only other music video, New Order's \"True Faith\".\n\nThe crossover success of \"She Drives Me Crazy\" in the United States was considered unusual; initially, the song was only successful on college radio and alternative radio, following in the footsteps of \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"Johnny Come Home\" from the band's first album; however, the song soon became very popular on urban radio, \"in between Bobby Brown and Tone-Lõc.\" Rob Tannenbaum of \"Rolling Stone\" said that, in doing so, \"the Cannibals achieved the rare trick of bridging these two formats as a result of the transitions that took place in the band between albums.\" The song's multi-format compatibility and MTV airplay ultimately landed the single at number 1 in the United States in mid-April where it resided for one week. The song also reached number 1 in Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, and Spain, and number 5 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Good Thing\" was released as the third single on 14 April 1989. It was another number 1 single in the United States and Canada, and also reached number 7 in the UK and number 4 in New Zealand and Ireland, \"Don't Look Back\", released on 25 August 1989, reached number 11 in the US and number 34 in the UK, whilst fifth single \"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be\", released in November 1989, spent eight weeks in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 20. whilst also reaching the top 30 in Austria and the Netherlands, and number 54 in the United States. \"I'm Not Satisfied\" was released as the sixth single on 8 February 1990 and was only reaching number 46 in the UK and number 90 in the US.\nIn October 1990 the seventh Single \"It's OK (It's Alright)\" reached number 44 in Germany and in December 1996 \"Tell Me When\" was released in France but didn't chart!\n\n\"The Raw & the Cooked\" was well received by critics. Jimmy Gutterman of \"Rolling Stone\" in his four-stars-out-of-five review said the album was a \"soulful gem\" that \"far outshines the debut\" and concluded that \"it took a while, but \"The Raw and the Cooked\" is Fine Young Cannibals' great step forward.\" In his review of the same score, Steve Hochman of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a \"sophomore opus\" which \"just may be the best tribute to and update of American soul styles from England since the Rolling Stones' \"Black and Blue\" or side 2 of \"Tattoo You\".\" He said that \"as much as the trio may borrow from Motown or Memphis, there's an original vision that looks forward as well as back.\" In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau rated the album a score of \"A−\", indicating \"a very good record.\"\n\nRetrospective reviews have been even more favourable. In a four-and-a-half star out of five review, AllMusic's Jo-Ann Greene called it \"one of the most exciting albums\" released in the 1980s, commenting how \"in a mere ten songs and 35 minutes the Fine Young Cannibals created a masterpiece.\" Greene said how each of the album's tracks \"simmers with creativity, as the hooks, sharp melodies, and irrepressible beats are caressed by nuanced arrangements and sparkling production. Never has music's past, present, and future been more exceptionally combined.\" In the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", writer Colin Larkin wrote that it contained \"cultivated soul ballads to complement further material of a politically direct nature.\"\n\nThe album won Best British Album at the 1990 Brit Awards. It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1990. In their lists of the greatest albums of 1989, \"LA Times\" ranked it 2nd, \"Musik Express\" ranked it 3rd, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it 9th, \"The Village Voice\" ranked it 13th, and \"NME\" ranked it 41st. \"Q\" also included it in their unordered list of the 50 best albums of 1989. In 1989, German publication \"Tempo\" ranked the album at number 69 in their list of \"The 100 Best Albums of the 80's.\" In 1995, \"Q\" included \"The Raw & the Cooked\" in its publication \"In Our Lifetime: Q's 100 Best Albums 1986–94\", a list compiled to celebrate its 100th issue. Giannis Petridis included it in the 2003 list, \"2004 of the Best Albums of the Century.\" In a 2013 online poll, \"The Raw & the Cooked\" was voted the 30th best album of 1988 based on the opinions of 48,000 respondents.\n\nInspired by the band's success and \"sluggardly production pace\", I.R.S. Records released a remix album entitled \"The Raw & the Remix\" in December 1990. The album, largely consisting of remixes from \"The Raw & the Cooked\", included \"two versions each of 'She Drives Me Crazy,' 'I'm Not the Man I Used to Be' and 'I'm Not Satisfied' as well as danceable overhauls of 'Good Thing,' 'Johnny Come Home' and others.\" The album was said to contain \"significant variations\" upon the original songs, including numerous \"major stylistic adjustments\" such as dub dissections and the Soul II Soul remix of \"I'm Not the Man I Used to Be.\" The album only reached number 61 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe band's record label and manager had never previously experienced success the size of \"The Raw & the Cooked\", and \"they didn't know how to handle it.\" In the words of Gift, \"they kept saying to us our next record had to be even bigger which was really stupid. That was one of the main things that killed it for me.\" As such, the band never recorded a follow up album, and after a hiatus that began in 1992, their first and only song recorded and released after the album was \"The Flame\" for their 1996 compilation album \"The Finest\", and they subsequently disbanded. Gift said \"We just stopped wanting to do it. You might wake up one day and think 'I'm out' but you don't realise it's been at the back of your mind for a while. It was hard to stick to how we appraised the band originally, which was to make great music.\"\n\nThe innovative snare drum sound from \"She Drives Me Crazy\" quickly became heavily sampled among numerous different recordings as well as a popular television advertisement for Pepsi in the early 1990s. Z recalled of the Pepsi advert: \"It was all over television, and there was no doubt as to what had inspired the sound, but it was before people thought seriously about protecting things like sounds. The legalities of sampling were still being thrashed out. No one was sure if you could copyright a beat or a groove.\" He proposed to his lawyer about tackling the Pepsi advert, who responded that Pepsi would win any court case due to them having \"a lot of money and a lot of lawyers.\"\n\nIn a list for \"The Quietus\", Pauline Black of The Selecter named \"The Raw & the Cooked\" as one of her 13 favourite albums ever. At the time of the album's release, she had \"given up on music\" and turned to acting, but said the album renewed her faith in music and inspired her to reform The Selecter, saying \"When I heard the album, I wished I'd done it myself. They were messing around with Tamla and soul and creating their own sound with it. Andy Cox said it was 30 years of pop music condensed into 30 minutes and that’s what it was; everything that had influenced me all wrapped up and repackaged. It renewed my faith in music.\"\n\nAll songs written by Roland Gift and David Steele, except where noted.\n\n\n\nFine Young Cannibals\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n"}

The park is less than one block wide from north to south and two blocks wide from west to east. Its western boundary is Scott Street, and its eastern boundary is Steiner Street. The park is part of the Duboce Park Landmark District.\n\nThe N Judah Muni Metro streetcar line runs along Duboce Avenue, which forms the southern boundary of the park. As such, the park is served directly by the Duboce and Noe Street MUNI station. The train tracks veer away from Duboce Avenue at the western end of the park and enter the Sunset Tunnel.\n\nDuboce Park is a popular site for dog walkers, and off-leash dog play is permitted in the Multi-Use Area (the southeastern section of the park), which officially opened for use on March 8, 2008. West of the Multi-Use area is a fence-enclosed area with a children's play structure. Behind the play area (to the west) is a fenced-in basketball court with multiple rims. Across from the children's play area is a half-moon shaped area designated a Public Lawn Area and intended for use by people only (dogs are not allowed in this area.) In between the Public Lawn Area and the Multi-Use Area is a walking path equipped with water fountains designed, respectively, for human and animal use. Along Scott Street is a labyrinth, completed in 2007, designed for meditation, contemplation, or relaxation.\n\nAlong the west end of the park (along Scott Street) is the Harvey Milk Recreational Arts Building, which underwent expansion/renovation and reopened in June 2009. The facility hosts a number of community events and includes a photography center, a studio for dance and aerobics classes, and a Midnight Music Program. In addition, the Friends of Duboce Park host an Annual Film Festival, featuring movies filmed in San Francisco, in the photography center.\n\nA fake BART station was constructed in the park in 2005 for filming of the movie \"The Pursuit of Happyness\"; it was removed after filming. The park also features in Gus Van Sant's Oscar-winning biopic \"Milk\". A helicopter landed in the park as part of a stunt for the television series \"Trauma\".\n\nSan Francisco's official weather observation site is located in Duboce Park, which is near the geographical and populational center of the city, although data from the automated weather station at San Francisco International Airport, actually located about 10 miles to the south in San Mateo County, often appears as belonging to \"San Francisco\" in media sources outside the Bay Area.\n\nThe park is unusual for having homes directly alongside it. It is one of the few parks in the city without a roadway or walkway separating the park land from buildings.\n\nThe space was designated by the city as public park land in 1858, but it was not until 1902 that the park was built. This coincided with a period of rapid development of homes in the surrounding area, now known as the Duboce Park Landmark District. The 1906 earthquake and fire devastated much of San Francisco; however, the Duboce Park area was relatively undamaged and the park was used as a refuge camp for a year for displaced citizens.\n\nThe park is named after Victor Donglain Duboce.\n\nIn the past, dog owners flouted city leash laws by letting their dogs run free throughout the park.

An all-new design that was investigated internally since at least 1984, the MD-94X was developed in the mid-1980s to compete with the similar Boeing 7J7. The price of oil would have to be at least US$1.40 per gallon for McDonnell Douglas to build the plane, though. Configuration was similar to the MD-80, but advanced technologies such as canard noseplanes, laminar and turbulent boundary layer control, side-stick flight control (via fiber optics), and aluminum-lithium alloy construction were under consideration. Airline interest in the brand-new propfan technology was weak despite claims of up to a 60% reduction in fuel use, and both aircraft were canceled.\n\nUnder development at the same time were two propfan-powered commercial variants of the MD-80. The \"MD-91X\" would have seated 100-110 and entered service in 1991. The \"MD-92X,\" a 150-seat aircraft targeted for service entry in , was originally to be a of the MD-80.

In 1960 she was again nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer - Female for the film \"Blue Denim\".\n\nLynley was born Carole Ann Jones in Manhattan, the daughter of Frances (née Felch) and Cyril Jones. Her father was Irish and her mother, a native of New England, was of English, Scottish, Welsh, and German ancestry. She studied dance in her childhood. Lynley's parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother worked as a waitress until Lynley's income from modelling was enough to sustain the family.\n\nShe had first appeared on a local television show and at the age of 14 she was signed as a child model. She then appeared on live TV shows, the \"Goodyear Television Playhouse\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" and \"Danger Route\".\n\nShe began her career as a child model under the name Carolyn Lee. She appeared on the April 22, 1957, cover of \"Life\" identified as \"Carol Lynley, 15, Busy Career Girl.\" at age 15. When she started acting, she discovered that child actress Carolyn Lee (born Carolyn Copp, 1935) had already registered the name in the Actors' Equity union. She modified it by using the final syllable of Carolyn and fusing it with Lee to make Lynley.\n\nIn her teenage years Lynley appeared in several Clairol and Pepsodent advertisements that were publicized across the country.\n\nIn 1955, she made her first stage appearance in Moss Hart's Broadway stage hit, \"Anniversary Waltz\". At the age of 15, she played the role of Dame Sybil Thorndyke's granddaughter in the Broadway play \"The Potting Shed\".\n\nEarly on, Lynley distinguished herself on both the Broadway stage and in Hollywood screen versions of the controversial drama \"Blue Denim\" (1959), in which the teenaged characters played by Lynley and co-star Brandon deWilde had to deal with an unwanted pregnancy and (then-illegal) abortion.

In 1894, Meredith became the general manager of \"Farmer's Tribune\", a Populist newspaper run by his grandfather.\nMeredith married Edna C. Elliott on January 8, 1896. They resided in Des Moines and were the parents of two children, Edwin T. \"Ed\" Meredith II, and Mildred M. Bohen.\n\nMeredith ran the \"Farmer's Tribune\" until 1902, when he began publishing his own magazine, \"Successful Farming\", which reached 100,000 subscribers by 1908.\n\nMeredith served as Vice President and President of the Agricultural Publishers Association and was a member of the Board of Directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce from 1915 until 1919, and again from 1923 until his death.\n\nOnce a member of the Populist Party, he was later active as a Democrat, and ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate seat in 1914. In 1916, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor.\n\nDespite his unsuccessful campaigns, Meredith maintained a high profile among rural voters and farmers because of his magazine. As a result, Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the Treasury Department's Advisory Committee on Excess Profits, and he served on the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago from 1918 until 1920.\n\nIn 1918 Wilson appointed Meredith to the American War Mission, which visited England and France to observe U.S. military activities and report to Wilson on recommendations for improving conditions for service members serving in World War I.\n\nOn February 2, 1920 Meredith was appointed U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, succeeding David F. Houston, who had been appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nHe was succeeded by Henry C. Wallace at the start of Warren G. Harding's administration in 1921, and he returned to publishing. He bought the \"Dairy Farmer\" in 1922, and later started \"Fruit, Garden, and Home\", which he later renamed \"Better Homes and Gardens\".\n\nIn 1924, Meredith supported William G. McAdoo for President. When the convention deadlocked, Meredith allowed his name to be put forward as Iowa's favorite son before the nomination went to John W. Davis on the 103rd ballot. Davis personally offered the Vice Presidential nomination to Meredith, but he refused the offer. Meredith's supporters planned to suggest his name for President again in 1928, but he declined because of illness.\n\nMeredith died in Des Moines on June 17, 1928, and was buried at Glendale Masonic Cemetery in Des Moines.\n\nAfter his death his company, the Meredith Corporation, continued publication of \"Better Homes and Gardens\" and other magazines. He was later inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame. In 2008, Meredith was named by \"Professional Remodeler\" magazine as one of the 11 most influential people in the history of remodeling.\n\n"}

It sometimes included a representation of a wreath, probably denoting an honour or award.\n\nThe task of carrying the \"signum\" in battle was dangerous, \na soldier had to stand in the first rank and could carry only a small buckler.

{"id": "1807613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807613", "title": "Ornament (art)", "text": "Ornament (art)\n\nIn architecture and decorative art, ornament is a decoration used to embellish parts of a building or object. Large figurative elements such as monumental sculpture and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as applied ornament; in other applied arts the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or vitreous enamel may be used. \n\nA wide variety of decorative styles and motifs have been developed for architecture and the applied arts, including pottery, furniture, metalwork. In textiles, wallpaper and other objects where the decoration may be the main justification for its existence, the terms pattern or design are more likely to be used. The vast range of motifs used in ornament draw from geometrical shapes and patterns, plants, and human and animal figures. Across Eurasia and the Mediterranean world there has been a rich and linked tradition of plant-based ornament for over three thousand years; traditional ornament from other parts of the world typically relies more on geometrical and animal motifs. \n\nIn a 1941 essay, the architectural historian Sir John Summerson called it \"surface modulation\". The earliest decoration and ornament often survives from prehistoric cultures in simple markings on pottery, where decoration in other materials (including tattoos) has been lost. Where the potter's wheel was used, the technology made some kinds of decoration very easy; weaving is another technology which also lends itself very easily to decoration or pattern, and to some extent dictates its form. Ornament has been evident in civilizations since the beginning of recorded history, ranging from Ancient Egyptian architecture to the assertive lack of ornament of 20th century Modernist architecture.\n\nOrnament implies that the ornamented object has a function that an unornamented equivalent might also fulfill. Where the object has no such function, but exists only to be a work of art such as a sculpture or painting, the term is less likely to be used, except for peripheral elements. In recent centuries a distinction between the fine arts and applied or decorative arts has been applied (except for architecture), with ornament mainly seen as a feature of the latter class.\n\nThe history of art in many cultures shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented Insular art of the Book of Kells and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired Carolingian and Ottonian art largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the Romanesque and Gothic periods, but was greatly reduced in Early Renaissance styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in Northern Mannerism, the Baroque and Rococo, was checked by Neoclassicism and the Romantic period, before resuming in the later 19th century Victorian decorative arts and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the Arts and Crafts movement and then Modernism. \n\nThe detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by Alois Riegl in his formalist study \"Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik\" (\"Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament\") of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the \"Kunstwollen\". Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from Ancient Egyptian art and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the arabesque of Islamic art. While the concept of the \"Kunstwollen\" has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider \"corpus\" of examples known today. Jessica Rawson has recently extended the analysis to cover Chinese art, which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the Mongol invasion harmonious and productive.\n\nStyles of ornamentation can be studied in reference to the specific culture which developed unique forms of decoration, or modified ornament from other cultures. The Ancient Egyptian culture is arguably the first civilization to add pure decoration to their buildings. Their ornament takes the forms of the natural world in that climate, decorating the capitals of columns and walls with images of papyrus and palm trees. Assyrian culture produced ornament which shows influence from Egyptian sources and a number of original themes, including figures of plants and animals of the region.\n\nAncient Greek civilization created many new forms of ornament, with regional variations from Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian groups. The Romans Latinized the pure forms of the Greek ornament and adapted the forms to every purpose.\n\nA few medieval notebooks survive, most famously that of Villard de Honnecourt (13th century) showing how artists and craftsmen recorded designs they saw for future use. With the arrival of the print, ornament prints became an important part of the output of printmakers, especially in Germany, and played a vital role in the rapid diffusion of new Renaissance styles to makers of all sorts of object. As well as revived classical ornament, both architectural and the grotesque style derived from Roman interior decoration, these included new styles such as the moresque, a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque (a distinction not always clear at the time). \n\nAs printing became cheaper, the single ornament print turned into sets, and then finally books. From the 16th to the 19th century, pattern books were published in Europe which gave access to decorative elements, eventually including those recorded from cultures all over the world. Andrea Palladio's \"I quattro libri dell'architettura\" (Four Books on Architecture) (Venice, 1570), which included both drawings of classical Roman buildings and renderings of Palladio's own designs utilizing those motifs, became the most influential book ever written on architecture. Napoleon had the great pyramids and temples of Egypt documented in the \"Description de l'Egypte (1809)\". Owen Jones published \"The Grammar of Ornament\" in 1856 with colored illustrations of decoration from Egypt, Turkey, Sicily and Spain. He took residence in the Alhambra Palace to make drawings and plaster castings of the ornate details of the Islamic ornaments there, including arabesques, calligraphy, and geometric patterns. Interest in classical architecture was also fueled by the tradition of traveling on The Grand Tour, and by translation of early literature about architecture in the work of Vitruvius and Michelangelo.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the acceptable use of ornament, and its precise definition became the source of aesthetic controversy in academic Western architecture, as architects and their critics searched for a suitable style. \"The great question is,\" Thomas Leverton Donaldson asked in 1847, \"are we to have an architecture of our period, a distinct, individual, palpable style of the 19th century?\". In 1849, when Matthew Digby Wyatt viewed the French Industrial Exposition set up on the Champs-Elysées in Paris, he disapproved in recognizably modern terms of the plaster ornaments in faux-bronze and faux woodgrain:\n\nBoth internally and externally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament... If each simple material had been allowed to tell its own tale, and the lines of the construction so arranged as to conduce to a sentiment of grandeur, the qualities of \"power\" and \"truth,\" which its enormous extent must have necessarily ensured, could have scarcely fail to excite admiration, and that at a very considerable saving of expense. \n\nContacts with other cultures through colonialism and the new discoveries of archaeology expanded the repertory of ornament available to revivalists. After about 1880, photography made details of ornament even more widely available than prints had done.\n\nModern millwork ornaments are made of wood, plastics, composites, etc. They come in many different colours and shapes.\nModern architecture, conceived of as the elimination of ornament in favor of purely functional structures, left architects the problem of how to properly adorn modern structures. There were two available routes from this perceived crisis. One was to attempt to devise an ornamental vocabulary that was new and essentially contemporary. This was the route taken by architects like Louis Sullivan and his pupil Frank Lloyd Wright, or by the unique Antoni Gaudí. Art Nouveau, popular around the turn of the 20th century, was in part a conscious effort to evolve such a \"natural\" vocabulary of ornament.\n\nA more radical route abandoned the use of ornament altogether, as in some designs for objects by Christopher Dresser. At the time, such unornamented objects could have been found in many unpretending workaday items of industrial design, ceramics produced at the Arabia manufactory in Finland, for instance, or the glass insulators of electric lines.\n\nThis latter approach was described by architect Adolf Loos in his 1908 manifesto, translated into English in 1913 and polemically titled \"Ornament and Crime\", in which he declared that lack of decoration is the sign of an advanced society. His argument was that ornament is economically inefficient and \"morally degenerate\", and that reducing ornament was a sign of progress. Modernists were eager to point to American architect Louis Sullivan as their godfather in the cause of aesthetic simplification, dismissing the knots of intricately patterned ornament that articulated the skin of his structures.\n\nWith the work of Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus through the 1920s and 1930s, lack of decorative detail became a hallmark of modern architecture and equated with the moral virtues of honesty, simplicity, and purity. In 1932 Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock dubbed this the \"International Style\". What began as a matter of taste was transformed into an aesthetic mandate. Modernists declared their way as the only acceptable way to build. As the style hit its stride in the highly developed postwar work of Mies van der Rohe, the tenets of 1950s modernism became so strict that even accomplished architects like Edward Durrell Stone and Eero Saarinen could be ridiculed and effectively ostracized for departing from the aesthetic rules.\n\nAt the same time, the unwritten laws against ornament began to come into serious question. \"Architecture has, with some difficulty, liberated itself from ornament, but it has not liberated itself from the \"fear\" of ornament,\" John Summerson observed in 1941. \n\nThe very difference between ornament and structure is subtle and perhaps arbitrary. The pointed arches and flying buttresses of Gothic architecture are ornamental but structurally necessary; the colorful rhythmic bands of a Pietro Belluschi International Style skyscraper are integral, not applied, but certainly have ornamental effect. Furthermore, architectural ornament can serve the practical purpose of establishing scale, signaling entries, and aiding wayfinding, and these useful design tactics had been outlawed. And by the mid-1950s, modernist figureheads Le Corbusier and Marcel Breuer had been breaking their own rules by producing highly expressive, sculptural concrete work.\n\nThe argument against ornament peaked in 1959 over discussions of the Seagram Building, where Mies van der Rohe installed a series of structurally unnecessary vertical I-beams on the outside of the building, and by 1984, when Philip Johnson produced his AT&T Building in Manhattan with an ornamental pink granite neo-Georgian pediment, the argument was effectively over. In retrospect, critics have seen the AT&T Building as the first Postmodernist building. \n\n\n\n"}

A cue mark is used to signal the projectionist that a particular reel of a film is ending, as most films come to theaters on several reels of celluloid.\n\nCAP coding is a multi-dot pattern that is printed in several frames of a film print of a theatrically exhibited motion picture. It is sometimes accompanied by text code printed on the edge of a motion picture print, outside the visible picture area.\n\nThe dots are arranged in a unique pattern as identification of the particular print of a movie, and are added during manufacture. The marks are not present on the original film negative; they are produced either by physical imprint on the final film print or by digitally postprocessing a digitally distributed film. This enables codes to be customized on a per-copy basis so that they can be used to trace the print to the theaters that played that particular print and to trace any bootleg copies however they were made be they telecined, cammed, or telesynced.\n\nThe original style of CAP code, developed in 1982 by Eastman Kodak along with the Motion Picture Association of America, is a series of very small dots printed in the picture area of a film print.\n\nThe original instance of CAP developed by Kodak is a technology for watermarking film prints to trace copies of a print, whether legal or not.\n\nA newer and more common variation has been developed by Deluxe Laboratories. It makes use of more visible dots, and was developed to thwart film copying from theatergoers with camcorders, or prints that have been illicitly telecined to videotape or DVD.\n\nDeluxe's version has been given the pejorative name of \"crap code\" by filmgoers. The term \"crap code\" was coined on a movie projectionists' discussion forum, due to its quite intrusive nature when viewing. These dots are usually placed on bright areas of a film frame, so they can be more easily identified, and are a reddish-brown color.\n\nA different marking system is CineFence, introduced by Philips in 2006 and commercially available in 2008.\n\nThe Digital Cinema System Specification by Digital Cinema Initiatives mandates forensic marking of digital film; CineFence is the first marking system that complies with this standard.\n\nCineFence claims to be imperceptible to the viewer, but robust to copying and encoding, and encodes 35 bits/5 minutes.\n\n\n"}

Because of their low cost and ease of use, cable ties are ubiquitous, finding use in a wide range of other applications.\n\nThe common cable tie, normally made of nylon, has a flexible tape section with teeth that engage with a pawl in the head to form a ratchet so that as the free end of the tape section is pulled the cable tie tightens and does not come undone. Some ties include a tab that can be depressed to release the ratchet so that the tie can be loosened or removed, and possibly reused. Stainless steel versions, either naked or coated with a rugged plastic, cater for exterior applications and hazardous environments.\n\nThe most common cable tie consists of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the cable tie has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it is prevented from being pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.\n\nA cable tie tensioning device or tool may be used to apply a cable tie with a specific degree of tension. The tool may cut off the extra tail flush with the head in order to avoid a sharp edge which might otherwise cause injury.\n\nIn order to increase resistance to ultraviolet light in outdoor applications, nylon containing a minimum of 2% carbon black is used to protect the polymer chains and extend the cable tie's service life. Blue cable ties are supplied to the food industry and contain a metal additive so they can be detected by industrial metal detectors. Cable ties made of ETFE (Tefzel) are used in radiation-rich environments. Red cable ties made of ECTFE (Halar) are used for plenum cabling.\n\nStainless steel cable ties are also available for flameproof applications—coated stainless ties are available to prevent galvanic attack from dissimilar metals (e.g. zinc-coated cable tray).\n\nPlastiCuffs are handcuffs based on the cable tie design and are used by law enforcement to restrain prisoners. Cable ties are also sometimes used to prevent hubcaps (also known as wheel trims) from falling off a moving vehicle, and some are sold specifically for this purpose.\n\nCable ties were first invented by Thomas & Betts, an electrical company, in 1958 under the brand name Ty-Rap. Initially they were designed for airplane wire harnesses. The original design used a metal tooth, and these can still be obtained. Manufacturers later changed to the nylon/plastic design.\n\nOver the years the design has been extended and developed into numerous spin-off products. One example was a self-locking loop developed as an alternative to purse-string suture in colon anastomosis.\n\nTy-Rap cable tie inventor, Maurus C. Logan, worked for Thomas & Betts and finished his career with the company as Vice President of Research and Development. During his tenure at Thomas & Betts, he contributed to the development and marketing of many successful Thomas & Betts products. Logan died on 12 November 2007, at the age of 86.\n\nThe idea of the cable tie came to Logan while touring a Boeing aircraft manufacturing facility in 1956. Aircraft wiring was a cumbersome and detailed undertaking, involving thousands of feet of wire organized on sheets of 50-foot-long plywood and held in place with knotted, waxcoated, braided nylon cord. Each knot had to be pulled tight by wrapping the cord around one's finger which sometimes cut the operator's fingers until they developed thick calluses or \"hamburger hands.\" Logan was convinced there had to be an easier, more forgiving, way to accomplish this critical task.\n\nFor the next couple of years, Logan experimented with various tools and materials. On June 24, 1958, a patent for the Ty-Rap cable tie was submitted.\n\nSelf-locking loops are used for closure of the sternum after open chest surgery and at repair of rib fractures in foals.\n\nWithin research, there are self-locking loops, based on the construction of the traditional cable tie, designed for surgery. The device is intended for ligation purposes, by compressing tissue hemorrhage is prevented. The same material is used as in surgical suture (resorbable polymers), therefore the implant can be left in the body where after the material is resorbed by the tissue.\n\nTraditional cable ties, due to their non-resorbable material, may not be left in the body permanently due to the risk of development of chronic granulomas.\nIn urology, short term use of cable ties have been described at partial kidney resection.\n\nCable ties are generally single-use devices. Some models have a button to release the pawl and allow re-use.\n\n\nOther methods of bundling cable together securely and semi-permanently include cable lacing, strapping, binding knots such as the surgeon's knot or constrictor knot, Velcro brand hook-and-loop strips, conveyor belt hooks, twist ties, Rapstrap fasteners, or metal buckle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807681", "title": "Ignaz Friedman", "text": "Ignaz Friedman\n\nIgnaz Friedman (also spelled \"Ignace\" or \"Ignacy\"; full name \"Solomon (Salomon) Isaac Freudman(n)\", ; February 13, 1882January 26, 1948) was a Polish pianist and composer. Critics (e.g. Harold C. Schonberg) and colleagues (e.g. Sergei Rachmaninoff) alike placed him among the supreme piano virtuosi of his day, alongside Leopold Godowsky, Moriz Rosenthal, Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne.\n\nBorn to an itinerant Jewish musician in Podgórze near Kraków, Ignaz Friedman was a child prodigy. He studied with Hugo Riemann in Leipzig and Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna, and participated in Ferruccio Busoni's masterclasses.\n\nFriedman lived in Berlin until 1914 and settled in Copenhagen in 1920.\n\nHis official début in Vienna in 1904 featured a program of three piano concertos, rivaling the similar programs of established titans like Busoni and Godowsky, and he remained a titan throughout his career. His style was quiet and effortless, imbued with a sense of rhythm and color, grounded in a sovereign technique, and much has been written about his peerless interpretations of Chopin in particular.\n\nAs with his compatriot and contemporary Moriz Rosenthal, Friedman's Chopin interpretations, particularly those of the mazurkas, are considered by many to be unsurpassed. Despite having given 2,800 concerts during his career, he sometimes received lukewarm reviews in America in later years, as younger critics were becoming accustomed to modernist playing which stripped romantic interpretation of its agogics and essence. Rachmaninoff admired Friedman's playing very much and considered him as a great virtuoso in a style more romantic than his own. Friedman was never successful in America that has moved onto a much more modern and straightforward presentation with the technology of recording that prompted a different sensibility. Therefore Friedman remains as one of the last representatives of the bygone era even during the life or Rachmaninov. His playing may hold the key to understanding the musicianship of the great composers he so naturally represented. There has been a much repeated quote of playing to the galleries from a questionable source. It is not at all true. If one wishes to see the playing to the galleries today, not doing so is the rare exception as most modern performers display the expected gymnastics at the piano. In the times of Rosenthal, Rachmaninov, Horowitz, Rubinstein, Schnabel and Friedman as well as others, the first lesson taught and learned would be the tasteful presentation of transmission of music through the fingers and not the face. The devotion to the score and the intricate detail through an evolving rubato is Friedman's hallmark.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Friedman was in Europe, but managed to escape when a concert tour in Australia was offered at the last moment. He settled in Sydney and remained there until his death (which occurred on Australia Day, 1948). His last concert was in Sydney on July 24, 1943, after which neuritis in his left hand forced him to retire from the concert platform.\n\nFriedman's relatively few recordings, which have been collected by Naxos Records on five CDs, are widely admired, particularly his Chopin and his nine \"Songs Without Words\" by Mendelssohn. Like most of the great artists of his time who broadcast, much of his recorded material has been lost, including hours of radio recordings made in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nHe composed more than 90 works, mainly piano miniatures, as well as pieces for cello and a piano quintet, but his compositions have not found a niche in the standard repertory. He arranged many works, especially those of J. S. Bach and Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nHe edited an almost complete edition of the piano works of Chopin and also produced editions of Schumann and Liszt.\n\nThe Sydney Conservatorium of Music awards an annual Ignaz Friedman Prize for composition.\n\nFriedman also taught several important pianists, including Joseph Gurt, Ignace Tiegerman and Bruce Hungerford (who also died in a foreign country on Australia Day).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1807702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807702", "title": "German mediatisation", "text": "German mediatisation\n\nGerman mediatisation (; ) was the major territorial restructuring that took place between 1802 and 1814 in Germany and the surrounding region by means of the mass mediatisation and secularisation of a large number of Imperial Estates. Most ecclesiastical principalities, free imperial cities, secular principalities, and other minor self-ruling entities of the Holy Roman Empire lost their independent status and were absorbed into the remaining states. By the end of the mediatisation process, the number of German states had been reduced from almost 300 to just 39.\n\nIn the strict sense of the word, mediatisation consists in the subsumption of an immediate () state into another state, thus becoming \"mediate\" (), while generally leaving the dispossessed ruler with his private estates and a number of privileges and feudal rights, such as low justice. For convenience, historians use the term mediatisation for the entire restructuring process that took place at the time, whether the mediatized states survived in some form or lost all individuality. The secularisation of ecclesiastical states took place concurrently with the mediatisation of free imperial cities and other secular states.\n\nThe mass mediatisation and secularisation of German states that took place at the time was not initiated by Germans. It came under relentless military and diplomatic pressure from revolutionary France and Napoleon. It constituted the most extensive redistribution of property and territories in German history prior to 1945.\n\nThe two highpoints of the process were the secularisation/annexation of ecclesiastical territories and free imperial cities in 1802–03, and the mediatisation of secular principalities and counties in 1806.\n\nAlthough most of its neighbors coalesced into relatively centralized states before the 19th century, Germany did not follow that path. Instead, the Holy Roman Empire largely maintained its medieval political structure as a \"polyglot congeries of literally hundreds of nearly sovereign states and territories ranging in size from considerable to minuscule\". From a high of nearly four hundred – 136 ecclesiastical and 173 secular lords plus 85 free imperial cities – on the eve of the Reformation, this number had only reduced to a little less than 300 by the late-18th century. The traditional explanation for this fragmentation () has focused on the gradual usurpation by the princes of the powers of the Holy Roman Emperor during the Staufen period (1138–1254), to the point that by the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the Emperor had become a mere \"primus inter pares\". In recent decades, many historians have maintained that the fragmentation of Germany – which started out as a large polity while its neighbors started small – can be traced back to the geographical extent of the Empire – the German part of the Empire being about twice the size of the realm controlled by the king of France in the second half of the 11th century – and to the vigor of local aristocratic and ecclesiastical rule from early on in the medieval era. Already in the 12th century, the secular and spiritual princes did not regard themselves as the Emperor's subordinates, still less his subjects, but as rulers in their own right - and they jealously defended their established sphere of predominance. At the time of Emperor Frederick II's death in 1250, it had already been decided that the \"regnum teutonicum\" was \"an aristocracy with a monarchical head\".\n\nAmong those states and territories, the ecclesiastical principalities were unique to Germany. Historically, the Ottonian and early Salian Emperors, who appointed the bishops and abbots, used them as agents of the imperial crown - as they considered them more dependable than the dukes they appointed and who often attempted to establish independent hereditary principalities. The emperors expanded the power of the Church, and especially of the bishops, with land grants and numerous privileges of immunity and protection as well as extensive judicial rights, which eventually coalesced into a distinctive temporal principality: the Hochstift. The German bishop became a \"prince of the Empire\" and direct vassal of the Emperor for his \"Hochstift\", while continuing to exercise only pastoral authority over his larger diocese. The personal appointment of bishops by the Emperors had sparked the investiture controversy in the 11th century, and in its aftermath the emperor's control over the bishops' selection and rule diminished considerably. The bishops, now elected by independent-minded cathedral chapters rather than chosen by the emperor or the pope, were confirmed as territorial lords equal to the secular princes.\n\nHaving to face the territorial expansionism of the increasingly powerful secular princes, the position of the prince-bishops became more precarious with time. In the course of the Reformation, several of the bishoprics in the north and northeast were secularized, mostly to the benefit of Protestant princes. In the later sixteenth century the Counter-Reformation attempted to reverse some of these secularisations, and the question of the fates of secularized territories became an important one in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). In the end, the Peace of Westphalia confirmed the secularisation of a score of prince-bishoprics, including the archbishoprics of Bremen and Magdeburg and six bishoprics with full political powers, which were assigned to Sweden, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. On the other hand, Hildesheim and Paderborn – under Protestant administration for decades and given up for lost – were restored as prince-bishoprics. In addition, the Peace conclusively reaffirmed the imperial immediacy, and therefore the de facto independence, of the prince-bishops and imperial abbots, free imperial cities, imperial counts, as well as the imperial knights. According to one authority, the sixty-five ecclesiastical rulers then controlled one-seventh of the total land area and approximately 12% of the Empire's population, perhaps three and a half million subjects.\n\nDue to the traumatic experience of the Thirty Years' War and in order to avoid a repetition of this catastrophe, the German rulers great or small were now inclined to value law and legal structures more highly than ever before in the history of the Empire. This explains in good part why medium and small states, both ecclesiastical and secular, were able to survive and even prosper in the vicinity of powerful states with standing armies such as Brandenburg/Prussia, Bavaria and Austria.\n\nWhile no actual secularisation took place during the century and a half that followed the Peace of Westphalia, there was a long history of rumors and half-baked plans on possible secularisations. The continued existence of independent prince-bishoprics, an anomalous phenomenon unique to the Holy Roman Empire, was increasingly considered an anachronism especially, but not exclusively, by the Protestant princes, who also coveted these defenseless territories. Thus, secret proposals by Prussia to end the War of the Austrian Succession called for increasing the insufficient territorial base of the Wittelsbach Emperor Charles VII through his annexation of some prince-bishoprics. In 1743, Frederick II's minister Heinrich von Podewils wrote a memorandum that suggested giving to the Wittelsbach Emperor the bishoprics of Passau, Augsburg and Regensburg, as well as the imperial cities of Augsburg, Regensburg and Ulm. Frederick II added the archbishopric of Salzburg to the list and Charles VII went as far as adding the bishoprics of Eichstätt and Freising. The plan caused a sensation, and outrage among the prince-bishops, the free imperial cities and the other minor imperial estates, and the bishops discussed raising an army of 40,000 to defend themselves against the Emperor who contemplated grabbing ecclesiastical land that his coronation oath committed him to protect. Although the sudden death of Charles VII put an end to this scheming, the idea of secularisation did not fade away. It was actively discussed during the Seven Years' War, and again during Joseph II's maneuverings over the Bavarian inheritance and during his later exchange plan to swap Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands, which included a secret provision for the secularisation of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Provostry of Berchtesgaden. Yet, none of these projects ever came close to be implemented because, in the end, key actors appreciated that the secularisation of one single prince-bishopric would open a Pandora's box and have severe repercussions on the institutional stability of the Empire.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the continued existence of the Holy Roman Empire, despite its archaic constitution, was not seriously threatened from the inside. It took an external factor – the French Revolution – to shake the Empire to its foundation and bring its demise.\n\nAfter Revolutionary France had declared war on Prussia and Austria in April 1792, its armies had invaded and eventually consolidated their hold over the Austrian Netherlands and the rest of the left bank of the Rhine by the end of 1794. By then, the French leaders had already resolved more or less openly to annex those lands to the Republic as soon as circumstances permitted. Persuading the German states and princes that were fated to lose their possessions west of the Rhine to come to terms with what amounted to massive French spoliation of German land by compensating themselves with land on the right bank became a constant objective of the French revolutionaries and later Napoleon Bonaparte. Moreover, given that the German Catholic clergy at all levels were the most implacable enemies of the \"godless\" Republic, and had actually provided the first cause of war between France and the Holy Roman Empire through provocative action such as allowing émigré French nobles to carry on counterrevolutionary activities from their land, the French leaders estimated that the ecclesiastical rulers and other clerics – who collectively were the ones who were losing the most on the left bank – should be excluded from any future compensation. On the other hand, the secular rulers entitled to compensation should be compensated with secularized ecclesiastical land and property located on the right bank.\n\nAlready, the Franco-Prussian Treaty of Basel of April 1795 spoke of \"a compensation\" in case a future general peace with the Holy Roman Empire surrendered to France the German territories west of the Rhine, including the Prussian provinces. A secret Franco-Prussian convention signed in August 1796 spelled out that such a compensation would be the Prince-Bishopric of Münster and Vest Recklinghausen. In addition, article 3 provided that the Prince of Orange-Nassau, dynastically related to the king of Prussia who actively defended his interests, would be compensated with the Prince-Bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg if his loss of the Dutch hereditary stadtholdership, which followed the creation of the French-backed Batavian Republic, was to become permanent. Likewise, the peace treaties France signed with Württemberg and Baden the same month contained secret articles whereby France committed to intercede to obtain the cession of specific ecclesiastical territories as their compensation in case their losses became permanent.\n\nSigned in the wake of major French victories over the Austrian armies, the Treaty of Campo Formio of October 1797, dictated by General Bonaparte, provided that Austria would be compensated for the loss of the Austrian Netherlands and Austrian Lombardy with Venice and Dalmatia. A secret article, not implemented at the time, added the Archbishopric of Salzburg and a portion of Bavaria as additional compensation. The treaty also provided for the holding of a congress at Rastatt where delegates of the Imperial Diet would negotiate a general peace with France. It was widely and correctly anticipated that France would demand the formal cession of the entire west bank, that the dispossessed secular princes be compensated with ecclesiastical territories east of the Rhine, and that a specific compensation plan be discussed and adopted. Indeed, on 9 March 1798, the delegates at the congress at Rastatt formally accepted the sacrifice of the entire left bank and, on 4 April 1798, approved the secularisation of all the ecclesiastical states save the three Electorates of Mainz, Cologne and Trier, whose continued existence was an absolute red line for Emperor Francis II. The congress, which lingered on well into 1799, failed in its other goals due to disagreement among the delegates on the repartition of the secularized territories and insufficient French control over the process caused by the mounting power struggle in Paris. \n\nIn March 1799, Austria, allied with Russia, resumed the war against France. A series of military defeats and the withdrawal of Russia from the war forced Austria to seek an armistice and, on 9 February 1801 to sign the Treaty of Lunéville which mostly reconfirmed the Treaty of Campo Formio and the guidelines set at Rastatt. Article 7 of the treaty provided that \"in conformity with the principles formally established at the congress of Rastatt, the empire shall be bound to give to the hereditary Princes who shall be dispossessed on the left bank of the Rhine, an indemnity, which shall be taken from the whole of the empire, according to arrangements which on these bases shall be ultimately determined upon.\" This time, Francis II signed the treaty not only on Austria's behalf but also on behalf of the Empire, which officially conceded the loss of the Austrian Netherlands and the left bank of the Rhine.\n\nThe sudden realization in wake of Campo Formio that the Empire was on the threshold of radical changes triggered a heated debate on the issues of compensation and secularisation conducted in pamphlets, in the press, in the political correspondence within and between the territories and at the Imperial Diet. Among other arguments, the defenders of the ecclesiastical states insisted that it was fundamentally illegal and unconstitutional to dissolve any imperial estates, and that the notion of compensating rulers for lost territory was contrary to all past treaties, where \"each had to bear his own fate\". They contended that even if circumstances now made it necessary, the amount of compensation should be limited to the amount of territory, or income, lost, and that all the Estates of the Empire, and not just the ecclesiastical states, should bear the burden. They warned that a complete secularisation would be such a blow to the Empire that it would lead to its demise. Generally, the proponents of secularisation were less vocal and passionate, in good part because they realized that the course of events was in their favor. Even when they were in agreement with some of the anti-secularisation arguments, they contended that \"Notrecht\" (the law of necessity) made secularisation unavoidable: the victorious French unequivocally demanded it and since peace was essential to the preservation of the state, sacrificing part of the state to preserve the whole was not only permissible but necessary.\nFor its part, Austria was to be consistently hostile to secularisation, particularly in its wholesale form, since it realized it had more to lose than to gain from it as it would result in the disappearance of the ecclesiastical princes and prelates from the Imperial Diet and the loss of their traditional support for the Emperor. Likewise, the Electors of Hanover and Saxony opposed the principles of compensation and secularization, not out of sympathy for the Catholic Church, but because they feared it would lead to the aggrandizement of Prussia, Austria and Bavaria.\n\nThe Final Recess of the Imperial Deputation (German: \"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss\") of 25 February 1803 is commonly referred to as the Imperial law that brought about the territorial restructuring of the Empire by reallocating the ecclesiastical states and the imperial cities to other imperial estates. In reality, neither the Final Recess nor the Imperial Deputation which drafted it played a significant role in the process since many key decisions had already been taken behind closed doors in Paris before the Deputation even started its work. The Final Recess was nevertheless indispensable since it bestowed a constitutional seal of approval on the major territorial and political restructuring that would otherwise have lacked legitimacy.\n\nHard-pressed by Bonaparte, now firmly at the helm in France as First Consul, the Empire was obliged soon after Lunéville to take on the task of drawing up a definitive compensation plan (\"Entschädigungsplan\"). The Imperial Diet resolved to entrust that task to the Emperor, as plenipotentiary of the Empire, while it intended to reserve the final decision to itself. Not wanting to bear the full onus of the changes that were bound to occur under French dictate, Francis II declined. After months of deliberations, a compromise was reached in November 1801 to delegate the compensation task to an Imperial Deputation (\"Reichsdeputation\"), with France to act as 'mediator'. The Deputation consisted of the plenipotentiaries of the Electors of Mainz, Saxony, Brandenburg/Prussia, Bohemia and Bavaria, and of the Duke of Württemberg, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.\n\nSoon after Lunéville, the key German rulers entitled to compensation moved quickly to secure their compensation directly with France, and Paris was soon flooded with envoys bearing shopping lists of coveted territories. The French government encouraged the movement. Bonaparte left the details to his foreign minister Talleyrand, who famously lined his pockets with bribes. Meanwhile, Bonaparte, who had been courting the new Tsar Alexander I, replied favourably to the latter's wish to become involved in the process as co-mediator. On 19 October 1801 the two countries signed an agreement to act jointly as the “mediating Powers”. Essentially, Alexander, whose wife and mother belonged to the princely houses of Baden and Württemberg, wanted to favor his various German relatives and this concurred with France's long-standing aim to strengthen the southern states of Baden, Württemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt and Bavaria, strategically located between France and Austria, the arch-foe.\nHectic discussions and dealings went on, not only with the mediating Powers and between the various princes, but within the various governments as well. Inside the Prussian cabinet, one group pushed for expansion westward into Westphalia while another favored expansion southward into Franconia, with the pro-Westphalian group finally prevailing. Between July 1801 and May 1802, preliminary compensation agreements were signed with Bavaria, Württemberg, and Prussia and others were concluded less formally with Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel and other mid-level states.\n\nFrantic discussions and dealings went on simultaneously in Regensburg, where the Imperial Diet and its Deputation were in session. In particular, many mid and lower ranking rulers who lacked influence in Paris – the dukes of Arenberg, Croy and Looz, the prince of Salm-Kyrburg, the counts of Sickingen and Wartenberg, among others – tried their chances with the French diplomats posted at Regensburg, who could recommend additions or amendments to the general compensation plan, generally in exchange for bribes. Nevertheless, all claims were examined and there was an effort to detect fictitious or exaggerated claims. The Imperial Deputation very seldom examined the claims and grievances, which were almost automatically transferred to the local French officials for decision or referral to Talleyrand in Paris.\n\nA \"general compensation plan\" combining the various formal and informal accords concluded in Paris was drafted by Talleyrand in June 1802, approved by Russia with minor changes, and submitted almost as an ultimatum to the Imperial Deputation when it finally convened at Regensburg for its first meeting on 24 August 1802. It was stated in the preamble that the mediating Powers had been forced to come up with a compensation plan due to the \"irreconcilable differences between the German Princes\" regarding the details of compensation, and the Imperial Deputation's delay in starting its work. It was said that the plan, \"based on calculations of unquestionable impartiality\" endeavored to effect compensation for recognized losses while “maintaining the pre-war balance of power between the key German rulers\", two goals that were somewhat contradictory. The original rationale for compensation, which had been to compensate strictly for territory lost, had been replaced by political objectives: to favor powerful or well-connected rulers and to woo potential allies. \nAs Austria had been excluded from the discussions, its envoy at Paris only learned of the plan when he read it in \"Le Moniteur\". He swiftly negotiated revisions which confirmed both Francis II's Imperial prerogatives and his rights as ruler of Austria. The Habsburgs' compensation package was also augmented with additional secularized bishoprics. Francis II had been hostile to secularisation, but once it became clear that near complete secularisation was unavoidable, he fought as hard as any other ruler to obtain his share of the spoils. He was particularly adamant that his younger brother Ferdinand, who had been dispossessed of his secundogeniture Grand Duchy of Tuscany by the invading French, be adequately compensated.\n\nThe Imperial Deputation, originally entrusted with the compensation process but now reduced to a subordinate role, tended to be seen by the mediating Powers and the key German States as mere constitutional window dressing. This was demonstrated with the Franco-Prussian agreement of 23 May 1802 which, ignoring the Imperial Deputation that has not yet convened, stated that both the King of Prussia and the Prince of Orange-Nassau could take possession of the territories allotted to them immediately after ratification. Two weeks later, the King issued a proclamation listing all the compensation territories awarded to Prussia but he waited until the first week of August 1802 before occupying the bishoprics of Paderborn and Hildesheim and its share of Münster, as well as the other territories that had been allotted to Prussia. The same month, Bavarian troops entered Bamberg and Würzburg a week after Elector Maximilian IV Joseph had written to their respective prince-bishops to inform them of the imminent occupation of their principalities. During the autumn, Bavaria, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Württemberg, and even Austria, proceeded to occupy the prince-bishoprics, imperial abbeys, and free Imperial cities that had been allotted to them. Formal annexation and the establishment of a civil administration usually followed within a few weeks. Such haste was due in good part to the fear that the June plan might not be definitive and therefore it was thought safer to occupy the allotted territories and place everyone before a \"fait accompli\". That strategy was not foolproof however and Bavaria, which had been in occupation of the bishopric of Eichstätt since September, was forced to evacuate it when the Franco-Austrian convention of 26 December 1802 reallocated most of Eichstätt to the Habsburg compensation package. For their parts, the lesser princes and the counts, with little manpower and resources, generally had to wait until the Final Recess was issued before they could take possession of the territories – if any – that were awarded to them as compensation, usually a secularized abbey or one of the smaller imperial cities.\n\nOn 8 October 1802, the mediating Powers transmitted to the Deputation their second general compensation plan whose many modifications reflected the considerable number of claims, memoirs, petitions and observations they had received from all quarters. A third plan was transmitted in November and a final one in mid-February 1803. It served as the basis for the Final Recess that the Deputation issued at its 46th meeting on 25 February 1803. The Imperial Diet approved it on 24 March and the Emperor ratified it on 27 April. The Emperor however made a formal reservation with respect to the reallocation of seats and votes within the Imperial Diet. While he accepted the new ten-member College of Electors, which would for the first time have a Protestant majority, he objected to the strong Protestant majority within the new College of Princes (77 Protestant vs 53 Catholic votes, plus 4 alternating votes), where traditionally the Emperor's influence had been the most strongly felt, and he proposed religious parity instead. Discussions regarding this matter were still ongoing when the Empire was dissolved in 1806.\n\nUnder the terms of the Final Recess, all the ecclesiastical principalities – archbishoprics, bishoprics and abbeys – were dissolved except for the Archbishopric-Electorate of Mainz, the Teutonic Order and the Order of Malta. Archbishop Karl Theodor von Dalberg of Mainz had salvaged his Electorate by convincing Bonaparte that his position as Imperial Archchancellor was essential to the functioning of the Empire. As much of his Electorate, including the cathedral city of Mainz, has been annexed by France, the archbishopric was translated to Regensburg and augmented with some remnants of the Electorate east of the Rhine, and Wetzlar. Dalberg, who was confirmed as Elector and Imperial Archchancellor and gained the new title of Primate of Germany, was to prove a constant and useful ally of Napoleon during the coming years. In addition, under the dogged insistence of the Emperor, the Teutonic Order, whose Grand Master was generally an Austrian archduke, as well as the Knights of St John (Knights of Malta), were also spared and their scattered small domains were augmented with several nearby abbeys. The intent here was to provide livings for some of the 700 noble members of the cathedral chapters whose property and estates had been expropriated when the prince-bishoprics were secularized.\nSome prince-bishoprics were transferred whole to a new owner while others, such as Münster, Trier, Cologne, Würzburg, Augsburg, Freising, Eichstätt, Passau and Constance, were either split between two or several new owners or had some districts or exclaves allotted to different new owners. The substantial property and estates of the bishoprics' cathedral chapters were also expropriated. \n\nThe Final Recess detailed the financial and other obligations of the new rulers toward the former rulers, dignitaries, administrators and other civilian and military personnel of the abolished ecclesiastical principalities. The former prince-bishops and prince-abbots remained immediate to the emperor for their own person. They retained extensive authority, including judicial jurisdiction in civil and some criminal matters over their servants (art. 49). They retained the title and ranking of prince-bishop or prince-abbot for life and were entitled to a number of honors and privileges (art. 50). However, the prince-bishops' palatial residences, such as the Würzburg Residence and Schloss Nordkirchen, passed to new owners and the bishops were granted more modest lodgings as well as the use of a summer residence. The former prince-bishops, prince-abbots and imperial abbots and abbesses were entitled to an annual pension ranging from 20,000 to 60,000 gulden, 6,000 to 12,000 gulden and 3,000 to 6,000 gulden respectively, depending on their past earnings (art. 51). While secularisation stripped the prince-bishops of their political power and abolished their principality, they were still bishops and they retained normal pastoral authority over their diocese, parishes and clergy. Some, such as Bishop Christoph Franz von Buseck of Bamberg, adjusted to their diminished circumstances and stayed in their diocese to carry on their pastoral duties; others, such as Archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo of Salzburg, abandoned their pastoral duties to auxiliary bishops and went to live in Vienna or on their family estates.\n\nThe 51 free imperial cities had less to offer in the way of territory () or population (815,000) than the ecclesiastical states but the secular princes had long resented the independence of the ones enclaved within their territory. With a few exceptions, they suffered from an even worse reputation of decay and mismanagement than the ecclesiastical states.\n\nA few imperial cities had been included in some of 18th century stillborn secularisation plans, chiefly because they were either contiguous to or enclaved within a prince-bishopric targeted for secularisation. While the secret compensation provisions of the treaties of 1796 with Prussia, Baden and Württemberg targeted only ecclesiastical territories, by the time the Congress of Rastatt opened in late 1797, there were widespread rumors about the abolition of at least some cities. Alarmed by such rumors, the imperial cities of the Swabian Circle, where about half of all the imperial cities were located, held a special conference at Ulm in early March 1798 to examine the situation, for which they felt helpless. However, given that it was expected from the start that the handful of the largest and wealthiest cities would maintain their independence, the expected mediatisation of the imperial cities did not raise much public interest. The survival of an imperial city often hung by a thread: while Regensburg and Wetzlar, seats of the Imperial Diet and the Imperial Cameral Tribunal respectively, were still on the short list of imperial cities that were to survive in the June 1802 general compensation plan, they were secularized a few months later in order to beef up the newly created Principality of Aschaffenburg that was to constitute the territorial base of Archbishop von Dalberg, the Imperial Archchancellor. In the end, only Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck, Frankfurt, Augsburg, and Nuremberg survived mediatisation in 1803.\n\nFollowing the Final Recess, the scattered estates of approximately 300 free imperial knights and 99 imperial counts, totaling perhaps 4,500 square miles, should have remained untouched. But by the winter of 1803, the rulers of Bavaria, Hesse-Kassel, and Württemberg began to take possession of these tiny enclaves through a combination of Surrender and Transfer Edicts (Abtretungs- und Überweisungspatenten) and military force. Other smaller rulers, such as the Prince of Leiningen, followed suit. This came to be known as the Rittersturm. \n\nBy autumn 1803, the majority of the knightly estates were de facto annexed by their larger neighbors. In January 1804, the seizures were declared illegal by the Emperor Francis II. Although the Emperor was unable to reverse the annexations, the threat of force put a stop to further seizures. Still, this violence was to have grave consequences for the small princes of the Empire. With the effective end of imperial governance following the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, the violence done unto the knights and counts was extended to these defenseless princes, resulting in a second great mediatisation in 1806. \n\nThe formal mediatisation of the imperial knights and counts was legalized by Article 25 of the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine (Rheinbundakte), which sanctioned unilateral action by territorial states.\n\nWhile the original intent had been to compensate the dispossessed secular rulers only for lost territory, that criterion was to be applied only to the minor princes and the counts who sometimes only received an annuity or a territorial compensation so modest that it had to be augmented with an annuity paid by better provided princes in order that their total income would not be less than their former income.\n\nIn the case of the larger states, they generally received more than the territory they had lost. Baden received over seven times as much territory as it had lost, Prussia nearly five times. Hanover gained the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, even though it had lost nothing. The Duchy of Oldenburg, closely connected to Tsar Alexander I, received a sizeable chunk of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster although it had lost only the income of a toll station. Austria also did relatively well. In addition, the two Habsburg archdukes who had been dispossessed of their Italian realms (the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Modena) were also compensated even though their realms were not part of the Holy Roman Empire. Likewise, the King of Prussia was able to obtain a generous territorial compensation for the dynastically related Prince of Orange-Nassau whose losses had been in the defunct Dutch Republic.\n\nIn all, 112 imperial estates disappeared. Apart from the territory ceded to France, their land and properties were distributed among the seventy-two rulers entitled to compensation.\n\nThe outcome of the compensation process confirmed by the Final Recess of February 1803 was the most extensive redistribution of property in German history before 1945. Approximately of ecclesiastical territory, with some 2.36 million inhabitants and 12.72 million guildens per annum of revenue was transferred to new rulers.\n\nThe position of the established Roman Catholic Church in Germany, the , was not only diminished, it was nearly destroyed. The Church lost its crucial constitutional role in the Empire; most of the Catholic universities were closed, as well as hundreds of monasteries and religious foundations. It has been said that the Final Recess of 1803 did to German land ownership what the Revolution had done to France.\n\nOn 12 June 1806, Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine to extend and help secure the eastern border of France. In reluctant recognition of Napoleon's dismemberment of imperial territory, on 6 August 1806, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II declared the Empire abolished, and claimed as much power as he could retain as ruler of the Habsburg realms. To gain support from the more powerful German states, the former Holy Roman Emperor accepted, and Napoleon encouraged, the mediatisation by those that remained of their minor neighbouring states. Mediatisation transferred the sovereignty of more than 100 small secular states to their larger neighbours, most of whom became founding members of the Confederation in order to participate in the annexations.\n\nBetween the first abdication of Napoleon in 1814 and the Battle of Waterloo and the final abdication of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna was convened by the Great Powers to redraw the borders of Europe. During this time, it was decided that the mediatised principalities, free cities, and secularised states would not be reinstated. Instead, the former rulers who held a vote within the Imperial Diet were to enjoy an improved aristocratic status, being deemed equal to the still-reigning monarchs for marital purposes, and entitled to claim compensation for their losses. But it was left to each of the annexing states to compensate mediatised dynasties, and the latter had no international right to redress if dissatisfied with the new regime's reimbursement decisions. In 1825 and 1829, those houses which had been designated the \"\"Mediatized Houses\"\" were formalised, at the sole discretion of the ruling states, and not all houses that ruled states that were mediatised were recognised as such.\n\nAs a result of the Congress of Vienna, only 39 German states remained.\n\nThe only ecclesiastical entities in Germany not abolished in 1803 were:\n\nThe only free cities in Germany not abolished in 1803 were:\n\nAfter being abolished or mediatised, very few states were recreated.

{"id": "1807756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807756", "title": "Choice of law", "text": "Choice of law\n\nChoice of law is a procedural stage in the litigation of a case involving the conflict of laws when it is necessary to reconcile the differences between the laws of different legal jurisdictions, such as sovereign states, federated states (as in the US), or provinces. The outcome of this process is potentially to require the courts of one jurisdiction to apply the law of a different jurisdiction in lawsuits arising from, say, family law, tort, or contract. The law which is applied is sometimes referred to as the \"proper law.\" Dépeçage is an issue within choice of law.\n\n\nThe \"traditional approach\" looks to territorial factors, e.g. the domicile or nationality of the parties, where the components comprising each cause of action occurred, where any relevant assets, whether movable or immovable, are located, etc., and chooses the law or laws that have the greatest connection to the cause(s) of action. Even though this is a very flexible system, there has been some reluctance to apply it and various \"escape devices\" have developed, which allow courts to apply their local laws (the \"lex fori\") even though the disputed events took place in a different jurisdiction. The parties themselves may plead the case either to avoid invoking a foreign law or agree to the choice of law, assuming that the judge will not of his or her own motion go behind the pleadings. Their motive will be pragmatic. Full-scale conflict cases take longer and cost more to litigate. However, the courts in some states are predisposed to prefer the \"lex fori\" wherever possible. This may reflect the belief that the interests of justice will be better served if the judges apply the law with which they are most familiar, or it may reflect a more general parochialism in systems not accustomed to considering extraterritorial principles of law. One of the most common judicial strategies is to skew the characterization process. By determining that a claim is one involving a contract instead of tort, or a question of family law instead of a testamentary issue, the Court can change the choice of law rules. For example, if an employee is hired by an employer in State A, is injured due to the employer's negligence in State B, and files a lawsuit to recover for the injury in State A, the court in State A might look to the employment contract to see if it contained a clause that governed the employer's duty of care with respect to the employee. If so, the court may be able characterize the claim as a breach of the contract, instead of a tort, and apply the law of the State A either because it was the place where the contract was made (the \"lex loci contractus\") or, if it were the place where the wage or salary was to be paid, where the contract was intended to be performed (the \"lex loci solutionis\").\n\nIn this context, since the 1960s, the courts in the United States began developing a number of new approaches, as well as new escape devices. This reflects the number of different laws that might be relevant in any given case before an American court. There is significant interstate trade and social mobility, and with the laws of each state of the Union representing a possible opportunity for conflict, it was necessary to produce a coherent system that could be applied in the courts of all fifty states.\n\nTo limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law is applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi, which literally means \"send back\", is an attempt to achieve that end.\n\nThe traditional approach is based on the idea that the territorial sovereignty of states must be respected. For example, when an event happens in a state that gives rise to a lawsuit - if two parties are involved in an automobile accident, for example - that state in which the accident occurred provides the parties with certain \"vested rights\". These rights include such things as the ability of a plaintiff to file a lawsuit, the imposition of a statute of limitations to prevent a defendant from being subjected to a lawsuit after too much time has passed, limitations on recovery, and specified burdens of evidence. These so-called \"vested rights\" compete with the policy claims of other states for their laws to be applied. What follows is a generalised summary of the rules. The approach in the U.S. is rather different (see Conflict of laws in the United States).\n\nStatus is relevant for a wide array of issues. Self-evidently, unless the proposed litigant has legal personality, there will be no jurisdiction. It will also be relevant to immigration, entitlement to social security and similar benefits, family law, contract, etc. The choice of law rule, the law of the domicile (\"lex domicilii\") if the forum is common law or law of nationality (\"lex patriae\") or habitual residence if the forum is civil law, applies to determine all question of status and its legal attributes. The \"lex fori\" determines the domicile, nationality or habitual residence, and applies that law to establish an in rem set of rights and capacities. Thus, under some laws, the status of illegitimate affects the rights of inheritance in the case of an intestacy, etc. As to corporations, the choice of law rule is the law of incorporation (the \"lex incorporationis\") for all matters of capacity, validity, shareholders' rights, etc.\n\nThe choice of law rules for contracts are more complicated than the law affecting other obligations because they depend on the express or implied intentions of the parties and their personal circumstances. For example, questions as to whether a contract is valid may depend on the capacity of the parties to enter into a contract. This could be decided by reference to the \"lex domicilii\", \"lex patriae\" or habitual residence of the parties, or for policy reasons, by reference to the \"lex loci contractus\" (where the contract was made). But, if the contract was made electronically, where the contract was actually made must first be decided either by the \"lex fori\" or the putative proper law depending on the forum rules. There may also be problems if the parties selected the place where the contract was made in the hope of evading the operation of some mandatory provisions in another relevant law.\n\nOn the other hand, deciding matters relating to \"performance\" will usually depend on the \"lex loci solutionis\". Another unique characteristic of contracts is that the parties can decide which law should apply for most purposes, and memorialize that decision into the contract itself (see forum selection clause and choice of law clause)although not every jurisdiction will enforce such provisions. For the harmonising provisions on contractual obligations in EU law, see the Rome Convention (contract).\n\nThe Rome I Regulation constrains the choice of law for special types of contracts. With a view to the weaker parties, such as consumers, employees and insurants, special choice of law rules are laid down by articles 5-8. The most important rules for companies, mostly closing contracts with consumers, are listed in Art. 6. Art. 6 (I) defines the consumer contract as a contract where the consumer acts as a private person whereas the businessman acts for his commercial purpose. This articles also says that in absence of an explicit choice of law, a protected consumer contract is governed by the law of the consumer's habitual residence. In Art. 6 (II) the involved parties are given the possibility of a free choice of law. But the choice of law is legally void, if the consumer protection is limited by this choice.\n\nThe presumptive rule for tort is that the \"proper law\" applies. This is the law that has the greatest relevance to the issues involved. In public policy terms, this is likely to be the law of the place where the key elements of the \"wrong\" were performed or occurred (the \"lex loci delicti commissi\"). As established in the case of [1969], both plaintiff and defendants were British Soldiers Residents Stationed in Malta. Having an accident in Malta the court looked at the Lex Loci relating to its dual action-ability.\n\nAs to marriage, both formal and common law, the general rule is the \"lex loci celebrationis\" determines its validity, i.e. the law of the place where the marriage is celebrated, unless the purpose of the marriage offends a public policy of the domicile/nationality/habitual residence state. Hence, some states limit the capacity of their citizens to celebrate a monogamous marriage to a person of the opposite biological sex, or prohibit marriage between degrees of consanguinity, etc. Questions of nullity and divorce straddle Family Law and status because the outcome of the judicial proceedings affects status and capacities, and also overlap with the more general question of when the courts of one state will recognize and enforce the judgments of another state.\n\nThe rule for immovable property (called real property in common law states) is that the \"lex situs\" applies to all questions of title. Movable property (called personal property in common law states) claims are governed by the law of the state in which the property is located at the time the rights are supposedly created. An important distinction, however, must be made for a contract which has some incidental effect on property, both immovable and movable, such as a loan with property pledged as a collateral. If the property is incidental to the contract, then the contract is evaluated under traditional choice of law principles for a contract. If, however, the primary purpose of the contract is to transfer the property, then the entire contract will be evaluated under the law of the state where the property is located.\n\nWhere an inter vivos or testamentary trust includes immovables, reference must be made to the \"lex situs\" on all aspects relating to title and land use. Similarly, title to movables including choses in action, should be determined by \"lex situs\", i.e. the law of place where each item is located at the time the trust is created. Once created, all questions of administration are governed by the law specified in the trust instrument. In the unlikely event that the instrument is silent, the trust would be governed by the proper law.\n\nAll questions of prenuptial trusts and transfers are determined by the law of the transferor's domicile, nationality or habitual residence at the time of the marriage.\n\nAll questions relating to wills (and, as an incidental question, any testamentary trusts which the will purports to create), are governed by the law of domicile, nationality or habitual residence at the time of death. Questions of title affecting immovables are determined under the \"lex situs\".\n\nIllustration: Mr. \"Z\" died in US leaving immovable properties in US and other immovable properties in Kilimanjaro Tanzania. \"lex situs\" the law applicable would be of the place where the immovable is located. that is to say those in US to be administered according to the US laws and those in Tanzania according to the laws of Tanzania.(2013)\n"}
{"id": "1807761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807761", "title": "Milton Bradley (baseball)", "text": "Milton Bradley (baseball)\n\nMilton Obelle Bradley, Jr. (born April 15, 1978) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. Standing and weighing , Bradley was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. During an 11-year career in Major League Baseball, Bradley played with the Montreal Expos (2000–01), Cleveland Indians (2001–03), Los Angeles Dodgers (2004–05), Oakland Athletics (2006–07), San Diego Padres (2007), Texas Rangers (2008), Chicago Cubs (2009), and Seattle Mariners (2010–11). His career was also marred by legal troubles and several notable on-field incidents.\n\nBorn in Harbor City, California, Bradley attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School before he was drafted by the Expos in the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. After playing four seasons of minor league baseball for the organization, he made his major league debut on July 19, 2000. In 2001, Bradley was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for pitching prospect Zach Day; he was again traded in 2004 to the Los Angeles Dodgers. After playing in 216 games for the Dodgers, the most among all teams he has played for, Bradley was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Andre Ethier. Bradley was traded to the Padres in 2007, was granted free agency after one season with the team, and signed with the Texas Rangers in 2007. He was voted to the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game with the Rangers, and led the American League with a .436 on-base percentage and a .999 on-base plus slugging percentage. For the year, Bradley finished 17th in American League Most Valuable Player Award voting.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent, Bradley signed with the Chicago Cubs in January 2009, who traded him in December of that year to the Seattle Mariners. In Seattle, Bradley batted .205 in 2010 and .218 in 2011 before he was released by the club. He has a career batting average of .271 with 135 home runs and 481 runs batted in (RBIs) in 1,042 games played, and was described as having \"power, speed, a strong arm and star qualities\", although \"his temper … has never allowed him to fulfill his immense potential.\"\n\nIn 2013, Bradley was convicted by a jury of nine counts of physically attacking and threatening his wife including four counts of spousal battery, two counts of criminal threats, one count of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of vandalism and one count of brandishing a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to 32 months in prison.\n\nBradley was born on April 15, 1978, in Harbor City, California. His mother, Charlena Rector, worked as a clerk at a local Safeway supermarket, while his father, Milton Bradley Sr., was a veteran of the Vietnam War, and was awarded a Purple Heart for his service. Bradley was named Milton Bradley Jr. when Milton Bradley Sr. filled out his son's birth certificate without Rector's permission. According to Bradley Jr.'s mother, Bradley Sr. was addicted to cocaine, physically abused her, and was homeless for several years. Growing up, Bradley had four half-siblings from Rector's previous marriage.\n\nBradley played baseball at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, and was a teammate of Chase Utley. After graduating high school with a 3.7 grade point average, he committed to California State University, Long Beach, but instead signed with the Expos on July 1, 1996 after being drafted by the team in the second round of the 1996 Major League Baseball June amateur draft.\n\nBradley began his professional baseball career with the GCL Expos of the Gulf Coast League in 1996; in 32 games, he batted .241 with 27 hits. The following season, he played nine games for the GCL Expos and 50 for the Vermont Expos, a short season affiliate of the Montreal Expos. For the Expos, he was named to the postseason New York–Penn League All-Star team. In 1998, he played for the Cape Fear Crocs and the Jupiter Hammerheads, tying for the Croc team lead in doubles with 21 while hitting .302 for the Crocs and .287 for the Hammerheads. While playing for the Harrisburg Senators the next season, he was suspended seven games for starting a fight after he had been hit by a pitch. He also played for the silver-medal-winning United States in the 1999 Pan American Games.\n\nFinishing 76–66, the Senators played the Norwich Navigators for the Eastern League championship. The series was tied two games to two in a best-of-five series. In the final game, Bradley hit a walk-off grand slam with two outs and a full count, in the bottom of the ninth inning, to give the Senators a 12–11 win. During the next season, after playing in 88 games for the Ottawa Lynx, he was promoted to the major league club and made his MLB debut on July 19, 2000. In his debut, he hit three straight singles against the New York Mets; and for the season, he batted .221 with 15 RBI over 42 games played.\n\nFor the 2001 Expos, Bradley played 67 games, including one on April 26 in which he walked to give the Expos the go-ahead run against Rick Ankiel of the St. Louis Cardinals in the top of the 15th inning. On July 31 of that year, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians to serve as a possible replacement for Kenny Lofton; in exchange, the Expos received right-handed pitcher Zach Day. Speaking to the Associated Press about the trade, Indians General Manager John Hart stated:\n\nAfter the deal, Bradley was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and reported to the team on August 2. In addition to the 30 games he played for the Bisons, he also played 10 games for the major league Indians.\n\nOn April 15, 2002, he was placed on the disabled list (DL) following an appendectomy a day earlier at St. Anthony's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. He went on the disabled list again on May 2 with a broken orbital bone and a scratched iris after a batted ball had bounced off the outfield wall and hit him below his left eye while he was trying to make a catch; up to that point, he was hitting .266 in 23 games. After a rehabilitation stint of six games with the Bisons, he was reactivated by the Indians on June 4 and finished the season with a .249 batting average, 38 RBIs and nine home runs.\n\nBradley spent the 2003 campaign with the Indians. Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring and missing the final six weeks of the season with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, while on the DL with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He pleaded not guilty to speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.\n\nOn November 19, 2003 he signed a one-year, $1.73 million contract with the Indians for the Indians to avoid salary arbitration with him. During spring training, he was banned from the Indians' training camp after not running out a popup a game earlier. On April 3, 2004, he was traded to the Dodgers for Franklin Gutiérrez and a player to be named later (Andrew Brown); the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" later reported that manager Eric Wedge had insisted that Bradley be traded.\n\nIn his first game with the Dodgers, playing center field, Bradley went 2-for-3, with two singles and two walks. On June 1, he was ejected from a game by home plate umpire Terry Craft for arguing over balls and strikes. After being restrained by manager Jim Tracy, he returned to the dugout and threw a ball bag onto the field. Bradley was suspended for four games and Tracy for one game. On September 19, he hit a 479-foot home run against the Colorado Rockies in Coors Field. On September 28, during a home game against the Rockies, Bradley mishandled a line drive and was charged with an error. A fan threw a bottle at Bradley, who left his position in right field, picked up the bottle and threw it into the stands, yelling at the fan. Bradley was immediately ejected from the game. The next day, MLB suspended him for the remainder of the season and fined him an undisclosed amount. In postseason play, he hit .273 with a home run while the Dodgers lost the National League Division Series to the St. Louis Cardinals three games to one. He finished the 2004 season batting .267 with 19 home runs and 67 RBIs, but was caught stealing 11 times, tying for eighth most in MLB.\n\nDuring the offseason, Bradley went through anger management counseling. In a game against the San Francisco Giants on April 12, 2005, he drove in two runs with a single to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs, the winning run then scoring on Jason Ellison's error in the same play. On August 25, 2005, after hitting .290 with 38 RBIs in 75 games, he was put on the 15-day DL with a torn patellar tendon and anterior cruciate ligament which rendered him inactive for the remainder of the season. On December 13, 2005, the Dodgers traded him to the Oakland Athletics along with infielder Antonio Pérez for outfielder prospect Andre Ethier.\n\nIn his first season with the Oakland Athletics, Bradley posted a .276 batting average with 14 home runs and 52 runs batted in, in a part-time role. He went on the 15-day DL on May 11, 2006 for a strained oblique muscle and a sprained right knee. On July 30, he hit a three-run walk-off home run to beat the Toronto Blue Jays with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. During game four of the 2006 American League Championship Series versus the Detroit Tigers, Bradley became the third player in MLB history to hit home runs from each side of the plate in a postseason game, joining Bernie Williams and Chipper Jones. For the series, he went nine-for-eighteen with two home runs and five RBIs.\n\nOn June 21, 2007, the Athletics designated him for assignment. A trade completed the next day, which would have sent Bradley to the Kansas City Royals for Leo Núñez, was voided by the Royals because Bradley had sustained an oblique injury in his last game as an Athletic. He was then traded to the San Diego Padres on June 29, with cash, in exchange for Andrew Brown; it was the second time those two players had been traded for each other.\n\nBradley started his tenure with the Padres on the 15-day DL, but came off it on July 7; in July, he batted .364 with four home runs and 12 RBI in 18 games.\nOn September 23, 2007, however, he tore his right ACL while being restrained by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters said that he had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.\n\nWinters was suspended for the remainder of the season and also spent the postseason on the restricted list for the incident, after MLB determined that he had indeed directed obscene language toward Bradley. Bradley was not suspended, MLB finding no need for such discipline since he did not make physical contact with Winters.\nAfter the 2007 season, Bradley agreed to a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers. He announced in early January 2008 that he expected to be healthy and ready to play in the season opener. As the Rangers designated hitter, he led the AL in on-base plus slugging with a .999 mark. He was third in batting average (.321), and led the league in on-base percentage (.443). On making the All-Star game, he stated, \"If I somehow miraculously made it to the All-Star Game, I would be floored. I'd really be totally humbled by that. I'm just happy right now to play, to produce and to be with a good group of guys.\" He was selected to play in his first All-Star Game in 2008 as a designated hitter (DH) after being officially selected as a DH reserve, but due to an injury to David Ortiz he became the starting DH in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game.\n\nAccording to \"The Dallas Morning News\" Bradley attempted to confront Kansas City Royals television announcer Ryan Lefebvre in the press box following a June 2008 game for what he believed were unfair comments made on the air. As the Rangers' designated hitter, Bradley watched the broadcast when he was not batting and took offense to a comparison Lefebvre made between him and Josh Hamilton. Manager Ron Washington and general manager Jon Daniels chased after him and stopped him before he got to Lefebvre, at which point he returned to the clubhouse in tears and said:\n\nHe was quoted by Rangers radio broadcasters as saying that he never intended to physically harm Lefebvre but did want to speak to him; Daniels said he was upset that someone he didn't know was judging him.\n\nOn January 8, 2009, Bradley signed a three-year, $30 million deal with the Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game suspension for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly ball in right field and threw it into the stands, believing it was the third out of the inning when there were only two outs, with runners on third and first base. The umpire allowed the runner on third to score as a sacrifice fly, and allowed the runner on first to advance to third.\n\nLater that month, Cub manager Lou Piniella told Bradley to leave the dugout and go home after he \"went after\" a Gatorade cooler in frustration after flying out in another interleague game, against the Chicago White Sox. Piniella and Bradley later confronted each other in the locker room and exchanged words. Piniella later apologized to Bradley, and reinserted him back into the lineup during the team's next start.\n\nOn September 20, 2009, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry suspended Bradley for the remainder of the season after Bradley, in an interview with the \"Daily Herald\", stated the team lacked a \"positive environment\", that there were \"too many people everywhere in your face with a microphone asking the same questions repeatedly\" and that \"[y]ou understand why [the Cubs] haven't won in 100 years here\". In response, Hendry stated he would not \"tolerate [Bradley] not being able to answer questions from the media respectably.\" Bradley later apologized to the Cubs organization for his remarks. For the Cubs, Bradley hit .257 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs before being traded to the Seattle Mariners for Carlos Silva and cash on December 18, 2009.\n\nBradley was part of a flurry of offseason moves by the Mariners in hopes of returning to the playoffs, having not reached the postseason since 2001. On May 4, 2010, he removed himself from a game, without permission, and left the stadium after an \"angry exchange\" with Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu after Bradley struck out with the bases loaded. The Mariners placed Bradley on the restricted list on May 6, and activated Bradley from the restricted list on May 19. He ended the season on the DL after having been placed there on July 31, retroactive to July 27, prior to arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair a lateral meniscus tear on August 17. He finished the 2010 season batting .205, with eight home runs and 29 RBIs over 73 games played.\n\nOn May 9, 2011, the Mariners designated Bradley for assignment after starting the 2011 season hitting .218 with two home runs and 13 RBI in 28 games. Reportedly, the Mariners lost patience with Bradley due to his performance in a series against the White Sox. In the first game, he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the eighth inning, preventing the Mariners from putting in a pinch-runner due to not having enough available players. In the second game, he was booed for not hustling after several balls hit his way. In the final game, he made a poor throw that led to two White Sox runs. The Mariners released Bradley on May 16.\n\nIn 2003, Bradley met his future wife, Monique Williams, a community relations intern for the Indians, while with the team. In 2005, Bradley was the Dodgers' nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award for working with the Dodgers Dream Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the Long Beach Boys & Girls Clubs, among other charities. Bradley has also opened two baseball academies, one in Long Beach and another in Baldwin Hills. In August 2005, Redondo Beach police received three domestic-violence-related calls from Bradley's house. No charges were filed. In 2006, Bradley filed for divorce but the petition was never finalized. On January 18, 2011, Bradley was arrested at his home in Encino, California and charged with making criminal threats to his wife. When he agreed to participate in an out-of-court hearing process, no charges were filed against him. However, his wife subsequently filed for divorce.\n\nIn January 2013, Bradley was charged with several crimes stemming from five different domestic incidents which occurred in 2011 and 2012. On June 3, 2013, Bradley was convicted by a jury of nine counts of physically attacking and threatening his wife including four counts of spousal battery, two counts of criminal threats, one count of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of vandalism and one count of brandishing a deadly weapon. On July 2, 2013, Bradley received a sentence of 32 months in prison and 52 weeks of anger management and domestic violence classes. Pending appeal, Bradley was released on $250,000 bail. On September 14, 2013, at the age of 33, Bradley's wife died at Encino Hospital Medical Center; an October 10 death certificate listed cryptogenic cirrhosis of the liver, hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest as her causes of death. In 2015, Milton maintained sole custody of his and Monique's two sons.\n\nA Los Angeles appellate court rejected Bradley's appeal on January 21, 2015. \"Sports Illustrated\" reported in May 2015 that following another unsuccessful appeal, Bradley was ordered to begin serving the 32-month sentence for his 2013 convictions, with the hearing judge stating that Bradley's request for leniency was \"breathtaking, frankly, in how callous\" it was. In early 2016, Bradley's request to have his jail sentence reduced was denied by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge.\n\nBy April 2018, Bradley, according to \"Sports Illustrated\", had been married to his second wife, Rachel, for two and a half years. In April 2018, Bradley was charged with spousal battery and taken into custody on bail of $175,000 for allegedly assaulting his wife during a January 2018 incident, at which time Bradley was on probation for his earlier domestic violence conviction. In June 2018 Bradley pleaded no contest to domestic battery, was sentenced to 36 months of probation, and was required to complete 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling.\n"}

Similar to the workings of a pinhole camera, each perforation allows only a very narrow beam of light to enter the eye which reduces the size of the circle of confusion on the retina and increases depth of field. In eyes with refractive error, the result is often a sharper image. However, a second effect may appear at the common bridge between each two adjacent holes, whereby two different rays of light coming from the same object (but each passing through a different hole) are diffracted back toward the eye and onto different places on the retina.\n\nUnlike conventional prescription glasses, pinhole glasses produce an image without the pincushion effect around the edges (which makes straight lines appear curved). While pinhole glasses are claimed to be useful for people who are both near- and far-sighted, they are not recommended for people with over 6 diopters of myopia. Additionally, pinhole glasses reduce brightness and peripheral vision, and thus should not be used for driving or when operating machinery.\n\nMerchants state that after prolonged use, the plastic grating should become easy to ignore. However, each time the user blinks, the horizontal lines of the grating will briefly appear to be thicker. This is because the eyelid moving over the pupil will reduce the amount of light falling onto the retina and thus will briefly remove the lateral inhibition effect which normally makes all the holes appear bigger (and the grating appear thinner). So, as long as the user keeps blinking, they will be constantly reminded of the dark grating covering their eyes.\n\nPinhole glasses have been marketed by various companies on the claim that—combined with certain eye exercises—they could permanently improve eyesight. However, no scientific evidence has been found to support these claims. Due to a lack of formal clinical studies to substantiate this type of claim by companies selling pinhole glasses, this type of claim is no longer allowed to be made in the United States under the terms of a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe pinhole occluder, a device used by ophthalmologists and optometrists for diagnosis of refractive errors, works on the same principles, but is not intended for use outside of diagnosis.\n"}

Stevens later acknowledged that he had essentially written the lyrics to the music of American jazz multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef's \"The Plum Blossom\", from his 1961 \"Eastern Sounds\". Stevens indicated that he \"told Yusef Lateef about it, gave him a big cheque, and in fact, started paying him royalties.\" The song is now released with credits that include Yusef Lateef.\n\nThe B-side, \"Portobello Road\", is about the famous street of the same name and market in London, England. The song lyric was written by American Kim Fowley, and Stevens was asked to collaborate by composing music for it. It was later covered by Stevens' first guitarist, Alun Davies, after signing with Island Records in 1970. Davies' version appeared on his first solo album, \"Daydo\", in 1974.\n\n\"I Love My Dog\" peaked at No. 28 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1966, spending seven weeks on that chart.\n\nThe song has also been covered by Carolyn Hester, Theo Bikel, Linda Tillery and Mike Batt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1807812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807812", "title": "Purgatorius", "text": "Purgatorius\n\nPurgatorius is a genus of four extinct eutherian species typically believed to be the earliest example of a primate or a proto-primate, a primatomorph precursor to the Plesiadapiformes, dating to as old as 66 million years ago. The first remains (\"P. unio\" and \"P. ceratops\") were reported in 1965, from what is now eastern Montana's Tullock Formation (early Paleocene, Puercan), specifically at Purgatory Hill (hence the animal's name) in deposits believed to be about 63 million years old, and at Harbicht Hill in the late Cretaceous and lower Paleocene Hell Creek Formation. Both locations are in McCone County.\n\nThey have also been widely discovered in the early Paleocene Bug Creek fauna, along with leptictids. These deposits were once thought to be latest Cretaceous, but it is now clear that they are Paleocene channels with time-averaged fossil assemblages. It is thought to have been rat-sized long and 1.3 ounces (about 37g) and a diurnal insectivore, who burrowed through small holes in the ground.\n\nPostcanine dentition of \"P. unio\" is documented by 13 dentulous, fragmentary mandibles, a fragmentary maxillary and more than 50 isolated teeth from Garbani Locality 80 km west of Purgatory Hill. \"P. ceratops\" is represented by an isolated lower molar found at Harbicht Hill, McCone County. The report of the occurrence of \"Purgatorius\" in the Late Cretaceous was based on an isolated, worn molar found in a channel filling that contains early Puercan fossils. It is also abundantly represented in Pu 2-3 local faunas in the northern Western interior, suggesting that it came into the area between 64.75 and 64.11 Mya. Fragmentary dentition from the Garbani Channel fauna from \"Purgatorius janisae\" shows that the lower dental formula was 3.1.4.3.\n\nThe type specimen of \"P. unio\", a damaged upper molar, is essentially identical to teeth found at the Garbani Locality. Data from this sample support Van Valen and Sloan's identification of topotypic lower molars, and also demonstrate that the lower dentition of \"P. unio\" includes seven postcanines. The alveolus for the single root of P1, crown unknown, is smaller than those for the canine or P2. The second lower pre- molar is smaller than P3; both are two- rooted. The fourth lower premolar is submolariform. A metaconid is lacking, although on some teeth slight thickenings of the enamel are present in this region. Talonid cusps are slightly differentiated. The first and second lower molars are approximately the same length (M1, average length x=- 1.93 mm, N- 13; M2, x=2.00 mm, N- 9); M. is longer (x= 2.32 mm, N -7). Widths of talonids of M1.2 vary from less than to greater than widths of trigonids. Hypoconulid of M. is enlarged, salient, and on some teeth incipiently doubled by addition of a lingual cusp.\n\nBones from the ankle are similar to those of primates, and were suited for a life up in trees.\n\nFor many years, there has been debate as to whether \"Purgatorius\" is a primitive member of the primates or a basal member of the Plesiadapiforms. Several characters of the dentition of \"Purgatorius\", which includes its incisor morphology, can ally it with later plesiadapiforms. The prism cross sections are highly variable with circular, horseshoe and irregular shapes, while the prisms of cheek teeth are radially arranged. Due to the fragmentary dentaries found in the Garbani Channel fauna from \"Purgatorius janisae\" the morphology of the canine and incisor alveoli suggest the derived gradient in the crown size of: I1>or = I2>I3<C. Isolated upper incisors referable from \"P. janisae\" exhibit some typical plesiadapiform specializations. Due to general morphology of the postcanine dentition of \"Purgatorius\", it could be expected to be characterized as a primitive member of the primates. However, due to the specializations of its incisors of \"P. janisae\" it is considered by some investigators as a basal member of the Pleasiadapiformes \"sensu lato.\"\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of 177 mammal taxa (mostly Cretaceous and Palaeocene fossils), published in 2015, suggests that \"Purgatorius\" may not be closely related to primates at all, but instead falls outside crown-group placentals - specifically as the sister taxon to \"Protungulatum\". Similar results had been obtained in previous studies with far fewer species.\n\n"}

Dorrell most notably served as the head football coach of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 2003 to 2007, compiling a record of 35–27. He led the UCLA Bruins to five bowl appearance in five seasons, but did not coach in the fifth after he was fired in December 2007. Dorrell was the first and only African American head football coach in UCLA's history to date.\n\nKarl attended Helix High School in La Mesa, California, where he played football. He was a two-time all-league selection and an honorable mention All-American as a senior. He led Helix to the CIF San Diego Section second place in 1981.\n\nKarl went on to play football at UCLA, earning four varsity letters in football. He was one of the most successful wide receivers at UCLA with 1,517 receiving yards on 108 receptions. He suffered a shoulder injury in 1984 and was granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA. He played on a team that won the Rose Bowl in 1983, 1984, and 1986, and that won the Freedom Bowl in 1986.\n\nDuring the 1983 season, he was a teammate of quarterback Rick Neuheisel, who would be his eventual successor as UCLA head coach. He caught touchdowns from Neuheisel during the season, including two in the 1984 Rose Bowl.\n\nIn the 1986 UCLA vs. USC game, Dorrell was on the receiving end of a play that the Los Angeles Times dubbed \"Hail Mary, and in your face.\" On the last play of the first half, UCLA quarterback Matt Stevens faked a kneeldown, then pulled up and threw a Hail Mary pass, which was tipped into the hands of the flanker, Dorrell, to put the Bruins up 31–0 at the half. They would go on to win 45–20.\n\nHe had a brief career as a player in the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1987 season, but he was placed on the injured reserve.\n\nDorrell's first job as a coach was in 1988, as a graduate assistant for Terry Donahue at UCLA. That season the Bruins finished the season with a record of 10-2 and defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Cotton Bowl Classic.\n\nIn 1989, he became a wide receivers coach at UCF. In 1990 and 1991 he was the offensive coordinator and receivers coach at Northern Arizona. Under his tutelage, the NAU offense set a school record with 255 first downs in 1991, amassing the second-most total offense (4,539 yards) in a season.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1993, Dorrell coached wide receivers at Colorado. In his first year with the Buffaloes, two of his receivers, Charles Johnson and Michael Westbrook, became just the fourth pair of receivers on the same team in NCAA history to each have over 1,000 receiving yards.\n\nHe then served as wide receivers coach at Arizona State in 1994 before returning to Colorado when they hired his former UCLA teammate, Rick Neuheisel, as their head coach. This time, he would serve as wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator from 1995 to 1998. When Neuheisel left Colorado for Washington, he brought four assistant coaches with him – including Dorrell, who served as the Huskies' offensive coordinator and receivers coach in 1999.\n\nIn both 1993 and 1999, Dorrell was a recipient of Denver Broncos Minority Coaching Fellowships, which allowed him to spend time in the Broncos' training camp. He would return to the team in 2000 to serve as the receivers coach under head coach Mike Shanahan He held this position for three years, coaching players like Rod Smith, a two-time selection to the NFL's Pro Bowl, and Ed McCaffrey, a one time Pro Bowl selection. With the help of Dorrell, Smith and McCaffrey became only the second wide receiver duo to each catch 100 passes in a single season (2000).\n\nKarl Dorrell was hired as the head coach at UCLA, replacing Bob Toledo, who was released at the end of the 2002 regular season. Between Toledo and Dorrell, Ed Kezirian, an athletic department official who oversees the academics for the football team, served as interim coach for the 2002 Las Vegas Bowl. Under Kezirian, the Bruins won the bowl game over New Mexico, 27–13. Dorrell's hiring as head coach was announced on December 19, 2002 by UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero. Ed Kezirian remained on the football staff. Dorrell was brought in at UCLA to clean up a program marred by off-the-field problems in the final years of Bob Toledo's tenure.\n\nThe UCLA Bruins football team under Dorrell recorded a mark of 6–7 in his first season as head coach in 2003, with an appearance in the Silicon Valley Bowl, and a loss to Fresno State. In 2004, his second season, the team finished with a record of 6–6 an appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl, with a loss to Wyoming.\n\nIn 2005, his third season as head football coach, Dorrell was able get his first win against a ranked opponent, No. 21 Oklahoma, featuring Adrian Peterson.\n\nOn October 1, 2005, head coach Tyrone Willingham and his Washington Huskies came to the Rose Bowl for a Pacific-10 Conference game to play UCLA. This was the first time two black head coaches faced each other in a Pac-10 conference game. At the time, Sylvester Croom of Mississippi State was the only other black coach heading an NCAA Division I football program. Dorrell achieved his first win against a top-ten opponent with a 47–40 upset win over No. 10-ranked Cal.\n\nThree Bruin wins in the 2005 season set new school records for biggest comebacks earning the nickname \"The Cardiac Kids.\" They came thanks largely to the heroics of quarterback Drew Olson and tailback Maurice Jones-Drew. In the regular season the Bruins came from down 21 points to win in overtime against both Washington State and Stanford. In the Stanford comeback, the Bruins scored 21 points in the final 7:04 of the fourth quarter. In the Sun Bowl, the Bruins set the record again by coming back from 22 points down.\n\nThe Bruins were ranked No. 7 in the nation until a 52–14 blowout loss to a 3–8 Arizona team. The Bruins came into the UCLA–USC rivalry last regular season game ranked No. 11. They suffered a 66–19 defeat to the No. 1 2005 USC Trojans football team. This was the largest margin of defeat since the series began in 1929 with a 76–0 defeat. The Bruins finished third in the Pac-10 standings.\n\nOn December 30, 2005 his Bruins defeated the Northwestern Wildcats in the Sun Bowl, 50–38, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. At the end of the 2005 season, Dorrell and fellow UCLA coach Ben Howland received pay bonuses for coaching successful seasons. Karl was named Pac-10 co-coach of the year along with USC head coach Pete Carroll.\n\nIn 2006, Dorrell's fourth season, he guided the Bruins to a 7–6 season (5-4 in conference) and a fourth-place Pac-10 finish.\n\nUCLA played its first game at the University of Notre Dame since the 1960s and was leading 17–13, but the Irish scored a touchdown in the final minute to win.\n\nThe most notable victory of his coaching career at UCLA was a 13–9 defeat of No. 2-ranked and Bowl Championship Series title-game-bound USC on December 2, 2006. The win kept the Trojans out of the title game and broke a seven-game UCLA losing streak to the Trojans, thereby preserving the Bruins' eight-game win streak over USC from 1991 to 1998 as the longest run in the history of the rivalry. The victory also clinched a winning season for UCLA.\n\nThe Bruins played in the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco against a Bobby Bowden-coached Florida State team on December 27, 2006 and lost, 44–27.\n\nIn Dorrell's fifth season at UCLA, with 20 returning starters and a team of his own recruits, hopes were high for the Bruins in 2007. After starting the season with a couple of wins over Stanford and BYU, and achieving a No. 11 AP Poll ranking, however, UCLA stumbled against an injured, winless, and unranked Utah Utes team, 44–6. Four weeks later, Dorrell's Bruins fell again; this time 20–6 to an unranked, winless Notre Dame team. The Bruins did, however, post wins against seemingly more difficult PAC-10 opponents, including a No. 10 Cal team. However; the bad taste of losses to teams the Bruins were favored to beat (including an embarrassing 27–7 loss to Washington State) raised questions about Dorrell's play-calling and ability to motivate his players.\n\nAfter the Washington State loss, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero addressed UCLA's inconsistent football performances for the first time, stating \"I will be very interested to see how we finish the season. And you can use that.\" Many took this as a hint that Dorrell's job might be in serious jeopardy. The Bruins would go on to lose to Arizona and Arizona State by a combined score of 58–47, but surprisingly shut out an Oregon Ducks team that a week earlier lost starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy Candidate Dennis Dixon to a knee injury. Heading into the final game of the regular season against crosstown-rival USC, the Bruins still had an outside chance at a Rose Bowl berth that might have saved Dorrell's job; with a victory over USC and some help from Arizona (with a win over ASU), the Bruins could have been the first-ever five-loss team to play in the Rose Bowl. It wasn't to be, however, and the Bruins finished the 2007 Regular season with a miserable offensive performance in a 24–7 loss to USC and a record of 6–6.\n\nOn December 3, 2007, Dorrell was fired during a meeting with athletic director Dan Guerrero. He was offered the choice to coach in the Las Vegas Bowl but decided not to. Defensive coordinator DeWayne Walker served as interim coach for the game, where UCLA lost to BYU. UCLA eventually selected Rick Neuheisel, a former UCLA teammate of Dorrell, as his successor.\n\nDorrell interviewed at Duke University and was a finalist along with eventual hire David Cutcliffe for the head coaching position vacated by Ted Roof. He was also dealt as a candidate for the vacant offensive coordinator position for the Houston Texans. Former Texans offensive coordinator Mike Sherman left for Texas A&M University in November 2007. That position, however, eventually went to Kyle Shanahan.\n\nAfter rumors that he was a candidate to succeed Mike Heimerdinger as Denver Broncos assistant head coach, Dorrell eventually was hired as wide receivers coach for the Miami Dolphins, after having also interviewed with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nHe was named quarterbacks coach on January 26, 2011.\n\nDorrell was hired as quarterbacks coach for the Houston Texans in 2012, coaching Matt Schaub through a Pro Bowl season as the Texans went 12–4. He left the team after the 2013 season.\n\nDorrell was reunited with newly hired Vanderbilt University head coach Derek Mason, joining his staff as the offensive coordinator in January 2014. Mason was a player at Northern Arizona while Dorrell was coaching there early in his career.\n\nDorrell' stint with Vanderbilt lasted only one season. Chris Foster of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Dorrell's West Coast offense did not fare much better in the East than it did in Westwood. The Commodores averaged 17.2 points a game and finished with a 3–9 record.\"\n\nOn January 23, 2015, Dorrell was named the New York Jets wide receivers coach. In the 2015 New York Jets season, Dorrell established the Jets elite wide receiver duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker. Both of them had one thousand yard seasons (Decker – 1,027) (Marshall – 1,502**), combined for an NFL record 26 touchdowns as a duo (Marshall – 14*) (Decker – 12) and a total of 189 combined catches (Marshall – 109**) (Decker – 80).\n\nAlthough the 2016 New York Jets season was a disastrous season for the Jets, the wide receivers were a bright spot in their offense. Although Brandon Marshall declined, and Eric Decker was injured early in the season, third-string wide receiver Quincy Enunwa had a breakout season for the Jets, with 58 catches for 857 yards and 4 touchdowns. Undrafted rookie wide receiver Robby Anderson also had a good season, with 42 receptions, 587 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nOn February 8, 2019, the Miami Dolphins announced they had hired Dorrell as the team's wide receivers coach.\n\nOn February 23, 2020, Dorrell was named the 27th full time head coach for the University of Colorado. He was signed to a 5-year, $18 million contract that would pay him $3.2 million for the first year with $200,000 annual raise in subsequent years.\n\nDorrell and his wife, Kim, have two children, Chandler and Lauren.\n"}
{"id": "1807872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807872", "title": "Hellion (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Hellion (Marvel Comics)\n\nHellion (Julian Keller) is a fictional character, a mutant appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was a member of the student body of the Xavier Institute before its closing and is a member of the X-Men's training squad.\n\nHellion first appeared in \"New Mutants\" vol. 2 #2 and was created by Nunzio DeFilippis, Christina Weir, and Keron Grant.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, to parents who managed to work their way out of poverty to become billionaires, Julian was sent to the Xavier Institute in hopes that he would learn to use his powers with some discretion. Hellion has quickly adopted an attitude of superiority while training at the Xavier Institute that has annoyed some of his classmates. A fast favorite of headmistress Emma Frost, who sees in him great potential for heroism as well as a frightening disposition for personal gain and villainy, Julian named himself 'Hellion' in tribute to the former White Queen's first class of students (who had been killed by Trevor Fitzroy).\n\nHellion has demonstrated quite a significant interest in Sofia Mantega, co-leader of the rival New Mutants squad. The two different personalities had a flirtatious relationship from the beginning, but also often clashed when it came to ideals and beliefs. The two had quite an effect on each other. While Sofia became more rebellious, even helping the Hellions attempt to break Wither out of jail, Julian became more sensitive and more comfortable with his emotions. However, when Sofia rejected Julian's invitation to the school dance, Julian dated all three of the Stepford Cuckoos. By the end of the night, the pair eventually reunited on the dance floor.\n\nDespite his relationship with Sofia, he is particularly hard on her New Mutant teammates like David Alleyne, the New Mutants' other leader, whom he views as possessing a particularly useless mutant power and as a genuine competitor as a leader and strategist. However, when the Blob attacked the school, Julian followed David's plan of attack.\n\nHe had an on-and-off friendship with Elixir, initially befriending him until he learned of his past as a Reaver. However, they have since reconciled and have a more friendly and supportive relationship.\n\nDespite his tumultuous relationship with the New Mutants, he was the one who encouraged Sofia to put her squad back together when they were on the brink of disbanding.\n\nIn the aftermath of M-Day, the previous squad system has been abandoned due to the diminished number of powered students. Those left have been placed to join the only squad that would train under the X-Men, called the New X-Men team. Just prior to the competition, Emma asked Julian to make sure that X-23 was eliminated early. However, when given the chance to knock her out, he saved her instead, because he owed her for doing the same during a session in the \"Danger Cave\". As a result, Emma placed Surge as team leader to punish Julian. Surge and Hellion had a well documented mutual dislike for each other, which only intensified after M-Day.\nWhen Sofia overheard Julian saying the depowered David Alleyne no longer belonged at the Institute, the also now human Mantega ended her relationship with Keller. She abruptly left the Institute and left Hellion angry and distraught. Julian and Sofia have both been known to dream of each other since Sofia left the school.\n\nJulian, having trouble with his powers, is practicing with Beast in the Danger Room when he accidentally blows a hole in the floor. After taking a shower, he goes looking for Mercury when he comes across Loa, Rockslide, and Anole watching the Young Avengers on TV. He eventually finds a bloodied X-23 and finds out Mercury has been kidnapped by the Facility and tags along.\nX-23 uses her underworld contacts to find Mercury’s captors and Julian is horrified when Laura kills people working for the people who created her and he tells her not to. They head to the Facility and are confronted by Kimura and a squad of guards. After a brief fight, Julian throws Kimura a few miles away and together they find Mercury; when they are confronted by a bunch of Predator Xs, one injures his shoulder.\n\nAlongside Nori, Hellion is one of the students who wasn't transported to Limbo. While he and Surge argue about his reckless disregard for her leadership by leaving with X-23 to save Mercury and not telling her, the other students inside the X-Mansion get transported to Limbo while they are still outside. Trance used her powers to get a message to the two. She told them that they were taken to hell and then she said \"Belasco\" and disappeared. Surge and Hellion went to the O*N*E. They found out that Amanda Sefton was in a coma in Germany. The two demanded that they be the ones to go see her. Later Hellion, Surge, and a Sentinel are transported to Limbo by Sefton. They are greeted by thousands if not millions of demons. After Illyana comes to her senses, she teleports everyone back to the X-Mansion.\n\nHellion is one of the students that goes up against the Hulk when he shows up at the Institute. He uses his powers to pin down the Hulk in the first attack but Hulk knocks him away. When Hellion goes in for a second attack he is the first to be defeated. Hulk realizes he is a telekinetic so he gets him out of the way. Hulk smashes his hands together, creating a boom which knocks out Hellion, rupturing his eardrums.\n\nWhile practicing his powers, Julian complains to Mercury about his powers and says he can't deal with anything smaller than a refrigerator, and because Marvel Girl is still in space, he is one of the last telekinetics on the planet. Afterwards, he and Mercury are with the Stepford Cuckoos trying to locate the youngest mutant on the planet when Emma Frost asks to see them both for an interview. He reminds Emma about her bizarre trust speech and how she has blown them off since the Purifier attack. He says that she is just putting a little distance between them in case they don't make it\n\nLater, the students all gather to find out who the youngest student is. During the meeting, Nori kisses Julian in front of Prodigy. Julian pushes her off and notices an upset X-23 leave. He flies off outside and Dust catches up to him. He tells her his best friend is dead, the girl he thought he loves is gone, his mentor flipped out, he can’t stop thinking about a girl who literally scares him, and now he has to deal with Nori. He says it's too hard and while he used to be so sure he has no idea now and there is no one to show him. He then thanks Sooraya for being there.\nHe then walks in on Nori and David in the middle of a fight. He throws David against the ceiling and when he asks Nori if she is OK, David hits him from behind and injures him. He then tells David that he 'didn't kiss her'. to which David replies, 'I know'. He is then told he should go see Elixir about his injuries.\n\nWhile recovering from her injuries, Blindfold predicts that Hellion will be injured. Some of the New X-Men decide to launch a pre-emptive strike against the Purifers. After spying on the Purifers, they are ambushed by the Reavers and Lady Deathstrike, who critically wounds Hellion. Pixie then manages to teleport the team out and are spread between Washington and the Institute. He was later seen aboard the X-Jet with Iceman and the New X-Men during the Sentinel attack on the mansion being treated by Mercury. After getting him to what’s left of the infirmary, Beast and Prodigy manage to stabilize him.\n\nLater, when Predator X attacks the mansion, Hellion is saved by the New X-Men, and Pixie teleports the other New X-Men to Muir Island.\n\nJulian wakes up in a hotel room, still hooked up to medical equipment, after experiencing flashbacks of his injury. He finds Emma Frost watching over him, who soon informs Julian that the X-Men are no more and that the school is gone. Julian immediately panics, claiming Cessily and Sooraya would never have left him, and asks where Laura is, but Emma tells him that everyone is being taken care of. Julian tells Emma that she is taking away everything from him again and Emma puts him to sleep. When Julian awakens again, Emma is gone and he tries to go back home, only to find his parents have put their house up for sale and moved without telling him. Julian begins to search for Magneto, soon finding him and claiming that Magneto needs him.\n\nMagneto refuses, telling him that he knows Julian is extremely hurt by the people he loved, so much so that he wants to hurt them back by joining their \"greatest enemy\". Magneto leaves Julian, telling him to enjoy his time off because a new war for mutant-kind will come soon enough.\n\nJulian is later kidnapped along with Boom Boom and Surge by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen injects him with a modified version of the Legacy Virus. After X-Force comes to save the mutants, they find out Surge and Hellion have been sent to the United Nations building. Before Wolverine can kill the Leper Queen and save Julian, Nori, and Boom-Boom, X-Force is teleported out by Cyclops. However, after completing their mission X-Force travel back in time and head to the United Nations Building to save Julian and Nori, while X-23 saves Boom Boom. Elixir cures Julian and Nori of the Legacy Virus, saving them.\n\nWhen anti-mutant protesters led by Simon Trask march in San Francisco in support of Proposition X, Julian and a number of other mutants attempt to stall their demonstration. When Hellion taunts the protesters, Trask incites a riot. During the chaos, Julian physically assaults Trask on national television. The event calls Norman Osborn and his Dark Avengers to the city to restore order. In the process, Osborn forms his own team of X-Men led by Hellion's former mentor, Emma Frost, and institutes a curfew on the city. Believing this to be a last stand for mutant rights, Hellion gathers a group at a bar owned by the former X-Villain Avalanche with the intent to break curfew and get arrested on TV in non-violent protest. The group fails to make its intended point as Match torches the surrounding area with his powers, and Hellion is arrested by Emma Frost and her Dark X-Men. They are taken into custody after a battle.\n\nLater he is, along with all the other prisoners, saved when Emma and Namor betray Osborn and is currently residing with the rest of the X-Men on Utopia.\n\nHellion is seen with Surge and Prodigy, fighting the resurrected Rusty Collins.\n\nHellion participates in a battle to protect the mutant messiah, Hope, and the remaining mutants on Utopia against Bastion's Nimrod Class Sentinels from the future. During the fight he is overpowered and is injured, losing both of his hands and most of his right forearm. He is placed on life support prior to being shipped to Namor's underwater Atlantean colony for reasons of safety and protection. He is eventually stabilized, but cannot participate in the remaining battle. After the Nimrod fleet is destroyed and Hope defeats Bastion, Hellion confronts her, bitter about his injuries, but is rebuffed by Magneto.\n\nFollowing the events of \",\" Hellion is with Kavita Rao, testing metal hands created by Madison Jefferies; however, his telekinetic energy apparently interferes with the operation of cyborg hands or even conventional prosthetic hands, since none can be adapted to his use. After destroying her lab, Rogue comes to collect him to help out rebuild in San Francisco. During the reconstruction of a building, Hellion is resentful of Hope Summers, blaming her for his injuries. While taking out his anger on some old walls he starts becoming reckless and almost hits Hope and a young girl helping her. Hope goes to confront Julian when Karima flies towards the trio and begins attacking them.\n\nDuring the ensuing battle, Hellion's powers manifest uniquely as he is able to feel the telekinetic wave and the objects it touches down to their sub-atomic structures, moving it through the empty space within atoms to hit a target behind them. After momentarily disposing of Hellion when he is distracted by the other X-Men, who think he initiated the attack, Karima defeats the team and begins procedures to kill them off, but Hellion engages her a second time in a short and brutal assault fueled by his repressed rage, crushing her in battle. Her human side briefly reasserts itself during the fight, asking Hellion to put her out of her misery and stop her from harming others. He does so, delivering a telekinetic onslaught that leaves her in a coma and possibly brain dead. During a conversation with Cyclops, Hellion shows no remorse for his actions and is informed he is on probation. If he cannot control himself, he will either have to leave Utopia or be locked up in the Brig.\n\nIn the \"X-23\" series, Hellion and X-23 address their previous closeness more openly since the events of \"New X-Men\", while he defends her from the scorn of her former New X-Men teammates, who are wary of her due to her involvement with X-Force. After a fire breaks out at a half-way house X-23 was sent to, Hellion goes to visit her in the infirmary on Utopia. When he enters her room, he walks in on what appears to be X-23 stabbing Wolverine. In reality however, Logan's soul has been sent to hell and his body is possessed by a demon. The demon started the fire in the half-way house, murdered its occupants, and has been invading X-23's dreams. While X-23 tries to explain, the demon-possessed Wolverine stabs Hellion in the back. To save his life, X-23 bargains with the demon.\n\nHellion has left Utopia with Wolverine to Westchester to the Jean Grey Academy, which is now being headed by Wolverine.\n\n8 months after the events of \"Secret Wars\", Hellion is shown to be dying of the M-Pox disease after accidentally coming in contact with the Terrigen Mist. He attacks New Attilan in retaliation, but is defeated by Synapse. Hellion is then taken into custody by the Inhumans, with Medusa promising that he will be given medical attention.\n\nHellion was treated and cured of his M-Pox symptoms at the New Attilan General Hospital. As an act of gratitude, he decided to pay the hospital back with volunteer work.\n\nHellion is an unusually strong telekinetic. He is able to fly at supersonic speeds, create telekinetic force fields, unleash powerful blasts of telekinetic force, and levitate and manipulate objects from afar. His telekinetic aura is colored light green and glows around his hands, body, and the objects he telekinetically moves and controls.\n\nWhen Emma unlocked subconscious blocks on his mutant ability, Hellion was able to reach a flight speed several times the speed of sound, faster than one of the O*N*E Sentinel pilots believed possible and destroyed a Sentinel by telekinetically hurling an armored wagon through it, but was severely injured from the physical strain afterward. With this lack of focus, Hellion has difficulty using his telekinetic abilities with fine control such as lifting up a paper clip but has no problem in raw power when it comes to destroying the entire floor that the paper clip resides on. During his battle with Bastion, he said he felt his telekinesis get stronger and he can now control matter at a molecular level. This was proven when he sent a telekinetic blast through Hope and into Omega Sentinel without harming Hope, but completely destroying Omega Sentinel.\n\nIn contrast to most other possessors of extremely strong and powerful telekinesis, Hellion tends to focus and channel his telekinetic energy almost exclusively through his hands, very rarely projecting it as a free flow output directly from his brain. After losing his hands, Hellion's control over his telekinesis was greatly strengthened and magnified, he used his exceptionally powerful telekinesis to feed himself and his telekinetic aura now emanates from his brain. After the \"Age of X\", Dr. Kavita Rao observes that Julian has actually benefited from the experience. She notes that the perception of living a lifetime in that world has allowed Hellion to refine his much stronger telekinetic abilities to fully control and manipulate the artificial hands created for him, a feat that normally could not be accomplished in Julian's condition before the \"Age of X\" reality.\n\nHellion was a Junior S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, part of Dani Moonstar's Hellions squad, and was operating under the codename Scion (the name Hellion was chosen to impress Emma Frost. In this reality, Emma was never his adviser. It is unknown why he chose the name Scion in this reality). He was involved with a fellow-Hellion known as Wind Dancer in this reality.\n\nHellion is a member of the Force Warriors, a select group of telekinetics who rebuild the \"Force Walls\" (telekinetic shields that protect Fortress X) on a daily basis. His fellow Xman Bling! has a fangirl crush on him. Prior to arriving at Fortress X, Hellion was on the run before being attacked by soldiers. During the attack, a laser intended to kill him instantly succeeded in severing his hands and forearms. To replace his lost hands, Hellion utilizes a pair of metal hands that he manipulates with his telekinesis.\n\nIn a possible future, Julian and Laura, who had become the new Wolverine, reestablished their relationship. However, after several years together, he is killed during a superhuman conflict known as the Doom World War.\n\n\n"}

From 2004 to 2007 he served as Presidential Plenipotentiary Representative in the Southern Federal District (North Caucasus and Southern European Russia).\n\nDmitry Kozak is a close ally of Vladimir Putin, having worked with him in the St Petersburg city administration during the 1990s and later becoming one of the key figures in Putin's presidential team. During the 2004 Russian presidential election he worked as the head of Putin's election campaign team. Kozak was one of several members of Putin's circle touted in the media as a possible candidate to succeed Putin as president in 2008.\n\nDmitry Kozak was born on 7 November 1958 in the village of Bandurovo, in the Kirovohrad region of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the USSR).\n\nFrom 1976 to 1978, Kozak served in the special forces (Spetsnaz GRU) of the Soviet military's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\n\nAfter Spetsnaz, he studied at the Vinnitsa Polytechnic Institute before he moved to Leningrad.\n\nKozak graduated from Leningrad State University (now St. Petersburg State University) in 1985 with a degree in law. \nFrom 1985 to 1989, he worked in the Leningrad prosecutor's office as a Prosecutor and Senior Prosecutor. He moved into the business sector in 1989, working as head of the legal department at Monolit-Kirovstroy construction company and chief legal consultant for the Association of Trade Ports.\n\nKozak worked as a public prosecutor in Leningrad and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, holding various legal offices in the city’s administration. In 1998 he became Deputy Governor of Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn 1999, along with other St. Petersburg city officials, he joined the government of Vladimir Putin. He was Chief of Staff from 1999 to 2000. Dmitry Kozak became deputy head of the presidential administration and remained in this position under various titles until 2004. In 2003 he briefly entered international politics and unsuccessfully attempted to solve the conflict between Transnistria and Moldova (see Kozak memorandum).\n\nIn September 2004, Kozak was appointed Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Southern Federal District, replacing Vladimir Yakovlev. On 24 September 2007, he was appointed to the new Russian cabinet headed by Viktor Zubkov as regional development minister, succeeding Vladimir Yakovlev again, and leaving his previous position. On 14 October 2008, he became deputy prime minister of Russia and served until 2020. On 15 January 2020, he resigned as part of the cabinet, after President Vladimir Putin delivered the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution.\n\nAccording to Stanislav Belkovsky, Kozak is not well liked by Putin's entourage, but Vladimir Putin does like Kozak, apparently wanting to appoint Kozak as prime minister in 2004 and tapping Kozak as the successor to Putin as president in 2008, however, Dmitry Medvedev won the presidential race. Alexei Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies said that Putin trusts Kozak as one of his men.\n\nDmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi.\n\nFollowing Russia's intervention into Crimea, Kozak was appointed to greatly strengthen Crimea's social, political, and economic ties to Russia.\n\nOn 28 April 2014, following the Crimean status referendum, the U.S. Treasury put Kozak on the Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN), a list of individuals sanctioned as “members of the Russian leadership’s inner circle.” The sanctions freeze any assets he holds in the US and ban him from entering the United States.\n\nOn 29 April 2014, Kozak was added to the European Union sanctions list due to his role in the 2014 Crimean crisis. He is barred from entering the EU countries, and his assets in the EU are frozen.\n\n\nAs of 2016 he lives in Moscow in the same building as Sergei Ivanov, Victor Ivanov, and German Gref.\n\nKozak is married and has two sons Alexey (born 1984) and Alexander (born 1988).\n\nAlexey Dmitriyevich Kozak (; born 1984) became an Investment Manager of the Direct Investment and Special Projects Department with VTB Capital, a subsidiary of the VTB Group, in 2009.

Ultra-compact laptops capable of running common X86-compatible desktop operating systems are typically classified as subnotebooks.\n\nThe first hand-held device compatible with desktop IBM personal computers of the time was the Atari Portfolio of 1989. Other early models were the Poqet PC of 1989 and the Hewlett Packard HP 95LX of 1991. Other DOS-compatible hand-held computers also existed.\n\nThe Handheld PC was a hardware design for personal digital assistant (PDA) devices running Windows CE. It provides the appointment calendar functions usual for any PDA. The intent of Windows CE was to provide an environment for applications compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system, on processors better suited to low-power operation in a portable device. Originally announced in 1996, the Handheld PC is distinct from its more recent counterparts such as the Palm-Size PC, Pocket PC, or smartphone in that the specification provides for larger screen sizes as well as a keyboard.\n\nTo be classed as a Windows CE Handheld PC, the device must:\n\nOver time, these standards were routinely breached by manufacturers.

The constituency was created in 1983, twenty-three years after Bevan's death, from the upper part of the former Abertillery constituency, the town of Brynmawr from Brecon and Radnor, and Bevan's old Ebbw Vale seat with the exception of the area of the Rhymney Community (formerly Rhymney Urban District). The then-Labour party leader Michael Foot, who had won Ebbw Vale in the by-election following Bevan's death, was the seat's first MP.\n\nUntil 2005, the constituency statistically ranked in the top 20 safest Labour seats in the country by size of majority and by continuous representation by candidates from that party. In the 1983 and 1992 general elections, it was Labour's safest seat.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Labour candidate Nick Smith gained the seat with a 29.2% swing from Independent back to Labour; as one of three seats Labour gained in that election where its government fell. The 2015 result made the seat the 30th safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.\n\nAt the 2005 general election the Labour Welsh Assembly Member Peter Law ran as an independent and won the seat. He had resigned from the Labour Party in protest at the imposition of an all-women candidates' shortlist following the retirement of incumbent MP Llew Smith, and overturned a 19,313 (60%) Labour majority with a significant 9,121 (25%) majority. In 2006 the Labour Party decided not to require an all-women shortlist at the next general election.\n\nLaw died of a brain tumour on 25 April 2006, prompting a by-election in the seat on 29 June. Labour failed to regain the seat as Law's former campaign manager, Dai Davies, was elected to replace him, beating Owen Smith, the Labour candidate who later became MP for Pontypridd.\n\nThe Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats have both been very weak in the seat. From 1987 until 2017 neither had ever won 10% of the vote and the Conservatives had never achieved one eighth of the total votes cast. However, in 2015 the Conservatives achieved just under 15% of the vote, with Plaid Cymru in second place after Labour. In 2005 the Liberal Democrats received their lowest share of the vote in the United Kingdom and the Conservatives their second lowest, and both lost their deposits, though this particular election saw unusual circumstances.\n\nThe 2010 result was one of few where an Independent candidate kept their deposit, winning in excess of 5% of the votes cast, and pushed one of the main three parties into fourth place; the independent Blaenau Gwent People's Voice group fielded no candidate in 2015. Three non-Labour candidates exceeded 5% of the vote (the deposit threshold) in 2015, the foremost locally being UKIP but the Lib Dem and Green candidates failed to retain their deposits.\n\nThe constituency boundaries are analogous to those of Blaenau Gwent county borough.

The constituency is represented by Fay Jones, of the Conservative Party, who defeated incumbent Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds at the 2019 general election.\n\nThe boundaries of the constituency correspond broadly with the ancient counties of Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. Radnorshire is included in full, and the only significantly populated area from Brecknockshire not in this constituency is Brynmawr, which is in Blaenau Gwent. This is the largest constituency in England and Wales by area. No town in the constituency exceeds a population of 10,000, the largest being Ystradgynlais at roughly 9,000. Other towns in the constituency are Brecon, Knighton, Crickhowell and Llandrindod Wells. The remainder of the constituency is largely made up of small villages and land used for farming sheep: sheep outnumber humans in Powys as a whole by around ten to one.\n\nUnder constituency changes announced in September 2016 ahead of the next general election it is proposed to merge this seat with the southern half of Montgomeryshire including Newtown to form a new seat called Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery.\n\nThe constituency was created in the boundary changes of 1918 by merging Breconshire and Radnorshire, both previously constituencies in their own right. While once a Labour stronghold, the constituency was captured from the Conservative government by the SDP–Liberal Alliance at a dramatic by-election in 1985. It was regained by the Conservatives in 1992, taken back by the Liberal Democrat from 1997–2015, and then went back to the Conservatives in 2015 and 2017. It was the Conservative Party's fifteenth target seat at the 2005 election, but their share of the vote fell, leaving it as the Conservatives' 95th target seat in 2010, requiring a swing of 5.09%. In the event, the swing to the Conservatives was 0.3%, and the Liberal Democrats retained the seat, with Roger Williams remaining the MP. In 2015 the seat was reclaimed for the Conservatives by Chris Davies whose majority of 5,102 was the largest in the constituency since Tom Hooson won the seat, also for the Conservatives, in 1983. Roger Williams stood for the Liberal Democrats in 2015 but shed over 6,500 votes from his 2010 result, a loss of 17.8%.\n\nIn 2019, Davies pleaded guilty to filing false expenses claims, triggering a recall petition, the third such petition in the UK. The petition was successful, forcing Davies to vacate the seat. A by-election was held on 1 August, which was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Jane Dodds. Dodds was then defeated by Conservative Fay Jones at the general election in December 2019.\n\nChanges in vote share are compared to the 2017 general election, not the 2019 by-election. \n\nOf the 110 rejected ballots:\n\nFollowing the successful recall petition of Christopher Davies, a by-election was held on 1 August 2019.\n\nOf the 73 rejected ballots:\n\nThe Labour candidate, Chris Mann, won the selection over future AMs Carwyn Jones and Jeffrey Cuthbert, and future AM and MP Peter Law.\n\nGeneral Election 1939/40:\n\nAnother general election was required to take place before the end of 1940.

It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system.\n\nThe constituency was created in 1536 as a District of Boroughs, represented in the House of Commons of England until 1707, in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800, and in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1950. The District of Boroughs was abolished in 1950, and replaced with a county constituency of the same name, which was itself abolished in 2010.\n\nKnown as Carnarvon until 1832, and then as the Carnarvon Boroughs or Carnarvon District of Boroughs from 1832 to 1950 and as Caernarvon from 1950 to 1983, it is named after Caernarfon, the main town within the constituency. Its most famous member was David Lloyd George, who was MP for 55 years. When Lloyd George became prime minister in 1916 it became the first Welsh constituency to be represented by a serving prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru held the seat continuously from 1974 until its abolition in 2010, longer than they have held any other seat.\n\nThe constituency names, in this section, follow the format and the spelling used by F. W. S. Craig in his \"British Parliamentary Election Results\" series. Variations may be found in other sources.\n\nOn the basis of information from several volumes of the \"History of Parliament\", it is apparent that the history of the borough representation from Wales and Monmouthshire is more complicated than that of the English boroughs.\n\nThe Laws in Wales Act 1535 (26 Hen. VIII, c. 26) provided for a single borough seat for each of 11 of the 12 Welsh counties and Monmouthshire. The legislation, which was passed in 1536 (using the modern civil year starting on 1 January), was ambiguous as to which communities were enfranchised. The county towns were awarded a seat, but this in some fashion represented all the ancient boroughs of the county, as the others were required to contribute to the member's wages. It is not clear if the burgesses of the contributing boroughs could vote. The only election under the original scheme was for the 1542 Parliament. It seems that only burgesses from the county towns actually took part. An Act of 1544 (35 Hen. VIII, c. 11) confirmed that the contributing boroughs could send representatives to take part in the election at the county town. As far as can be told from surviving indentures of returns, the degree to which the out boroughs participated varied, but by the end of the 16th century all the seats had some participation from them at some elections at least.\n\nThe original scheme was modified by later legislation and decisions of the House of Commons, which were sometimes made with no regard to precedent or evidence: for example in 1728 it was decided that only the freemen of the borough of Montgomery could participate in the election for that seat, thus disenfranchising the freemen of Llanidloes, Welshpool and Llanfyllin.\n\nIn the case of Caernarvonshire (now Caernarfonshire), the county town was Caernarvon (now known as Caernarfon). The out boroughs were Conway (now Conwy), Criccieth (or Cricieth), Nevin (now known as Nefyn), and Pwllheli. The freemen of the five boroughs were entitled to vote. In the 1715–1754 period there were estimated to be about 1,600 freemen, of whom about 1,200 were non-resident. Later in the 18th century the estimated electorate was about 1,000 freemen.\n\nThe Caernarvon Boroughs was a district of boroughs constituency, which grouped a number of parliamentary boroughs in Caernarvonshire into one single member constituency. The voters in each participating borough cast ballots, which were added together over the whole district to decide the result of the poll. The enfranchised communities in this district, from 1832, were the six boroughs of Caernarvon, Bangor, Conway, Criccieth, Nevin, and Pwllheli.\n\nThe exact boundaries of the parliamentary boroughs in the district were altered by the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1868, but the general nature of the constituency was unchanged. There were no further boundary changes in the 1885 redistribution of parliamentary seats.\n\nIn 1918 the constituency was redefined, to include the then local government areas of the Municipal Boroughs of Bangor, Caernarvon, Conway, and Pwllheli; the Urban Districts of Criccieth, Llandudno, Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr, as well as the Lleyn Rural District.\n\nFrom 1918 to 1950 the administrative county of Caernarvonshire was divided into two seats: Caernarvon Boroughs and a Caernarvonshire county constituency. The territory of the borough seat was enclaved within the county constituency. Different local authorities, included in the borough constituency, were not necessarily adjoining.\n\nThe redistribution, which took effect in 1950, created two Caernarvonshire county divisions – Caernarvon in the south-western two thirds of the county and Conway (later spelt Conwy) in the north-eastern third. The new divisions included territory which had come from both of the two old seats.\n\nThe local authorities, whose territories were combined to form the constituency in 1950, were the Municipal Boroughs of Caernarvon, and Pwllheli; the Urban Districts of Criccieth, and Portmadoc; as well as the Rural Districts of Gwyrfai and Lleyn. This arrangement was not altered by the redistribution which took effect in February 1974, which was based on the pre-1974 local government boundaries.\n\nFrom 1 April 1974, a new pattern of counties was created in Wales. This constituency became part of the county of Gwynedd.\n\nIn the redistribution of 1983, the spelling of the official name of the constituency was changed. The constituency boundary was unchanged, but it was redefined in terms of the local authorities created in 1974. It comprised the Borough of Arfon wards numbered 8 to 12 and 16 to 29, together with the District of Dwyfor.\n\nIn 1996 Welsh local government was again reorganised. Arfon and Dwyfor became part of a Gwynedd unitary authority.\n\nThe Parliamentary Constituencies (Wales) Order 1995, based on the pre-1996 local authority areas, came into effect in 1997. It defined this constituency as:-\n\n(i) The following wards of the Borough of Arfon, namely, Bethel, Bontnewydd, Cadnant, Deiniolen, Llanberis, Llandwrog, Llanllyfni, Llanrug, Llanwnda, Menai (Caernarfon), Peb-lig, Penisarwaun, Penygroes, Seiont, Talysarn, Waunfawr and Y Felinheli; and\n\n(ii) the District of Dwyfor.\n\nFollowing radical boundary changes undertaken by the Boundary Commission for Wales, this seat was abolished in time for the general election in 2010, replaced by Arfon and part of Dwyfor Meirionnydd.\n\n\nHughes' death caused a by-election.\n\n\n"}
