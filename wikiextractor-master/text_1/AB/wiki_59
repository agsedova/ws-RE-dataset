The club has won the Danish championship five times and the Danish cup title six times.\n\nThe club's homeground is Vejle Stadium in Nørreskoven (the northern forest) since 1922. The club has played in red shirts and white shorts since 1911.\n\nThe main rivals of Vejle Boldklub are AGF from Aarhus and AC Horsens from Horsens.\n\nIn July 2011, Vejle Boldklub merged with Kolding FC and became Vejle Boldklub Kolding. The merger however was short lived and in June 2013 it was split into Vejle Boldklub and Kolding IF.\n\nThe club was founded by 23 men from Vejle on 3 May 1891 as a cricket club. Football first became a part of the club's activities in 1902.\n\nThe period from 1910 to 1920 is often referred to as Vejle Boldklub's first golden age. In this period the club took part in the Jutland championship final seven times and won it four times in 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915.\n\nAbout 15,000 people were seated at Vejle Stadium on 22 May 1952, when Vejle Boldklub secured promotion to the second best Danish league in a match against Odense KFUM. One of the central players in the Vejle team was Bent Sørensen, who later went on to become the club's first national team player.\n\nOn 10 May 1956, VB in front of 25,000 people in Parken, Copenhagen, met B93 in a qualification game for a place in the best Danish league. Once again Bent Sørensen scored the winner. After this VB played in the best Danish league for 36 years, which is the record.\n\nIn 1958 the club won its first Danish championship, and also went on to win the Danish cup. This made VB the first club in Denmark to win the Double. Among the stars in the squad was Tommy Troelsen and Henning Enoksen. Tommy Troelsen was only 17 years old when he played in the final.\n\nNormally 15,000–20,000 people attended the matches in Vejle those days. K.B. were beaten 8–3 and Odense Boldklub were sent home with a 7–2 defeat. The manager was Frits Gotfredsen and he was the man who started developing the attacking style of play that made VB the most popular club in Denmark in this period.\n\nThe 1959 season also offered great moments for the history books. The biggest triumph was without a doubt the cup win against AGF. 33,000 people came to the national arena to watch the match between the two great clubs from Jutland. VB won the game 1–0, but it has never been decided who scored the winner. Both the ball, Henning Enoksen and a couple of AGF players were in the net. However, it was a goal and VB could celebrate the club's second cup win in two years.\n\nAt the Olympic Games in Rome in 1960 four VB players were selected in the Danish side which sensationally won a silver medal. The four VB players were: Henning Enoksen, Tommy Troelsen, Poul Mejer and Poul Jensen (captain).\n\nIn 1971 Vejle Boldklub celebrated its 80 years jubilee and the players gave the club the best birthday present possible: the Danish championship trophy and the club's first ticket to the European Champions Cup. The trophy was won through great attacking football, and there was never any doubt that VB would win it.\n\nDanish football followers were impressed with the new top side in Danish football and thousands of people came to Vejle to enjoy the charming football of Vejle Boldklub. Among the many stars in the team were Allan Simonsen and Flemming Serritslev. The manager was once again Frits Gotfredsen. He ended his amazing career in Vejle Boldklub after this big triumph.\n\nIn the 1972 season VB went on to prove that the team was now on top of Danish football. The Danish championship in 1971 was followed up by another cup triumph and once again the Danish championship ended up in Vejle – The Double.\n\nThe title was won even more convincingly than the year before after ten straight victories in the spring half of the season. It was simply VB and the others. After the 1972 season VB's biggest star, Allan Simonsen, joined German giants Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he was named European Footballer of the Year in 1977 – so far the only Danish player in history.\n\nIn the 1975 season VB did not live up to the huge expectations in the league. However, the club delivered some great attacking football in the cup tournament and went on to win the final for the fourth time with a 1–0 victory over Holbæk. Club record holder, Gert Eg, scored with a great first timer, which qualified VB for the European Cup Winners Cup.\n\nThe 19 May 1977 Vejle Boldklub won its third cup final in only six years. The fifth cup triumph was won with a 2–1 victory against B1909. The goal scorers for Vejle was Ib Jacquet and Knud Nørregård. VB could now call itself the best cup team in Denmark – a status that was taken away from AGF.\n\nVejle reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup-Winners' Cup in the 1977–78 campaign.\n\nIn the following season, 1978, Vejle Boldklub underlined its top position in Danish football by winning the Danish title for the fourth time in the club's history. Manager Poul Erik Bech and his players could celebrate the victory in Vejle before the last game as AGF and Esbjerg fB could no longer catch the reds. Among the stars in the team were Alex Nielsen, Tommy Hansen and Ulrik le Fevre, who later became the first player to score Tor des Jahres in the German Bundesliga.\n\nIn 1978 Vejle Boldklub became the first team to win the Danish title after the involvement of money in Danish football. But as it turned out VB would find it difficult to adapt to the new times.\n\nHowever, at the start of the decade VB continued in the footsteps of the successful 1970s teams. On 28 May 1981 Boldklubben Frem was beaten 2–1 in the cup final. This meant that the beautiful trophy – which Danish clubs had been fighting for since 1955 – was brought to Vejle permanently and placed in the club house in Nørreskoven.\n\nIn 1983 Allan Simonsen – named third best player in Europe the same year – returned to Vejle Boldklub. Simonsen had a big impact on the team and was a major influence as the club went on to win its fifth Danish title in 1984. With this victory the greatest trophy in Danish football found a permanent spot in the club house in Vejle next to the cup winners trophy. Among the biggest stars in the squad were John Sivebæk, Allan Simonsen and Steen Thychosen, who became the league top scorer with 24 goals.\n\nAfter some indifferent seasons VB was in 1988 taken over by four local businessmen. Once again the club started dreaming about titles and the fans were excited by the signings of star players such as Preben Elkjær Larsen, John Larsen and Keld Bordinggaard. However, the new manager Ebbe Skovdahl could not get the team to work together even though he had several star players in his side.\n\nVejle Boldklub's centenary was celebrated in the worst possible manner with relegation to the second tier for the first time since 1956. Many star players went to play for other clubs and a sad atmosphere of crisis descended upon Vejle. The four businessmen left the club, but ensured on their way out that it was not in dire straits. To turn things around VB hired their old star player Allan Simonsen as new manager. However, it was a thankless task for Simonsen, who started his managerial career with a defeat.\n\nIn 1994 the successful manager from 1981, Ole Fritsen, was named as the new manager of Vejle Boldklub. As a former youth coach in the club, Ole knew all about the many talented young players in VB, amongst which were Kaspar Dalgas and Peter Graulund. Ole started to build up a new team around these young players.\n\nVejle Boldklub was back in the top Danish league in 1995. Ole Fritsen's young team played impressive, charming and attacking football, which earned them runners-up medals in 1997 and qualification for the UEFA Cup on two occasions. For his fine work, Ole Fritsen was named Danish Manager of the Year in 1997.\n\nAt the beginning of the new millennium, VB was relegated from the Danish super league for the second time in the club's history. They were back after only one season in the first division, but it turned out to be a short respite as the club was relegated the same season. This proved to be the beginning of a serious crisis. In 2004, VB was almost relegated to the third tier division and the club was threatened with bankruptcy. This resulted in desperate attempts to save the club through amalgamations with clubs in the north, south, east and west.\n\nBut, in late 2004, another turning point was reached when a group of visionary businessmen reconstructed the club's finances and launched the so-called four point plan: A new stadium, promotion to the Danish super league, income through business other than football and a new sponsor strategy. In 2006, VB was back in the first division. However, the club made a dreadful start to the season with nine defeats in a row. But a successful second half of the season pointed it in the right direction and optimism returned.\n\nToday, VB draws together the most successful businesses in south-east Jutland, which makes the club potentially one of the wealthiest in Danish football. And where the club earlier had to look in vain for local support, today it is seen as an attractive investment.\n\nIn spring 2008, Vejle Boldklub opened the gates to its new modern stadium. It retains the name of Vejle Stadium and is still located in Nørreskoven.\n\nOn 5 June 2008, VB achieved a record in scoring the highest number of points to win the Danish 1st Division. Promotion to the Superliga was secured with 78 points from 30 matches.\n\nBy the 32nd round of the 2008–09 season, it was clear VB would be relegated to play in the Danish 1st Division during the 2009–10 season.\n\nOn 8 December 2010, Vejle Boldklub announced that the club known as Vejle Blodklub would merge with Kolding FC and from July 2011 would be known as Vejle Boldklub Kolding. This would mark an end for Vejle Boldklub and the beginning of yet another Danish fusion club.\n\nIn November 2012 Kolding IF withdrew from the agreement with Vejle Boldklub. This resulted in the dissolution of Vejle Boldklub Kolding, and Vejle Boldklub inherited the merger club's licence in the Danish 1st Division for the upcoming 2013–14 season.\n\nDanish Championship\n\nDanish Cup\n\n1973 was the year when Vejle Boldklub made its debut in the European Champion Clubs' Cup. Vejle was put up against one of the biggest clubs in Europe at the time: Anderlecht from Belgium. Vejle gave the Belgians a good match, but the reds could not keep Anderlecht from progressing in the tournament.\n\nThe highlight of Vejle Boldklub's European history came in 1978, when the club went all the way to the quarter finals in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, where VB lost out to Dutch side FC Twente.\n\nIn the 1985–86 season, Vejle lost to eventual Champions' Cup winners FC Steaua Bucureşti, after a first-leg tie: 1–1, 1–4.\n\nThe last time Vejle Boldklub played in Europe was in 1998–99, when the reds were drawn with Real Betis in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Betis came to Denmark with a great team including the star player Denílson. But against all odds VB won the first match against the Spanish stars as Peter Graulund scored the winner in the dying minutes of the game. However, in Sevilla VB could not follow up on the good result and lost 5–0.\n\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n\nNote: 1D = Danish Superliga, 2D = Danish 1st Division\n\n\n\n\n"}

He continued at this position for a number of years and at several clubs including Sivasspor, Düzcespor and Çanakkale Dardanelspor. It was here that he was originally moved to defence, and he took it in his stride as he made the position of central defence his own.\n\nHe soon joined Malatyaspor and was extremely impressive as Malatyaspor defied expectations to remain in the Turkish Superlig in their first season in the top flight, in the 2001/2002 season. The next season was even more impressive as a late season run enabled Malatyaspor to claim a UEFA Cup place for the next season. By this point, Tolga had made his first appearances for the Turkish national team and was being courted by many clubs, but remained with Malatyaspor for the beginning of the next season.\n\nWhen the Malatyaspor manager Ziya Doğan left to join Trabzonspor in January 2004 he took Tolga with him. Tolga has since developed into one of the best defenders in Turkish football.\n\nEighteen months later, Tolga was bought by the Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk.\n\nTolga is a powerful big defender who uses his frame to stifle opponents in the air and on the ground. He is very quick for his size and despite playing in defence still impresses with the number of goals he scores, obviously due to his experience in playing for many years as a striker. Tolga won the Ukrainian championship and is thinking about a comeback to Trabzonspor.\n\nIn July 2006, Galatasaray had made an agreement with Tolga to play for them, on loan for one season.\n\nIn July 2010, he turned back where he was born Giresun for one year contract with Giresunspor which team is playing in Turkish 1st division \"Bank Asya League\".

His early training and enterprising temper produced in adult life an ambition to propagate Christianity and suppress the slave trade in Africa. He attached himself to the English Anti-Slavery Society, and under its auspices he went out to Malta, where he took part in the editing of a newspaper and also engaged in the study of the Arabic language and of geography, with a view to systematic exploration.\n\nRichardson made an expedition in 1845 from Tunis and Tripoli in Libya to Ghadames and Ghat in the middle of the Sahara. Here he collected information about the Tuareg and arrived after nine months back again in Tripoli. After he had published \"Travels into the great desert of Sahara\" (2 Books. London 1849), he succeeded to convince the British government to equip an expedition into Sudan and to Lake Chad. In March 1850 Richardson went for the second time to Ghat accompanied by Heinrich Barth and Adolf Overweg. His party were the first Europeans to cross the stony elevated plain of the Hammada. James Richardson died of unknown illness on this journey on 4 March 1851 in Ngurutua, a six-day journey away from Kukawa near Lake Chad.

His father and his grandfather, Peter van Sittart (1651–1705), were both wealthy merchants and directors of the Russia Company. Peter, a merchant adventurer, who had migrated from Danzig to London about 1670, was also a director of the East India Company. The family name is taken from the town of Sittard in Limburg, the Netherlands. They settled at Shottesbrooke in Berkshire.\n\nEducated at Reading School and at Winchester College, Henry Vansittart joined the society of the Franciscans, or the \"Hellfire Club\", at Medmenham. His elder brothers, Arthur and Robert, were also members of this fraternity.\n\nIn 1745, at the age of thirteen, he entered service of the East India Company as a writer and sailed for Fort St David in Madras. Here he showed himself very industrious, made the acquaintance of Robert Clive and rose rapidly from one position to another, although he spent three years back in England from 1751.\n\nHe returned to India in 1754 and became a member of the Council of Madras in 1757. He helped to defend the city against the French in 1759, and was appointed to replace Clive, on Clive's recommendation, as President of the Council and Governor of Fort William in Bengal in November 1760.\n\nHe arrived in Bengal in July 1760, finding himself in a difficult political position, including a serious lack of funds. He deposed the Nawab of Bengal, Mir Jafar, and replaced the Nawab with the Nawab's son-in-law, Mir Kasim, which increased the influence of England in the province. Vansittart was, however, less successful in another direction. Practically all the company's servants were traders in their private capacity, and as they claimed various privileges and exemptions this system was detrimental to the interests of the native princes and gave rise to an enormous amount of corruption. Vansittart sought to check this, and in 1762 he made a treaty with Mir Kasim, but the majority of Vansittart's council were against him and in the following year this was repudiated. Reprisals on the part of the subadar were followed by war and, annoyed at the failure of his pacific schemes, Vansittart resigned on 28 November 1764 and returned to England.\n\nTo defend his conduct in Bengal, Vansittart published three volumes of papers as \"A Narrative of the Transactions in Bengal from 1760 to 1764\" (London, 1766). His conduct was attacked before the board of directors in London, but events seemed to prove that he was in the right, and in 1769 he became a director of the company. In 1768 he had been elected to a seat in Parliament for Reading.\n\nClive had returned to India and exposed the rampant corruption. Vansittart, Luke Scrafton, and another official, Francis Forde, were sent to India to examine the administrative problems and reform the whole government in India. The mission left England in September 1769, visited Cape Town where they were last reported, embarking, on 27 December 1769, but the ship in which they sailed, the frigate \"Aurora\", was lost at sea, apparently foundered with all hands. The captain had decided to navigate the Mozambique Channel, despite bad weather.\n\nVansittart married Emilia Morse (died 1819), daughter of Nicholas Morse, Governor of Madras, in 1754. They had five sons (Henry, Arthur, Robert, George, and Nicholas), and two daughters, Emilia and Sophie. They resided in England at Foxley's Manor in Bray, Berkshire.\n\nOf the sons:\n\n\n"}

In 1921, he was Paul Ehrenfest's assistant in Leiden.\n\nIn 1925, while at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Breit joined with Merle Tuve in using a pulsed radio transmitter to determine the height of the ionosphere, a technique important later in radar development.\n\nTogether with Eugene Wigner, Breit gave a description of particle resonant states with the relativistic Breit–Wigner distribution in 1929, and with Edward Condon, he first described proton-proton dispersion. He is also credited with deriving the Breit equation. The Breit frame of reference is named after him.\n\nIn 1934, together with John A. Wheeler, Breit described the Breit–Wheeler process. In 1939 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In April 1940, he proposed to the National Research Council that American scientists observe a policy of self-censorship due to the possibility of their work being used for military purposes by enemy powers in World War II.\n\nDuring the early stages of the war, Breit was chosen by Arthur Compton to supervise the early design of the first atomic bomb during an early phase in what would later become the Manhattan Project. Breit resigned his position in 1942, feeling that the work was going too slowly and that there had been security breaches on the project; his job went to Robert Oppenheimer, who was later appointed to scientific director of the entire project.\n\nIn 2014, experimentalists proposed a way to validate an idea by Breit and John A. Wheeler that matter formation could be achieved by interacting light particles (\"Breit–Wheeler process\").\nBreit was Associate Editor of the \"Physical Review\" four times (1927-1929, 1939-1941, 1954-1956, and 1961-1963).\n\nHe was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1964.

I was bored of playing keyboards so I started playing guitar, and Alana just drums however she wants.\" They deliberately chose not to have a regular bass guitarist, according to Craig Mathieson of \"The Age\" this indicates \"they've shown a disdain for convention.\" They performed under a different name each night – they might trick regular customers into thinking they were a new band instead of the same \"shitty\" one. In January 2004 they first performed as the Grates; at Ric's bar in Brisbane. Subsequent noise restrictions limited live performances at the venue, Patterson recalled \"It’s pathetic. Ric’s is our favourite place to play in Brisbane... We played our first couple of shows there about a year ago and miss playing there terribly.\" According to Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, \"They name the Pixies and Weezer as influences.\" Whereas Tammy la Gorce of \"AllMusic\" opined their early material were \"Ramones and Yeah Yeah Yeahs-influenced songs.\"\n\nLater in 2004 they sent a rough demo, \"Trampoline\", to national youth radio station, Triple J, which was accompanied by a hand-written biography and press release. They had recorded it as an 8-track recording using two cheap microphones in Patterson's shed; it received high rotation on Triple J. Mathieson described the single as \"a kinetic pop mantra where Hodgson skewers alternative rock's predilection for sultry female vocalists.\" \"Trampoline\" was used for a Just Jeans \"Shortcuts\" TV ad. During 2004 they toured supporting Rocket Science, the Tremors, TISM and then Regurgitator.\n\nThe band has a distinctive style. In their early years their live set would be written at rehearsal, \"Hodgson often composed the lyrics on the spot, initially more interested in the melody than the words.\" All three members have a background in art and they design their own album artwork, posters, T-shirts and even socks. In April 2005 Hodgson explained her song writing style, \"My attitude used to be just make up some shit that fits in and we'll be sweet, but now I want to work on the lyrics... I think when Daniel Johns first got some success, he didn't really know about music history, so he studied it, but I don't feel like I need to know. I just pick up stuff as we go along.\"\n\nThey issued a run of limited edition extended plays: \"The Grates\", (2002), \"Crocodile\" (2003), \"Black Dog Black Dog\" (2004), \"Pyrate Kids\" (2004) and \"Ssh\" (2004). They released a four-track EP, \"The Ouch. The Touch.\", on Dew Process, on 14 February 2005. Patterson commented on the EP, \"They’re getting pressed and printed though, so we won’t have to slice all the covers by hand!\" It was issued in the United Kingdom two months later via Captains of Industry. Kathryn Kernohan of \"FasterLouder\" felt it was \"a perfect taster... you couldn’t ask for a stronger selection of tracks. It gives an indication of how good you’d be live, and it leaves me hanging out for an album.\" \"The Ouch. The Touch\" peaked in the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In 2005 appeared at the Big Day Out, Meredith, Splendour In The Grass, Falls Festival and Homebake. They supported the Go! Team on their tour over late 2005 to early 2006.\nOn 8 April 2006 they released their debut album, \"Gravity Won't Get You High\", which peaked at No. 9 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was recorded in Chicago with Brian Deck (Holopaw, Iron and Wine, Josh Ritter) producing. Nimmervoll noticed that \"Some songs had been with them for a long time, others were wtitten just days before going into the studio.\" It was released in the UK and the United States in June. Nate Dorr of \"PopMatters\" opined that it provided \"an infectious variety... At times, there's a sense of catchy frivolity to the proceedings, but it can easily be forgiven... sheer excitement of hearing such unbridled enthusiasm in an emerging talent. And they are talented.\" \"Pitchfork\"s Sean Fennessey felt \"electric Hodgson, who sounds like she's riding a jet-fueled pogo on almost every song, is joined by guitarist John Patterson and drummer Alana Skyring, who make a sweet, playful style of basement band music. Occasionally it steers straight, but it mostly just zooms rudderless.\"\n\nThe lead single, \"19 20 20\", was released in March as a 7\" vinyl and a music download. It was followed by \"Silence Is Golden\" (September 2006), which reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 60. The third single, \"Rock Dogs\", was issued later that year. Four of the album's tracks were listed in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006: \"Lies Are Much More Fun\" (No. 71), \"Inside Outside\" (No. 42), \"Science is Golden\" (No. 17) and \"19 20 20\" (No. 10). During 2006 they performed at the Big Day Out (Australian leg), headlined a national tour in the first half of the year, supported Sleater-Kinney on their Australian tour, supported the Zutons on their UK tour, supported the Young Knives, and then Arctic Monkeys in their tours of Australia.\n\nOn 13 October 2006 they performed at the Forum Theatre, Melbourne, which was issued as a live DVD, \"Til Death Do Us Party\", on 30 April 2007. Mess+Noise's Ben described how Hodgson's \"a genuine livewire, swanning across the stage in a flouncy white dress, all red-cordial energy and child-like abandon. But her voice, in a live setting, is a tuneless thing. The harmonies and the melodies of the recording just aren’t there.\" He felt that Patterson's guitar work is \"bare too, skipping between clangy clean sounds and high-school-band distortion\" while Skyring's \"drums are solid, in the Meg White style, but she still looks like the whole thing – her, being here, behind these drums, and all those people, out there, pogoing – is a surprise.\"\n\nThe Grates second album, \"Teeth Lost, Hearts Won\", was released on 2 August 2008, which peaked at No. 6. According to the Dwarf.com website's reviewer it \"needs good set of speakers and an appropriate setting to really be appreciated. When you have seen a band like this live, the expectation is that they will try and capture some of that vibe – and for some reason – unless this sucker is played loud, the vibe is totally lost.\" Its lead single, \"Burn Bridges\", was released in July 2008, which reached the top 100. It was followed by \"Aw Yeah\" (October 2008). The Grates were listed onto the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008 with three tracks: \"Burn Bridges\" (No. 34), \"Aw Yeah\" (No. 80) and \"Carve Your Name\" (No. 83).\n\nIn mid-2009 the Grates travelled to New York where they performed and continued song writing for six months. Skyring left the band in 2010 to study a baking course at Institute of Culinary Education, New York; initially the Grates continued as a two piece with Hodgson and Patterson writing tracks together in that city. Skyring later joined Neil and Sharon Finn's group, Pajama Club.\nLocal US musician, Ben Marshall, joined the band on drums in New York to finish recording their third album, \"Secret Rituals\" (17 June 2011), which peaked at No. 11. Matt Shea of Mess+Noise felt it was \"a little like a ledger of artistic assets: for the band to come out on top, the final statement needs to show a positive balance of improved songwriting over receding whacked-out style.\" The Alphabet Pony's reviewer found the work had \"benefited from this increased sensibility, and the time taken to marinate in the creative hub of Brooklyn has done wonders for their revitalised sound... It's classic Grates sound, brought kicking and screaming into 2011 – but it's in the conflict between the old stuff and the new stuff that's the killer.\" Marshall toured with the band in Australia in June to July on the Secret Rituals tour with auxiliary member, Miranda Freeman on bass guitar and keyboards. Freeman is Hodgson's former high school mate.\n\nThe Grates premiered its lead single, \"Turn Me On\", on Triple J in April 2011 and it was streamed on their official Facebook page. Marshall was also on their Summer's Breath tour later that year in October and November. On the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2011, \"Turn Me On\" was listed at No. 54. Marshall left the Grates in 2012 due to commitments back in the US. The Grates took a hiatus from live shows soon after, to focus on the opening their cafe, bar Southside Tea Room. Their new drummer, Ritchie Daniell, who also drums for Brisbane indie rock band The Trouble with Templeton, officially joined The Grates in 2013 to play their live shows.\n\nThe Grates issued their fourth studio album, \"Dream Team\" (December 2014), on their own label, Death Valley. Everett True of \"The Guardian\" described how it \"sounds more 'grown up' – what with the hyper-energetic brat-pop Grates of old switched for something a little more refined, more radio-friendly – there are still enough moments of euphoria to lift it above the mundane.\" He was disappointed by its \"solid, muscly bloke drumming... Not everything has to be treated like it's an anthem.\" It did not reach the ARIA top 100, although it appeared on the ARIA Digital Albums top 50 and debuted at #48 on the Australian iTunes chart.\n\nIn May 2012 Hodgson and Patterson opened Southside Tea Room, a bar and cafe, located at Morningside. It has received positive reviews and also hosts special events: markets, gigs, and craft tutorials. Daniell initially worked as a barista at the cafe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1988988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1988988", "title": "Lupin Airport", "text": "Lupin Airport\n\nLupin Airport was an airport located at Lupin Mine, Nunavut, Canada that was operated by Echo Bay Mines Limited. The airport closed sometime after the mine closed in 2005, but the runway is still present on the property.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s this area was known as Contwoyto Lake. Nearby (at location 65 degrees 29' 12.61\"N, 110 degrees 21'1.33\"W) is an island where there was a small (four person) camp operated by Pacific Western Airlines of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (since merged with Canadian Pacific Airlines, subsequently bought by Air Canada). Operating expenses for the facility were paid for by the Canadian Federal Government. The island was unofficially known as Alcatraz Island and the smaller one West of it was called Wolf Island.\n\nDuring the 60s there was a Quonset hut for living quarters and a small shed which housed a diesel generator, a backup generator, fuel, and a small tractor. There was no official landing strip, just a dirt strip for emergencies. Planes landed on the lake using floats in the summer and skis in winter. There was a very short emergency strip on land, but it was really too short for safety. The main function of the station was to operate a radio beacon (sending WO in Morse Code for radio-location purposes) and a secondary but very important function was to radio weather observations hourly to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Lupin Mine was an operating gold producer under its owner, Echo Bay Mines.\n\nThe mine itself was entirely constructed out of materials flown into the airport, primarily on a cold-war era Hercules C130 that the mining company had obtained for that specific purpose. Once the mine was up and running, the company replaced the Hercules with a converted Boeing 727 commercial jetliner. The Boeing had been converted to operate as a combination cargo and passenger craft. The typical flight carried the aircrew, miners and contractors. The cargo was usually a very large load of diesel along with the parts, equipment and other supplies needed to operate the mine.\n\nEdmonton and Yellowknife were the primary logistical support centers for the mine. Supply and personnel flights into the Lupin Airport usually originated in Edmonton. A stopover for refueling normally occurred at Yellowknife and it could happen on the way to or from the mine. By this time the landing strip had been upgraded and lengthened to support the landing and takeoff requirements of a 727. The Hercules used to build the mine apparently worked fine on the original dirt strip, and it did so until the runway was upgraded.\n\nThe upgraded runway had a gravel base and it was maintained with graders and snow removal equipment for year-round operation. It also had modern (for the time) navigation equipment and it operated as a fully operational airport complete with metal detectors and baggage handling facilities. Besides supporting the mine, during this period the airport was also an emergency landing strip for other aircraft operating in Canada's far north. To support emergency operations, the commercial jet operated by the mining company was also used to bring parts and other supplies for stranded or damaged aircraft.\n\nAs a precaution against an emergency landing, or worse, a crash in sub-zero arctic weather, passengers going to the airport were also required to bring extreme weather clothing on board. This clothing was treated as personal luggage and was stored during flight in the overhead compartments where it was available for immediate retrieval in the event of an emergency. The requirements included a proper arctic parka with a hood, full size winter boots and mittens. Gloves were of course allowed, but mittens were required. The aircraft also carried significant emergency supplies to support crash survivors if need be. Fortunately, and mostly due to the experienced professionals who made up the Echo Bay air service, these measures were never needed. Considering the amount of diesel fuel that was typically on board, this was especially fortunate. But the extreme clothing requirements were quite a surprise to first time visitors who were accustomed to air travel elsewhere.\n"}

Although Nanisivik Mine closed in September 2002 the airport was in operation until 2011 and served the community of Arctic Bay. This was due to the small size of Arctic Bay Airport. However, on January 13, 2011, First Air transferred all scheduled air services to Arctic Bay's newly expanded airport.\n\nThe airport was about directly southeast of Arctic Bay but the road between them is and a one way taxi fare was $40.00.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, CBC News reported that Canadian Forces documents showed plans to convert the site into a naval station. The plan, which would turn the former mine's existing port into a deepwater facility, would cost $60 million and it was expected that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would make an announcement during his stop in Resolute.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced construction of a new docking and refueling facility in Nanisivik for the Canadian Forces, in an effort to maintain a Canadian presence in Arctic waters during the navigable season (June–October). The choice for Nanisivik as a site was partially based on its location within the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage, and as there is an existing deep-water berthing facility at the site, and a \"jet-capable\" airstrip nearby.\n\nDetailed planning for the project began in August 2007, with environmental studies and assessments will be being carried out in the summer of 2008. Construction at the site is expected to begin in the summer of 2010, with early operating capability available in 2012. The facility was planned to be fully operational by 2015, but now delayed until at least 2018.\n\nThe re-opening of the Nanisvik Airport is unlikely to be needed as a helicopter pad is planned for the naval station site. However the old runway is not marked with a X and could be used as an emergency landing strip.\n"}

It is one of the northernmost airfields in Canada to receive scheduled passenger airline service (Grise Fiord Airport, which is served from Resolute, is the northernmost airport with airline service in Canada while Alert Airport is the northernmost airport in Canada and the world).\n\nThe airport has served as a major transportation hub in the Canadian Arctic. Today the airport is an important refuelling stop for aircraft passing through to other places in the high Arctic such as CFS Alert, Eureka and Mould Bay. Unlike some airports in Nunavut, Resolute is equipped with an ILS precision landing system, allowing for large commercial aircraft operations. The VOR/DME is located atop a hill near the airport. The airport is not equipped with radar, however during 2011's Operation Nanook, a temporary radar installation was used for the duration of that exercise.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force is considering a major expansion of the airport to transform it into a key base for Arctic operations. The expansion would include a paved runway, hangars, fuel installations and other infrastructure.\n\nThe site would provide logistics for search-and-rescue operations according to a December 2011 briefing from the Arctic Management Office at 1 Canadian Air Division.\n\nKenn Borek Air also operates charter flights.\n\nHistorically, the airport was served by several airlines operating direct, no-change-of-plane scheduled passenger jet service from such Canadian cities as Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Yellowknife. Airlines included Canadian Airlines, Nordair, Pacific Western and Transair. Jet aircraft operated in the past in scheduled service into the airport included Boeing 727-100 and Boeing 737-200 jetliners. First Air also operated scheduled jet service with Boeing 727-200 as well as with Boeing 727-100 and 737-200 aircraft in the past.\n\nNordair was serving Resolute in 1964 with Douglas DC-4 prop aircraft with twice weekly flights from Montreal Dorval Airport via intermediate stops in Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq), Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit) and Hall Beach. In 1968, Nordair was operating nonstop service from Montreal twice a week with Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation propliners with the southbound Constellation flights to Montreal making an intermediate stop in Frobisher Bay with the airline also operating twice weekly Douglas DC-4 service to Montreal at this time via en route stops in Frobisher Bay and Hall Beach. Pacific Western Airlines was serving Resolute by 1969 with Douglas DC-6B service flown once a week with this flight operating a routing of Edmonton - Yellowknife - Cambridge Bay - Resolute. By 1970, Nordair had introduced Boeing 737-200 jet service direct to Montreal Dorval Airport with three flights a week being operated via a stop in Frobisher Bay.\n\nAccording to the February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG), three airlines were flying scheduled passenger jet service into the Resolute Bay Airport at this time: Nordair operating Boeing 737-200 flights twice a week from Montreal Dorval Airport via an intermediate stop in Frobisher Bay, Pacific Western Airlines operating Boeing 727-100 flights twice a week on a routing of Calgary International Airport - Edmonton International Airport - Yellowknife - Resolute, and Transair (Canada) operating Boeing 737-200 flights once a week from Winnipeg via an intermediate stop in Churchill, MB.\n\nThe September 15, 1994 OAG listed two airlines flying scheduled jet service into the airport at that time: Canadian Airlines (which formerly operated as CP Air) operating direct Boeing 737-200 flights from Edmonton twice a week and also twice a week direct from Montreal, and First Air operating direct Boeing 727 flights from Ottawa once a week in addition to nonstop 727 flights from Yellowknife once a week. Canadian Airlines flights from Edmonton International Airport made intermediate stops in Yellowknife and Cambridge Bay while its flights from Montreal Dorval Airport made intermediate stops in Iqaluit and Nanisivik. The First Air service from Ottawa also made intermediate stops in Iqaluit and Nanisivik. The OAG indicates that Canadian and First Air were both operating combi aircraft versions of their respective Boeing jets on their flights into the airport with these aircraft being capable of being flown in mixed passenger/freight configuration and also listed local flights into Resolute from Grise Fiord, Nanisivik and Pond Inlet operated by Kenn Borek Air with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL capable turboprop aircraft.\n\nOn 20 August 2011, First Air Flight 6560, a Boeing 737-200 charter flight transporting eleven passengers from Yellowknife, crashed while approaching the airport. Out of the fifteen people aboard, three passengers survived the crash; the four crew members perished. The extreme magnetic variation in the area was cited as a contributing factor to the crew's errors leading to the crash.\n\nOn 12 June 1968, a Fairchild F-27J operated by Great Northern Airways crashed on approach to the airport. There were no fatalities.\n\nOn 15 March 1951, an RCAF C-54 crashed on approach. There were no fatalities.\n"}

{"id": "1989003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989003", "title": "Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company", "text": "Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company\n\nCooper Tire & Rubber Company is an American company that specializes in the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of replacement automobile and truck tires, and subsidiaries that specialize in medium truck, motorcycle and racing tires. With headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, Cooper Tire has 60 manufacturing, sales, distribution, technical and design facilities within its worldwide family of subsidiary companies. In July 1960, the company became a publicly held corporation and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nCooper owns the UK-based Avon Tyres brand, which produces tires for motorcycles, road cars and for motor racing.\n\nThe company slogan is \"The tire with two names ... the company and the man who built it.\"\n\nThe earliest corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Manufacturing Company, founded in 1914 in Akron, Ohio by John F. Schaefer and Claude E. Hart, who were related by marriage. Their new company produced tire patches, tire cement and tire repair kits. They purchased The Giant Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, a tire rebuilding business, in 1920, and in 1922 moved the business to Findlay, Ohio, at a site at the intersection of Lima and Western avenues that is still occupied by Cooper Tire, adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facility. The Cooper name originates from 1919 when Cincinnati auto-parts dealer I. J. Cooper formed The Cooper Corporation in Findlay, to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in 1946.\n\nThe Cooper oval trademark with the Cooper Knight headgear was first registered and used in 1941. In those early years of the brand's identification, the logo also included a banner proclaiming the tires' \"armored-cord\" construction. The company's red, white, and blue logo would become one of the most easily recognized emblems in the tire industry.\n\nDuring World War II the company, known as Master Tire and Rubber, manufactured pontoons, landing boats, waterproof bags and camouflage items, inflatable barges, life jackets and tank decoys, as well as tires, to supply the Allied forces. The U.S. government recognized the company's contribution to the war effort in a 1945 ceremony bestowing the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award (for excellence). Soon after the war (1946) the company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1982, Cooper Tire was headed by a member of the Brewer family: first W.B. Brewer, then his sons, Wayne and Edward. Another son, Robert, was a vice president. W.B. Brewer took Cooper Tire public, and on July 11, 1960, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CTB,\" the \"B\" standing for \"Brewer.\" Throughout their tenure, the Brewers set a tone for hands-on leadership, management mingling with workers, and taking care of them. They built the trust and loyalty of the workers.\n\nUnder the Brewers' leadership, Cooper Tire grew significantly. By 1983, the company joined the ranks of Fortune 500 companies as one of the largest industrial companies in the United States.\n\nIn 1997, Cooper purchased Avon Tyres Ltd., based in Melksham, England.\n\nThe company's largest growth acquisition occurred in 1999 when it bought The Standard Products Company, which increased Cooper's total workforce by 10,000 employees. Dearborn, Mich.-based Standard Products produced sealing, plastic trim and vibration-control systems for the automotive original-equipment industry worldwide. The purchase included Standard Products subsidiaries Oliver Rubber Company and Holm Industries Inc. Oliver Rubber manufactured tread rubber and equipment for the truck-retread industry. Holm produced seals for home and commercial refrigerators.\n\nIn December 2003, Cooper agreed to a joint venture with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, to construct a tire-manufacturing plant near Shanghai.\n\nIn January 2005, Cooper agreed to purchase 11% of South Korea-based Kumho Tires Company, and also announced the formation of a new commercial division encompassing both Oliver Rubber Company and commercial tires.\n\nIn October 2005, Cooper announced an agreement to obtain 51% ownership in China’s third largest tire manufacturer, Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Passenger Tire Company Ltd., and Cooper Chengshan (Shandong) Truck Tire Company Ltd., to produce truck and passenger car tires for mainland Chinese and export markets. Two of the businesses of the joint venture are Cooper Chengshan Passenger Tire, and Cooper Chengshan Tire. In 2007 Cooper set up a manufacturing venture in eastern China with Kenda Rubber Industrial Company, a company based in Taiwan. Cooper generates 25% of its global sales in China. In 2007 Cooper sold its Oliver Rubber Company subsidiary, which produced tread rubber and retreading equipment, to Michelin for $69 million.\n\nIn December 2011, Cooper bought a unit of the Serbian tire manufacturing company Trayal Corporation from Kruševac, from the Bulgarian company Brikel EAD for a sum of $13 million and invested as much as $50 million. The newly established company which has disintegrated from the Trayal Corporation, was named \"Cooper Tire & Rubber Company Serbia\" d.o.o. As of 2016, it has around 740 employees and annual revenue of $76 million.\n\nOn June 12, 2013, a deal was finalized in which Apollo Tyres of India would buy Cooper for $2.5 billion. This move would have made Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. the only major U.S. tire manufacturer. Cooper is the second largest U.S.-based tire company, after Goodyear. On December 30, 2013 Apollo pulled out of the deal since Cooper has not disclosed vital information about its lack of control over its Chinese business. The Chinese plant went on an indefinite strike against the proposed acquisition forcing Apollo to try to lower the $35-per-share bid in the original deal.\n\nCooper Tires produces Cooper branded tires for passenger cars, light trucks, sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks.\nIn 1997, the tire business of Avon Rubber PLC of Melksham, Wiltshire, in the United Kingdom was sold to Cooper. This left Avon able to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products, and protective equipment. Cooper Tire remains a major employer in central Melksham.\n\nIn addition to Avon, Cooper Tire manufactures tires under the associated brand names Dean, Mastercraft, Mickey Thompson, Roadmaster, and Starfire.\nCooper Tire formerly manufactured all tires sold under the Sears Guardsman brand at Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores. Cooper manufactures tires for Discount Tire Company under the Arizonian brand name, and Futura Tires for Pep Boys.\nCooper Tire also manufactures Hercules branded tires in Findlay, Ohio. Cooper tires can be purchased at many tire retailers, like Tire Discounters, Pep Boys, Discount Tire, and more.\n\nAvon, then part of Avon Rubber PLC, was involved in Formula One in the 1950s (1954 and from 1956 to 1959), then in 1981 and 1982.\n\nCooper became the official tire of the A1 Grand Prix, dubbed the World Cup of Motorsports, for the series' initial 2005–06 season and was under contract to produce slick tires and treaded rain tires for the series championship until 2008.\n\nSince 1982, Avon Tyres had been the sole supplier for the British Formula Three Championship. From the 2009 season onwards, these were re-branded \"Cooper\" as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor, and will be until the end of the 2014 season at least. Avon Tyres was also the exclusive supplier for the FIA Formula Two Championship when revived in 2009 to 2012.\n\nIn April 2010, Cooper/Avon Tyres presented a written proposal to Formula One Team Association (FOTA) to be the official tire supplier for the 2011 Formula One season. This was ultimately rejected and Pirelli became the official tire supplier for 2011 onwards.\n\nIn the United States, Cooper became the official tire of the Champ Car Atlantic Championship in 2007. Cooper became the official tire of the IMSA Prototype Lites series (formerly IMSA Lites) in 2010. Cooper Tires is the official supplier of the Mazda Road to Indy formula ladder: USF2000 (since 2010), Pro Mazda (since 2013) and Indy Lights (since 2014).\n\nAs of 2014, Cooper is the official supplier of the FIA World Rallycross Championship. The Americas Rallycross Championship also uses Cooper Tires.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, it was announced that Avon Tyres would be the primary kit sponsor for Championship side Derby County for the 2017/2018 season.\n\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cooper announced that the Road to Indy Presented by Cooper Tires will proceed through virtual races using racing simulation platform by iRacing.\n\nCooper has 10,540 employees as of its 2016 annual report.

In 1524 he went to the mother cloister in Bologna, from where he briefly attended courses in Hebrew and rhetoric at the University of Bologna. In 1525 he was sent by his congregation to the Monastery of Sant' Antonio di Castello in Venice, where, due to his expertise in biblical languages and humanist textual criticism, he was placed in charge of the monastery's library, donated to the canons by Cardinal Domenico Grimani. Many of the collection's biblical, Hebrew, and philosophical works had once been owned by Pico della Mirandola.\n\nPolemics against early Protestants\n\nOver the next several years (1529–33) Steuco wrote a series of polemical works against Luther and Erasmus, the latter of whom he accused of helping to foment the Protestant Revolt against the Church. These works show Steuco's staunch support of the traditions and practices of the Church, including a strident defense of papal authority. Part of his output during this period included a major set of annotations on the Pentateuch, titled \"\", in which he used Hebrew and Greek manuscripts from the Grimani Library to correct Jerome's Vulgate translation of the Old Testament text. When explaining the text, he never strayed from the literal and historical meaning. An interesting juxtaposition to this work of humanist biblical exegesis was a syncretic philosophical work that he wrote in this period, to which he gave the title \"Cosmopoeia\".\n\nHis polemical and exegetical works attracted the notice of Pope Paul III, and in 1538 the pope made Steuco bishop of Chisamo on the island of Crete, and librarian of the papal collection of manuscripts and printed works in the Vatican. While he never visited his bishopric in Crete, Steuco did actively fulfill his role as Vatican Librarian until his death in 1548. While in Rome he authored Old Testament annotations on the Psalms and Job, again relying heavily upon Hebrew sources to help annotate and correct the texts.\n\nDrawing links between Christianity and classical philosophy\n\nIn 1540 he published a major work entitled \"\", which attempted to show that many of the ideas expounded by the sages, poets, and philosophers from classical antiquity were in essential harmony with Christianity. Since Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, this was a common thread in Renaissance thought which spread from Italy to France and Germany, but this was the first book devoted to the subject. Steuco believed that Roman Catholicism, centred on the Gospels, is the true hidden core of pagan beliefs; Theobald Freudenberger commented that \"If a [ancient] passage really refuses to fit into his system, he earnestly addresses the author and admonishes him in a fatherly way to come to his senses.\" This work has a slight polemical edge to it, as Steuco crafted a number of his arguments to lend support to several theological positions that had recently come under question in Italy by reformers and critics of the traditional Catholic faith. His perspective has been described by Maria Muccillo: \n\nAs a Roman humanist, he also took a deep interest in the classical ruins of Rome, and in the urban renewal efforts of Paul III throughout the city. Of particular note in this vein are a series of short orations that he wrote and possibly delivered at the papal court, urging Paul III to refurbish the aqueduct known as the Aqua Virgo, in order to supply Rome with adequate fresh water, and as a major key to the revitalization of the city itself.\n\nIn 1547 Steuco was sent by Paul III to attend the Council of Trent, where he could be counted upon to uphold papal prerogatives and authority. He died in 1548 while in Venice on break from the Council. He is now buried in Gubbio.\n\n\n\n"}

It operated as part of NASA's Earth Observing System. ICESat was launched 13 January 2003 on a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California into a near-circular, near-polar orbit with an altitude of approximately 600 km. It operated for seven years before being retired in February 2010, after its scientific payload shut down and scientists were unable to restart it.\n\nThe ICESat mission was designed to provide elevation data needed to determine ice sheet mass balance as well as cloud property information, especially for stratospheric clouds common over polar areas. It provides topography and vegetation data around the globe, in addition to the polar-specific coverage over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The satellite was found useful in assessing important forest characteristics, including tree density.\n\nThe sole instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), a space-based LIDAR. GLAS combined a precision surface LIDAR with a sensitive dual-wavelength cloud and aerosol LIDAR. The GLAS lasers emit infrared and visible laser pulses at 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths. As ICESat orbited, GLAS produces a series of approximately 70 m diameter laser spots that are separated by nearly 170 m along the spacecraft's ground track. During the commissioning phase of the mission, the ICESat was placed into an orbit which allowed the ground track to repeat every 8 days. During August and September 2004, the satellite was maneuvered into a 91-day repeating ground track for the main portion of the mission.\n\nICESat was designed to operate for three to five years. Testing indicated that each GLAS laser should last for two years, requiring GLAS to carry three lasers in order to fulfil the nominal mission length. During the initial on orbit test operation, a pump diode module on the first GLAS laser failed prematurely on 29 March 2003. A subsequent investigation indicated that a corrosive degradation of the pump diodes, due to an unexpected but known reaction between indium solder and gold bonding wires, had possibly reduced the reliability of the lasers. Consequentially, the total operational life for the GLAS instrument was expected to be as little as less than a year as a result. After the two months of full operation in the fall of 2003, the operational plan for GLAS was changed, and it was operated for one-month periods out of every three to six months in order to extend the time series of measurements, particularly for the ice sheets. The last laser failed on 11 October 2009, and following attempts to restart it, the satellite was retired in February 2010. Between 23 June and 14 July, the spacecraft was maneuvered into a lower orbit in order to speed up orbital decay. On 14 August 2010 it was decommissioned, and at 08:49 UTC on 30 August 2010 it reentered the atmosphere.\n\nA follow-on mission, ICESat-2, was developed by NASA to continue studying polar ice changes, and the biomass and carbon in vegetation. The satellite was launched on 15 September 2018 aboard a Delta II rocket. For the period of time in between the two satellites, NASA's Operation IceBridge used a Douglas DC-8 aircraft as a stopgap to measure ice thickness and collect other data.\n\n"}

{"id": "1989020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989020", "title": "Indeterminate growth", "text": "Indeterminate growth\n\nIn biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth or fruit, or dies.\n\nIn reference to an inflorescence (a shoot specialised for bearing flowers, and bearing no leaves other than bracts), an indeterminate type (such as a raceme) is one in which the first flowers to develop and open are from the buds at the base, followed progressively by buds nearer to the growing tip. The growth of the shoot is not impeded by the opening of the early flowers or development of fruits and its appearance is of growing, producing, and maturing flowers and fruit indefinitely. In practice the continued growth of the terminal end necessarily peters out sooner or later, though without producing any definite terminal flower, and in some species it may stop growing before any of the buds have opened. \n\nNot all plants produce indeterminate inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates the development of new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a \"'determinate\" inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the terminal flower blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side buds develop lower down. One type of example is Dianthus another type is exemplified by Allium and yet others by Daucus.\n\nIn zoology, indeterminate growth refers to the condition where animals grow rapidly when young, and continue to grow after reaching adulthood although at a slower pace. It is common in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and many molluscs. The term also refers to the pattern of hair growth sometimes seen in humans and a few domestic breeds, where hair continues to grow in length until it is cut.\n\nSome mushrooms – notably \"Cantharellus californicus\" – also exhibit indeterminate growth.\n\n"}

In both the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Prose Edda\", the squirrel Ratatoskr carries messages between the unnamed eagle and Nidhöggr, the wyrm that resides below the world tree. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the birds.\n\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Grímnismál\", the god Odin (disguised as \"Grimnir\") says that:\n\nThe eagle is again attested in chapter 16 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", yet here with the company of Veðrfölnir. In the chapter, Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High what other notable facts there are to know about Yggdrasil. High responds (\"Veðrfölnir\" is here anglicized as \"Vedrfolnir\"):\n\nJohn Lindow points out that Snorri does not say why a hawk should be sitting between the eyes of an eagle or what role it may play. Lindow theorizes that \"presumably the hawk is associated with the wisdom of the eagle\" and that \"perhaps, like Odin's ravens, it flies off acquiring and bringing back knowledge\".\n\nHilda Ellis Davidson says that the notion of an eagle atop a tree and the World Serpent coiled around the roots of the tree has parallels in other cosmologies from Asia, and that Norse cosmology may have been influenced by these Asiatic cosmologies from a northern route. On the other hand, Davidson adds, some Germanic peoples are attested as worshipping their deities in open forest clearings, and that a sky god was particularly connected with the oak tree, and therefore \"a central tree was a natural symbol for them also\".\n\n\n"}

Ramsey fought in the Revolutionary War, and was a member of the Congress of the Confederation.\n\nRamsey was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He was the elder brother of David Ramsay, though the brothers spelled their name differently. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1767 and then read law. He settled in northeastern Maryland, and was admitted to the bar in Cecil County in 1771. Ramsey was married to Margaret Jane Peale, known to her family as Jenny, about 1771. Margaret Jane Peale Ramsey often followed the Continental Army following the Battle of Brooklyn. \n\nMargaret died in 1788. Ramsey remarried in 1790 to Charlotte Hall, daughter of Colonel Aquilla Hall (1727 - 1779), a prominent citizen of Harford County, Maryland.\n\nHe was the brother-in-law of artist Charles Willson Peale, who is best remembered for his portrait paintings of leading figures of the American Revolution and for establishing one of the first museums in the United States.\n\nRamsey was a delegate to the Maryland Convention (the revolutionary assembly) in 1775. In 1776 he joined the Continental Army as a captain in Colonel Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, and went north in time to see action in the Battle of Long Island in August. In December he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the 3rd Maryland Regiment. He led them in the defense of Philadelphia in 1777.\n\nAt the Battle of Monmouth, in June 1778, Ramsey was asked by General Washington to stop the British advance after General Lee's initial retreat, and gain time for Washington to rally his other troops. He did so, but his regiment took heavy casualties. Ramsey himself was seriously wounded, left for dead, and taken prisoner. By the time he was exchanged, his regiment had gone south with General Nathanael Greene's forces. He returned to Maryland, and his only remaining military role was in recruiting. He retired from the army on January 1, 1781, and resumed the practice of law in Cecil County.\n\nRamsey moved to Baltimore, Maryland in 1783, and practiced law there. He represented Maryland in the Congress of the Confederation in New York in 1786 and 1787. He was a Federalist, and after the establishment of the Federal government in 1789, President Washington appointed him the first U.S. Marshal for the District of Maryland, with his offices in Baltimore. He held this post from 1790 to 1798. In addition, he was named as Port Captain for Baltimore, serving from 1794 until his death in 1817.

The main draw to the series were the insect-like \"Aura Battlers\", used by the population of Byston Well to fight their wars. These fighting suits are powered by a powerful energy called \"aura\" or \"life energy.\" Certain people are strong enough with the aura-energy to act as power-supply to these mecha, making them Aura Warriors.\n\nThe series aired on Nagoya TV from February 5, 1983 to January 21, 1984, totaling for 49 episodes. There was a three-episode anime OVA sequel, New Story of Aura Battler Dunbine (also known as The Tale of Neo Byston Well) released in 1988.\n\nThe series was later dubbed by ADV Films and was released to DVD in North America, along with the original Japanese version in 2003. However, it quickly became out of print, and until 2018, was only available as a digital purchase from the now-defunct Daisuki site, then Sentai Filmworks licensed the series.\n\nThe series followed Shō Zama, as he suddenly finds himself pulled to the world of Byston Well during a vehicular incident with one of his rivals. Byston Well is located in another dimension located between the sea and the land, and is populated with dragons, castles, knights, and powerful robots known as Aura Battlers. Once Shō is discovered to possess a very powerful \"aura\", he is drafted into the Byston Well conflict as the pilot of the lavender-colored Dunbine.\n\nAs in other Tomino creations, Dunbine's cast is populated by Nordic-looking military types in elaborate costumes on one side, a young Japanese hero caught in the middle, and freedom fighters on the other side. Beautiful female warriors abound on both sides, and the hero falls for the main female lead. There are romances that cut across battle lines, and the non-stop battles between elaborate fighting craft on land and on the air. Most of the cast pilot Aura Battlers, although there are lots of standard airships, smaller fighters, and large warships as well. Also, in typical Tomino style, a large number of named characters die tragically throughout the series.\n\n\nThe Dunbine characters, mecha, and storyline elements make appearances in quite a few games in the \"Super Robot Wars\" series by Banpresto; most notably the \"first\" series. Banpresto has gone on to make spinoff series taking place in different universes such as the \"Alpha\" series and \"Impact\". However, \"Dunbine\" has made few appearances in these latter titles, but has recently been making something of a comeback, first returning in \"UX\", followed almost immediately after by \"Operation Extend\" and \"BX\". \"T\" gives the most recent use of the story.\n\nThe Dunbine units have also appeared in the Another Century's Episode series. In the first sequel, Another Century's Episode 2, many more units from the Dunbine series are included compared to the amount in the first game, and they have a very large part in the plot.

The next day, the Marauder confronts the group, using a unique Pokéball called a Dark Ball, to brainwash Celebi and uses its immense powers over nature to encase it in enormous draconian-like armour made from the forest. Jessie is captured; the Marauder admitting he plots to overthrow Team Rocket’s leader Giovanni and conquer the world. Ash, his friends, and Suicune battle to rescue Celebi from the Marauder’s influence.\n\nAsh, Sam, and Pikachu breach Celebi’s armour and convince it to resist the Marauder, regaining his memories and is freed from the Dark Ball’s influence. The Marauder and Jessie tumble in the lake as Celebi’s armour collapses.\n\nHowever, upon taking Celebi to the lakeside, it dies in Sam’s arms. The group attempt to revive it when Suicune purifies the lake, but it fails. Just as all hope of reviving Celebi is lost, the Voice of the Forest, which is actually each Celebi from across time, materializes in the sky and magically resurrects their brother. Suddenly, the Marauder appears and kidnaps Celebi, using a jetpack to escape, but Ash and Pikachu rescue Celebi, the Marauder crashing into the forest and is confronted by Towa, Diana, White, and the angry wild Pokémon.\n\nCelebi takes Sam back in time, who promises to reunite with Ash in the future. Team Rocket reunite in the lake whilst, the Marauder’s freed Pokémon go their separate ways. Ash, Misty, and Brock speak to Professor Oak of their adventure, Ash saddened by Sam’s departure. However, Professor Oak reassures him that friendships can withstand the test of time and he and Sam will remain friends. However, upon ending the call, the trio are perplexed about how Professor Oak knew Sam’s name, having never mentioned it. In his laboratory, Oak owns Sam’s sketchbook, revealing he is the same character. During the end credits, Tracey Sketchit discovers Oak’s sketchbook and inserts it into a bookshelf for safekeeping.\n\nNorman Grossfeld, the producer of the English adaption, said that the animation quality in the film was the \"finest yet\" from Oriental Light and Magic. The animators felt \"tremendous pressure\" that their adaption, both in the writing and the casting, held up against \"this incredible achievement\". Grossfeld says they adjusted the casting so that the guest characters did not sound too \"cartoony\" – \"and instead had a larger than life tone to fit in with the epic nature of this story and the craftsmanship of the animation\".\n\n\"Pokémon 4Ever\" was successful in Japan, where it grossed .\n\nIn the United States, it earned $717,061 in its opening weekend, ranking #18 on the box office for that weekend. Because the first three films had made $31 million, $19 million, and $8 million respectively in their opening weekends, the film ultimately ended up a box office bomb. However, much like the next film, it was successful upon its release on video and DVD. The film earned a total of $1,727,447 during its run in North America. The film had a 58-day theatrical run, ending on December 5, 2002.\n\nThe film also grossed $79,642 in the Netherlands, bringing its overseas gross to . The film's total worldwide gross was .\n\n\"Pokémon 4Ever\" received generally negative reviews from television critics. Some critics called it \"predictable\" and \"disappointing\", while others stated that \"the viewers won't be disappointed\". The film received a 14% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with 32 of a total 37 reviews being determined as negative, the lowest of the Pokémon film series (original), with the consensus reading, \"Only for diehard Pokemon fans\". It received a rating of 25 out of 100 (signifying \"generally negative reviews\") on Metacritic from 16 reviews. In a review of the film, Dann Gire of the \"Daily Herald\" said that \"nothing feels more desperate than a movie that tries to extort emotions from young viewers. That happens in the animated \"Pokémon 4Ever\", in which colorful characters stand around crying over the shriveling corpse of a magical creature called Celebi. The movie has emotional warmth of tin foil, mainly because it never establishes connections among the characters, or between the characters and viewers\".\n\nTenley Woodman of the \"Boston Herald\" said that \"\"Fans 4Ever\" would be a more appropriate title for the film because \"Pokémon\" enthusiasts likely will be the only ones satisfied by the fourth big-screen installment of this Japanimation craze\". He added that \"the story line is solid, with \"Pokémon\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s proxy-fighter premise pieced together for first-time viewers. However, the film lacks the spark needed to make it a must-see flick\". Robert Koehler of \"Variety\" said that the \"script by Hideki Sonoda is thin in terms of levels of action and adventure, and suffers from last minute padding with one ostensible ending following another. A clever notion to pop up in the larger \"Pokémon\" epic, however, is the suggestion that The Professor (the Pokémon trainers' long-term, reliable guide to all things Pokémon) is actually Sam, now grown up in the present\". He then added: \"Yank voices – holdovers all from the past films – remain as irritating and overly emphatic as ever\".\n\nLoren King of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film a generally positive review, saying: \"The latest installment in the \"Pokémon\" canon is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two, likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokémon graze in peace. The backdrop provides a welcome respite from the ear-, eye- and mind-numbing Pokémon action. And the time-travel plot, though less than inspired, is still tolerable enough for adults accompanying kids\". He added that \"like most \"Pokémon\" tales, this one offers lots of exposition and clunky dialogue, but also counters the expected mayhem with a sweet-sided story about friendship and peaceful creatures who prefer to live far from the madding crowd\". Angel Cohn of \"TV Guide\" said in his review that \"the story is a bit predictable and the characters given to restating the obvious (presumably for the benefit of very young viewers), but overall this third \"Pokémon\" sequel is surprisingly entertaining, and a mystery surrounding Sammy's identity provides an interesting twist. The film's flat, traditional anime aesthetic is perfectly suited to the look of the bold, cartoon-like creatures, though the animators switch to a more CGI-influenced look for portions of the final battle sequence. While well done, these scenes feel jarring and out of sync with the rest of the film. Quibbles aside, children and adults enamored of all things \"Pokémon\" won't be disappointed\".\n\n"}

The area encompasses the location in which Kansas City was first founded. The market name comes from its large open air farmers' market, the southern section of which was the public square in the mid 19th century.\n\nIt derives its \"\"Westport Landing\"\" name because it was the dock on the Missouri River for the exchange of goods going to the community of Westport three miles to the south on higher ground that was operated by John Calvin McCoy. McCoy was to lead a group of settlers to create the \"Town of Kansas\" in the neighborhood in 1850 which in turn became the \"City of Kansas\" in 1853.\n\nThe Quay name was applied to the neighborhood in the 1970s by developer Marion A. Trozzolo to capitalize on the neighborhood's early French connections as a fur trading post operated by François Chouteau of the powerful Chouteau clan starting in 1821. Trozzolo's vision was to make this neighborhood a destination for restaurants and bohemian shops.\n\nThe City Market area when previously known as River Quay, was the site of many mob activities, including car bombs and more.\n\nThe large riverfront warehouses have become increasingly developed into residential lofts, restaurants, bars, shops, cafes, and ethnic markets.\n\nSince its inception in 1857, the City Market continues to be one of the largest and most enduring public farmers' markets in the Midwest, linking growers and small businesses to the Kansas City community.

This is an alternative to the direct deposit of tax payments into Treasury accounts with Federal Reserve banks.\n\nThere are two types of TT&L accounts: 80% of TT&L accounts clear tax payments overnight, the remainder (note option) accounts receive Treasury funds for longer periods of time.

Management of the supply of reserves within the system is critical to ensuring that interbank payments clear on a daily basis. Because tax payments to the government reduce the amount of reserves in the banking system, the TT&L program provides a buffer for system reserve management, preventing reserve shortfalls on heavy tax payment days which would threaten the ability of banks to settle their payment obligations (ATM transaction and cheque clearing).\n\nNote option banks, which retain TT&L funds for longer periods, are free to use those funds in any way allowed for deposits, which includes investing them.

{"id": "1989064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989064", "title": "Al-Ma'arri", "text": "Al-Ma'arri\n\nAbū al-ʿAlāʾ al-Maʿarrī (, full name , also known under his Latin name Abulola Moarrensis; December 973 – May 1057) was a blind Arab philosopher, poet, and writer. Despite holding a controversially irreligious worldview, he is regarded as one of the greatest classical Arabic poets.\n\nBorn in the city of Ma'arra during the Abbasid era, he studied in nearby Aleppo, then in Tripoli and Antioch. Producing popular poems in Baghdad, he nevertheless refused to sell his texts. In 1010, he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health, and continued writing which gained him local respect.\n\nDescribed as a \"pessimistic freethinker\", al-Ma'arri was a controversial rationalist of his time, citing reason as the chief source of truth and divine revelation. He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as \"a double prisoner\" of blindness and isolation. He attacked religious dogmas and practices, was equally critical and sarcastic about Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism, and became a Deist.\n\nHe advocated social justice and lived a secluded, ascetic lifestyle. He was a vegan, known in his time as moral vegetarianism, entreating: \"do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught /\nfor their young\". Al-Ma'arri held an antinatalist outlook, in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and suffering of life.\n\nAl-Ma'arri wrote three main works that were popular in his time. Among his works are \"The Tinder Spark\", \"Unnecessary Necessity\", and \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\". Al-Ma'arri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Ma'arrat al-Nu'man. In 2013, a statue of al-Ma'arri located in his Syrian hometown was beheaded by jihadists from the al-Nusra Front.\n\nAbu al-'Ala' was born in Ma'arra, modern Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, Syria, near the city of Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, during the Golden Age of Islam. He was a member of the Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Ma'arra, belonging to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Ma'arra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.\n\nHe lost his eyesight at the age of four due to smallpox. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life he regarded himself as \"a double prisoner\", which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.\n\nHe started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Ma'arra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE, when al-Ma'arri was still a child. Al-Ma'arri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his \"Risālat al-ghufrān\". Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, al-Ma'arri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.\n\nIn 1004–05 al-Ma'arri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Ma'arri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Ma'arra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.\n\nHe remained in Ma'arra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict moral vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town. In that incident, al-Ma'arri went to Aleppo to intercede with its Mirdasid emir, Salih ibn Mirdas, to release his brother Abuʿl-Majd and several other Muslim notables from Ma'arra who were held responsible for destroying a winehouse whose Christian owner was accused of a molesting a Muslim woman. Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area. Al-Ma'arri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.\n\nAl-Ma'arri was a skeptic in his beliefs who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion. This, along with his general negative view on life, has made him described as a pessimistic freethinker. One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of reason against the claims of custom, tradition, and authority. Al-Ma'arri taught that religion was a \"fable invented by the ancients\", worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses.\n\nAl-Ma'arri criticized many of the dogmas of Islam, such as the Hajj, which he called \"a pagan's journey\". He rejected claims of any divine revelation and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic, for whom reason provides a moral guide, and virtue is its own reward.\n\nHis religious scepticism and positively antireligious views extended beyond Islam and included both Judaism and Christianity, as well. Al-Ma'arri remarked that monks in their cloisters or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality: if they were born among Magians or Sabians they would have become Magians or Sabians. Encapsulating his view on organized religion, he once stated: \"The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains.\"\n\nAl-Ma'arri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works. He opposed all forms of violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, he decided not to sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.\n\nIn al-Ma'arri's later years he chose to give up consuming meat or any other animal products. He wrote:\nAl-Ma'arri's fundamental pessimism is expressed in his antinatalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him over the loss of a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life:\n\nAl-Ma'arri's self-composed epitaph, on his tomb, states (in regards to life and being born): “This crime was by my father done -To me, but never by me to one.\".\n\nAl-Ma'arri is controversial even today as he was skeptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab world. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of al-Ma'arri during the Syrian civil war. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.\n\nStill, al-Ma'arri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet Lucretius, calling them progressive for their time.\n\nAn early collection of his poems appeared as \"The Tinder Spark\" (\"Saqṭ al-zand\"; ). The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the Hamdanid ruler Sa'd al-Dawla. It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet. A few poems in the collection were about armour.\n\nA second, more original collection appeared under the title \"Unnecessary Necessity\" (\"Luzūm mā lam yalzam\" ), or simply \"Necessities\" (\"Luzūmīyāt\" ) . The title refers to how al-Ma'arri saw the business of living and alludes to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used.\n\nHis third famous work is a work of prose known as \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" (\"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" ).\nThe work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom al-Ma'arri mocks for his religious views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find salvation.\nBecause of the aspect of conversing with the deceased in paradise, the \"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" has been compared to the \"Divine Comedy\" of Dante which came hundreds of years after. The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn Shuhayd's \"Risala al-tawabi' wa al-zawabi\", though there is no evidence that al-Ma'arri was inspired by Ibn Shahayd nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by al-Ma'arri. Algeria reportedly banned \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" from the International Book Fair held in Algiers in 2007.\n\n\"Paragraphs and Periods\" (\"Al-Fuṣūl wa al-ghāyāt\") is a collection of homilies. The work has also been called a parody of the Quran.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1989067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989067", "title": "Agunah", "text": "Agunah\n\nAn agunah (, plural: agunot (); literally \"anchored\" or \"chained\") is a Jewish woman who is stuck in her religious marriage as determined by \"halakha\" (Jewish law). The classic case of this is a man who has left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is MIA. It is used as a borrowed term to refer to a woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her a divorce (which requires a document known as a \"get\").\n\nFor a divorce to be effective, \"halakha\" requires that a man grant his wife a \"get\" of his own free will. Without a \"get\", no new marriage will be recognized, and any child she might have with another man would be considered a \"mamzer\" (illegitimate). It is sometimes possible for a woman to receive special dispensation from a \"posek\" (\"halakhic\" authority), called a \"heter agunah\", based on a complex decision supported by substantial evidence that her husband is presumed dead, but this cannot be applied if the husband is clearly alive.\n\nBecause of the difficulty for women in such situations, it has been a task for every generation of halakhic authorities to try to find halakhically acceptable means to permit such women to remarry. In the past it was not uncommon, due to the danger of travel and primitive means of communication, for people leaving home never to be heard of again; consequently rabbis often had had to deal with this issue. Over the past few centuries, thousands of responsa have been written to deal with cases of agunot.\n\nIn the past most \"agunah\" cases were due to a husband dying without leaving clear evidence of his demise, or becoming mentally ill (insane). Nowadays many \"agunah\" cases arise as a result of a husband withholding a \"get\", perhaps seeking a more favorable divorce settlement, or out of vindictiveness. In response \"agunah\" groups have organized to support these women and try to find a solution to this problem. Various remedies have been proposed, but as yet, no one solution has common acceptance. Nevertheless, the Jewish prenuptial agreement is one remedy which is in use in Modern Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate \"halakhic\" authorities.\n\nCircumstances leading to a woman being declared an \"agunah\" are:\n\nA woman who is denied a divorce from her husband is not considered an \"agunah\" until her husband refuses an order by a \"beth din\" (rabbinic court) to give her a \"get\".\n\nWhat constitutes a legitimate request for a divorce is based on halakhic considerations and the particular case of the couple. See \"Mesorevet get\" below.\n\nIn modern and ancient times, warfare has been a major cause of women being declared \"agunot\" (plural of \"agunah\"), as (especially in ancient times) soldiers are often killed with no one knowing. Many efforts have been made to resolve this problem in accordance with \"halakhic\" principles, including issuing a provisional \"get\" that only goes into effect if the husband does not return by a specified date. During World War II, some American Jewish and other chaplains provided combat soldiers with a \"provisional \"get\"\", which only goes into effect if the husband is missing in action, leaving his wife an \"agunah\". This practice is based on the Talmudic declaration that King David did not commit adultery when lying with Bathsheba (see II Samuel 11), since all of his soldiers (including Bathsheba's husband) gave a \"provisional \"get\"\" to their wives before leaving for battle. This practice can raise \"halakhic\" issues, especially for Kohanim (members of the priestly class). Since they are forbidden from marrying divorcees, were they to end up returning safely after the date the provisional \"get\" went into effect they would be unable to remarry their wives.\n\nBecause of the serious nature of adultery in Jewish law, an \"agunah\" is forbidden to marry another man, regardless of the circumstances, whether accidental or malicious, that left her an \"agunah\" in the first place, or the amount of time that has passed since she first became an \"agunah\". A child born from another man to an \"agunah\" is considered a \"mamzer\" (illegitimate), and may only marry another \"mamzer\" or a convert.\n\nBecause of the dire situation of the \"agunah\", every effort is made to release her from her marriage. This can be done in three ways:\n\nAccording to most rabbis, reasonable circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the death of the husband, and no direct testimony is required. This is based, among other things, on the talmudic assertion: \"The Rabbis taught: 'If he fell into a lion's den, <nowiki>[bring witnesses to] testify [that he is dead]</nowiki>, if he fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions - <nowiki> [there is] no [need] to testify [that he is dead]</nowiki>'\". In other words, if it is known that the man fell into a ditch of snakes and scorpions and did not come out, it can be assumed that he is dead, and there is no need for further evidence (unlike falling into a lion's den where there is still a slight chance of survival). If, however, it is later discovered that the husband is not dead, the woman will find herself in particularly bad circumstances: her children from her second marriage will be considered \"mamzerim\", and she will be forced to divorce both her first and second husbands, subject to the \"halakhic\" ruling that an adulterous woman \"is forbidden to her husband and the man with whom she fornicated\". While such situations are extremely rare under normal circumstances, they did occur in the aftermath of the Holocaust and also occurred frequently in the wake of pogroms and other forms of persecution.\n\nFinding a flaw in the marriage ceremony is considered to be a last resort in releasing an \"agunah\". It is rarely used as it is typically difficult to find actual cause in most marriages sufficient to invalidate them retroactively. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the \"agunah\", efforts are made to identify reasons why one of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and the marriage ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that the woman did not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the \"halakhic\" authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize a marriage that was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a \"halakhic\" ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.\n\nAt the 1998 Jerusalem \"Agunot Conference\", Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative Movement, explained the four approaches taken by leaders of Conservative Judaism to find remedies for the problem of the \"agunah\".\n\nThe first, beginning in the 1950s, was the inclusion of the Lieberman clause in the \"ketubah\" (marriage contract). Named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, the clause requires that a \"get\" be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. While most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of the separation of church and state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civil court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.\n\nThe second approach fell into the category of conditional marriages, \"t'nai b'kiddushin,\" and was based in part on past approaches used by both the French and Turkish rabbinates—but, according to Rabinowitz—had improvements gleaned from lessons learned from those past experiences. The \"ketubah\" was not changed, but a separate pre-marital agreement was signed, and in the presence of the rabbinical court, the prospective groom read it, and the prospective bride stated that she agreed to it. The agreement was that the parties understood that if a civil divorce were ever granted, then a get must be delivered within six months of that date. A refusal to abide by that agreement would give the court no choice but to consider the original marriage, and the original declaration of the groom, so flawed that it would be as if that marriage never occurred.\n\nThe third approach, using contacts both within Judaism and external to it, was to coerce the recalcitrant husband to grant a get. One example cited at the conference was a case where the civilly-divorced husband planned to remarry, this time to a Catholic woman in a Catholic religious ceremony. The Conservative movement's Bet Din contacted the Catholic Church, which agreed to refuse to have the marriage performed until the previous marriage was religiously dissolved, resulting in the almost immediate granting of the get by the husband.\n\nFinally, in 1968, by a unanimous vote of the law committee, the final approach was initiated, when it was decided that the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative Movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of \"hafka'at kiddushin\". According to Rabinowitz, just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get.\n\nThere is a long history of concern for the agunah on the part of Orthodox rabbis, and a number of proposals have been put forth for consideration by religious leaders. So far, no solution has been found that satisfies most orthodox religious leaders.\n\nA number of modern papers and conferences have continued to discuss both issues and possible solutions, including the possibility of a modern \"takkanah\" (religious legislative enaction), to empower the Chief Rabbinate of Israel to intervene to annul marriages retroactively, in a way that was possible for some time during the Middle Ages. Such proposals are considered too radical—and not legally permissible (in terms of halakha) -- by most orthodox leaders.\n\nHowever, as studies and discussions continue, a number of modern works and conferences have referenced the work of past Orthodox rabbis, such as Ya'akov Moshe Toledano, who recommended in 1930/31 that every Jewish marriage be made contingent on the \"continuing agreement\" of the local rabbinic court, so that the court could retroactively annul the marriage as a remedy to the agunah problem; and Mnachem Risikoff, who recommended in 1937 that such consideration be given not to every local court, but at least to the Jerusalem rabbinical court, specifically recognizing that authority in the words recited under the \"chuppah\" (wedding canopy). Risikoff, among others, also proposed a discussion of the reinstatement of the Biblical status of the pilegesh, a relationship status between man and woman that does not require a Get upon dissolution, thereby avoiding the category of agunah.\n\nOther approaches that have been discussed by religious leaders, including leading Orthodox rabbis, have included the possibility of prenuptial agreements, not incorporated into the ketubah or mentioned in the words recited by the groom during the ceremony, through which the husband and wife agree to abide by orders of a designated Beth Din, regarding the giving or acceptance of a get. Jechiel Perr discussed such a proposal, and it has been reported that Moshe Feinstein, looked upon this idea with favor. Additionally, discussions have considered the possibility of various forms of coercion that could be applied to the husband, to compel him to grant the \"get\".\n\nNo proposal has so far met with wide approval on the part of the Orthodox rabbinate, although there have been some cases of individual rabbis taking what has been viewed as \"maverick\" individual action, including the convening of rabbinic courts to annual marriages, using the Geonic model. Such actions have been widely condemned within the orthodox community.\n\nIn 2012 the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF), an organization of (as of 2012) 150 Modern Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution saying that, \"IRF Rabbis may not officiate at a wedding unless the couple has signed a halakhic prenuptial agreement. IRF Rabbis are further encouraged to participate ritually only in weddings in which the couple has signed a halakhic prenuptial agreement. Ritual participation includes but is not limited to reading the \"ketubah\", serving as a witness, and making one of the \"sheva berachot\"\". By 2019, the vast majority of Modern Orthodox rabbis took the same approach.\n\nA related case is that of a woman whose husband has died childless: in such a situation, the husband's brother is required by Jewish law to enter into \"yibbum\" (a kind of levirate marriage) with the widow so as to have children with her in the name of the deceased. The brother can refuse to do \"yibbum\" and instead perform a ceremony known as \"halizah\" to release her from her bond to him (in modern times \"halizah\" is nearly always performed instead of \"yibbum\"). If the brother is missing, or if he is still a child, the woman is required to wait until he is located or has reached adolescence so that he can perform the \"halizah\" ceremony. There have been recorded cases of the husband's brother trying to blackmail the widow by delaying the \"halizah\" ceremony, effectively leaving her as an \"agunah\".\n\nIn 1947 David Ben-Gurion acceded that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed in recognition of this decision (among other matters). This agreement is known as the \"status quo letter\". In 1953 the Knesset enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953. Section 1 of the Law states, \"Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts.\" The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: \"Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law\" (din torah).\n\nIn 2007 the Chief Rabbinate found that in Israel men and women were refused divorce in equal numbers, 180 women and 185 men over a two-year period. The Director-General of the Rabbinical Courts said this showed that \"the claims by women's organizations of thousands of women whose husbands refuse to give them divorces have no basis in reality\". Nevertheless,\n\n\"A woman suffers more in this situation, as she is Biblically forbidden to marry again; and children she might bear to another man would be considered \"mamzerim\" according to \"halakha\". A man is similarly not permitted to marry before being divorced, but the ban is much less severe (because monogamy was instituted by one single overreaching authority in Europe in around the year 1000 CE, and was accepted in Europe among the (Ashkenazim), whereas Sefardic and Mizrahi (Eastern) Jewish communities did not formally accept monogamy only until very recently, after aliyah to Israel in 1950's onward.) This considered, a man's future children will not be considered illegitimate.\"\nIn 2015 Tzohar (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israeli Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a \"get\"; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.\n\nIn 2018 the Knesset passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel's rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.\n\nA \"mesorevet get\" is a Jewish woman who is a victim of \"get refusal\", and is known as a modern-day \"agunah\".\n\nAccording to \"halakha\", a \"get\" is only valid when it is given by a husband to his wife of his own free will. However, under certain circumstances pressure may be applied on a husband to force him to grant a divorce to his wife. Where a woman has proven one or more of a list of particular grounds for divorce, the beth din (rabbinical court) may apply pressure on the husband in these situations. There are some \"halakhic\" decisors who would act accordingly in the cases of abuse or neglect. Nevertheless, not under all circumstances is a wife entitled to demand a divorce according to \"halakha\". If a wife who is not \"halakhically\" entitled to a divorce does demand one, she may not be considered as a \"mesorevet get\" by a rabbinical court. However, not any woman who wants to leave an unwanted marriage but is refused by her husband, is considered to be a victim of \"get\" refusal. There are opinions that deem a woman's repugnance for her husband as acceptable \"halakhic\" grounds for coercion. \"It is said: In cases of granting a \"get\" to a woman, the man is forced until he says, 'I wish to do so'\". Nevertheless, in almost all cases, it is required to leave the man some say in the matter, lest the \"get\" be considered a \"coerced divorce\", which is halakhically invalid. As ruled by \"Rabbeinu Tam\", pressures that can be exerted against the man include shunning, denying him communal benefits and honors, and in extreme cases even imprisonment. Legend has it that as a last resort where all else has failed, a tactic has been sparingly used in the past, to let him spend a night near a nameless grave, or to frighten him in some other way.\n\nStarting in the mid 1980s, the New York divorce coercion gang employed violent tactics such as kidnapping, beating and torture to extort \"gittin\" and money from husbands in troubled marriages. They were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013, and sentenced to prison. In 2016, another rabbinical team was arrested on suspicion of planning the contract killing of a husband in order to free his wife.\n\nIn Israel, rabbinical courts are allowed by law to implement various measures to persuade a man to grant his wife a \"get\" (Rabbinical Courts Law [Enforcement of Divorce Rulings] 5755-1995). These sanctions are a modern-day version of the aforementioned, \"Harchakot D'Rabeinu Tam,\" which include: revoking of a driver's license, closing of bank accounts, revoking professional licenses such as medical and legal, cancellation of a passport, and incarceration. Practically, one of the most effective of these has turned out to be revoking a recalcitrant husband's driver's license. Even so, neither the laws nor the Israeli Rabbinical Courts' enforcement, or lack thereof, have succeeded in eliminating \"get\" refusal in Israel. In the Diaspora, the rabbinical courts have no such powers, and any practical power that they may wield would be the product of a binding arbitration agreement (such as Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal), if signed previously by the combating couple. Within the past decade, both Orthodox rabbinical groups and women's organizations have decried the increasing number of cases of \"get\" refusal, as well as establishing task forces to deal with the issue and to help individual victims of \"get\" refusal.\n\nMany women's groups feel that rabbinical courts fail to use all the measures at their disposal to force men to grant their wives a \"get\", thereby allowing a vengeful husband to blackmail his wife for years. Public criticism of the courts, as well as demonstrations, have been attempted to influence particularly notorious cases.\n\nSeveral solutions have been proposed to help women who are denied a \"get\":\n\nIn 1995 the Israeli parliament gave the rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men who refuse to give their wives a \"get\" by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning those who do not comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's groups say the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases.\n\nIn 2004, Justice Menachem HaCohen of the Jerusalem Family Court offered new hope to \"agunot\" when he ruled that a man refusing his wife a \"get\" must pay her NIS 425,000 in punitive damages, because \"[R]efusal to grant a \"get\" constitutes a severe infringement on her ability to lead a reasonable, normal life, and can be considered emotional abuse lasting several years.\" He noted that \"[T]his is not another sanction against someone refusing to give a \"get\", intended to speed up the process of granting a \"get\", and this court is not involving itself in any future arrangements for the granting of a \"get\", but rather, it is a direct response to the consequences that stem from not granting a \"get\", and the right of the woman to receive punitive damages.\" This ruling stemmed from the Public Litigation Project initiated by the advocacy organization Center for Women's Justice as one of a number of successful lawsuits filed in Israeli civil courts claiming financial damages against recalcitrant husbands.\n\nIn 2007, an Israeli survey revealed that there only 180 cases of refusing-get husbands including 69 documented \"agunah\" cases. In contrast, there are 190 cases in which the wife refuses to give the husband a divorce.\n\nOutside Israel, an \"agunah\" could obtain a civil divorce and remarry via civil marriage, as non-Israeli legal systems generally do not recognize the \"agunah\" status. Nevertheless, an \"agunah\" would not typically pursue a second marriage, since her first marriage is still valid according to halakha, any other sexual relationships would constitute adultery from her first husband. Furthermore, according to halakha, any children born by an agunah are considered \"mamzerim\".\n\nIn 2014 the Rabbinate of Uruguay instituted the requirement for all Jewish couples that marry under its auspices to sign a rabbinic prenuptial agreement. The agreement states that in the case of the couple divorcing civilly, the husband is obligated to immediately deliver to his wife a get. The initiative was launched by Sara Winkowski, a director of the Kehila, the Comunidad Israelita del Uruguay (Jewish Community of Uruguay), who is also a Vice President of the World Jewish Congress and longtime activist for the rights of women within Jewish law.\n\nIn a 2020 landmark case in London, a woman obtained a \"get\" after launching a private criminal prosecution against her husband for \"controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate of family relationship\" contrary to section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015. This was submitted on the basis that her husband had kept her in an intimate relationship against her will. The criminal prosecution was dropped when the husband relented and provided the \"get\" rather than face the prospect of a substantial prison sentence.\n\nAgunah Day was established by ICAR - The International Coalition for Agunah Rights - in 1990, to raise public awareness to the plight of the Agunah and galvanize action to solve the problem. It is observed on the Jewish calendar date of the Fast of Esther.\n\nThe Fast of Esther was chosen by ICAR as Agunah Day in order to symbolize identification with the Agunah for two contrasting reasons – due to affliction and due to salvation. Like Esther, the \"agunah\" of the present era does not want to be in the marriage in which she finds herself. Like Esther, many women who are refused a get live in fear of their spouses and live a double life. Like Esther, the \"agunah\", a victim of get-refusal, finds herself lacking control of her own freedom.\n\nThe Torah allows a man to have multiple wives, and a child born to a married man with a single woman is not considered to be a \"mamzer\". Thus, while a woman who enters a new relationship while married suffers severe halachic consequences, a man doing the same suffers much lighter consequences. However, in the beginning of the 11th century, Rabbenu Gershom issued a decree prohibiting Jewish men from practising bigamy (though this was not accepted by certain remote Jewish communities such as the Yemenite Jews). To prevent this decree from causing flippant divorces previously unnecessary, Rabbenu Gershom also decreed that \"a woman may not be divorced against her will.\" These decrees made it possible for men to become \"agunim\" just as women become \"agunot\", if his wife should disappear or refuse to accept a get.\n\nTo resolve the situation of such a man, the \"heter meah rabbanim\" (exemption by one hundred rabbis) was established, to permit him to take a second wife (after depositing a \"get\" for the first wife with the rabbis). However, it is alleged that many husbands do not succeed in obtaining a \"heter meah rabbanim\", and thus remain chained to their wives. There are more cases in which women choose not to accept a \"get\" when a husband wants to give one, than cases in which the man refuses to grant a \"get\". \n\nThere are also cases where the \"get\" is offered to protect the wife. For example, if the husband is undertaking a dangerous activity, or is being imprisoned for a lengthy time, he may wish to divorce entirely to help his wife by freeing her. Often, such offers are refused.\n\nIn Karaite Judaism, a woman can claim a divorce. If a man refuses to give divorce to his wife, the \"beth din\" may exercise its legal power to grant a divorce instead. Consequently, there are no \"agunot\" in Karaite Judaism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1989085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989085", "title": "Whitney Young Memorial Bridge", "text": "Whitney Young Memorial Bridge\n\nThe Whitney Young Memorial Bridge is a bridge that carries East Capitol Street across the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. in the United States. Finished in 1955, it was originally called the East Capitol Street Bridge. It was renamed for civil rights activist Whitney Young in early 1974. The bridge is long, its six lanes are wide, and it has 15 spans resting on 14 piers.\n\nThe need for a new bridge spanning the Anacostia River was first identified in 1949 after worsening traffic at Barney Circle led to widespread citizen complaints. The bridge was proposed to cross the Anacostia by extending East Capitol Street over the river. This bridge was opposed by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission (NCPPC), which asked that a bridge be built by extending Massachusetts Avenue SE through the undeveloped Hill East/Reservation 13 area and connecting it with its namesake street in the Greenway neighborhood on the east side of the river. The Commission was supported by an influential group of business people and civic leaders known as the Committee of 100 on the Federal City. D.C. officials, however, opposed this route for fear of the negative effects it would have on nearby Gallinger Hospital (later renamed D.C. General Hospital). On December 29, 1949, the three D.C. Commissioners (then the sole government of the District of Columbia) approved a bridge at East Capitol Street.\n\nBut just three weeks later, the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge opened across the Anacostia River, alleviating traffic congestion in southeast. A few days later, the NCPPC voted to suspend approval for any new bridge across the Anacostia River until traffic patterns and congestion around the existing bridges were resolved and the need for a new span made clear. Federal engineers said that study would take two months. Members of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Maryland, whose state would be impacted by eastbound traffic from any new bridge, favored the East Capitol Street site and encouraged the D.C. Commissioners to bring the fight to Congress for resolution. In early March 1950, the Subcommittee on District Appropriations of the House Committee on Appropriations turned down a request to fund a study of the Massachusetts Avenue site, and the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments held hearings which supported the D.C. Commissioners. The Subcommittee on the District of Columbia estimated that reconstructing ramps and reconfiguring traffic patterns around existing bridges would cost $9.5 million, while building a new bridge would cost about the same. Federal highway officials also testified that the bridge would help ease access to Maryland Route 214, which was originally planned to connect with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway at the District line but which had been forced into a more southerly direction. Members of Congress inspected both the Massachusetts Avenue SE and East Capitol Street sites, and the House Subcommittee approved the East Capitol span in mid-March 1950.\n\nA $395,000 contract studying the two sites was granted to the J. E. Greiner Company of Baltimore, Maryland, on September 9, 1950. The company was also asked to study whether the approaches from the west to the East Capitol Street span would travel along that street or be divided between Independence Avenue SE and C Street NE. D.C. highway officials gave their approval to the East Capitol Street span on May 1, 1950. The Greiner Co. had recommended a $2.7 million steel plate girder bridge. The bridge was designed to pass under Minnesota Avenue SE and the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad tracks on the east side of the river and connect with Kenilworth Avenue NE. The cost of the eastern approaches was estimated at $6.7 million. The western approaches would split over Kingman Island and connect Independence Avenue SE and C Street NE. Work on the western approaches was estimated at $2.3 million. The NCPPC approved the plan on May 10, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers did so on August 20. But after a final site visit from the NCPPC in September 1951, the approaches were moved slightly westward. The new approaches required dredging from Kingman Lake and replacing it with sand and gravel to create a gently curving peninsula that extended into the western side of the lake. of fill would be used to raise the peninsula above the low water mark, and the western approaches built on the new land.\n\nBids for the entire $12 million construction project were solicited on May 23, 1952. The Arlington, Virginia, firm of J.A. LaPorte Inc. won the dredging contract, and the D.C. firm of Morauer & Hartzell won the fill contract. The work was expected to take 15 months. The NCPPC approved the city's plans to connect the new bridge to Kenilworth Avenue NE on December 13, 1952, and a $5.5 million plan to widen Kenwilworth Avenue into a divided, 10-lane freeway on March 24, 1953. D.C. officials paid $250,000 to buy the land for the exit ramps onto Kenilworth Avenue. Construction on the western approaches was blocked for a month after residents of Suitland, Maryland, (upset by loud trucks passing down their streets) won a month-long restraining order against the project so that contractors could devise and implement a noise-abatement program.\n\nConstruction on the bridge itself began in 1953. Baltimore Contractors, Inc. won the $1.2 million contract to build the bridge's substructure, and DeLuca Davis Construction (also of Baltimore) won the $2.2 million contract to the build the superstructure. District officials sought approval from Congress to spend $4.3 million in District of Columbia highway budget funds in September 1953. The city also applied for $4.2 million in federal matching highway funds to help finish the bridge. Driving of piles for the foundation began in December 1953. About 120 individuals helped construct the bridge deck.\n\nAll the substructure and most up the superstructure had been completed by August 1954. Widening of East Capitol Street east of the river was also completed in 1954. Completion was expected in October 1955. By late September 1954, 73 percent of the superstructure had been completed and only stone protections for the piers remained to be finished for the substructure. District transportation officials also said that ramps and overpasses for the Kenilworth Avenue exits were almost complete by this time as well, but the railroad track underpass (being built by S. Wikstrom Co.) was only 46 percent complete and not due for final work until November 1955. Officials said the bridge would open once Kenny Construction finished connecting the railroad underpass to East Capitol Street in the east.\n\nKenny Construction began work on the final $2.3 million phase of the bridge project on November 6, 1954. Work was due to end in 540 days. The Greenway Apartments (located at 3539 A Street SE) obtained an injunction in February 1955 stopping work for a month on the project after alleging that the excavations for the road would affect the foundation of their building.\n\nThe East Capitol Street Bridge opened on November 10, 1955. Tippy Stringer, a local television personality at WRC-TV (and later the wife of NBC news anchor Chet Huntley), cut the ribbon opening the bridge. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert V. Murray drove the first vehicle across the bridge. About 300 people attended the ceremony, which was held in a driving rain. Also present were all three D.C. Commissioners and Rep. George Hyde Fallon (chair of the House Committee on Public Works).\n\nThe bridge and approaches on the west side were built through what had been planned as Anacostia Park, a recreation area and National Sports Center. Construction of the bridge required redesign of that park, and abandonment of the Kingman Lake feature of the plan. The western approach included an ellipse that was to serve as a parade ground, but by 1957 planners were already viewing it as a stadium site. \n\nIn 1957, the Kenilworth Expressway was constructed to connect the bridge to the new Baltimore-Washington Parkway and along with that eastern approach was changed to include ramps between the two. This project rendered the downstream sidewalk obsolete for more than 50 years. By 1964, the Anacostia Freeway had been extended north to meet the Kenilworth Expressway, which was later subsumed by the freeway. \n\nIn 1961, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (later renamed RFK) opened on the former parade grounds in the western ellipse, parking lots filled the land on both sides of the approach and connections to the parking were built as part of the stadium. \n\nIn early 1974, the East Capitol Street Bridge was renamed the Whitney M. Young, Jr. Memorial Bridge in honor of Whitney Young, an activist during the Civil Rights Movement and National Urban League Executive Director .\nIn 1980, District officials spent $8.5 million reconstructing the deck of the bridge and adding safety improvements. The bridge was carrying about 56,000 vehicles a day at that time. One side of the span was closed at a time, with two-way traffic proceeding on the open portion. Safety improvements included adding a median wall and barriers between the road and the sidewalk and replacing the barrier on the outside of the sidewalk with a higher fence to prevent suicides. It also narrowed the sidewalks to . \n\nThe bridge continued to have work done as it neared a half century of use. The roadway's condition was noticeably rough in 1997, and so in 2004, the District of Columbia resurfaced the deck and made repairs to three piers at a cost of $3.4 million. In 2009, the Federal Highway Administration's National Bridge Inventory rated the bridge as \"not deficient.\" The District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) estimated that by 2015, the bridge would be carrying only about 60,000 vehicles per day—about 10 percent fewer than in 1996.\n\nIn 2019, the District began another rehabilitation project for the bridge. The work includes repairs to both the substructure and the superstructure, rebuilding and widening (to 6 foot 3.5 inches) the sidewalks and their approaches, repair to the bridge rail, installation of new overhead signs and other small repairs. \n\nThe East Capitol Street Bridge saw its first suicide when one-legged 48-year-old Adolphius L. Groom leapt from the bridge on the morning of July 13, 1967. The first major accident on the bridge occurred on March 7, 1969, when two vehicles collided head-on on the span, killing two people. Another major crash occurred on September 18, 1971, when a vehicle on the bridge was rear-ended, killing one of the occupants. In October 1977, a man traveling at high speed across the bridge rear-ended another automobile and died. Another suicide occurred on December 16, 1986, when a man leapt from the bridge and landed on a moving vehicle below. Another traffic fatality occurred on the bridge on November 13, 1986, when a driver struck a disabled vehicle on the bridge and was himself rear-ended by a third car. In February 1990, an ambulance taking a patient to the hospital was struck on the bridge by an automobile traveling at about 100 mph, leaving the driver and passenger in the vehicle in critical condition.\n\nThe bridge was also the scene of a famous rape and murder in D.C. history. On October 1, 1971, Richard Anthony Lee was accused of kidnapping Robert L. Ammidown and his wife, Linda E. Ammidown; forcing them to drive to the East Capitol Street Bridge overpass above the railroad tracks; and raping and killing Linda Ammidown. Police later learned that Robert Ammidown had hired Lee to kill Linda in a plot to inherit her substantial fortune and win custody of their 12-year-old son. Four men who had learned of the plot were attempting to extort money from Ammidown. In separate trials, Judge John J. Sirica found Ammidown and Lee guilty of murder. Ammidown received a sentence of life in prison, but Lee received the death penalty. Eight days after sentence was imposed, the United States Supreme Court held in \"Furman v. Georgia\", 408 U.S. 238 (1972) that death penalty laws in the United States constituted cruel and unusual punishment and thus were unconstitutional. Lee's sentence was changed to life in prison. The Court later upheld new death penalty laws in \"Gregg v. Georgia\", 428 U.S. 153 (1976). The Ammidown/Lee trial was the last death penalty case in the District of Columbia. (The District of Columbia abolished the death penalty in 1981.)\n\nIn 1982, D.C. officials proposed building the Barney Circle Freeway, which would have linked Interstate 695 (which dead-ended at a junction with Pennsylvania Avenue SE) to the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge by building a six-lane freeway from Barney Circle to the bridge through Anacostia Park. The plan would also have built a new bridge across the Anacostia River from Barney Circle to connect with the Anacostia Freeway near E Street SE. After numerous delays and strong citizen opposition, the Barney Circle Freeway project was cancelled in 1997.\n\nA federal report in March 1972 listed the East Capitol Street Bridge as one of several \"deficient\" bridges needing repair in the District of Columbia. D.C. officials disagreed with the report's conclusions, arguing they had not submitted complete data on the bridge.\n\nIn September 2013, United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) rated the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge both \"fracture critical\" and \"structurally deficient\". The \"fracture critical\" rating meant that the if a single component of the bridge fails, the entire bridge would collapse. The \"structurally deficient\" rating meant that at least one major component of the bridge was in \"poor\" condition. DDOT officials said they had reinforced the bridge, but these temporary measures were not enough to cause either USDOT assessment to be lifted. DDOT said it had no means of funding any permanent repairs.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" in April 2014 called the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge one of the three \"busiest deficient bridges\" in the District of Columbia, along with Arlington Memorial Bridge and Key Bridge. DDOT began an extensive program of preventive maintenance to ensure the bridge did not deteriorate further in advance of a planned 2018 major rehabilitation. DDOT said it would inspect the bridge again at the end of 2015 in order to reassess the bridge's condition.\n"}

Its dark color is the result of crude processing methods that leave behind impurities. Despite its name, black tar heroin can also be dark orange or dark brown in appearance. It is generally less expensive than other forms of heroin.\n\nBlack tar heroin is impure morphine diacetate. Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency however is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in homebake heroin in Australia and New Zealand the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass.\n\nBlack tar as a type holds a variable admixture morphine derivatives—predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.\n\nBlack tar heroin is often produced in Latin America, and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the United States, while also being occasionally found in Western Africa. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, from tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.\n\nPure morphine and heroin are both fine powders. Tar's unique appearance and texture is due to its acetylation without benefit of the usual reflux apparatus.\n\nThe assumption that tar has less adulterants and diluents is a misconception. The most common adulterant is lactose, which is added to tar via dissolving of both substances in a liquid medium, reheating and filtering, and then recrystallizing. This process is very simple and can be accomplished in any kitchen with no level of expertise needed.\n\nThe price per kilogram of black tar heroin has increased from one-tenth that of South American powder heroin in the mid-1990s to between one-half and three-quarters in 2003 due to increased distributional acumen combined with increased demand in black tar's traditional realm of distribution. Black tar heroin distribution has steadily risen in recent years, while that of U.S. East Coast powder varieties has dropped; heroin production in Colombia has decreased as U.S.-funded efforts to eradicate Colombian poppy fields continue.\n\nPeople who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher \nrisk of venous sclerosis than those injecting powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible.\n\nThe presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di- acetyl morphine potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine.\n\nBlack tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of \"skin-popping\" or subcutaneous injection predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from \"Clostridium perfringens\", while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with \"Clostridium botulinum\" infection.\n\nIn some parts of the United States, especially the lower states, black tar may be the only form of heroin that is available. Many users do not inject.\n\n\n"}

Luckily for them, their refusal to work was not met by deadly force, but merely deportation back to Sumatra. In the 1780s, thousands of voluntary migrants set sail for Port Louis from Guangzhou on board British, French, and Danish ships; they found employment as blacksmiths, carpenters, cobblers, and tailors, and quickly formed a small Chinatown, the \"camp des Chinois\", in Port Louis. Even after the British takeover of the island, migration continued unabated. Between 1840 and 1843 alone, 3,000 Chinese contract workers arrived on the island; by mid-century, the total resident Chinese population reached five thousand.\n\nThe earliest migrants were largely Cantonese-speaking; but, later, Hakka-speakers from Meixian, further east in Canton (modern day Guangdong), came to dominate numerically; as in other overseas Chinese communities, rivalry between Hakka and Cantonese became a common feature of the society.\n\nIn the late 19th to early 20th century, Chinese men in Mauritius married Indian women due to both a lack of Chinese women and the higher numbers of Indian women on the island. At first the prospect of relations with Indian women was unappealing to the original all male Chinese migrants yet they eventually had to establish sexual unions with Indian women since there were no Chinese women arriving in the country. The 1921 census in Mauritius counted that Indian women there had a total of 148 children fathered by Chinese men. These Chinese were mostly traders.\n\nDuring the 1880s, despite the continuous influx of immigrants, Mauritius' Chinese population declined; Chinese traders, legally unable to purchase land in Mauritius, instead brought their relatives from China over to Mauritius. After training them for a few years to give them a handle on the business and to introduce them to life in a Western-ruled colonial society, the traders sent those relatives on their way, with capital and letters of introduction, to establish businesses in neighbouring countries. For example, between 1888 and 1898, nearly 1,800 Chinese departed from Port Louis with ports on the African mainland—largely Port Elizabeth and Durban—as their destinations. By 1901, the Sino-Mauritian population had shrunk to 3,515 individuals, among them 2,585 being business owners. Until the 1930s, Chinese migrants continued to arrive in Port Louis, but with the strain on the local economy's ability to absorb them, many found that Mauritius would only be their first stop; they went on to the African mainland (especially South Africa), as well as to Madagascar, Réunion, and Seychelles. After World War II, immigration from China largely came to an end.\n\nHowever, Sino-Mauritians continued to maintain the personal ethnic networks connecting them to relatives in greater China, which would play an important role in the 1980s, with the rise of the export-processing zones. Foreign investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the factories they built in the EPZs, helped Mauritius to become the third-largest exporter of woollen knitwear in the world. Along with the investors came a new influx of Chinese migrant workers, who signed on for three-year stints in the garment factories.\n\nToday, most Sino-Mauritians are businesspeople, with a \"virtual monopoly\" on retail trade. After the Franco-Mauritian population, they form the second-wealthiest group on the island. They own restaurants, retail and wholesale shops, and import-and-export firms. Chinese restaurants have greatly influenced Mauritian culture, and Chinese food is consumed all over the island by people of all backgrounds. Fried noodles is one of the most popular dishes. Mauritians from all ethnic origin and background also enjoy the various vegetables and meat balls (Niouk Yen, Sow Mai, Van Yen, Fee Yen) which originate from the Hakka cuisine in Meixian.\n\nIn a 2001 Business Magazine survey, 10 of the 50 largest companies were Chinese owned.\n\nMost Sino-Mauritian youth are at least trilingual: they use Mauritian Creole and French orally, while English—the language of administration and education—remains primarily a written language. In the 1990 census, roughly one-third of Sino-Mauritians stated Mauritian Creole as both their ancestral language and currently spoken language. The other two-thirds indicated some form of Chinese as their ancestral language although only fewer than one-quarter of census respondents who identified Chinese as their ancestral language also indicated it as the language spoken in the home. Few Sino-Mauritian youth speak Chinese; those who do use it primarily for communication with elderly relatives, especially those who did not attend school and thus had little exposure to English or French. None use it to communicate with their siblings or cousins. Among those members of the community who do continue to speak Hakka, wide divergence with Meixian Hakka has developed in terms of vocabulary and phonology.\n\nTwo Chinese-medium middle schools were established in the first half of the 20th century. The Chinese Middle School (华文学校, later called 新华中学 and then 新华学校) was established on 10 November 1912 as a primary school; in 1941, they expanded to include a lower middle school. Their student population exceeded 1,000. The Chung-Hwa Middle School (中华中学), established by Kuomintang cadres on 20 October 1941, grew to enroll 500 students, but by the end of the 1950s, that had shrunk to just 300; they stopped classes entirely in the 1960s, although their alumni association remains prominent in the Sino-Mauritian community. The Chinese Middle School also faced the problem of falling student numbers, as more Sino-Mauritians sent their children to mainstream schools, and in the 1970s stopped their weekday classes, retaining only a weekend section. However, their student numbers began to experience some revival in the mid-1980s; in the 1990s, they established a weekday pre-school section. Most of their teachers are local Sino-Mauritians, though some are expatriates from mainland China.\n\nFour Chinese-language newspapers continued to be published in Mauritius . A monthly news magazine also began publication in 2005. The newspapers are printed in Port Louis, but not widely distributed outside the city.\n\nThe \"Chinese Commercial Gazette\" (华侨商报) was once the largest and most influential Chinese-language newspaper in Mauritius. It stopped publishing in the 1960s, and merged with the \"China Times\".\n\nThe \"Chinese Daily News\" (中华日报) is a pro-Kuomintang newspaper. It was founded in 1932. The rivalry between Beijing-friendly and Taipei-friendly newspapers reached its peak in the 1950s; then-editor-in-chief of the \"Chinese Daily News\", Too Wai Man (杜蔚文), even received death threats.\n\nThe \"China Times\" (formerly 中国时报; now 华侨时报) was founded in 1953.\nThe editor-in-chief, Long Siong Ah Keng (吴隆祥), was born in 1921 in Mauritius; at age 11, he followed his parents back to their ancestral village in Meixian, Guangdong, where he graduated from high school and went on to Guangxi University. After graduation, he signed on with the \"Chinese Commercial Gazette\" and returned to Mauritius. He left Mauritius again in 1952 to work for a Chinese paper in India, but a position at the \"China Times\" enticed him back.\n\nOriginally a four-page paper, the \"China Times\" later expanded to eight full-colour pages.\n\n\"The Mirror\" (镜报) was established in 1976. It is published on a weekly basis every Saturday. At its peak, they had a staff of eight people. Their editor-in-chief, Mr. Ng Kee Siong (黄基松), began his career at the \"Chinese Commercial Paper\" in 1942 at the age of 25. After 18 years there, the paper was forced to shut down. He and a team of fellow journalists founded a paper to replace it, the \"New Chinese Commercial Paper\". It was while working there that he met Chu Vee Tow and William Lau, who would help him to establish \"The Mirror\". Another editor and journalist, Mr. Poon Yune Lioung POON YOW TSE (冯云龙), who studied foreign languages at Tsinghua University, was also solicited to lend a hand. The paper is printed by Dawn Printing, which is currently run by Ng Kee Siong's son David.\n\nMost of \"The Mirror\"'s readers are in their forties or older; it has subscribers not just in Mauritius, but Réunion, Madagascar, Canada, China, Australia and Hong Kong as well. The paper's local readership has been boosted slightly by guest workers from China, but the circulation barely exceeded 1,000 copies in 2001. By 2006, that number had fallen to seven hundred. In 2010, \"The Mirror\" stopped publication.\n\n\"Hua Sheng Bao\" (华声报), also referred to as \"Sinonews\", was founded in 2005. With regards to its editorial line, it is a supporter of Chinese reunification. It began as a daily newspaper solely in Chinese, but then changed to an eight-page format, including one page each of English and French news. It mostly prints Xinhua newswire reports, with the last page devoted to local news.\n\nMost Sino-Mauritians use the full Chinese name of the male head of family or a respected ancestor who led the family as their legal surname, the result of an administrative procedure that had been widely used in British India (e.g. Muthu s/o Lingham) and which was extended to Mauritius, including not just Indo-Mauritians but Sino-Mauritians in its ambit. This practice is not unique to Mauritius; some Chinese in the Philippines and Chinese migrants in the early Soviet Union also adopted such surnames.\n\nThe majority of the Sino-Mauritians are Catholics, a result of conversions during the colonial era. Other Sino-Mauritians are Protestant, Buddhist or Taoist; typically, some syncretism occurs among the latter two, incorporating elements of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and traditional ancestor worship. Sino-Mauritian Christians, especially members of the older generations, sometimes retain certain traditions from Buddhism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Canada, the series aired uninterruptedly on Family Channel and (beginning on 2007) Disney Junior (formerly called Playhouse Disney) until December 31, 2012. The series has also aired in different countries around the world.\n\nThe animated series is based on a series of four environment-themed children's books titled \"Katie and Orbie Save the Planet\", illustrated by Canadian cartoonist Ben Wicks and written by his daughter Susan Wicks, which were published in 1991. In 1993, Lacewood Productions adapted the characters into an animated series which was originally in production until 1996, being revived five years later by Amberwood Entertainment and then ending in 2002. Contrary to the original books, the series isn't strictly environment-themed, having stories that range from having a new pet or helping their friends, to address themes like children with divorced parents, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, one of the few series aimed at preschoolers to do so.\n\nThe theme song was written by Edmund Eagan and performed by his niece, Mireille Eagan.\n\nUnlike most TV series, \"Katie and Orbie\" was animated in a technique referred to by producer Sheldon Wiseman as \"picture-mation,\" similar to an Play-a-sound book, instead of coming to life. Also, none of the characters actually speak, so a variety of cartoonish sound effects are used during the stories, with a narrator telling the story. The series is narrated by Leslie Nielsen.\n\n\nThe family's surname was never mentioned. They also possess a cottage on the shore of a lake (which was bought by Wayne's parents) in which they occasionally spend time, especially in the summer.\n\n\nOntario-based animation studio Lacewood Productions began work on the series in 1993, creating 13 half-hour episodes, which debuted in 1994 on Family Channel and quickly became a success, prompting Lacewood to create two further seasons in 1995 and 1996. In the third season, the series switched to digital ink and paint for coloring.\n\nIn 1997, Lacewood Productions closed down and was taken over by Paragon Entertainment. In 1999, Amberwood Entertainment, a studio founded by Sheldon Wiseman after Lacewood's closure, acquired some of its assets from Paragon, including the series, and alongside Entertainment Rights began production of 26 more episodes, which debuted on the Family Channel the next year. However, in 2002 after the sixth season the series definitely ended production.\n\nA total of 234 individual stories were produced, three per each half-hour episode. Each episode also had two interstitial segments titled \"Did You Know?\" which tells viewers small pieces of information regarding several subjects, such as plants, food, animals, the body and arts. These segments are narrated off-screen by Katie (voiced by Amanda Tripp).\n\nEach episode is structured by the opening theme, the first story, a \"Did You Know?\" interstitial segment, the second story, another \"Did You Know?\" interstitial segment, the third story and the closing credits.\n\nSeasons 1, 4, 5 and 6 were available on DVD on the online store of the now-defunct Canadian retailer Express Media; however, seasons 2 and 3 were not.\n\nTwo DVDs were released in Australia in 2010 with season 6 episodes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1989110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989110", "title": "Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)", "text": "Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)\n\nCelebrity Jeopardy! is a series of sketches that aired regularly on the television comedy/variety show \"Saturday Night Live\" between 1996 and 2002, the years when Will Ferrell was a cast member. It parodies the same-named special event on the television quiz show \"Jeopardy!\" that features competition between notable individuals with all winnings going towards charitable organizations, and significant reductions to the game's level of difficulty. Fifteen sketches aired between December 1996 and February 2015: two sketches per season from 1996 to 2002; and one each in 2005 and 2009, when Ferrell returned to the show as host. The sketch was revived for the \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\" on February 15, 2015.\n\nFerrell portrays \"Jeopardy!\" host Alex Trebek. Darrell Hammond also appeared in each sketch, usually portraying Sean Connery, in an impersonation that typically involves crass insults directed at Trebek. Norm Macdonald appeared as Burt Reynolds in six sketches. Jimmy Fallon also appeared six times, each time portraying a different character.\n\nOn several occasions, \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketches have been referenced during actual episodes of \"Jeopardy!\".\n\nThe sketch often begins at the start of the Double Jeopardy! round. Trebek welcomes the audience and, occasionally, apologizes for an offense or incident that occurred before the break. He then introduces the celebrity contestants and reveals their scores, which are either $0, a negative score, or a very low positive score. Many times, the contestants refuse or fail to select an appropriate category and dollar value from the game board, grinding the game to a halt and often requiring Trebek to choose one himself. As the celebrities' growing ineptitude and disinterest became apparent, the subject matter used for categories shifted from normal topics (such as \"Movies\" and \"Popular Music\") to more childish topics, categories with titles giving not-so-subtle hints as to the correct response without reading the clues (such as \"Famous Oprahs\"), and those requiring no responses whatsoever. Recurring \"Jeopardy!\" category \"Potent Potables\" appears in every sketch but is never selected, and when it finally is chosen, it results in an inadvertently offensive pre-recorded Video Daily Double involving Bill Cosby.\n\nInstead of buzzing in with the correct questions, contestants either give horribly incorrect responses or say things that have nothing to do with the game, frustrating Trebek, who does nothing to hide his contempt for the celebrities' performance. Trebek's mood is also exacerbated by Connery's pranks and antics, which include making sexual jokes at Trebek's expense, deliberately misreading or vandalizing the categories on the board to turn them into sexually suggestive phrases, and implying that he has had sexual relations with Trebek's mother.\n\nTrebek eventually grows exasperated with his inability to conduct the show and cuts it short by moving to Final Jeopardy!. He either discards the scripted category in favor of a much easier task (such as having the celebrities write and respond to their own questions), or announces a childishly simple category. Even though it appears impossible for the celebrities to fail, they invariably do. Connery occasionally provides a correct response, yet uses his wager to transform the text into a rude phrase or drawing. Sometimes Connery appears to have sympathy for Trebek until the wager reveal, which happens to be a rude drawing at Trebek's expense; on an earlier sketch, this is also performed by John Travolta, who in response to a clue asking the celebrities to name their favorite food, responds with \"miso\", an actual soup, yet when Trebek asks for the wager, reveals it to be \"horny\", which is read as \"me so horny\".\n\nTrebek is the beleaguered straight man, and is generally the only person on stage interested in the game. The contestants, who are either unaware of what the game is or uninterested in playing, will ramble incoherently, deliver irrelevant monologues, or openly antagonize the host. Whenever a contestant takes the game seriously, they prove utterly incapable of supplying the correct question. No contestant ever offers a correct response; however, two come close: Phil Donahue and Tony Bennett, who in their respective sketches, offer descriptions for the holiday of Christmas and \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\". When Reynolds, who had initially been the celebrity who appeared on each episode, makes his return appearances, he misreads categories in the same manner as Connery and insists that he be addressed as \"Turd Ferguson\" because he finds that name funny.\n\nAt the end of almost every sketch, all three celebrities have scores in the negative thousands of dollars, and in most cases, a humorous, often sexual, Final Jeopardy! punchline is delivered by Connery. In one of his sketches, Reynolds is declared an unquestioned winner, even though he wins simply because he has the least amount of negative money, rather than actually earning a victory. When Trebek ends the show, he either states that money will not be awarded to charity or announces his intention to resign or commit suicide.\n\nA typical \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch featured three cast members (two as contestants and Ferrell as Trebek) plus that week's host as a third contestant. The thirteenth edition of the sketch (Cosby, Sharon Osbourne, Connery) featured three members of the \"SNL\" cast as the three contestants and Ferrell, now hosting, reprising his role as Trebek. The episode with Connery, Ozzy Osbourne, and Martha Stewart featured cast members in all four roles.\n\n\nThirteen of the fifteen sketches included the episode's host, usually as a contestant. The tenth sketch was one of two not to feature a host, as it was part of an \"SNL\" primetime special that did not feature a guest host. The 40th anniversary special also did not have a host. Both Ferrell and Macdonald were previous cast members who reprised their \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" role upon their return. Notably, two hosts appeared as actual contestants on the real \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\", those being David Duchovny (in 1995 and 2010) and Martin Short (in 2006).\n\n\nNorm Macdonald was inspired to create the first \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" after noting how much easier the questions on the real-life \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" were compared to regular episodes. A fan of the sketch series \"SCTV\", Macdonald acknowledged that his concept would be substantially the same as \"Half-Wits,\" a recurring sketch on SCTV in which Eugene Levy played a parody of Trebek, exasperated by the incredibly dumb contestants on the program. Macdonald called Levy and secured permission to co-opt the premise of the sketch.\n\nDuring the May 2007 special \"Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation\", Macdonald said he created the \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch purely as an excuse to do his Burt Reynolds impersonation. He purposely chose to make Reynolds an anachronism, appearing on stage as if Reynolds was still the same age he was in 1972. Macdonald also claims that Reynolds was a fan of the sketch and that there were talks to do a sketch where the real Reynolds would crash the game and punch out Macdonald. Reynolds would then play the remainder of the game, with his responses being even dumber than Macdonald's. However, Macdonald was fired from \"SNL\" before that sketch could be written.\n\nThe host and contestants are played as caricatures of their real life personalities. Hammond said that, while his initial Connery impression was as accurate as possible, it would eventually morph into a \"bastardization\" of the actor, which audiences—and Hammond himself—found far more entertaining. Though Trebek shaved his trademark mustache in 2001, Ferrell retained it as long as he played the character, even in the twelfth sketch—Ferrell's last episode as a cast member—when a clean-shaven real Trebek made a cameo at the end.\n\nCritical responses to the sketches have been positive. In 2008, Ferrell's portrayal of Trebek was #3 in IGN's \"Top 15 Will Ferrell characters\".\n\n\"Jeopardy!\" host Alex Trebek has mentioned his admiration for Will Ferrell's impression of him in interviews. Trebek also stated that during every taping of the show, he is asked by one of the audience members if he liked Ferrell's impression, and always replies that he does. On several occasions, \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketches have been referenced during actual \"Jeopardy!\" episodes:\n\nIn the May 19, 1999 \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" episode, the Jeopardy! round featured the category \"'S' Words\", and the Double Jeopardy! round featured \"Swords\" in the same column (in the first sketch, wherein \"'S' Words\" is a category, Connery misreads it as \"Swords\"). During the September 5, 2001 episode, the Double Jeopardy! categories were \"Sean Connery\", \"Surprise Me, Trebek!\", \"Therapists\" (misread by Connery as \"The Rapists\"), \"Things You Shouldn't Put in Your Mouth\", \"The Number After 2\", and \"Rhymes With 'Dog'\".\n\nThe June 27, 2006 show featured the category \"Japan-U.S. Relations\", which had been misread by Connery as \"Jap Anus Relations\". In the November 8 and 16, 2006 \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" episodes, categories included \"Surprise Me, Trebek!\" and \"Answers That Start With 'Feb'\", respectively (the latter of which is a reference to the category \"\" from the sketch). On the November 23, 2009 show, the categories in the Jeopardy! round were \"\"SNL\" Celebrity \"Jeopardy!\"\", \"States That End in Hampshire\", \"What Color Is Green?\", \"Current Black presidents\", \"Sounds That Kitties Make\", and \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Word That Rhymes With Star\".\n\nA May 15, 2015 \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" featured \"The Pen is Mightier\", a category about famous authors and their books (which was misread in a \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch as \"The Penis Mightier\" by Connery, who thought it was a penis enlargement product); and on September 16, 2015, a contestant who did not know the actual answer jokingly guessed \"The Love Ballad of Turd Ferguson\" during Final Jeopardy!\n\nThe Jeopardy! round from the July 8, 2016 episode featured the categories \"States That Begin with California\", \"Is That a Hat?\", \"Catch These Men\", \"A Petite Dejeuner\", \"'S' Words\" and \"SNL Cracks Us Up\". On July 10, 2019, the Jeopardy! round featured the category \"An Album Cover\", which Connery reads in a sketch as \"Anal Bum Cover\".\n\nThe category \"Surprise me, Trebek!\" appeared again in the \"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time\" special in 2020. When contestant Brad Rutter picked the category for the first time, he shouted its name in a imitation Sean Connery voice.\n\nThe October 1999 \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketch featuring Sean Connery, Burt Reynolds, and French Stewart was featured in the \"SNL\" Game Show Parodies compilation special from February 2000 and its later home video release. The special was co-hosted by Will Ferrell in character as Alex Trebek alongside Darrell Hammond as then-\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" host Regis Philbin, who was briefly mentioned in the April 2000 \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" installment. Two of the three \"Best of Will Ferrell\" home video compilations would include Celebrity Jeopardy! sketches, including the Connery/Reynolds/Stewart sketch in 2003's first volume and 2005's Connery/Osbourne/Cosby installment in 2010's third volume.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" has parodied \"Jeopardy!\" in other unrelated sketches, such as the futuristic parody \"Jeopardy! 1999\" from October 1976, and the April 1995 sketch \"Gapardy\", featuring The Gap Girls. A recurring sketch in more recent seasons is \"Black Jeopardy!\", which debuted in season 39, and whose clues frequently invoke African American stereotypes. As well, various contestant impersonations, including Connery and Reynolds, have appeared outside of \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketches with the same cast members.\n"}

He published his stories in the journal \"Satyricon\", of which he was also an editor, in the series of \"New Satyricon\", and other publications. He published a total of around 20 books. Averchenko's satirical writings can be described as liberal. After the Russian Civil War, he emigrated to Central Europe and died in Prague.\n\nAverchenko was born on 27 March 1881 in Sevastopol. He was the son of a poor merchant, Timofey Petrovich Averchenko.\nAverchenko completed only two courses at the Gymnasia because of his poor eyesight, which rendered him unable to work on his studies for extended periods. His eye had been damaged by a childhood accident. However, as time went by, his lack of formal education was compensated by his natural intellect, as the writer has described.\n\nAverchenko started to work at the age of 15, employed by a private transport company. He remained there for slightly over a year before pursuing other employment. In 1897 Averchenko left for Donbass to work as a clerk in the Bryansk mine. He worked there for three years and later wrote several stories about life at the mine, including \"In the Evening\" and \"Lightning.\"\n\nIn 1903, at the age of 22, he moved to Kharkiv where his first story appeared in the newspaper \"South Territory\" on 31 October.\n\nDuring 1906 to 1907 he edited the satirical magazines \"Bayonet\" and \"Sword\". Finally in 1907 he was fired from this work, reportedly with the words, \"You are a good man, but suitable for nothing.\" After this, in January 1908 Averchenko left for Saint Petersburg where he was to achieve success in his career.\n\nIn 1908 Averchenko became secretary of the satirical magazine \"Dragonfly\" (later renamed to \"Satyricon\") and in 1913 he became its editor. For many years Averchenko worked successfully as a member of the magazine's staff together with many other notable people, including Nadezhda Teffi, Sasha Chorny, and Aleksey Remizov. His most lauded humorous stories were published in the magazine. During Averchenko's work at the \"Satyricon\" it became very popular, and theatrical works based on his stories were put on by many theatres throughout the country.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1912 Averchenko more than once travelled to Europe with his friends and colleagues at the \"Satyricon\" (including Aleksey Remizov). These travels served Averchenko as a rich source for his creative work, and inspired his book \"Expedition of Satyriconers in Western Europe\" which was published in 1912. Averchenko also wrote many theatre reviews under several pen names.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Averchenko's life was greatly changed. In August 1918 Bolshevik leaders declared the \"Satyricon\" anti-Soviet and suppressed it.\n\nAverchenko and all \"Satyricon\" staff took a negative position against Soviet authority. Averchenko struggled greatly in attempting to return to his own Sevastopol; in particular, he had to travel through the Ukraine, which was being occupied by Germans. Beginning in June 1919 Averchenko worked for the newspaper \"South\" (later the \"South of Russia\") and urged aid for the Voluntary Army.\n\nOn 15 November 1920 Sevastopol was taken by the Reds. Some days before Averchenko had had time to flee via steamer ship to İstanbul.\n\nAverchenko felt comfortable while in İstanbul. There were many other fellow Russian refugees in the city at the time.\n\nIn 1921 in Paris he published a satirical anthology, \"A Dozen Knives in the Back of Revolution\" which Lenin described as \"a book of great talent by the embittered to distraction White Guard.\" He followed this book with a collection of stories, \"A Dozen Portraits in the Boudoir Format\".\n\nOn 13 April 1922 Averchenko moved to Sofia and later moved to Belgrade. Averchenko spent a brief time in both cities before moving again and taking up permanent residence in Prague on 17 June 1922. In 1923 his book of collected emigrant stories, \"The Notes of the Simple-Minded\", was published by the Berlin publishing house Nord.\n\nAverchenko found life away from his homeland and from his native tongue very hard. Many his stories dealt with his feelings of alienation, in particular the story \"The Tragedy of the Russian Writer.\" He took on popularity in the Czech language immediately. His writings have been very successful and many of his stories have been translated into Czech.\n\nWorking for the famous newspaper \"Prager Presse\", Averchenko wrote many effervescent and witty stories, which nevertheless expressed great yearning for his homeland.\n\nIn 1925 Averchenko fell sick after an operation to remove his eye. On 28 January he was moved to the Prague Municipal Hospital with the diagnosis of \"weakness of the heart muscle, distension of the aorta and sclerosis of the kidneys.\" Doctors could not save his life and he died on the morning of 12 March 1925.\n\nAverchenko was buried in the Olšany Cemetery in Prague. His last work was the novel \"The Joke of Maecenas\", written in Sopot in 1923 and published in 1925 after his death.\n\n\n"}

Demos are typically released by the game's publisher to help consumers get a feel of the game before deciding whether to buy the full version and/or keep it.\n\nIn the early 1990s, shareware distribution was a popular method for publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies such as Apogee Software (now 3D Realms), Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games), and id Software. It gave consumers the chance to try a trial portion of the game, usually restricted to the game's complete first section or \"episode\", before purchasing the rest of the adventure. Racks of games on single 5\" and later 3.5\" floppy disks were common in many stores, often very cheaply. Since the shareware versions were essentially free, the cost needed only the covering of the disk and minimal packaging. Sometimes, the demo disks were packaged within the box of another game by the same company. As the increasing size of games in the mid-90s made them impractical to fit on floppies, and retail publishers and developers began to earnestly mimic the practice, shareware games were replaced by shorter demos that were either distributed free on CDs with gaming magazines or as free downloads over the Internet, in some cases becoming exclusive content for specific websites.\n\nShareware was also the distribution method of choice of early modern first-person shooters (FPS) like \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\".\n\nThere is a technical difference between shareware and demos. Up to the early 1990s, shareware could easily be upgraded to the full version by adding the \"other episodes\" or full portion of the game; this would leave the existing shareware files intact. Demos are different in that they are \"self-contained\" programs which are \"not\" upgradable to the full version. A good example is the Descent shareware versus the Descent II demo; players were able to retain their saved games on the former but not the latter.\n\nMagazines that include the demos on a CD or DVD and likewise may be exclusive to a certain publication. Demos are also sometimes released on cover tape/disks, especially in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, but given the increasing size of demos and widespread availability of broadband internet, this common practice throughout the 1980s and '90s gradually lost cover focus to full games. With the advent of console online services such as Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, demos are also becoming available as a free or premium download.\n\nConsole manufacturers also often release their systems with a demo disc containing playable previews of games to be released for their console.\n\nThe availability of demos varies between formats. Systems that use cartridges typically did not have demos available to them, due to the cost of duplication, whereas systems supporting more cheaply produced media, such as tapes, floppy disks, and later CD-ROM and DVD-ROM have; the Internet has more recently been a source for demos, although typically this is in addition to other distribution media available for the system in question.\n\nGame demos come in two variations: playable and non-playable (also called a \"rolling demo\"). Playable demos generally have exactly the same gameplay as the upcoming full game, although game advancement is usually limited to a certain point, and occasionally some advanced features might be disabled. A non-playable demo is essentially the gaming equivalent of a teaser trailer.\n\nGenerally, playable demos are stripped-down versions of the full game, restricting gameplay to some levels, only allowing access to some features, or limiting the amount of time playable in the game.\n\nHowever, some demos provide content not available in the full game. An example of this was the \"Age of Empires\" demo which included a Hittites campaign and two maps not available in the full version. Also, the \"Half-Life\" demo \"\" is a self-contained game, adapted from material cut from the development of the main game. The demo for \"The Stanley Parable\" takes place in an area created specifically for the demo to show off the premise and humor of the game, as the narrator states multiple times that the player is taking part in a \"video game demonstration\".\n\nIn other cases a demo may differ from the equivalent section in the full game, for instance when the demo is released as a preview before the full game is completed. An example of this is the demo for \"Mafia II\" which took place in an altered version of the \"Buzzsaw\" mission set in the 1950s, as opposed to the equivalent mission in the full game, which was set in 1945.\n\nDemos for platform or other action games generally only include the first few levels of the game. Demos of adventure games are often limited to a very small number of rooms, and have the \"save game\" feature disabled. Demos of sports games usually limit play to an accelerated half-time or complete match between a small number of teams (which at the same time led to the practice of \"demo expanders\" that allow the tweaking of some of those settings). Likewise, demos of racing games are ordinarily restricted to a single race with a pre-selected car.\n\nA non-playable demo is a recording of gameplay, either recorded in a video, or played through using the game's own engine showing off the game's features. They are mainly displayed at gaming conventions, such as E3, when the game is still in early production as a technology or gameplay preview. Such demos might also be distributed through the Internet or with magazines as trailers for an upcoming game, or featured at retail stores (often among playable demos).\n"}

Its origins can be traced back to Africa via the middle passage and the use of African slave labor during the country's colonial period. Africans brought to labor as slaves in Ecuador brought with them this music form heavily influenced from the Bantu cultures of the Congo. The people dance in pairs to the drums and use improvisation to build relationships between the dancer and lead drummer.\n\nThis music and dance tends to have a prominent Spanish, mestizo and indigenous influence in the melodies. It could go from a mid tempo to a very fast rhythm. It is usually played with guitars along with the main local instrument which is also called bomba which is a drum along with a guiro and sometimes bombos and bongos. A variation of it is la \"banda mocha\" which are groups that play bomba with a bombo, guiro and plant leaves to give melody.\n\nRecently it is enjoying some national exposure but outside the Chota Valley it is mostly popular in cities such as Quito and Ibarra which have important concentrations of afro-chotan people.

Schweizer notes that in Greek the term is very similar to \"little wings\" he feels that \"little tower\" or \"parapet\" would be a more accurate translation.

Harrington believes that the verse may be linked to the reference to protecting wings in . Gundry lists three sites on the temple that have been considered for the setting of this scene. Artists and others using the traditional translation \"pinnacle\" generally set the event on the top of the temple's main tower above the sanctuary proper, some 180 feet above ground. Another view is that it was set atop the lintel of the main gateway into the temple, the most prominent position where the pair could easily have been seen. The third site, and that adopted by tradition, is that it was at a tower the southeast corner of the outer wall that looks down into the Kidron Valley. In a related tradition James the Just was said to have been executed by being thrown from this same tower.\n"}

It is an American Water Landmark.\n\nThe bridge has five traffic lanes in each direction. The outermost lane in each direction is an entrance/exit-only lane for traffic to/from the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland and the George Washington Memorial Parkway and Georgetown Pike (State Route 193) in Virginia. There are no facilities for pedestrians or cyclists, which are prohibited.\n\nOpened on December 31, 1962, the bridge was originally named the \"Cabin John Bridge\" because of its proximity to the community of Cabin John on the Maryland side of the Potomac River. The bridge opened without a ceremony due to the cold weather. On May 30, 1969, the bridge was officially renamed the \"American Legion Memorial Bridge\" in a ceremony led by Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System. This action reduced confusion with the Union Arch Bridge, which carries the Washington Aqueduct and MacArthur Boulevard across Cabin John Creek and which some people also called \"the Cabin John Bridge\". The bridge was widened from its original 6-lane configuration to the current 10-lane version by 1992 via a third span filling the median between what was originally two separate spans.\n\nThe American Legion Memorial Bridge is an important commuter route because of its proximity to edge cities and high tech centers in Maryland and Virginia. It is the only high volume crossing between Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia, the most populous counties in their respective states. It is also the only major crossing between Maryland and Virginia between the Point of Rocks Bridge, more than upstream and the Chain Bridge downstream between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia. The only other crossing in this stretch is the low-volume White's Ferry, which is also the last operating ferry on the Potomac. Congestion on the American Legion Bridge and commuter travel between the western Washington suburbs in both states has fueled support for a western bridge around the Loudoun County/Fairfax County line in Virginia (Virginia Route 28/Fairfax County Parkway area), or farther out as part of the Western Transportation Corridor. Opponents claim that another bridge would increase development in those areas, increase traffic, and generate more pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nIt was announced on November 12, 2019, that the existing spans will be rebuilt and replaced with a new structure expanding capacity from eight to twelve lanes, and will incorporate toll lanes.\n\nThe bridge crosses the western terminus of the Potomac Heritage Trail and the George Washington Memorial Parkway on the Virginian side of the Potomac River.

{"id": "1989166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989166", "title": "Phagosome", "text": "Phagosome\n\nIn cell biology, a phagosome is a vesicle formed around a particle engulfed by a phagocyte via phagocytosis. Professional phagocytes include macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs). A phagosome is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around a microorganism, a senescent cell or an apoptotic cell. Phagosomes have membrane-bound proteins to recruit and fuse with lysosomes to form mature phagolysosomes. The lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which kill and digest the pathogens. Phagosomes can also form in non-professional phagocytes, but they can only engulf a smaller range of particles, and do not contain ROS. The useful materials (e.g. amino acids) from the digested particles are moved into the cytosol, and waste is removed by exocytosis. Phagosome formation is crucial for tissue homeostasis and both innate and adaptive host defense against pathogens.\n\nHowever, some bacteria can exploit phagocytosis as an invasion strategy. They either reproduce inside of the phagolysosome \"(e.g. Coxiella\" spp.) or escape into the cytoplasm before the phagosome fuses with the lysosome (e.g. \"Rickettsia\" spp.).\nMany Mycobacteria, including \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\"\n\nand \"Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis\"\n, can manipulate the host macrophage to prevent lysosomes from fusing with phagosomes and creating mature phagolysosomes. Such incomplete maturation of the phagosome maintains an environment favorable to the pathogens inside it\n\nPhagosomes are large enough to degrade whole bacteria, or apoptotic and senescent cells, which are usually >0.5μm in diameter. This means a phagosome is several orders of magnitude bigger than an endosome, which is measured in nanometres.\n\nPhagosomes are formed when pathogens or opsonins bind to a transmembrane receptor, which are randomly distributed on the phagocyte cell surface. Upon binding, \"outside-in\" signalling triggers actin polymerisation and pseudopodia formation, which surrounds and fuses behind the microorganism. Protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and phospholipase C (PLC) are all needed for signalling and controlling particle internalisation. More cell surface receptors can bind to the particle in a zipper-like mechanism as the pathogen is surrounded, increasing the binding avidity. Fc receptor (FcR), complement receptors (CR), mannose receptor and Dectin-1 are phagocytic receptors, which means that they can induce phagocytosis if they are expressed in non-phagocytic cells such as fibroblasts. Other proteins such as Toll-like receptors are involved in pathogen pattern recognition and are often recruited to phagosomes but do not specifically trigger phagocytosis in non-phagocytic cells, so they are not considered phagocytic receptors.\n\nOpsonins are molecular tags such as antibodies and complements that attach to pathogens and up-regulate phagocytosis. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the major type of antibody present in the serum. It is part of the adaptive immune system, but it links to the innate response by recruiting macrophages to phagocytose pathogens. The antibody binds to microbes with the variable Fab domain, and the Fc domain binds to Fc receptors (FcR) to induce phagocytosis.\n\nComplement-mediated internalisation has much less significant membrane protrusions, but the downstream signalling of both pathways converge to activate Rho GTPases. They control actin polymerisation which is required for the phagosome to fuse with endosomes and lysosomes.\n\nOther non-professional phagocytes have some degree of phagocytic activity, such as thyroid and bladder epithelial cells that can engulf erythrocytes and retinal epithelial cells that internalise retinal rods. However non-professional phagocytes do not express specific phagocytic receptors such as FcR and have a much lower rate of internalisation.\n\nSome invasive bacteria can also induce phagocytosis in non-phagocytic cells to mediate host uptake. For example, \"Shigella\" can secrete toxins that alter the host cytoskeleton and enter the basolateral side of enterocytes.\n\nAs the membrane of the phagosome is formed by the fusion of the plasma membrane, the basic composition of the phospholipid bilayer is the same. Endosomes and lysosomes then fuse with the phagosome to contribute to the membrane, especially when the engulfed particle is very big, such as a parasite. They also deliver various membrane proteins to the phagosome and modify the organelle structure.\n\nPhagosomes can engulf artificial low-density latex beads and then purified along a sucrose concentration gradient, allowing the structure and composition to be studied. By purifying phagosomes at different time points, the maturation process can also be characterised. Early phagosomes are characterised by Rab5, which transition into Rab7 as the vesicle matures into late phagosomes.\n\nThe nascent phagosome is not inherently bactericidal. As it matures, it becomes more acidic from pH 6.5 to pH 4, and gains characteristic protein markers and hydrolytic enzymes. The different enzymes function at various optimal pH, forming a range so they each work in narrow stages of the maturation process. Enzyme activity can be fine-tuned by modifying the pH level, allowing for greater flexibility. The phagosome moves along microtubules of the cytoskeleton, fusing with endosomes and lysosomes sequentially in a dynamic \"kiss-and-run\" manner. This intracellular transport depends on the size of the phagosomes. Larger organelles (with a diameter of about 3 µm) are transported very persistently from the cell periphery towards the perinuclear region whereas smaller organelles (with a diameter of about 1 µm) are transported more bidirectionally back and forth between cell center and cell periphery. Vacuolar proton pumps (v-ATPase) are delivered to the phagosome to acidify the organelle compartment, creating a more hostile environment for pathogens and facilitating protein degradation. The bacterial proteins are denatured in low pH and become more accessible to the proteases, which are unaffected by the acidic environment. The enzymes are later recycled from the phagolysosome before egestion so they are not wasted. The composition of the phospholipid membrane also changes as the phagosome matures.\n\nFusion may take minutes to hours depending on the contents of the phagosome; FcR or mannose receptor-mediated fusion last less than 30 minutes, but phagosomes containing latex beads may take several hours to fuse with lysosomes. It is suggested that the composition of the phagosome membrane affects the rate of maturation. \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" has a very hydrophobic cell wall, which is hypothesised to prevent membrane recycling and recruitment of fusion factors, so the phagosome does not fuse with lysosomes and the bacterium avoids degradation.\n\nSmaller lumenal molecules are transferred by fusion faster than larger molecules, which suggests that a small aqueous channel forms between the phagosome and other vesicles during \"kiss-and-run\", through which only limited exchange is allowed.\n\nShortly after internalisation, F-actin depolymerises from the newly formed phagosome so it becomes accessible to endosomes for fusion and delivery of proteins. The maturation process is divided into early and late stages depending on characteristic protein markers, regulated by small Rab GTPases. Rab5 is present on early phagosomes, and controls the transition to late phagosomes marked by Rab7.\n\nRab5 recruits PI-3 kinase and other tethering proteins such as Vps34 to the phagosome membrane, so endosomes can deliver proteins to the phagosome. Rab5 is partially involved in the transition to Rab7, via the CORVET complex and the HOPS complex in yeast. The exact maturation pathway in mammals is not well understood, but it is suggested that HOPS can bind Rab7 and displace the guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Rab11 is involved in membrane recycling.\n\nThe phagosome fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, which has various bactericidal properties. The phagolysosome contains reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) and hydrolytic enzymes. The compartment is also acidic due to proton pumps (v-ATPases) that transport H across the membrane, used to denature the bacterial proteins.\n\nThe exact properties of phagolysosomes vary depending on the type of phagocyte. Those in dendritic cells have weaker bactericidal properties than those in macrophages and neutrophils. Also, macrophages are divided into pro-inflammatory \"killer\" M1 and \"repair\" M2. The phagolysosomes of M1 can metabolise arginine into highly reactive nitric oxide, while M2 use arginine to produce ornithine to promote cell proliferation and tissue repair.\n\nMacrophages and neutrophils are professional phagocytes in charge of most of the pathogen degradation, but they have different bactericidal methods. Neutrophils have granules that fuse with the phagosome. The granules contain NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase, which produce toxic oxygen and chlorine derivatives to kill pathogens in an oxidative burst. Proteases and anti-microbial peptides are also released into the phagolysosome. Macrophages lack granules, and rely more on phagolysosome acidification, glycosidases, and proteases to digest microbes. Phagosomes in dendritic cells are less acidic and have much weaker hydrolytic activity, due to a lower concentration of lysosomal proteases and even the presence of protease inhibitors.\n\nPhagosome formation is tied to inflammation via common signalling molecules. PI-3 kinase and PLC are involved in both the internalisation mechanism and triggering inflammation. The two proteins, along with Rho GTPases, are important components of the innate immune response, inducing cytokine production and activating the MAP kinase signalling cascade. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-12 are all produced.\n\nThe process is tightly regulated and the inflammatory response varies depending on the particle type within the phagosome. Pathogen-infected apoptotic cells will trigger inflammation, but damaged cells that are degraded as part of the normal tissue turnover do not. The response also differs according to the opsonin-mediated phagocytosis. FcR and mannose receptor-mediated reactions produce pro-inflammatory reactive oxygen species and arachidonic acid molecules, but CR-mediated reactions do not result in those products.\n\nImmature dendritic cells (DCs) can phagocytose, but mature DCs cannot due to changes in Rho GTPases involved in cytoskeleton remodelling. The phagosomes of DCs are less hydrolytic and acidic than those of macrophages and neutrophils, as DCs are mainly involved in antigen presentation rather than pathogen degradation. They need to retain protein fragments of a suitable size for specific bacterial recognition, so the peptides are only partially degraded. Peptides from the bacteria are trafficked to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). The peptide antigens are presented to lymphocytes, where they bind to T-cell receptors and activates T-cells, bridging the gap between innate and adaptive immunity. This is specific to mammals, birds, and jawed fish, as insects do not have adaptive immunity.\n\nAncient single-celled organisms such as amoeba use phagocytosis as a way to acquire nutrients, rather than an immune strategy. They engulf other smaller microbes and digest them within the phagosome of around one bacterium per minute, which is much faster than professional phagocytes. For the soil amoeba \"Dictyostelium discoideum\", their main food source is the bacteria \"Legionella pneumophila\", which causes Legionnaire's disease in humans. Phagosome maturation in amoeba is very similar to that in macrophages, so they are used as a model organism to study the process.\n\nPhagosomes degrade senescent cells and apoptotic cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Erythrocytes have one of the highest turnover rates in the body, and they are phagocytosed by macrophages in the liver and spleen. In the embryo, the process of removing dead cells is not well-characterised, but it is not performed by macrophages or other cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells. It is only in the adult that apoptotic cells are phagocytosed by professional phagocytes. Inflammation is only triggered by certain pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), the removal of senescent cells is non-inflammatory.\n\nAutophagosomes are different from phagosomes in that they are mainly used to selectively degrade damaged cytosolic organelles such as mitochondria (mitophagy). However, when the cell is starved or stressed, autophagosomes can also non-selectively degrade organelles to provide the cell with amino acids and other nutrients. Autophagy is not limited to professional phagocytes, it is first discovered in rat hepatocytes by cell biologist Christian de Duve. Autophagosomes have a double membrane, the inner one from the engulfed organelle, and the outer membrane is speculated to be formed from the endoplasmic reticulum or the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC). The autophagosome also fuses with lysosomes to degrade its contents. When \"M. tuberculosis\" inhibit phagosome acidification, Interferon gamma can induce autophagy and rescue the maturation process.\n\nMany bacteria have evolved to evade the bactericidal properties of phagosomes or even exploit phagocytosis as an invasion strategy.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It connects the two cities of Osaka and Kobe, between and stations respectively.\n\nThe Main Line of Hanshin is the southernmost railway to connect Osaka and Kobe. The other two lines, from south to north, are the West Japan Railway Company‘s Tōkaidō Main Line (known as the JR Kobe Line), and the Hankyu Railway's Kobe Main Line.\n\nFor nearly a century, the line served as a primary competitor to the Hankyū Kobe Line. However, in 2006, Hanshin and Hankyū were subsidiarized under a single share holding company, Hankyu Hanshin Holdings.\n\nThe Main Line started operation on April 12, 1905, by the company. The company found a solution to construct a competing line to the then JNR owned Kobe Line using a loophole in the Tram Act, allowing large portions of the line to be built using street running. It became the first interurban in Japan. This inspired other railways such as Keihan Electric Railway, Minoo Arima Electric Tramway (present Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc.), Osaka Electric Tramway (present Kintetsu), Keihin Electric Railway (present Keihin Electric Express Railway) to built their first lines in a similar fashion.\n\nThen another competing railway company, Hankyū (then Hanshin Kyuko Railway), opened the Kobe Main Line in 1920. The Kobe Main Line was designed as a faster electric mainline railway, and in response Hanshin began upgrading its interurban mainline to become more railway like. Operations included realigning and grade separating street running portions, using high platforms, and introducing express trains.\n\nIn 1968 Kobe Rapid Railway opened its Tōzai Line, and Hanshin began through operations to of Sanyo Electric Railway via Kobe Rapid (and Sanyo trains to of Hanshin and Rokkō of Hankyū).\n\nThrough limited express trains to were introduced in 2001. Then, the Hanshin Namba Line was extended to , a major junction in southern Osaka. The company announced through trains from Kobe-Sannomiya to in Nara on Kintetsu Nara Line would be operated.\n\n\nSome trains run through the Sanyō Railway Main Line to Sanyō Himeji Station in Himeji, Hyōgo beyond Motomachi terminal via Kobe Rapid Railway.\n\nThe Main Line operates eight types of trains, one of the most types among Japanese railways. This is in some part to equalize the load of each train especially in the morning for Osaka (Umeda station) with short length of EMU length and with few (only double) tracks. For the extension of the Hanshin Namba Line, from Nishikujo to Osaka Namba, on March 20, 2009, the diagrams of the Hanshin Railway were revised.\n\nThe Main Line, having 39 stations (including the Kobe Kosoku Line), is noted for its \"high density\" of stations. In comparison, Kobe-Sannomiya Station is the 16th station on the Hankyū Kobe Main Line from Umeda Station and Motomachi Station is the 15th station on the JR Kobe Line from Osaka Station.\n\nFor connections and distances, see the route diagram.\n\n"}

{"id": "1989219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989219", "title": "Siphnian Treasury", "text": "Siphnian Treasury\n\nThe Siphnian Treasury was a building at the Ancient Greek cult centre of Delphi, erected to host the offerings of the polis, or city-state, of Siphnos. It was one of a number of treasuries lining the \"Sacred Way\", the processional route through the Sanctuary of Apollo, erected to win the favor of the gods and increase the prestige of the donor polis. It was one of the earlier surviving buildings of this type, and its date remains a matter for debate, with the most plausible date being around 525 BC. Until recently it was often confused or conflated with the neighbouring Cnidian Treasury, a similar but less elaborate building, as the remains of the two had become mixed together and earlier theoretical reconstructions used parts of both.\n\nThe people of Siphnos had gained enormous wealth from their silver and gold mines in the Archaic period (Herodotus III.57) and used the tithe of their income to erect the treasury, the first religious structure made entirely out of marble. The building was used to house many lavish votive offerings given to the priests to be offered to Apollo.\n\nThe Treasury fell to ruins over the centuries, although it stood for much longer than many other monuments, probably due to its decoration which was venerated by the following generations. Currently, the sculpture and a reconstruction of the Treasury are to be seen in the Delphi Archaeological Museum.\n\nThe only classical source to provide information on this building is Herodotus (3:57-8). If Herodotus is to be deemed a reliable source, this would be sufficient for verifying the date. In his account Herodotus states that the Siphnians had recently founded a temple at Delphi when a group of Samians arrived asking for support against the tyrannical Polycrates. In respect to this, both Herodotus and Thucydides state that Polykrates ruled during the reign of the Persian king Kambyses (c. 529-522 BC). This would thus date the monument at about 525 BC.\none source considers the date of construction as more likely some time absolutely limited to after 480 BC (Whitley).\n\nThe croquis of the treasury develops in two parts; a pronaos, or porch, and a cella, or enclosure. The pronaos is distyle in antis, i.e., the side walls extend to the front of the porch, and the pediment is supported by two caryatids instead of plain pilasters. Below the pediment runs a continuous frieze. The building is 8.27 metres long and 6.09 wide.\n\nThe pediment of the treasury shows the incident of Herakles stealing Apollo's tripod which was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. The treasury was also one of the first Greek buildings to utilize falling and reclining figures to fill the corners of the pediment. The sculptural friezes that run around the building depict various scenes from Greek Mythology. The names of the acting persons were inscribed on the background, most of them are still visible in raking light. The Eastern side depicts an assembly of the 12 Olympian gods seated. In the lost centre of the assembly Hermes holding the scales filled with the souls of Achilles an Memnon was depicted (weighing of souls/so-called psychostasia). To the left are seated the gods protecting Memnon and the Trojans: Apollo, Ares, Aphrodite and Artemis. In the middle sits Zeus on his throne. On the other half of this frieze one discerns Achilles and Memnon fighting over the body of dead Antilochos. The West side may show the story of the Judgment of Paris, death of Orion or rather Athena translating Herakles to the Olymp. The north side displays the Gigantomachy.The southern frieze is the most worn out; one discerns clearly the traces of beautifully carved horses; it has been suggested that the scene depicts the abduction of Hippodameia by Pelops or of the Leucippides by the Dioscuri or the abduction of Persephone by Hades.\nThe reliefs were painted over with vivid shades of green, blue, red and gold, thus creating a unique sense of polychromy.\n\nOn the façade of the temple-like ionic Treasury of the Siphnians there are two \"korai\" (maidens), instead of columns, between the pilasters, which constitute beautiful supports for the Ionic architrave. This type of opulent decoration featuring female figures full of motion and plasticity rather than the usual abstract architectural shapes of temples, foreshadows the rare beauty of the Caryatids erected subsequently at the Erechtheion in the Acropolis of Athens.\n\nIt is the only surviving pediment of the Siphnian Treasury and depicts a famous Delphic theme. In the center of the pediment there is Zeus (other sources claim it is Athena or Hermes), on the left Apollo and on the right Hercules. The two young gods are competing for the Delphic tripod and Zeus in the middle is trying to separate them. The sculpture shows the anger of Hercules because Pythia refused to give him an oracle, since he had not been cleansed from the murder of Iphitus. An outraged Hercules has already managed to seize the sacred tripod and Apollo is trying to pull it away from him.\n\nThe east side of the pediment depicts a scene from the Assembly of the Gods during the Trojan war, where the gods are discussing the issue with lively gestures like they are arguing. To the right we see Athena as the head of the gods who side with the Greeks. On the left we see the gods who protect and defend the Trojans: Apollo, Ares, Aphrodite and Artemis. In the middle we see Zeus in a lavish throne. \nAt another part of the pediment we see a scene from the Trojan war: the scene is a duel over the dead body of a warrior, where the two adversaries are flanked by the heroes of the Achaeans on the right and those of the Trojans respectively on the left. The figure of old Nestor is encouraging the Greeks.\n\nThe theme on the north frieze is the Battle of the Giants (Gigantomachy), namely the battle of the sons of the Earth, the Giants, with the Olympian gods for power. It is a widespread myth about the conflict between the old and the new world order, depicted very frequently in ancient Greek art. It symbolizes the triumph of order and civilization over savagery, barbarism and anarchy. On one side are the Giants. Heavily armed with helmets, shields, breastplates and greaves, they are attacking the gods from the right with spears, swords and stones. On the opposite side are the gods. First Hephaestus stands out with his short chiton, standing in front of his bellows. He is followed by two females fighting two Giants, then Dionysus (or possibly Heracles), and Themis on her chariot drawn by lions. A pair of gods who are shooting their arrows against the Giants must be Artemis and Apollo. They are followed by the other gods, but these sculptures do not survive in good condition.\n\nThis side of the frieze could be seen from the sacred way, as the pilgrims ascended towards the Oracle. This way they had the opportunity to admire the scene of Gigantomachy, which transforms through the artistic relief into a narrative, unfolding in multiple levels, which nevertheless maintains its visibility, consistency and figurative nature despite the interwoven figures and the various action scenes.\n\nUnfortunately, only a few relief figures have survived on the west frieze. The theme portrayed here is traditionally thought to be the Judgment of Paris, where the most beautiful goddess would be selected from among Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena. The first goddess coming to be judged is Athena, standing proud on the winged chariot with Hermes as her charioteer. Elsewhere, we see Aphrodite descending from her chariot, with a particular grace, holding the strings of what some interpret to be a necklace. In the section of the frieze that has been lost, one could imagine Hera mounting her chariot angrily to depart after her rejection.\n\nThis interpretation has come under scrutiny, however. Neer writes that the Judgement narrative has been somewhat forced upon this frieze, spending too much time on glaring blanks and not enough analyzing what little evidence is present. A major issue lies in the identity of the goddess traditionally thought to be Aphrodite. Although some Hellenistic bronzes do depict Aphrodite with a necklace, there are no examples of this in Archaic art, suggesting that it is something else being held. Neer proposes that these lines are not a necklace, but instead the drawn string of a bow. This interpretation suggests that the figure in question is actually Artemis, changing the narrative of the frieze entirely. This identification is solidified by the fact that Siphnians worshiped Artemis \"Of the Disembarkation.\" Going along with this assertion, one can assume that the missing figure is not Hera, but instead a victim of Artemis' wrath. Though little can confirm this figure's identity, there is a significant hint: palm trees are visible behind Artemis' horses, which is a common Attic painting device to indicate a desolate place. Palm trees are especially connected to the island of Delos, as it was beneath a palm tree on this island that Artemis and Apollo were born. According to Homeric myth, Artemis killed only one person on Delos: Orion. Though this identification cannot be proven outright, it at least accounts for the palm trees, the unusual necklace, and the way that the goddesses appear to be leaving, an extremely uncommon posture in depictions of the Judgement of Paris.\n\nSignificant portions of the south frieze are missing, so we can only imagine the theme it portrayed. It is probably the also popular theme of abducting women. However, the surviving fragments are the relief, well-sculpted horses portrayed full of energy, which prove the mastery of the artist. \nAs for the craftsmen who worked on the frieze the opinions of researchers and scholars who studied it are conflicting. Initially it was believed that it was the work of two different artistic workshops. Gradually, however, this view has been abandoned. It is most likely that there were two main sculptors, around whom two groups of craftsmen worked together. The artist of the north and east sides of the frieze seems more progressive, with his depictions being more active, imaginative and vibrant. In contrast, the artist of south and west side of the frieze insisted on more conservative options, without the bold inspiration and craftsmanship of the first, but with a strong painter-like character and an ionic 'color'.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1989240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989240", "title": "Biomorphism", "text": "Biomorphism\n\nBiomorphism models artistic design elements on naturally occurring patterns or shapes reminiscent of nature and living organisms. Taken to its extreme it attempts to force naturally occurring shapes onto functional devices.\n\nWithin the context of modern art, the term was coined by the British writer Geoffrey Grigson in 1935 and subsequently used by Alfred H. Barr in the context of his 1936 exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art. Biomorphist art focuses on the power of natural life and uses organic shapes, with shapeless and vaguely spherical hints of the forms of biology. Biomorphism has connections with Surrealism and Art Nouveau. \n\nThe Tate Gallery's online glossary article on biomorphic form specifies that while these forms are abstract, they \"refer to, or evoke, living forms...\". The article goes on to list Joan Miró, Jean Arp, Henry Moore, and Barbara Hepworth as examples of artists whose work epitomises the use of biomorphic form. \n\nIn July 2015 a Facebook Group was set up by British artist Andrew Charles. The group morphed into a movement over the following year and was described in a Manifesto by Charles on 16 July 2016, breaking down the Sculptural Genrea into specific patterns of creation forming no less than 8 necessary protocols for a work to conform to the term biomorphism.\n\nThe paintings of Yves Tanguy and Roberto Matta are also often cited as exemplifying the use of biomorphic form. During and after World War II, Yves Tanguy's landscapes became emptier, which has been seen as a psychological portrait of wartime Europe.\n\nThe use of metamorphosis through Picasso influenced Surrealism in the 1920s, and it appeared both as subject matter and as procedure in the figurative paintings of Leonora Carrington and in the more abstract, automatic works of André Masson.\n\nDesmond Morris, author of \"The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal\", is a biomorphic painter whose works are in museum collections, including the National Portrait Gallery in Great Britain.\n\nAmerican artists Andrew Topolski, Michael Zansky, Suzanne Anker, Frank Gillette, Michael Rees, and Bradley Rubenstein participated in exhibitions featuring biomorphic and biospheric paintings and digital art at Universal Concepts Unlimited (2000-2006). Michael Zansky's series, \"Giants and Dwarves,\" spanned 5,000 square feet of carved, burned, and painted wooden panels with biomorphic forms.\n\nThe Sagrada Família church by Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona contains many features inspired by nature, such as branching columns intended to reflect trees.\n\nOther well known examples of biomorphism in architecture can be found in the Lotus Temple in New Delhi, by Fariborz Sahba, based on a lotus flower, and the TWA Flight Center building in New York City, by Eero Saarinen, inspired by the form of a bird’s wing.\n\nOne of the leading contemporary architects that uses biomorphism in his work is Basil Al Bayati, a leading proponent of the school of Metaphoric architecture whose designs have been inspired by trees and plants, snails, whales and insects such as the Palm Mosque at the King Saud University in Riyadh, or the Al-Nakhlah Palm Telecommunications Tower, which are based upon the form of a palm tree, or the Oriental Village by the Sea, in the Dominican Republic that is based upon the segmented body of a dragonfly.\n\nBiomorphism is also seen in modern industrial design, such as the work of Alvar Aalto, and Isamu Noguchi, whose Noguchi table is considered an icon of industrial design. Presently, the effect of the influence of nature is less obvious: instead of designed objects looking exactly like the natural form, they use only slight characteristics to remind us of nature.\n\nVictor Papanek (1923–1999) was one of the first American industrial designers to use biomorphic analysis is his design assignments. He reached international prominence while at Purdue University 1964–1970. Student work and his own work is illustrated in his book Design for the Real World, published in 1970, which challenges the industrial design establishment to design for the handicapped and disadvantaged throughout the world. First published in 1970 by Bonnier in Swedish, it was published in English in 1971 by Pantheon, and eventually translated and published in 23 languages. It is perhaps the most widely read book on design.\n\nGaetano Pesce is an Italian designer who creates brightly colored acrylic furniture in biomorphic and human shapes.\n\nMarc Newson is an Australian biomorphic designer who created a Charlotte chair (1987) and three-legged carbon-fibre Black Hole table (1988).\n\n"}

An early power forward, Conacher was nicknamed \"The Big Bomber,\" for his size, powerful shot and goal scoring. He led the NHL five times in goals, and twice led in overall scoring. Over five seasons from 1931-32 to 1935-36 Conacher was named to three NHL First All-Star Teams and two NHL Second All-Star Teams. He is an Honoured Member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2013, Charlie Conacher was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. In 2017 Conacher was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\n\nConacher played three years of junior hockey, most notably with the Toronto Marlboros. Playing with future Maple Leafs teammate Harvey \"Busher\" Jackson, he achieved staggering scoring numbers, leading the Marlboros to the Memorial Cup playoffs in 1928 and 1929. In 28 playoff games with the Marlies in those two seasons, Conacher scored 50 goals, including 28 goals in the 1929 playoffs to lead his team to a Memorial Cup championship, its first of six eventual titles.\n\nSigned the next season by the Maple Leafs with Jackson, Toronto manager Conn Smythe paired the two with former farmhand Joe Primeau. The trio, nicknamed the \"Kid Line\" for their inexperience - Primeau was 23, Conacher and Jackson both 18 - became an immediate sensation in Toronto, as Conacher scored his first NHL goal in Toronto's opening 2-2 tie with the Chicago Black Hawks on November 14. Although he missed six games at the end of the season with an infected hand, he finished the season with 20 goals.\n\nThe following season, Conacher broke into the elite of the league, despite missing a number of games due to a reinjured hand. He scored 31 goals - the first of five times he led the league in goal scoring - and finishing third overall in points to Howie Morenz and Ebbie Goodfellow. Primeau finished 6th in league scoring as well, and Jackson 15th.\n\nThe 1932 season saw the team move into the new Maple Leaf Gardens. In return for Black Hawk Johnny Gottselig, whom Smythe coveted, Chicago asked for Conacher and star defenceman King Clancy for compensation, to which Smythe reportedly cabled that Santa Claus lived at the North Pole, not in Maple Leaf Gardens. Once again, Conacher missed time with a broken hand, during which a curious incident took place. League rules stated that a player receiving a third major penalty in the season would receive a one-game suspension. Conacher had two at the time of his injury, but he was dressed by coach Irvin. According to another league rule, any player jumping on the ice while his team was at full strength received a major penalty, and Irvin had Conacher do so, thus triggering his automatic suspension for a game in which he could not play anyway. With Dick Irvin the new coach of the Leafs, the Kid Line shone, leading Toronto to a Stanley Cup championship. Jackson led the league in scoring, Primeau was second and Conacher - used sparingly after his return from his injury - fourth, while once again leading the league in goals and being named to the Second All-Star Team, his best game coming in an 11-3 romp over the New York Americans in which he scored five goals. \n\nA broken collarbone sidelined Conacher for weeks in the 1933 season - the only one in a six-year stretch in which he failed to lead the league in goals - but he was once again named to the Second All-Star Team at right wing.\nThe next three seasons saw Conacher cemented among the top players in the game, as he regained his form and led the league in goal scoring all three seasons and in points in 1934 and 1935, being named First Team All-Star all three seasons, years in which the Leafs finished as runner-up in the Stanley Cup finals. Things would change in\n1937; Primeau and Clancy retired, while Conacher broke a wrist in training camp, an injury initially thought not serious. However, Conacher would only play 15 games that season and 19 the next after suffering a dislocated shoulder, as chronic injuries caught up to him, and he never again regained his form. \n\nThe Detroit Red Wings, seeking to improve their team, purchased Conacher in the fall of 1939 for a sum reported to be $16,000, and contingent on him remaining in good health. While he finished fourth on the Wings in scoring with 23 points, his days as a superstar were over. He was optioned the following season to the New York Americans, where he played his final two seasons paired on defence with former Montreal Maroons star Hooley Smith. The Amerks, who had loaded up with once-great players like Conacher, Smith, Busher Jackson, Eddie Shore and Nels Stewart, were notably slow and finished in last place both seasons, although Conacher played credibly, finished 3rd and 5th respectively in team scoring and serving as the Americans' captain both years. Only 30, Conacher retired after the 1941 season.\n\nAfter his retirement, Conacher went into coaching, meeting with remarkable success: he led the junior league Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey Association to four straight OHA Championships between 1941 and 1944, as well as three straight Eastern Canada amateur championships in 1942, 1943 and 1944, and the Memorial Cup Championship in 1944. The Generals finished in second place in both 1946 and 1947 - coincidentally, losing in both seasons to the St. Michael's College Majors, coached by his old linemate Joe Primeau.\n\nAfter resigning from his coaching post in Oshawa, Conacher was named to replace Johnny Gottselig as coach of the Chicago Black Hawks 28 games into the 1949 season. As a coach, Conacher was involved in a notable altercation when Detroit Times writer Lew Walter tried to interview him after the Red Wings defeated Chicago 9–2 on February 8, 1950. Conacher, who exploded in anger, criticized Walter's past stories and punched Walter, knocking him down to the floor. Walter announced that he would seek a warrant for Conacher's arrest. NHL president Clarence Campbell took a dim view of Conacher's actions and fined him $200. Conacher then phoned Walter and apologized, saying he regretted what had taken place. Over his three seasons at the helm, Conacher coached the Black Hawks - a team on which his younger brother Roy played - to 6th, 5th and 6th-place finishes respectively, after which he was fired in favor of Ebbie Goodfellow.\n\nConacher had nine siblings, including Hockey Hall of Famers Lionel Conacher and Roy Conacher. His son, Pete Conacher, played in the NHL, as did nephews Brian Conacher and Murray Henderson. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961 and, later, to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. In 1998, he was ranked number 36 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. Lionel's son, Lionel Jr. was a CFL football player.\n\nConacher died in 1967 of throat cancer just ten days after his 58th birthday, and was buried in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.\n\nThe Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award was an award named after Conacher. It was given out to the NHL player who best exhibited outstanding humanitarian and public services contributions, and was awarded from 1968 to 1984.\n\n"}

He was an all-rounder who played 73 One Day Internationals for Australia and was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 2004 for his performances in county cricket.\n\nHarvey started his first-class cricket career with Victoria in the Sheffield Shield in 1993 as an all-rounder. He was called up to the Australian one day cricket team in 1997 and played 73 One Day Internationals. Harvey bowled tightly at the end of games, equipped with a well disguised slower ball, as well as being a big hitting late order batsman, however he did not hit an ODI half-century.\n\nHarvey played in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa as a replacement for the injured Shane Watson. He played in Australia's group game against Pakistan, scoring 24 at better than a run-a-ball, supporting Andrew Symonds who made a match-winning 143 not out. Defending 310, Harvey was the best bowler picking up 4 wickets, including one with his first ball, as Australia won comfortably. Harvey lost his place when Darren Lehmann and Michael Bevan returned from injury. He featured in one more group game against the Netherlands where he picked up three more wickets.\n\nHe played in the first Super Six game against Sri Lanka making a brief 5 not out at the end of Australia's innings. He did not take a wicket when he bowled but he was economical. Against New Zealand he failed with the bat making just 2 but he bowled economically again, taking 1/11 in 6 overs. In the final Super Six stage against tournament surprise package Kenya he bowled tightly without reward. However, in the run chase of 175, after Australia stuttered, he and Symonds were involved together in a 50-run partnership as they saw Australia home carrying on their unbeaten run through the tournament. Harvey finished on 24 not out. Because of an injury to Damien Martyn, he played in the semi-final against Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the tournament he played 6 games, scored 66 runs at 22.00 and took 8 wickets at 19.62\n\nHarvey played for Gloucestershire from 1999 to 2003 in the English County Championship and domestic one-day competitions. He was an integral part of the team that won a number of one-day trophies, including four one-day finals in a row. Harvey also scored the first Twenty20 cricket century in 2003, and scored three T20 centuries in all. In 2004 he switched counties to play for Yorkshire for whom he played until 2005.\n\nFor 2006, he returned to play for Gloucestershire in the County Championship and Victoria in the Pura Cup. He signed to play for Derbyshire in 2007, but did not play a full season as his clearance to play as an English-qualified player was not received from the Home Office. Approval was delayed as a result of a drink-driving conviction, a decision which upset Derbyshire chief executive John Sears. Derbyshire allowed Harvey to play for Middleton Cricket Club for a weekend as a temporary replacement for their professional.\n\nFor the 2005–06 season, Harvey played with the South African provincial side Nashua-Western Province Boland, where he also coached and commentated, sometimes doing two or all three at once.\n\nHarvey excelled in the Twenty20 format, initially for Gloucestershire and Victoria. He also played in the first Indian Cricket League Twenty20 competition in 2007 for Chennai Superstars. He played in the Chennai team that won the inaugural league. He won both the man of the match award for the final and the player of the tournament award.\n\nBeing a specialist Twenty20 player, he signed short-term deals especially for the Twenty20 with Hampshire Hawks in 2008 and Northamptonshire Steelbacks in 2009. On his debut for Northants, he scored 12 with the bat but starred with the ball taking 4 for 18 off 4 overs to help them to a 17-run win against Warwickshire Bears. Harvey contracted swine flu, which kept him out of the quarter finals which Northamptonshire won. He returned to play in the finals day of the competition.\n\nIn February 2010, Harvey signed to play T20 and first-class matches for Zimbabwean franchise Southern Rocks\n\nHarvey was appointed assistant to head coach Richard Dawson at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in the 2015 county season.\n\nHarvey is uncle of Mackenzie Harvey.\n"}

Along with Shi Shen, he is believed to be the first in history known by name to compile a star catalogue, preceded by the anonymous authors of the early Babylonian star catalogues and followed by the Greek Hipparchus who is the first known in the Western tradition to have compiled a star catalogue.\n\nGan De made some of the first detailed observations of Jupiter in recorded history. He described the planet as \"very large and bright\".\n\nIn one of his observations on Jupiter, he reported a \"small reddish star\" next to Jupiter. The historian Xi Zezong has claimed that this was a naked-eye observation of Ganymede in the summer of 364 BC, \nlong before Galileo Galilei's celebrated discovery of the same in 1610 (all four of the brightest moons are technically visible to the unaided eye, but in practice are normally hidden by the glare of Jupiter).\n\nBy occluding Jupiter itself behind a high tree limb perpendicular to the satellites' orbital plane to prevent the planet's glare from obscuring them, one or more of the Galilean moons might be spotted in favorable conditions. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi and Gan together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.\n\nShi Shen and Gan De divided the celestial sphere into 365°, as a tropical year has 365 days. At the time, most ancient astronomers adopted the Babylon division where the celestial sphere is divided by 360°.\n\nAs the earliest attempt to document the sky during the Warring States period, Gan De's work possesses high scientific value. He wrote two books, the \"Treatise on Jupiter\" and the 8-volume \"Treatise on Astronomical Astrology\", both of which have been lost. Gan De also wrote the \"Astronomic Star Observation\" (天文星占, Tianwen xingzhan).\n\nIt can be seen on the quotations under \"Shiji\" (volume 27) and \"Hanshu\" (volume 26), but was preserved mostly in the \"Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era\".\n\nIn 1973, a similar catalogue by Gan De and Shi Shen was uncovered within the Mawangdui Silk Texts. Arranged under the name of \"Divination of Five Planets\", it records the motion of Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and other planets in their orbits between 246 BC and 177 BC.\n\n\n"}

It achieved success with optical storage chips and its stock price increased substantially around the time of the tech bubble in 2000. After falling on hard times, in 2003 it was acquired by Zoran Corporation. \n\nOak Technology helped develop the ATAPI standard and provided the \"oakcdrom.sys\" CD-ROM driver that was ubiquitous on DOS-based systems in the mid-1990s.\n\nOak Technology, Inc was founded in 1987 and was based in Sunnyvale, California, USA. During the late 1980s through the early 1990s, Oak was a supplier of PC graphics (SVGA) chipsets and PCBs. Oak Technology also supplied mother board chipsets - a PS2 compatible chipset and the Oaknote chipset for notebooks. Oak enjoyed modest success in the value segment (low-end) of the market, but without an effective Windows accelerator, ultimately failed to remain competitive.\n\nIn 1994, Sun Microsystems decided to change the name of their new language from \"Oak\" to \"Java\" because \"Oak\" was already trademarked by Oak Technology.\n\nThe company had a dominant position early on in the market for semiconductors for CD-ROM drives (around 1995) and later regained a prominent position in optical storage chips as the market transitioned to recordable/rewritable technology, resulting in substantial revenue growth and stock price appreciation at the height of the tech bubble in 2000.\n\nHowever, the company could not maintain growth and the stock price declined substantially, including a drop by more than half on 19 June 2002.\n\nIt then acquired the pioneering digital TV chip company Teralogic at the end of 2002 whose technology would later contribute to Zoran's DTV chip development after Zoran acquired Oak Technology in 2003. \n\nOTI037C - 8-bit VGA chipset, with up to 256KB of DRAM.

Capable of resolutions up to 1024x768x256 colors in non-interlaced mode, and up to 1280x1024x16 colors interlaced.\n\nOTI087 - One of the first VLB chipsets available. Has a 16-bit external data path, and a 32-bit internal memory controller data path. It features an improved, local-bus compatible host interface controller with read and write caching capabilities similar to those implemented on Tseng ET4000AX graphics chips, along with register-based color expansion, 16-bit graphic latch and some other new (for its time) features. Maximum BIOS resolutions are 1024x768x256 non-interlaced and 1280x1024x256 interlaced. Maximum dot clock is 80 MHz, but is usually coupled with the OTI068 clock generator capable of frequencies up to 78 MHz. This chipset supports up to 2MB of 70/70R ns DRAM. \n\nA modified version, OTI087X, added a hardware mouse cursor sprite. It was implemented on many Weitek P9000-based graphics boards as a companion VGA controller; unfortunately, on these boards the chip was typically configured with a narrow 8-bit data path to its own dedicated VGA memory, resulting in sub-par VGA mode performance.\n\nSpitfire - OTI 64105/64107 - 64-bit DRAM chipset.

DRAM and EDO supported.\n\nEon - OTI 64217 - Supports EDO and SGRAM. PCI chipset, 64-bit memory bus.\n\nWarp 5 - OTI 64317 \n- During the late 1990s, Oak was developing their first and only 2D/3D graphics accelerator chip. Warp 5 was to be a tile-based deferred renderer (TBDR), similar to PowerVR's chipsets. In the same vein as the S3 ViRGE chip, the Warp 5 was pin-compatible with a 2D-only predecessor. The chip was never released because ATI acquired the technology. It was Oak's final mainstream graphics chip development effort.\n\nThis graphics processor was based on a region concept and had many similarities to Microsoft's Talisman architecture. The chip processed each region at a time and did on chip z-sorting and anti-aliasing. As a result, the chip did 24-bit floating point Z, sub-pixel anti-aliasing, order independent translucency, non-linear fogging and atmospheric effects and MIP-Mapping. Typically, such region based architectures are gated by the number of polygons that can be processed per region, but Oak claimed that there were no such limitations in the WARP 5.\n\nThe specifications included:\n\nOak sold millions of chip solutions for CD-ROM, CD-R/RW, DVD-ROM and DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drives, primarily for the PC market.\n\n"}

He attended the University of Western Australia and Claremont Teachers College before turning professional in 1969.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s Marsh was a regular winner on the European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the PGA Tour of Australasia. He also won several events in Asia outside Japan, winning the Asia Golf Circuit overall title in 1972 and 1973, and one on the U.S.-based PGA Tour, the 1977 Heritage Classic. Marsh had an outstanding win rate on the European Tour, where he accumulated eleven titles even though he never played more than seven events in Europe in a season. He also won the Colgate World Match Play Championship, which was not an official money European Tour event at the time, in England in 1977. He had 56 wins in all in his regular career, making him one of the most successful players of his era not to win a major championship. He was voted Australian Sportsman of the year in 1977.\n\nAs a senior, Marsh has played extensively in the United States on the Champions Tour winning six events including two senior majors: the 1997 U.S. Senior Open and the 1999 Tradition.

It is the largest city in the province, and is 90 km away from Iran's third largest city, Isfahan. At the time of the 2006 census, Shahrekord had a population of about 148,464 and the Shahrekord metropolitan area had a population of 380,312.\n\nShahr-e Kord is known for its natural environment, cold winters, waterfalls and rivers. Shahr-e Kord is Iran's highest capital city at above the sea level. This led the city to be known as “Roof of Iran”. Shahr-e Kord is at a distance of southwest from Tehran.\n\nIts weather is cold in winter and mild in summer. The town has a ski resort (Bardeh) located about away and several natural lagoons and small lakes for outdoor activities.\n\nShahr-e Kord, at face value, seems to mean \"City of the Kurds\". In antiquity, the place had been called \"Dezh Gord\" (دژگرد), where \"dezh\" (دژ) means \"fortress\" and \"gord\" (گرد) means \"hero\". After the Muslim conquest of Persia, the name changed to \"Deh Kord\" (); \"dezh\" was reinterpreted as \"deh\" (ده) meaning \"village\" and \"gord\" became \"kord\" because the Arabic alphabet lacks the letter \"g\" (گ). Other examples of cities whose names changed partly due to the influence of the Arabic language are Chamgordan, Boroujerd and Dezful, which were called Chamgord, Borougord and Dezhpol, respectively, before the Islamic conquest. In 1935, the name was finally changed to its present form with \"deh\" being replaced with \"shahr\" (شهر) meaning \"city\", which better reflects the size of Shahr-e Kord.\n\nCoins have been found in Shahr-e Kord dating back to the Sassanian and Parthian era.\n\nCurrently, people living in Shahr-e Kord are of three major backgrounds: Bakhtiari, Qashqai and indigenous Persian speakers of Shahr-e Kord; however, the people of Shahr-e Kord speak Persian as a \"lingua franca.\" Shahr-e Kord is assumed to be first developed by nomadic farmers because it encompasses vast meadows and several springs. Deh Kord was gradually founded by the immigrants from Isfahan, its suburbs, and the villages around Shahr-e Kord, most of whom started to run businesses such as agriculture, horticulture, hat making, felt making, oil and wool trading, and other industries.\n\nShahr-e Kord (Zagros) is located about southwest of Isfahan and of Tehran. It is topographically situated in the north of the Zagros Mountains. Being located above the sea level, Shahr-e Kord (Zagros) is the most elevated among the centers of the provinces of Iran, known as the Roof of Iran.\n\nShahr-e Kord (Zagros) enjoys a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\", according to the Köppen climate classification) with hot summer days, mild summer nights, cool winter days and cold winter nights. The annual average temperature in Shahr-e Kord (Zagros) is about 11 °C but the minimum and maximum absolute temperatures recorded in Shahr-e Kord (Zagros) during the last 30 years have been -32 °C and 42 °C, respectively. January is the coldest month and July is the hottest month. Although the humidity level is moderate or high in winter, the amount of rainfall is close to zero in planting seasons, except for April and May.\n\nThe Shahr-e Kord Bus Organization has 150 buses in its fleet which operate different routes throughout the city.\n\nShahrekord Airport is a domestic airport located to the south of the city. It currently has flights to and from two cities: Tehran and Mashhad.\n\nThere are three universities in the city of Shar-e Kord, Public and state university is Shahr-e Kord University(SKU) with \n5,713 students. The other universities are Shahr-e Kord University of Medical Sciences (SKUMS) with 1,690 students and Islamic Azad University of Shahr-e Kord Branch (IAUSHK) with 7,400 students that is the one of most popular universities in Iran with talented faculty members and students.\n\n\n"}

Headquartered in Philadelphia, the company is organised into three business groups of Specialty Materials, Performance Materials and Electronic Materials, and also has two stand-alone businesses of Powder Coatings and Salt. Formerly a Fortune 500 Company, Rohm and Haas employs more than 17,000 people in 27 countries, with its last sales revenue reported as an independent company at US$8.9 billion. Dow Chemical Company bought Rohm and Haas for $15 billion in 2009.\n\nThe company was founded in Esslingen, Germany, by Dr. Otto Röhm and Mr. Otto Haas in 1907. Haas moved to Philadelphia and began the American side of the business on September 1, 1909, from an office on Front Street, while Otto Röhm remained in Germany to run a company that would eventually become Röhm GmbH. The American company grew rapidly as World War I approached, because of their initial invention, a synthetic substitute (brand name Oropon) for fermented dog dung, which was used for bating leather (part of the old tanning process); leather was needed for the war in large quantities for belts and saddles.\n\nThe company again grew rapidly as World War II approached, as it manufactured Plexiglas acrylic, a transparent plastic which was needed for aircraft canopies. They sold this part of the business in 1998 to Elf Atochem (now Arkema).\n\nIn 1965 Rohm and Haas moved its headquarters from its Washington Square to a new building on Independence Mall a few blocks away. The new Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters was designed by Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. (now EwingCole).\n\nIn 1999 Rohm and Haas acquired the Morton Salt company.\n\nThe main products of Rohm and Haas are specialty materials, advanced chemistry that allows end-use products to have a particular characteristic, e.g., low-odor, water-based paints, sunscreens with greater SPF functionality, or more powerful semiconductor chips.\n\nOn July 10, 2008 Rohm and Haas announced it was being bought by Dow Chemical Company for US$18.8 billion. Rohm and Haas will continue doing business under its name and will remain in its Philadelphia headquarters. Dow Chemical tried to back out of acquiring Rohm and Haas, when a deal to form a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum that would give Dow money to buy Rohm and Haas failed.\nOn 2 April 2009, it was reported that Morton Salt was being acquired by German fertilizer and salt company K+S for a total enterprise value of US$1.7bn. The sale, completed by October 2009, was in conjunction with the Dow Chemical Company's takeover of Rohm and Haas.\n\nDow announced their intent to sell the Rohm and Haas Powder Division.\n\nOn July 6, 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency charged Rohm and Haas with violating the Clean Air Act after inspecting its facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The Agency claimed that the company failed to repair a deteriorated chemical storage tank, failed to maintain a complete list of monitoring regulations, and failed to remove accumulated hazardous wastes.\n\nOn February 12, 2006, eleven workers were hospitalized after being exposed to fumes that leaked out of the Rohm and Haas Corporation chemical plant in Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 15, 2006, an employee died when working on a steam ejector due to the inhalation of hydrogen sulfide gas. An investigation determined that since the sewer vent was plugged, the hydrogen sulfide gas accumulated into large concentrations that became lethal.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Rohm and Haas, and other defendants, were sued in Philadelphia for failing to prevent toxic spills, to employ adequate groundwater practices, and to warn residents of any potential presence of underground contamination. This led to 18 filed cases of brain tumors and cancers among local residents of Ringwood, Illinois.\n\nAs early as 1980, the company's McCullom Lake factory located in McHenry County, Illinois, underwent investigation for contamination of the town's groundwater. Studies, paid for by Rohm and Haas, showed the groundwater never affected the town's well water. The company is now one of five corporations undergoing a class-action lawsuit filed by the town's residents, claiming a direct correlation to 34 out of 1,074 residents experiencing some type of brain or pituitary gland cancer. The Northwest Herald published a six-piece investigative story on the lawsuits and residents, claiming to reveal a blatant \"mishandling\" of the entire affair on the part of local health officials and Rohm and Haas.\n\nIn 1969, union members with the Oil, Chemical, & Atomic Workers went on strike at the Rohm and Haas Deer Park facility.\n\nIn 2010, following the purchase of Rohm and Haas by Dow, Dow attempted to fire around 60 union workers and replace them with contract workers in order to lower labor expenses. Dow also wanted to end annual raises and threatened to stop pay and benefits if workers walked out. The United Steel Workers threatened a strike, but ultimately a strike was averted after a new four-year deal with Dow was negotiated. At the time, 325 of the plant's 620 workers were represented by USW.\n\nOn July 17, 2012, Brian Johns, a worker at the Deer Park facility, was injured in an explosion, and later died. The firm paid a $23,000 fine for the incident.\n\nIn April 2019, following weeks of negotiations with the United Steel Workers and two rejected contracts, Rohm and Haas locked out almost 230 members of the union. A lockout is the company equivalent of a strike. This has led to daily pickets by union members. Dow states that the plant continues to run in a safe manner by salaried workers at the plant. The negotiations are in regards to safety, excessive overtime, and arbitration. \n\n\n"}

His nickname was \"The Ottawa Fireman\".\n\nConnell joined the Senators for the 1924–25 season after the Senators dealt Clint Benedict (Ottawa's former number one goalie) to the Montreal Maroons. In 1927 he was one of the first goalies to record a 30–win season, the year that the original Ottawa Senators franchise won the last of their Stanley Cups. In the 1927–28 season he set the NHL record for the longest shutout streak at 461:29, by recording seven consecutive shutouts and another 41 minutes in the eighth game, from January 31 to February 18, 1928.\n\nThe Ottawa team fell into decline after that and, while the Ottawa team was in hiatus for the 1931–32 season, he played for the Detroit Falcons under loan.

It has an unusual feature of switchback building whereby each foundation is first built up (from ace to king) and then built down (from king to ace).\n\nFirst sixteen cards are dealt on the tableau into four columns of four cards each, turning it into a \"square.\" American rule sets, though, puts the formation of the tableau at sixteen piles, four rows of four piles each. Each pile contains a card at the start of the game.\n\nThe object of the game is to free an ace of each suit to make four foundations, then to build them up by suit up to Kings, placing the second King of each suit and finally to build them down, again by suit, to Aces.\n\nThe top cards of each column is available for play, to be placed either on the foundations or on other columns in the tableau. In the cast of American rules sets, the top card of each pile is available.\n\nWhen building on the tableau, they can be built either up or down by suit. But once a card has been built, it indicates the direction of building on the column; it cannot go both ways. For instance, when the 8♥ is placed on the 7♥, the next card to be built should be the 9♥. If the reverse happens (7♥ over 8♥), the next card should be 6♥. The direction can be altered by having the top card of the sequence placed on an appropriate card and have all other cards on the sequence follow. Furthermore, building is not round-the-corner; i.e. a sequence can be built only up to Kings/down to aces.\n\nCards can be moved one a time.

The stock can only be dealt once.\n\nThe game is won when all cards are built to the foundations. There are four foundations, one for each suit. As mentioned above, they should be built first up by suit to kings, then the second king is placed on the first and built down to aces.\n"}

It is one of the first cases that established possession as a valuable property right and as evidence of ownership. The defendant in the case was Paul de Lamerie, a great producer of silverworks in the 18th century. His name was misspelled by the court reporter.\n\nArmory was a chimney sweep's boy who found a jewel in the setting of a ring. He took the jewel to the shop of Delamirie, a goldsmith, to obtain a valuation of the item. An apprentice, the agent of Delamirie, surreptitiously removed the gems from the setting on the pretense of weighing it. The apprentice returned with the empty setting and informed Armory that it was worth three halfpence. The apprentice offered to pay him for it but Armory refused and asked the apprentice to return the stones and setting in their prior condition. The apprentice returned the socket of the jewel without the gems. Armory brought an action against Delamirie in trover (via respondeat superior for the actions of his apprentice).\n\nThe issue before the court was whether either party had any property rights to the jewel.\n\nThe Court held that both Armory and Delamirie had property rights in the jewel, even though neither was the true owner. Sir John Pratt CJ held they each have a right to possession that is enforceable against everyone except those with a greater right to the possession. The true owner of the jewel was not relevant, the Court was only concerned with who had a \"better\" right to possession. The priority of rights to possession say that a finder has better title to property that he or she finds over everyone except the true owner, thus Armory had full title to the jewel. The Court found in favour of Armory. Since the jewel was not produced at the trial, Armory was awarded the maximum value that a jewel of that form could have (under the principle that a wrongdoer should not be able to derive gain, i.e. uncertainty of damages, from the effects of his wrongdoing).\n\nThe report shows the following text:\n\n\"Armory v Delamirie\" inspired A.

A prolific scorer, Cook led the WCHL in goals twice and the NHL three times. He was named an all-star seven times between the two leagues. Known as \"The Original Ranger\", Cook was the first captain of the New York Rangers, scored the first goal in franchise history and led the team to two Stanley Cup championships.\n\nTurning to coaching following his playing career, Cook led the Cleveland Barons to two Calder Cup championships and the Minneapolis Millers to a United States Hockey League championship. He coached the New York Rangers during the 1951–52 NHL season until his retirement in 1953. Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952 and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nCook was born on October 9, 1895, in Brantford, Ontario. He was a middle child of a large family, and the eldest of three sons, preceding his brothers Frederick (\"Bun\") and Alexander (\"Bud\"). The family moved to Kingston, Ontario, where he learned to skate on the Rideau Canal. He joined the Kingston Frontenacs' junior hockey team in 1913 and played for two seasons before his career was interrupted by the First World War.\n\nHe volunteered to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1915, and served with the Canadian Field Artillery for nearly two years in France and another at the Belgian front. Cook participated in several engagements, including at Ypres, the Somme, Vimy Ridge and Hill 70. He then fought into 1919 in Siberia as part of the allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.\n\nUpon his return from the war, Cook rejoined the Frontenacs for one season before joining the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 1920. He led the Northern Ontario Hockey Association (NOHA) in both goals, 12, and points, 19, while the Greyhounds won the NOHA championship. He won the scoring title again in 1921–22 with 20 goals and 28 points.\n\nSpurning offers from National Hockey League (NHL) teams to turn professional in the eastern league, Cook moved to Saskatchewan, where he had been granted land for his service in the war. The Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) attempted to recruit him for the 1922–23 season but failed to sign him. Instead, he joined the Saskatoon Crescents. He recorded 25 points in 30 games in his first professional season.\n\nReturning to Saskatoon in 1923–24, Cook led the WCHL with 26 goals and 40 points. He was named the all-star right wing for the first of three consecutive seasons. He scored 22 goals in 1924–25.\nThe WCHL rebranded itself the Western Hockey League (WHL) and the Crescents became the Sheiks in 1925–26. Cook again led in both goals and points with 31 and 44 respectively, and had become known as the best right wing in hockey.\n\nThe WHL had run into financial difficulty in its final seasons, and after 1926, ceased operations. The Montreal Maroons intended to sign both Cook and his brother Bun to join their team for the 1926–27 NHL season. While the team's manager waited in Montreal to meet the brothers, Conn Smythe, manager of the newly formed New York Rangers, travelled to Winnipeg to reach the pair first. Smythe signed both Cook brothers for $12,000. Bill Cook was officially the first player signed by the Rangers, and was named the team's first captain. The Cook brothers joined Frank Boucher to form the \"Bread Line\", one of the early NHL's most prolific scoring lines.\n\nThe Rangers made their NHL debut on November 16, 1926, against the Maroons. Cook scored the franchise's first goal, which also stood up as the winner, in a 1–0 victory. Appearing in 44 games, he led the league in both goals, 33, and points, 37. He finished as the runner-up to Herb Gardiner of the Montreal Canadiens for the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player. The Rangers finished first in the American Division, but were eliminated by the Boston Bruins in the playoffs. Cook recorded 24 points in 1927–28, the seventh highest total in the league. The Rangers again qualified for the playoffs, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Bruins and Montreal Maroons to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship. The Bread Line scored every Rangers goal in the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nTwenty-three points in 1928–29 again placed Cook seventh in the league. The Rangers defeated the New York Americans to reach the 1929 Stanley Cup Finals, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens. Cook led the Rangers and finished fourth in league scoring in 1929–30 and 1930–31 with 59 and 42 points respectively. In 1931, he was named to the NHL's inaugural All-Star Team at right wing. It was the first of four consecutive appearances; he was placed on the first team in 1931, 1932 and 1933, and on the second team in 1934. Cook's 34 goals in 1931–32 tied Charlie Conacher for the league lead. The Rangers won the American Division title, and after defeating the Canadians, faced Conacher's Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1932 Stanley Cup Final. Toronto swept the series with three consecutive victories.\n\nCook was again the top scorer in 1932–33, leading the NHL in both goals, 28, and points, 50. At 36 years, 5 months old, Cook was the oldest player in NHL history to win a scoring title until 2013 when Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning led the NHL in scoring at the age of 39. The Rangers reached the 1933 Stanley Cup Finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Cook scored the winning goal in the second game, then scored the championship winning goal, in overtime, in the fourth game. It was the first overtime power play goal in NHL playoff history. The trophy was not available on the night the Rangers won, leading the series to become known as the \"Forgotten Cup\". Cook accepted the Stanley Cup on behalf of his team in November of that year, seven months after the Rangers victory.\n\nAfter scoring only 13 goals in 1933–34, Cook improved to 20 goals in 1934–35. In a 7–5 victory over the Maple Leafs on January 29, 1935, the Bread line scored four goals and five assists to reach a combined 1,000 points as a unit over their nine seasons together. The Bread Line was broken up in 1935–36 when Bun was forced out of the Rangers lineup by illness. Bill Cook scored just seven goals that season, and at the age of 40, scored one goal in 21 games before retiring as a player during the 1936–37 season.\n\nTurning to coaching, Cook took over as the manager of the Cleveland Barons in the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) in the 1937–38 season. He inherited a team that had struggled the season before and led it to a respectable season, winning 34 of 50 games played combined between the regular season and playoffs. Cook was pressed into service as a player as a result of injuries. His team was able to dress only 10 of 17 players in the deciding game of the Barons' playoff series against the Syracuse Stars. Cook played a regular shift in the game, but the Barons lost, 3–2, in the fourth overtime period.\n\nThe Barons finished fifth overall in the IAHL standings in 1938–39, but defeated the Springfield Indians and Providence Reds to reach the league championship series against the Philadelphia Ramblers. They won the best-of-five championship three games to one to claim the Calder Cup. Cook coached the Barons to a second Calder Cup in 1940–41, defeating the Hershey Bears in the final. Cook remained behind the Barons' bench until the conclusion of the 1942–43 American Hockey League (AHL) season. He then turned coaching duties over to his brother Bun, but remained the team's general manager.\n\nCook left the Barons to join the Minneapolis Millers of the United States Hockey League (USHL) in 1947. He coached the team for three seasons, leading the team to the Paul W. Loudon Trophy as league champions in 1949–50. He moved on to coach the Denver Falcons, also of the USHL, in 1950–51 then the Saskatoon Quakers of the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PHCL) the following season. Cook left the Quakers midway through the season when asked by Frank Boucher, general manager of the New York Rangers, to return to the NHL club as its head coach. He coached the final 47 games of the Rangers' 1951–52 season, winning 17, losing 22 and tying 8. He remained behind the Rangers bench in 1952–53, but the Rangers missed the playoffs after winning only 17 of 70 games. Cook was replaced as coach following the season as Boucher named himself head coach. Cook then retired from hockey.\n\nA prolific scorer, Cook scored 317 goals and 508 points in 591 games in his 15-year professional career. Known as \"The Original Ranger\", he led the team in goals six times. He was regarded as being the greatest right wing in the game's history when he retired, an opinion former teammate Frank Boucher retained many years later: \"Bill was the finest all-round player in Ranger history. And he's my choice as the best right winger hockey ever knew – despite the fact that others disagree and give their votes to Rocket Richard or Gordie Howe. I say Cook topped them both.\" Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nA popular former Ranger, Cook participated in the closing of the old Madison Square Garden and the opening of the new facility in 1968. In recognition of his scoring the first Rangers goal in the old Garden, he was asked to \"score\" the first goal in the new facility as part of the opening ceremony for the new. In 1986, he was presented with the Rangers' Alumni Association award, the first former Ranger to receive the award through a vote of alumni membership. \"The Hockey News\" ranked Cook as the 44th greatest player in NHL history, and highest Ranger on the list, in its 1998 book \"The Top 100 NHL Players of All Time\".\n\nAccepting a land grant from the federal government, Cook settled in Saskatchewan following the First World War, taking a half section of land adjacent to a similar holding of his brother Bun's. He established his farm near Lac Vert, hunted and played baseball during hockey off-seasons. He later returned to Kingston, Ontario, where he continued to farm and was nearly killed when one of his bulls gored him. Cook was married and had three children. He died of cancer in Kingston on May 5, 1986.\n\n"}

The 30% concentration is not approved for direct intravenous infusion, but should be mixed with amino acids and dextrose as part of a total nutrient admixture.\n\nIntralipid and other balanced lipid emulsions provide essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA), an omega-6 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid. The emulsion is used as a component of intravenous nutrition for people who are unable to get nutrition via an oral diet.\n\nLipid emulsions are effective in treating experimental models of severe cardiotoxicity from intravenous overdose of local anaesthetic drugs such as bupivacaine.\n\nThey have been effective in people unresponsive to the usual resuscitation methods. They have subsequently been used off-label in the treatment of overdose from other fat-soluble medications.\n\nPropofol is dissolved in a lipid emulsion for intravenous use. Sometimes etomidate (the vehicle for etomidate is propylene glycol) is supplied using a lipid emulsion as a vehicle.\n\nIntravenous lipid emulsions have been used experimentally since at least the 19th century. An early product marketed in 1957 under the name Lipomul was briefly used in the United States but was subsequently withdrawn due to side effects. Intralipid was invented by the Swedish physician and nutrition researcher Arvid Wretlind, and was approved for clinical use in Sweden in 1962. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration initially declined to approve the product due to prior experience with another fat emulsion. It was approved in the United States in 1972.\n\nIntralipid is also widely used in optical experiments to simulate the scattering properties of biological tissues.\nSolutions of appropriate concentrations of intralipid can be prepared that closely mimic the response of human or animal tissue to light at wavelengths in the red and infrared ranges where tissue is highly scattering but has a rather low absorption coefficient.\n\nIntralipid is currently being studied for its potential use as a cardioprotective agent, specifically as a treatment for ischemic reperfusion injury. The rapid return of myocardial blood supply is critical in order to save the ischemic heart, but it also has the potential to create injury due to oxidative damage (via reactive oxygen species) and calcium overload. Myocardial damage with the resumption of blood flow after an ischemic event is termed “reperfusion injury”.\n\nThe mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is normally closed during ischemia, but calcium overload and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) with reperfusion open mPTP allowing hydrogen ions to flow from the mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol. The hydrogen flux disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and results in mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, and the release of pro-apoptotic factors. These changes impair mitochondrial energy production and drive cardiac myocyte apoptosis.\n\nIntralipid (5mL/kg) provided five minutes before reperfusion delays the opening of mPTP in vivo rat models, making it a potential cardioprotective agent Lou et al. (2014) found that the cardioprotection aspect of Intralipid is initiated by the accumulation of acylcarnitines in the mitochondria and involves inhibition of the electron transport chain, an increase in ROS production during early (3 min) reperfusion, and activation of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway (RISK). The mitochondrial accumulation of acylcarnitines (primarily palmitoyl-carnitine) inhibits the electron transport chain at complex IV, generating protective ROS. The effects of ROS are both “site” and “time” sensitive, meaning that both will ultimately determine whether the ROS are beneficial or detrimental. The generated ROS, which are formed from electrons leaking from the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, first act directly on mPTP to limit opening. ROS then activate signalling pathways that act on the mitochondria to decrease mPTP opening and mediate protection. Activation of the RISK pathway by ROS increases the phosphorylation of other pathways, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, both of which are found in pools localized at the mitochondria. The Akt and ERK pathways converge to alter glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) activity. Specifically, Akt and ERK phosphorylate GSK-3β, inactivating the enzyme, and inhibiting the opening of mPTP. The mechanism by which GSK-3β inhibits the opening of the mPTP is controversial. Nishihara et al. (2007) proposed that it is achieved through interaction of GSK-3β with ANT subunit of mPTP, inhibiting the Cyp-D–ANT interaction, resulting in the inability of the mPTP to open.\n\nIn a study by Rahman et al. (2011) Intralipid-treated rat hearts were found to required more calcium to open mPTP during ischemia-reperfusion. The cardiomyocytes are therefore, better able to tolerate the calcium overload, and increase the threshold for opening of the mPTP with the addition of Intralipid.\n\n"}

He was an Allan Cup champion with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 1924 before embarking on a 13-year professional career. He played for the Saskatoon Crescents in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the New York Rangers and Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League (NHL). Cook was a member of two Stanley Cup championship teams with the Rangers, in 1928 and 1933, playing on the \"Bread Line\" with his brother Bill and Frank Boucher.\n\nCook turned to coaching in 1937 and spent 19 years in the American Hockey League (AHL), with the Providence Reds for six seasons and the remainder with the Cleveland Barons. His 636 wins as a coach is the most in AHL history and he led his teams to the playoffs in all but one season. Cook was named an AHL All-Star coach on six occasions, and led his teams to a record seven Calder Cup championships. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995 and to the AHL Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHe was the last surviving former player of the Saskatoon Crescents.\n\nFrederick Joseph Cook was born September 18, 1903, in Kingston, Ontario. He was part of a large family, and the second of three brothers, following Bill and preceding Alexander (\"Bud\"). Despite their eight-year difference age, Bun frequently followed Bill to new teams and the pair spent most of their careers playing together. Bun joined Bill in playing senior hockey with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in 1921, and while Bill had already left the team by that point, Bun was a member of the Greyhounds squad that won the Allan Cup in 1924 as senior champions of Canada. Following the championship, Bun turned professional by signing with the Saskatoon Crescents of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) for the 1924–25 season. Bill had already played two years in Saskatoon by that point and housed his younger brother during their shared tenure with the team.\n\nCook played two seasons in the Western League. He scored 17 goals in 28 games in 1924–25 and added eight more in 30 games the following season. The league had run into financial difficulty in its final seasons, and after 1926, ceased operations. The Montreal Maroons intended to sign both Cook and his brother Bill to join their team for the 1926–27 NHL season. While the team's manager waited in Montreal to meet the brothers, Conn Smythe, manager of the newly formed New York Rangers, travelled to Winnipeg to reach the pair first. Smythe signed both Cook brothers for $12,000. The brothers convinced Smythe to sign Frank Boucher, who also played in the WCHL, and the trio to form the \"Bread Line\", one of the early NHL's most prolific scoring lines.\n\nThe expansion Rangers made their debut on November 16, 1926. Cook assisted on the first goal in franchise history, scored by his brother, and which stood as the only marker in a 1–0 victory. During the season, Cook earned his nickname \"Bun\" from a journalist who claimed he was \"quick as a bunny\" on the ice. He finished the 1926–27 season with 23 points in 44 games then improved to 28 points in 1927–28. Cook led the Rangers with 14 assists on the year. The Rangers finished second in the American Division that season and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Bruins to reach the 1928 Stanley Cup Final against the Maroons. The Bread Line scored every Rangers goal in the series. The second game was notable for having Rangers coach Lester Patrick play goal after regular goaltender Lorne Chabot was injured. New York won that game, 2–1, and went on to capture the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.\n\nCook's offence declined in 1928–29 as he recorded only 18 points. Attempting to defend their championship, the Rangers reached the 1929 Stanley Cup Final, but were defeated by the Boston Bruins. The 1929–30 season was statistically Cook's best in professional hockey. He finished tenth in the NHL with 24 goals and totaled 43 points in 44 games. Following a 35-point season in 1930–31, he was named to the inaugural NHL All-Star Team as the second team left wing. Cook scored 34 points the following season. The Rangers won the American Division title and reached the 1932 Stanley Cup Final but lost the series to the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nWith 22 goals in 1932–33, Cook finished fourth in the NHL, while his 37 points were seventh best. The Rangers reached the 1933 Stanley Cup Final, and Cook had two opportunities to end the series in the deciding fourth game: He was unable to score on a breakaway late in regulation time, while he and Bill nearly teamed up to end the contest early in overtime. Bill ultimately scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory as the Rangers won their second Stanley Cup championship.\n\nCook was a consistent scorer the following two seasons as he recorded 33 points in 1933–34 and 34 points in 1934–35. However, he missed much of the 1935–36 season due to an arthritic condition. Believing he would not recover, the Rangers sold Cook to the Boston Bruins. The transaction broke up the Bread Line, which had been together for nine seasons. He appeared in 40 games for the Bruins in 1936–37, his final NHL season, and recorded nine points.\n\nIn 531 career professional games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He was also an early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: \"I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We got a lot of goals off the crisscross and drop pass.\" Ed Sullivan, then of the \"New York Graphic\", praised Cook's creativity: \"When Bun Cook is hot, he is one of the most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination.\" In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).\n\nAfter retiring from the NHL in 1937, Cook turned to coaching and became the head coach of the Providence Reds in the International-American Hockey League (IAHL; later the American Hockey League, AHL). He guided the Reds to a record and a first-place finish in the Eastern Division, as well as a Calder Cup championship after the Reds defeated the Syracuse Stars. Following the 1938–39 season, Cook was named to the IAHL/AHL All-Star team for the first time of four consecutive seasons. In 1942, Cook served as coach of the Eastern Division team at the first AHL All-Star Game. He coached the Reds for six seasons, until 1942–43. The Reds won three division titles and a second Calder Cup in 1940. Occasionally pressed into playing duty, Cook also appeared in 37 games for the Reds over that time, and recorded what ultimately was his final professional goal, the game-winner in a 3–2 victory over the New Haven Eagles on December 17, 1942.\n\nCook left Providence to become head coach of the Cleveland Barons in 1943–44. The Barons won their division six times in Cook's first nine seasons as coach. They reached the Calder Cup Final on six occasions in that time and won three championships: in 1944–45, 1947–48 and 1950–51. He was considered a favourite to become head coach of the Boston Bruins in 1950, but never left Cleveland. In 1952–53, Cook coached the Barons to both the regular season championship and the Calder Cup as the Barons defeated the Pittsburgh Hornets by a 1–0 score in overtime of the seventh, and deciding, game of the series. Cook coached the Barons to a repeat championship in 1953–54, his seventh Calder Cup victory. With a record of 26–31–7, 1955–56 season was the first in 13 seasons with the Barons that Cook coached the team to a losing record. Though the team reached the league championship series, the Barons opted to relieve Cook of his position as coach.\n\nCook spent one season coaching the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Northern Ontario Hockey League, in 1956–57, then spent three seasons with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Eastern Professional Hockey League until his retirement in 1961. Cook retired as, and remains, the most successful coach in AHL history. His seven Calder Cups are four more than anyone else, and his 636 career wins is the most in league history. He was inducted into the American Hockey League Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nBill Cook was given a land grant following the First World War, and became a farmer on a half section of land near Lac Vert, Saskatchewan. Bun followed his elder brother to the prairie province and farmed an adjacent half section. Following his career in hockey, Cook ultimately returned to his hometown of Kingston where he died on March 19, 1988.\n"}

He was signed as a free agent by the Boston Red Sox in season and spent the season with the Pawtucket Red Sox. He returned to the Phillies organization the following year as a minor league free agent. Played most of the season with Scranton before his contract was purchased by the Phillies in September. 1998 was his first full season in the majors and he stayed with the Phillies as a backup catcher to Mike Lieberthal until he was traded to the New York Mets for fellow catcher Todd Pratt on July 23, .

He hit no other home runs that season.\n\nOn November 28, 2006, Bennett was re-signed by the Cardinals.\n\nOn November 2, , the Cardinals exercised their buy-out option on his contract.\n\nOn December 13, 2007, Bennett was named in the Mitchell Report, which detailed his illegal use of performance-enhancing substances such as human growth hormone.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, the Dodgers signed Bennett to a one-year deal to back up Russell Martin, the Dodgers' young All-Star catcher. After signing, Bennett publicly admitted that the Mitchell Report was accurate as far as he was concerned, stating, \"As far as the report is concerned to me, it's accurate. Obviously, it was a stupid decision. It was a mistake.\" Bennett's 2008 season was cut short, however, when he went on the disabled list in mid-May for plantar fasciitis. The ailment would keep Bennett on the disabled list the remainder of the season. Veteran backup Danny Ardoin took Bennett's spot in his absence as Martin's backup. Bennett finished the 2008 campaign with a disappointing .190 batting average with one home run and four RBI in only 10 games played. After the season the Dodgers bought out Bennett's option year, making him a free agent.\n\n\n"}

The location of \"Surface Ground Zero\" is . The depth of the test cavity was approximately below the ground surface. It was part of the Operation Mandrel weapons test series under the name Mandrel Rulison, as well as the Operation Plowshare project which explored peaceful engineering uses of nuclear explosions. The peaceful aim of Project Rulison was to determine if natural gas could be easily liberated from underground regions. This site remains under active monitoring by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management.\n\nThe test succeeded in liberating large quantities of natural gas; however the resulting radioactivity left the gas contaminated and unsuitable for applications such as cooking and heating homes. Although projected public radiation exposures from commercial use of stimulated gas had been reduced to less than 1% of background, it became clear in the early 1970s that public acceptance within the U.S. of any product containing radioactivity, no matter how minimal, was difficult if not impossible. The Department of Energy began a cleanup of the site in the 1970s which was completed in 1998. A buffer zone put in place by the state of Colorado still exists around the site. A January 2005 report by the DOE stated that radioactivity levels were normal at the surface and in groundwater, though a later report due in 2007 was expected to more fully explore if there was subsurface contamination and whether or not radioactivity was still spreading outward from the blast site itself.\n\nAs of June 2005, the Houston, Texas-based company Presco was seeking to drill for natural gas within the buffer zone, putting in as many as four wells. The company had initially received approval to drill one well, but the county dropped its support when more extensive plans were revealed.\n\nThis was the second of three natural-gas-reservoir stimulation test in the Plowshare program. The other two were Project Gasbuggy and Project Rio Blanco.\n\nA placard, erected in 1976, now marks the site where the blast took place.

{"id": "1989377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989377", "title": "Buddhist Churches of America", "text": "Buddhist Churches of America\n\nThe Buddhist Churches of America (abbreviated as BCA in English, \"\" or \"Beikoku Bukkyōdan\" in Japanese) is the United States branch of the Nishi Honganji subsect of Jōdo Shinshū (\"True Pure Land School\") Buddhism. Jōdo Shinshū is also popularly known as \"Shin Buddhism\". The BCA is one of several overseas \"kyōdan\" (\"districts\") belonging to the Nishi (\"Western\") Honganji. The other \"kyōdan\" are Hawaii, Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada, and South America.\n\nThe BCA's headquarters is at 1710 Octavia Street, San Francisco, near Japantown. It is the oldest Buddhist organization in the mainland United States.\n\nThe origins of the Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) or American Buddhist Churches (ABC) began with the arrival of Japanese immigrants to the American mainland during the late 1800s. Devout Shin Buddhists who had expressed concern over the lack of religious services, and the activities of Christian missionaries among the newly-arrived immigrant population, petitioned the \"monshu\" (head abbot) of the Nishi Honganji to send priests to the US. The first Jōdo Shinshū priests arrived in San Francisco in 1893, and the first American temple constructed in 1899. The priests' arrival was a source of concern to the Japanese consul to the U.S. who believed it would strain U.S.-Japan relations: for example, a hostile article by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" newspaper on their arrival alleged that the priests' intent was to convert white Americans and proclaim that Buddhism was superior to Christianity. In the decades prior to World War II, the mainland American branch of the Nishi Honganji tradition was named the \"Buddhist Missions of North America\" (BMNA), and many temples were established throughout the West Coast, the first being in San Francisco, followed by temples in the Bay Area, the Central Valley, and Northern and Southern California. There were also temples established in the Northwest states, in Seattle, Washington and Oregon. Since the majority of early Japanese immigrants or issei (\"First Generation\") were farmers or laborers, many of these temples were built in then-rural, and segregated, areas such as Dinuba, Guadalupe, and Sacramento.\n\nAn earlier separate branch of the Nishi Hongwanji-ha was established on the Hawaiian Islands in the 1880s when it was the Kingdom of Hawaii, the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii. Many Japanese had also immigrated to Hawaii to work on the plantations there.\n\nThe activities of the BMNA focused solely on the Japanese immigrant community and their families. Priests were expected to conduct funeral and memorial services, teach Buddhism together with traditional Japanese culture, and also to serve as role models for young Japanese men, as at the time they were often considered the most educated Japanese immigrants. Many of these priests only stayed temporarily in the US, then returned to Japan after serving for a period of a few years; others stayed on in the US temples (a trend that continues today among many priests who are Japanese nationals). Worship services were in the Japanese language, and Japanese-language and English-language schools were common at many temples. Auxiliary temple organizations such as the Young Buddhist Association (YBA) and Buddhist Women's Association (BWA), common in Japan, were also established in America to enhance the feeling of \"sangha\" and ethnic solidarity. Many temples also emphasized American civic principles: Boy Scout chapters were active in temples before and after World War II.\n\nThe desire to assimilate into mainstream American society created changes in traditional Japanese Buddhist religious architecture and ritual and culture in order to conform to the predominant Protestant Christian religion: temples resembled Christian churches in their interior style and design (replacing \"tatami\" mats with pews and introducing lecterns), and supplemented traditional Shinshu liturgy with introduction of Western musical instruments (organs and pianos) in services, singing of \"gathas\" modeled after Christian hymns and male and female choirs. These changes remain today and are considered the norm for American Jōdo Shinshū temples.\n\nAlthough the focus of temple life emphasized Japanese religious practices and culture, there was a very limited outreach to non-Japanese Americans interested in Buddhism. A few white (\"hakujin\") members were admitted into BMNA temples, and a notable few, such as the Rev. Sunya Pratt of Tacoma, Washington, and Rev. Julius Goldwater (a relative of Senator Barry Goldwater) from Los Angeles, even became ordained in the Shin tradition in the U.S. prior to World War II. In 2006, Dr. Gordon Bermant, from Ekoji Buddhist Temple, became the president of the Buddhist Churches of America, the first non-Japanese-American to hold this position.\n\nThe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent entry of America into World War II had a devastating impact on the US Jōdo Shinshū temples, which lingers to the present day. War hysteria, economic jealousies, and racism led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order 9066 which called for the removal of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast and placement into \"internment\" camps. Temples were closed and many Japanese-American Buddhist families hid or destroyed their butsudans (home altars), and other religious items. Jōdo Shinshū priests were arrested by the FBI since they were viewed as community leaders, and were imprisoned separate from their sanghas. However, Buddhist services were allowed to be conducted within the internment camps.\n\nThe term \"churches\" in the name of the sect derives historically from the desire of Japanese immigrant Buddhists to be accepted into North American society and to avoid attracting hostility and discrimination, especially after the internment of Japanese Americans. The name was changed from the BMNA to Buddhist Churches of America in 1944 at the Topaz War Relocation Center. During the internment period, many Japanese-Americans enlisted in the United States Army to prove their loyalty and in the belief that it would end the incarceration of their families. The BCA also petitioned the War Department to have a Buddhist military chaplain assigned to the segregated Japanese-American units, such as the 442nd Infantry Regiment, but this request was denied since Buddhism was not recognized as a religion (at the time only Protestant Christian, Catholic Christian and Jewish chaplains were endorsed). Buddhist chaplains would not be accepted until 1987, when the BCA reapplied for and was granted official endorser status.\n\nFollowing the end of internment in 1946, Japanese-Americans returned to the West Coast and what was left of their former homes, and most temples were reopened. Relations with the Nishi Honganji in Japan were also reestablished.\n\nAfter World War II, the newly reorganized Buddhist Churches of America temples resumed traditional Jōdo Shinshū rituals and services, and served as a refuge from continuing racial discrimination in wider American society. For this reason, there was little or no desire by many Japanese-American ‘’sanghas’’ in propagating Jōdo Shinshū, with few exceptions. The internment legacy also created a stronger desire to assimilate into mainstream American society by many nisei (\"second generation\"). The nisei soon replaced the issei in BCA ministry and leadership positions, and English was used more frequently in services and meetings. During the next several decades, as Buddhism became more widely known and accepted in American society, particularly Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism continued to remain unknown, or misunderstood as an ethnic or \"Christianized\" form of Buddhism. This view is gradually changing as the organization's membership is becoming more ethnically diverse due to the growing American interest in Buddhism and intermarriage among the sansei (\"Third Generation\") and yonsei (\"Fourth Generation\") families, who continue to constitute the majority of sangha membership. English is the predominant language spoken at BCA temples, although some Japanese-language-only services and classes are still held. Shōmyō (the chanting of sutras) is still in the Japanese language; some temples have attempted to create English-language \"shōmyō\".\n\nThe BCA continues to struggle with the legacy of internment and the effects of cultural assimilation as it confronts many serious issues: temples which are in isolated rural or deteriorating urban areas (which were formerly Japanese-American enclaves), a dwindling membership, lack of interest by young Japanese-Americans in Jōdo Shinshū and misconceptions of their doctrine within American Buddhism. There are also ongoing debates regarding the adaptation and change of traditional Shin doctrine to Western ideas of Buddhism, such as whether or not temples should offer more diverse forms of meditation in addition to chanting meditation, in order to attract new members, who would not be ethnic Japanese. However, it is hoped that ongoing American interest in the Dharma will lead to a new interest in Jōdo Shinshū and its revival in the United States. The BCA has attempted to accomplish this goal chiefly through academia, \"minister's assistant\" training, and through cultural events open to the public, such as the Bon Festival, taiko, and Japanese food bazaars. BCA was among the first American Buddhist communities to sanction same-sex marriage.\n\nThe majority of BCA temples are in California, although there are other temples and \"howakai\" (\"Jodo Shinshu Dharma Associations\") in Washington, Idaho/Oregon, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. The BCA is administratively and regionally divided into eight districts: San Francisco Bay, Northern California, Coast, Southern, Central California, Mountain States, Eastern, and Northwest. Each district may sponsor its own yearly conferences, lectures, and social and religious events. The BCA also publishes a bilingual monthly newspaper, \"Wheel of Dharma\".\n\nIn the United States, BCA priests may be addressed as either \"sensei\" (\"teacher\"), \"Minister,\" or \"Reverend.\" BCA ministers have historically been all male and ethnically Japanese, but there is now a substantial number of female, and non-Japanese, ministers. BCA minister's dress or \"koromo\" includes the full-length black \"fuho\", which is the everyday priest's robe, and \"wagesa\", a type of stole which is said to symbolize the original Buddhist robe worn by Gautama Buddha. More formal robes include the \"kokue\", a heavier black robe with longer sleeves and pleated skirt, \"hakama\", and \"gojo-gesa\", a colorful five-paneled apron which is draped over the \"kokue\". These are worn for major services such as the Bon Festival or Hōonkō. In Japan, Jōdo Shinshū priests typically wear a white \"hakue,\" or undershirt, under their robes, and \"tabi\", a traditional split-toe sock, but this is usually not worn in the United States. BCA ministers also carry Buddhist prayer beads with tassels said to symbolize a person's \"bonno\" or \"evil passions\" which one must be mindful of. They are similar to the \"mala\" in other Buddhist traditions. Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism does not have monastic vows (vinaya), so priests may marry: priests' spouses are called \"bomori,\" an archaic Japanese word which may mean \"temple helper.\" \"Bomori\" are very active in temple activities, and may also be ordained and assist in rituals and services.\n\nThe following is a list of Buddhist churches affiliated with the Buddhist Churches of America.\n\nThe Bay District centers around the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe Central District centers around the Southern San Joaquin Valley.\n\nThe Coast District covers the Santa Clara Valley and the central coast areas of California.\n\nThe Eastern District covers the states east of the Mississippi River.\n\nThe Mountain States District covers the Rocky Mountain states and the area between the Rockies and the Mississippi River.\n\nThe Northern California District centers in the Sacramento Valley and Northern California area.\n\nThe Northwest District includes Washington, Oregon, and Western Idaho.\n\nThe Southern District which includes Southern California, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThe BCA's American seminary, the Institute of Buddhist Studies (IBS), is located in Berkeley, California and is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union. This seminary and graduate school offers a Master of Arts in Buddhist Studies and offers on-line courses. BCA priests graduate from the IBS after three years and are ordained at the Nishi Hongwanji-ha in Kyoto, Japan in an evening ceremony called \"tokudo\". Most BCA priests receive additional ordination called \"kyoshi\" (which permits them to teach doctrine) and \"kaikyoshi\", literally \"overseas teacher\" which permits them to teach outside mainland Japan. A typical course of instruction for priesthood includes study of Jōdo Shinshū doctrine, history, and liturgy, courses in comparative religions, general overview of Buddhism, and some Japanese-language instruction. Recently the IBS introduced Buddhist-based courses for chaplaincy training in partnership with the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies.\n\nOn October 20, 2006, the Jōdo Shinshū Center located in downtown Berkeley was opened to function as a training center for ministerial candidates and assistants in the U.S., sponsor continuing education programs for priests and laymembers, and as a major site for the propagation of Shin Buddhism in North America. The Center is also the US headquarters of Ryukoku University, which is based in Kyoto.\n\nCurrently, the Buddhist Churches of America is the only Buddhist organization which can endorse chaplains of Buddhist faith for U.S Armed Forces, as recognized by the National Council on Ministry to the Armed Forces (NCMAF). The BCA may also endorse Buddhist chaplains for the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n"}

She is a 1974 recipient of a Distinguished Alumni Award of Case Western Reserve University's Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing.\n\nDuerk was born in Defiance, Ohio, on March 29, 1920, to Albert and Emma Duerk. She had nursing training at Toledo (Ohio) Hospital School of Nursing, from which she received her diploma in 1941.\n\nOn January 23, 1943, she was appointed as an ensign in the Nurse Corps of the U.S. Naval Reserve. After receiving her commission in 1943, she was assigned in March of that year as a Ward Nurse at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia. In January 1944, she transferred, in a similar capacity, to the Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland and in May 1945 joined the That vessel, anchored off Eniwetok, received the sick and wounded brought back from Third Fleet operations against Japan and later joined the Third Fleet for its last strikes against the enemy. After the cessation of hostilities, that hospital ship remained in Japanese waters, off Yokosuka, to assist in the processing of liberated Allied prisoners of war. The \"Benevolence\" returned to the United States with wounded servicemen in late 1945. Assigned in January 1946 to the Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, Illinois, Durek continued duty there until June of that year, when she was released from active naval service.\n\nShe attended the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, from which she received the degree of Bachelor of Science in Ward Management and Teaching, Medical and Surgical Nursing, in 1948. Employed as Supervisor and Instructor, Medical Nursing, at Highland Park (Michigan) General Hospital, she remained there until 1951. While there, she joined a ready naval reserve unit in Detroit, Michigan, in 1948.\n\nOrdered to return to active naval service, she reported in June 1951, as a ward nurse at the Naval Hospital, Portsmouth, Virginia. Transferred in September 1951 to the Naval Hospital Corps School, Portsmouth, she was a Nursing Instructor there until October 1956, when she became Interservice Education Coordinatorat the Naval Horpital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From June 1958 to May 1961 she served as Nurse Programs Officer at the Naval Recruiting Station, Chicago, Illinois, after which she had duty as Charge Nurse at the U. S. Naval Station Hospital, Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines. In April 1962 she was assigned as Assistant Chief Nurse at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan.\n\nDuring the period May 1963 to June 1965 she was the Senior Nurse Corps Officer at the Naval Station Dispensary, Long Beach, California. Following an assignment as Chief of the Nursing Branch at the Naval Hospital Corps School, San Diego, California, she reported in May 1966 as Assistant for Nurse Recruitment in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health and Medical), Washington, D. C. She remained there until May 1967, then had duty until February 1968 as Assistant Head of Medical Placement Liaison (Nurse Corps), Bureau of Naval Personnel, Navy Department. She next returned to the Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, where she became Director of the Navy Nurse Corps, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Navy Department.\n\nAdvancing progressively in rank, she attained that of captain on July 1, 1967. She became the first female admiral in the Navy in 1972.\n\nDuerk retired in 1975. She died in Central Florida on July 21, 2018, at the age of 98.\n\nDuerk received the following honorary degrees:\n\nIn 2013 the University of Central Florida College of Nursing unveiled a bronze statue of Duerk, and it was put on display there. That university also offers the Rear Admiral Alene Duerk VNA Endowed Nursing Scholarship.\n\nHaving heard of her promotion to Rear Admiral on the radio in her car, a toll booth operator was the first person Duerk spoke to about it. But by the time she had gotten home, family was already calling and the press was waiting for her. From that time on, she felt that she was not only an admiral, she was a spokeswoman for all the women in the Navy. In that role, she frequently made appearances and statements in support of her Navy women, fighting for increases in pay, better conditions and recruiting nurses.\n\nAfter retirement, she joined the board of the Visiting Nurse Association in the early 1990s, which later became the Visiting Nurse Foundation in 1997, serving on the board for nearly 25 years. The board established the Admiral Alene Duerk Endowed Scholarship Fund at University of Central Florida in her honor.\n\nAlthough she was very close to her family, Duerk never married or had children of her own.\n\n\n"}

He twice won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's MVP.\n\nAfter a few seasons of senior league play in Ottawa and Halifax, Cowley broke in as a rookie with the St. Louis Eagles in 1934–35. After the season, the franchise was terminated and Art Ross, the general manager of the Bruins, selected him in the subsequent dispersal draft.\n\nIn Boston he would become a star, leading the league in assists in 1939 (despite missing twelve games with injuries), 1941 and 1943, and helping to lead the Bruins to two Stanley Cups in 1939 and 1941. While World War II ravaged the Bruins' powerful roster thereafter—Boston would not win another Cup during his career—Cowley was the team's sole remaining star. Frequently injured, he was on track to shatter the league record for scoring in 1944 when another injury ended his season two points short. Nevertheless, Cowley did score four goals in a game on March 4, 1944, in a wild 10–9 Boston victory over the New York Rangers.\n\nCowley finished his career with 195 goals and 353 assists for 548 points in 549 NHL games. On April 5, 1947, at the Bruins annual breakup party, Cowley unexpectedly announced he was leaving hockey because general manager Art Ross had chosen to leave him off of the roster for a post-season exhibition tour of western Canada and the United States. Cowley's wife was from Vancouver and he wanted to use the trip as a honeymoon. At the time of his retirement, he was the NHL's all-time leading point scorer, and the last active player from the St. Louis Eagles roster.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1968, as the sole inductee into the Players category that year. In 1998, he was ranked number 53 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\n\nAfter his career, Cowley went on to coach in the Ottawa senior leagues and the Vancouver Canucks of the PCHL.\n\nReturning to Ottawa after his coaching days, Cowley went into business, owning a hotel in Smiths Falls, Ontario and the Elmdale Tavern/Hotel in Ottawa. In 1967, he was a part-owner and founder of the Ottawa 67's junior ice hockey team. He passed on the Elmdale to his son John.\n\nCowley died on New Year's Eve, 1993, of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife Jessie (née Wilson), children Jill Fullerton, John, Jane Egan and Dan. He is buried in the hamlet of Norway Bay, Quebec, just south-east of his birthplace of Bristol, where he had a home and spent much of his retirement years.\n\n"}

He is credited with authorship of the \"Legend of the White Cowl\" and the Moscow - Third Rome prophecy, details of which are very scarce. He is popularly known as the presumed author of the concept of Moscow as the Third Rome; Philotheus set out this thesis in his letters to the priest and to the Grand Duke Vasily III.\n\nIn reality, these letters are mainly devoted to other issues, mostly talking about Church issues, and only refer to Moscow or Muscovy rather obliquely. Their main message in this regard is rather to remind the tzar about his ecclesiastical position of Protector of Faith, as the two previous capitals of Orthodoxy, Rome and Constantinople, both fell, first to the Latin heretics, and second to the Muslim heathens, with Moscow remaining its sole bastion. Philotheus prophecy could then best construed that the Muscovy (or Russia in general) will stand as far as it remains true to the Orthodox faith.\n\nHis alleged authorship of the essays \"On the Grievances of the Church\" to Ivan the Terrible, was refuted by scholars, as it contained elements of discrepancy with his first epistle. The person who wrote this essay, using the name of Philotheus, tied the theme of \"Third Rome\" to the protection of property rights of the church. \n\nIn August 2009, it was reported that archaeologists had discovered a grave in Pskov, allegedly belonging to Philotheus.\n"}

He was a two-time Stanley Cup champion, winning the trophy with the Bulldogs in 1913 and the Arenas in 1918. Crawford was one of the sport's early stars and appeared in 258 games in the three major leagues, scoring 110 goals. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nCrawford was born in Cardinal, Ontario, and played junior hockey in Vernon, near Ottawa, winning the Shaver Cup with the team in 1910. Following a stint playing amateur hockey in Verdun, Quebec, Crawford moved to Saskatchewan, settling in Prince Albert. He played with the Prince Albert Mintos of the Saskatchewan Professional Hockey League in 1910–11 where he scored 26 goals in 7 games. He joined the Saskatoon Hoo-Hoos for 1911–12. Both the Mintos and Hoo-Hoos issued challenges for the Stanley Cup in the year Crawford played with them, but his teams were eliminated from the competition by other teams before facing the holders of the trophy.\n\nReturning east, Crawford joined the defending Stanley Cup champion Quebec Bulldogs of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1912 and became a top scorer in the NHA during his time there. He won his first Stanley Cup in his first season, helping the Bulldogs defend their title against challenger from Sydney, Nova Scotia. Following the collapse of the NHA in 1917, the Bulldogs joined the newly formed National Hockey League, but chose not to operate in its first seasons. Crawford was claimed by the Ottawa Senators in a dispersal draft. He began the 1917–18 NHL season with Ottawa, but was loaned to the Toronto Arenas late in the season as the Senators were required to keep their roster within required limits after they signed Frank Nighbor to a contract. Completing the season in Toronto, Crawford and the Arenas won the Stanley Cup, defeating the Pacific Coast Hockey Association's Vancouver Millionaires in a five-game series. The Arenas signed Crawford to a new contract prior to the 1918–19 season, a deal that was protested by Ottawa who claimed that they retained his rights since he was only given to Toronto on loan. NHL president Frank Calder was required to arbitrate a resolution, and ordered the Toronto club to surrender one player of Ottawa's choice in exchange for Crawford. Following the season, Crawford returned to Saskatoon to play senior-amateur hockey with the Saskatoon Crescents.\n\nHe remained with Saskatoon while they turned into a professional team with the formation of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) in 1921. He was traded to the Calgary Tigers in 1922 for cash. By the time he joined the Tigers, he was already considered one of the game's all-time great players, and was regarded as one of the fastest skaters in Western Canada.\nHe won the WCHL championship in 1923–24, scoring one of Calgary's goals in a 2–0 victory over the Regina Capitals to clinch the title. He appeared in the 1924 Stanley Cup Final, where Calgary lost to the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAfter one more year in Calgary, Crawford was traded to the Vancouver Maroons in exchange for Fern Headley. After one year in Vancouver, he moved onto the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association for four seasons and was a member of their 1927–28 championship team. Crawford announced his retirement in 1930 at the age of 45. He coached one season of senior hockey with Prince Albert of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League in 1930–31 before leaving the sport for good. Crawford was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nCrawford was involved in several instances of rough play throughout his hockey career where he was reprimanded either by legal authorities or by league ruling. In 1910, while a member of the Prince Albert Mintos, he assaulted Reginald Brehaut of the Saskatoon Strathconas in a game in Saskatoon on January 11. Crawford was later found guilty of assault on January 19 in a Saskatoon city police court and fined $5 and costs.\n\nDuring the 1918–19 NHL season, in a game between the Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Arenas, Crawford, representing Toronto, assaulted Jack Darragh of the Ottawa club by striking him with his stick over the neck, and he was given a double major penalty (10 minutes) by referee Harvey Pulford. Previous to the attack on Darragh he had also slashed Frank Nighbor during the first period drawing a major penalty on the play. During the interval between the second and third period Sergeant Barlow of the Ottawa police department visited the Toronto dressing room and informed coach Dick Carroll of the Toronto Arenas that if he used Crawford in the upcoming period Crawford would be arrested for assaulting Darragh. Later on January 27 NHL president Frank Calder fined Crawford $25 for rough play based on referee Harvey Pulford's report.\n\nDuring the 1923–24 WCHL season Crawford, playing for the Calgary Tigers, was suspended one game by the league for assaulting Gordon Keats of the Edmonton Eskimos.\n\nCrawford ran into legal trouble in Vancouver in 1926 when he pleaded guilty to the theft of $550 at a party. He admitted taking the money, but intended to keep it only for safe keeping. He was given a suspended sentence.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Crawford farmed in the Spruce Home, Saskatchewan area. He sold his farm in 1960 and moved to Prince Albert, where he remained until his death in 1971.\n"}

Pluckley is mostly agricultural in land use and centred west of Ashford.\n\nReferences to Pluckley can be found in the \"Domesday Book\", at which time it was a more significant settlement than the now considerably larger town of Ashford.\n\nThe village's parish church, dedicated to St Nicholas, dates primarily to the 13th and 14th centuries. The Dering Chapel, separated from the rest of the church by two screens and found at the east end of the south aisle, was built in 1475. The nave contains brasses dedicated to members of the Dering family, all of which were made in the 1630s by Sir Edward Dering.\n\nSurrenden Manor was the former residence of Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet (1598–1644), who is buried locally, and it was here that the \"Dering Manuscript\", the earliest extant manuscript text of any Shakespearean play, was discovered.

Other reputed hauntings include a ghostly monk, a phantom highwayman and a gypsy woman who died in mysterious circumstances. Three of these are all within a few feet at the road junction ghost hunters have dubbed \"Fright Corner\". \"Dering\" or \"\"Screaming\"\" wood is also said to be a strong focus of paranormal activity.\n\nThe ITV drama series, \"The Darling Buds of May\", was filmed in the village (doubling for Sidcup) in the early 1990s.\n\nThe village's official status as \"the most haunted village in Britain\" has drawn many TV and radio series there.\n\nPluckley was also featured on an episode of BBC's \"Top Gear\". Two of the presenters, James May and Richard Hammond, were filming a review of the \"Smart Forfour\". The presenters spent 24 consecutive hours in the car, spending the night in the Screaming Woods.\n\nPluckley was the featured haunting in series 1, episode 9 of The ParaPod.

Each refrigerator model usually comes in two variations, namely a stainless steel exterior or a customizable exterior in an overlay or flush inset version. The customizable option allows the buyer to install kitchen cabinet panels on the door(s) to match with the rest of the kitchen. Its refrigerators are designed with a depth and can be installed flush with kitchen cabinets of the same standard depth to provide an integrated look. This kind of built-in refrigerator is usually wider than normal to compensate for the shallower depth in order to maintain acceptable storage volume.\n\nThe Sub-Zero 424 Wine Cooler has held virtually the same design since the early 1990s. It is the only under-counter wine cooler in its class to be able to keep wine as low as . It has two temperature zones and can be connected to a house alarm.\n\nA Sub-Zero refrigerator is heavier than most refrigerators offered by GE, Frigidaire, or LG. An average refrigerator weighs , but a Sub-Zero can weigh as much as and can require four delivery people to move the refrigerator unit into a kitchen, while most refrigerators usually only require two delivery people. Also, a typical Sub-Zero unit is taller than the basic home refrigerator. Most Sub-Zero full-size models are tall and wide.\n\nThe company currently has production facilities in Madison, Wisconsin; Phoenix, Arizona; Goodyear, Arizona; Richmond, Kentucky; and Fitchburg, Wisconsin.\n"}

The empire at its peak covered much of the north-eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. The rulers of the Sena Dynasty traced their origin to the south Indian region of Karnataka.\n\nThe dynasty's founder was Samanta Sena. After him came Hemanta Sena who usurped power and styled himself, king, in 1095 AD. His successor Vijaya Sena (ruled from 1096 AD to 1159 AD) helped lay the foundations of the dynasty, and had an unusually long reign of over 60 years. Ballala Sena conquered Gaur from the Pala, became the ruler of the Bengal Delta, and made Nabadwip the capital as well. Ballala Sena married Ramadevi a princess of the Western Chalukya Empire which indicates that the Sena rulers maintained close social contact with south India. Lakshmana Sena succeeded Ballala Sena in 1179, ruled Bengal for approximately 20 years, and expanded the Sena Empire to Odisha, Bihar and probably to Varanasi. In 1203–1204 AD, the Turkic general Bakhtiyar Khalji attacked Nabadwip. Khalji defeated Lakshman Sen and captured northwest Bengal – although Eastern Bengal remained under Sena control.\n\nThe political space after the decline of the Pala power in Bengal was occupied by the Senas whose king Vijayasena succeeded in conquering a large part of Pala territory. The Senas were the supporters of orthodox Hinduism. The dynasty traces its origin to the South, to the Western Chalukya Empire of southern India. There is a record of a Western Chalukya invasion during the reign of Someshvara I led by his son Vikramaditya VI who defeated the kings of Gauda and Kamarupa. This invasion of the Kannada ruler brought bodies of his countrymen from Karnataka into Bengal which explains the origin of the Sena Dynasty.\n\nThe founder of the Sena rule was Samantasena who described himself as a Brahmin-Kshatriya of Karnataka (Karnataka). He himself stated that he fought the outlaws of Karnataka and later turned an ascetic. The inscriptions of the Sena kings mention them as Brahma-Kshatriyas (Brahmins who ruled as Kshatriyas) or Kshatriyas. Also, sources have identified them with the Vaidya (as well as the Ambashtha caste or sub-caste, considered as a mixed caste, being born of Brahmin father and Vaishya mother,) and they married with and were identified with the Bengali Vaidyas (commonly known as Baidyas in Bengal) in Vaidya \"Kula-panjikas\" (family-tree accounts).\nTaking advantage of the revolt of Samantachakra in Varendra during the reign of Mahipala II, Vijayasena, founder of the Sena dynasty, gradually consolidated his position in western Bengal and ultimately assumed an independent position during the reign of Madanapala.\n\nThe Sena kings claim in their own inscriptions that they are Brahmakshatriya. Their remote ancestor was one Virasena, whose name was supposed to have been mentioned in Puranas. The \"Deopara Inscription\" of the Senas also traces the Sena ancestry from Virasena. Since there are no authentic records available still, a keen controversy prevails among scholars regarding origin of the Senas.\n\nLike the origin of the Senas, their early history or circumstances, which led them to concentrate in Bengal is also still unknown. It has been presumed by historians that the Senas came to Bengal on the eve of the invading army led by the Chalukya kings Vikramaditya VI and Someswara III. Some scholars have also suggested that when Rajendra Chola's army had invaded Bengal, the Senas had accompanied them. According to some other historians, a few Karnataka officials, who were subordinate to the Pala kings, had established their independent kingdom in the region of Radha, taking advantage of the weakness of the Pala powers. Those Karnataka chiefs might have arrived in Bengal in wake of the Chalukya invasion and had settled into a kingdom of their own. According to historians Samantasena was such a chief who had established his independent kingdom in the Radha region of Bengal.\n\nSamantasena was a scion of the Sena family, who had distinguished himself through various warfares in South India. He had settled in Radha in Bengal, at an old age. He had also laid the foundation of the Sena family in Bengal. His son Hemantasena carved out an important kingdom in Radha, taking advantage of the decline of the Pala Empire. From their base in Radha, the Senas ultimately extended their powers over the whole of Bengal.\n\nA copperplate was found in the Adilpur or Edilpur pargana of Faridpur District in 1838 A.D. and was acquired by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, but now the copperplate is missing from the collection. An account of the copperplate was published in the \"Dacca Review\" and \"Epigraphic Indica\". The copperplate inscription is written in Sanskrit and in Ganda character, and dated 3rd jyaistha of 1136 \"samval\", or 1079 A.D. In the Asiatic Society's proceeding for January 1838, an account of the copperplate states that three villages were given to a Brahman in the third year of Keshava Sena. The grant was given with the landlord rights, which include the power of punishing the \"Chandrabhandas\" or Sundarbans, a tribe that lived in the forest. The land was granted in the village of Leliya in the Kumaratalaka mandala, which is situated in shatata-padamavati-visaya. The copperplate of Keshava Sena records that the king Vallala Sena carried away, from the enemies, the goddesses of fortune on palanquins (Shivaka), which elephant tusk staff supported; and also states that Vallala Sena's son, Lakshmana Sena (1179–1205), erected pillars of victory and sacrificial posts at Varanasi, Allahabad, and Adon Coast of the South Sea. The copperplate also describes the villages with smooth fields growing excellent paddy, the dancing and music in ancient Bengal, and ladies adorned with blooming flowers. The Edilpur copperplate of Keshava Sena records that the king made a grant in favour of Nitipathaka Isvaradeva Sarman for the inside of the \"subha-varsha\".\n\nThe Deopara Prashasti is a stone inscription eulogising the Sena kings, particularly Vijaya Sena, composed by the court poet Umapati Dhara.\n\nThe Sena rulers consolidated the caste system in Bengal. Although Bengal borrowed from the caste system of Mithila, caste was not so strong in Bengal as in Mithila.\n\nThe Sena dynasty is famous for building Hindu temples and monasteries, which include the renowned Dhakeshwari Temple in what is now Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nIn Kashmir, the dynasty also likely built a temple knows as Sankara Gaureshwara.\n\nThe Sena rulers were also great patrons of literature. During the Pala dynasty and the Sena dynasty, major growth in Bengali was witnessed. Some Bengali authors believe that Jayadeva, the famous Sanskrit poet and author of Gita Govinda, was one of the \"Pancharatnas\" (five gems) in the court of Lakshmana Sena.\nDhoyin – himself an eminent court poet of Sena dynasty – mentions nine gems (ratna) in the court of Lakshmana Sena, among whom were:\n\nAfter the Sena dynasty, the Deva dynasty ruled in eastern Bengal. The Deva dynasty was probably the last independent Hindu dynasty of Bengal.\n\n\nSources\n"}

The success of these albums was mild at best, and indicated a shift in Donovan's popularity away from the superstardom of the 1960s and towards a distinctly smaller fan base.

It accounts for magnetic interactions and retardation effects to the order of \"1/c\". When other quantum electrodynamic effects are negligible, this equation has been shown to give results in good agreement with experiment. It was originally derived from the Darwin Lagrangian but later vindicated by the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory and eventually quantum electrodynamics.\n\nThe Breit equation is not only an approximation in terms of quantum mechanics, but also in terms of relativity theory as it is not completely invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Just as does the Dirac equation, it treats nuclei as point sources of an external field for the particles it describes. For \"N\" particles, the Breit equation has the form (\"r\" is the distance between particle \"i\" and \"j\"):\n\nwhere\nis the Dirac Hamiltonian (see Dirac equation) for particle \"i\" at position r and \"φ\"(r) is the scalar potential at that position; \"q\" is the charge of the particle, thus for electrons \"q\" = −\"e\".\nThe one-electron Dirac Hamiltonians of the particles, along with their instantaneous Coulomb interactions 1/\"r\", form the \"Dirac-Coulomb\" operator. To this, Breit added the operator (now known as the (frequency-independent) Breit operator):\nwhere the Dirac matrices for electron \"i\": a(\"i\") = [α(\"i\"),α(\"i\"),α(\"i\")]. The two terms in the Breit operator account for retardation effects to the first order.\nThe wave function Ψ in the Breit equation is a spinor with 4 elements, since each electron is described by a Dirac bispinor with 4 elements as in the Dirac equation, and the total wave function is the tensor product of these.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian of the Breit equation, sometimes called the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian (\"H\") can be decomposed into the following practical energy operators for electrons in electric and magnetic fields (also called the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian) , which have well-defined meanings in the interaction of molecules with magnetic fields (for instance for nuclear magnetic resonance):\nin which the consecutive partial operators are:\nwhere:\nformula_13 \nand\nformula_14\n\n\n\n"}

The orchestra play and sing music from a variety of musical genres, ranging from pop, rock, punk to classical tunes, with humour long being a feature of their act. The UOGB has played at many international venues and festivals. They now brand themselves as \"George Hinchliffe's Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain\".\n\nThe orchestra was formed in 1985, soon after George Hinchliffe bought co-founder and friend Kitty Lux a ukulele for her birthday. According to Hinchliffe, the original idea was not to be comedy act, but to create a liberating musical forum where any style of music could be played, from funk to rock and roll to classical, and the ukulele was chosen for its musical versatility more than its novelty value. \"The humour only came in during the first gig, when we played in two keys by accident and were messing around, with the sheet music falling everywhere. I thought we should go with it.\" Their first gig was at the Roebuck pub, just off Trinity Church Square in London. The orchestra has since performed in many venues worldwide, including New York's Carnegie Hall (2009, 2012), the Sydney Opera House (2012), London's Royal Albert Hall (2008, 2012) and Glastonbury Festival (2005). TV appearances have included: Jools Holland's Hootenanny, BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms, \"Blue Peter\", \"The Slammer\", \"Richard & Judy\", \"This Morning\" and \"Skins\".\n\nThe Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain perform their gigs in a light-heartedly parody of a 'very prim and proper, staid sort-of orchestra', wearing traditional orchestra dress for performances, with the men in black tie (black suits and bow ties) and the women in smart evening wear, seated behind music stands. The orchestra consists of 'ukuleleators' playing instruments in various registers: sopranino, soprano, concert, tenor, baritone, and one of whom plays bass ukulele. Since 2005 UOGB has performed as an octet (sometimes a septet) “of all-singing, all-strumming ukulele players\". Kitty Lux, band member and co-founder with George Hinchliffe, died from cancer on 16 July 2017.\n\n\nThe group has a small number of individuals who regularly serve as substitutes:\n\n\n\nA typical UOGB concert is a eclectic mixture of songs and instrumentals ranging from the Sex Pistols and Nirvana to Bach and Beethoven; a mix of music genres, from classical music to punk, grunge, rock and roll, country and 'some oddities that don't quite fit anywhere'. In Europe and America the Orchestra are known for playing versions of famous rock songs and film themes, sometimes changing these so that the expectations of the audience are subverted. Sometimes a rock song will be changed into a jazz idiom, or sometimes several songs which are known from different genres are combined in one “soup of contrasts.” Regulars include Kate Bush's \"Wuthering Heights\" reworked as a swinging jazz number, Ennio Morricone's theme to \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Tchaikovsky's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", \"Anarchy in the UK\" performed in the style of Simon and Garfunkel, and the theme tune from \"Shaft\". The Orchestra also compose and perform their own pieces, as well as arranging medleys – for example, David Bowie's \"Life on Mars?\" is melded with \"My Way\", \"For Once in My Life\", \"Substitute\", and more. Comedic elements are incorporated with the musicianship, including up to five members playing a single ukulele and times when the group each goes its own way on a piece of music.\n\nThe group has shied away from featuring the music of George Formby, Britain's most famous ukulele musician; however, in recent years, they have included a version of his song \"Leaning on a Lamppost\", performed in a Russian Cossack style.\n\nOn Tuesday 18 August 2009 the UOGB performed in a late night prom in the BBC Proms 2009 Season at the Royal Albert Hall. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and received much critical acclaim. This concert included a version of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" in which at least 1000 audience members participated with Ukuleles. A DVD of the performance, \"Prom Night\", was released the same year.\n\nThe orchestra has toured the US, Canada, Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Norway, Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nRecent years have seen television appearances on programmes such as Jools Holland's \"Hootenanny\" and \"Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway\" performing alongside Robbie Williams. High praise has been forthcoming from the press for live shows. The orchestra performed at the 50th anniversary VE day celebrations in Hyde Park (with Cliff Richard and Vera Lynn), before an estimated audience of 170,000, in 1995.\n\nOften the orchestra will provide advance notice of an audience participation number. They provide a link to the piece online so that those that wish to participate can come prepared.\n\nIn 2008, the group performed \"Dreamspiel\", a ukulele opera, composed by George Hinchliffe and Michelle Carter for the Grimeborn Festival at London's Arcola Theatre. They have also, in 2010 and 2011, performed \"Ukulelescope\" where they played music to accompany silent movies from the British Film Institute archives. In 2012, \"Waly Waly on the Ukulele\" reworked arrangements of Cecil Sharp's collected folk tunes for performances at the Birmingham Town Hall and Cecil Sharp House in London. (Recordings from these shows were released in 2016 as the CD \"The Keeper\".) In 2013 they issued a special collaboration with Ibiza Air for their Cover of the Song \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". They released an EP with 4 Remixes in different styles like Tech house and Chill-out. In 2014, to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of The Great War, the orchestra presented \"When This Lousy War is Over\" which reflected a range of attitudes from the time; patriotic, pacifist and feminist, and drew from gipsy music, music hall, soldiers' songs and even a song from the then radical avante-garde Cabaret Voltaire in neutral Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He became Prince of Taranto in her right in 1201 but died fighting before he could establish himself as King of Sicily.\n\nWalter III was the eldest son of Erard II of Brienne and Agnès of Montfaucon. He was likely born after 1166, and succeeded his father as Count of Brienne in 1191. In the late 1190s, Walter and his brothers became involved in the conflict between Peter II of Courtenay (first cousin of King Philip II of France) and Peter's vassal Hervé IV of Donzy.

Sicily was then controlled by the regents of the orphaned infant king Frederick, whose parents, Henry and Constance, had deposed Sibylla's family. King Philip II of France, having been approached by the former Sicilian queen, convened a meeting in Melun. It was agreed there that Elvira should be married to Walter. Philip thereby emphasized his authority over Walter while at the same time encouraging him to leave France. Walter reportedly received an impressive sum of 20,000 \"livre parisis\" from the King, though this is doubtful. For the House of Brienne, however, Walter's marriage to Elvira signified a sudden rise and the beginning of the dynasty's golden age.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade was launched by Walter's immediate suzerain, Count Theobald III of Champagne, in November 1199. Walter promptly took the cross and started persuading prospective crusaders, such as his cousin Walter of Montbéliard, to assist him in his upcoming campaign in southern Italy on their way to the Holy Land. Besides recruiting men, Walter energetically collected money and supplies from 1200, selling or mortgaging all of his land by April 1201. He also secured the blessing and significant aid from Pope Innocent III. Innocent was the guardian of King Frederick but determinedly opposed to his regents. He refused Walter's petition to recognize Elvira's claim to Frederick's throne; instead, he recognized the couple's right to the Principality of Taranto and the County of Lecce. In return, Tancred's family was compelled to recognize Frederick as their king. Walter knew that securing possession of Taranto and Lecce would give him a sufficient power base and agreed. \n\nLeaving his younger brother John in charge of Brienne, Walter arrived to the Italian Peninsula with a small army, including sixty knights and forty mounted sergeants. By the late spring of 1201, he had arrived to Frederick's realm and appeared victorious, having won battles at Capua and Cannae. Innocent urged Walter to cross to the island of Sicily. Walter was reluctant to combat Innocent's enemies on the island before consolidating his position on the peninsula. \n\nBy 1204, Walter was besieged in the fortress of Terracina by Diepold of Vohburg and lost an eye to an arrow, but he broke the siege and put Diepold to fight. One night in June 1205, a contingent of enemy soldiers infiltrated Walter's camp, cut the ropes of his tent, felled it on Walter and stabbed him. Walter died of his wounds soon afterwards, on 11 June 1205.\n\nElvira, pregnant at the time of Walter's death, quickly remarried. She gave birth to a posthumous son, Walter IV. Their family's claims posed problems for the rest of Frederick's reign. Walter III was succeeded in Brienne by his brother John, who held the county until Walter IV reached the age of majority.\n\n"}
{"id": "1989580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989580", "title": "Louisiana (New France)", "text": "Louisiana (New France)\n\nLouisiana () or French Louisiana was an administrative district of New France. Under French control 1682 to 1762 and 1801 (nominally) to 1803, the area was named in honor of King Louis XIV, by French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. It originally covered an expansive territory that included most of the drainage basin of the Mississippi River and stretched from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Appalachian Mountains to the Rocky Mountains.\n\nLouisiana included two regions, now known as Upper Louisiana (), which began north of the Arkansas River, and \"Lower Louisiana\" (). The U.S. state of Louisiana is named for the historical region, although it is only a small part of the vast lands claimed by France.\n\nFrench exploration of the area began during the reign of Louis XIV, but French Louisiana was not greatly developed, due to a lack of human and financial resources. As a result of its defeat in the Seven Years' War, France was forced to cede the east part of the territory in 1763 to the victorious British, and the west part to Spain as compensation for Spain losing Florida. France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. Strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte sold the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France's presence in Louisiana.\n\nThe United States ceded part of the Louisiana Purchase to the United Kingdom in the Treaty of 1818. This section lies above the 49th parallel north in a part of present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nIn the 18th century, Louisiana included most of the Mississippi River basin (see drawing alongside) from what is now the Midwestern United States south to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Within this vast territory, only two areas saw substantial French settlement: Upper Louisiana (), also known as the Illinois Country (), which consisted of settlements in what are now the states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana; and Lower Louisiana, which comprised parts of the modern states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Both areas were dominated numerically by Native American tribes. At times, fewer than two hundred [French] soldiers were assigned to all of the colony, on both sides of the Mississippi. In the mid-1720s, Louisiana Indians numbered well over 35,000, forming a clear majority of the colony's population.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the French colony of Louisiana bordered the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Michigan and Lake Erie towards the north; this region was the \"Upper Country\" of the French province of Canada. To the east was territory disputed with the British colonies on the Atlantic seaboard; the French claim extended to the Appalachian Mountains. The Rocky Mountains marked the western extent of the French claim, while Louisiana's southern border was the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe general flatness of the land aided movement through the territory; its average elevation is less than . The topography becomes more mountainous towards the west, with the notable exception of the Ozark Mountains, which are located in the mid-south.\n\nLower Louisiana consisted of lands in the Lower Mississippi River watershed, including settlements in what are now the U.S. states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The French first explored it in the 1660s, and a few trading posts were established in the following years; serious attempt at settlement began with the establishment of Fort Maurepas, near modern Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699. A colonial government soon emerged, with its capital originally at Mobile, later at Biloxi and finally at New Orleans (in 1722, four years after the city's founding). The government was led by a governor-general, and Louisiana became an increasingly important colony in the early 18th century.\n\nThe earliest settlers of Upper Louisiana mostly came from French Canada, while Lower Louisiana was colonized by people from all over the French colonial empire, with various waves coming from Canada, France, and the French West Indies.\n\nUpper Louisiana, also known as the Illinois Country, was the French territory in the upper Mississippi River Valley, including settlements and fortifications in what are now the states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. French exploration of the area began with the 1673 expedition of Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette, which charted the upper Mississippi. As noted above, Upper Louisiana was primarily settled by colonists from French Canada. There was further substantial intermarriage and integration with the local Illinois peoples. French settlers were attracted by the availability of arable farmland as well as by the forests, abundant with animals suitable for hunting and trapping.\n\nBetween 1699 and 1760, six major settlements were established in Upper Louisiana: Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Fort de Chartres, Saint Philippe, and Prairie du Rocher, all on the east side of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois; and Ste. Genevieve across the river in today's Missouri. The region was initially governed as part of Canada, but was declared to be part of Louisiana in 1712, with the grant of the Louisiana country to Antoine Crozat. By the 1720s a formal government infrastructure had formed; leaders of the towns reported to the commandant of Fort de Chartres, who in turn reported to the governor-general of Louisiana in New Orleans.\n\nThe geographical limits of Upper Louisiana were never precisely defined, but the term gradually came to describe the country southwest of the Great Lakes. A royal ordinance of 1722 may have featured the broadest definition: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes and north of the mouth of the Ohio River, which would include the Missouri Valley as well as both banks of the Mississippi.\n\nA generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northeastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to \"le Rocher\" on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present-day Rock Island, Illinois). Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana's reach. The outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana), and Prairie du Chien operated as dependencies of Canada.\n\nThis boundary remained in effect through the capitulation of French forces in Canada in 1760 until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Although British forces had occupied the \"Canadian\" posts in the Illinois and Wabash countries in 1761, they did not occupy Vincennes or the Mississippi River settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia until 1764, after the peace treaty was ratified.) As part of a general report on conditions in the newly conquered Province of Canada, Gen. Thomas Gage (then commandant at Montreal) explained in 1762 that, although the boundary between Louisiana and Canada was not exact, it was understood that the upper Mississippi (above the mouth of the Illinois) was in Canadian trading territory.\n\nFollowing the transfer of power (at which time many of the French settlers on the east bank of the Mississippi crossed the river to what had become Spanish Louisiana) the eastern Illinois Country became part of the British Province of Quebec, and later the United States' Northwest Territory. Those fleeing from British control founded outposts such as the important settlement of St. Louis (1764). This became a French fur-trading center, connected to trading posts on the Missouri and Upper Mississippi rivers, leading to later French settlement in that area.\n\nIn the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain, its ally in the war, as compensation for the loss of Spanish Florida to Britain. Even after France had lost its claim to Louisiana, settlement of Upper Louisiana by French-speakers continued for the next four decades. French explorers and frontiersmen, such as Pedro Vial, were often employed as guides and interpreters by the Spanish and later by the Americans. The Spanish lieutenant governors at St. Louis maintained the traditional \"Illinois Country\" nomenclature, using titles such as \"commander in chief of the western part and districts of Illinois\" and administrators commonly referred to their capital St. Louis \"of the Ylinuses\".\n\nIn 1800 Spain returned its part of Louisiana to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, but France sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Through this time, but especially following the Louisiana Purchase, French Creoles, as they called themselves, began to move further into the Missouri Ozarks, where they formed mining communities such as Mine à Breton and La Vieille Mine (Old Mines).\n\nA unique dialect, known as Missouri French, developed in Upper Louisiana. It is distinguished from both Louisiana French and the various forms of Canadian French, such as Acadian. The dialect continued to be spoken around the Midwest, particularly in Missouri, through the 20th century. It is nearly extinct today, with only a few elderly speakers still able to use it.\n\nIn 1660, France started a policy of expansion into the interior of North America from what is now eastern Canada. The objectives were to locate a Northwest Passage to China; to exploit the territory's natural resources, such as fur and mineral ores; and to convert the native population to Catholicism. Fur traders began exploring the \"pays d'en haut\" (upper country around the Great Lakes) at the time. In 1659, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers reached the western end of Lake Superior. Priests founded missions, such as the Mission of Sault Sainte Marie in 1668. On May 17, 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began the exploration of the Mississippi River, which they called the \"Sioux Tongo\" (the large river) or \"Michissipi\". They reached the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then returned upstream, having learned that the great river ran toward the Gulf of Mexico, not toward the Pacific Ocean as they had presumed. In 1675, Marquette founded a mission in the Native American village of \"Kaskaskias\" on the Illinois River. A permanent settlement was made by 1690.\n\nIn 1682, Cavelier de La Salle and the Italian Henri de Tonti descended to the Mississippi River Delta. They left Fort Crèvecoeur on the Illinois River, accompanied by 23 Frenchmen and 18 Indians. They built Fort Prud'homme (later the city of Memphis) and claimed French sovereignty on the whole of the valley, which they called \"Louisiane\" in honor of the Louis XIV of France. They sealed alliances with the Quapaw Indians. In April 1682, they arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi. La Salle eventually returned to Versailles, where he convinced the Minister of the Marine to grant the command of Louisiana to him. He claimed that Louisiana was close to New Spain by drawing a map showing the Mississippi as much farther west than it really was.\n\nWith four ships and 320 emigrants, La Salle set sail for Louisiana. La Salle did not find the river's mouth in the Mississippi River Delta and tried to establish a colony on the Texas coast. La Salle was assassinated in 1687 by members of his exploration party, reportedly near what is now Navasota, Texas.\n\n\nIt was not easy for an absolute monarchy to administer Louisiana, a territory several times larger than European France. Louis XIV and his successors tried to impose their absolutist ambitions on the colony, often without giving the colonial administration enough financial means to do its work.\n\nIf the leaders of \"Ancien Régime\" took control of, and sometimes encouraged, the colonization of New France, it was for many reasons. The reign of Henry IV gave an important impetus to the colonisation of New France. Henry IV, the first Bourbon king, was personally interested in foreign affairs. In the 17th century, the ministers Richelieu and later Colbert advanced colonial politics. Louis XIV and his ministers were worried about the size of the kingdom, over which they constantly competed with other European nations. European rivalry and a game of political alliances greatly marked the history of Louisiana, in direct and indirect ways. Within those shifting conditions, the French desire to limit British influence in the New World was a constant in royal politics.\n\nLouis XIV took care to limit the appearance of intermediary bodies and countervailing powers in North America. He did not want an assembly of notables or parliament. In the 1660s, the colony was royal property. In 1685, Louis XIV banned all publishing in New France. Between 1712 and 1731, the French possession came under the control of Antoine Crozat, a rich businessman, then under that of the Mississippi Company (created by John Law), which recruited immigrants to settle the colony. In 1731, Louisiana reverted to royal rule.\n\nIn contrast to Metropolitan France, the government applied a single unified law of the land: the Custom of Paris for civil law (rather egalitarian for the time); the \"Code Louis\", consisting of the 1667 ordinance on civil procedure and 1670 ordinance on criminal procedure; the 1673 \"Code Savary\" for trade; and the 1685 \"Code noir\" for slavery. This served as an equaliser for a while; riots and revolts against authority were rare. But, the centralised government had difficulty maintaining communications over the long distance and sailing time that separated France from Louisiana. Toward the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th, the colonists on the Gulf of Mexico were left almost completely to fend for themselves; they counted far more on the assistance of the Native Americans than on France. The distance had its advantages: the colonists smuggled goods into the colony with impunity.\n\nJean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's Minister of the Navy and Trade, was eager to stuff the coffers of the Crown. He dissolved the trading companies and took care to increase the production of the country and the colonies. Being a mercantilist, he believed it was necessary to sell as much as possible and to reduce reliance on imports. He imposed a French monopoly on trade. Colbert wanted to reduce the expenditure of the monarchy. It was, however, necessary to invest much money and to mobilize important human resources retain the American colony. Much work was done on the economic infrastructure (factories, ports) in metropolitan France, but the investment was not enough in Louisiana. No plan to facilitate the movement of goods or men was ever carried out. The French budget was exhausted because of the wars in Europe, but the colonists in Louisiana did not have to pay royal taxes and were free of the hated \"gabelle\".\n\nUnder the Ancien Régime, Louisiana formed part of a larger colonial unit, French American territory—New France (\"Nouvelle France\"), which included a large part of modern-day Canada. New France was initially ruled by a viceroy in 1625, the Duke of Ventadour. The colony was then given a government like the Bourbons' other possessions. Its capital was Quebec City until 1759. A governor-general, assisted by a single intendant, was charged with ruling this vast region. In theory, Louisiana was subordinate to Canada, and so it was explored and settled chiefly by French-Canadians rather than colonists from France. Given the enormous distance between New Orleans and Quebec, communications outside cities and forts were limited.\n\nFrench settlements were widely dispersed, which afforded them \"de facto\" autonomy. The government decided to break up governance of the vast varied colony of New France into five smaller provinces, including Louisiana. The Illinois Country, south of the Great Lakes, was added to Louisiana in 1717 and became known as Upper Louisiana. Mobile served as French Louisiana's first \"capital\". The seat of government moved to Biloxi in 1720, and then to New Orleans in 1722, where the governor lived. While the office of governor general was the most eminent, it was not the most powerful. His was a military position that required him to lead the troops and maintain diplomatic relations. The second provincial authority was the commissaire-ordonnateur. His was a civil post with similar functions as that of the intendants in France: the king's administrator and representative, he oversaw justice, the police force, and finances. He managed the budget, set prices, presided the Superior Council (\"Conseil supérieur\"—the court of justice), and organized the census. Appointed by the king, Louisiana's commissaire-ordonnateur had broad powers that sometimes conflicted with those of the governor general. The military outposts of the hinterland were directed by commanders.\n\nThe French possessions of North America were under the authority of a single Catholic diocese, whose seat was in Quebec. The archbishop, named and paid by the king, was spiritual head of all New France. With loose religious supervision, the fervor of the population was very weak; Louisianans tended to practice their faith much less than did their counterparts in France and Canada. The tithe, a tax by the clergy on the congregations, produced less revenue than in France.\n\nThe Church nevertheless played an important part in the exploration of French Louisiana; it sent missions, primarily carried out by Jesuits, to convert Native Americans. It also founded schools and hospitals: By 1720, the Ursulines were operating a hospital in New Orleans. The church and its missionaries established contact with the numerous Amerindian tribes. Certain priests, such as Father Marquette in the 17th century, took part in exploratory missions. The Jesuits translated collections of prayers into numerous Amerindian languages to convert the Native Americans. They also looked for ways to relate Indian practices to Christian worship, and helped show the Natives how these were related. A syncretic religion developed among new Christians. Sincere and permanent conversions were limited in number; many who received missionary instruction tended to assimilate the Holy Trinity into their belief of \"spirits\", or rejected the concept outright.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the total population of France's colonies in North America. While historians have relatively precise sources regarding the colonists and enslaved Africans, estimates of Native American peoples is difficult. During the 18th century, the society of Louisiana became quite creolized.\n\nColonial French (commonly known as Colonial Louisiana French) is a variety of Louisiana French. It is associated with the misnomer the Cajun French dialect and with Louisiana Creole French, a related creole language. Spoken widely in what is now the U.S. state of Louisiana, it is now considered to have been relabeled as \"Cajun French\".\n\nColonial French is conventionally described as the form of French spoken in Lower French Louisiana prior to the mass arrival of Acadians after the Great Upheaval of the mid-18th century, which resulted in the birth of the Cajun dialect. The prestige dialect still used by Creoles and Cajuns is often identified as deriving from Colonial French, but some linguists differentiate between the two, referring to the latter as Plantation Society French.\n\nHistorically spoken by Louisiana Creole population in lower French Louisiana, Colonial French is generally considered to have been adopted by whites, blacks and Cajuns. It is known among the educated that it has been incorrectly relabelled \"Cajun French\" by Cajuns and CODOFIL.\n\nFollowing the Great Upheaval in 1764, when many Acadians were exiled to French Louisiana, Louisiana French was adopted by the Acadians. Some scholars suggested that it survived as the prestige dialect spoken by Creoles, both white and of color, into the 21st century. There are populations of Creoles and Cajuns among other ethnic groups in the parishes of St. Martin, Avoyelles, Iberia, Pointe-Coupée, St. Charles, St. Landry, St. Mary, St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and other parishes south of Orleans, that still speak this prestige dialect.\n\nHowever, linguists have pointed out this prestige dialect is distinct from the pre-Upheaval Colonial French, and is largely derived from the standard French of the mid-19th century, Spanish, African languages, and Native Americans languages. As such, in 1998 linguist Michael Picone of the University of Alabama introduced the term \"Plantation Society French\" for the prestige dialect. There is a history of diglossia between Plantation Society French and Louisiana Creole French. Plantation Society French, at any rate, is quite close to the Standard French of the time of its origin, with some possible differences in pronunciation and vocabulary use.\n\nIt is still spoken by the Louisiana Indians, such as the Houmas, Avoyelles, Choctaw, and other tribal remnants, all present in pre-Acadian Louisiana and still present in contemporary Louisiana.\n\nAccording to the demographer Russel Thornton, North America contained approximately seven million native inhabitants in 1500. The population plummeted from the 16th century onward, primarily because of the new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which the Native Americans had no acquired immunity. At the end of the 17th century, there were likely no more than 100,000 to 200,000 Native Americans in Lower Louisiana. French colonists forced a small number of Native Americans into slavery, in spite of official prohibition. These slaves were persons who had been captured by rival tribes during raids and in battle, and sold to French colonists. At the time, many were sent to Saint Domingue in the West Indies for sale as slaves, or to Canada. In Louisiana, planters generally preferred using African slaves, though some had Native American servants.\n\nIn 1717, John Law, the French Comptroller General of Finances, decided to import African slaves into Louisiana. His objective was to develop the plantation economy of Lower Louisiana. The Royal Indies Company held a monopoly over the slave trade in the area. It imported approximately 6,000 slaves from Africa between 1719 and 1743. A small portion of these were sent to the Illinois Country to cultivate the fields or to work the lead mines. The economy of Lower Louisiana consequently became slave-dependent. As in other French colonies, the treatment of the slaves was regulated by the \"Code Noir\". The slaves often had a degree of autonomy beyond that suggested by the code. Initially, during public holidays, slaves were permitted to sell a portion of the crops they had cultivated. Some would hunt, cut wood or keep livestock far from the plantation. Lastly, although interracial marriages and regroupings of slaves were prohibited, planters often kept slave mistresses. The life and work of the slaves was difficult, with the intense harvest season and processing of sugar undoubtedly the hardest. The maintenance of canals for rice irrigation and travel also involved much labor.\n\nSlave residences and furnishings as supplied by planters were modest. The slaves were given simple straw pallets as beds. They typically had some trunks and kitchen utensils. The condition of the slaves depended on the treatment they received from their masters. When it was excessively cruel, the slaves often fled and hid in the marshes or in New Orleans. The Maroon societies that runaway slaves founded were often short-lived; Louisiana did not have the larger and semi-permanent Maroon villages that developed in the West Indies. Meanwhile, slave revolts were not as frequent in this area as they were in the Caribbean. The possibility of being set free was rather low; the slaves could not purchase their freedom. One of the first slaves to be freed was Louis Congo, who, in 1725, received freedom, land, and compensation in exchange for becoming the public executioner of New Orleans. Some freed slaves (notably women and former soldiers) formed small communities, which suffered from segregation; justice was more severe against them, and they did not have right to possess weapons. Slaves contributed to the creolization of Louisianan society. They brought okra from Africa, a plant common in the preparation of gumbo. While the Code Noir required that the slaves receive a Christian education, many secretly practiced animism and often combined elements of the two faiths.\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of Louisiana Creole today is the community whose members are a descendant of the \"native-born\" individuals of la Louisiane. Some individuals may not have each ethnic heritage, and some may have additional ancestries. It is estimated that 7,000 European immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th century—a hundredth the number of British colonists on the Atlantic coast. Initially, \"creole\" was the term used for Europeans (and sometimes, separately for Africans) born in Louisiana, in contrast to those who immigrated there.\n\nLouisiana attracted considerably fewer French colonists than did its West Indian colonies. After the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, which lasted several months, the colonists had several challenges ahead of them. Their living conditions were difficult: uprooted, they had to face a new, often hostile, environment. Many of these immigrants died during the maritime crossing or soon after their arrival. Physical conditions were harsh, and the tropical climate was difficult for colonists. Hurricanes, unknown in France, periodically struck the coast, destroying whole villages. The Mississippi River Delta was plagued with periodic floods and yellow fever epidemics, to which malaria and cholera were added as part of the Eurasian diseases that arrived with the Europeans. These conditions slowed colonization.\n\nMoreover, French villages and forts were not necessarily safe from enemy offensives. Attacks by Native Americans represented a real threat to the groups of isolated colonists; in 1729, their attacks killed 250 in Lower Louisiana. Forces of the Native American Natchez people took Fort Rosalie (now Natchez, Mississippi) by surprise, killing, among others, pregnant women. The French responded with warfare during the next two years: some Natchez were captured and deported as slaves to Saint Domingue; others left the area if they escaped.\n\nColonists were often young men, volunteers recruited in French ports or in Paris. Many served as indentured servants; they were required to remain in Louisiana for a length of time fixed by the contract of service to pay off their passage. During this time, they were \"temporary semi-slaves\". To increase the colonial population, the crown sent \"filles à la cassette\" (\"casket girls,\" referring to the small trunks they arrived with), young Frenchwomen, to marry the soldiers. They were given a dowry financed by the King. This practice built upon the 17th-century precedent when Louis XIV paid for transport and dowries for about 800 \"filles du roi\" (King's Daughters) to emigrate to New France to encourage marriage and formation of families in the colony.\n\nBy contrast, \"comfort women\" were described as those women \"of easy virtue\", vagrants or outlaws, and those without family, who arrived in Louisiana with a \"lettre de cachet\"; they were sent by force to the colony, especially during the Régence period early in the reign of Louis XV. Their stories inspired the novel \"Story of the Knight of Grieux and Manon Lescaut\", written by Abbé Prévost in 1731. In 1721, the ship \"La Baleine\" carried nearly 90 women of childbearing age to Louisiana; they were recruited from the Paris prison of La Salpetrière. Most quickly found husbands among the residents of the colony. These women, many of whom were most likely prostitutes or felons, were known as \"The Baleine Brides\".\n\nCommunities of Swiss and German peoples also settled in French Louisiana, but royal authorities always referred to the population as \"French\". After the Seven Years' War, in which Britain defeated France, the settlement attracted a variety of groups: Spanish settlers, refugees from Saint Domingue (particularly after 1791 when the slave uprisings began), opponents of the French Revolution, and Acadians. In 1785, 1633 people of Acadian origin were brought from France to New Orleans, 30 years after having been expelled from their homeland by the British. Other Acadians were transported there by the British after they were expelled from Acadia. About 4000 are thought to have settled in Louisiana, gradually forming the Cajun community.\n\nSocial mobility was easier in America than in France at the time. The seigneurial system was not imposed on the banks of the Mississippi, although the long lot land division scheme of the seigneurial system was adapted to some of the meandering rivers and bayous there. There were few corporations treated hierarchically and strictly regulated. Certain tradesmen managed to build fortunes rather quickly. The large planters of Louisiana were attached to the French way of life: they imported wigs and clothing fashionable in Paris. In the Country of Illinois, the wealthiest constructed stone-built houses and had several slaves. The largest traders mostly wound up settling in New Orleans.\n\nThe King sent the army in the event of conflict with the other colonial powers; in 1717, the colony of Mississippi counted 300 soldiers out of 550 people (Havard G, Vidal C, \"History of French America\", p. 225.). However, the colonial army, like that of France, suffered from desertions. Certain soldiers fled to become \"coureurs de bois\". There were few mutinies because repression was severe. The army held a fundamental place in the control of the territory. Soldiers built forts and frequently negotiated with the Native Americans.\n\nThe \"coureurs des bois\" (literally \"runners of the woods\") played an important part, though not well documented, in the expansion of French influence in North America. By the end of the 17th century, these adventurers had journeyed the length of the Mississippi River. They were motivated by the hope of finding gold or of carrying out a profitable fur trade with the Indians. The fur trade, often practiced without authorization, was a difficult activity, carried on most of the time by young unmarried men. Many ultimately wished to go on to more sedentary agricultural activities. Meanwhile, a good number of them were integrated into native communities, learned the languages, and took native wives. A well-known example is the French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau, husband to Sacagawea, who gave birth to Jean-Baptiste. They took part in the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804–1806.\n\nAncien Régime France wished to make Native Americans subjects of the king and good Christians, but the distance from Metropolitan France and the sparseness of French settlement prevented this. In official rhetoric, the Native Americans were regarded as subjects of the king of France, but in reality, they were largely autonomous due to their numerical superiority. The local authorities (governors, officers) did not have the means of imposing their decisions, and often compromised. The tribes offered essential support for the French in Louisiana: they ensured the survival of the colonists, participated with them in the fur trade, and were used as guides in expeditions. Their alliance was also essential in the fight against the British.\n\nThe two peoples influenced each other in many fields: the French learned the languages of the natives, who bought European goods (fabric, alcohol, firearms, etc.), and sometimes adopted their religion. The \"coureurs des bois\" and the soldiers borrowed canoes and moccasins. Many of them ate native food such as wild rice and various meats, like bear and dog. The colonists were often dependent on the Native Americans for food. Creole cuisine is the heir of these mutual influences: thus, \"sagamité\", for example, is a mix of corn pulp, bear fat and bacon. Today jambalaya, a word of Seminole origin, refers to a multitude of recipes calling for meat and rice, all very spicy. Sometimes shamans succeeded in curing the colonists thanks to traditional remedies (application of fir tree gum on wounds and Royal Fern on a rattlesnake bite).\n\nMany colonists both admired and feared the military power of the Native Americans, but others scorned their culture and regarded them as racially less pure than the Whites. In 1735, interracial marriages without the approval of the authorities were prohibited in Louisiana. The Jesuit priests were often scandalized by the supposedly libertine ways of the Native Americans. In spite of some disagreements (the Indians killed pigs, which devastated corn fields), and sometimes violent confrontations (Fox Wars, Natchez uprisings, and expeditions against the Chicachas), the relationship with the Native Americans was relatively good in Louisiana. French imperialism was expressed through some wars and the slavery of some Native Americans. But most of the time, the relationship was based on dialogue and negotiation.\n\nThis comparatively sparsely-settled northern area of French Louisiana was formerly the southern part of French Canada, and was transferred in 1717 by order of the King. It lies along the Mississippi and its tributaries, and was primarily devoted to grain and cereals agriculture. The French farmers lived in villages (such as near Fort de Chartres (the colonial administrative center), Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Sainte-Geneviève). They cultivated the land with paid and slave laborers, producing mostly corn and wheat. The fields were cleared with ploughs. They raised horses, cows and pigs, and also grew a little tobacco, hemp, flax and grapes (though most wine was still imported from France). Agriculture was seasonal and periodic flooding of the Mississippi took its toll on these communities.\n\nThe trading posts in the Illinois Country concentrated mostly on the fur trade. Placed at strategic points, they were modestly fortified. Only a few were made out of stone (e.g., Fort de Chartres). Like their American \"mountain man\" counterparts, the \"coureurs des bois\" exchanged beaverskin or deer pelts for weapons, cloth or shoddy goods, because the local economy was based on barter. The skins and fur are later sold in the forts and cities of New France. The Illinois Country also produced salt and lead, and provided New Orleans with game.\n\nLower Louisiana's plantation economy was based on slave labor. The owners generally had their main residence in New Orleans and entrusted the supervision of the fields to a treasurer.\n\nCrops were varied and adapted to the climate and terrain. Part of the production was intended for use by Louisianans (corn, vegetables, rice, livestock), the rest being exported to France (especially tobacco and indigo).\n\nNew Orleans was the economic capital of Louisiana, though it remained a village for several decades. The colonists built infrastructure to encourage trade; a canal was dug in 1723. The shops on the banks of the Mississippi also served as warehouses. The city exported pelts from the interior as well as agricultural products from the plantations. It was also, of course, a local hub of commerce.\n\nThe rare shipments from France brought food (lard, wheat...), alcohol, and various indispensable finished products (weapons, tools, cloth, and clothing). Exports remained relatively weak on the whole. New Orleans continued to sell wood, rice, and corn to the French West Indies.\n\nThe hostility between the French and British flared up again two years before the beginning of the Seven Years' War in Europe. In North America, the war became known as the French and Indian War. After some early victories from 1754 to 1757, thanks to help from their Native American allies, the French suffered several disastrous defeats in Canada from 1758 to 1760, culminating in the surrender of the capital city Quebec. With the loss of Canada, defense of Louisiana became impossible.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed on 10 February 1763, formalized the eviction of the French from North America. Canada and the east bank of the Mississippi were handed over to Great Britain (Province of Quebec (1763–91)). New Orleans and the west bank of the river had been secretly given to Spain the previous year. This decision provoked the departure of a few settlers; however, the Spaniards effectively took control of their new territories, which they named Luisiana, rather late (in 1766), and there was not much Spanish immigration. To the East, the United States foresaw the conquest of the West; commercial navigation on the Mississippi was opened to Americans in 1795.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, Louisiana was agitated under Spanish control: certain French-speaking colonists sent petitions to the metropolis and the slaves attempted revolts in 1791 and 1795.\n\nThe Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed in secrecy on October 1, 1800, envisaged the transfer of Western Louisiana as well as New Orleans to France in exchange for the Duchy of Parma. The transfer was confirmed by the Treaty of Aranjuez signed on March 21, 1801. However, Napoleon Bonaparte soon decided not to keep the immense territory. The army he sent to take possession of the colony was first required to put down a revolution in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti); its failure to do so, and the rupture of the Treaty of Amiens with the United Kingdom, prompted him to decide to sell Louisiana to the newly founded United States. This was done on April 30, 1803 for the sum of 80 million francs (15 million dollars). American sovereignty was established on December 20, 1803.\n\nFrench colonization in Louisiana left a cultural inheritance that has been celebrated significantly in recent decades. The heritage of the French language, Louisiana Creole French, and Cajun French has been most threatened; for this reason, the CODOFIL (Council for the Development of French in Louisiana) was created in 1968. A subject of debate is the variety of French that should be taught: that of France, Canadian French, standard Louisiana French, or Cajun French. Today, many Cajun-dominated areas of Louisiana have formed associations with Acadian communities in Canada, which send French professors to re-teach the language in the schools. In 2003, 7% of Louisianans were French-speaking, though most also spoke English. An estimated 25% of the state's population has some French ancestry, carrying a number of last names of French origin (e.g., LeBlanc, Cordier, Dauthier, Dion, Menard, Pineaux, Hébert, Ardoin, Roubideaux).\n\nMany cities and villages have names of French origin. They include St. Louis; Detroit; Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Lafayette; Mobile; Des Moines; St. Cloud, Minnesota; and Duluth, Minnesota (However, present day Duluth is located in what used to be the old Northwest Territory, not the former Louisiana Territory). The flag and the seal of the state of Minnesota carry a French legend. The Iowa state flag uses a variation of the French national flag as its base. Missouri state flag and flag of New Orleans colors are based on French flag. The flag of St. Louis has a fleur-de-lis prominently displayed. Historical festivals and commemorations point out the French presence: in 1999, Louisiana celebrated the 300th anniversary of its foundation; in 2001, Detroit did the same. In 2003, the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase was commemorated on numerous occasions as well as by a formal conference to recall its history. Certain places testify to a cultural inheritance left by the French; a prime example is the French Quarter of New Orleans. In 2015, St. Louis celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding by the French in 1764. Many French forts have been rebuilt and opened to visitors.\n\nA key part of Louisianan culture finds its roots in the French period: Creole songs influenced the blues and jazz. Cajun music, often sung in French, remains very much alive today. New Orleans' Carnival season, with its height on Mardi Gras Day, testifies to a long-lived Roman Catholic heritage.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has released 15 albums and has played roles in seven films.\n\nAlain Souchon was born in Casablanca, Morocco. His family on his mother's side is Swiss, and he has dual French-Swiss nationality. Six months after he was born, his family moved to France. When he was 15 his father died in an accident. His mother sent him to a French college in England, but due to problems registering he decided to stay in London and work. Upon returning to France he took up guitar, influenced by English and American music. In 1970, he married and had his first son continuing to play in the cabarets and bars in the Rive Gauche of Paris.\n\nSouchon signed his first contract in 1971 with the Pathe-Marconi label but had no success. Bob Socquet, the artistic director of RCA encouraged him to perform his song \"L'amour 1830\" at the Rose D'Or of Antibes contest. Souchon then began to collaborate with composer/arranger Laurent Voulzy (b. 1948); they would write together, but each released albums under his own name. Souchon's first hit was \"J'ai 10 ans\" (1974), from the album of the same name. \n\nHe continued releasing albums and in 1978 wrote the theme for François Truffaut's 1979 film \"Love on the Run\" (\"L'amour en fuite\"). At this time his second son was born. In 1980, he was invited to perform at l'Olympia. He also began his acting career, most notably starring in the 1983 film \"L'été Meurtrier\". Following the album 'On avance', he left RCA and signed with Virgin Records at 40 years old. In 1989 \"La beauté de Ava Gardner\" was voted best title of the year by the Victoires de la Musique.\n\nThen came Souchon's biggest hit \"Foule sentimentale\" from 1993's million-selling \"C'est déjà ça\". At the 20th anniversary of the Victoires de la Musique in 1995, Alain Souchon received the award for best \"Chanson Originale\" for his song \"Foule Sentimentale.\" In 1996, he received the \"le Prix Vincent Scotto\" award given by the SACEM (Societe des Auteurs Compositeurs) for his song \"Sous les Jupes des Filles\". Souchon returned in 2005 with the hugely successful album \"La vie Théodore\" which contained the hit single \"...Et si en plus y'a personne\".\n\n\nVictoires de la musique\n\nGlobes de Cristal Award\n\n"}

There are four types: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections (see below under classification of Euclidean plane isometries).\n\nThe set of Euclidean plane isometries forms a group under composition: the Euclidean group in two dimensions. It is generated by reflections in lines, and every element of the Euclidean group is the composite of at most three distinct reflections.\n\nInformally, a Euclidean plane isometry is any way of transforming the plane without \"deforming\" it. For example, suppose that the Euclidean plane is represented by a sheet of transparent plastic sitting on a desk. Examples of isometries include:\n\nThese are examples of translations, rotations, and reflections respectively. There is one further type of isometry, called a glide reflection (see below under classification of Euclidean plane isometries).\n\nHowever, folding, cutting, or melting the sheet are not considered isometries. Neither are less drastic alterations like bending, stretching, or twisting.\n\nAn isometry of the Euclidean plane is a distance-preserving transformation of the plane. That is, it is a map\nsuch that for any points \"p\" and \"q\" in the plane,\nwhere \"d\"(\"p\", \"q\") is the usual Euclidean distance between \"p\" and \"q\".\n\nIt can be shown that there are four types of Euclidean plane isometries. (Note: the notations for the types of isometries listed below are not completely standardised.)\nReflections, or mirror isometries, denoted by \"F\", where \"c\" is a point in the plane and \"v\" is a unit vector in R. (\"F\" is for \"flip\".) have the effect of reflecting the point \"p\" in the line \"L\" that is perpendicular to \"v\" and that passes through \"c\". The line \"L\" is called the reflection axis or the associated mirror. To find a formula for \"F\", we first use the dot product to find the component \"t\" of \"p\" − \"c\" in the \"v\" direction,\n\nThe combination of rotations about the origin and reflections about a line through the origin is obtained with all orthogonal matrices (i.e. with determinant 1 and −1) forming orthogonal group \"O\"(2). In the case of a determinant of −1 we have:\nwhich is a reflection in the \"x\"-axis followed by a rotation by an angle θ, or equivalently, a reflection in a line making an angle of θ/2 with the \"x\"-axis. Reflection in a parallel line corresponds to adding a vector perpendicular to it.\n\nTranslations, denoted by \"T\", where \"v\" is a vector in R have the effect of shifting the plane in the direction of \"v\". That is, for any point \"p\" in the plane,\n\nA translation can be seen as a composite of two parallel reflections.\n\nRotations, denoted by \"R\", where \"c\" is a point in the plane (the centre of rotation), and θ is the angle of rotation. In terms of coordinates, rotations are most easily expressed by breaking them up into two operations. First, a rotation around the origin is given by\n\nThe set of translations and rotations together form the rigid motions or displacements. This set forms a group under composition, the \"group of rigid motions\", a subgroup of the full group of Euclidean isometries.\n\nA rotation can be seen as a composite of two non-parallel reflections.\n\nGlide reflections, denoted by \"G\", where \"c\" is a point in the plane, \"v\" is a unit vector in R, and \"w\" is non-null a vector perpendicular to \"v\" are a combination of a reflection in the line described by \"c\" and \"v\", followed by a translation along \"w\". That is,\n\nThe identity isometry, defined by \"I\"(\"p\") = \"p\" for all points \"p\" is a special case of a translation, and also a special case of a rotation. It is the only isometry which belongs to more than one of the types described above.\n\nIn all cases we multiply the position vector by an orthogonal matrix and add a vector; if the determinant is 1 we have a rotation, a translation, or the identity, and if it is −1 we have a glide reflection or a reflection.\n\nA \"random\" isometry, like taking a sheet of paper from a table and randomly laying it back, \"almost surely\" is a rotation or a glide reflection (they have three degrees of freedom). This applies regardless of the details of the probability distribution, as long as θ and the direction of the added vector are independent and uniformly distributed and the length of the added vector has a continuous distribution. A pure translation and a pure reflection are special cases with only two degrees of freedom, while the identity is even more special, with no degrees of freedom.\n\nReflections, or mirror isometries, can be combined to produce any isometry. Thus isometries are an example of a reflection group.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, we have the following possibilities.\n\nAdding more mirrors does not add more possibilities (in the plane), because they can always be rearranged to cause cancellation.\n\nWe can recognize which of these isometries we have according to whether it preserves hands or swaps them, and whether it has at least one fixed point or not, as shown in the following table (omitting the identity).\n\nIsometries requiring an odd number of mirrors — reflection and glide reflection — always reverse left and right. The even isometries — identity, rotation, and translation — never do; they correspond to \"rigid motions\", and form a normal subgroup of the full Euclidean group of isometries. Neither the full group nor the even subgroup are abelian; for example, reversing the order of composition of two parallel mirrors reverses the direction of the translation they produce.\n\nSince the even subgroup is normal, it is the kernel of a homomorphism to a quotient group, where the quotient is isomorphic to a group consisting of a reflection and the identity. However the full group is not a direct product, but only a semidirect product, of the even subgroup and the quotient group.\n\nComposition of isometries mixes kinds in assorted ways. We can think of the identity as either two mirrors or none; either way, it has no effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. It is often said that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and Euler proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.\n\nWe thus have two new kinds of isometry subgroups: all translations, and rotations sharing a fixed point. Both are subgroups of the even subgroup, within which translations are normal. Because translations are a normal subgroup, we can factor them out leaving the subgroup of isometries with a fixed point, the orthogonal group.\n\nThe subgroup structure suggests another way to compose an arbitrary isometry:\n\nThis works because translations are a normal subgroup of the full group of isometries, with quotient the orthogonal group; and rotations about a fixed point are a normal subgroup of the orthogonal group, with quotient a single reflection.\n\nThe subgroups discussed so far are not only infinite, they are also continuous (Lie groups). Any subgroup containing at least one non-zero translation must be infinite, but subgroups of the orthogonal group can be finite. For example, the symmetries of a regular pentagon consist of rotations by integer multiples of 72° (360° / 5), along with reflections in the five mirrors which perpendicularly bisect the edges. This is a group, D, with 10 elements. It has a subgroup, C, of half the size, omitting the reflections. These two groups are members of two families, D and C, for any \"n\" > 1. Together, these families constitute the rosette groups.\n\nTranslations do not fold back on themselves, but we can take integer multiples of any finite translation, or sums of multiples of two such independent translations, as a subgroup. These generate the lattice of a periodic tiling of the plane.\n\nWe can also combine these two kinds of discrete groups — the discrete rotations and reflections around a fixed point and the discrete translations — to generate the frieze groups and wallpaper groups. Curiously, only a few of the fixed-point groups are found to be compatible with discrete translations. In fact, lattice compatibility imposes such a severe restriction that, up to isomorphism, we have only 7 distinct frieze groups and 17 distinct wallpaper groups. For example, the pentagon symmetries, D, are incompatible with a discrete lattice of translations. (Each higher dimension also has only a finite number of such crystallographic groups, but the number grows rapidly; for example, 3D has 230 groups and 4D has 4783.)\n\nIn terms of complex numbers, the isometries of the plane are either of the form\nor of the form\nfor some complex numbers \"a\" and ω with |ω| = 1. This is easy to prove: if \"a\" = \"f\"(0) and ω = \"f\"(1) − \"f\"(0) and if one defines\nthen \"g\" is an isometry, \"g\"(0) = 0, and \"g\"(1) = 1. It is then easy to see that \"g\" is either the identity or the conjugation, and the statement being proved follows from this and from the fact that \"f\"(\"z\") = \"a\" + ω\"g\"(\"z\").\n\nThis is obviously related to the previous classification of plane isometries, since:\n\nNote that a rotation about complex point \"p\" is obtained by complex arithmetic with\nwhere the last expression shows the mapping equivalent to rotation at 0 and a translation.\nTherefore, given direct isometry formula_20 one can solve\nformula_21 to obtain formula_22 as the center for an equivalent rotation, provided that formula_23, that is, provided the direct isometry is not a pure translation. As stated by Cederberg, \"A direct isometry is either a rotation or a translation.\"\n\n\n"}

Little survives of the structures erected by the monks apart from the Priory Church, which is a grade I listed building in the care of English Heritage.\n\nIt was founded by William Bertram, Baron of Mitford, in the reign of Henry I as an Augustinian priory. The exact date is not known but cannot have been later than 1135, as Henry died that year. About 1180 or so, Brinkburn became an independent house, and the building of the monastic church was commenced. The architectural style has been described as \"transitional\" (i.e. between Norman and Gothic).\n\nAlthough the Priory acquired lands in Northumberland and Durham over the years it was never particularly wealthy. Little is known of the early history of the priory, although it is known that it survived some difficult times. In fact, as late as 1419 it was raided and robbed.\n\nBrinkburn Priory was dissolved in 1536 after Parliament enacted the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act. The \"lesser monasteries\" were those with an income of less than £200 per annum, and Brinkburn fell into this category as in 1535 the priory's value had been recorded as £69 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus. After the dissolution the estate was mainly owned by the Fenwick family and in the late 16th century they built a manor house on the ruins of the Priory buildings and adjacent to the Priory Church.\n\nServices continued to be held at Brinkburn and the church was retained in a fair state of repair till the end of the 16th century. In 1602 it was reported to be in a state of decay, and at some point before 1700 the roof had collapsed and regular services were abandoned.\n\nIn the 1750s Thomas Sharp, Archdeacon of Northumberland, tried to effect repairs to the ruin. Although there was considerable support for the project, work was called off after a dispute between the owner William Fenwick and the Vicar of Felton.\n\nIn the 19th century the Cadogan family, owners of Brinkburn, revived the plans for the restoration of the church and work began in 1858. The roof was completed in the space of a year, and the stained glass windows had been inserted by 1864. The church, however, was not furnished until 1868. Brinkburn Priory today is a sympathetic 19th-century restoration of the mediæval original.\n\nThe tombstone of Prior William, Bishop of Durham (died 1484) was found during the reconstruction, as was the original altar stone with five crosses. The latter is still preserved along with an ancient font.\n\nReligious services are still occasionally held here. It is also a venue for concerts, notably the Brinkburn Festival which is directed by Paul McCreesh. However, Brinkburn Priory today is usually a peaceful and tranquil place.\n\nThe manor house, which utilises part of the vaulted undercroft to the monks' dining hall, presents a nineteenth-century appearance. It is a grade II* listed building.\n\nBrinkburn Mill, once part of the Priory precinct, was rebuilt in the nineteenth century. It was refurbished in 1990 by the Landmark Trust.\n\nThe locally renowned \"Brinkburn\" on Brinkburn Road, Darlington is also part of the original estate.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a co-founder of the George C. Marshall Institute in 1984.\nNierenberg was born on February 13, 1919, at 213 E. 13th Street, on the Lower East Side of New York, the son of very poor Jewish immigrants from Austro-Hungary. He went to Townsend Harris High School and then the City College of New York (CCNY), where he won a scholarship to spend his junior year abroad in France at the University of Paris. In 1939 he participated in research at Columbia University, where he took a course in statistical mechanics from his future mentor, I. I. Rabi. He went on to graduate work at Columbia, but from 1941 spent the war years seconded to the Manhattan Project, working on isotope separation, before returning to Columbia to complete his PhD.\n\nIn 1948 Nierenberg took up his first academic staff position, as Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Michigan. From 1950 to 1965 he was Associate and then Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he had a very large and productive low energy nuclear physics laboratory, graduating 40 PhD’s during this time and publishing about 100 papers. He was responsible for the determination of more nuclear moments than any other single individual. This work was cited when he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971.\n\nDuring this period, in 1953, Nierenberg took a one-year leave to serve as the director of the Columbia University Hudson Laboratories, working on naval warfare problems. Later, he oversaw the design and construction of the “new” physics building at Berkeley. Much later (1960–1962) he took leave once again as Assistant Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in charge of scientific affairs, where he oversaw many international studies on physics and advanced defense technologies.\n\nIn 1965 Nierenberg was asked to be director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). Nierenberg was director of SIO for 21 years, the longest serving director to date. During his tenure, five modern research vessels joined the Scripps fleet and the institution’s budget increased fivefold. He oversaw the Deep Sea Drilling Project (1966–1986), which produced scientific advances such as the discovery of deep-sea hydrocarbons, the finding that the Mediterranean Sea had once been a closed basin and even a dry seabed, and confirmation that present ocean basins are young. The project became the first multi-institutional, international collaboration in science and a model for later projects.\n\nNierenberg gained national recognition for his contributions to science. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971 and to the governing Council of the Academy in 1979. He was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965 and the National Academy of Engineering in 1983. In 1981, Nierenberg became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. In 1987 he was awarded the Delmer S. Fahrney Medal from the Franklin Institute for outstanding leadership in science.\n\nNierenberg served on a large number of panels and advisory committees, primarily after he returned from NATO. In 1971 he was appointed chairman of the National Academy of Sciences National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere and served on this committee until 1977. He served on various panels of the President's Science Advisory Committee. He was a member of the National Science Board from 1972 to 1978 and was appointed for another term from November 1982 to May 1988.\n\nNierenberg was a consultant to the National Security Agency, and served on many military-related panels. In 1976 he was appointed one of two senior consultants to the newly formed White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). He was a member of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Advisory Council from 1978 to 1982 and served as its first chairman. He was Chairman of the OSTP Acid Rain Peer Review Panel, whose report \"Acid Rain\" was published in 1984. The report encouraged the administration to curb acid rain emissions.\n\nNierenberg took a strong interest in the problem of global warming. Under his predecessor at Scripps, Roger Revelle, Scripps had begun a program of monitoring and other greenhouse gases. Nierenberg supported this work and intervened personally when research funds for the program were threatened.\n\nIn October 1980, during the Carter presidency, an Act of Congress was passed requesting the National Academy of Science to review what was known about climate change. Nierenberg was appointed by the Academy to chair the committee to produce this report. The committee was made up of prominent physical scientists and two economists, William Nordhaus of Yale and Thomas Schelling of Harvard. Schelling and many of the scientists had served on committees for two previous reports for the Carter administration, which had highlighted global warming as a potentially major problem, and Nordhaus was developing a new model for growth in emissions, the first which did not assume linear extrapolations.\n\nThe scientific facts of the resulting \"Changing Climate\" report were largely in line with the previous reports. Its key points were:\n\nThe report also contained policy recommendations:\n\nThe policy recommendations have proved controversial. Oreskes and Conway contend that the chapters written by the economists differ from those written by the scientists, that the policy recommendations reflect mainly the views of the economists, and that Nierenberg, the committee chairman, personally rejected an emerging consensus\nview on global warming among climate scientists, and \"in doing so arguably launched the climate change debate, transforming the issue from one of scientific concern to one of political controversy.\" In a 2010 paper, Nierenberg's son Nicolas disputes each of these points, arguing that the scientific conclusions of the report reflected the current consensus and pointing out that other climate reports from the time also stopped short of recommending near-term energy-policy changes.\n\nNierenberg subsequently became a co-founder of the George C. Marshall Institute, and a critic of some of the scientific conclusions of various research papers.\n\nA building on the campus of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography is named for him and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest has been started. Some recipients have been E. O. Wilson, Walter Cronkite, Jane Lubchenco, David Attenborough, Jane Goodall, Craig Venter, Gordon Moore, James E. Hansen and Richard Dawkins.\n\n\n\n"}

A given position (for example, the occupation of \"priest\") may belong to many individuals. Social position influences social status. Social position can help to identify a person's position within the social hierarchy in a society.\n\nStanley Wasserman and Katherine Faust Stanley cautioned that \"there is considerable disagreement among social scientists among social scientists about the definitions of the related concepts of social position, social status, and social role.\" They note that while many scholars differentiate those terms, they can define those terms in a way that clashes with the definitions of another scholar; for example they state that \"[Ralph] Linton uses the term 'status' in a way that is identical to our use of the term \"position\".\n\nSocial positions an individual may hold fall into the categories of occupation (medical doctor, academic lecturer), profession (member of associations and organisations), family (parent, sibling, etc.), hobby (member of various clubs and organisations), among others. An individual is likely to create a personal hierarchy of such positions, where one will be a central position while the rest are peripheral positions.\n\nSocial positions are \"visible\" if they require an individual to wear a uniform or some other kind of identifying mark. Often individual clothes or other attributes will advertise what social position one has at the moment. Non-visible social positions are called \"hidden\". A position that is deemed the most important to a given individual is called \"central\", others are \"peripheral\". If a \"sequence of positions\" is required to obtain a given position, it can be defined as a career, and a change of position in this context is a promotion or demotion. Some social positions may make it easier for a given person to obtain others; in other cases, some positions may be restricted to individuals meeting specific criteria.\n\nSocial position together with social role determines an individual's place in the social environment and social organisation. A group of social positions will create a social class and a social circle.\n\nA social conflict caused by interference between social positions is called a \"position conflict\".\n\nSubjective social position refers to an individual's perceived social position in a social hierarchy. According to Kristina Lindemann the individual objective characteristics like education, occupation and income are related with the subjective social position. In addition, the culture and society that a person lives and grows in, heavily impacts an individual's subjective social position. \"An individual's subjective social position status depends not only on the objective characteristics but also on how people experience society, the way they perceive their position in comparison with others,and what they imagine their position would be in the future.\" Lindemann divides objective characteristics into two groups, ascribed and achieved characteristics. Ascribed characteristics are things like age, gender, and ethnicity. Achieved characteristics are things like the education level, occupation, or income. Studies have indicated a significant relevance of these characteristics to an individual's subjective social position.\n\nOn the other hand, some theories expect that objective characteristics do not have influence on subjective social position. The reference group theory mentioned by Lindemann in her essay states that people see the world as an enlarged version of their reference group. People base their social position upon the people around them. Typically people's family, friends, and co-workers are usually very similar, and in general, most people see themselves as average and unexceptional. The status maximizing process also mentioned by Lindemann means that subjective social position reflects also person prospects and hopes for future societal attainment.\n\nLindemann's empirical study focuses on Estonian society. Age is considered an impactful characteristic on people when identifying with their social position in Estonia. Young people give higher estimation to their social position, which is a tendency also found in other Eastern European countries. Gender and ethnicity, are also considerable characteristics in identifying social position. In general, the subjective social position of men and women is not significantly different in western countries. Ethnicity impacts social position differently from country to country. More importantly the influence of ethnicity is closely related to the extent ethnic minorities are accepted by the overall society.\n\nDifferent studies have shown that the effect of income on class identification in particular has increased during the last decades in Western countries. In Estonia, the income is the most important determinant that shapes people opinion of their social position. The increased influence of income on the subjective social position can be explained by the rise of consumer society values. In her studies Lindemann also found that occupation and education influence significantly the subjective social position. As expected, managers and professionals and higher educated people identify with the middle or higher strata, while unskilled workers and low educated people relate with the lower positions in social hierarchy.\n\nIn several studies, researchers have assessed Individuals' perceived social position using the single-item MacArthur scale of subjective social status. The MacArthur scale of subjective social status is a drawing of a ten-rung ladder presented as the distribution of individuals in a social hierarchy. People with the highest salaries, best ranked jobs and highest education levels are depicted as standing on the upper rungs of the ladder, whereas those with the lowest salaries, poorest jobs, and lowest education levels are those who stand at the bottom of the ladder.\n\nA social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes.\n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one's relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one's current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time.\n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.\n\nThe term \"class\" is etymologically derived from the Latin \"classis\", which was used by census takers to categorize citizens by wealth, in order to determine military service obligations.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the term \"class\" began to replace classifications such as estates, rank, and orders as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and income as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.\n\nOne way to change one's social position is to increase human capital. The human capital theory suggest that people having more job-relevant resources, such as education and training, should receive more organizational rewards i.e. promotions than people with fewer of these resources. Human capital alone can affect social position to a certain extent. An individual has to have social skills and build social networks to help promote their social position.\n\nAnother way to effectively increase one's chance of obtaining or sustaining social position is by increasing social capital. The social capital theory posits that certain qualities in workplace relationships are beneficial for receiving organizational rewards, and employees whose relationships are not characterized by these qualities are at a disadvantage. In other words, people who have social relationships with upper management might get to know about a promotion possibility before someone lacking in the social capital infrastructure that relays that sort of information.\n\nErika James finds through studies and analysis that in general blacks have been promoted at a slower pace than whites. This workplace discrimination occurred most likely because of unequal human/social capital between the two races. Clearly this is not a justification for the actions to occur. The issue of race still exists as a statistically proven factor in American job markets.\n\nFor an individual to hold a social position thoroughly and knowledgeably they must be trusted in the market and reflect it in their behavior. Paul S. Adler says that a review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust. He believes the form of trust that is most effective in this context is of a distinctively modern kind - \"reflective trust\" - as opposed to traditionalistic, \"blind\" trust.\n\nThe values at work in modern trust are those of the scientific community: \"universalism, communism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism\" (Merton 1973, p. 270). Modern trust is inclusive and open. The author concludes that the efficacy of trust for knowledge management and the likelihood of its growth over time are maximized if:\n\n\nThere is an element of trust necessary within society and for identifying with a particular social position - especially relevant to particular community positions where one's actions weigh heavily on one's social position.\n\n"}

With the Steelers, he won Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks. He played college football at Kansas State University.\n\nMorgan attended South Garland High School in Garland, Texas. In football, he was a three-year letterman. As a junior, he was named All-State by \"The Dallas Morning News\". As a senior, he received Team's Most Valuable Player, All-Area, All-Conference, All-State and prep All-American honors.\n\nMorgan enrolled at Kansas City Kansas Community College during the spring of 1998, where he ran track. He transferred to Blinn Community College at the end of the year. As a freshman, he helped the team win the Junior College National Championship. As a sophomore, he had 38 receptions for 645 yards, 9 touchdowns and was considered one of the top wide receivers in Junior College. He transferred to Kansas State University after the season.\n\nAs a junior, he posted 42 receptions for 1,007 yards, a 24-yard average (school record) and 9 touchdowns. As a senior, he registered 64 receptions (fifth in school history) for 1,166 yards (school record), an 18.2-yard average and 14 touchdowns (school record).\n\nMorgan finished his college career with 106 receptions (sixth in school history), 2,173 yards (third in school history), a 20.5-yard average (school record) and 23 touchdowns (second in school history). He became one of only seven KSU players to catch more than one hundred passes, one of only four players with more than 2,000 receiving yards, second with eight 100-yard games. He was also the only Wildcat to notch 1,000 receiving yards in two consecutive seasons.\n\nMorgan was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he passed Dennis Northcutt on the depth chart and started 9 games. He made 10 receptions for 432 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2002, he had his best season as a professional, recording 56 receptions for 964 yards, a 17.2-yard average (led the NFL) and 7 touchdowns, while helping the team make the playoffs. In the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had 9 receptions for 151 yards and 2 touchdowns, but his effort was lost after linebacker Dwayne Rudd committed what is known in Browns lore as “Helmetgate”, after taking off his helmet to celebrate with less than 10 seconds left on the clock and the Browns clinging to a 39–37 lead, which drew a critical unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. His most memorable catch was a Hail Mary touchdown reception with no time left against the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 8, sealing a 21–20 win.\n\nIn 2003, he started 15 games, collecting 38 receptions for 516 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2004, he started 5 games, collecting 9 receptions for 144 yards and 3 touchdowns. On October 19, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for wide receiver Antonio Bryant, following a public dispute between Bryant and Cowboys head coach Bill Parcells.\n\nIn 2004, Morgan would have a rather mediocre season with the Cowboys in 2004, despite his rapid elevation on the depth chart following an injury to Terry Glenn, finishing with 22 receptions for 260 yards. In 2005, Morgan performed poorly in an unexpected depth chart battle against second-year player Patrick Crayton and Parcells began to perceive him as uncompetitive, dropping him to fourth on the depth chart. He was released in order for the Cowboys to pick up wide receiver Peerless Price off waivers on September 5.\n\nOn September 6, 2005, he was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers, reuniting former Browns offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. He was mostly used to return kickoffs, ranking fifth in the AFC with 23 returns for 583 yards and a 25.3-yard average. He also had 9 receptions for 150 yards and 2 touchdowns.

{"id": "1989714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989714", "title": "Welcome to the Machine", "text": "Welcome to the Machine\n\n\"Welcome to the Machine\" is the second song on Pink Floyd's 1975 album \"Wish You Were Here\". It features heavily processed synthesizers and acoustic guitars, as well as a wide range of tape effects. Both the music and the lyrics were written by bassist Roger Waters.\n\nThe track was built upon a basic throbbing sound made by an EMS VCS 3 followed by a one-repeat echo which Waters would have played originally on bass guitar (which he overdubs an actual bass part to the song which is more predominant on the Stereo Quad mix). On the original LP, the song segued from the first 5 parts of the suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and closed the first side. On the CD pressings, especially the 1997 and 2000 remastered issues, it segues (although very faintly) to \"Have a Cigar\". This segueing is a few seconds longer on the US version than the UK version. David Gilmour admitted that he had trouble singing one line of the song, saying, \"It was a line I just couldn't reach, so we dropped the tape down half a semitone.\" He sang the part at a slightly lower pitch, then the tape speed was raised back to normal.\n\nLike many Pink Floyd songs, \"Welcome to the Machine\" features some variations in its meter and time signatures. Each bass \"throb\" of the VCS synthesizer is notated as a quarter note in the sheet music, and each note switches from one side of the stereo spread to the next (this effect is particularly prominent when listened to on headphones). Although the introduction of the song (when the acoustic guitar enters) does not actually change time signatures, it does sustain each chord for three measures, rather than two or four, resulting in a nine-bar intro where an even number of bars might be expected.\nThe verses and choruses are largely in 4/4, or \"common time\". However, on the line \"\"It's all right, we know where you've been\"\", a measure of 7/4 is inserted, shortening the sequence, and causing the left-right stereo panning to be reversed for quite some time. An instrumental section begins, with the acoustic guitar adding variations in its strum pattern, until it switches to 3/4 for a length of time, when a 12-string acoustic riff is introduced, ascending up the E minor scale until the chord changes to C major seventh. Finally, the instrumental section ends, and the second verse begins. With the lyric, \"\"It's all right, we told you what to dream\"\", once again a measure of 7/4 is inserted, and the stereo panning is finally returned to normal. Incidentally, these two phrases beginning with \"It's all right ...\" are the only parts to feature any chord other than some form of E minor or C major—these phrases go to an A bass in the first verse, and in the second verse, the acoustic guitar articulates the A as a major chord, with its C# in contradiction of the frequent C chords. The song remains in 4/4 from this point forward.\n\nGerald Scarfe created a music video, initially a backdrop film for when the band played the track on its 1977 In the Flesh tour. The fanciful video begins with what appears to be a giant mechanical Axolotl. The creature slowly lumbers across an apocalyptic cityscape. The scene then shifts to show emaciated rats leaping around corpse-laden steel girders. Gleaming industrial smokestacks soon fade in, and disturbingly crack and ooze blood. A view of a barren desert is then immediately shown. In the background a small tower grows out of this desert, but then transforms into a screaming monster, which stops to pant for a few seconds before viciously decapitating an unsuspecting man in the foreground. His head then very slowly decays to a damaged skull as the sun sets. Finally, an ocean of blood washes away this scene, and the waves turn into thousands of hands waving in rhythm to the music (much like people at a rock concert). All of the surrounding buildings are swept away; except one. Despite being pulled at by the bloody masses, it survives and, synchronising with the sound effects at the end of the track, flies up and away, high above the clouds to where it fits snugly into a hole inside a gargantuan floating ovoid structure.\n\nMusic and lyrics by Roger Waters.\n\n\nThe song was performed for the first time on Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour. Gilmour and Waters shared lead vocals, although in initial performances, Gilmour sang on his own with some backing vocals by Waters. Also for the 1977 live performances, David Gilmour played his acoustic guitar parts on his Black Strat, Waters played an Ovation acoustic guitar, Snowy White played bass guitar, Nick Mason played his tympani parts on his drum kit with mallets, and Rick Wright handled the Mini-Moog synths and VCS3 while Dick Parry played the string synths off-stage. The live renditions of the song were complex because music had to be synchronised with the backdrop film and its sound effects. As a result, the band had to wear headphones and listen to a click-track which, in turn, meant that there was very little room left for improvisation.\n\nPink Floyd would play the song again on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour (1987-89) where Tim Renwick played lead guitar, while Gilmour played a 12-string acoustic guitar. These renditions were not synchronised to the film.\n\nThe song was performed by Roger Waters during his 1984-85 Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking Tour, on the 1987 Radio K.A.O.S. Tour, with Mel Collins as saxophone soloist. All of these performances were perfectly synchronised to the film. These live versions deviated significantly from the album version. It was also played on the 1999–2002 In the Flesh tour (only stills from the animation were used) and appears on the \"In the Flesh\" concert DVD and CD. Waters also performed the song on his Us + Them Tour (2017-18), in a version which resembles the album version, in which the music is yet again synchronised perfectly with the screen video.\n\nThe Pink Floyd tribute band the Machine are named after this song, and they often use it as their opening number. Tim Footman used the song title for his book, \"Welcome to the Machine: OK Computer and the Death of the Classic Album\" (2007, ). Footman writes about how the Radiohead album \"OK Computer\" shares many musical and thematic elements with Pink Floyd's mid-70s oeuvre, although members of Radiohead have resisted the comparison.\n\nQuotes by David Gilmour, taken from the \"Wish You Were Here\" songbook.\n"}

After viewing some fireworks and a few balloons being thrown up in the air, Tiki falls asleep.\n\nElsewhere, four mice- Apollo (the leader), Brutus (the muscle), Watt (the gentleman) and Pete (the gut) -find that the provisions that had been set aside in the attic for a party have been absconded with. Naturally upset, everyone begins pointing fingers; thankfully, Apollo finds a more likely cause of the theft, as he spies a sneaky rat crawling around up in the attic. Knowing that rats travel in packs, Apollo rallies his fellow mice and begins the hunt for the whole rat pack. Finding the rats one by one (and knocking a few senseless for good measure), the gang eventually find the commanding officer behind the whole rat invasion hiding in the garage and- following an intense battle between the mice gang and rats -knock him out. Despite the victory, the mice still have no clue who these rats are or what they're up to; however, they are quickly stunned out of their wondering as Bonnie- the local high-society city mouse -comes in, worrying about her brother, Tiki, as he has gone missing. Thinking he's lost in the Back Alley, she joins Apollo's squad and rushes off, allowing the rat officer from earlier (who faked his fainting) to run away.\n\nThe game received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

He was the ninth child born to Christoffel Yates, a prosperous farmer and blacksmith, and Catelyntje Winne. His siblings included Joseph Yates, a merchant, and John G. Yates, a blacksmith.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Joseph Yates and Albany native Huybertie (née Marselis) Yates. His nephew, Robert Yates, who represented New York at the Philadelphia Convention. Another nephew was Continental Congressman Peter Waldron Yates.\n\nAfter completing preparatory school, Yates was apprenticed to a shoemaker, which later led his political foes to call him a \"crude cobbler\" and Philip Schuyler to deride him as the \"late cobbler of laws and old shoes.\" An ambitious man, he went on to become a surveyor, investing in land, and then studied law with Peter Silvester, setting up a successful law practice. Eventually, Yates was appointed the Sheriff of Albany, serving from 1754 until 1759 under the agency of Robert Livingston Jr.\n\nFrom 1754 until 1773, he was elected and served on the Albany City Council where he was closely associated with the populist George Clinton (who eventually became the Vice President of the United States). Yates' election was notable as the Council was generally made up of wealthy merchants and he was the sole lawyer among the group, and was known for his attacks against the patrician landowners of the era and support for small farmers. He was also known to be a forceful opponent of British oppression.\n\nFrom 1774 to 1776, he was the chairman of the Albany Committee of Correspondence. Yates was also a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777, serving as president pro tempore on November 2, 1775, August 10, 1776, and was its chairman in 1776 and 1777.\n\nYates was a delegate for New York to the Congress of the Confederation in 1787 and 1788, and won a reputation as a \"churlish delegate who often cast the only 'nay'\" vote. He was also a member of the Council of Appointment in 1777-78 and again in 1784.\n\nCommencing on September 9, 1777, Yates was a member of the 1st New York State Legislature, having been elected to represent one of six seats for the Western District, which consisted of Albany and Tryon counties. He was re-elected several times and served thirteen consecutive sessions in the Senate until he declined re-election following his refusal to sign an oath to the U.S. Constitution. He was succeeded by Stephen Van Rensselaer. By the end of his time in the Senate, the Western District consisted of Albany, Columbia and Montgomery counties.\n\nYates, along with his fellow Anti-Federalist nephew Robert, with whom he shared the pen-name the \"Rough Hewer\", was a prolific pamphleteer. He was known for his strong Anti-Federalist writings around the encroachment of Federal powers over New York state affairs and his opposition to the ratification of the Constitution. Both Yates were prominent opponents of the nationalist Federalist Alexander Hamilton.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the State Senate, Yates old friend and the then New York Governor George Clinton appointed him as the mayor of Albany in 1790, a role he served in until his death in 1796. As mayor, Yates opposed and was a vocal critic of the Federalist John Jay (who succeeded Clinton as Governor and appointed Stephen Van Rensselaer as his Lt. Governor) following the Jay Treaty, which was a 1795 treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain which purportedly averted war between the countries and resolved issues remaining since the Treaty of Paris of 1783 (which ended the American Revolutionary War). The opposition led to the formation of the anti-Treaty Democratic Republican party in New York. During his term, oil street lamps were installed in Albany.\n\nYates was a presidential elector in 1792, and cast his votes for George Washington and George Clinton. In 1795, Yates was also a founding trustee of Union College.\n\nIn 1746, Yates was married to Antje De Ridder (1726–1795), the daughter of Cornelis De Ridder and Susanna (née Vandenbergh) De Ridder. Together, they were the parents of five children, Christoffel, another Christoffel, Tanneke, Cornelis, only one of whom survived to adulthood:\n\n\nYates died in Albany on June 30, 1796, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.\n\nThrough his only surviving child Susanna, he was the grandfather of fourteen, including: Jannetje, who died unmarried; Abraham, who died young; Gerrit Yates, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives who married Helen Ten Eyck (daughter of Abraham Ten Eyck); Cornelius De Ridder; John, who died unmarried; Antje, who died young; Sanders Jr., who married Angelica Schuyler; Christopher Yates, who married Caroline Mary Thomas; Anna, who married Rev.

The aft end of the boat is the stern.\n\nA ship's bow should be designed to enable the hull to pass efficiently through the water. Bow shapes vary according to the speed of the boat, the seas or waterways being navigated, and the vessel's function. Where sea conditions are likely to promote pitching, it is useful if the bow provides reserve buoyancy; a flared bow (a raked stem with flared topsides) is ideal to reduce the amount af water shipped over the bow.\n\nIdeally, the bow should reduce the resistance and should be tall enough to prevent water from regularly washing over the top of it. Large commercial barges on inland waterways rarely meet big waves and may have remarkably little freeboard at the bow, whereas fast military vessels operating offshore must be able to cope with heavy seas. On slower ships like tankers and barges, a fuller bow shape is used to maximise the volume of the ship for a given length. The bow may be reinforced to serve as an ice-breaker.\n\nThe forward part of the bow is called the \"stem\" or \"forestem\". Traditionally, the stem was a timber (or metal) post into which side planks (or plates) were joined. Some boats such as the Dutch barge \"aak\" or the clinker-built Viking longships have no straight stem, having instead a curved prow.\n\nSeveral types of bows exist. These include:\n\nFrom Middle Dutch \"boech\" or Old Norse \"bógr\" (shoulder). Thus it has the same origin as the English \"bough\" (from the Old English \"bóg\", or \"bóh\", (shoulder, the bough of a tree) but the nautical term is unrelated, being unknown in this sense in English before 1600.\n\nThe \"prow\" (French : \"proue\") is the forward-most part of a ship's bow above the waterline. The terms \"prow\" and \"bow\" are often used interchangeably to describe the most forward part of a ship and its surrounding parts.\n\n"}

From 1549 to 1554, by order of the viceroy Vega, Torre del caricatore of Girgenti, already known during the ancient times (as it probably already existed before the Angevin period), was restored. It had been built to protect against the Saracen pirates, together with the whole system of the Coastal towers of Sicily.\nThe tower was later again restored by Charles III with the help of Bishop . This restoration was completed only in 1763. In 1853, during the government of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies the town obtained \nindependence by becoming chief town of the decurionato under the name of Molo di Girgenti. Then, in 1863, the town changed its name into Porto Empedocle in memory of the Agrigentine philosopher Empedocles.\n\nIn 2003, the town changed its official denomination to Porto Empedocle Vigata, after the name of the fictional town where the novels by Andrea Camilleri, Italian writer and native of the town, about detective Inspector Montalbano are placed. However, the decision was revoked in 2009.\n\nThe main church is Parrocchia Maria SS.del Buon Consiglio, which is located in the center of the town.

{"id": "1989803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989803", "title": "Systems Applications Products audit", "text": "Systems Applications Products audit\n\nSystems Applications Products audit is an audit of a computer system from SAP to check its security and data integrity. SAP is the acronym for Systems, Applications, Products. It is a system that provides users with a soft real-time business application. It contains a user interface and is considered very flexible. In an SAP audit the two main areas of concern are security and data integrity. \n\nSystems, Applications, Products in data processing, or SAP, was originally introduced in the 1980s as SAP R/2, which was a system that provided users with a soft real-time business application that could be used in multiple currencies and languages. As client–server systems began to be introduced, SAP brought out a server based version of their software called SAP R/3, henceforth referred to as SAP, which was launched in 1992. SAP also developed a graphical user interface, or GUI. \n\nFor the next 12 years SAP dominated the large business applications market. It was successful primarily because it was flexible. Because SAP was a modular system (meaning that the various functions provided by it could be purchased piecemeal) it was a versatile system. A company could simply purchase modules that they wanted and customize the processes to match the company’s business model. SAP’s flexibility, while one of its greatest strengths is also one of its greatest weaknesses that leads to the SAP audit.\n\nThere are three main enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems used in today’s larger businesses: SAP, Oracle, and PeopleSoft. ERP's are specifically designed to help with the accounting function and the control over various other aspects of the companies business such as sales, delivery, production, human resources, and inventory management. Despite the benefits of ERP’s, there are many potential pitfalls that companies who turn to ERP’s occasionally fall into.\n\nSecurity is the first and foremost concern in any SAP audit. There should be proper segregation of duties and access controls, which is paramount to establishing the integrity of the controls for the system. When a company first receives SAP it is almost devoid of all security measures. When implementing SAP a company must go through an extensive process of outlining their processes and then building their system security from the ground up to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper access. Proper profile design and avoidance of redundant user ID’s and superuser access will be important in all phases of operation. Along with this comes the importance of ensuring restricted access to terminals, servers, and the data center to prevent tampering. Because each company will have different modules each company’s security structure will be distinctly different. \n\nA typical Example from SAP will be Creating a Vendor and also able to pay an invoice. The Create a Vendor Transaction is XK01 and pay invoice transaction FB60. If the User or Role in SAP has those two transactions then it will create a SOD Risk. \n\nWith security it all starts at the beginning with the proper design and implementation of security and access measures for employees. For new employees it is important that their access is set up properly and that future access granted has proper approval. After the system has been implemented the control over system changes and the approval process required for it is vital to ensure the continued security and functionality of the system. Without proper security measures in place from start to finish there will be a material weakness in the controls of the system because of this there will likely be some level of fraud as well.\nThrough security you are able to monitor who has access to what data and processes and ensure that there is sufficient segregation of duties so as to prevent someone from perpetrating fraud. One of the major advantages of SAP is that it can be programmed to perform various audit functions for you. One of the most important of those is for reviewing user access and using the system to cross check based on an access matrix to ensure that proper segregation is in place so a person with payment request access does not also have access to create a vendor.\n\nAfter ensuring that security is set up to ensure proper segregation of duties the next area of concern surrounding security is with regards to system changes. All companies should have three different systems: the development system, the test system, and the production system. All changes to production will need to be run through an approval process and be tested to ensure that they will function properly when introduced into the production system. The security around who can authorize a change and who can pull that change through into production is paramount to ensuring the security and integrity of the system. Review of this process and the people involved with it will be a key to the audit of the system. \nThe goal of auditing the access, steps and procedures for system updates is to ensure proper controls over change management of the system and to ensure that proper testing and authorization procedures are being used.\n\nBecause SAP integrates data from legacy systems it is important to ensure that the mapping of the interaction between the legacy systems and SAP is thorough and complete. Without that, any data received from SAP would be suspect. It is also important that proper backups of the database be maintained along with an up-to-date and practiced disaster recovery plan to ensure continuity after a disaster. A thorough review of these plans along with the mapping of system interfaces will be important in this phase of the audit. However because all SAP data are stored on inter-related tables it is possible for users with certain security to change them. It is important that the output be verified to ensure accuracy. SAP does provide some basic audit programs to assist with the review of data to ensure that it is processing properly. It is also customizable so that a user can create a program to audit a specific function. \n\nThe monitoring of change management, the moving of updates to the system from the development stage is one of the key elements of this particular concern. Because of this, review of the process of review and pull through to production needs to be a high priority.\n\nControls around the system need to be reviewed, especially around the accounts payable and accounts receivable sub ledgers. Auditors must perform or review reconciliations between SAP and external information such as bank reconciliation and A/P statement reconciliation. They must review cost center and responsibility accounting, management review and budgetary control and the route of authorization for non-routine transactions.\nThe audit review should include a review of validation of data that is input in certain transactions, the design of ABAP statements and their authority checks matching documents prior to closing. Also, with regard to the master file control there must be an independent review of master file changes and creation of transactional responsibilities to identify any redundant master files.\n\nWhen it comes to data integrity the primary concerns are the integration of data from the legacy systems and then ensuring that data being input into the system for processing has been properly approved and is accompanied by the proper documentation. Through reviewing these aspects of the processing from implementation through to production you can gain reasonable confidence that the controls surrounding the data are sufficient and that the data are likely free of material error. The use of the built in audit functions will greatly assist with this process and the ability to create your own audit programs will allow you to customize the work to the company you are working with.\n\nThe two major control risks that need to be monitored with SAP are security and data integrity. To ensure that both are sufficient it is important that both be properly outlined and developed during implementation. User profiles must be designed properly and access must be sufficiently segregated to minimize the chance of fraud. Use of the SAP audit functions to cross check the user access with the matrix of allowable accesses is the quickest and easiest way to ensure that duties and access are properly segregated. New and old users must be entered and removed promptly and avoidance and monitoring of any super user access is imperative. Review of the access to upload and pull through changes to production and review of the associated authorization process is important from both a security and data integrity point of view.\n\nTo further ensure data integrity it is important that proper documentation be reviewed along with confirmation of any external data available either through a legacy system or through a third party. This is important with regard to certain sensitive accounts, such as accounts payable. Review of controls around budgets and management review and also review of authorization for non-routine transactions and physical access will be imperative to ensuring the accuracy of the data input and output from the system. The use of and development of tools within SAP will help accelerate this process and help to ensure that it is accurate. These are the two most vital parts to any SAP audit and successful review of them should allow you to determine the adequacy of control around the SAP system and access to it to determine whether or not there are any material deficiencies with the systems control.\n\n\n"}

The museum has a small fleet of flying aircraft and a collection of static display aircraft outdoors.\n\nThe Yankee Air Force Inc. was founded in 1981 to pursue these goals:\n\nOn the night of October 9, 2004, the Yankee Air Museum's hangar on the northeast side of Willow Run Airport (KYIP) burned down. The B-17, B-25 and C-47 were saved through heroic efforts by museum volunteers. The Stinson was at another hangar. Everything else inside the hangar was destroyed, including the original prototype North American YOV-10A Bronco, Waco CG-4A Glider, a former Thunderbirds Republic F-105, Aero L-39, Link Trainer, artifacts, spare parts, tools, and the Museum's library.\n\nRebuilding plans were underway within days and in 2008, the museum transitioned from being a membership club to a director-driven organization with an 11-member board. The objective of the museum's fundraising arm, the Michigan Aerospace Foundation, was to build a greatly expanded, state-of-the-art aviation museum and aerospace facility to replace the lost facility. Ground was broken for a new museum building in April 2007.\n\nIn 2009, the museum purchased a building from the Michigan Institute of Aviation and Technology (MIAT), on D Street to the east of the airfield, intending it as the new home of the museum collection.\n\nIn summer 2010, the museum opened the David and Andrea Robertson Education Center in a 1938 schoolhouse that had been moved from another part of the Willow Run complex. This had been the officers' club for the USAAF detachments stationed at Willow Run during the war, and was apparently the schoolhouse for the boys living at Henry Ford's Willow Run Farm (a social experiment that used the Willow Run site in 1939 and 1940 before the airfield and industrial complex were ever conceived).\n\nThe museum reopened to the public on October 10, 2010, six years to the day after the fire. This allowed the museum to vacate Hangar Two, which was condemned by the Wayne County Airport Authority.\n\nThe museum became a Smithsonian Affiliate in July 2011.\n\nIn April 2013, Yankee Air Museum and RACER Trust, owner of the former General Motors Willow Run plant, announced a plan for Yankee Air Museum to acquire a portion of the factory, contingent upon the museum raising the funds necessary to preserve and secure their proposed portion of the facility. The museum would consolidate operations scattered on various parcels at Willow Run Airport into the 1941 landmark, designed by Albert Kahn, with the trust seeking to clear the remainder of the plant for redevelopment. The plant was used during World War II to manufacture B-24 bombers.\n\nThe campaign to save a portion of Willow Run for the Yankee Air Museum is called SaveTheBomberPlant.org, and is centered on a fundraising website by the same name. The campaign has attracted national and international attention from media outlets that include National Public Radio, The History Channel magazine, National Geographic TV, The Guardian (UK), and the (UK) Daily Mail.\n\nAfter extending the fundraising deadline to Oct. 1, and then to Nov. 1, 2013, on October 26, 2013, RACER Trust and the Yankee Air Museum again reached a new, and final, deadline extension agreement. The final deadline to raise the funds necessary to preserve a portion of the Willow Run plant for the Yankee Air Museum was May 1, 2014.\n\nAt the time of the May 1, 2014 deadline, the Yankee Air Museum had raised over $7 million of its original $8 million fundraising goal, which was enough to enable the trust to move forward and sign a purchase agreement with Yankee, with the actual purchase expected to be finalized in late summer or fall of 2014. The majority of the $8 million fundraising goal reflects separation costs to make the preserved portion of the plant viable as a standalone structure.\n\nThe remaining portion of the Willow Run complex, which includes over 95% of the historic building, has been sold to Walbridge, Inc., for redevelopment as a connected vehicle research and test facility. RACER Trust will demolish this portion of the building prior to turning the property over to Walbridge. Preparations for demolition of Willow Run Assembly facility, with the exception of the portion that the Yankee Air Museum is campaigning to save, were well underway as of August 2014, with much of the building already demolished.\n\nIn October 2014 the museum announced that it is changing its name to the National Museum of Aviation and Technology at Historic Willow Run.\n\nThe Yankee Air Museum's Collections & Exhibits building covers of floor space and houses permanent and rotating aviation and historical displays, restoration projects, a retail store and a movie theatre that is available to the public. It is also home to Yankee Air Museum staff and volunteers and has meeting rooms and banquet facilities for rent, machine shops and storage space for the museum collection. An outside area next to the museum is the new home of the air park.\nFrom 2007 until August 2011, the Yankee Air Museum's flyable aircraft were hangared at the Township Airport at Grosse Ile, Michigan.\n\n\n\n"}

He belonged to the Aulikara dynasty. He conquered much of the Indian subcontinent between c. 530-540 CE according to Mandsaur pillar inscription.\n\nTowards the end of the 5th century, India came under attack from the \"Hunas\". Yashodharman and possibly the Gupta emperor, Narasimhagupta, defeated a \"Huna\" army and their ruler Mihirakula in 528 CE and drove them out of India.\n\nThree inscriptions of Yasodharman have been found in Mandsaur. One of these, the Mandsaur stone inscription of Yashodharman-Vishnuvardhana is of samvat 589 (532 AD).\n\nThe Mandsaur stone inscription of Yashodharman-Vishnuvardhana was written in 532 CE, and records the construction of a well by a person named Daksha in Dashapura (modern Mandsaur, also often spelled Mandasor), during the rule of Yashodharman. The inscription mentions the victories of local ruler Yasodharman (and possibly Chalukya ruler Vishnuvardhana) over Northern and Eastern kingdoms. These kingdoms are not further specified, but it is known that Yashodhaman occupied most of the territories of the Alchon Huns or Hunas to the north, and the most of the territories of the Gupta Empire to the east following his victories. Only one more Gupta inscription is known after that date, a land grant in the area of Kotivarsha (Bangarh in West Bengal) by the last Gupta emperor Vishnugupta.

In a part of the Sondani inscription, Yasodharman thus praises himself for having defeated king Mihirakula:\n\nIn Line 5 of the Mandsaur pillar inscription, Yashodharman claims he vanquished his enemies and now controls the territory from the neighbourhood of the (river) Lauhitya (Brahmaputra River) to the \"Western Ocean\" (Western Indian Ocean), and from the Himalayas to mountain Mahendra.\n\nYashodharman thus conquered vast territories from the Hunas and the Guptas, although his short-lived empire would ultimately disintegrate between c. 530-540 CE.\n\n"}

It was released on January 24, 2005, jointly through DFA and Capitol Records in the United States and EMI elsewhere. The album encompasses genres that range from dance-punk to electronica. The album was critically acclaimed upon release and was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Many singles were released to promote the album, including the band's breakout \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\", which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart in March, 2005.\n\n\"LCD Soundsystem\" received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 86, based on 35 reviews.\n\nAndy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that \"LCD Soundsystem\" \"has few weak spots and unfolds smoothly as you listen to it from beginning to end.\" In his review for \"Rolling Stone\", Barry Walters said that the album showed that LCD Soundsystem were \"both underground hitmakers and bona fide album artists.\" \"Drowned in Sound\" critic Gareth Dobson called it \"a disparate yet cohesive collection of songs\" and said that \"the majority of \"LCD Soundsystem\" is an excellent thump into 2005.\" Simon Reynolds, writing in \"Blender\", wrote that the album's \"influences meld to form a seductive — if clearly deeply conflicted — self.\" While expressing disappointment that the album did not fully meet the expectations set by the band's early singles and lacked \"very many surprises here, either in the bank of sounds Murphy pulls out, or in how he uses them\", Dominique Leone of \"Pitchfork\" went on to award \"LCD Soundsystem\" the website's \"Best New Music\" accolade, though still concluding that it contained \"plenty of good-not-great stuff\" and was \"a tad unfocused\". Assigning the album a one-star honorable mention rating, Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" noted Murphy's alternation between \"dance guy or rock guy, optimist or cynic\".\n\n\"PopMatters\" Matt Cibula praised the inclusion of the second disc of previously released material, but stated that \"the real gems are to be found on the new stuff\" and called \"LCD Soundsystem\" \"a great record.\" Rob Ortenzi of \"Alternative Press\" described \"LCD Soundsystem\" as \"an album that will survive the fleeting tastes of cosmopolitan hipsters\" and stated that \"in two records' time, Murphy will be as respected as The Sugarhill Gang, Brian Eno and Suicide.\" \"No Ripcord\"s Ben Bollig said that the album had \"all the makings of a modern classic\" and that \"\"LCD Soundsystem\" is knowing and knowledgeable, inspired and inspirational. Intellectual without being snotty, encyclopaedic yet accessible, it takes the seemingly stalled electro model and kick-starts it into outer space.\"\n\nOnline music magazine \"Pitchfork\" placed \"LCD Soundsystem\" at number 113 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s.

His father, James Vance Jr., was a veteran of World War II. who died from cirrhosis of the liver when Vance was nine years old. \"When my old man died, I was convinced that it was my fault. I was convinced I was such a piece of shit that he'd rather die than hang out with me,\" Jim Vance later said. His grandparents and family raised him while his mother, Eleanor, lived and worked in Philadelphia. Vance felt his mother had abandoned him, fueling decades of resentment, and in later years, forgiveness.\n\nAs a teenager, Vance wanted to be a plumber like his grandfather, but his family encouraged him to attend college. Vance earned a Bachelor of Science degree in secondary education from Cheyney University, a historically black university in Cheyney, Pennsylvania. It was at Cheyney where Vance became a lifelong member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and built a life-long friendship with Ed Bradley.\n\nVance began his news career as a reporter for the \"Philadelphia Independent\" newspaper and WHAT-AM radio station, while simultaneously teaching English at Overbrook High School. A friend mentioned that WKBS-TV was searching for someone for their newly started news operation. Vance auditioned and realized that perhaps he may be working in the wrong profession. Vance worked as a reporter for WKBS-TV for one year and was later hired by NBC News to report for the network's affiliate Washington, D.C. station, WRC-TV in 1969.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1976 Vance was main co-anchor with Glen Rinker, becoming one of the first African Americans in that position in the United States. His unapologetic presence reportedly elicited racist hate mail and threats. Between 1976 and 1980, Vance co-anchored with Sue Simmons, a pairing that resulted in one of the first, if not the first, African-American co-anchors of a major market newscast.\n\nBeginning in 1989, Vance was part of the longest-running anchor team in Washington D.C. television, alongside co-anchor and health reporter Doreen Gentzler. Vance’s 11pm newscasts with Gentzler regularly drew more viewers than the prime-time shows of the three major cable news networks combined (CNN, Fox and MSNBC). Vance and sports anchor George Michael became internet sensations after laughing at a model who fell twice on a runway, resulting in millions of views. Vance appeared as himself in the 2009 movie \"State of Play\" and \"appeared\" as himself in a 2010 episode of the NBC series \"The Event\" and in a 2013 edition of NBC series \"The Blacklist\". Vance earned 19 Emmy Awards, one of which was for his coverage of the 1977 Hanafi Siege of three buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. He also won an Emmy for his coverage of the January 1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90 in the Potomac River that killed 78 people and a Metrorail train derailment the same day, which killed three people. Vance was also recognized as anchor and reporter for extended news coverage of Super Bowl XXII.\n\nVance also received multiple Emmy Awards for Outstanding News Anchor in 1987, 1991, 1997, 1999, and 2011. He also received a 1999 award as producer and reporter for WRC-TV's News4 at 6 broadcast. In 2014, Jim Vance received the Board of Governor's Award for outstanding achievement and community service.\n\nVance was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame on August 10, 2007, and was named \"Washingtonian of the Year\" by \"Washingtonian\" magazine in 1976 among many other awards for community service.\n\nVance lived in Silver Spring, Maryland. He was married to Margo L. Vance (deceased 2014), when he was 19 years old and has one daughter, Dawn, from that marriage. He was subsequently married to Barbara Schmidt-Vance and raised his second daughter Amani.(b. 1970). In 1987 he married his third wife, Kathy McCampbell Vance, a television producer and former WRC-TV executive. He has one stepson (Brendon b. 1976), two grandsons and one granddaughter.\n\nVance battled a cocaine addiction in the late 1970s and early 1980s, later going public with the ordeal. Vance checked into the Betty Ford Center in 1984. One night in 1987, Vance sat on the ground by the Potomac River at Great Falls, and he stuck his bird-hunting shotgun in his mouth and considered pulling the trigger. Vance stopped, lowered the shotgun, and cried. College friend Ed Bradley encouraged him to seek therapy, and Vance went for help at a dingy downtown support group \"full of old-school drunks\" the next day. In 2014, Vance spoke about his mother's verbal abuse of him as a child, and advocated against that form of discipline.\n\nIn May 2017, Vance revealed he was battling lung cancer, but would continue working through treatment. Vance died in his sleep on July 22, 2017. He was 75. At the time of his death, Vance was the region's longest-serving television news anchor with more than 45 years at WRC-TV.\n\n"}

Harrison was a prominent adviser to the president of the Philippine Commonwealth, as well as the next four Presidents of the Republic of the Philippines. He is the only former Governor-General of the Philippines to be awarded Philippine citizenship.\n\nHarrison was born in New York City, to Burton Harrison, a lawyer and private secretary to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Constance Cary Harrison, novelist and social arbiter. Through his mother, Harrison was great-grandson of Virginia-planter, Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Through Fairfax in birth and marriage, Harrison was also relative to United States founding fathers: Gouverneur Morris (his great-great-uncle), Thomas Jefferson, the Randolphs, the Ishams, the Carters, and Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nHarrison graduated from Yale College in 1895, where he was a member of the secret society Skull and Bones, and from the New York Law School in 1897. From 1897 to 1899, Harrison was an instructor in the Evening Division at New York Law School. He later left to serve in United States Army during the Spanish–American War, as an assistant adjutant general with the rank of captain.\n\nA member of the Democratic Party, Harrison was elected to the 58th United States Congress, and served from March 4, 1903, to March 3, 1905. In 1904, Harrison ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of New York. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law. He was again elected to the 60th, 61st, 62nd and 63rd United States Congresses, and served from March 4, 1907 to September 3, 1913, when he resigned to become Governor-General of the Philippines. His Harrison Narcotics Tax Act was eventually passed on December 17, 1914.\n\nDuring his service in the Far East, Harrison was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1920 presidential election. He lost the nomination to Governor of Ohio James M. Cox at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, who eventually lost to the Republican candidate Warren G. Harding.\n\nHarrison was Governor-General of the Philippines from 1913 to 1921 and advocated for and oversaw the process of Filipinization, or the transfer of authority to Filipinos in the United States territory's Insular Government to better prepare for independence. He was governor-general during the passages of the Philippine Autonomy Act, otherwise known as the Jones Act, which converted the partially elected Philippine Legislature with the appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house and the elected Philippine Assembly as the lower house, to a fully elected Philippine Legislature with the Philippine Senate replacing the now-dissolved Philippine Commission and the Philippine Assembly renamed the House of Representatives of the Philippines.\n\nDespite the length of his tenure as governor-general he vetoed only five bills, the least number by any American governor-general in the Philippines. His pro-Filipino stance made him a popular figure in the Philippines but also the object of criticism of conservative Americans who viewed his liberal governance as not supportive enough of U.S. interests.\n\nUnder his administration, the Governor-General's Spanish-era mansion called Malacañan Palace was expanded with the construction of an executive building. When he left the Philippines, Harrison lived in Scotland until being recalled to the Philippines in 1934 during a period of transition from an unincorporated territory of the United States to the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nManuel L. Quezon became the first President of the Commonwealth and Harrison was asked to be Quezon's principal advisor in November 1935. He served in that capacity for ten months. In 1936, Harrison expressed interest in acquiring Filipino citizenship but did not fulfill the required years of residency under the Naturalization Law. Upon Manuel Quezon's initiative, the National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 79, making him a naturalized Filipino citizen. Harrison returned to the position of advisor upon Quezon's request in May 1942, after Filipino and American troops had surrendered the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island during World War II and Quezon went into exile in the United States. Harrison would serve the government-in-exile.\n\nFrom November 1946 to February 1947, Harrison served as Commissioner of Claims in the civil service of the United States Army in Manila. He later served as an advisor to the first four presidents of the new Philippine Republic after the country's independence in 1946, serving as special adviser of foreign affairs to Manuel Roxas.\n\nAfter this latest service to the Philippines, Harrison retired to Spain for six years, then chose to move to Califon, New Jersey in August 1957.\n\nHarrison's first wife was Mary Crocker, daughter of California railroad and mining magnate Charles Frederick Crocker. They married on June 7, 1900. She died in 1905 in an automobile accident leaving Harrison to raise two small daughters, the elder Virginia Randolph Harrison and the younger Barbara Harrison Wescott. Harrison would marry and divorce four more times to: Mabel Judson Cox, Elizabeth Wrentmore, Margaret Wrentmore and Doria Lee. His last wife, Maria Teresa Larrucea, a young Basque woman, was born in Amorebieta (Bizkaia, Spain) and outlived Harrison.\n\nHarrison died on November 21, 1957 at Hunterdon Medical Center in Raritan Township near Flemington, New Jersey. He willed that he be buried in the Philippines and he was interred in the Manila North Cemetery in La Loma, Manila.\n\nF.B. Harrison Avenue in the Metro Manila city of Pasay, starting in Baclaran, Parañaque and ends in Pablo Ocampo Street (formerly Vito Cruz) in the City of Manila, was named after him. Harrison Road in Baguio City, a major thoroughfare beginning in the city center past Burnham Park and ending near the Baguio Convention Center, is also named for Harrison.\n\n"}

His mother was Margaret, daughter of Sir George Erskine of Innerteil, lord Innerteil, a lord of the court of session.\n\nHe was educated at the St Andrews University and King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated in 1646. He became an accomplished classical scholar, and cultivated interests in literature and science, but politics was his chief interest. In 1653, he joined Glencairn's uprising on behalf of Charles II, and on the defeat of John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton, on 26 July 1654, fled to the castle of Eilean Donan. He succeeded to the family estates on his father's death on 10 September 1654, but after escaping to the continent, remained in exile until the Restoration, occupying much of his leisure in the study of law.\nOn the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Middleton, Mackenzie's old commander, had the management of Scottish affairs, and Mackenzie was his chief confidant.\n\nHis relative, Sir George Mackenzie, describes him as at this time \"a passionate cavalier\" but keen ambition influenced his political conduct as much as passion or prejudice.\n\nOn 14 February 1661, he was nominated a Lord of Session with the judicial title of Lord Tarbat, and was elected the same year a member of the estates for the shire of Ross.\n\nHe is credited by Sir George Mackenzie with being the chief originator of the act passed in 1661 rescinding all statutes passed in the Parliament of 1640 and subsequently, but the chief aim of the act was to prepare for the establishment of episcopacy. It was not likely suggested to Tarbat by Archbishop Sharp.\n\nIn their policy on behalf of episcopacy, Middleton and Tarbat found themselves at this time opposed by John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, the Minister for Scottish Affairs.\nThey resolved therefore, to ruin him, the design being that Tarbat, who 'was then much considered at court, as one of the most extraordinary men that Scotland had produced', should succeed to Lauderdale's place as Secretary of State.\n\nTo this end, in 1662, they devised the famous 'act of billeting,' the credit of which probably belongs to Tarbat. \nThe proposal was by a secret vote of the estates to declare certain persons incapable of holding any office of public trust; but when the result of the vote — which disqualified Lauderdale among others — was sent up to the king he 'threw the act of billeting into his cabinet, declaring that he would not follow their advice nor would he disclose their secret'.\n\nFurther inquiry, instigated by Lauderdale, led to the discovery that Middleton had been misleading both the king and the parliament, and he was dismissed from office, while Tarbat, for his connection with the intrigue, was on 16 February 1664 deprived of his seat on the bench.\n\nHe remained in disgrace till 1678, when, through the offices of Sharp with the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale, he was on 16 October appointed Lord Justice General of Scotland. \nOn the following day he received a pension of £200 from Charles II, and on November was admitted a privy councillor of Scotland. \nThe day after his admission he presented a letter from the king, to be recorded in the books of sederunt, intimating the king's pardon for his connection with the act of billeting. \nOn 1 October 1681, he was appointed Lord Clerk Register, and on 11 November following was again admitted one of the ordinary lords of session.\nOn the fall of Lauderdale in 1682, Tarbat succeeded to the position of chief minister of the king in Scotland, and retained this position till the revolution. \nShortly after the accession of James II, he was on 15 Feb. 168S created Viscount of Tarbat and Lord Macleod and Castlehaven in the peerage of Scotland to him and heirs male of his body.\nAt the revolution Tarbat, so soon as he discerned that the cause of James was lost, resolved if possible to secure his own safety and his continuance in power. \nBy advising in council the disbanding of the militia, he greatly facilitated the peaceful establishment of the new government. \nIn the 'Leven and Melville Papers' (p. 14) there is printed, under date 25 April 1689, an exoneration and discharge to him of his office of register, securing him — on account of his faithful service both in putting 'in order and method' the various documents under his charge and recovering many that were missing — 'from all danger in his person or estate, notwithstanding of any acts, writings, councils, speeches, or any crimes committed by him.' \nIt would appear, however, that he was not finally exonerated until after 17 January 1690.\n\nIn 1689, he sent a memorial to the government, proposing a joint recognition of presbytery and episcopacy. After Killiecrankie he was employed by the government to treat with the Highland clans. He thoroughly understood Highland politics, and his prudent counsel was of considerable advantage in bringing about a settlement. If, says Macaulay, his plan (of distributing a few thousands sterling among the Highland chiefs) had been tried when he recommended it, instead of two years later, 'it would probably have prevented much bloodshed and confusion'. On 5 March 1692, he was restored to the office of clerk register, but resigned it towards the close of 1695. According to Secretary Johnstone, he had been caught 'grossly malversizing in his office of clerk both in public and in private business'.\nOn the accession of Queen Anne, Tarbat was on 21 November 1702 appointed one of the Secretaries of State, and on 1 January 1703, was created Earl of Cromarty. Subsequently, he was chosen as a representative peer. In 1704, he resigned the office of secretary, and on 26 June 1705 was made lord justice general, retaining office till 1710.\n\nLockhart states that though 'he pretended to favour the Royal Family [the family in exile] and the episcopal clergy, yet he never did one act in favour of any of them, excepting that when he was secretary to Queen Anne he procured an Act of Indemnity and a letter from her recommending the episcopal clergy to the Privy Council's protection; but whether this proceeded from a desire and design of serving them is easy to determine when we consider that no sooner did Queen Anne desert the Tory party and maxims, but his Lordship turned as great a Whig as the best of them, joined with Tweedale's party to advance the Hanoverian succession in the Parliament 1704, and was at last a zealous stickler and writer in favour of the Union'. \nCromarty's able and judicious advocacy of the union with England is, however, his chief title to honour as a statesman, and atones for much that was foolish and inconsistent in his career.\n\nHe died at New Tarbat 17 August 1714, and was buried, not as he had directed beside his second wife at Wemyss, but beside his ancestors at Dingwall.\n\nBy his first wife, Anna, daughter of Sir James Sinclair of Mey, baronet, he had four sons : Roderick, who died young ; John, who succeeded his father; Kenneth, and James. James had a daughter who married to become the eccentric Lady Anne Dick.\n\nBy his second wife, Margaret, countess of Wemyss, he had no issue.\n\nCromarty retained through life varied interests outside politics. He was consulted by Sir Robert Moray in regard to the formation of the Royal Society of London, and contributed to its 'Transactions' the following papers: \n\nAn 'Account of Hirta and Rona' (islands of the Hebrides) was published in 'Miscellanea Scotica,' 1818, ii. 79. He published a large number of political pamphlets, some of which are now rare. They include:\n\nHis other works are: \n\nHis 'Vindication of the Reformation of the Church of Scotland, with some Account of the Records,' was printed in the \"Scots Magazine\" for 1802 from a manuscript in the possession of Constable, the publisher. A 'History of the Family of Mackenzie,' by Sir George Mackenzie, first earl of Cromarty, is printed in Fraser's \"Earls of Cromartie,\" ii. 462-573.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

The district operates and manages the public schools in the city of Fort Collins, as well as in the towns of Wellington, Timnath and Windsor, and unincorporated communities of Larimer County including Laporte and Livermore. The district is one of the fastest growing in Northern Colorado, adding 500 students — about the size of an elementary school — each year.\n\nThe district was formed in 1960 by the consolidation of several dozen existing districts in Larimer County, and is the ninth largest in the state. The district manages 31 elementary schools, 10 middle schools, four comprehensive high schools, and four alternative high schools. Additionally, the district manages community early childhood education programs and special transition facilities for students with disabilities. Five Fort Collins charter schools are chartered through PSD, including the Fort Collins Montessori School, Mountain Sage Community School, Ridgeview Classical School and Liberty Common Elementary and High School. The district is led by a seven-member Board of Education.\n\nThe school district is the second-largest employer in Fort Collins. The minimum teacher salary in PSD is $36,207, and the maximum $83,690. The average teacher salary of $53,383 is slightly higher than the state average. In the 2015–2016 school year, the district had a total PK-12 enrollment of 29,527.\nThe first school in Fort Collins was a one-room school house located in Auntie Stone's cabin from 1866-1887. In 1887, the Franklin building was completed at the corner of Mountain and Howes and the students all moved to the new facility. The Fort Collins High School occupied the top floor of the Franklin building, and the lower grades, 1st-8th, met together in the bottom of the building. In 1903, the high school and several of the grade level classes were moved to a new location on Meldrum street where the current Lincoln Center now stands. Through this period of time, the middle grades were grouped together with the lower grades and simply called the grade school. By 1920, Wellington and Waverly both had junior high schools. But it wasn't until 1922 that Fort Collins rearranged the grades in order to have a junior high. In the beginning, the junior high only consisted of eighth grade, with most of the students located within the Fort Collins High School building. In 1925, the high school moved to a new location, 1400 Remington Street (now used for the arts at CSU), and the junior high took over the building. A memorial to the old school building, written at the time of its demolition in the mid-1970s, states that the Fort Collins Junior High was departmentalized in 1928.\n\nThere are four comprehensive public senior high schools in Fort Collins Colorado operated by the Poudre School District. Each serves students in different neighborhood sections of the city. The district also operates four alternative high schools for students who thrive in smaller environments or require flexible educational options. Two public charter high schools are chartered through PSD: Ridgeview Classical Schools and Liberty Common High School. Together the schools serve roughly 8,000 students.\nPoudre School District is one of the fastest growing districts in northern Colorado, adding about 500 students (equivalent to the size of an elementary school) every year. To accommodate the rapid growth, the district plans to build three new schools. These will include one combined middle/high school in Wellington, another middle/high school east of I-25, and one elementary school in southeast Fort Collins. The school board approved the long-range facilities plan on April 26, 2016, opening the possibility of seeking an associated $375 million bond to fund the construction. Board members were scheduled to decide by Aug. 9, 2016 whether to include the bond vote on the November 2016 ballot. Increasing property values within district boundaries, coupled with the retirement of a former bond debt, means the current property tax rate would not increase for residents, the \"Fort Collins Coloradoan\" reports.\n\nIf the bond is not approved by the board or passed by voters, the school district will implement an alternative growth plan to accommodate the booming student population, including managing school choice, adding modular classrooms outside crowded schools, changing school boundaries and creating larger class sizes.\n\nPSD has received several national awards for its efforts to reduce environmental impact and utility costs and educate students on sustainability. PSD was one of the first school districts in the country to create a Sustainability Management System in 2006, which integrates all schools and departments into a plan to reduce environmental impact. Since then, the district has achieved over 300 Energy Star awards from the US Environmental Protection Agency for energy efficiency, and saved over $2 million in electrical and natural gas costs.\n\nIn 2016, the US Department of Education recognized Poudre School District as a Green Ribbon Schools District Sustainability Awardee, one of just 15 districts across the country to earn the award. The award recognizes the district's success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5,000 tons since 2006, diverting nearly 1,000 tons of waste (the environmental equivalent of planting more than 16,000 trees and letting them grow for a decade), and creating curriculum that teaches the principles of sustainability.\n\nAdditionally, the US Department of Energy recognized PSD as one of the top five Education Sector partners to reach and exceed both its water and energy savings goals in the 2016 Better Buildings Challenge. The district achieved 25 percent energy savings over the last five years, and a 29 percent reduction in water use.\n\nFunds from the 2010 bond/mill levy override were used to improve access to educational technology in all schools. The money provided for a team of ed tech trainers, who teach teachers how to integrate technology like laptops and SmartBoards into their classroom through hands-on collaboration and professional development classes. As a result, teachers have produced curriculum, such as Skyping national experts into the classroom to chat with students about hot topics, or integrating NPR podcasts into English classes to connect classic novels to modern day injustices. PSD's goal is to provide a learning environment for all students that closely resembles 21st-century workplaces.\n\nPartnerships with local engineering companies like HP, Intel, Otterbox, Avago, and AMD have proved beneficial for students, exposing them to concepts like design thinking during the annual elementary Engineering Week and providing resources to create dynamic Maker Spaces in school media centers, areas open to any student that are outfitted with everything from 3D printers to sewing machines.\n\nThis year, a female undergrad student attending Colorado State University started an engineering club just for girls at Zach Elementary School, to provide the kind of hands-on engineering experiences she wished she'd had growing up.\n\nFrench Field is a sporting arena in Fort Collins Colorado that is used primarily by the city's four public senior high schools for their sporting events such as football, soccer, lacrosse, and track and field events. It was initially constructed in 1974, located on the Rocky Mountain High School campus. The stadium is capable of seating 6,000 spectators and is used for day and nighttime events, and is equipped with full field lighting.\n\nBecause French Field is immediately adjacent to Rocky Mountain High School, a common misconception is to assume that is used only by Rocky Mountain High School. However, it is also used by the other public senior high schools, including Poudre High School, Fort Collins High School and Fossil Ridge High School. \n\nThe stadium is equipped with a standard football field and goalposts but is also marked for use in soccer and lacrosse games. The stadium also has an all-weather track that circles the playing field. This is used by the Poudre School District for its track and field events, which involve not only the city's high schools, but also many junior high schools and elementary schools. Other non-Poudre School District sports leagues do sometimes make use of the stadium for championship events, but in general the stadium is used only for school-related athletic events. Approximately thirty-five to forty athletic events take place at the stadium each fall and spring.\n\nFrench Field is capable of seating 6,000 spectators, with the stadium divided into home and away bleachers. The home team stands are larger in width and height. Several press boxes also sit atop the home bleachers and are used by school coaches, stadium announcers, and radio sportscasters. French Field's away stands are smaller, since games are typically played against out-of-city teams; however, on occasion, in-town teams are pitted against each other, and the away school can easily fill French Field's away bleachers. Six floodlight towers are capable of fully illuminating the field for nighttime games. Both sets of spectator stands offer concessions stands and bathrooms, but away stands have only two ticket windows, while the home stands operate four. There are basic locker rooms for both home and away sports teams and officials, and Poudre Valley Hospital provides ambulance services to all varsity football games and many other sporting events.\n\nNew sound and lighting systems as well as a new scoreboard were installed in 2007, and the stadium's press boxes and ticket booths were updated with newer electrical and heating systems since its initial construction in 1974.\n\n"}

After being noticed by rapper C-Murder, it was suggested that Master P sign Magic to No Limit Records. He was intended to become part of TRU, but Master P decided that he instead rap solo on the parent label.

It is made of oil, vinegar, ketchup, sugar, and other flavorings.\n\nIn the 19th century, \"French dressing\" was synonymous with vinaigrette. Starting in the early 20th century, American recipes for \"French dressing\" often added other flavorings to the vinaigrette, including Worcestershire sauce, onion juice, ketchup, sugar, and tabasco sauce, but kept the name. By the 1920's, bottled French dressing was being sold as \"Milani's 1890 French Dressing\", but it is not clear whether it included ketchup at the time. The modern version is sweet and colored orange-to-red from the use of paprika and tomatoes. French dressing is generally pale orange and creamy, while \"\"Catalina\" French dressing\" is bright red and less creamy.\n\nCommon brands of French dressing in the United States include: Annie's, Dorothy Lynch, Heinz, Ken's, Kraft, Newman's Own, Marzetti, Wish-Bone.\n\nIn the United States, French dressing is regulated by federal standards. The Association of Dressings and Sauces is lobbying to remove this regulation.\n\nIn Canada, the Food and Drug Regulations of the Foods and Drugs Act state that French dressing must be prepared using a combination of vegetable oil and vinegar or lemon juice and the final product must contain at least 35 percent vegetable oil.\n\n"}

Called \"Clericus Regis\" (although some have applied that to the Lord Clerk Register), he was regarded as an Officer of State. The Secretary was constantly to attend the King's person, receive the petitions and memorials that were presented to him, and write the King's answers upon them. All Letters Patent passed through his hands, and were drawn up by him as with all the King's letters and dispatches, warrants, orders, &c. In the case of lengthy documents a short docket was also subscribed by the Secretary for the King's perusal, as a summary; and as all the writings signed by the King came through his hands, he was answerable for them if they contained anything derogatory to the laws or the dignity of The Crown. \n\nFrom 1626 until their respective deaths, King Charles I divided the duties between two Secretaries, the Earl of Glencairn and Sir Archibald Achison of Glencairn.\n\nThe Secretary did not invariably sit in the Parliament of Scotland after 1603, because his duties normally involved his attendance upon the monarch who was thereafter resident in England.

Johnson to become the party's nominee in the 1968 presidential election. Their opposition to Johnson stemmed mainly from their opposition to the Vietnam War, while the movement can be seen as part of an internal battle within the Democratic Party between antiwar liberals, unreconstructed Cold Warriors and moderates.\n\nWithin the left wing of the Democratic Party there had been rumbles all during 1967 of challenging Johnson's candidacy. The leading proponents of the Dump Johnson Movement were two opponents of the war, Allard K. Lowenstein and Curtis Gans. Their first choice to be a candidate was Robert F. Kennedy, but the New York Senator declined after a series of meetings in September and October 1967. When he declined, they next turned to California Congressman Don Edwards, Idaho Senator Frank Church, Canadian-born economist John Kenneth Galbraith, retired U.S. Army General James M. Gavin, and South Dakota Senator George S. McGovern, all of whom similarly declined. Finally, in mid-October Lowenstien approached Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy and found to his surprise that the Senator was willing. 'Somebody has to raise the flag,' McCarthy remarked. Six days later, in a meeting with Lowenstein and another liberal leader McCarthy made his decision definite. \"You guys have been talking about three or four names. I think you can cut the list down to one now.\" \n\nJohnson's thoughts of running received a fresh blow on March 12, when McCarthy shocked the country by winning 42 percent of the New Hampshire primary, at which point Kennedy belatedly entered the race, splitting the anti-war opposition between two candidates. Lowenstein and many other antiwar activists remained committed to McCarthy, seeing Kennedy's late entry as opportunistic and divisive.\n\nOn Sunday evening, March 31, at the close of his televised address to the nation on Vietnam, Johnson declared, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President\". Johnson had withdrawn from the 1968 Democratic candidate race.\n\nBetween them, McCarthy and Kennedy received more than 5.3 million votes in the Democratic primaries, far more than any other candidates. Kennedy's candidacy ended with his assassination following the California primary on June 5. \n"}

His shrine is located next to this house. The whole area was called \"Al-Bahjá\" (\"Place of Delight\").\n\nThe area was originally a garden planted by Sulayman Pasha, who was the ruler of Acre, for his daughter Fatimih, and he named it Bahji. Later the area was further beautified by ʻAbdu'llah Pasha, and in 1831 when Ibrahim Pasha besieged Acre he used the property as his headquarters. The property was well known for its beautiful gardens and pond fed by an aqueduct. The property then fell into the possession of a Christian family, the Jamals.\n\nIn 1870 ʻUdi Khammar, a wealthy merchant from Acre who also originally owned the House of ʻAbbúd, bought some of the land from the Jamals close to the mansion of ʻAbdu'llah Pasha and built the Mansion of Bahji, over an earlier and smaller building, which Abdu'llah Pasha had had built for his mother. ʻUdi Khammar had built the house for his family, and when he died was buried in a tomb in the south-east corner of the wall directly around the building. In 1879 an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee and the building became vacant.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá first rented, and then purchased, the mansion for Baháʼu'lláh and the Baháʼí holy family to live in, and Baháʼu'lláh moved from Mazra'ih to Bahji and resided in the building until his death. In 1890 the Cambridge orientalist Edward Granville Browne met Baháʼu'lláh in this house; after this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Baháʼu'lláh. \n\nWhen Baháʼu'lláh died in 1892 he was interred in one of the surrounding buildings, and that building became the shrine of Baháʼu'lláh. After his death in 1898, Baháʼu'lláh's son Ḍíyáʼu'lláh was initially buried next to his father. However, having been declared a Covenant-breaker, Ḍíyáʼu'lláh's remains were disinterred in a \"process\" of \"purification\" through \"cleansing\" the \"inner sanctuary\" of the \"most hallowed shrine\", the \"Qiblih\" of the \"Baháʼí World\". The site has since been beautified with paradise gardens, which are termed \"Haram-i-Aqdas\" (the Most Holy Precincts or Sanctuary) and are intersected by a circular path which serves to circumambulate the shrine of Baháʼu'lláh. The Mansion, shrine, and surrounding gardens are among the most sacred spots on earth for Baháʼís and are Baháʼí pilgrimage sites.\n\nOn November 12, 1952, a cablegram sent by Shoghi Effendi announced the \"acquisition of vitally-needed property\" of the Mansion of Bahji and the area around it from \"the Development Authority of the State of Israel...The exchange of said property, including land and houses, was made possible by the precipitate flight of the former Arab owners.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The song was published in 1952 and was written especially for the 1953 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film \"The Band Wagon\". The song is performed in the film by Jack Buchanan supported by Fred Astaire, Nanette Fabray, and Oscar Levant. In 2004, the song finished at #45 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\nSince the movie, the song has become the signature tune for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and an anthem for Hollywood and theater in general, being used as an opening number in many shows. Alongside \"Hooray for Hollywood,\" \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" and \"Another Op'nin', Another Show\", it is considered one of the entertainment industry's best known tunes. The song is perhaps most associated with Judy Garland, who recorded it for her 1960 LP \"That's Entertainment!\". A year later, a live version appeared on Garland's Grammy-winning double album \"Judy at Carnegie Hall\".\n\nThe song has become nearly synonymous with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The studio used the tune for its 1955-56 television series \"MGM Parade\" which featured clips from past and forthcoming MGM films. The song title was later used for MGM'S popular retrospective film series featuring clips from its golden age, as \"That's Entertainment!\". The original 1974 release spawned two sequels in which the song was retained.\n\nIn \"That's Entertainment, Part II\", some new lyrics were added to the song and performed by hosts Gene Kelly and Astaire. The film credited those lyrics to Dietz and Saul Chaplin, one of the film's producers, though Chaplin was known as a composer, not a lyricist.\n\nIn 1979, the song was sung with parody lyrics by the villain Mordru in the television special \"Legends of the Superheroes\". In the 1980s, the song was performed, again with new lyrics, by Larry Santos in a commercial for \"TV Guide\" magazine.\n\n"}

Her mother was not married and was 17 when Edna was born. Her natural father never was revealed, and Jones later married Maurice Kahly. Jones and Kahly had a daughter together, named Dorothy. Edna worked as a clerk at Mutual Life Insurance to support her mother and sister, but was sent to live with her aunt and uncle, an executive at Texas & Pacific Coal and Thurber Brick Company in Fort Worth, Texas in 1904. Edna's aunt was involved in Fort Worth society and women's clubs, and Edna quickly moved into these social circles as well.\n\nThough expecting to only stay in Fort Worth for a few months, Edna stayed longer, and in 1906, she met Sam Gladney, a native of Gainesville, Texas who worked at Medlin Mills. After a summer of courtship, Gladney left her fiancé from Wisconsin and eloped with Gladney two days before their planned wedding. The Gladneys lived in Wolfe City, Texas from 1909 to 1913, then moved to Sherman, Texas where Sam had bought his own flour mill. Edna joined the Sherman Civic League and started inspecting local meat markets and public restrooms for cleanliness.\n\nOn one of these inspections, Gladney came across the Grayson County Poor Farm, which was little more than a dumping ground for the unwanted, poor, mentally ill, and handicapped. Appalled at the Poor Farm's conditions, especially for children, she enlisted the other Civic League members in a campaign for improvements beginning in 1917. The Civic League had a meeting with the Grayson County Commissioners Court, the local governing body and owners of the Poor Farm, where they declared it everyone’s responsibility to care for the children at the farm. Impatient for action, the women of the civic league, led by Gladney, went to the farm and personally cleaned it. Gladney then arranged the transfer of the children to the Texas Children’s Home and Aid Society in Fort Worth run by Reverend I.Z.T. Morris.\n\nBy 1910, Gladney had joined the board of directors for the Texas Children's Home and Aid Society. She studied settlement work and child welfare, and established a free day nursery in Sherman to provide childcare for working mothers who had moved into industrial jobs during World War I. Thirty-five women enrolled their children on opening day of the Sherman Day Nursery and Kindergarten for Working Mothers. The free day nursery was financed by Gladney and donations to collection boxes that she placed in local businesses. The day nursery was among the early daycare facilities in Texas and was operated by the City of Sherman until 2008.\n\nWhile living in Sherman, Gladney audited classes at the North Texas Female College. In 1921, the Gladneys returned to Fort Worth, where Edna attended classes at Texas Christian University. The Gladneys commissioned Edna's cousin, the renowned American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, to design a home in Fort Worth's Forest Park neighborhood, but the plans never were realized.\n\nGladney began to devote more and more of her time to the Texas Children’s Home and Aid Society, and by 1927, she had been named superintendent, a position she held until 1961. In 1929, Fort Worth publisher and philanthropist Amon G. Carter helped secure the first home for the Texas Children's Home and Aid Society. The large home, located on El Paso Street, was owned by the head of Texas Power and Light; Edna's mother oversaw daily operations of the facility until her death in 1938.\n\nAfter her husband died on Valentine’s Day in 1935, Gladney continued to make the welfare of unwanted children the center of her life, personally placing children with adoptive families. She continued the work of Reverend Morris by placing abandoned children with adoptive families. She also expanded the society’s activities to focus on the care of unmarried mothers and an adoption service for their babies. She focused her efforts on hard-to-place children during the Depression.\n\nIn 1950, the Texas Children’s Home and Aid Society bought the West Texas Maternity Hospital, which was renamed the Edna Gladney Home (now the Gladney Center for Adoption). The purchase of the hospital expanded services to birth mothers and provided prenatal care. This new agency also operated a baby home where infants received care until their adoption.\n\nGladney lobbied the Texas legislature to have the word \"illegitimate\" kept off birth certificates of adopted and abandoned children. She succeeded in 1936, making Texas the first state in the southwest to legally remove the stigma of illegitimacy. In 1939, Gladney successfully campaigned for a change in the Texas law that sealed the original birth certificates of adopted children and that made a second copy of the birth certificate, listing only the child's adoptive name and parents; the sealed original birth certificate only could be opened by court order. In 1951, Gladney helped to get a bill passed that gave adopted children the same inheritance rights as biological children and recognized that they should be legally adopted rather than placed in \"long-term guardianship.\"\n\nIn 1939, Ralph Wheelwright, an MGM publicist who had adopted a child from the Texas Children's Home, developed a story based on Gladney's work, which became the film \"Blossoms in the Dust.\" The 1941 film starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon as Edna and Sam Gladney, and was the first of eight films the actors made together. The film's sets, noted for their accuracy, were based on detailed photographs shot on location in Sherman, Fort Worth, and Austin, Texas. All of Gladney's proceeds from the film went back into funding the children's home.\n\nIll health forced Gladney into semi-retirement in 1960, but she remained active as an adviser until her death on October 2, 1961 from complications of diabetes. Gladney is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in East Fort Worth. Gladney placed over 10,000 babies with adoptive parents during her career and totally revolutionized adoption practices. She helped to grant adoptive children the same rights as \"natural\" children and gave orphaned children and many birth mothers a place to stay and a hospital where they could receive treatment. Gladney helped develop modern day adoption practices and removed the stigma of \"illegitimacy\" from birth records and from society. Gladney treated all of \"her\" children as if they were her own and continued correspondence with adopted children long after they had left her care.\n\nIn 2019, Gladney was excited to unveil a very special bronze bust of Mrs. Gladney by artist Linda Stinson. Stinson has art pieces in museums and hall of fame galleries throughout the United States. After collecting many photos and reading Edna’s life story, Linda began the long creative process of sculpting Edna in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe piece stands 5’3” tall, the same height of Edna Gladney. Although a hat was not in the original plan, Linda said Edna kept telling her “I need a hat.” Linda “listened” and the sculpture is wearing one of Edna’s signature hats. The pedestal contains a bronze base relief panel with 66 leaves, each leaf represents 150 babies that were adopted during Edna’s time of service at the Gladney Center. Each of the leaves have a birth date and baby’s name etched in them.\n\n"}

The toyline was initially divided into two main factions: the heroic MANTA Force and their opponents, the evil Viper Squad. Following the popularity of the MANTA Force toy range, an additional enemy was introduced in 1989; a group of robots known as the Karnoids, who were an enemy of both MANTA Force and the Viper Squad. The following year saw the release of the Stenchoids, which were another new threat for the humans. By the early 1990s however, the popularity of the toy range began to decrease and eventually production was stopped.\n\nBy 2012, humans had colonised many planets throughout the Solar System, including Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. The planet Earth however, had become polluted and overpopulated. In an attempt to save mankind, President Battaille ordered the creation of the M.A.N.T.A. ship. M.A.N.T.A. Force was an acronym for Multiple-Air-Naval-Terrain-Assault Force and was the most advanced Earth ship ever built. It was designed to work in any environment and its engine was fuelled by a substance called Thorium.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of the M.A.N.T.A. Force ship, the World Government created the Red Venom to help Manta Force colonise New Earth. On Saturn however, many of the people had grown tired of living in plastic bubbles and believed New Earth should belong to them. During its test runs therefore, the Red Venom was hijacked by a group of highly skilled soldiers called the Viper Squad. Under the command of Major Vex, the Viper Squad attempted to use the Red Venom to hijack the M.A.N.T.A. Force ship, so they could be the ones to colonise New Earth.\n\nLater the two opposing sides joined forces to fight off attacks from a cybernetic alien known as Mad Karnock, who was served by an army of robots called Karnoids. Another enemy also emerged from the swamps of New Earth in the form of the vile Stinkhorn, leader of the Stenchoids, who attempted to destroy the humans with their decomposing Stench weapons (which excreted a green compound similar to Play-Doh).\n\n\n\nIn September 1987, Eagle Comics released a comic-strip based on the Manta Force toyline. Starting with a prologue written by John Wagner & Alan Grant (under the pseudonym W. Steele) and illustrated by Ian Kennedy in issue 285, the main series ran between issues 286 - 305. It was written by Alan Hebden and illustrated by Mike Dorey. The purpose of the comic-strips was to provide a back-story to Manta Force universe and help to promote the Bluebird toy range. Following the conclusion of the comic-strip in Eagle Comics, Marvel Comics UK produced a one-shot special in 1989. Presently, it is unknown if Marvel Comics UK had planned to produce additional one-shot specials or even an ongoing series. Bluebird also published two promotional comics in the late 1980s, to promote the Black Barracuda and Vile Stinkhorn toy ranges.

The project envisions the construction of four major sea links over the Arabian Sea along Mumbai's western coastline to reduce traffic-congestion between the Western Suburbs and South Mumbai. \n\nThe first sea link, known as the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, was completed in June 2009, and connects Bandra in the north and Worli in the south with a cable stayed bridge spanning the Mahim Bay. This development relieved congestion on the Mahim Causeway, which until then had been the only road between the Western Suburbs and South Mumbai on the western sea front. The second sea bridge, the Versova–Bandra Sea Link, is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by September 2023.\n\nIn 2011, the Coastal Road was proposed as a lower-cost alternative to the Western Freeway. The 8-lane, 29.2-km long Coastal Road would run along Mumbai's western coastline connecting Marine Lines to Kandivali. The Coastal Road connects Marine Lines with the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link through roads built on reclaimed land and tunnels rendering the proposed Haji Ali-Nariman Point Sea Link and Worli-Haji Ali Sea Link of the Western Freeway redundant. Construction of a 9.98 km section of the Coastal Road between Marine Lines and Worli began in 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2023.\n\nThis section would have been an extension of the sea-link from Haji Ali to Priyadarshini Park, and onward to Malabar Hill. The section was sub-divided into the following:\n\nOn 16 April 2013, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan told the state Assembly that the Nariman Point–Haji Ali sea link was \"impractical\". Chavan stated, \"As far as the sea link is concerned, the consultant had ruled out the possibility of taking it further than Haji Ali. We will look at other alternatives.\" Chavan also said that he would promote a coastal road as an alternative to the sea link.\n\nThis section is the immediate extension of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link further into the heart of Mumbai city. The current design allows for a clover leaf junction at Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan Marg (at Worli) for ramp up of traffic onto the sea link. This includes twin carriageway of 3.315 km termed as main line and connectors at Worli and Haji Ali. While mainline is to be made of entirely precast segmental spans, the connectors will be made of segmental and I beams. A 10-lane toll plaza is proposed at the start of the section at Worli.\n\nThe Bandra-Worli Sea Link was opened to traffic on 30 June 2009. The Sea Link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli from 45–60 minutes to 7 minutes. The link has an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles per day. The toll charged is for one-way and for a return journey.\n\nThere are plans to add an 800 m bridge to turn the Worli connector from a 4-lane to 8-lane freeway.\n\nThe Versova-Bandra Sea Link (VBSL) is an Under Construction 9.89-km long sealink that connects Bandra with Versova. It is a northward extension of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The VBSL will be built on pillars 900 metres into the Arabian Sea. Juhu beach will have a 150-metre-long cable-stayed portion. The freeway should reduce congestion on the Western Express Highway and the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. The 8-lane sea link will pass through Bandra, Juhu Koliwada, Versova and Carter Road.\n\nThe project will be developed through public private partnership on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis, The cost of the project was originally estimated as in 2012. This escalated to in 2013, it is currently estimated to cost . The project is expected to be completed five years from its commencement.\n\nThe Versova-Bandra Sea Link received environmental clearance, under certain conditions, from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in January 2013.\n\nA cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure chaired by Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan cleared the project on 15 January 2014. Some observers felt that the move was an attempt to keep Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) happy prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, as this project and the Pune Ring Road project which was also approved the sub-committee, would be undertaken by the MSRDC, which was then headed by the NCP. The project had been pending for approval for the past three years. The fate of the sealink had been uncertain after Chavan said that coastal roads were less expensive to build. Chavan stated that he also favoured coastal roads because they had less environmental hurdles than a sealink. BMC officials stated that the government had not clarified the future of the coastal road project, after approving the VBSL.\n\nThe MSRDC invited request for qualification (RFQ) from companies interested in constructing the VBSL on 2 March 2014. The agency conducted a pre-bid conference for potential bidders on 28 March. The last date for the submission of technical bids was fixed as 30 May, and the MSRDC plans to open technical bids on 31 May, as per the tender notice. The MSRDC estimated that the project concession period to be 35 years in the absence of any viability gap funding (the state's financial contribution in a PPP project). However, after some members of the infrastructure sub-committee expressed reservations about the long concession period, the corporation decided to seek 20% from the Union government, which the MSRDC estimates will reduce the concession period to about 28–30 years.\n\nIn its report, submitted in January 2012, the Joint Technical Committee advised the government to build a 35.6 km coastal freeway from Manora MLA Hostel at Nariman Point to Kandivali. The project is estimated to cost 10,000 crore.\n\nCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms in India disallow reclamation of land. Construction of the coastal freeway would require a relaxation of the CRZ norms, as certain sections are proposed on reclaimed land. The change in norms can only be done through an amendment to the law by the Central Government. During a meeting between Prithviraj Chavan and Union environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan on 20 June 2013, Natarajan expressed concerns about the implications of relaxing CRZ norms, on creeks and mangroves. However, the minister stated that she would \"put the state's proposal at the next meeting [24 June 2013] of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority\". However, despite specific assurance from the minister, the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) decided not to include the coastal road plan in their next meeting's agenda.\n\nThe Coastal Freeway is a proposed alternative to the Western Freeway. The 29.2-km freeway is proposed to run along Mumbai's western coastline connecting Marine Lines in the south to Kandivli in the north. The estimated cost of the project is . In the first phase of the project, the road will connect Princess Street and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, and is expected be completed by 2019. A tunnel beginning at Chowpatty will link to Priyadarshini park, after which the coastal road will pass through the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. Work on the second phase, a sea link between Bandra and Kandivali, will begin after the completion of the first phase. A further extension of the road to Ahmedabad has also been proposed.\n\nIn 2011, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asked the MSRDC to think of building coastal roads instead of capital intensive sea links. He appointed a Joint Technical Committee, comprising experts and officials, in 2012 under the then Municipal commissioner Subodh Kumar to study the plan to build a coastal road. In its report, submitted in January 2012, the committee advised the government to build a 35.6 km coastal freeway from Manora MLA Hostel at Nariman Point to Kandivali to ease traffic congestion. The project was estimated to cost 10,000 crore and would have consisted of roads built on reclaimed land as well as stilts, bridges and tunnels. The committee was against building any more sea links and pointed out that the coastal road would help save 120 billion of public money. The 35.6 km road was proposed to begin near Manora (MLA Hostel), with entry and exit points at Jagannath Bhosale Marg, move along Marine Drive and lead into a tunnel that would go under Malabar Hill and exit on the other side of Priyadarshini Park. This stretch was proposed to be built on reclaimed portions up to Haji Ali, and then to Lala Lajpatrai Road in Worli. The coastal freeway would then be connected to the Worli arm of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link by a bridge. On the Bandra side, the coastal road skirting the fort would connect the coastal freeway up to Chimbai village, where a bridge was proposed. A road by reclamation of mangroves, further north, or a road on stilts, and an elevated road between Oshiwara and Malad was also proposed. The proposed freeway would have had 18 entry and exit points along its route. The project is estimated to cost 8,000-10,000 crore, and take 5 years to complete. Critics of the freeway opposed it due to the reclamation required and have also cited possible environmental degradation along the coast.\n\nCoastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms in India disallow reclamation of land. Construction of the coastal freeway would require a relaxation of the CRZ norms, as certain sections are proposed on reclaimed land. The change in norms can only be done through an amendment to the law by the Central Government. After discussing the project on 10 April 2013, the Maharashtra coastal zone management authority (MCZMA), the state's apex environment body, urged the Centre to amend the CRZ notification to permit \"reclamation for roads\". The MCZMA stated that reclamation should not be permitted for any other development activity and that the high tide line must not be altered. The MCZMA also argued that the ring road would serve as a protection wall from inland flooding, besides being a vital road link for decongesting traffic. During a meeting between Prithviraj Chavan and Union environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan on 20 June 2013, Natarajan expressed concerns about the implications of relaxing CRZ norms, on creeks and mangroves. However, the minister stated that she would \"put the state's proposal at the next meeting [24 June 2013] of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority\". However, despite specific assurance from the minister, the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) decided not to include the coastal road plan in their next meeting's agenda.\n\nDuring the 2014 assembly elections, the BJP promised to implement the project if elected. On 6 June 2015, the State Government signed an MoU with the Dutch Government for technical co-operation in implementing the project. The Netherlands is known for its environment-friendly reclamation and the use of the sea. On 8 June 2015, the coastal road project received clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests.\n\nInitial work on the project began on 26 November 2016. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray stated that a survey of the soil at the seabed was being undertaken. The foundation stone for the project for the coastal road project is scheduled for monsoon 2017.\n\n"}

Originally planned to be ready for Expo 2010, the controversial project was repeatedly delayed, with final approval being granted on August 18, 2008. Construction was scheduled to start in late March 2009, with the target for completion having been 2014. According to China Daily as reported in People's Daily Online on February 27, 2009, the Shanghai government was considering building the maglev line underground to allay the public's fear of electromagnetic pollution, and a final decision would need to be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission. In March 2009, the project was reported to be \"suspended\", although it had not been officially cancelled. The October 26, 2010 opening of the Shanghai–Hangzhou high-speed railway makes construction of this line unlikely.\n\nThe high-speed line would run between the two Chinese cities of Shanghai and Hangzhou. The total length would be 169 km (105 mi), of which 64 km (40 mi) would be within the City of Shanghai and 105 km (65 mi) in the province of Zhejiang. Four stations would be built: at the Expo 2010 site in east Shanghai; in south Shanghai; Jiaxing; and east Hangzhou. The proposed design speed is 450 km/h, which would allow the train to travel the 169 km total distance in just 27 minutes. The total budget of the project was to be 35 billion RMB (about US$5.0 billion as of April 2008).\n\nIf built, the line would become the first inter-city maglev rail line in commercial service in the world and also the fastest inter-city train. The line would be an extension of the only maglev line in China (and the only commercial service high-speed maglev line in the world) so far, the Shanghai maglev train at Pudong International Airport.\n\nMedia reports on 26 May 2007 said the Shanghai city government announced that the project had been suspended, citing \"radiation concerns\", despite an environmental assessment by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences saying the line was safe and that it would not affect air and water quality, and noise pollution could be controlled. An environmental assessment report released 2 January 2008, for citizens to comment on until 15 January, says the link would have minimal impact on the local environment.\n\nIn January and February 2008, hundreds of residents demonstrated in downtown Shanghai against the line being built close to their homes. The residents were reportedly concerned with potential health hazards, noise, and loss of property value. The Shanghai scheme has a buffer zone around the track that will be 22.5 m wide, which compares unfavourably with German standards that require houses to be 300 m away from the line. Representatives of the residents filed a formal request to demonstrate with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, which was rejected.\n\nIn October 2010 the Shanghai–Hangzhou high-speed railway was opened, bringing the travelling time between the two cities down to 45 minutes. An official revealed that the maglev link was to be shelved.\n\n"}

He was the Deputy Surveyor to William Light, engaged to survey the new colony of South Australia. Kingston was also the first Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly.\n\nKingston was born in Bandon, County Cork, Ireland, one of five children of George Kingston and Hester Holland. Strickland's father owned a lumberyard, a tenement (Kingston Buildings), and was credited with being involved in the three canal plans for Bandon. Strickland emigrated to England and was employed in Birmingham in 1832. He subsequently took an active part in promoting the South Australian Act in 1834 and helped to lobby successfully for its passage through the House of Commons.\n\nKingston was appointed deputy surveyor to the new province and sailed with most of the surveying party in the \"Cygnet\" in March 1836. Because he detoured to Rio de Janeiro for supplies the \"Cygnet\" did not arrive at Nepean Bay until 11 September 1836, nearly a month after Colonel William Light, who was therefore left short-handed at a critical time. However it was Donna, the thirsty South American bloodhound, who led Kingston, John Morphett and Lieutenant W.G. Field to the River Torrens. Kingston was incompetent as a Surveyor and his work on the Survey of Adelaide, between West Terrace and the Western side of King William Street was so erroneous that Light had all of Kingston's area re-surveyed by Assistant Surveyors Boyle Travers Finniss and George Ormsby.\n\nKingston's ability as a surveyor was frequently questioned and it was he who was spared to return to England in August 1837 to seek removal of Governor Hindmarsh. The colonisation commissioners sent him back next June with orders unpalatable to Light, who resigned with all but three of his staff. Kingston made many more blunders in continuing the country surveys (errors that Frome later reported requiring substantial resources to correct), and soon after Governor George Gawler's arrival in October 1838, Kingston resigned.\n\nKingston established himself as a civil engineer, architect and surveyor, and in 1840 the Adelaide Municipal Council briefly engaged him as town surveyor. He was later engaged as inspector of public works and, buildings. Among his works still standing are the south-eastern corner of Government House (1839), the original section of the Adelaide Gaol (1840), Cummins House at Camden Park (1841) and Kingston Historical House (1840, 1851). He also designed the first monument to Colonel Light in Light Square (1843). He designed White's Rooms, Adelaide's first public entertainment venue.\n\nOn 10 July 1851, Kingston was sworn in as a member of South Australia's first elected parliament and held his seat in the Legislative Council until 2 February 1857. On 9 March 1857, Kingston was elected to the newly established House of Assembly and became the first Speaker on 22 April 1857. Kingston held this position until 22 March 1860 and again from 31 March 1865 until his death on 26 November 1880. Kingston represented The Burra and Clare from 9 March 1857 to 22 March 1860 and Stanley from 6 May 1861 until his death.\n\nKingston was prominent in forming the South Australian Mining Association to keep the mineral wealth of the colony from overseas speculators. With Edward Stephens, he investigated copper finds at Burra in 1845, and then played a leading role in the 'snobs' party to defeat the 'nobs' for the mine. An original shareholder, he was appointed surveyor and architect of the mining association but it was William Jacob who carried out the Burra special survey of 20,000 acres (8094 ha). In April 1848 he was elected a director, deputy-chairman in October 1856 and chairman from 1857 until his death. In its first five years the 'monster mine' paid fifteen dividends each of 200 per cent.\n\nIn 1858 Kingston was part of the team who surveyed the namesake town of Kingston, later renamed Kingston SE as a part of a private real estate development.\n\nKingston was interested in the Volunteer movement and was once captain of the East Adelaide Rifles. He was also a founding member and later Master of The South Australian Lodge of Friendship and of the Statistical Society, keeping a valuable register of Adelaide's rainfall from 1839–1879. Kingston was also one of the founding members of the Freemasons South Australian Lodge of Friendship No. 613 (under a Warrant or Charter of Constitution which was issued at Adelphi, London, England on 22 October 1834). The original Lodge to which Kingston belonged was Irish Lodge No 81. Kingston was the first Senior Warden of the new South Australian Lodge and on 14 August 1838, Kingston was elected Master. He was a member of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society and its president from 1859 to 1860.\n\nKingston was knighted in 1870. He died in 1880 aboard the \"RMS Malwa\" on his way to India and was buried at sea.\n\nKingston married three times, being widowed in his first two marriages. He married his first wife Henrietta Ann McDonough in 1829; she died ten years later and their only child died soon after childbirth. Six children were born to his second wife, Ludovina Catherina da Silva Cameron (daughter of soldier Charles Cameron (1779–1827)), after their marriage on 10 April 1841. She died ten years later and Kingston married widow Emma Lipson (1816–1876), daughter of Thomas Lipson R.N., South Australia's first harbourmaster, on 4 December 1856 (no children resulted from this marriage).\n\nKingston's name has been applied to the following places in South Australia - Hundred of Kingston, Mount Kingston near Lake Eyre, Kingston Park (a suburb of Adelaide) and the township of Kingston SE. The township of Kingston-on-Murray was named after his son, Sir Charles Cameron Kingston.\n\n\n"}

Which a goal scored against NAC Breda, was the first Ajax goal in the new stadium, the Johan Cruyff Arena. He subsequently signed on for Girondins Bordeaux in 1997 to further his experience in the hope to be selected for the Dutch national team competing in the 1998 FIFA World Cup although he was overlooked by then coach Guus Hiddink.\n\nAfter spending two seasons at the French club, he decided to move on to Spanish club Málaga CF where he played 94 games and scored a total of 22 goals in four seasons. In 2003, he was transferred to Atlético Madrid for €3 million on a five-year contract, a year before his Málaga contract was due to expire, in what he viewed as a potentially good career move. In his first season with the club, he played 26 matches and scored two goals although in the following season, he was relegated to the substitutes' bench and only scraped together eight games in 2004.\n\nIn January 2005, Musampa moved to Manchester City of the Premier League on loan after becoming a fringe player at Atlético. In his first six months, he scored three goals in 14 games; his first City goal was a \"spectacular volley\" in the last-minute which was the winner against Liverpool and gave Stuart Pearce his first win as City manager, while he also scored goals against Aston Villa in a 2-1 victory, and an equaliser against Middlesbrough which wasn't enough to help City qualify for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn June 2005 Musampa agreed up to stay at Manchester City for a second season. The Dutchman started the new season as a regular first team player, but lost his first team place in December, after which he played irregularly, with the majority of his appearances being in central midfield.

After returning to the Netherlands, Musampa trained with Eredivisie outfit AZ. In November 2007, he signed a contract at the club for the rest of the season, but he was released from his contract on 1 January 2008.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful trial with Toronto FC of Major League Soccer he signed a two-year contract with K-League side FC Seoul in March 2008. His stay in South Korea was brief, as he made just three league appearances and two League Cup appearances for the club before the two parties agreed to mutually terminate his contract in June 2008.\n\nOn 14 March 2009, Musampa returned to professional football signing for Willem II Tilburg in the Netherlands.\n\nIn September 2009 the winger went on trial with French side FC Metz, scored one goal in a friendly match, but the club did not sign him in the end.\n\nHe eventually announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nMusampa was the member of Dutch U20 team at 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship, playing all three group matches, the team did not proceed past the group stage. Musampa went on to be a key player for the Netherlands Under-21s and achieved 25 caps, scoring 8 goals, he is currently in the top 10 players for both caps and goals at that level.

The method is named after Walther Ritz.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a system of particles can be described in terms of an \"energy functional\" or Hamiltonian, which will measure the energy of any proposed configuration of said particles. It turns out that certain privileged configurations are more likely than other configurations, and this has to do with the eigenanalysis (\"analysis of characteristics\") of this Hamiltonian system. Because it is often impossible to analyze all of the infinite configurations of particles to find the one with the least amount of energy, it becomes essential to be able to approximate this Hamiltonian in some way for the purpose of numerical computations.\n\nThe Ritz method can be used to achieve this goal. In the language of mathematics, it is exactly the finite element method used to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian system.\n\nAs with other variational methods, a trial wave function, formula_1, is tested on the system. This trial function is selected to meet boundary conditions (and any other physical constraints). The exact function is not known; the trial function contains one or more adjustable parameters, which are varied to find a lowest energy configuration.\n\nIt can be shown that the ground state energy, formula_2, satisfies an inequality:\n\nThat is, the ground-state energy is less than this value.\nThe trial wave-function will always give an expectation value larger than or equal to the ground-energy.\n\nIf the trial wave function is known to be orthogonal to the ground state, then it will provide a boundary for the energy of some excited state.\n\nThe Ritz ansatz function is a linear combination of \"N\" known basis functions formula_4, parametrized by unknown coefficients:\n\nWith a known Hamiltonian, we can write its expected value as\n\nThe basis functions are usually not orthogonal, so that the overlap matrix S has nonzero nondiagonal elements. Either formula_7 or formula_8 (the conjugation of the first) can be used to minimize the expectation value. For instance, by making the partial derivatives of formula_9 over formula_8 zero, the following equality is obtained for every \"k\" = 1, 2, ..., \"N\":\n\nwhich leads to a set of \"N\" secular equations:\n\nIn the above equations, energy formula_9 and the coefficients formula_14 are unknown. With respect to c, this is a homogeneous set of linear equations, which has a solution when the determinant of the coefficients to these unknowns is zero:\n\nwhich in turn is true only for \"N\" values of formula_9. Furthermore, since the Hamiltonian is a hermitian operator, the H matrix is also hermitian and the values of formula_17 will be real. The lowest value among formula_17 (i=1,2..,N), formula_19, will be the best approximation to the ground state for the basis functions used. The remaining \"N-1\" energies are estimates of excited state energies. An approximation for the wave function of state \"i\" can be obtained by finding the coefficients formula_14 from the corresponding secular equation.\n\nIn the language of the finite element method, the matrix formula_21 is precisely the \"stiffness matrix\" of the Hamiltonian in the piecewise linear element space, and the matrix formula_22 is the \"mass matrix\". In the language of linear algebra, the value formula_23 is an eigenvalue of the discretized Hamiltonian, and the vector formula_24 is a discretized eigenvector.\n\n\n\n"}

His best known novels are \"Nowhere Man\" (2002) and \"The Lazarus Project\" (2008).\n\nHe frequently publishes in \"The New Yorker\", and has also written for \"Esquire\", \"The Paris Review\", the Op-Ed page of \"The New York Times\", and the Sarajevo magazine \"BH Dani\".\n\nHemon was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then Yugoslavia, to a father of partial Ukrainian descent and a Bosnian Serb mother. Hemon's great-grandfather, Teodor Hemon, came to Bosnia from Western Ukraine prior to World War I, when both countries were a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nHemon graduated from the University of Sarajevo and was a published writer in former Yugoslavia by the time he was 26.\n\nSince 1992 he has lived in the United States, where he found himself as a tourist and became stranded at the outbreak of the war in Bosnia. In the U.S. he worked as a Greenpeace canvasser, sandwich assembly-line worker, bike messenger, graduate student in English literature, bookstore salesperson, and ESL teacher.\n\nHe is the winner of a MacArthur Foundation grant.\n\nHe published his first story in English, \"The Life and Work of Alphonse Kauders\" in \"Triquarterly\" in 1995, followed by \"The Sorge Spy Ring,\" also in \"Triquarterly\" in 1996, \"A Coin\" in \"Chicago Review\" in 1997, \"Islands\" in \"Ploughshares\" in 1998, and eventually \"Blind Jozef Pronek\" in The New Yorker in 1999. His work also eventually appeared in \"Esquire\", \"The Paris Review\", \"Best American Short Stories,\" and elsewhere. Hemon also has a bi-weekly column, written and published in Bosnian, called \"Hemonwood\" in the Sarajevo-based magazine, \"BH Dani\" (\"BH Days\").\n\nHemon is currently a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, where he lives with his second wife, Teri Boyd, and their daughters Ella and Esther. The couple's second child, 1-year-old daughter Isabel, died of complications associated with a brain tumor in November 2010. Hemon published an essay, \"The Aquarium,\" about Isabel's death in the June 13/20, 2011 issue of \"The New Yorker\".\n\nIn 2000 Hemon published his first book, \"The Question of Bruno\", which included short stories and a novella, to overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\nHis second book, \"Nowhere Man\", followed in 2002. Variously referred to as a novel and as a collection of linked stories, \"Nowhere Man\" concerns Jozef Pronek, a character who earlier appeared in one of the stories in \"The Question of Bruno\". It was a finalist for the 2002 National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nIn June 2006, \"\"Exchange of Pleasant Words\" and \"A Coin\"\" was published by Picador.\n\nOn 1 May 2008, Hemon released \"The Lazarus Project\", inspired by the story of Lazarus Averbuch, which featured photographs by Hemon's childhood friend, photographer Velibor Božović. The novel was a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award, the 2008 National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named as a \"New York Times Notable Book\" and New York magazine's No. 1 Book of the Year.\n\nIn May 2009, Hemon released a collection of stories, \"Love and Obstacles,\" which were largely written at the same time as he wrote \"The Lazarus Project.\"\n\nIn 2011, Hemon was awarded the PEN/W.G. Sebald Award chosen by the judges Jill Ciment, Salvatore Scibona, and Gary Shteyngart.\n\nHemon's first nonfiction book, \"The Book of My Lives,\" was released in 2013.\n\nHemon's novel \"The Making of Zombie Wars\" was released in 2015.\n\nHe published his second work of non-fiction, \"My Parents: An Introduction,\" in 2019.\n\nOn August 20th, 2019, it was announced that his script for the fourth \"Matrix\" film (co-authored with David Mitchell and series creator Lana Wachowski) would be produced in early 2020.\n\nIn October 2019, Hemon joined intellectuals in an international public outcry, in response to decision of the Nobel Committee to award Peter Handke a Nobel Prize in literature earlier that month. He wrote a piece in \"The New York Times\" for their \"Opinion\" column, published in October 15th issue, in which Aleksandar criticized committee for the decision.\n\nAs an accomplished fiction writer who learned English as an adult, Hemon has some similarities to Joseph Conrad, which he acknowledges through allusion in \"The Question of Bruno\", though he is most frequently compared to Vladimir Nabokov. All of his stories deal in some way with the Yugoslav Wars, Bosnia, or Chicago, but they vary substantially in genre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released as a 12-inch single in July 2002, through DFA Records. It was later featured on the CD version of their eponymous debut studio album. \"Losing My Edge\" peaked at number 115 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also listed at number 13 on \"Pitchfork\"s Top 500 Songs of the 2000s list. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 40 on its \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\" list. In June 2018, \"Rolling Stone\" listed it at number 77 on its \"The 100 Greatest Songs of the Century – So Far\" list.\n\nIn an interview with the music site \"ireallylovemusic\", James Murphy (the leader of the group) explained his inspiration for the song:\n\nIn another interview, Murphy elaborated further on the birth and the release of the song:So I started going to different types of things and meeting different people, and started throwing parties. And all of a sudden, I was kind of cool, I'd always just been a total... not even an outsider, just sort of a nobody, a sort of invisible, sad and kind of shy. And all of a sudden I was DJing, and felt cool, throwing parties. And then one night I went to go see a band, and somebody else was playing the records that I was playing. Nobody else was playing the records that I was playing, that was sort of my thing! And I got really mad, and I got really defensive. And I was like 'What the heck, that's mine! What the--who the hell is this? Some 22-year-old...', and I got really embarassed [sic] by being like 'These aren't your records, you didn't write them, you just... play them, you just own them, you can't be proud of yourself for owning them' but I was mad at the same time because I was like 'I know that kid was at one of my parties...'. It was this really dense conflict that I couldn't resolve, and that's where 'Losing My Edge' came from. I didn't have a good answer. I was angry, but I was also pathetic for being angry. There wasn't really a right or wrong, you know? I was right and wrong, and this kid was right and wrong, and everybody there was right and wrong. It felt really dense, and really easy to write from. Easy to make something from.So I made that song, and everybody thought it was terrible. I remember playing it to people, and they'd give you this face (makes a face of surprise and doubt), you know, when they don't want to say anything! And they'd ask me about technical stuff like 'Oh, what are the drums?' and I was like 'OK, you don't like this'. And Phil Mossman, who was the original LCD guitar player, was the only person that was like 'I love this, I really love this, it's very funny'. So we put it out, and the people from the label, my two partners Tim and Jonathan afterwards said 'We just thought you were making a big mistake, you're gonna look like an idiot, and we just feel bad for you'. It was the B-side to 'Beat Connection' until the last minute. I thought 'No, that should be the A-side, that should be the one I should sink or swim with.'\n\n\"Losing My Edge\" is a dance-punk and alternative dance song. It features a rhythm similar to \"Change\" by Killing Joke. The track mentions the following artists, genres and music venues: acid house, Can, Suicide, Captain Beefheart, Daft Punk, CBGB, Paradise Garage, Larry Levan, The Peech Boys, Modern Lovers, Niagara, Detroit techno, Yaz, and ends with \"But have you seen my records?\" and a list of the following: This Heat, Pere Ubu, Outsiders, Nation of Ulysses, Mars, Trojans, Black Dice (referred to as 'The Black Dice'), Todd Terry, the Germs, Section 25, Althea & Donna, Sexual Harassment, a-ha, Dorothy Ashby, PIL, The Fania All-Stars, The Bar-Kays, The Human League, The Normal, Lou Reed, Scott Walker, Monks, Niagara, Joy Division, Laurent Garnier, The Creation, Sun Ra, Scientists, Royal Trux, 10cc, Rammelzee, Eric B. and Rakim, The Index, Basic Channel, Soulsonic Force (\"Just hit me!\"), Juan Atkins, Manuel Göttsching, David Axelrod, Electric Prunes, Gil Scott-Heron, The Slits, Faust, Mantronix, Pharoah Sanders, The Fire Engines, Swans (referred to as 'The Swans'), Soft Cell (referred to as 'The Soft Cell') and The Sonics (repeated four times).\n\n\nPersonnel adapted from the liner notes of the single's Record Store Day 2012 release.\n\n"}

Based in Anacortes, Washington, in the mid-2000s he began to spell his surname Elvrum as \"Elverum.\"\n\nPhil Elverum was born on May 23, 1978, in Anacortes, Washington. Growing up Elverum's father regularly made mixtapes for him and his sister. He soon started to play the tuba but after three years moved onto drums. At age 14, he started his own band \"Nubert Circus\", playing the drums and writing lyrics. Elverum attended Anacortes High School. After graduating, he traveled across Canada with his then-girlfriend. In the summer of 1997, he moved to Olympia, Washington where he lived from until 2002. Elverum briefly attended Evergreen State College.\n\nIn his adolescence, Elverum worked at Anacortes based record store The Business where he would record music in the backroom, after hours. During his time there, he met Beat Happening member Bret Lunsford who offered him a job as the drummer of the band D+ alongside Karl Blau.\n\nElverum is best known for having recorded and performed prolifically under the band names The Microphones (1996–2003) and Mount Eerie (2003–present). Elverum uses mostly analog recording equipment and often works in his own studio spaces, where he has the time and freedom to experiment with sounds. In 2012, he helped establish a studio and venue called \"The Unknown\" at a disused church in his hometown of Anacortes, Washington.\n\nIn 2004, Elverum created the label P. W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., through which he has released records by Mount Eerie and The Microphones, as well as The Spectacle, Thanksgiving, Woelv, , Key Losers and Wyrd Visions. Prior to this, he was closely linked to K Records and the Olympia, Washington music scene, where he produced recordings by Mirah, Little Wings, Beat Happening, The Blow, and others at Dub Narcotic Studio.\n\nHis musical influences include Eric's Trip, Will Oldham, Björk, Nirvana, Popol Vuh, Sunn O))), and Angelo Badalamenti.\n\nOn the topic of his musical style, Elverum has said: \"You can easily find out what my music sounds like. I will not try to describe it\". He has however described the aesthetics of his music as attempt to replicate \"a dark presence in nature\" found in shows such as \"Twin Peaks\". Elverum's music incorporates elements of ambient, folk, and black metal. His lyrics have been described as \"confessional\", \"sparse\", \"tersely poetic\" and \"conversational\", singing \"speak-sing\" and his storytelling \"free-flowing.\"\n\n\"The Believer Magazine\" described his work as \"delicately sparse or layered and noisy, often in the same song. Lyrically, he focuses on memory, first-person storytelling, myth, naturalism, the everyday as sacred, and sense of place (in and out of Washington State)\".\n\nHis style has been praised for its personal and grounded nature. Rachel Laitman wrote: \"The effectiveness of Elverum’s style reminds us about the injury, and profound misunderstanding, incurred when we put the form of expression called singing in a box.\"\n\nElverum is also known for his artwork and photography. Early in his career, he produced limited-run fanzines and song booklets which would be sold during Microphones tours. Since establishing P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., he began to experiment with letterpress printing and other elaborate packaging ideas for his releases. In 2007, he published a hardcover book of film photography with a 10\" picture disc titled \"Mount Eerie pts. 6 & 7\". In 2009 Elverum hosted his first art show, \"In Dreams,\" at Stumptown Coffee, Portland. The exhibition consited of landscapes Elverum photographed in Norway, France, and rural Washington, using antique cameras and expired film. In 2014 Elverum released \"Dust\", a book of digital photography bound in stamped linen. He sells large scale photographic prints and ink paintings through his online store. in 2017 after finishing his eighth studio album, Elverum created a book about Anacortes, Washington.\n\nIn 2005, Elverum created a 365-day comic calendar titled \"Fancy People Adventures\", which was later syndicated by music website Tiny Mix Tapes. In late 2008, Buenaventura Press published \"Dawn\", a book and CD of journal entries and songs from winter 2002/03, during which Elverum lived in a remote cabin in Finnkonevika, Kjerringøy, Norway. \n\nIn 2001, while on tour, Elverum wrote a, \"paper opera\", play entitled The Other Foot In The Other World show as part of a magazine centering around the theme of death.\n\nElverum has also experimented with filmmaking, producing background visuals for his shows (released as a limited edition DVD entitled \"Fog Movies\") and promotional videos for several Mount Eerie songs.\n\nElverum married Canadian artist and musician Geneviève Castrée on February 29, 2004. Castrée was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer following the birth of the couple's first child in 2015 and died on July 9, 2016.\n\nHe married actress Michelle Williams in July 2018 in a private ceremony in the Adirondacks. Around the same time, Elverum moved from his longtime residence in Anacortes to Williams' home in Brooklyn. The couple separated in January 2019, and filed for divorce in April 2019. Following the split, Elverum moved back to Washington state, after having lived in New York for about nine months. By November 2019, it was reported that they were no longer married.\n\nElverum described his parents as \"mystical about nature\", although these beliefs were not tied to a specific religion. In an interview from 2012, he stated that \"a lot of the ideas that I’m trying to enunciate reflect a more or less Buddhist ideology. Even though I’m not Buddhist, at all, I come across these same ideas... I’m taking things from that tradition and reframing them in my world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pronek's biography is related by multiple narrators. The book can be divided into three sections. The first section describes Pronek's peaceful childhood in 1980s Sarajevo. The second section follows Pronek as he is a university student in Kiev in the Soviet Union at the time of the 1991 political turmoil (narrated by his dormitory roommate Victor Plavchuk). In the third part of the book Pronek is an immigrant in Chicago, where he works in a series of low-paid jobs including working as a Greenpeace canvasser, which enables him to observe the lives of middle-class Chicagoans. Some of these elements are reflective of the author's own life.\n\nThe novel's final chapter, spanning the years 1900 to 2000, is a departure from Pronek's adventures and recounts the story of a Russian White Army officer and his adventures in Harbin and Shanghai.\n\n"}

{"id": "1990139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990139", "title": "MAS-36 rifle", "text": "MAS-36 rifle\n\nThe MAS Modèle 36 (also known as the \"Fusil à répétition 7 mm 5 M. 36\") is a military bolt-action rifle. First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the Berthier and Lebel series of service rifles, it saw service long past the World War II period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French infantry during the Battle of France in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.\n\nThe MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless 7.5×54mm French cartridge; a shortened version of the 7.5×57mm MAS mod. 1924 cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's FM 24/29 light machine gun. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British SMLE rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the \"dog leg\" shaped bolt handle of the British P14/U.S. M1917 Enfield rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and peep sight, and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German Gewehr 98 which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round stripper clips), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.\n\nThere are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.\n\nThe MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles. The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual safety.\n\nThe rifle was designed with an iron sight line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5×54mm French mle1929 C ammunition for in increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.\nThere were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally in 2.32 MOA increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim left or right or up or down at a range of .\nIt is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.\n\nIt was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap. Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.\n\nThe MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard semi-automatic rifle before the next big conflict. The first French semi-automatic rifle evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The Battle of France and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic MAS-49 rifle as their standard service rifle.\n\nThough intended to replace the Lebel Model 1886 and Berthier rifles as well as Berthier carbines, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units. During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the Battle of France, the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation \"Gewehr 242(f)\" and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the Volkssturm.\n\nPost World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced glare under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature phosphating/Parkerizing introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.\n\nThe MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the First Indochina War and the Algerian War, as well as in the Suez Crisis. During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the \"2ème RPC\" (\"Régiment de Parachutistes Coloniaux\"), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers. The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units. It was officially a substitute-standard rifle after France adopted the semi-automatic MAS-49 rifle series in 1949, though its bolt design lives on in a dedicated sniper version of the rifle, the FR F1 (now chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO) and its successor the FR F2 sniper rifle.\n\nGabon and Côte d'Ivoire continued to use the MAS-36 post independence; In 1968 and 1969 they supplied Biafra with MAS-36 rifles during the Nigerian Civil War. Haiti presented Biafra with 300 rifles as a gift late in the conflict.\n\nAfter the Second World War, civilian hunting rifle versions were made by MAS and by the gunsmith Jean Fournier. These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the 7×54mm Fournier (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), 7×57mm Mauser (very rare), 8×60mm S (less common), and 10.75×68mm (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62×51mm NATO from 7.5×54mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an SKS type trigger safety fitted to them.\n\nIn Comoros, the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the Post-war era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new Comoros Army. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer assault weapons such as the AK-47.\n\nIn 1941, Britain and Free France occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the Syrian Armed Forces in order to arm their own army and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the Soviet Union instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the Syrian Civil War, Syrian opposition forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the Free Syrian Army widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.\n\nThe French FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle.

Guardi was one of the founders of the Venetian Academy in 1756.\n\nHe was born in Vienna into a family of nobility from Trentino. His father Domenico (born in 1678) was a Baroque painter. Gianantonio and his brothers Niccolò and Francesco (also painters), later inherited the family workshop after their father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to his brother Francesco Guardi. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.\n\nHe may have received his artistic training in Vienna, where he is first recorded in 1719, but had established a workshop in Venice by 1730. Among his first important clients was the connoisseur and collector Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, for whom Guardi created numerous paintings with an Orientalist theme.\n\nHe produced copies after the work of other artists, as well as a series of originals with Turkish-inspired interiors as easel pictures for private decorations. Antonio Guardi trained his younger brothers Nicolò and Francesco in his workshop, the latter working closely with him as a figure painter before establishing himself as a vedutista in the late 1750s.\n\nA founder member of the Accademia Veneziana in 1756, the elder Guardi produced several works for churches in Venice, notably in the Church of the Angelo San Raffaele, as well as decorative cycles for palaces and villas in the city and the surrounding countryside. Francesco Casanova was among his pupils.\n\nHe died in Venice in 1760.\n\n"}

The Nā Pali coast itself extends southwest starting at Kee Beach extending all the way to Polihale State Park. The \"na pali\" (high cliffs) along the shoreline rise as much as above the Pacific Ocean. The state park was formed to protect the Kalalau Valley.\n\nTo the east of the state park is the Hono O Nā Pali State Natural Reserve. It was established in 1983, and then extended to over in 2009. Hiking trails and hunters roads have access to the sharp ridges from Koke'e Road (route 550) in Waimea Canyon.\n\nAlthough inaccessible to vehicles, this coast can be enjoyed over land by hiking or in a helicopter, and from the ocean by kayak and paddleboard. Charter tours are available on rigid-hulled inflatable boat or catamaran, originating from Port Allen and Hanalei Bay. The Kalalau Trail from the end of Hawaii Route 56 (called the Kuhio Highway) provides the only land access along the coast, traversing and crossing five major valleys (and many smaller ones) before reaching Kalalau Beach at the base of Kalalau Valley. Side trails along the way lead to waterfalls in the valleys above.\n\nThe first settlers on the Nā Pali Coast were Polynesian navigators around 1200 AD. Soon after, many Tahitian migrants followed, shaping the culture of Kauai and other Hawaiian islands today. The coast was a center for trade between Hanalei, Waimea and Ni`ihau, and branched out to nearby island colonies. After Kauai was visited by Captain Cook in 1778, many Westerners began traveling to the island. As more foreigners arrived, the Hawaiian tribes along the Nā Pali Coast, where Nā Pali Coast State Park now exists, began to die off from Western diseases. The last known native Hawaiians to live along the Nā Pali Coast were sighted in the 20th century.\n\nCamping in Nā Pali Coast State Park is only allowed with a valid permit. There are three sites that allow camping access. During the summer season from May 15 to September 7, access from the ocean via boat or kayak is only allowed with a valid camping permit. Along the Kalalau Trail, the two authorized spots for camping are in Kalalau and Hanakoa . Both are covered by the same permit and can be accessed by hiking. These locations include facilities to accommodate campers. Five nights is the maximum stay on the Kalalau Trail, and one night maximum for Hanakoa. The camp site at Miloli'i is only accessible by boat or kayak. Permits allow access for maximum of three days. Composting toilets are available at all three camp sites.\n\n\n"}

Most people associate a mainframe with a large computer, but mainframes are getting smaller all the time. The terms \"mainframe\" and \"enterprise server\" are converging. Supercomputers are generally used for their speed and complexity, while mainframes are used for storing large volumes of sensitive data. Mainframes are typically the most secure, efficient, and cost-effective computing option for organizations dealing with transactions on a large, enterprise-level scale.\n\nOrganizations in different industries have different auditing and security requirements. Some factors affecting the organizations' requirements are: regulatory requirements and other external factors; management, objectives, and business practices; and the organizations' performance compared to the industry. This information can be obtained by conducting outside research, interviewing employees, touring the data center and observing activities, consultations with technical experts, and looking at company manuals and business plans.\n\nAnother consideration is the level of mainframe access employees have and if password policies are in place and followed. Evidence of implementation can be obtained by requesting employee manuals, evaluating the software and user histories, and by physical observation of the environment. (Gallegos, 2004).\n\nPhysical access is also an area of interest. Are cables adequately protected from damage and sniffing between the Network and the Data Center? This can be achieved by proper routing of the cables, encryption, and a good network topology. Physical observation of where the cables are routed and confirmation of the security procedures should be obtained. Tests of controls should be conducted to determine any additional weaknesses.\n\nDoes the mainframe have access to an adequate uninterruptible power supply? Are physical controls such as power badges for access, fire suppression devices, and locks in place to protect the data center (and the mainframe inside) from theft, manipulation or damage? Physical observation is necessary to ensure these requirements.\n\n\n\n\nAfter performing the necessary tests and procedures, determine whether the evidence obtained is sufficient to come to a conclusion and recommendation.\n\nMainframes, despite their reliability, possess so much data that precautions need to be taken to protect the information they hold and the integrity of the system. Security is maintained with the following techniques:\n\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of these internal controls an auditor should do outside research, physically observe controls as needed, test the controls, perform substantive tests, and employ computer assisted audit techniques when prudent.\n\n\n"}

Fearghail's grandfather Angall had previously established control over \"Annaly (Anghaile)\".\nAll variants of the Farrell name are Anglicized forms of the Gaelic name Fearghail (fear = man, ghal = valor). The O-prefix, meaning the grandsons or descendants of Fearghail (source: \"A Dictionary of Surnames\". Oxford, 1994.) The O'Farrell surname is abundant in the present-day midland counties of Ireland, especially in County Longford, where it is second in number only to O'Reilly.\n\nThe surname O'Farrelly is a variant derived from the old genitive form Ó Fearghaile. They were an erenagh clan of Bréifne, and featured a number of distinguished medieval churchmen, including David Ó Faircheallaigh (bishop of Kilmore from c. 1408, and the poet Feardorcha O'Farrelly.\n\nFerghail's descendants took the surname \"Ó Fearghail\", indicating their heritage. These descendants became princes of the territory of Annaly, which corresponds roughly to present-day County Longford. Their chieftain sat at O'Farrell's stronghold (Irish orthography: \"Longphort Uí Fhearghail\"), located in the present day town of Longford. The clan is also associated with Moatfarrell (Irish orthography: \"Móta Uí Fhearghail\") in the eastern part of Annaly. Presently, this lies between the towns of Ballinalee and Edgeworthstown.\n\nFrom the early 11th century until the colonial confiscations of James I in the early 17th century, the Farrell clan maintained control over the Annaly region. This rule was disrupted by repeated English invasions in the 12th and 13th centuries. By the 15th century, the clan regained complete control and had divided into the North Annaly ruling White O'Farrell (Irish orthography: \"Uí Fhearghail Bán\") and the South Annaly ruling Yellow O'Farrell (Irish orthography: \"Uí Fhearghail Buí\"). After the Clan-based Gaelic Order had been shattered, many members of the clan became tenants of their old land with English and Scottish landlords.\n\nMembers of the O'Farrell clan had served in an Irish regiment of the Spanish Army in the Eighty Years' War in the 1580s. Although originally intending to fight on the English side for Elizabeth I in support of the Dutch United Provinces, religious factors and better pay offered by the Spaniards resulted in their changing sides. By the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, many troops returned to fight with the Irish Catholic movement of confederate Ireland. After the Confederates were defeated many of the Irish soldiers returned to Spain. Some of these later defected to French armies seeking better conditions. By the end of the 17th century, the Farrell clan had mostly returned to Ireland.\n\nThe motto of the Farrell clan was \"Prodesse Non Nocere\" (Do good, not evil).\n\neadagh O’Ferrall of Annaly, Longford was killed at the Battle of the Boyne, Meath. Cheadaigh's three sons were recorded as fleeing to fight in French Brigades, with some settling in Picardy, France.\n\nVariants of the name Farrell include:\n\n\n"}

It is a sequel to Williams' 1982 game \"Joust\". Like its predecessor, \"Joust 2\" is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. \"Joust 2\" features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.\n\nJohn Newcomer led development again, which began to create a kit allowing arcade owners to convert an existing cabinet into another game. The original \"Joust\" used a horizontal monitor, but Williams chose a vertically oriented screen for the kit as a result of the design's popularity at the time.\n\nReleased during the waning days of the golden age of arcade games, \"Joust 2\" did not achieve the success that \"Joust\" reached. The game was not ported to contemporary home systems, but was later released as part of arcade game compilations.\n\n \n\n\"Joust 2\" is a 2D combat game taking place in the air and on landing platforms, like its predecessor. The player controls a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich and navigates the game world with a two-way joystick and a button. The joystick controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a wave, a more challenging one will begin.\n\nPlayers navigate the knight to collide with enemies. If the protagonist's jousting lance is higher than that of the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. \"Joust 2\" introduced a transformation ability that morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while on ground but poor flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies. \"Joust 2\" also introduced additional gameplay elements such as eggs landing in the lava spawn larger Shadow Lords flying on scorpion tail buzzards, Crystal Bats (hatching from crystals embedded in the ledges), a Gold Egg that opens a quickly changing random event box when collected (requiring the player to contact the red button on the random event box before time runs out and it disappears), and buy-in to continue preserves the current score. Certain game events also have voice synthesis (such as \"Let the jousting begin\", at the start of the game, \"Be careful warrior\" when a player has one life left, and \"Wish to continue?\" when all lives are lost and the continue countdown starts).\n\nThe game allows its player(s) to \"Choose Thy Skill Level\" at the opening; in other words, the player(s) can select a stage to begin on. These levels range, from lowest to highest: Serf (Stage 1), Page (6), Squire (11), Knight (16), Lord (21), King (26).\n\n\"Joust 2\" was developed by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, \"Joust 2\" was programmed in assembly language. Williams' video game department had shrunk following a decline in the video game industry. The company wanted to sell an arcade conversion kit for games that use a vertically oriented monitor, which had become popular at the time. Management felt that a sequel would improve the kit's saleability. The company decided to release a sequel to either \"\" or \"Joust\", ultimately choosing the latter. Technology had progressed since the original's release, providing more flexibility than before. As a result, Newcomer conceived new elements: additional characters, improved audio-visuals, and new mechanics. To portray a progression of villains, the staff added a new enemy, Knight Lord. The developers added backgrounds to the levels, inspired by artwork by M. C. Escher, Newcomer's favorite artist. Staff added a transform button to provide players with more variety and balance the gameplay.\n\nWilliams shipped around 1,000 units of \"Joust 2\", significantly fewer than its predecessor. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of \"Retro Gamer\" attributed the poor numbers to an industry slump in the mid-1980s. \"Joust 2\" arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare among collectors. Weiss negatively compared the game to its predecessor, calling \"Joust\" more popular and enjoyable. However, he commented that \"Joust 2\"s graphics are more detailed and robust.\n\nIn retrospect, Newcomer expressed dissatisfaction with the game's design, specifically the monitor's orientation. He commented that the gameplay works best with a horizontal orientation or with multi-directional scrolling. The vertical orientation proved to be a hindrance for home conversion.\n\nWhile \"Joust\" was widely ported to home systems, \"Joust 2\" was only made available as part of emulated collections. In 1997, it was released as part of \"Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2\". \"Joust 2\" was also included in the 2003 and 2012 multi-platform compilations \"Midway Arcade Treasures\" and \"Midway Arcade Origins\", respectively. It also appeared in 2016's Lego Dimensions. \n"}

It fires the French 7.5×54mm round which is equivalent in ballistics and striking power to the later 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) and 7.62×54mmR round. A robust and reliable weapon partly derived from the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) action, the FM 1924 M29 soldiered on, practically without interruptions, for more than 50 years.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, the French Army sought to replace the problematic \"Fusil-mitrailleur mle 1915 CSRG\" light machine rifle (better known as the Chauchat). French commanders considered standardizing on the American Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), but eventually required the development of a locally built weapon. MAS (an abbreviation of Manufacture d'Armes de St. Etienne - one of several government-owned arms factories in France) proposed a direct derivative of the BAR, but the Manufacture d'Armes de Châtellerault (MAC) won the bid with its weapon, which was partly derived from the BAR action. It had been formulated and designed by a Lieutenant Colonel Reibel assisted by Chief Armorer Chosse.\n\nThe FM Mle 1924 entered production in late July 1925 and saw first operational use in Morocco in May 1926. It was immediately well-received and even favorably compared in performance with the much heavier Hotchkiss machine gun. However, problems created by the new 7.5mm ammunition did appear. In particular, 8×57mm Mauser ammunition which was used in captured Mauser rifles carried by auxiliaries in Morocco during the Rif War from 1920–26, could be chambered and fired with disastrous results. This situation led to the development of a slightly shorter 7.5×54mm round, which was retained in 1929 as the standard ammunition for all future rifles and light machine guns in French service. The modified \"fusil-mitrailleur modèle 1924 modifié 1929\" (FM Mle 1924 M29) was mass-manufactured (187,412), beginning in 1930. In addition to these newly manufactured guns some 45,530 older FM Mle 1924s, already in service after phasing out the notoriously unreliable Chauchat, were rebarreled in order to accept the newer 7.5×54mm ammunition.\n\nBoth the original \"fusil-mitrailleur Mle 1924\" (\"automatic rifle, model of 1924\") as well as the modified Mle 1924 M29 have the same overall features: a folding bipod, an in-line stock, a pistol grip, a top-mounted 25-round detachable magazine and a bolt hold-open after the magazine's last round had been fired. There are two separate triggers: the trigger in front for using semi-automatic fire only and the rear trigger for firing on full automatic. Protection of all the openings against mud and dust proved excellent. The cyclic rate was controlled at 450 rounds per minute, thus allowing more continuous firing without overheating. In general, this new weapon was accurate and highly reliable but the barrel was screwed well into the receiver, as in the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and thus it could not be separated quickly and easily in the field as for the British Bren gun. The French Army instruction manual (July 1925) recommends not to go beyond 400 rounds of uninterrupted firing since at that point the gun needs to be given a pause of ten to fifteen minutes in order to cool off. But instead, the French instruction manual recommends the following routine for the FM 1924 : fire 4 to 5 detachable magazines (100 to 125 rounds), take a short pause, then keep repeating that same restrained fire plus short pause routine which permits steady performance and very extensive firing periods.\n\nThe FM 24/29 was the standard squad-level automatic weapon of the French infantry and cavalry at the start of World War II. After the French surrender in World War II, the Germans captured large quantities of this weapon, which they used operationally until the end of the war.\n\nFrom 1943 on, as the French army was re-equipped and reorganized in North Africa with Allied support, the FM 24/29 was kept in service, as French troops considered it superior to the Browning Automatic Rifle.\n\nThe FM 24/29 was the workhorse in the First Indochina War and served in the armed forces until after the end of the war in Algeria. It was replaced by the AA-52 general-purpose machine gun in the 1960s, but it was still in use with National Gendarmerie regional brigades until 2000-2006.\n\nThe Model 1924/1929D machine gun was a variant of the MAC 24/29, adapted to firing from interior firing ports in the bunkers of the Maginot Line.\n\nA derivative of the gun, the \"MAC Modèle 1931\", with a heavier barrel and 150-round side-mounted pan magazine, was produced as a heavy machine gun for installation in tanks and fortified emplacements, particularly the Maginot Line.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are a subset of an enterprise's internal control. IT control objectives relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and the overall management of the IT function of the business enterprise. IT controls are often described in two categories: IT general controls (ITGC) and IT application controls. ITGC include controls over the Information Technology (IT) environment, computer operations, access to programs and data, program development and program changes. IT application controls refer to transaction processing controls, sometimes called \"input-processing-output\" controls. Information technology controls have been given increased prominence in corporations listed in the United States by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The COBIT Framework (Control Objectives for Information Technology) is a widely used framework promulgated by the IT Governance Institute, which defines a variety of ITGC and application control objectives and recommended evaluation approaches. IT departments in organizations are often led by a Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is responsible for ensuring effective information technology controls are utilized.\n\nITGC represent the foundation of the IT control structure. They help ensure the reliability of data generated by IT systems and support the assertion that systems operate as intended and that output is reliable. ITGC usually include the following types of controls:\n\nIT application or program controls are fully automated (i.e., performed automatically by the systems) designed to ensure the complete and accurate processing of data, from input through output. These controls vary based on the business purpose of the specific application. These controls may also help ensure the privacy and security of data transmitted between applications. Categories of IT application controls may include:\n\n\nThe organization's Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is typically responsible for the security, accuracy and the reliability of the systems that manage and report the company's data, including financial data. Financial accounting and enterprise resource planning systems are integrated in the initiating, authorizing, processing, and reporting of financial data and may be involved in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, to the extent they mitigate specific financial risks.\n\nCOBIT is a widely utilized framework containing best practices for the governance and management of information and technology, aimed at the whole enterprise. It consists of domains and processes. The basic structure indicates that IT processes satisfy business requirements, which is enabled by specific IT activities. COBIT defines the design factors that should be considered by the enterprise to build a best-fit governance system. COBIT addresses governance issues by grouping relevant governance components into governance and management\nobjectives that can be managed to the required capability levels.\n\nThe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) identifies five components of internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring, that need to be in place to achieve financial reporting and disclosure objectives; COBIT provide a similar detailed guidance for IT, while the interrelated Val IT concentrates on higher-level IT governance and value-for-money issues. The five components of COSO can be visualized as the horizontal layers of a three-dimensional cube, with the COBIT objective domains-applying to each individually and in aggregate. The four COBIT major domains are: plan and organize, acquire and implement, deliver and support, and monitor and evaluate.\n\nSOX (part of United States federal law) requires the chief executive and chief financial officers of public companies to attest to the accuracy of financial reports (Section 302) and require public companies to establish adequate internal controls over financial reporting (Section 404). Passage of SOX resulted in an increased focus on IT controls, as these support financial processing and therefore fall into the scope of management's assessment of internal control under Section 404 of SOX. \n\nThe COBIT framework may be used to assist with SOX compliance, although COBIT is considerably wider in scope. The 2007 SOX guidance from the PCAOB and SEC state that IT controls should only be part of the SOX 404 assessment to the extent that specific financial risks are addressed, which significantly reduces the scope of IT controls required in the assessment. This scoping decision is part of the entity's SOX 404 top-down risk assessment. In addition, Statements on Auditing Standards No. 109 (SAS109) discusses the IT risks and control objectives pertinent to a financial audit and is referenced by the SOX guidance.\n\nIT controls that typically fall under the scope of a SOX 404 assessment may include:\n\n\nSpecific activities that may occur to support the assessment of the key controls above include:\n\n\nTo comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, organizations must understand how the financial reporting process works and must be able to identify the areas where technology plays a critical part. In considering which controls to include in the program, organizations should recognize that IT controls can have a direct or indirect impact on the financial reporting process. For instance, IT application controls that ensure completeness of transactions can be directly related to financial assertions. Access controls, on the other hand, exist within these applications or within their supporting systems, such as databases, networks and operating systems, are equally important, but do not directly align to a financial assertion. Application controls are generally aligned with a business process that gives rise to financial reports. While there are many IT systems operating within an organization, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance only focuses on those that are associated with a significant account or related business process and mitigate specific material financial risks. This focus on risk enables management to significantly reduce the scope of IT general control testing in 2007 relative to prior years.\n\nSection 409 requires public companies to disclose information about material changes in their financial condition or operations on a rapid basis. Companies need to determine whether their existing financial systems, such as enterprise resource management applications are capable of providing data in real time, or if the organization will need to add such capabilities or use specialty software to access the data. Companies must also account for changes that occur externally, such as changes by customers or business partners that could materially impact its own financial positioning (e.g. key customer/supplier bankruptcy and default).\n\nTo comply with Section 409, organizations should assess their technological capabilities in the following categories: \n\nSection 802 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires public companies and their public accounting firms to maintain all audit or review work papers for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal period in which the audit or review was concluded. This includes electronic records which are created, sent, or received in connection with an audit or review. As external auditors rely to a certain extent on the work of internal audit, it would imply that internal audit records must also comply with Section 802.\n\nIn conjunction with document retention, another issue is that of the security of storage media and how well electronic documents are protected for both current and future use. The five-year record retention requirement means that current technology must be able to support what was stored five years ago. Due to rapid changes in technology, some of today’s media might be outdated in the next three or five years. Audit data retained today may not be retrievable not because of data degradation, but because of obsolete equipment and storage media.\n\nSection 802 expects organizations to respond to questions on the management of SOX content. IT-related issues include policy and standards on record retention, protection and destruction, online storage, audit trails, integration with an enterprise repository, market technology, SOX software and more. In addition, organizations should be prepared to defend the quality of their records management program (RM); comprehensiveness of RM (i.e. paper, electronic, transactional communications, which includes emails, instant messages, and spreadsheets that are used to analyze financial results), adequacy of retention life cycle, immutability of RM practices, audit trails and the accessibility and control of RM content.\n\nPC-based spreadsheets or databases are often used to provide critical data or calculations related to financial risk areas within the scope of a SOX 404 assessment. Financial spreadsheets are often categorized as end-user computing (EUC) tools that have historically been absent traditional IT controls. They can support complex calculations and provide significant flexibility. However, with flexibility and power comes the risk of errors, an increased potential for fraud, and misuse for critical spreadsheets not following the software development lifecycle (e.g. design, develop, test, validate, deploy). To remediate and control spreadsheets, public organizations may implement controls such as:\n\n\nResponsibility for control over spreadsheets is a shared responsibility with the business users and IT. The IT organization is typically concerned with providing a secure shared drive for storage of the spreadsheets and data backup. The business personnel are responsible for the remainder.\n\n\n"}

Hogg was an avid art collector, and owned works by Picasso, Klee, and Matisse, among others. Hogg donated hundreds of pieces of artwork to Houston's Museum of Fine Arts and served on a committee to plan the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. An enthusiastic collector of early American antiques, she also served on a committee tasked with locating historical furniture for the White House. She restored and refurbished several properties, including the Varner plantation and Bayou Bend, which she later donated to Texas arts and historical institutions who maintain the facilities and their collections today. Hogg received numerous awards and honors, including the Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Santa Rita Award from the University of Texas System, and an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Southwestern University.\n\nHogg was the daughter of Sarah Ann \"Sallie\" Stinson and James Stephen \"Big Jim\" Hogg, later attorney general and governor of the state. Ima Hogg's first name was taken from \"The Fate of Marvin\", an epic poem written by her uncle Thomas Hogg. She endeavored to downplay her unusual name by signing her first name illegibly and having her stationery printed with \"I. Hogg\" or \"Miss Hogg\". Although it was rumored that Hogg had a sister named \"Ura Hogg\", she had only brothers. Hogg's father left public office in 1895, and soon after, her mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis. When Sarah died later that year, Jim Hogg's widowed elder sister moved to Austin to care for the Hogg children. Between 1899 and 1901, Hogg attended the University of Texas at Austin; she then moved to New York City to study piano and music theory for two years. After her father's death in 1906, she traveled to Europe and spent two years studying music under Xaver Scharwenka in Vienna. When she returned to Texas, she established and managed the Houston Symphony Orchestra and served as president of the Symphony Society.\n\nThe discovery of oil on her family's cotton plantation made Hogg very wealthy, and she used this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with mental health problems or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for a seat on the Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.\n\nAfter the birth of his only daughter, Jim Hogg wrote to his brother, \"Our cup of joy is now overflowing! We have a daughter of as fine proportions and of as angelic mien as ever gracious nature favor a man with, and her name is Ima!\" Ima Hogg had no middle name, which was unusual for the time. Her first name was taken from her uncle Thomas Hogg's epic Civil War poem \"The Fate of Marvin\", which featured two young women named Ima and Leila. According to Virginia Bernhard's biography of Ima Hogg, \"there are some who believe that James Stephen Hogg … named his only daughter Ima Hogg to attract the attention of Texas voters\" in a year when he was running in a close race for district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas, which he won. Alternatively, correspondence from Jim Hogg indicates he may not have been conscious of the combined effect of his daughter's first and last names.\n\nIma Hogg later recounted that \"my grandfather Stinson lived fifteen miles [24 km] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When he learned of his granddaughter's name he came trotting to town as fast as he could to protest but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain.\" During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, \"my good name\". Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a scrawl that left her first name illegible. Her personal stationery was usually printed \"Miss Hogg\" or \"I. Hogg\", and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions. Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself \"Imogene\". Her last passport was issued to \"Ima Imogene Hogg\".\n\nContrary to popular belief, Ima did not have a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for re-election as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. \"The Kansas City Star\" even invented another sister, Hoosa.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Hogg worked on a collection of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published about her father. According to Bernhard, \"the very fact that Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness.\"\n\nIma Hogg has been the source of \"unfortunate name\" or \"worst baby name\" jokes, lists, and contests, including the incorrect lore that Jim Hogg had named his two daughters \"Ima Hogg\" and \"Ura Hogg\". Similar unfortunate baby names according to United States Census records include Ima Pigg, Ima Muskrat, Ima Nut, Ima Hooker, Ima Weiner, Ima Reck, Ima Pain and Ima Butt.\n\nIma Hogg was born in Mineola, Texas in 1882 to Jim Hogg and Sarah Ann \"Sallie\" Stinson. She was the second of four children, including brothers William Clifford Hogg (1875–1930), Michael Hogg (1885–1941), and Thomas Elisha Hogg (1887–1949). The Hogg family had long been active in public service. Her great-grandfather, Thomas Hogg, served in the state legislatures of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Her grandfather, Joseph Lewis Hogg, served in the Congress of the Republic of Texas and helped to write the Texas State Constitution. At the time of her birth, Hogg's father was the district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas. His term expired in 1884, and the family moved to Tyler, where he practiced law. Two years later, Jim Hogg was elected Texas Attorney General and the Hogg family moved to the state capital, Austin, where Ima attended kindergarten. When Jim Hogg was elected the first native-born Governor of Texas four years later, Ima accompanied her mother and elder brother to the swearing-in ceremony and inauguration ball in January 1891, thus witnessing the first inauguration in the newly erected Texas State Capitol. The family moved into the Governor's Mansion. Built in 1855, the building was in poor condition, with cracked walls and dilapidated furnishings. Ima and her siblings were expected to help renovate the building to a liveable state—she was required, among other things, to pry chewing gum from the furniture and door moldings.\n\nHogg and her younger brothers were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along the center of the railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she \"never had the patience to succeed\". Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn German. Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.\n\nThe children liked animals, and their menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot. The children once used their animals to conduct a circus on the grounds of the Governor's Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme. In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot. Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a picture book, \"Ima & the Great Texas Ostrich Race\", by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.\n\nHer mother never regained her strength after Thomas's birth, and for the remainder of her life was a semi-invalid. Ima accompanied her to several health spas during their years in Austin. In 1895, Sarah was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and on the recommendation of her doctor, she and Ima moved to Colorado, where they lived with Jim Hogg's elder sister, Martha Francis Davis. Sarah Hogg died in Colorado on September 25, 1895.\n\nDavis accompanied the family to Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers. Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis and watched her son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry so as not to pass on the illness. By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in San Marcos. The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father. Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the lady of the house and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers. In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to Hawaii, where they met Hawaiian Queen Liliʻuokalani and watched the ceremony that delivered Hawaii to the United States. The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship. Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she \"had an awful feeling\". He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.\n\nMusic was always present at the Hogg household, and Ima began learning to play the piano at age three. Although her younger brothers attended public school, Ima was enrolled at a private school and received private music lessons. In 1899, she entered the University of Texas at Austin (UT), where her favorite courses were German, Old English, and psychology. She later remarked that \"No freshman was ever more immature, more unprepared, more frightened than I.\" She joined the female social club known as the Valentine Club, and helped to inaugurate the first sorority on the UT campus, Pi Beta Phi. After two years at the university, she moved to New York City to study piano and music theory at the National Conservatory of Music.\n\nNear the turn of the 20th century, Hogg's father began speculating in oil. He purchased of land near West Columbia in 1901, land that had been part of the Varner plantation. After two years of study in New York City, Ima Hogg returned to Texas, dividing her time between the plantation and Houston, where her father had a law practice. Under her supervision, the house was later remodeled and a portico was added to what had been the back of the house; she made this the new front entrance, orienting the house away from Varner Creek.\n\nOn January 26, 1905, Jim Hogg suffered an injury in a train accident. For the next year Ima nursed him as he struggled to regain his health, but on March 3, 1906, she discovered her father dead in his bed. Ima was devastated; to quell her grief, her brother William took her to New York City. During her stay she immersed herself in concerts and museums.\n\nIn 1907, she vacationed in Germany, and enjoyed her time so much that she chose to remain in Europe to continue her piano studies. For the next two years she studied music in Vienna under Franz Xaver Scharwenka, pianist to the court of Francis Joseph I of Austria, and in Berlin under Martin Krause. After returning from Europe, Hogg settled in Houston with her brother William. Although the city had a population of about 100,000, it had no museums or parks and no professional theater, music, or ballet groups. Hogg chose to teach music and continued in this vocation for the next nine years. One of her first pupils was Jacques Abram, who later became a concert pianist. By 1913, Hogg had become president of the Girls' Musical Society and was on the entertainment committee of the College Women's Club, which organized a small theater group known as the Green Mask Players. That year, she organized the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Hogg served as the vice-president of the Symphony Society when the first session of the board of directors convened. In 1917 the board of directors requested that she serve as president; she went on to serve 12 terms.\n\nHogg was affectionately known as \"Miss Ima\" by those who knew her, and widely considered to be \"The First Lady of Texas\". When John B. Connally was Governor of Texas, his wife Nellie declared, \"The Governor's wife is usually called the First Lady of the State, but Ima always has been and always will be the First Lady of Texas.\" In 1957, \"The New York Times\" featured prominent Texans in a series about high society, stating: \"But one social figure celebrated throughout the state and even beyond its border is Miss Ima Hogg. She is now about 80 but still a civic beacon of Houston.\"\n\nAfter their father's death in 1906, Hogg and her brothers tried to sell the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15 years. On January 15, 1918, oil was found on the Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month (equivalent to $ million a month in ) shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.\n\nHogg founded the Houston Child Guidance Center in 1929 to provide counseling for disturbed children and their families. Hogg was convinced that if children's emotional and mental problems were treated, more serious illness could be prevented in adults. Her interest in mental health came from her father, who had read widely on mental health issues; during his terms as governor, Ima had often accompanied him on visits to state institutions, including charity hospitals and asylums for the mentally ill. She furthered her knowledge of the field while she was a student at UT, taking several courses in psychology. Ima was convinced that her youngest brother, Tom, would have benefited from similar intervention, as he had reacted badly after their mother's death and as an adult was \"restless, impulsive, and alarmingly careless with money\". Although her ideas on mental health would be considered mainstream today, in 1929 they were pioneering. In 1972, she told the \"Houston Chronicle\" that, of all her activities, she had derived most pleasure from her role in establishing the Houston Child Guidance Center.\n\nHogg had previously suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, a specialist in the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.\n\nHogg joined her elder brother William on a vacation in Germany in 1930. During their visit, he suffered a gallbladder attack and died on September 12, 1930 after emergency surgery. Ima brought her brother's body back to the United States. His will bequeathed $2.5 million to UT; his desire was that it be used alongside money donated by his sister for \"far-reaching benefit to the people of Texas\". Legal challenges tied up the grant until 1939, when the university received $1.8 million. In 1940, after discussion with her brother Michael—the executor of the will—Hogg used the money to establish the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe \"San Antonio Express\" reported in 1939 that the funds granted to the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health would be used to establish mental hygiene clinics and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for mental health research, and to survey mental hygiene conditions in Texas. On the entry of the United States into World War II, the Foundation researched methods to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing mental health care to the poor and the aged. The Foundation continues to award five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a Master's degree in Social Work.\n\nIn 1943, Hogg decided to run for a seat on the Houston School Board so that the board would include two female members. Hogg won with 4,350 votes, more than 1,000 ahead of the runner-up. During her term, she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay. She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems and began art education programs in the schools for black students. Hogg declined to run for a second term.\n\nHogg and her brothers were avid art collectors; she owned a large collection, including Native American art and works by Picasso, Chagall, Matisse and Modigliani. Her interest in collecting began during her convalescence in Philadelphia. Her first purchase, in 1922, was a Spanish foot chair or Queen Anne maple chair with carved feet. She researched the early American furniture market extensively, personally visiting Luke Vincent Lockwood, the author of the standard work on the topic, for more information. At the time, Hogg was one of a small number of people who believed that American antiques had value—by contrast, most collectors concentrated on furniture built in Europe. Other collectors soon saw the value in early American pieces. Hogg remained one of the few collectors not located on the East Coast. As her collection grew, she was often asked to loan pieces for exhibit in New England; Hogg always refused, stating \"they've got plenty of these things up there\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Hogg's brothers began to develop a new elite neighborhood, which they called River Oaks, which at that time was on the outskirts of Houston. For their home, the Hoggs chose the largest lot, . Ima worked closely with architect John Staub to design a house that would show off the art the family had purchased. William and Ima moved into the house, which she christened Bayou Bend, in 1928. In 1939, when she restored her estate along American lines, she donated more than 100 works on paper to Houston's Museum of Fine Arts (MFAH), including works by Cézanne, Sargent, Picasso, and Klee. Following the death of her brother Michael in 1941, she donated his collection of Frederic Remington works to the museum. Consisting of 53 oil paintings, 10 watercolors, and one bronze, it is known as the Hogg Brothers Collection, and is \"one of the most important groupings of Western paintings on display in an American museum\", according to Hogg biographer Neely. Hogg donated her collection of Native American art to MFAH in 1944, including 168 pieces of pottery, 95 pieces of jewelry, and 81 paintings.\n\nIn 1960, she was appointed by President Eisenhower to serve on a committee to plan the National Cultural Center, now called the Kennedy Center, in Washington, D.C. In 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy named Hogg to the 18-member advisory committee to work with the Fine Arts Committee in seeking historical furniture for the White House.\n\nAlthough Hogg spent little time at the Varner plantation after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair as well as his collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.\n\nAs the Varner–Hogg restoration wound to a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed some of her personal collection of antiques and artwork. \"The New York Times\" described her \"superb Early American furniture\" collection in 1953, and she had a large collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: \"I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until I had so much of it I didn't know what to do with it. I decided to give it to a museum.\" She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.\n\nSeveral residents of River Oaks sued to prevent Bayou Bend becoming a museum, but Hogg prevailed in court. To alleviate the residents' concerns over increased traffic, she asked the city of Houston to build a footbridge over Buffalo Bayou so that visitors could reach the house without having to drive through River Oaks. In the fall of 1965, Hogg moved out of her home, telling the docents that \"When you love something enough it's easy to give it up in order to see it go on.\" The MFAH opened the new museum to the public in 1966 as MFAH's Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens. At its dedication, Charles Montgomery, a senior research fellow at the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum, called Bayou Bend \"the largest, finest collection this side of Winterthur\".\n\nIn 1963, Hogg purchased property near Round Top, hoping to move its historic building to Bayou Bend. When that plan proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top. After personally supervising the restoration of the Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center, and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In 1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor. The museum holds items from the history of Wood County and northeast Texas. She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.\n\nDavid Warren, the first curator of Bayou Bend, said Hogg was \"small and dainty and feminine—and smart and sharp and knowledgeable—all rolled into one\". Her biographer Bernhard described her as \"elegantly and stylishly dressed\", tall and of fair complexion, \"independent and self-possessed\" and noted that she could \"sugarcoat her single-mindedness with layers of charm\". At the age of 81, she was described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"blue-eyed strawberry blonde\".\n\nOne morning in 1914, Hogg was awakened by a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was attempting to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but \"wrote down a name and address, handed it to him and told him to go there that very day to get a job\". When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, \"He didn't look like a bad man.\" Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.\n\nThough Bernard describes Hogg as a woman of \"unfailing politeness\", the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist Arthur Rubinstein, he characterized her as a \"tiresome old woman\". Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as \"a pompous old man\". By contrast, Hogg said of Vladimir Horowitz, whom she met backstage at a 1975 concert in Houston, \"Such a nice man. Not at all like that Mr. Rubinstein.\"\n\nHogg was a generous benefactor, and believed that \"inherited money was a public trust\". She was described by the University of Houston as \"compassionate by nature\", \"progressive in outlook\", \"concerned with the welfare of all Texans\", a \"zealous proponent of mental health care\" and \"committed to public education\". Hogg was a lifelong Democrat.\n\nHogg died on August 19, 1975, at the age of 93, from a heart attack resulting from atheroma. She had been vacationing in London at the time, but fell as she was getting into a taxi, and died a few days later in a London hospital. An autopsy report revealed that her death was not related to the earlier fall. On receiving news of her death, the University of Texas declared two days of mourning and flew the flag at half-staff.\n\nAt the time of her death, Hogg had employed her personal maid, Gertrude Vaughn, for 56 years, and her butler-chauffeur, Lucious Broadnax, for over 40 years. She is buried next to her family in the Oakwood Cemetery in Austin. Hogg's work lives on through the Ima Hogg Foundation, which she founded in 1964 and which was the major beneficiary of her will.\nHogg never married; her biographer Bernhard reports that she told a friend \"she had gotten over 30 proposals of marriage but 'wouldn't have any of them'\".\n\nHogg received many awards for her contributions to the community. The Garden Club of America honored her in 1959 with the Amy Angell Colliers Montague Model for Civic Achievement. In 1966, she was honored at the 20th annual awards banquet of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. She received the seventh annual Louise du Pont Crowninshield Award—the highest award given by the National Trust for Historic Preservation—for \"superlative achievement in the preservation, restoration and interpretation of sites, buildings, architecture, districts, and objects of national historical or cultural significance\" in Texas.\n\nIn 1968, Hogg became the first recipient of the Santa Rita Award—the highest award given by the University of Texas System—for contributions to higher education. She was presented with an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Southwestern University in 1971. In 1969, she became the third woman (after Lady Bird Johnson and Oveta Culp Hobby) invited to become a member of the Academy of Texas, a society which recognized efforts to \"enrich, enlarge or enlighten\" knowledge in any field. She also became the first female president in the 110-year history of the Philosophical Society of Texas.\n\nHer restoration work was recognized by many organizations. The National Society of Interior Designers named her to their International Honors List in 1965 and in 1972 presented her with their Thomas Jefferson Award for her contributions to cultural heritage. The Texas State Historical Survey Committee recognized Hogg in 1967 for her \"meritorious service in historic preservation\" and the American Association of State and Local History gave her an award of merit in 1969.\n\nThe Houston Symphony established a scholarship in Hogg's name, honored her on her 90th birthday with a special concert, and holds an annual Ima Hogg Young Artist Competition for musicians between the ages of 13 and 30 who perform on orchestral instruments or the piano. The Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin presents an annual Ima Hogg Award for Historical Achievement. She was a National Patroness of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. The Mental Health Association of Greater Houston presents an annual Ima Hogg Award \"to an individual or couple who have advanced mental health causes\".\n\nThe site of her birthplace at 125 N. Line Street in Mineola, Texas is marked with a Texas Historical Commission subject marker.\n\nIn 1963, former Governor of Texas Allan Shivers—when presenting Hogg with the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the University of Texas Ex-Students Association (the first woman so honored)—said of \"Miss Ima\":\n<poem>Some persons create history.\nSome record it.\nOthers restore and conserve it.\nShe has done all three.</poem>\n\n\n\n"}

New England is in the Northeastern United States, and comprises six states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Listed are well-known names of towns, significant bodies of water, and mountains. This list can virtually never be sufficiently completed as there are hundreds of thousands of place names in New England.\n\nAll the names in this section come to us only through persons whose first language was English and only rarely knew any other. From the few sources who were bilingual, we are fortunate to have some concept of how some of the names were segmented in the languages from which they came. Those names often tend to predominate in lists such as these, just because they are more easily understood.\n\nMost names were received by English settlers who had little idea what they meant. Being naturally curious, they asked the natives what the names meant or conjectured among themselves or both. The natives were faced with having to explain the name in a language they knew but rudimentarily. They interpreted freely, often giving the use or features of interest about the place rather than trying to explain the elements of their language to the English. They never had a linguist's understanding of the structure of their language. Their descendants, speaking primarily English, no longer knew how to produce meaningful utterances in the language of their native forefathers.\n\nConsequently, the names can be divided into roughly two categories: those for which the original morphology is known to some degree and those for which it is not. The meanings of the latter category are traditional only, but the tradition may not necessarily descend from a native speaker. It may have been a settler's conjecture, passed on through the social mechanism of the sacred words of the forefathers or simply because no other interpretation was available.\n\nThe mechanism can be seen most clearly in names for which both categories of meaning exist. You might read that a name is supposed to mean \"the place of portage\" or \"the pines\" when in fact those meanings are not even implied by the morphology of the name. It is entirely possible, however, that those places were used for those purposes. On the other hand, some settler may have guessed that they were used for those purposes. In cases where there is no morphology there is little point in argument over the \"correct meaning\" of the name, an activity enjoyed by New Englanders since settlement times, and which also you will undoubtedly see much of in Wikipedia.\n\nNew England in the early 17th century when English colonists first landed was tenanted by variously named tribes for the most part speaking languages of the Algonquian family. Our aboriginals spoke an eastern branch of the group. It often happened that whole regions were named after the tribe inhabiting it, such as Massachusetts, nor does this appear to have been an English naming convention only. In this the aboriginals were non-different from the tribes of classical Europe, whose names still dot the map of Europe.\n\nLike the tribal names of Europe, the native names descended from an antiquity long lost. The natives themselves may not have known what they meant. For these names we have mainly tradition, but even that should be regarded as more speculative than not.\n\nPlace names on this list represent a number of tribes speaking aboriginal languages within the Algonquian family, for the most part, if in warped or anglicized form:\n\nCommon dialects of the Algonquian languages: Hammonasset, Mahican, Montauk, Niantic, Paugussett, Pequot-Mohegan, Podunk, Poquonock, Quinnipiac, Tunxi, Wangunk\n\n\nCommon languages:\n\nCommon languages:\n\nCommon Languages: Abnaki, Nipmuc, Pennacook\n\n\nCommon languages:\n\nCommon languages: Abnaki, Mahican\n\n\n\n\n"}

It publishes 15 issues per year with content that includes news, articles, profiles, and general entertainment pieces. Each issue also includes from 400 to more than 1,000 wine reviews, which consist of wine ratings and tasting notes. The publication also awards its 100 chosen top wineries each year with the \"Winery of the Year Awards\".\n\n\"Wine Spectator\", like most other major wine publications, rates wine on a 100-point scale. The magazine's policy also states that editors review wines in blind tastings. Wine Spectator's current critics include executive editor Thomas Mathews; editor-at-large Harvey Steiman; senior editors James Laube, Kim Marcus, Bruce Sanderson, Tim Fish, James Molesworth, Alison Napjus and MaryAnn Worobiec; associate editor Gillian Sciaretta and associate tasting coordinator Aleksandar Zecevic. Past critics include former managing editor Jim Gordon, Per-Henrik Mansson, former senior editor and European bureau chief James Suckling, who served at the magazine from 1981 to 2010, and former senior editor Nathan Wesley, who worked in the magazine's tasting department from 2005 to 2013.\n\nFounded as a San Diego-based tabloid newspaper by Bob Morrisey in 1976, \"Wine Spectator\" was purchased three years later by current publisher and editor Marvin R. Shanken. That year, its panel of experts blind tasted and reviewed over 12,400 wines.\n\nIn 1981 the magazine introduced its Restaurant Awards program, which reviews restaurant wine lists on three levels: the Award of Excellence (basic), Best of Award of Excellence (second-tier), and the Grand Award (highest). As of 2017, more than 3,500 restaurants held one of these awards.\n\nThe magazine organized and sponsored the \"Wine Spectator\" Wine Tasting of 1986 on the tenth anniversary of the \"Judgment of Paris\".\n\nIn 2008 the magazine was ranked by the Luxury Institute as the #1 business and consumer publication among wealthy readers.\n\n\"Wine Spectator\" operates the Wine Experience, a yearly event that includes wine tastings, seminars, lunches and an awards banquet. In 2017, more than 5,000 people attended in New York City where more than 265 wines were poured just at the two evening Grand Tastings.\n\nThe magazine's Grand Tour takes the tastings on the road to three cities each spring, with more than 240 wineries pouring at the events.\n\nThe magazine also runs the Wine Spectator Scholarship Foundation, which as of 2016 has raised more than $20 million to support wine and food education and scholarship programs.\n\nThe magazine's Restaurant Awards program has come under some criticism. At the August 2008 conference of the American Association of Wine Economists in Portland, Oregon, a hoax exposé submission of the fictitious restaurant Osteria L’Intrepido was revealed by the author and Fearless Critic founder Robin Goldstein: he had won an Award of Excellence for a restaurant that didn't exist and whose \"reserve wine list\" was full of the lowest-rated Italian wines in history. He stated the exposé to be part of research for an academic paper, whose aim was to discover what it takes for a restaurant's wine list to receive an award from the magazine. With nearly 4,500 restaurant applications, the magazine takes in over $1 million each year from submission fees. Editor Thomas Matthews published an official response on the magazine's forum site.\n\n\n"}

The image was canonically crowned by Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.\n\nIn the central image, the Virgin Mary has a gold dress, is being crowned by two angels and is surrounded by a ring of stars. Below the image a ribbon carries the inscription: \"Queen of Poland, give us days of peace.\" The image measures 9.5 × 15.5 cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25 cm. There is a second crown above the image, on the larger panel.\n\nThe icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier (called Thomas Kłossowski) was wounded in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in Grąblin as instructed.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic, but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for performing miracles.\n\nOn 29 September 1852 the image was moved to the parish church in Licheń and remained there until 2006. Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the Primate of the Millennium gave its Canonical Coronation towards the image with the approval of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.\n\nIn 1994 the construction of the new basilica of Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen was started to house the image and accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Pope John Paul II blessed the basilica in 1999. The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the world. The basilica's organ created by Prof. Andrzej Chorosiński and manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest in the world. On July 2, 2006 the image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.\n\n"}

It uses Nikon's own JFET-LBCAST sensor with a 4.1-megapixel resolution, and is optimised for sports and action shooting that require a high frame rate. In 2005, the D2H was replaced by the D2Hs, which added new features derived from the 12-megapixel D2X digital SLR. The D2Hs was discontinued after the introduction of the D300 and D3 models.\n\nLike most early Nikon Digital SLR cameras, it uses a \"DX Format\" sensor, which applies a crop factor compared to 35 mm film of approximately 1.5×.\n\nThe D2Hs was announced on February 16, 2005, adding several improvements to the D2H design, although with the same sensor and body. Nikon added an improved light metering system, faster subject acquisition and tracking algorithms to the Multi-CAM-2000 Autofocus module, and expanded both the JPEG and RAW continuous shooting buffer.\n\nNikon also reported improved noise reduction at high sensor sensitivities. The ASIC image processing was changed to 12-bit from the original D2H 8-bit. Auto White Balance was altered with improved low color temperature lighting, mixed ambient, and speedlight lighting. SYCC color space was added, and Exif compliance was adjusted from Exif 2.2 to Exif 2.21, DCF 2.0, and DPOF.\n\nGPS support and improved wireless support (with WT-2 transmitter for 802.11b/g) were also added. A new LCD screen of the same size but with increased resolution and a higher refresh rate was added to the body. The screen's playback mode now supports 15x zoom instead of the 8x of the D2H, with RGB Histogram.\n\nThe menus have been expanded to include an additional 5 languages for a total of 10. Like the D2X, it features a recent settings list, world time function, and modified vertical shooting buttons and CompactFlash card door opening.\n\nThe D2Hs features a continuous burst rate of up to 8 frames per second, with a buffer capacity of 50 JPEG files or 40 NEF (Nikon Electric Format- Nikon's proprietary Camera RAW image format) files. The 4.1 megapixel sensor has an ISO sensitivity equivalency of ISO 200–1600, in 1/3, 1/2, and 1 stop increments, as well as Hi-1 and Hi-2 ISO boosts (3200 and 6400 equivalency).\n\nIt offers full compatibility with AF-S, VR, DX, D and G type AF-Nikkor lenses, all functions except autofocus and some exposure modes with D-type Manual Focus Nikkors, with AI-P Nikkors all functions except 3D Color Matrix Metering II, 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash and AF possible.\n\nThe D2Hs, like the D2X, offers compatibility with Non-CPU AI Nikkor lenses, which are usable in aperture-priority or manual exposure mode with Matrix-Metering, Center-Weighted and Spot metering available.\n\nAlthough the D2Hs has been considered by some to be obsolete from its very introduction due to its relatively low 4.1 megapixel resolution, the D2Hs has a reputation for extremely high image quality and excellent detail rendition.\n\nThe D2Hs offers a noticeable improvement over the D2H in overall image quality and many users have reported that color rendition is improved in JPEG files (raw is the same), while the camera manages to offer a great improvement in noise at high sensitivities versus the D2H\n\nThe D2H series has a relatively weak infrared (IR) filter, allowing infrared photography with the use of an IR bandpass filter, but contaminating regular images by causing certain dark-colored fabrics to take on a slight magenta color cast. Skin tones may also appear slightly ruddy. Use of a No. 486 digital UV/IR blocking filter can help resolve the problem with lenses that are at least 50 mm or longer. Lenses shorter than 50 mm are not recommended for use with a No. 486 filter due to a tendency for the corners of the image to take on a cyan color cast.\n\n"}

Malegaon is the second largest city of Nashik district after Nashik city and one of the largest cities in North Maharashtra.\n\nMalegaon (previously Maligaon) at the confluence of the Mausam (previously Moosy) and Girna rivers.\n\nOn the road linking Mumbai and Agra – now national highway No 3, NH3 – it used to be a small junction known as \"Maliwadi\" (hamlet of gardens). It quickly gained the reputation for being a source of employment in 1740 when a local jahagirdar, Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, started building a fort in the area. As the fort took 25 years, a sizeable number of Muslim workers and artisans from places like Surat and northern India settled in the area.\n\nAfter the British capture of the Malegaon fort in 1818, Muslims from Hyderabad migrated to the region. The 1857 revolt saw many Muslims from the north move here, and the pattern repeated over the years. Malegaon, with its growing Muslim presence, became something of a shelter and a source of employment for the community whenever it faced reversals. If famine in 1862 forced Muslim weavers in the Varanasi area to move to Malegaon, the political upheavals in the Hyderabad of the late 1940s and 1950s saw a similar exodus to the town. Communal riots, especially from the 1960s onward, have undoubtedly contributed to swelling the number of Muslim migrants to Malegaon.\n\nMalegaon is at the confluence of the Girna and Mausam rivers, at elevation of 438 metres (1437 feet) at .\n\nIt is 280 km northeast of the state capital Mumbai. It has good connectivity with nearby cities like Nashik, Manmad, Mumbai and Dhule.\n\nRoads:\n\nMalegaon is a major hub for cloth weaving using early 20th century power looms. The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.\n\nWith the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.\n\nIn recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines. Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.\n\nMalegaon of late has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.\n\nMalegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as \"Malegaon ki Sholay\", \"Malegaon ke Karan arjun\", \"Malegaon ka James Bond\" and \"Supermen of Malegaon,\" the impoverished film-maker invaded national television with his second version of \"Malegaon Ka Chintu\", \"Chintu ban gaya Gentleman\", a mute comedy based loosely on Mr. Bean.\n\nA crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies. They have made several short films like \"Dillage\", \"Caller Tunes\", \"The Lost Lover\", and \"Independence\". The crew is currently working on their next feature film.\n\nMollywood artists work on daily wages. They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. \"Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun,\" for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.\n\nIn the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of \"ADD Films\" production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.\n\nThe male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, Jainya, Shafique Chotu, Badshah Khan, Ramzan Shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.\n\nVillages near Malegaon and towards Satana, Nampur Talwade and vadel are indulged into agriculture and major producers of onions. Pomegranate is another crop of commercial importance that is cultivated by farmers in nearby pockets. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) of Malegaon has a front office at Malegaon and research farm at Vadel. There is also a campus of Mahatma Gandhi Vidyamandir's H. H. Sri Sri Murlidhara Swamiji College of Agriculture in the Malegaon Camp area.\n\n India census, Malegaon city had urban/metropolitan population of 576,642. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Malegaon has an average literacy rate of 87.61%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: Male literacy is 90.35% and female literacy is 84.81%. About 18% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nIn Malegaon City Islam is the most popular religion with approximately 75.53% following it. 22.44% of the population following Hinduism as their religion. In Malegaon city, Christianity is followed by 0.10%, Jainism by 0.82%, Buddhism by 1.42%, and Sikhism by 0.04%. Around 0.02% stated 'other religion' and approximately 0.15% stated 'no particular religion'.

There are enough schools for primary, secondary, and higher secondary education. There are junior colleges and senior colleges affiliated by Pune University. The students of Malegaon travel to nearby cities for higher education.\n\nSchools and colleges in Malegaon include:\nJamia Mohammadia ; Mansoora It has many faculties e.g. Tibbiya College; Engineering College; Arabic Language and Islamic Studies College; Afaque Acedmy; Girls College etc.\n\nOn 29 September 2008, three bombs exploded in the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra killing eight people and injuring 80. During the investigation in Maharashtra, a Hindu group was alleged to have been involved in the blasts. Three of the arrested suspects were identified as Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Shiv Narayan Gopal Singh Kalsanghra, and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu. All three were produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court in Nashik, which remanded them to custody till 3 November. On 28 October, the Shiv Sena, came out in support of the accused saying that the arrests were political in nature. , the sectarian Hindutvadi Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray, propounded a potential conflict of interest in political rivalry as the secular Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled the relevant ministry. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has found evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and it has recommended the court to act against all charges against her.\n\nThe Indian Army officer Prasad Shrikant Purohit was also accused of being involved in the blast. His counsel alleged that he was being falsely framed for political reasons because he has intelligence data of a sensitive nature pertaining to the operations of Sanathan sanstha, and bajrang Dal which could embarrass some quarters . He was sent on bail by the Supreme Court after nine years of trial on 21 August 21, 2017.\n\nMLAs from Malegaon Constituency for Maharashtra Assembly:\nAll India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen...\n\nMLAs from Malegaon Outer Constituency for Maharashtra Assembly:\n\n\n\n1)@malegaon_memer :\n2)@malegaonkar_mh_41 :\nhttps://instagram.com/malegaonkar_mh_41\n"}

Denman, Jr. and Oliver Steele and published by Screenplay in 1983. The art is by Michael Haire. Steven Baumrucker wrote the sound and music routines, designed and named the levels, and wrote the music. \"Pogo Joe\" is a \"Q*bert\" clone with several extra features.\n\nThe player takes the role of the eponymous Pogo Joe, a boy on a pogo stick. The game takes place over 65 different levels, each consisting of a different arrangement of barrels. To complete a level, Pogo Joe must jump on every barrel. Holding the joystick button lets Pogo Joe jump over a barrel or empty space the width of a barrel. Falling off is impossible.\n\nTo make Pogo Joe's job harder, several enemies inhabit the levels. They first start out as spherical \"eggs\" of different colours. Colliding with these \"eggs\" kills the enemy within them, but if left alone for a few seconds, the \"eggs\" hatch into different sorts of enemies. Most are fatal to Pogo Joe, but a few are not.\n\nThe tops of the barrels have different colours depending on their status or functionality:\n\nSome enemies change red barrels back to white when jumping on them. These enemies are not fatal to Pogo Joe.\n\nOn some levels, the barrels appear with just their tops, without the body beneath it.

The company offers dessert cakes, donuts, cookies, cup cakes, loaf cakes, pies, cereal bars, muffins, Danish pastries, crumb cakes, and buns among other baked goods. In the past several years, they have added designer coffee flavors along with scented candles to their product line in an effort to broaden its appeal.\n\nToday, over 100 different items carry the Entenmann's brand, which is currently owned by Bimbo Bakeries USA.\n\nEntenmann's as a company is over 120 years old and originated in New York City. William Entenmann learned the trade of baking from his father in Stuttgart, Germany, and used his acquired skills to work in a bakery in the US, eventually opening his own bakery in 1898 on Rogers Avenue in Brooklyn. Later, William moved his bakery to Bay Shore, Long Island. Home delivery was a substantial part of the bakery that William owned, eventually turning into 30 home delivery routes by the time his son, William Jr, took over the bakery. While William Jr headed the bakery, it flourished; Frank Sinatra was a weekly customer.\n\nWilliam Jr died in 1951, leaving the bakery to his wife Martha and their sons, Robert, Charles, and William. The family phased out bread in order to focus on pastries and cakes, and began supplying grocery stores rather than offering home delivery. In 1959, the Entenmann family invented the \"see-through\" cake box used by many bakeries today. In 1961, the business grew, with new bakeries and factories in Bay Shore, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\n\nPlans to expand nationally stalled in 1970. Entenmann's Bakery, with the assistance of new product consultants at Calle and Company, reformulated from heavier New England-style baked goods to lighter offerings more suitable for hotter, more humid test markets such as Miami and Atlanta. Entenmann's successful national expansion quickly followed. In 1972, Entenmann's started to sell chocolate chip cookies, and has since sold more than 620 million cookies. Since its first opening in 1898, Entenmann's has been selling an \"all-butter loaf cake\", and has sold more than 700 million to date.\n\nSeveral of Entenmann's larger cake-baking methodologies had been converted to \"easy-bake\" style preparation, wherein the recipe allows for assembly-line baking under hot lights rather than oven baking, as evidenced by the total absence of any trace of oven heat signatures at the bottom of their cakes. This allows for a much higher volume of baked output without sacrificing perceived quality. It is not known if this methodology was continued under Grupo Bimbo's oversight.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Warner-Lambert purchased Entenmann's in 1978, and then sold it to General Foods in 1982. General Foods merged with Kraft in 1990. Kraft sold its bakery business to CPC International (later Bestfoods). Bestfoods was purchased by Unilever in 2000, which sold its baking division to George Weston, a Canadian baked goods and supermarket business, the next year. Weston sold its United States interests including Entenmann's, in 2008 to Mexican conglomerate Grupo Bimbo. Other Bimbo Bakeries USA holdings include Thomas', Brownberry, Boboli, Arnold, Oroweat, Freihofer’s, and Stroehmann.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, it was reported that Entenmann's was ceasing baking operations at the Bay Shore location. Other operations, such as sales, the store, and distribution were to continue.\n\n, Entenmann's products include donuts, loaf cakes, pies, Danish, cookies, Enten-minis—Brownies, and desserts that are packed in smaller servings, cereal bars, and 100 Calorie Little Bites.\n\nIn 2007, Entenmann's added a line of coffee products. Coffee Holding Company, Inc made a three-year licensing agreement with Entenmann's Products, Inc, which gives Coffee Holding Company the rights to nationally sell and produce coffee that is branded Entenmann's.\n\nEntenmann's licensed their first non-edible product in September 2008 with the sale of scented candles. The candles were scented as coffee cake, all-butter loaf cake, and raspberry Danish. Other scents such as pumpkin pie and warm gingerbread were added for the holidays, and chocolate chip cookie was made available in spring of 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Entenmann's partnered with White Coffee Corporation for a new collection of flavored coffees and cocoa. The 100% arabica coffee is sold at Burlington Coat Factory, Dollar Tree, and Entenmann's Outlets, with expected sales in mass market, supermarkets, club stores, drug stores, and food service nationwide.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990284", "title": "Man Chong", "text": "Man Chong\n\nMan Chong () (died April or May 242), courtesy name Boning, was a military general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He previously served under the warlord Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He is best known for defending the city of Hefei from a series of invasions by Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, between 230 and 235.\n\nMan Chong was from Changyi County (), Shanyang Commandery (), which is located northwest of present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong. When he was 17, he served as an Investigator () in his home commandery. At the time, there was a group of armed thugs led by Li Shuo () who were causing harm to the locals. After the commandery administrator put Man Chong in charge of dealing with them, Li Shuo surrendered to the authorities and never caused trouble again.\n\nAs Man Chong grew older, he became the Prefect () of Gaoping County (高平縣; northwest of present-day Weishan County, Shandong). Around the time, an official Zhang Bao () was abusing his powers by soliciting bribes and causing trouble for the local administration. One day, Man Chong led his guards into the guesthouse where Zhang Bao stayed and arrested him on allegations of corruption. After Zhang Bao died under torture during the interrogation on the same day, Man Chong resigned and went home.\n\nWhen the warlord Cao Cao held the position of Governor of Yan Province between 191 and 192, he recruited Man Chong to serve as an Assistant Officer () under him. Later, when Cao Cao briefly served as General-in-Chief in 196, he appointed Man Chong as an Assistant in the West Bureau () of his administration. Man Chong was later appointed as the Prefect of Xu County (許縣; present-day Xuchang, Henan), the imperial capital of the Eastern Han dynasty between 196 and 220. During his tenure, Man Chong got into two controversial incidents.\n\nIn the first incident, Cao Hong, one of Cao Cao's cousins and trusted generals, had some retainers under him who broke the law while they were in Xu County. After Man Chong arrested and imprisoned the retainers, Cao Hong wrote to him and asked him to release them. When Man Chong ignored his request, Cao Hong brought up the issue to Cao Cao, who summoned the official in charge to come and see him. Man Chong thought that Cao Cao wanted to pardon Cao Hong's retainers, so he immediately executed them. Cao Cao was pleased when he heard about it and he remarked, \"Isn't this what an officeholder should do?\"\n\nIn the second incident, Yang Biao (), the Grand Commandant, was arrested and imprisoned for allegedly conspiring with Yuan Shu, a warlord who rebelled against the Eastern Han dynasty. Man Chong, who was in charge of interrogating Yang Biao, received requests from his colleagues Xun Yu and Kong Rong to refrain from using torture on Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, Man Chong ignored them and did everything by the book. A few days later, Man Chong reported to Cao Cao: \"Yang Biao had nothing to say when I interrogated him. Before executing a criminal, we must first produce evidence of his guilt and show it to the public. Yang Biao is a reputable man. If we execute him without sufficient evidence to show that he is guilty, the people will lose faith in us. I hope you will reconsider your decision carefully and not be too hasty in ordering Yang Biao's execution.\" Cao Cao then released Yang Biao. Xun Yu and Kong Rong were initially angry with Man Chong when they found out that he tortured Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, they became more amiable towards him after they heard what he told Cao Cao.\n\nThe historian Pei Songzhi criticised Man Chong for his cruelty and said that he should not have tortured Yang Biao, who had a reputation for being virtuous. From his viewpoint, even though Man Chong deserved praise for doing things by the book, it was not enough to make up for his cruelty.\n\nIn 200 CE, the Battle of Guandu broke out between Cao Cao and his rival, Yuan Shao, whose hometown was in Runan Commandery (汝南郡; covering parts of present-day southeastern Henan and northwestern Anhui). Although Yuan Shao was not in Runan Commandery, he maintained some influence there through his retainers, who led small groups of armed men and had strongholds scattered throughout the commandery. Cao Cao was worried that they would pose a threat to his base in Xu County while he was away at the frontline at Guandu, so he appointed Man Chong as the Administrator () of Runan Commandery to deal with Yuan Shao's retainers.\n\nUpon assuming office, Man Chong managed to induce some of Yuan Shao's retainers and their followers, numbering about 500 people, to surrender. He then led his troops to attack and destroy over 20 strongholds, lured the remaining retainers into a trap and killed over 10 of them. Runan Commandery was thus pacified. During his tenure, Man Chong gained control over 20,000 households, drafted about 2,000 men into military service, and implemented the \"tuntian\" policy in the commandery.\n\nIn 208, Man Chong led his troops from Runan Commandery to join Cao Cao on a military campaign to conquer Jing Province and attack the rival warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei. After Cao Cao retreated back to the north following his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209, he appointed Man Chong as acting General of Vehement Might () and ordered him to remain behind in Jing Province to defend Dangyang. However, after Cao Cao's forces lost the Battle of Jiangling against Sun Quan's forces, Cao Cao ordered Man Chong to abandon Dangyang and return to his previous post in Runan Commandery. The Han imperial court awarded Man Chong the title of a Secondary Marquis ().\n\nIn 219, Liu Bei's general Guan Yu led his forces to attack Fancheng (樊城, present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was guarded by Cao Ren, one of Cao Cao's cousins and trusted generals. At the time, Man Chong was in Fancheng to assist Cao Ren in resisting Guan Yu's attack. They were thrown into a dangerous situation when heavy rains caused flooding in the region and parts of Fancheng's walls began to crumble. To make matters worse, the flood destroyed the reinforcements led by Cao Cao's general Yu Jin, who surrendered to the enemy. Guan Yu kept pressing the attack on Fancheng all this while.\n\nSomeone suggested to Cao Ren to abandon Fancheng and escape while there was still time, since Guan Yu's forces had not completely surrounded Fancheng yet. Man Chong disagreed and said, \"The floodwaters may be flowing very fast, but the flood might not last long. Guan Yu had already sent a detachment of troops from his army to station at Jia County (郟縣). There is already much panic and fear among the people living in the lands south of Xu County (許縣). Guan Yu doesn't dare to advance further because he's worried that his base (in southern Jing Province) will come under attack. If we abandon Fancheng and leave, we'll end up losing all the territories south of the river. Sir, you should continue to hold up here.\" Cao Ren agreed with him. Man Chong drowned his horse and pledged to stay with the soldiers in Fancheng to the end.\n\nWhen Xu Huang, another of Cao Cao's generals, showed up at Fancheng with reinforcements, Man Chong joined him in attacking Guan Yu and succeeded in breaking the siege on Fancheng. As a reward for his efforts, the Han imperial court promoted Man Chong from a secondary marquis to a village marquis under the title \"Marquis of Anchang Village\" ().\n\nFollowing Cao Cao's death in 220, Man Chong continued serving under his son and successor, Cao Pi, who usurped the throne from Emperor Xian later that year, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the emperor. After his coronation, Cao Pi promoted Man Chong to General Who Spreads Martial Might ().\n\nSometime between 220 and 222, Man Chong participated in two battles against Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, founded by Cao Cao's old rival Sun Quan. In the first battle, he defeated Wu forces at Jiangling (江陵; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). After the battle, Cao Pi promoted him to General Who Calms the Waves () and ordered him to station at Xinye (新野; present-day Xinye County, Henan). In the second battle, Man Chong led the Wei army's vanguard force during a Wei campaign against Wu. The vanguard force, under his command, reached the Jing Lake () and established their position on the side of the lake directly across the enemy's side. Man Chong foresaw that the enemy would attempt to set fire to his camp at night as the winds were strong, so he warned his subordinates and put his troops on high alert. His prediction came true that night. Since they were prepared, Man Chong and his troops successfully repelled the attack and defended their position. As a reward for his contributions, Man Chong was promoted from a village marquis to a district marquis under the title \"Marquis of Nan District\" ().\n\nIn 222, Cao Pi granted Man Chong imperial authority and awarded him a ceremonial axe. Two years later, he promoted Man Chong to General of the Vanguard ().\n\nFollowing Cao Pi's death in 226, his son Cao Rui succeeded him as the emperor of Wei. After his coronation, Cao Rui elevated Man Chong from the status of a district marquis to a county marquis under the title \"Marquis of Changyi\" (). In 228, he appointed Man Chong as the Inspector () of Yu Province.\n\nIn the spring of 228, defectors from Wei's rival state, Wu, claimed that Wu forces were preparing to attack the territories north of the Yangtze River, with the Wu emperor Sun Quan personally leading his forces. Man Chong deduced that the Wu forces were deliberately spreading misinformation and that their true target was Xiyang County (西陽縣; southwest of present-day Guangshan County, Henan), so he gave orders to strengthen the defences at Xiyang County. When Sun Quan found out, he had no choice but to call off the attack.\n\nIn the autumn of the same year, Cao Rui ordered the general Cao Xiu to lead troops from Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui) to Hefei, and Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei). Man Chong wrote a memorial to the emperor: \"Cao Xiu may be wise and decisive, but he has little experience in battle. The route that he is taking has a lake behind it and the river beside it. It is easy to advance but difficult to retreat. Military leaders tend to avoid travelling across such terrain if possible. If he is going into Wuqiangkou (無彊口), he should be well-prepared.\" Before Man Chong's memorial reached Cao Rui, however, Cao Xiu and his army had already entered Wuqiangkou, where Wu forces blocked the path and forced them to turn back. As they came under attack while retreating, Zhu Ling showed up with reinforcements to cover their retreat. The Wu forces became fearful upon seeing the arrival of Wei reinforcements, so they retreated as well. Cao Xiu thus managed to escape with his life.\n\nAfter Cao Xiu died later in 228, Man Chong, as General of the Vanguard, was ordered to replace him as the supervisor of military operations in Yang Province. As Man Chong had gained much support from the locals during his tenure as the Administrator of Runan Commandery, the people in Runan Commandery wanted to follow him when they learnt that he had been reassigned to Yang Province. Man Chong could not stop them. A military officer wrote to the emperor Cao Rui, seeking permission to execute the local leader as a warning to the people to stop making things difficult for Man Chong. However, Cao Rui did not approve and, as a compromise, he allowed Man Chong to bring only 1,000 people with him to Yang Province while the rest had to remain in Runan Commandery.\n\nIn 230, Cao Rui promoted Man Chong to General Who Attacks the East (). In the winter of that year, after receiving intelligence that the Wu emperor Sun Quan was planning to attack Hefei, Man Chong immediately requested for reinforcements from Yan and Yu provinces and stepped up the defences at Hefei. When Sun Quan heard about it, he called off the attack on Hefei. Man Chong knew that Sun Quan was only pretending to retreat to put him off guard, and would come back to attack Hefei again once the reinforcements left. He was proven right as Sun Quan attacked Hefei after about 10 days. However, as Hefei was well-defended, Sun Quan's forces could not breach the walls and had to withdraw.\n\nIn 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu () secretly sent a messenger to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey his desire to defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: \"As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over.\" Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong and asked him to send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: \"It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, they will not be able to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes.\"\n\nMan Chong was not on good terms with his colleague, Wang Ling, who spread rumours that Man Chong was addicted to alcohol, physically unfit for his job, and unruly and defiant. When the rumours reached the Wei imperial capital Luoyang, an official Guo Mou () suggested to the emperor to summon Man Chong to Luoyang and see if the rumours were true, as opposed to immediately removing Man Chong from office. Cao Rui heeded the suggestion. When Man Chong met the emperor, he appeared to be in good health and remained sober after consuming one \"dan\" of alcohol. Cao Rui thus concluded that the rumours were untrue and ordered Man Chong to return to his post. Man Chong, however, wanted to remain in Luoyang so he repeatedly sought permission from Cao Rui but was denied. Cao Rui told him, \"In the past, Lian Po ate and drank heavily to show that he was in good health, while Ma Yuan turned his body to look backward while he was on horseback to show that he was still fit for battle. You aren't even old, yet you say you're old. Why don't you compare yourself with Lian Po and Ma Yuan? You should be thinking about defending the border and serving your country.\"\n\nBefore Man Chong left for Luoyang, he instructed his chief clerk, who was in charge during his absence, to not give Wang Ling command of any of his troops. Wang Ling, unable to get any troops from Man Chong's units, had to send his own subordinates and 700 soldiers from his own units to meet Sun Bu. As Man Chong foresaw, Sun Bu was indeed pretending to defect. Wang Ling's subordinates and 700 men fell into an ambush and suffered heavy casualties.\n\nIn 232, when the Wu general Lu Xun led troops to attack Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui), Man Chong's subordinates urged him to send reinforcements there. However, Man Chong refused and said, \"Lujiang may be small, but its troops are well-trained and seasoned in battle. They can definitely defend Lujiang for some time. Besides, as the enemy has left their ships and travelled 200 \"li\" deep into our territory, their rear must be unguarded. We should use this opportunity to lure them deeper into our territory and wait for an opportunity to strike back. Let's allow them to push further in. By the time they want to retreat, it'll be too late for them.\" He then assembled his troops and waited at Yangyikou (). When the Wu forces heard about it, they immediately retreated that night. At the time, as the Wu emperor Sun Quan was eager to conquer Yang Province, he came up with new plans for invasion every year.\n\nIn 233, Man Chong wrote a memorial to the Wei imperial court, seeking permission to move the troops out of Hefei and station them in an area some 30 \"li\" west of the city, and build a fortress there. His plan was meant to lure Wu forces to attack a weakly defended Hefei, cut off their retreat route, and use the opportunity to destroy them. Jiang Ji, a Wei official, disagreed with Man Chong's plan because he believed that the Wu forces would see the drastic reduction in Hefei's defences as a sign of weakness on Wei's part, and become more emboldened to attack and pillage the city. The Wei emperor Cao Rui thought that Jiang Ji made sense so he did not approve Man Chong's idea.\n\nMan Chong sent in another memorial to argue that his plan would work because it would mislead the Wu forces into thinking that they were giving up on Hefei and lure them deeper into Wei territory, where they would lose their advantage in naval warfare and become more vulnerable. He also quoted lines from \"The Art of War\" in his memorial to support his point on using deception to lure the enemy into a trap. Zhao Zi (), a Wei official, supported Man Chong's idea and managed to convince Cao Rui to approve it.\n\nLater that year, the Wu emperor Sun Quan personally led his forces to attack Hefei and wanted to besiege the newly constructed fortress, known as Xincheng (新城; literally \"new fortress/city\"), at the west of Hefei. However, as Xincheng was too far from the riverbank, the Wu forces were hesitant to launch an all-out attack. They remained on their ships on the river for about 20 days.\n\nMan Chong gathered his subordinates and told them, \"Sun Quan knows that I have moved the troops out of Hefei. He'll definitely want to put on a show of might so that he can brag about how powerful his army is. Although he doesn't have the courage to push further in and attack Xincheng, he'll definitely send his troops ashore just to show off how big his army is.\" He then ordered 6,000 troops to lie in ambush in Hefei and wait for the Wu soldiers to come ashore. As Man Chong predicted, Sun Quan did order his troops to go ashore and put on a show of might. When that happened, the 6,000 troops in Hefei launched a sudden and fierce attack on them. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while some drowned as they tried to flee back to their ships.\n\nIn 234, Sun Quan personally led a 100,000-strong army to attack Xincheng, Hefei. Man Chong recruited dozens of fierce warriors to make torches from tree branches, douse them with oil, and take advantage of the winds to set fire to the Wu army's siege engines and destroy them. Sun Quan's nephew, Sun Tai, was killed in the battle. Sun Quan withdrew his forces.\n\nIn the spring of 235, Sun Quan sent a few thousand of his soldiers and their families to farm on the north banks of the Yangtze as part of a \"tuntian\" programme. By early autumn, Man Chong deduced that it was the harvest season, so the Wu soldiers and their families would be out in the fields collecting the harvest, and their strongholds would thus be undefended. He then sent his troops to launch a surprise attack on them, destroying their strongholds and burning down their crops. Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Man Chong and award the spoils of war to Man Chong's troops.\n\nSometime between 22 March and 20 April 239, Man Chong retired from military service in Hefei and returned to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, where he served as Grand Commandant () in the imperial court. Throughout his life, he did not accumulate wealth for his family and was quite poor in his old age. The Wei emperor Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Man Chong for his loyalty and dedication, and award him 10 \"qing\" of land, 500 \"hu\" of grain and 200,000 coins. The total number of taxable households in Man Chong's marquisate increased over the years until it reached 9,600. One of his sons and one of his grandsons were enfeoffed as village marquises.\n\nMan Chong died sometime between 17 April and 18 May 242 during the reign of Cao Rui's adopted son and successor, Cao Fang. He was honoured with the posthumous title \"Marquis Jing\" () after death.\n\nChen Shou, who wrote Man Chong's biography in the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", appraised him as follows: \"Man Chong was ambitious, resolute, courageous and resourceful.\"\n\nMan Chong had at least three sons and one daughter. He and his son Man Wei and grandsons Man Changwu and Man Fen were all described as eight \"chi\" tall (≈1.84 metres).\n\n\nMan Chong is a playable character in the ninth instalment of the \"Dynasty Warriors\" video game series by Koei Tecmo.\n\n\n"}

It was controlled by the Consolidated Railway of Connecticut. In May 1901 the company was renamed to the Springfield and Eastern Street Railway. An extension to the Springfield Street Railway in Ludlow opened on September 17, 1901, and a line to Brimfield opened in July 1907.\n\nOn September 1, 1905, the Springfield Street Railway leased the Springfield and Eastern. In 1906 the S&E, along with most other Massachusetts properties of the Consolidated Railway (including the Springfield Street Railway), was sold to the New England Investment and Security Company.\n\nBy 1927 buses had replaced the trolleys.\n\nThe original line ran between Palmer and Monson, and was later extended to South Monson. Most of this was over the present Route 32, except in two places. In Palmer, instead of crossing the Boston and Albany Railroad east of downtown with current Route 32, the line continued with Main Street, crossing the tracks downtown. Additionally, the tracks used a private right-of-way in North Monson, crossing the New London Northern Railroad at Bunyan Road.\n\nThe line from Palmer to Ludlow followed US 20 out the west end of Palmer. Just before the crossing of the Quaboag River, the tracks split to cross the river north of the road, and then crossed to the south side of the road onto a private right-of-way just north of the Boston and Albany Railroad. The part of this across the river has since become a realignment of the road. Near the Palmer/Wilbraham town line, the line left the north side of the B&A and returned to the road, continuing west to the border with Springfield, across the Chicopee River from Ludlow. At the end of this route, the road now known as Old Boston Road, Stony Hill Road and River Road was used.\n\nThe line from Palmer to Brimfield split from the Monson line just south of where it entered current Route 32. From there it ran on a private right-of-way cross-country to a point on US 20 at the split with Monson Road. The part of this alignment in Brimfield has since become a realignment of US 20. From there, the tracks continued along current US 20 to Brimfield center.\n\nThe line from Palmer to Ware headed north out of Palmer on present Route 32, splitting just before Palmer Center onto High Street. It continued north along River Street to Whipples, continuing on a private right-of-way (part of which is now River Street) back to Route 32, which it used to Ware. From Ware, a line continued along Route 32 to Gilbertville, with a branch heading east along Route 9 to the Warren, Brookfield and Spencer Street Railway at the present merge with Route 67 in West Brookfield. Some or all of these continuations past Ware may have been built and operated by the WB&S or another company.\n\nA branch of the line to Ware turned west, continuing on High Street past River Street. It used Commercial Street and Main Street through Thorndike, ending at Three Rivers. A branch of that split at Four Corners, running north on present Route 181 to Bondsville and its Central Massachusetts Railroad station.\n\n"}

There is no limit on the number of terms a person may serve in the office.\n\nThe current Attorney General, Democrat Josh Stein, assumed office on January 1, 2017.\n\nAttorney General's duties include providing legal representation and advice to all state agencies.\n\nThe parameters of that duty have been the subject of some debate, when, for example, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that state Attorneys General should not squander their state's resources in defense of laws they know to be unconstitutional. By statute, in defense of the public interest, the Attorney General may initiate legal action or intervene in proceedings before any courts, regulatory officers, agencies or bodies — either state or federal — on behalf of the state's agencies and citizens. The Attorney General also renders legal opinions, either formally or informally, upon all questions of law submitted by the General Assembly, the Governor, or any other state officer. Attorney General opinions may be viewed online.\n\nThe title \"Attorney General\" was used in colonial North Carolina as early as 1677, when George Durant was appointed by Governor John Jenkins. In theory, colonial Attorneys General represented the British Attorney General, who represented the Crown.\n\nThe first North Carolina Constitution (1776) established the office of state Attorney General. Like the state Governor, the Attorney General was at that time elected by the legislature, the North Carolina General Assembly. The first Attorney General for the independent state of North Carolina was Waightstill Avery, who served from 1777 to 1779. Two of Avery's successors, James Iredell and Alfred Moore, both served on the United States Supreme Court. Since 1868, the Attorney General has been elected by the people. At the same time, the Attorney General became a voting member of the Council of State, rather than the legal advisor to the council.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Justice was created by the legislature in the early 1970s.\n\nOccupants of the office often run for Governor of North Carolina or U.S. Senator, some of them successfully, such as former Governor Mike Easley, former Senator Robert B. Morgan, and the current Governor, Roy Cooper.\n\nThe following is a list of Attorneys General of North Carolina and their term of office:\n\n"}

When he was 16, he and his three younger brothers (Rudy, Ronnie and Vernon) formed The Isley Brothers and toured the gospel circuit. Following the death of Vernon in a road accident, the brothers decided to try their hand at doo-wop and moved to New York to find a recording deal. Between 1957 and 1959, the Isleys would record for labels such as Teenage and Mark X. In 1959, they signed with RCA Records after a scout spotted the trio's energetic live performance.\n\nO'Kelly and his brothers co-wrote their first significant hit, \"Shout\". While the original version only peaked at the top 50 of the Hot 100, subsequent versions helped the song sell over a million copies. Later moving on to other labels including Scepter and Motown, the brothers would have hits with \"Twist & Shout\" in 1962 and \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\". In 1959, the Isley family had relocated to Englewood, New Jersey where Kelly stayed with his mother and younger siblings.\n\nIn 1969, the brothers left Motown and started their own label, T-Neck Records, where they would write the majority of their recordings, including \"It's Your Thing\". Kelly and his brother Rudy began to take some lead spots on the group's albums starting with the \"It's Our Thing\" album in 1969. The track, \"Black Berries\", from their \"\" album, was dedicated to Kelly, who Ron would always quote him as saying \"the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\". That saying had been originated by Harlem Renaissance novelist Wallace Thurman in the 1929 novel, \"The Blacker the Berry\". After the inclusion of younger brothers Ernie and Marvin and brother-in-law Chris Jasper, Kelly, Rudy and Ron didn't write as much as they did in the past but in an agreement shared parts of the composition credits as they owned the songs' publishing.\n\nKelly Isley during the Isleys' 1970s heyday was usually photographed wearing a cowboy hat and Western type of clothing. According to his brother Ernie, it was Kelly who discovered a homeless Jimi Hendrix after hearing of Hendrix's talents as a guitarist and helped him get a job with the brothers' band and allowed to live in his mother's house. In 1985 the brothers released the \"Masterpiece\" album. It is Kelly who sings most of the lead of the Phil Collins ballad, \"If Leaving Me Is Easy\", on the album with Ron backing him up. Kelly's last appearance as member of the Isley Brothers was in 1986 on the song \"Good Hands\" from the Wildcats soundtrack.\n\nA heavyset man, Kelly contracted cancer and lost weight, which was shown on the group's album cover of \"Masterpiece\". On March 31, 1986, O'Kelly suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 48 in his Alpine, New Jersey home leaving behind two sons, Frank and Doug. He is buried in George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nThe Isley Brothers' follow-up record following Kelly's death, \"Smooth Sailin'\", was dedicated to him and featured their tribute song, \"Send A Message\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1990323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990323", "title": "Olhão", "text": "Olhão\n\nOlhão (), officially known as Olhão da Restauração, is a municipality and urban community in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. The population in 2011 was 45,396, in an area of 130.86 km². Located near the regional capital Faro, it is a fishing port, home of the \"Bela\" brand sardines and Conserveira do Sul's Manná range of processed fish products. Along with Faro, Loulé, and Tavira, Olhão forms a conurbation with the city of Faro, from the eastern and central Algarve.\n\nSince pre-history, Olhão has had vestiges of human occupation, although the oldest written record dates only from 1378, referring to a place called \"Olham\". The estuary and abundance of water were decisive factors that influenced fishermen, at the beginning of the 17th century, to congregate along the beach of Olhão. The settlement developed even as officials in Faro discouraged concentration along this coast. Yet, the growth of activity here was impulsed by the protection, after the middle of the 17th century, offered by the Fortress of São Lourenço, which guarded the coast and entrance to the estuary, discouraging attacks from corsairs.\n\nThe incremental growth of the fishery along the coast and sea, and commercial enterprises associated their growth, provoked a leap in population. As a result, in 1695, the residents requested from the Bishop of Faro, that Olhão should be de-annexed from the parish of Quelfes: resulting in the formation of the parish of \"Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Olhão\".\n\nDuring the French occupation of the Algarve, during the Peninsular Wars, Olhão was notable for one of the few public uprisings against the occupiers, occurring on 16 June 1808. This revolt culminated in the expulsion of the French from Olhão and, as a result, from the rest of the Algarve. It was during this period, that a month later, a small group of 17 men embarked to Brazil on a \"caique\" (a small sailing vessel) named \"Bom Sucesso\", in the hope of promoting the Algarvean success to the Portuguese Court. The crew brought an ex-official statement describing the audacious attitude of the Olhanese revolt. A replica of the boat is moored at Olhão's waterfront.\n\nIn recompense, a regal charter (with the force of law) was signed by the Prince Regent John to distinguish Olhão, and its inhabitants, transforming the location from a locality to town, and ordering that it be referred to as \"Vila de Olhão da Restauração\". The transformation, resulted in the creation of a new municipality, with local autonomy, beginning in 1826. In this year, the municipal council hall was erected and a \"juiz de fora\" was instituted to preside over the councilmen.\n\nIn 1835, the parish of Moncarapacho began to function as a suburb of Olhão, and in the following year, the municipal council took control of the parishes of Olhão, Quelfes, Pechão and part of Moncarapacho.\n\nA judicial division of Portugal in 1874, resulted in the definitive demarcation of the municipality of Olhão, constituted by the five parishes of Olhão, Moncarapacho, Quelfes, Pechão and Fuseta.\n\nOver time the small town of fishermen grew into an economic, social and urban centre, resulting in its elevation in city in 1985. In recent years, it has also developed a growing tourist industry.\n\nThe municipality is confronted on the east and north by the municipality of Tavira, to the west by the municipality of Faro and in the south by the Atlantic Ocean. It is located within the morphological sub-regions of the Barrocal and coast. In the Barrocal, the municipality is limited in the north by the old massif and south with the sand-stones of the Mesozoic. These lines, follow an ancient beach and coast, justifying the existence of the sedimentary deposits (sand-stones) over the ancient massif. The coast, constituted by a sub-zone of more recent materials, Quaternary or Neogenic in age. These deposits came to rest over sand-stones and marls that comprise the coastal Mesocenozoic, a young relief, that is little accented, aided by a platform that includes superficial lavas.\n\nAll of the coastal littoral of the municipality belongs to the Nature Park of Ria Formosa, one of the more important humid zones in Europe, considered in 2004, by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a humid zone of world interest.\n\nThe Nature Park of Ria Formosa was instituted in 1987, by Decree Law 373/87 (9 September), with the objective of protecting and conserving this river system, and in particular the flora and fauna, including species of migratory bird and their habitats. The Nature Park extends into the municipalities of Loulé, Faro, Olhão, Tavira and Vila Real de Santo António, covering an area of 18400 hectares, for along the coast, from Ancão until Manta Rota, covering a great variety of habitats: barrier islands, marshes, banks of mud and sand, dunes, salt marshes, freshwater ponds and brackish waterways, forests and agricultural areas.\nIn the municipality of Olhão, the island of Armona is included in the barrier islands of the Ria Formosa: this includes the beaches of Fuseta Mar and Armona Mar.\n\nThe Algarve is an area that presents a climate typically Mediterranean, characterized by warm and dry seasons during five months of the year, with median daily temperatures around 22.5 °C and gentle winters, with scarce precipitation and daily median temperatures around 12.4 °C.\n\nIn a general way, the municipality presents a temperate humid Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers and mild winters. The precipitation is distributed in an irregular fashion throughout the year, while concentrating in the months between autumn and spring. The climate is not homogeneously distributed throughout the region; the maritime influence gives way from the littoral area to the interior, turning the climate warmer and drier, and simultaneously more rainy.\n\nThe municipality of Olhão has an area of approximately , with a resident population that includes 42,272 inhabitants (approximately 31,100 within the city of Olhão). Olhão is divided into an interior territory and the island of Armona.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n"}

With Dahl's assistance, a series of gremlin characters were developed, and while pre-production had begun, the film project was eventually abandoned, in part because the studio could not establish the precise rights of the \"gremlin\" story, and in part because the British Air Ministry was heavily involved in the production because Dahl, who was on leave from his wartime Washington posting, insisted on final approval of script and production.\n\nThe story concerns mischievous mythical creatures, the Gremlins of the title, often invoked by Royal Air Force pilots as an explanation of mechanical troubles and mishaps. In Dahl's book, the gremlins' motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge of the destruction of their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the gremlins as they parachute into the water that they should join forces against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other.\n\nEventually, the gremlins are re-trained by the Royal Air Force to repair rather than sabotage aircraft, and restore Gus to active flight status after a particularly severe crash. The book also contains picturesque details about the ordinary lives of gremlins: baby gremlins, for instance, are known as widgets, and females as fifinellas, a name taken from the great \"flying\" filly racehorse Fifinella, that won both The Derby and Epsom Oaks in 1916, the year Dahl was born.\n\nThe publication of \"The Gremlins\" by Random House consisted of a 50,000 run for the U.S. market with Dahl ordering 50 copies for himself as promotional material, handing them out to everyone he knew, including the British Ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax, and the First Lady of the U.S. Eleanor Roosevelt, who loved to read it to her grandchildren. The book was considered an international success with 30,000 more sold in Australia but initial efforts to reprint the book were precluded by a wartime paper shortage. Reviewed in major publications, Dahl was considered a writer-of-note and his appearances in Hollywood to follow up with the film project were met with notices in Hedda Hopper's columns.\n\nFacing copyright problems and realising that the Air Ministry's \"Clause 12\" in the original film contract would restrict the studio, Walt Disney, who had a personal interest in \"The Gremlins\", reluctantly began to \"wind down\" the project. By August 1943, Disney had even reconsidered an animated \"short\" based on \"The Gremlins\" and indicated to Dahl by correspondence that further work would not continue. After a year of story conferences and related research, Dahl realised that his book would be the only tangible product emanating from the aborted film.\n\nThe story of gremlins appeared in Issues #33-#41 of \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" published by Walt Disney Productions between June 1943 and February 1944; it contained a nine-episode series of short, silent stories featuring a Gremlin Gus as their star. The first was drawn by Vivie Risto and the rest of them by Walt Kelly. This served as their introduction to the comic book audience. These comics were subsequently reprinted in 1987 by Gladstone Publishing Ltd.\n\nA special edition of the book was produced to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the United States Air Force and was distributed exclusively through the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. The USAF special edition featured a unique dust jacket that bore the commemorative seal of the 60th USAF Anniversary. The inside flap of the dust jacket featured a brief history of the book's role in improving morale for airmen and their families. The initial distribution of the USAF 60th Anniversary commemorative edition sold out at all participating AAFES locations on the first day of sale.\n\nUsed copies of the first edition book are highly prized and sought after by collectors of both Roald Dahl's works and Disney's; these copies may be valued anywhere between US$100 and US$10,000.\n\n\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", a 1963 \"Twilight Zone\" episode, starring William Shatner, is a homage to the legend of gremlins, one being seen dismantling an airliner during flight. The role was played by John Lithgow in the .\n\nIn the book \"Myth Conceptions,\" from the MythAdventures series, Robert Asprin describes a gremlin as a small, blue-skinned creature that has a tendency to vanish when the viewer's attention is distracted.\n\nThe 1984 film \"Gremlins\", produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante, is loosely inspired by Dahl's characters, featuring evil and destructive monsters which mutate from small furry creatures.\n\nIn September 2006, Dark Horse Comics published \"The Gremlins: The Lost Walt Disney Production,\" a faithfully restored and updated version of \"The Gremlins\" including an introduction by acclaimed film historian Leonard Maltin as well as creating a series of Gremlin-inspired toys and figurines, that were patterned after the original Dahl-inspired characters as well as a comic sequel mini-series in which the grandson of pilot Gus meets the Gremlins when inheriting his grandfather's house in England.\n\nThe Gremlins appear in the \"Epic Mickey\" franchise as tiny helpers of Mickey Mouse. Their leader Gus (voiced by Bob Joles in the first game and Cary Elwes in the second) serves as a conscience figure to Mickey (as Jiminy Cricket is to Pinocchio). Unlike in the book, the Gremlins can teleport.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The genre evolved in the early 1980s from combining the drum beats of hardcore punk with the guitar style of the new wave of British heavy metal. It emerged partially as a reaction to the more conventional and widely acceptable glam metal, a less aggressive, pop music-infused heavy metal subgenre which appeared simultaneously.\n\nFour American bands, Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer, are credited with popularizing the genre, earning them the title of the \"Big Four of Thrash\". In Germany, Destruction, Kreator, Sodom, and Tankard, led the Teutonic thrash metal scene, garnering the nickname \"The Big Four of Teutonic Thrash\". The Clash of the Titans tour, which featured Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, and Suicidal Tendencies, is considered to be the genre's pinnacle, after which thrash metal saw a decline in popularity throughout the 1990s. Thrash metal has seen a resurgence in recent times, with many of the older bands returning to their roots with their new releases. A new generation of thrash metal bands emerged in the early 2000s, drawing lyrical and visual inspiration from the older groups.\n\nThrash metal was an inspiration for later extreme genres such as death metal and black metal. This list also includes certain bands which belong to the first wave of black metal. These bands essentially played thrash metal with a heavy emphasis on Satanic and occult themes in the lyrics and imagery. Over the years, thrash metal has developed a few subgenres of its own, such as crossover thrash and groove metal.\n"}

By his teen years, he was singing as member of The Isley Brothers with Kelly, Ronnie and Vernon. In 1957, following Vernon's death, the remaining three elder Isleys moved to New York to seek a recording deal, later recording for smaller labels until landing a deal with RCA Records in 1959 where they wrote, recorded and released their first significant recording, \"Shout\". By the summer of that year, the Isley family had moved from Cincinnati to a home in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nFollowing \"Shout\", the brothers recorded for other labels with modest success with exceptions including the top 40 hit, \"Twist & Shout\" and the Motown hit, \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\". In the 1960s, Rudy and his brothers founded the T-Neck Records label to promote their recordings. Following their split with Motown, they reactivated the label and scored a Grammy-winning smash with \"It's Your Thing\" in 1969. While Ron Isley was the prominent lead singer of the group, Rudy did record a few lead vocals on some Isley Brothers songs, following the reactivation of T-Neck. After the group reorganized into a band after the inclusion of younger brothers Ernie and Marvin Isley and in-law Chris Jasper, Rudy was known for wearing hats and fur-attired clothing and was also known for carrying a cane. Rudy would share lead vocals with his brothers Ron and Kelly on hits such as \"Fight the Power\" and \"Livin' in the Life\". Rudy also sung full lead on other tunes such as \"You Still Feel the Need\" from the album, \"Harvest for the World\", and their 1979 hit, \"It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)\".

It is named after nearby Mount Tamalpais, which rises almost above Mill Valley.\n\nTamalpais High School is the original campus of the Tamalpais Union High School District and the second public high school in Marin County. As of 2007, Tam's attendance area includes the cities of Mill Valley and Sausalito, the nearby unincorporated areas of Marin City, Strawberry and Tamalpais-Homestead Valley, and the West Marin communities of Muir Beach, Bolinas and Stinson Beach. Mill Valley School District is the largest feeder for Tam, followed by the Sausalito Marin City School District and the Bolinas-Stinson Union School District.\n\nTamalpais Union High School District was founded in 1907, to serve students from the Mill Valley Elementary and Sausalito Elementary School Districts who had previously commuted to San Rafael to continue their education. Tamalpais Union High School held its first classes on August 4, 1908, in tent-like structures. The school opened with 70 students: 40 freshmen, 21 sophomores, five juniors, and four seniors. Ernest E. Wood took the lead in founding the District and was the first principal. In its second year, there were six teachers, 100 students, and 300 volumes in the school library. By the 1913–1914 school year, enrollment had increased to 175, with eight faculty; the library holdings had grown to 650 books plus subscriptions to eight magazines and two newspapers. E.E. Wood remained principal for 36 years; he retired in 1944.\n\nKnown in its early years as Tamalpais Polytechnic High School, Tam was a comprehensive high school from its beginning, with a curriculum that included both academic subjects and technical training. In an interview with the local newspaper the year before he died, Principal Wood said, \"I believe the students learned by doing things. I believe in the philosophy of students getting in and doing work and accomplishing things.\" Architecture students designed the first building on campus, and students built several structures there over the years.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, Principal Frank Gold and a group of parents formed the nonprofit Tam High Foundation to raise funds for support of the school. The Foundation raised $60,000 its first year, increasing annual funding to $360,000 by 2007–2008. The foundation awards academic grants of up to $10,000 to teachers and administrators.\n\nTam's first 100 years, 1908 to 2008, were widely recognized in local media. The Tam Centennial Committee, which included the principal, alumni, parents, retired faculty, and others, began meeting in 2006. The centennial celebration began with kickoff events on Homecoming Weekend in September 2007. Several events were scheduled for the year, including a Tam Oral History Project, a centennial documentary, and a celebration over the 2008 Memorial Day weekend.\n\nInitially consisting of only a couple of tents on a shore front campus that allowed students to take their boats to school, the Tamalpais campus was fully developed over the years, but has seen its share of wear and tear. Following a 2004 bond measure, the campus underwent renovations to some of its nearly century-old buildings. The oldest building, Wood Hall, reopened in late August 2005. Wood Hall houses the school's administrative offices.\n\nThe 2005–2006 academic year was delayed by five days when unhealthy levels of mold were discovered in the walls of Keyser Hall. The building was closed, and portable classrooms were used instead of Keyser's 17 classrooms. The mold grew due to runoff from the hillside the building was situated on. Keyser Hall was demolished during the summer of 2006; a state-of-the-art replacement structure, also named Keyser Hall, was opened in January 2009.\nSchool administrators are consulting with architects about the construction of a handicapped elevator in front of the school's most recognizable building, Wood Hall. Architects unveiled a plan for a four-story elevator tower in front of the school's signature archway, complete with a bridge to take handicapped students into the building. Staff were shocked at the drastic proposal, which would be costly and would have an extensive impact on many of the campus' most well-known architectural features. An elevator of some sort may be necessary to comply with handicapped accessibility laws. Administrators have formed a committee to look into alternative ways to provide that accessibility.\n\n2014–2015\n\nTam has competed in the Marin County Athletic League (MCAL) since the league was established in 1959. The MCAL is in the Marin-Sonoma-Mendocino Conference, North Coast Section (NCS), of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). Prior to the 1959 realignment, Tam was a member of the old North Bay League. In the 1920s, the NBL included Analy High School, Napa High School, Petaluma High School, San Rafael High School, Santa Rosa High School, St. Helena High School, and Vallejo High School.\n\nThrough the 1940s and early 1950s, Tam played against NBL teams from Healdsburg, Napa, San Rafael, Santa Rosa, and Vallejo; non-league opponents included Analy and Petaluma. In the 1950s, Drake and Marin Catholic joined the League.\n\nThe MCAL offers competition in 21 sports , including baseball, cross country, football, softball, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling. Separate teams for boys and girls compete in basketball, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, volleyball, and water polo.

In Spring 2008, the Boys Golf team took third in the NCS, with a 3.57 GPA.\n\nFive Tam coaches have been recognized as Honor Coaches at the North Coast Section: Bruce Grant (girls track, 1982); Janis Villasenor Wood (girls track, 1985); Beth Juri (boys volleyball, 1997); and Don Smith (softball, 2003). Ed Chavez, long-time basketball coach at Tam, was named Honor Coach while coaching tennis at Branson after retiring from the Tam District.\n\nTam baseball had what was considered one of the lower teams in the MCAL. In 2009 Tam hired former Redwood High School pitcher Mike Terry to take over the program. He completely changed the mentality of the program. He instilled a real desire to win in the program. After missing the playoffs in 2009 and 2010 the Hawks made it as the last seed and went out in the first round of the MCAL playoffs. In 2014 Scott Osder took over the program coming from Southern California. His Competitive nature brought Tamalpias High to its first NCS Championship in 85 years. Key players included Max Gamboa, Bret Bowyer, Mason Collins, and Alex Davis who all went on to play College Baseball.\n\nJunior Dan Milechman won the 2009 State Division IV Championship, covering the 3.1-mile course in 15:37. Milechman was NCS Division IV Individual Champion in 2008 and 2009.\n\nAlthough Tam has never won a varsity football championship at the section level, which NCS held from 1919 to 1930 and from 1975 to present, the Fall 1966 Tamalpais Indians team set records at the league, state, and national levels. In its second year under coach Willie Hector, 1957 graduate of Tam and former NFL player, the 1966 Indians had a 4–1–1 record in the MCAL and 6–2–1 overall. After sophomore quarterback Donny Mackin broke his wrist in the opening league game, he was replaced by senior Steve Woodward, in his only season playing MCAL football. In his first game as starting quarterback, against Novato High School, Woodward set the state record for passing, at , while split-end Mike Biber set the league record with 19 receptions. Woodward's passing record stood for 21 years, until a Southern California quarterback passed for in 1987. Tam's total offense of in the Novato game set the state record and was the second-highest ever recorded in the nation. Tam's state record only stood for one year, until tiny Happy Camp High School gained against the even smaller McCloud High School.\n\nFifty years later, following the 2016 season, Tam's big day ranked fifth in California and is tied for twelfth in the nation.\n\nSince the current brackets were established in 2008, Tam's varsity football team has competed in Division III and has qualified for NCS playoffs seven times with the following results: lost 35–14 to Bishop O'Dowd High School in the first round in 2008; defeated El Cerrito High School 33–13 in their first round in 2009, and lost to Alhambra High School of Martinez in the second round 34–13; lost 40–21 to Encinal High School in the first round in 2011; lost 35–7 to Encinal High School in the first round in 2012; lost 64–8 in the first round in 2013 to the eventual Champion, El Cerrito High School; lost 50–6 in the first round in 2014 to the eventual runner-up, Marin Catholic High School; and lost 55–7 to Analy High School in the first round in 2016.\n\nIn addition to the NCS championships won by the boys team in 2000 and the girls team in 2008.

They finished the season with a record of 20–3–3.\n\nThe 1999 boys varsity was the MCAL champion, finishing the season 14-0, the first undefeated season in the team's history. The boys varsity team also won the MCAL title in 2007 and 2011.\n\nOn October 23, 2008, the girls varsity tennis team won the 2008 MCAL championship for the first time in nine years, beating Marin Catholic 6-3 in the finals. The team was 16-6 for the season; it beat Redwood in the semifinals 5-4.\n\nOn November 15, 2008, Tam was upset by the Marin Catholic Wildcats 5-2 in the NCS Division II finals.\n\nTwo Tam milers have taken first place in California State Track Meets.

Tam had defeated Redlands East Valley High School of San Bernardino County to win the state championship. In Charlotte, competing against 44 other schools, Tam won all five rounds of the tournament, beating the previously undefeated team from Kauai High School in the finals. The members of the national championship team were Sandra Allen, Mackenzie Amara, Jason Finkelstein, Jessie Kavanagh, Courtney Khademi, Natalie Robinson, Kelly Stout, and Max Wertheimer.

He was honored by the Marin County Board of Education for 20 years of coaching the Mock Trial team. During his tenure, the team extended its winning steak for the county title to 23 consecutive years, and won three state championships and one national championship.\n\nTam High is the original home of the Conservatory Theatre Ensemble (CTE) (formerly Ensemble Theater Company (ETC)), formed by former student (Tam/Drake Class of 1952) and teacher Daniel Caldwell, notable alumni of which include Kathleen Quinlan, Michael Thomsett, Tupac Shakur, Beth Behrs, Bridgit Mendler, and Courtney Thorne-Smith. ETC expanded its presence to include Redwood High School and Drake High School in the mid-1980s. The Daniel Caldwell Performing Arts Center a new facility features a new multi-use theatre building as well as significant upgrades and renovations to Ruby Scott Auditorium. The Center was completed in 2006. (ETC was renamed the Conservatory Theatre Ensemble (CTE).)

The following year, 2001, musicians, artists, and dancers from the school visited Havana's art high schools and spent time creating art together with the Cuban students.\n\nIn 2013, the baseball and softball teams received permission to travel to Havana, Cuba to each play a three-game series against Cuban teams. Throughout the trip, the teams traveled the country and experienced many unique cultural opportunities including Festival Internacional del Cine Pobre and the Festival Internacional de la Trova. The boys finished with a 2–1 record and the girls swept with a 3–0 record. They were also accompanied by a Tam News journalist who filmed the experience and made a documentary about the experience and the students who attended.\n\nIn April 2010, students participating in the trip to France and the CTE trip to London were stranded for six days due to the travel disruptions caused by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano, Eyjafjallajökull. All students and staff returned to the United States safely and without incident.\n\nThe school's newspaper, the \"Tamalpais News\" has won awards from the National Scholastic Press Association and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. \"News\" staff won individual awards for Story of the Year from the NSPA in 1998 (2nd for features); 2009 (3rd Diversity); 2011 (5th News Story); 2013 (2nd Feature, 4th Diversity); and 2014 (1st Editorial/Opinion, 2nd Feature).

Actually Price wrote the song in 1951, as she thought the song described her friend, King, very well. King recorded the song and Stewart did the vocal. Price gave rights to the other two in exchange for publicity, as she felt she knew nothing about the music distribution business. The song did so well commercially that when Price wrote the song \"You Belong to Me\" the next year, she felt she could do better by ceding partial credit for authorship to King and Stewart than trying to publicize the song herself, so that song as well was credited to King, Stewart, and Price, though Price was the sole author.\n\nPee Wee King's recording was issued by RCA Victor as catalog number 21-0489 (78rpm) and 48-0489 (45 rpm). It first entered the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on October 21, 1951 and lasted 22 weeks, peaking at #3. It was his only crossover from the country genre to score on the pop chart. It appeared on the country charts on September 21, 1951 for 31 weeks, peaking at #1 and remaining there for 15 weeks.\nIt also topped the Australian charts in May 1952.\n\nThe next-best-known version was the recording by Arthur Godfrey, which was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39632. It entered the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on December 28, 1951 for 11 weeks, peaking at #12. The song was one side of a two-sided hit; the flip side, \"Dance Me Loose,\" also reached #12.\n\nThe Hawkshaw Hawkins version was released by King Records (USA) as catalog number 998, reached #7 on the country charts, having first charted on December 8, 1951. It lasted 4 weeks on the charts.\n\nHelen O'Connell released her recording on Capitol Records as catalog number 1837. It first appeared on the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart beginning December 7, 1951 and lasted 11 weeks, peaking at #16.\n\nThe version by Roberta Lee was issued by Decca Records, catalog number 27792, entered the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on December 7, 1951 and lasted 4 weeks on the chart, where it peaked at #28.\n\nThe Ralph Flanagan recording was issued by RCA Victor on 78 rpm as catalog number 21-4373 and 45 rpm as 47-4373. It first appeared on the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on January 18, 1952, for 2 weeks and peaked at #29.\n\nTiny Hill's version was released by Mercury Records as catalog number 5740. It entered the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on January 4, 1952 at #30, in its only week on the chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the song was called \"Slow Coach.\" The lyric was changed to fit the British title. Pee Wee King also recorded a version with that title. The major British versions recorded by Johnny Brandon and the Ray Ellington Quartet.\n\nYet another recording made by Pee Wee King used the title \"Slow Bloke\" (and appropriate lyric changes). This would seem to have been made for the British market (\"bloke\" being a British word) but since all other British versions (and the previously-mentioned King recording) use the title \"Slow Coach\" the actual reason for this recording is unclear. It is possible the record may have been intended for the Australian market where bloke is a common appellation.\n\nThis song was sampled for the song \"Punk\" by British singer Red Face in 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990377", "title": "Loulé", "text": "Loulé\n\nLoulé () is a municipality in the Portuguese Algarve, district of Faro. In 2011, the population had 70,622 inhabitants, in an area of approximately . The municipality has two principal cities: Loulé and Quarteira.\n\nHuman presence in the territory of Loulé remotes to the Later Paleolithic. The growth of the settlement of Loulé likely stemmed from the late Neolithic, when small bands began rotating agricultural crops and herds around numerous subterranean cavities in its proximity (specifically around Goldra, Esparguina and Matos da Nora). Within the following millennium, the settlements began to grow and intensify with spread of Mediterranean cultures, that progressively penetrated the southwestern part of the peninsula. This culminated in the arrival of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, who founded the first trading posts along the maritime coast, increasing fishing, prospecting for minerals and commercial activities.\n\nAfter the 2nd century Punic War, the Roman provided a new impulse to economic activities, expanding the canning industry, agriculture and exploration of copper and iron. In the urban area of Loulé, a sculpted altar to the Goddess Diana, the rustic villages of Clareanes and Apra, and necropolises suggested the extent of Roman occupation. In the 5th century, the Suevians and Vandals, and later the Visigoths, destroyed many of the vestiges of Roman Empire, adapting and assimilating these earlier models of settlement and the cultural experiences of the native populations.\n\nThe arrival of Muslim Arabs, in the 8th century, lead to the rise of the historic Al-'Ulya' (Loulé), consisting of a small \"almedina\" (\"fortified city\") under the reign of Niebla, under the command of Taifa Ibne Mafom. The second half of the 12th century was an epoch marked by great political and military instability, with internal dissensions across the Garb Andaluz, supported by military constructions. It is possible that Al-'Ulya' was fortified during this period. The remains of the primitive keep remain, practically intact, the Taipa tower (\"Torre da Vela\") situated along the old \"Rua da Corredora\" (today the \"Rua Engº Duarte Pacheco\").\n\nThe bell tower of Loulé St. Clemens Church (São Clemente) was originally a minaret of a former Muslim mosque. It is one of the few remaining Islamic religious architectural elements from the Arab Moor rule in Portugal. Located across the church is \"Jardim dos Amuados\", which is an old Arab Muslim cemetery.\n\nIn 1249, King D. Afonso III supported by D. Paio Peres Correia, Knight and Master of the Order of Santiago, conquered the castle from the Moors, and integrated into the possessions of the Portuguese Crown. The first foral (\"charter\") was issued to the settlement in 1266. A second foral was issued in 1269, to the southern suburbs of Mouraria with narrow winding streets and medieval toponyms, such as \"Rua da Mouraria\" and \"Rua dos Oleiros\". The consequences of the Christian Reconquista had a negative effect on the economy of Loulé and its region, which was dependent trade from northern Africa and Andalusia. King D. Denis ordered the establishment of a fair in Loulé, unique to the Algarve, that lasted 15 days in September: it was located in Rossio, in front of the Horta D’El Rei, alongside the \"Porta de Silves\". The new economy, based on agriculture, supported by bartering across regions was insufficient to augment the isolation and stagnation by the end of the 14th century.\nThe desolate environment in which Loulé was present, were supported by the 1385 \"Actas de Vereação\" (\"Acts of Town Council\"), by which Camareiro-Mor João Afonso affirmed that the village was unpopulated, its castle in ruins and debris littered the field. In order to alleviate the situation, King D. John I bestowed special privileges on the village to expand the settlement, then donated land in front of the Church of São Clemente for a courtyard. The \"Actas\" also gave notice that the King of Castile was prepared to enter Portugal. In order to prevent its eventual attack, there was a move to repair the tower over the \"Porta de Faro\" and raise the walls along the southern flank. This area, until the 16th century, for reasons of defense and accessibility was the principal urban space, penetrated by a various roadways: the \"Largo da Matriz\" which crossed the principal arterials (the \"Rua Martim Farto\", \"Rua da Cadeia\" and \"Rua da Matriz\") which connected the principal spaces of the village, alcaldery, town council, jailhouse and gates.\n\nDuring Portugal's maritime expansion, the Algarve entered a new economic phase. Loulé, in this context, occupied an important place in the export of wine, olive oil, dried fruit, handicrafts, salt and fish which allowed it to prosper and recover from many years of stagnation and decay: allowing the town to expand public spaces and construct new infrastructures. In 1422, the walls were rebuilt under the orders of D. Henrique de Meneses, first Count of Loulé. In 1471, the old shelter was transformed, by order of King D. Afonso V, into the first hospital in the Algarve, in order to help injured soldiers that regressed from the battles in Tangiers. To the north, and outside the walls, new residential spaces were organized, along the roadways that would become \"Rua do Poço\", \"Travessa do Outeiro\", \"Rua da Laranjeira\" and the \"Rua do Alto de São Domingos\" (where the Order of Santiago indicated existed the Hermitage of São Domingos in 1565). In the west, they constructed the Hermitage of São Sebastião half a league from the centre, and the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Piedade, which complimented the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Pobres (which was erected in 1400).\n\nBy the end of the 16th century, Portugal had lost its independence following the events of Alcácer Quibir. The region and village of Loulé was, once again, threatened by coastal attacks from pirates along the coast, yet the castle defenses had already become threatened and had fallen into ruin. After 1630, the economic vitality of the Algarve began to fall, its populations stagnating and political instability contributing to Barbary Coast piracy. The regions expansion suffered, even as new buildings were being constructed: in 1600, the Church of Portas do Ceu was constructed; in the three of the gates of the castle they constructed hermitages to Nossa Senhora da Conceição, Nossa Senhora do Pilar and Nossa Senhora do Carmo; in the courtyard, they constructed the Church of Espírito Santo (then recovered and expanded in 1693); expanded the nunnery of Convent of Nossa Senhora da Conceição; and in the east, D. Francisco Barreto, second bishop of the Algarve, laid the cornerstone of the Convent of Santo António (1675). After the Restoration, the castle took on a defensive role and lands surrounding the structure were occupied by new construction.\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century, during the reign of John V, Portugal lived a period of economica prosperity sustained by gold from Brazil. Many of the churches and chapels were enriched by the spoils of conquest; gold, azulejo, rich woods, and artistic treasures were used to beautify the religious structures of the kingdom, by artesans in the region and factories in the north. A group of public works expanded to the edge of the town, primarily west of the Convent of Graça, south of the old Corredoura, east of the old \"Largo dos Inocentes\" square and \"Rua da Carreira\", and north to the \"Rua da Praça\" and \"Rua da Laranjeira\". But, much of the village was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake: the towers of the castle cracked, walls crumbled, church and Convent of Graça collapsed, and the patrochial church experienced grave damage; those civilian buildings that were not destroyed became uninhabited and the municipal hall was so damaged that sessions were realized in a small house along \"Rua Ancha\", later in a building on the edge of the municipal square. After the reconstruction of the village new residential areas began to pop-up with several occupied by the local merchant-class.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 19th century, the political instability generated by the Napoleonic Wars, the flight of the monarchy and the Liberal Wars provoked an economic crisis. In order to alleviate the financial burden and consolidate the public debit, \"Ministro da Fazenda\" (\"Minister of Finances\"), Mouzinho da Silveira decreed the sale of national possessions and expropriation of convents. As a consequence, the Convent of Espírito Santo, closed since 1836, was occupied and transformed into the municipal hall and judicial tribunal, while the church converted into a theatre. Meanwhile, alongside the walls of the old castle, the lots were occupied for residential and commercial purposes. However, the greatest transformation occurred with the opening of Avenida Marçal Pacheco that connected the east and west, along the \"Rua da Praça\" (today \"Avenida Praça da República\"), resulting in the demolition the hermitage of Carmo and part of the wall alongside. The \"Rua da Praça\" was along the principal circulation of the most important social, economic and cultural space in the tow. In 1885, it began to symbolize the most important political space in the town, after the municipal council was transferred to its current place. At the end of the 19th century, the town had expanded to the west, initiating a new phase of urbanization in Quinta do Olival de São Francisco, which was integrated into the new civil parish of São Sebastião, created in 1890 after São Clemente was divided. This new zone had a modern plan with roads design from existing roadways, forming rectangular blocks and triangular public spaces. The urban and demographic growth in this period was associated with industrialization that attracted a nascent population to small artisanal factories. This process was aided by the evolution of transport, the construction of rail lines in the Algarve and the development of communication lines that contributed to the demographic shift of the municipality.\n\nBefore the establishment of the First Republic, many of the contemporary architectural structures were constructed, including the municipal market, a project of architect Mota Gomes. This project substantially altered the urban character of the town, provoking the considerable destruction of the castle. But, it was the opening of the \"Avenida José da Costa Mealha\" that had a considerable logistic and architectural impact on the town. Until the establishment of the Estado Novo, the greatest improvements came from replacing the public lighting and installation of a water supply and drainage system. Following the military coup on 28 May 1926, until the Carnation Revolution, the growth of Loulé proceed moderately with the modernization of \"Avenida José da Costa Mealha\" (today \"Avenida 25 de Abril\"), that helped to spur many of the more expressive buildings in the town (such as the Cine-Teatro Louletano and the Duarte Pacheco monument). These developments assisted in accelerating the construction in Loulé. To the northeast and south of \"Avenida José da Costa Mealha\" large residential blocks occupied old agricultural properties and traditional architecture.\n\nLoulé is well known for the sandy beaches, such as Quarteira. Inland, Loulé shows a rich geology, paleontology, and wildlife.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 9 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nA highlight of the summer months in Loulé is Noite Branca, the Festival of White Night held to celebrate the end of summer. Locals and tourists, all wearing white, converge on the town, where a dazzling display of music, dance and pageantry awaits. Young people wander the streets, dressed in white as princes and princesses, demons and winged fantasy figures, while live bands play in the background.\nLoulé is also the largest municipality in the Algarve and includes well-known towns near the sea (like Vilamoura or Quinta do Lago) but also the hidden villages in the Algarve mountains where there are unmistakable landscapes.\n\nIn Pavilhão Desportivo Municipal de Loulé, a World Cup is held every year in the sport of trampolining.\n\n\n"}

The latter is a tributary of the Kouga.\n\nAlthough the rainfall in the catchment area is low, it supports a commercial irrigated agriculture in the lower catchment in which oranges, tobacco, citrus fruit and vegetables are grown. There is an estuary where the Gamtoos river enters the Indian Ocean. It is located between Jeffreys Bay and Port Elizabeth and the Gamtoos River Mouth Nature Reserve is in the area. The towns of Hankey, the oldest town situated in the Gamtoos river valley, and Patensie are situated in the lower catchment. Further inland are the towns of Steytlerville, Joubertina, Uniondale, Willowmore and Murraysburg.\n\nTributaries include the Loerie River, Klein River, Hol River, besides the Groot and the Kouga that form the Gamtoos.\n\nSaartjie Baartman - the \"Hottentot Venus\" - was born around 1789 in the vicinity of the Gamtoos river.\n\nIn 1877 during a severe drought in the region, the Gamtoos River dried up completely.

Tchaikovsky arranged the second movement for cello and string orchestra in 1888. \n\nThe quartet has four movements:\n\nThe melancholic second movement, which has become famous in its own right, was based on a folk song, likely the Song of the Volga Boatmen, the composer heard at his sister's house at Kamenka whistled by a house painter. When the quartet was performed at a tribute concert for Leo Tolstoy, the author was said to have been brought to tears by this movement: “…Tolstoy, sitting next to me and listening to the Andante of my First Quartet, burst into tears\". When the Zoellner Quartet, at her request, performed the second movement for Helen Keller, who rested her fingertips on a resonant tabletop to sense the vibrations, she, too, reacted strongly.

{"id": "1990430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990430", "title": "Frazione", "text": "Frazione\n\nFrazione (; ) is the Italian name given in administrative law to a type of territorial subdivision of a \"comune\", the italian municipality; for other administrative divisions, see \"municipio\", \"circoscrizione\", \"quartiere\". It is cognate to the English word \"fraction\", but in practice is roughly equivalent to \"civil parishes\" or \"wards\" in other countries.\n\nTypically the term \"frazioni\" applies to the villages surrounding the principal town (the \"capoluogo\") of a \"comune\". Subdivision of a \"comune\" is optional; some \"comuni\" have no \"frazioni\", but others have several dozen. The \"comune\" usually has the same name of the \"capoluogo\", but not always.\n\nIn practice, most \"frazioni\" are small villages or hamlets, occasionally a clump of houses. Not every hamlet is classified as a \"frazione\"; those that are not are often referred to as \"località\", for example, in the telephone book. On some occasions, \"frazioni\" can be more populated than the \"capoluogo\" of the \"comune\". Due to unusual circumstances or to the depopulation of the \"capoluogo\", the town hall and its administrative functions can move to one of the \"frazioni\": the \"comune\" still retains the name of the \"capoluogo\".\n\nHistorically, many \"frazioni\" came into being during the Fascist era, when a major effort was made to consolidate and rationalize the territorial subdivisions of the country. Sometimes, a \"frazione\" represents a former \"comune\" that was believed to be no longer viable. \n\nUntil 2000, the central government established the frazioni and defined their borders, except in the case of the five autonomous regions (see Regions of Italy), where this was controlled at the regional level. By the Legislative Decree 267/2000 to implement amendments to Title V of the Italian Constitution, the individual \"comuni\" now define the \"frazioni\" within their borders.\n\n\nUnder the former legislation, a \"frazione\" had the option of having a \"prosindaco\" (submayor), who was appointed by the mayor (\"il sindaco\") of the \"comune\", often on the recommendation of deliberative bodies such as the communal council (\"consiglio\") or the \"giunta\", or as a result of a petition by enough residents of the \"frazione\" involved; although there was no official provision for groups of \"frazioni\" joining forces with the appointment of a single \"prosindaco\", the case was frequent enough. Under current law, however, Article 54 of the d.lgs. 267/2000 provides that a mayor may delegate mayoral functions at the \"frazione\" level to a councillor of the \"comune\".\n\nIn many \"comuni\", in addition to their advisory function, the \"frazioni\" are endowed with their own clerks and recorders of deeds, but do not maintain their own civil records.\n\n"}

{"id": "1990460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990460", "title": "Fort Wayne Fever", "text": "Fort Wayne Fever\n\nFort Wayne Fever was an American soccer team based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States. Founded in 2003, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2009, after which the franchise folded and the team left the league. The Fever, in 2013, merged in to Citadel Futbol Club into Fort Wayne United\n\nThe team played its home games at Hefner Stadium. The team's colors were white and black. The team had a sister organization, Fort Wayne Fever (W-League), which played in the W-League.\n\nFort Wayne Fever entered the USL Premier Development League as an expansion franchise in 2003, having already existed for many years as a successful youth soccer organization in the Fort Wayne area. Playing out of Hefner Stadium, Fever had a rocky start to life in competition: they lost their first ever competitive game 2–0 to state rivals Indiana Invaders, but did pick up a couple of wins in their first encounters, 2–1 over Columbus Shooting Stars and 4–2 on the road at Kalamazoo Kingdom. Fever were competitive throughout most of the rest of the season, especially away from home, where they enjoyed several healthy victories, including a 3–1 win over Columbus in early June, a 3–0 over Toledo Slayers in early July, and a 2–1 over Sioux Falls Spitfire. Unfortunately, two losses and a tie in their final three games – including a 4–0 thrashing at the hands of Michigan Bucks on the last day of the season – put pay to any playoff hopes Fever may have had; they finished their debut year a close third in the Great Lakes Division, just six points behind Indiana.\n\n2004 was a great season for Fort Wayne, who built on their excellent debut year and were genuine challengers for their divisional title. They started the season with bang, flattening Kalamazoo Kingdom 5–2 on the opening day of the season, and registering several other high-scoring wins, 3–2 over Toledo Slayers and 4–3 over Cleveland Internationals, the latter of which saw striker Omar Jarun winning it for Fever with a 109th minute golden goal. Fort Wayne were unstoppable in June, winning six games out of six, and outscoring their opponents 24 to 6. They demolished Indiana Blast 7–3 off a hat trick from Daniel Broxup, and overwhelmed West Michigan Edge 6–1 with Broxup's second trio of the year. As the season entered its final month Fever looked poised to take their first divisional title, but inexplicably folded in the run-in, losing two of their final four regular season games, including a 1–5 humiliation at home to Michigan Bucks. Despite beating Indiana Invaders 4–3 on the final day of the season, they eventually finished the year in second place in the Great Lakes Division, just one point behind champs Michigan Bucks, but into the playoffs for the first time. Sadly for Fever, their playoff campaign was a short one, as they lost 3–1 to Heartland Division champions Chicago Fire Premier first time out; nevertheless, Fever's achievements for the year were admirable. Daniel Broxup was a monster in front of goal, netting an astonishing 19 times, making him the 5th highest scorer in the PDL in 2004, while Josh Tudela and Philip Wilson both provided 5 assists each.\n\nFever began 2005 continuing the form with which they had ended 2004; a 5–2 opening day victory over Toledo Slayers (courtesy of four goals from Daniel Broxup) was immediately followed by a 3–1 win on the road over Kalamazoo Kingdom, and Fort Wayne looked poised to challenge for honors again. However, and for reasons unclear, things never quite came together for the team. Throughout the year, Fever's form was either feast or famine: every game was either a one-sided blowout victory, or a demoralizing heavy defeat. Kyle Dulworth scored an 88th-minute winner in their 4–3 victory over Kalamazoo in early June, they outscored Thunder Bay Chill 9–2 in their three games in late June and early July and absolutely flattened West Michigan Edge 6–1 in the penultimate game of the season. However, they were annihilated 7–0 at home Michigan Bucks in mid-June, and also suffered a desperate four-game losing streak in July, losing 5–1 to Thunder Bay, 4–0 to West Michigan, and 3–1 to Chicago Fire Premier in quick succession. The 5–0 defeat to Indiana Invaders on the final day of the season ended the campaign on a low note; they finished the year fourth in the Great Lakes Division, a full 22 points behind division champs Chicago Fire Premier, and out of the playoffs. Daniel Broxup was again Fort Wayne's top scorer, albeit with just 7 goals on the season, while Kyle Dulworth contributed 4 assists.\n\nFort Wayne's form took a calamitous turn in 2006; they won just one game all season long – 2–0 over Cleveland Internationals in early June off a brace from Lance Muckey – and lost or tied their other 15 encounters, and only finished out of the Great Lakes Division basement by virtue of the fact that they tied more games than the equally abysmal Cleveland Internationals. To Fever's credit, most of their losses were tight affairs, usually one goal decisions, often as a result of conceding heartbreaking late winners. In the most extreme examples, West Michigan Edge scored a 90th-minute goal to win 2–1 on the opening day of the season, and then came from a goal down to win 3–2 in their second encounter in June, and they even let a 3-goal lead slip in their 3–3 tie with the Michigan Bucks. It was all quite frustrating for the Fever fans, who were not used to seeing their team suffer this badly. Philip Wilson was Fort Wayne's top scorer, with 8 goals; John Michael Hayden and John Mellencamp registered 2 assists apiece.\n\nThings got slightly better for Fever in 2007, as they improved to a 4–11–1 record, but still finished rock bottom of the Great Lakes Division, mainly as a result of the improved form of rivals Cleveland Internationals. Three of their four victories came in the early part of the season, and included a battling 3–2 victory over West Michigan Edge and two wins over Cleveland, the second of which saw Fever fight back from a goal down to register another 3–2 result. Unfortunately, elsewhere, Fort Wayne suffered: as was the case before, Fever at least kept the majority of the scorelines respectable, only losing spectacularly once, 5–0 away at Chicago Fire Premier. Everything else was tight – they let a 2-goal lead slip to lose 3–2 to West Michigan in mid-June, and dropped a tight 1–0 decision at home to new boys St. Louis Lions, although they did come back from 3–1 down to tie 3–3 with Cleveland on July 1 thanks to late goals from Philip Wilson and Harrison Heller, their only tie of the season. Their only other victory of the season came in mid-July against Toronto Lynx, a bad-tempered game which saw both sides reduced to 10 men, but where Fort Wayne held on take a 3–2 win. Their top scorer, yet again, was the reliable Philip Wilson, with 5 goals, while Gary Boughton contributed 3 assists.\n\nFort Wayne moved to the Midwest Division following the 2008 PDL divisional re-alignment, but remained disappointingly uncompetitive, slumping to a 2–9–5 record, and finishing fourth of five in the division, 18 points behind champs Chicago Fire Premier. Ironically, one of Fever's two wins was against Chicago, a 1–0 decision away off a goal from Gary Boughton. Sadly, this was about as good as it got for Fever; they leaked goals everywhere else they went, losing 5–0 to Michigan Bucks, 4–1 to Toronto Lynx, and losing 2–1 in three consecutive games at home to Chicago, new boys Kalamazoo Outrage, and the resurgent Cleveland Internationals, who scored an 87th-minute winner to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Fever's only other win of the season was actually a pretty comprehensive 4–1 revenge victory over Toronto Lynx in which Gary Boughton scored a hat trick, but they reverted to form quickly thereafter. The 5–0 loss to West Virginia Chaos in the penultimate game was perhaps the season's nadir; Boughton was Fort Wayne's top scorer with 6 goals.\n\nIn spring 2013, Fever merged into Cidadel Futbol Club to create the new Fort Wayne United Soccer Club.\n\n\"vs. Chicago Fire Premier, July 18, 2009\"\n\n\n\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html.\n\n\n\n"}

Schatz graduated from Rutgers University in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in soil microbiology, and received his doctorate from Rutgers in 1945.\n\nIn 1943, as a 23-year-old postgraduate research assistant working in the university's soil microbiology laboratory under the direction of Selman Waksman, Schatz volunteered to search for soil-borne microorganisms that would kill or inhibit the growth of penicillin-resistant bacteria including tubercle bacillus, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). In three and a half months, he had isolated two distinct microorganisms excreting a substance (which he named \"streptomycin\") that stopped the growth of tubercle bacillus and several other penicillin-resistant bacteria in a Petri dish.\n\nSchatz was born in Norwich, Connecticut, and raised on a poor, isolated Passaic, New Jersey farm by his Russian Jewish émigré father and English mother. His initial interest in soil microbiology stemmed from his intention to become a farmer. Seeing workers being assaulted by the authorities during the Depression prompted him to lifelong socialism and humanitarianism. Vivian Rosenfeld, a student at New Jersey College for Women, and he were married in March 1945 and they had two daughters, Linda and Diane. The couple were enthusiastic naturalists and environmentalists and they enjoyed the wilds of Vermont.\n\nSchatz opposed the fluoridation of drinking water based on the biochemical impact of fluoride on tissue, argued for a \"proteolysis-chelation theory\" of tooth decay that emphasized biochemical reactions of organic matter over the demineralization theory and proposed a novel theory for the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs related to the evolution of plants and microbiology.\n\nA fellow postgraduate student, Doris Ralston, described Schatz as \"A poverty-stricken, brilliant student who worked with a burning intensity.\" He graduated from Rutgers University in 1942 and commenced working as a postgraduate assistant under the supervision of Selman Waksman, who led the soil microbiology department at Rutgers college of agriculture. Waksman had been directing a research program searching for new antibiotic compounds generated by microorganisms in ordinary soil since 1937, and his teams were to discover more than 10 such chemicals between 1940 and 1952. After five months, Schatz was conscripted, and worked as a bacteriologist at a military hospital in Florida until he was discharged due to back problems.\n\nOn his return to Waksman's lab in 1943, Schatz offered to take on the search for an antibiotic effective against the tubercle bacillus (the bacterium that causes TB) and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for other penicillin-resistant diseases. Within three and a half months, he had identified two related strains of bacteria in the phylum Actinomycetes which stopped the growth of tubercle bacillus and several Gram-negative bacteria. One strain came from a throat swab from a healthy chicken, the other from heavily manured field soil. He named the antibiotic derived from these bacteria \"streptomycin.\"\n\nToxicity tests, animal trials, and early clinical trials, for which Schatz produced the streptomycin, were conducted by Mayo Clinic, and by 1944, large clinical trials conducted by Merck in the UK and USA had proven streptomycin's effectiveness against TB, bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid fever, and other penicillin-resistant diseases. \nAfter leaving Rutgers in 1946, Schatz worked at Brooklyn College, and the National Agricultural College in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He was a professor at the University of Chile from 1962 to 65, professor of education at Washington University from 1965 to 69, and professor of science education at Temple University from 1969 to '80.\n\nSchatz was lead author, with Waksman, on the paper that first reported the discovery of streptomycin, and the second author, with Waksman, on the streptomycin patent application. At Waksman's request, in 1946, Schatz signed over his right to royalties from the US streptomycin patent to the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation, and later signed over his foreign rights. He said he agreed to this so as to make streptomycin available as readily and inexpensively as possible, and he understood that the foundation, also, was to receive no profit from the discovery.\n\nSchatz began to feel that Waksman was playing down his (Schatz's) role in the discovery, and taking all the credit and recognition for their achievement. In 1949, it came out that Waksman, contrary to his public pronouncements, had a private agreement with the foundation giving him 20% of the royalties – which by then had amounted to $350,000 ($ today) – so, in March 1950, Schatz sued Waksman and the foundation for a share of the royalties and recognition of his role in the discovery of streptomycin.\n\nAn out-of-court settlement awarded Schatz $120,000 for the foreign patent rights, and 3% of the royalties, representing about $15,000 per annum for several years. Waksman conceded in court that Schatz, \"is entitled to credit legally and scientifically as co-discoverer of streptomycin.\" Schatz was never again able to get work in a top-level microbiology lab.\n\nIn October 1952, it was announced that Waksman would be awarded that year's Nobel prize for physiology or medicine for the discovery of streptomycin. After receiving letters from the vice president of the agricultural college where Schatz was working at the time, and others, the Nobel committee's wording of the actual award on 12 December 1952 was for, \"ingenious, systematic and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin\" rather than, \"for the discovery of streptomycin\" as the original announcement had said.\n\nWhen Milton Wainwright from Sheffield University arrived at Rutgers and interviewed faculty members for his 1990 book on antibiotics, \"Miracle Cure\", asking questions about Schatz, it piqued the curiosity of some professors, who made their own inquiries and spoke with Schatz. Convinced that he had been the victim of an injustice, a group of professors, including Karl Maramorosch and Douglas Eveleigh, began to lobby for Schatz's rehabilitation, culminating in the 1994 awarding of the Rutgers University Medal, the university's highest honor, to Schatz.\n\nSchatz received honorary degrees from Brazil, Peru, Chile, and the Dominican Republic. On the 50th anniversary of the discovery of streptomycin, in 1994, he was awarded the Rutgers University Medal. \"The New York Times\" placed Schatz and Waksman's 1948 streptomycin patent in the top 10 discoveries of the 20th century. The university has made Schatz's basement lab into a museum documenting his and other antibiotic discoveries made at the college.\n\nAs a result of the streptomycin controversy, regulations were passed in the US aimed at ensuring graduate students get due recognition and reward for their contributions. Albert Schatz's archives were donated to the Temple University Library.\n\n"}

{"id": "1990507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990507", "title": "Bronn (character)", "text": "Bronn (character)\n\nBronn is a fictional character in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIntroduced in 1996's \"A Game of Thrones\", Bronn is a low-born sellsword (mercenary) of great skill and cunning who comes into the service of Tyrion Lannister as his personal bodyguard, assassin, and enforcer. He subsequently appeared in Martin's \"A Clash of Kings\" (1998) and \"A Storm of Swords\" (2000). Through his relationship with Tyrion, Bronn is able to quickly attain great wealth, position, and influence in the royal court of King's Landing.\n\nBronn is portrayed by Jerome Flynn in the HBO television adaptation. His role was significantly expanded from that in the novels.\n\nBronn is sarcastic, with a black sense of humor and a pragmatic, amoral philosophy for life. However, he is neither completely heartless nor sadistic. He openly expresses sympathy to Tyrion Lannister after making the pragmatic decision not to champion him during Lannister's second trial by combat. After Tyrion asks him if he would murder an innocent baby in front of her mother without question, Bronn denies it and claims that he would ask for a price, implying that he may do the deed, but not for free and not just because he was ordered to. Despite Bronn's avaricious nature, which is sneered at by more honorable knights, he is a skilled and dangerous fighter.\n\nBronn is mostly a background character in the novels. Since he is not a point of view character in the novels, his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Catelyn Stark and Tyrion Lannister.\n\nBronn is a skilled sellsword of low birth. Debuting in \"A Game of Thrones\", he helps Catelyn Stark escort her prisoner, Tyrion Lannister, to the Eyrie, presumably in the hope of a reward. During the journey, he befriends Tyrion and also demonstrates his skill with a sword when they are attacked by members of the Mountain Clans. Bronn later accepts Tyrion's offer to champion for him in a trial by combat, recognizing there is more gain in helping Tyrion. He wins the duel against Lysa Arryn's champion, Ser Vardis Egen. Bronn wears minimal armor and uses his superior skill and speed to easily beat him. He becomes Tyrion's personal bodyguard and accompanies him to the camp of Tywin Lannister's army, and later King's Landing, serving as his captain of the guard and right-hand man. When Stannis Baratheon attacks the capital, Bronn is knighted for his defense of the city, taking up the name \"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater\" and taking a green burning chain as his personal sigil in commemoration of his role in the battle. In \"A Storm of Swords\", Tyrion is accused of murdering King Joffrey Baratheon and asks Bronn to champion him in a second trial by combat, this time against the monstrous Gregor Clegane. Bronn recognizes that although he can conceivably win, the benefits aren't worth the risks, and declines. Instead he takes up Cersei's offer to marry Lollys of the wealthy House Stokeworth, an unmarried woman who is pregnant from being raped during a riot. When his wife gives birth, Bronn names his stepson Tyrion in dubious honor of his former employer. Cersei tells Lollys' brother-in-law Balman Byrch to kill Bronn, fearing he is in league with Tyrion. However, Bronn wins a duel against Balman and kills him instead. After all members of House Stokeworth ahead of his wife die under mysterious circumstances, Bronn takes control of the house and styles himself as Lord Protector of Stokeworth.\n\nBronn is played by the English actor and singer Jerome Flynn in the television adaption of the series of books.\n\nBronn initially serves under Catelyn Stark. He aids her in arresting Tyrion Lannister and taking him to the Vale to stand trial for the murder of Jon Arryn and attempted murder of Bran Stark. During the trial, he volunteers to fight for Tyrion when he demands a trial by combat. Bronn defeats Lysa Arryn's champion and becomes Tyrion's companion and protector, accompanying him back to King's Landing.\n\nBronn's service to Tyrion earns him a position as Commander of the City Watch after his predecessor is revealed to be accepting bribes. When Stannis Baratheon attacks the city by sailing up the Blackwater Bay, he shoots a fire arrow to a ship containing wild fire which destroys half of Stannis' fleet, and kills several of the attackers in defence of the city.\n\nBronn is stripped of his position after Tywin Lannister takes his seat as Hand of The King, but is knighted for his service during the defense of King's Landing, taking the name Ser Bronn of Blackwater. He subsequently demands more gold for protecting Lord Tyrion and remains his confidante, though discord is increasing between the two. When Tyrion is forced to marry Sansa Stark, Bronn claims he desires her sexually, which Tyrion takes as a grave insult.\n\nTyrion pays Bronn to train Jaime Lannister in fencing with his left hand, as well as get Shae out of King's Landing, which he assures was completed. Bronn later implores Jaime to visit and help Tyrion after he is accused of murdering Joffrey, telling Jaime that Tyrion originally named him as his defender while on trial in the Vale before Bronn volunteered. Bronn is later offered betrothal to the wealthy House Stokeworth by Cersei, if he does not champion Tyrion in trial by battle again. Bronn visits Tyrion in his cell to inform him, and tells him that he most likely would not have been prepared to fight Ser Gregor Clegane, Cersei's champion, anyway. He bids Tyrion farewell and they part ways as friends.\n\nJaime is sent to retrieve Myrcella Baratheon from Dorne and travels to Stokeworth to enlist Bronn, who is with his betrothed, Lollys Stokeworth. Bronn reluctantly agrees to help Jaime after he is promised a prettier bride and a larger castle. Arriving at Dorne's Water Gardens, Jaime and Bronn rescue Myrcella before being confronted by Oberyn Martell's bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes, who had intended to kill Myrcella. A fight ensues which is eventually broken up by Doran Martell's bodyguard Areo Hotah and the other palace guards, and Bronn is placed in a cell next to the Sand Snakes. In the cells, Tyene Sand taunts Bronn by exposing her breasts before revealing that she had given him a poison that activates when his heart rate increases, only giving him the antidote when he calls her the \"most beautiful woman in the world\". Bronn is eventually allowed to return to King's Landing with Jaime and Myrcella, though Trystane Martell insists that Bronn first be struck by Areo as punishment for knocking him out during Myrcella's rescue.\n\nAfter Brynden \"Blackfish\" Tully captures Riverrun from House Frey, Jaime has Bronn to accompany him to Riverrun to assist in directing the siege. During this time, Bronn is briefly reunited with Podrick Payne, Tyrion's former squire who now serves under Brienne. When the siege is lifted, Bronn joins the Lannister army at a feast at House Frey's home The Twins. He is noticeably disgruntled when several female servants appear smitten with Jaime, unaware one is secretly a disguised Arya Stark. He returns to King's Landing with Jaime, and, like Jaime, is shocked to discover that Cersei's machinations have destroyed the Sept of Baelor in their absence.\n\nAlong with Randyll and Dickon Tarly, Bronn assists Jaime Lannister in the capture of Highgarden, but is disgruntled when Jaime refuses to let him keep the ransacked castle. As the Lannister caravan returns to King's Landing, they are attacked by Daenerys Targaryen with her dragon Drogon and her horde of Dothraki. Bronn manages to wound Drogon with a scorpion, which forces Daenerys to dismount, and saves Jaime from being burned alive by Drogon when Jaime charges at Daenerys. Both Bronn and Jaime escape the battle and return to King's Landing, where Bronn arranges a meeting in the cellars of the Red Keep between Jaime and Tyrion (at the request of the latter) to negotiate a truce between Daenerys and Cersei.\n\nBronn remains in King's Landing after Jaime rides North alone to stand with the Starks against the White Walkers. He is approached by Qyburn, who gifts him Joffrey's crossbow and several chests of gold from Cersei, with the order to assassinate Jaime and Tyrion. Bronn travels to Winterfell to confront Jaime and Tyrion, but admits that he believes Daenerys had the advantage with her dragons and agrees to spare the two in exchange for being named Lord of Highgarden.\n\nAfter Bran Stark is crowned king, Bronn is raised to Lord of Highgarden and Lord Paramount of the Reach, and named as Bran's Master of Coin.\n"}

It is based in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It is a member of FIFA and is responsible for governing amateur and professional football and including the men's and women's national teams. The TTFA is also responsible for sanctioning referees and football tournaments for leagues in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe association was known as the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation (TTFF) between 1992 and 1 July 2013.\n\nThe first World Cup qualification campaign for the national team began in 1965 in preparation for the 1966 World Cup. The team failed to qualify after finishing last in their group in the First Round of qualification. However, in 1973, Trinidad and Tobago came within two points of qualifying for the 1974 World Cup in controversial fashion. Trinidad and Tobago lost a crucial game on 4 December 1973 against hosts Haiti 2–1 having five of their goals disallowed.\n\nIt was not until qualification for the 1990 World Cup that the national team would be in contention again. Needing only a draw to qualify in their final home game against the United States, Trinidad and Tobago's hopes were dashed by Paul Caligiuri who scored the game's only goal in the 38th minute to give the United States the last qualification spot for the World Cup.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, its first-ever qualification for the tournament. They became the smallest country to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2006, succeeding Haiti for the title. In Germany, Trinidad and Tobago were grouped with England, Sweden and Paraguay in Group B. The team earned some international respect after a draw with Sweden in their opening game and managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes. Trinidad and Tobago finished with their first-ever point from World Cup play after finishing 0–1–2 for the tournament.\n\nFollowing the 2006 World Cup, the national team was thrown into turmoil by a dispute between the players from the World Cup squad and the TTFF. Prior to the competition, the players had agreed to a bonus scheme with the TTFF, where the players would share 50% of the federation's income from the World Cup.\n\nFollowing the competition, the TTFF declared the income and expenses of TT$18.25 million and TT$17.97 million, respectively. This left TT$282,952 in net revenue and offered each player TT$5600, whereby the players rejected the offer. Subsequently, the TTFF revised their figure to TT$950,000. The amount the Federation received during their qualification campaign prior to the 2006 World Cup. The players also rejected the revised offer and requested to see the TTFF's unaudited accounts. The Federation refused the player's request.\n\nThe sixteen players were Marvin Andrews, Chris Birchall, Atiba Charles, Ian Cox, Cornell Glen, Cyd Gray, Shaka Hislop, Kelvin Jack, Avery John, Stern John, Kenwyne Jones, Collin Samuel, Brent Sancho, Aurtis Whitley, Evans Wise, and Anthony Wolfe. The players claim to have been blacklisted as none had been selected to represent the national team since a friendly against Austria in November 2006. The TTFF claimed that the decision was left to the coach, Wim Rijsbergen.\n\nOn 30 June 2007, the players initiated a lawsuit against the TTFF. Following an August 2007 inquiry by their lawyers to the Trinidad and Tobago government under the Freedom of Information Act, it was revealed that the TTFF had understated its income by at least TT$173.5 million. This was not including a TT$32 million bonus paid by the government and television revenue from friendly matches played in Europe prior to the World Cup. As a result, the players were deprived of at least TT$6.5 million each.\n\nFollowing the inquiry, the TTFF immediately lifted its ban on the players, and agreed to go to arbitration in London rather than to court. On 18 May 2008, British arbitrator Ian Mill QC ruled that the Soca Warriors were entitled to 50% of the profits of the Federation obtained from 2006 World Cup qualifying, as well as friendlies prior to the World Cup. However, on 9 Jan 2009 the proceedings never progressed as the TTFF were no longer interested in arbitration hearings in London and shifted their dispute to the Port of Spain Higher Court. The TTFF argued that the change was due to lawyers representing the 16 players breached the confidentiality clause in comments made to a local newspaper and other international media houses. A hearing of the application to lift the order which prevents the Port of Spain High Court from hearing the case is expected on 16 June 2009.\n\nIn February 2011 the High Court ruled that an interim payment of US$1,140,384.39 be paid to the footballers. The judge also rejected the accounting documents submitted by the TTFF.\n\nIn August 2012, the Federation relocated to new offices in Woodbroke as a consequence of having its equipment seized in a court order relating to unpaid payments.\n\n\n\n\nThe TT Pro League is a first division football league in Trinidad and Tobago founded in 1999 and comprises eight teams. The Women's Football League is the top-level women's football league. It was established in 1986 and consists of 15 teams in two divisions, Premier and First.\n\nThe TTFF has also, since 1927, sponsored a nationwide tournament open to all TTFF affiliated clubs known as the FA Trophy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1990534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990534", "title": "Leica Digilux 1", "text": "Leica Digilux 1\n\nThe Leica Digilux 1 was released in 2002, roughly the same time as the Canon G2 and the Nikon 2000. It is the second of Leica's digital offerings. Where the original Digilux was developed in partnership with Fuji Camera, the Digilux 1 was developed in partnership with Panasonic with whom Leica continues to partner in sharing technologies—Leica shares their ability to design superb lenses, and Panasonic designs the camera electronics. According to Leica, this allows both companies to design cameras that creates a harmonious matching of lens to sensor to produce color and contrast to Leica standards.\n\nBilled as the digital reportage camera, the Leica Digilux 1 shares almost everything with its Panasonic brother, the DMC-LC5. At the time, the Digilux 1 boasted the lowest shutter lag in comparison to other cameras in its class, in combination with its fast lens, made the camera suitable for photo reportage / photojournalistic applications. As for differences, the Digilux 1 is housed in a retro box that harkens back to the designs of Leica rangefinders, the LC5 is housed in a more modern casing, but retains identical controls. In appearance and in size, it is very similar to the Leica CM Zoom. Another unverified difference is believed to be based in image processing—some believe that the Digilux 1 performs less post processing, resulting in colors and contrast that are more in line with the color and contrast expected from a Leica camera. The Panasonic DCM-LC5 performs post processing that increases contrast and saturation to create photos that are acceptable to the consumer market.\n\nThe camera has a Leica designed Vario-Summicron of f2.0 aperture, and f 2.8 at maximum zoom of 3 x. The lens was built by Panasonic to Leica standards. This lens is also used on the Panasonic DMC-LC5, DMC-L40, Toshiba PDR-M70, and Canon G2-5. The camera itself sold for around $1500 (2011 dollars) of which the lens is estimated to have cost 50% of the total camera cost. \n\nA unique feature of the Digilux 1 (and Panasonic DMC-LC5) versus all other Digilux cameras, is that the sensor uses a complementary filter, CMYG rather than the RGB of later models. This filter had two benefits: The range of wavelengths of light captured by the sensor was much greater - it captures about 2/3 of the visible spectrum versus RGB which captures only 1/3 of the visible spectrum, so that the colors, especially reds and blues are more saturated. This is a benefit for landscapes especially. The second benefit is that the CMYG filter allows the passage of twice the photons, so that the camera is inherently 2 x more sensitive to light at the base ISO of 100 - this means that exposure times are half that of a comparable camera with RGB filter array. The camera has a 3 x zoom lens from f2.0 at the widest 35mm equivalent focal length, and f2.8 at the 100 mm equivalent focal length. Compared with modern compact cameras that usually have an f 3.5 - f 5.6 maximum aperture, the Digilux 1 at f 2.8 at 100mm, is 3 f stops faster ( 2 f stops due to f2.8 vs f5.6 and one f stop due to its 2 x sensitivity.) To match exposure time under this focal length at max available aperture requires the second camera to be set to ISO 800 while the Digilux 1 is at ISO 100 [tested cameras side by side.]\nDigilux 1 images are not noise suppressed as much as modern cameras, so it is always necessary to use a noise suppression filter in post processing when shooting above the base ISO of 100. If this is done, then ISO 400 images can be quite acceptable. AT ISO 400 and f 2.0, the exposure times will be the same as a compact camera with an f 3.5 lens at ISO 2400, and the noise levels on the Digilux 1 will be much less after post-processing.\n\nIf you run across old reviews of the camera from 2002, there is often a criticism of the noise levels and \"smearing\" or \"watercolor\" appearance. But with modern software, these issues are no longer problems. There are thousands of images on the WEB that attest to the quality of this camera (see also DMC-LC5 pictures.)\n\nLight sensitivity: On sunny days the light is usually too intense for the camera which has a minimum aperture of f 8 and a minimum exposure time of 1/1000 second. It is necessary to add a polarizing filter of 3 f stops equivalent density (or a neutral density filter,) and this requires an adapter which extends the lens housing beyond the most extreme travel of the zoom lens. This adapter is available as part of a wide angle lens kit which while sold mainly for the Panasonic DMC-LC5, fits the Digilux 1. The WA lens adapter makes a 28 mm equivalent focal length, and with the Leica 28mm optical finder which fits the flash bracket, it makes a good quality WA camera.\n\nManual focus and Macro: The Digilux 1 and DMC-LC5 can be set for macro focus, and also manual focus (fly by wire.) \nCamera cards: It will handle up to a 1GB SD card only.\n\nTIFF file format also: One of the biggest advantages is that the camera will shoot single frame TIFF files - each about 12 MB in size, and taking about 5 seconds to write to a fast SD card. These uncompressed files have none of the compression artifacts typical of JPEG files. But for rapid sequence shots the JPEG mode must be used. As also for auto exposure bracketing.\n\nFlash: The built in flash is adjustable +- 2 EV, which is good for fill in flash.\nBatteries: are readily available.\n\nManual Exposure: Full manual exposure is possible using the jog buttons. The display mimics the exposure changes rather than brightening up as the scene moves into darker areas, so that it is possible to see what the manual adjustments are doing to the image. The only problem is that for exposure time settings longer than 1/8 sec, the display won't match the actual exposed image.\n\n\n"}

She was the mother to Hussein's oldest child, Princess Alia bint Hussein. She and the king were married from 1955 to 1957, and in 1970 she married a high-ranking official in the PLO. She was a graduate of Cambridge University and a past lecturer in English literature at Cairo University.\n\nDina was born on 15 December 1929 in Cairo, Kingdom of Egypt to Sharif Abdul-Hamid bin Muhammad Abdul-Aziz Al-Aun (1898–1955) and his wife, Fahria Brav (died 1982). A member of the House of Hashim, she was entitled to use the honorific title \"sharifa\" of Mecca as an agnatic descendant of Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Dina was also a third cousin of her future father-in-law, King Talal of Jordan. Through her mother, Dina was connected to Egypt's Circassian elite. Her father and uncles claimed a \"waqf\" that consisted of nearly 2,000 feddans.\n\nLike many children of the landed Arab aristocracy, Dina was sent to a boarding school in England. She next obtained a degree in English literature from Girton College, Cambridge University, and a post graduate diploma in social science from Bedford College, London.\n\nAfter her return home, she began to teach English literature and philosophy at the University of Cairo while residing in the affluent suburb of Maadi with her parents. As a young woman, Dina was considered beautiful, highly educated, sophisticated and emancipated. She was well-liked by her entourage and friends.\n\nDina first met her distant cousin Hussein in 1952 in London at the home of a relative from Iraq. The King was then studying at the Harrow School while she was studying at Girton College, Cambridge and was pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree and obtained it with honours. After her graduation, she returned to Egypt, where Hussein visited her in Maadi thereafter. \n\nIn 1954, two years after her son's accession to the throne, Hussein's mother, the Dowager Queen Zein, who exerted a significant influence early in his reign, announced the engagement of the King and Dina. The match was considered to be perfect as Dina was a Hashemite princess, and brought up with the best education the West had to offer. The union was also strongly favoured by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the future President of Egypt. They were married on 19 April 1955 at Raghadan Palace. The bride was 26 and the groom was 19 at the time.\n\nUpon her marriage, Dina became Queen of Jordan. According to author Isis Fahmy, who interviewed Dina in the presence of her husband on their wedding day, Hussein determinedly said that she would have no political role. Fahmy noted that Hussein had intended to exercise authority over Dina, who was herself a strong personality, and that his mother viewed her as a threat to her own status.\n\nIt soon became apparent that the king and queen had little in common. On 13 February 1956, she gave birth to the king's first child, Princess Alia, but the arrival of a child did not help the royal marriage.\n\nIn 1956, while the queen was on a holiday in Egypt, the king informed her about his intention to separate from her. Hussein likely did so at the prompting of his mother, Queen Zein, with whom Dina was on bad terms. The couple divorced on 24 June 1957, during a period of strain between Jordan and Egypt, at which time she became known as \"HRH Princess Dina Abdul-Hamid of Jordan\". The ex-queen was not allowed to see her daughter for some time after the divorce.\n\nOn 7 October 1970, Dina married Lieut-Colonel Asad Sulayman Abd al-Qadir (born 27 October 1942 in Bethlehem), alias Salah Ta'amari, a Palestinian guerrilla commando who became a high-ranking official in the Palestine Liberation Organization. He was imprisoned by the Israelis in 1982. A year later, Dina negotiated one of the largest prisoner exchanges in history—freeing her husband and 8,000 other prisoners.\n\nPrincess Dina died in Amman on 21 August 2019, aged 89.\n\n\n\n\n\n|-\n"}

By 1971, Marvin began performing bass guitar on The Isley Brothers' album, \"Givin' It Back\". Within two years, he became an official member of the group. In addition to playing bass, he also provided percussion and also wrote or co-wrote some of the group's hits including \"Fight the Power\", \"The Pride\" and \"Between the Sheets\".

{"id": "1990563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990563", "title": "Margam Castle", "text": "Margam Castle\n\nMargam Castle is a large Victorian era country house, built in Margam, Port Talbot, Wales, for Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot (1803–1890). It was constructed over a ten-year period, from 1830 to 1840, on a site which had been occupied for some 4,000 years and which from the 11th century until the dissolution of the monasteries was an abbey.\n\nAlthough called a \"castle\", the building is really a large comfortable country house, one of many \"mock\" castles built in the 19th century during the Gothic Revival.\n\nAfter making a Grand Tour of Europe as a young man, Talbot returned to south Wales and from 1830 he set about redeveloping the family estate at Margam. The new castle was designed in a Tudor Gothic style by the architect Thomas Hopper (1776–1856), while Edward Haycock Snr (1790–1870) was supervisory architect and designed parts of the interior and exterior of the house, the stables, terraces and lodges. Talbot also took a keen interest in the project, encouraging his architects to borrow elements from Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire (ancestral home of the Talbots and home to his cousin William Henry Fox Talbot) and Melbury House in Dorset (home of his mother's family, the Fox-Strangways, Earls of Ilchester).\n\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot was a frequent visitor to Margam, and the castle featured as an image in some of his early photographic experiments. Margam's links with photography also include being the location of the earliest known Welsh photograph, a daguerreotype of the castle taken on 9 March 1841 by the Reverend Calvert Richard Jones.\n\nAfter the death of Emily Charlotte Talbot, the daughter of its first owner, the castle passed to her nephew and continued to be used by the Talbot family until 1941, when it was sold. David Evans-Bevan, who bought it, found it too large to live in, but could not find any public organisation interested in taking it on, and it fell into disrepair. For many years it belonged to the local authority, but was not open to the public. In 1977, a fire caused substantial damage, and it was only after this that a restoration project began in earnest.\n\nToday Margam Castle is a Grade I listed building and is in the care of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council.\n\nMargam Castle was visited by the television programme \"Most Haunted\" in its 2006 series, by SyFy's \"Ghost Hunters International\" in 2010, and \"Paranormal Lockdown\" UK in 2018. It has become a very popular venue for paranormal investigation events groups. In 2013 the Margam Ghost Walk (which seeks to explain the stories of the reputed hauntings but which does not undertake paranormal investigation) became the most popular attraction in the Neath Port Talbot authority area, according to the review website Tripadvisor. In 2020, a British horror feature film, The Haunting of Margham Castle, was shot there.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1990566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990566", "title": "Berg River", "text": "Berg River\n\nThe Berg River (also called Great Berg River or in Afrikaans: Bergrivier) is a river located just north of Cape Town in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. It is approximately 294 km (183 mi) long with a catchment area of 7,715 km² (2979 mi²) and debouches into the Atlantic Ocean. About 65% of the Berg River area is under agriculture. The major towns in the Berg River area are Velddrif and Laaiplek near the coast, Piketberg, Hopefield, Moorreesburg and Darling further inland.\n\nThe Berg River can be subdivided into the following segments:\n\nThe first known European record of the Berg River was made by bailiff Abraham Gabbema in 1657 when Dutch Governor Jan van Riebeeck sent him to trade with the Khoekhoe for meat for the settlement at the Cape. Gabbema named the river the ‘Groot Berg Rivier’. In years to follow many of van Riebeeck’s men relied on the river waters and followed its winding course as they ventured northwards. Despite Gabbema’s visit, the Berg Catchment was not developed until Governor Simon van der Stel’s time (1679–1699), prior to which settlement was limited to the Peninsula. Governor van der Stel visited the area with the first free burghers, and prompted by the Berg River’s fertility and beauty, he established the first European settlements at Paarl and in the Drakenstein valley in 1687. Wellington, Franschhoek and Tulbagh were established shortly after this as the farmlands expanded.\n\nThe 2004 government report on the river said:\n“Historically, the Berg River was one of many habitats in the Cape inhabited by hippos but, in the late 1600s, hunters began overexploiting the hippos for their meat and hides, resulting in a decline in their numbers. By the mid-1700s, they had declined to such an extent that governor Tulbagh introduced a fine of 1000 guilders for anyone caught killing a hippo. Despite this protection, their numbers continued to dwindle as human settlement altered and destroyed their habitat. By the early 1800s, perhaps only a dozen remained, sheltering in the region of Kersefontein and the estuary. In 1829, only six hippos remained. The last known hippo was shot in 1869 by Martin Melck when it attacked and killed one of his employees.\" See Skead for more details.\n\nThe Berg River's native fishes contain some species which are endemic to the region such as the Cape galaxias \"(Galaxias zebratus)\" and Berg River redfin (\"Pseudobarbus burgi\"). They have been adversely affected by unsustainable human use of the water, but mainly by expanding stocks of exotic fishes, which were originally introduced to establish a European-type fishery. Most problematic among these is the predatory Smallmouth Bass (\"Micropterus dolomieu\"). The Cape whitefish (\"Pseudobarbus capensis\") – listed Endangered in the IUCN Red List – seems to have disappeared from the Berg River proper in recent times; this large species it survives elsewhere and may be suitable for fishery or aquaculture. The Berg River redfin (\"Pseudobarbus burgi\") has one of its last major populations in the Berg River; its decline there seems to have stopped or at least slowed, but it too is already listed as Endangered by the IUCN. Trout are also a problem in the upper Berg river.\n\n\n"}

I myself will defend it as My own glory.\" (\"Diary\" 48)\n\nJesus is shown, in most versions, as raising his right hand in blessing and pointing with his left hand on the Sacred Heart from which flow forth two rays: one red and one pale. The depiction contains the message \"Jesus I trust in you\" (Polish: \"Jezu ufam Tobie\"). The rays that stream out have symbolic meanings: red for the blood of Jesus (which is the Life of Souls) and pale for the water (which justifies souls) (\"Diary\" 299). The whole image is a symbol of charity, forgiveness and love of God, referred to as the \"Fountain of Mercy\". According to Faustina's diary, the image is based on her 1931 vision of Jesus.\n\nFaustina directed the painting of the first image in Vilnius by the artist Eugeniusz Kazimirowski. Since then, numerous versions of the image have been painted by other artists, including a popular rendition by Adolf Hyła in Kraków. They are widely venerated worldwide and are used in the celebration of Divine Mercy Sunday, observed in Roman Catholic as well as some Anglican churches.\n\nFaustina Kowalska was a Polish nun who joined the convent of Our Lady of Mercy, in Warsaw, in 1925. In her diary, which was later published as the book \"\", Faustina wrote about a number of visions of Jesus and conversations with him. Her confessor was Michael Sopocko, a priest and a professor of theology.\n\nIn 1930, Faustina was assigned to the convent in Płock, Poland. Faustina stated that in her cell on the night of Sunday, 22 February 1931, Jesus appeared to her as the \"King of Divine Mercy\" and was robed in a white garment.\n\nFaustina wrote that Jesus' right hand was raised in a sign of blessing, the other was touching the garment near his breast, and that from beneath the garment slightly down, aside his breast, emanated two large rays, one red, the other white.\n\nIn her diary (Notebook 1, items 47 and 48), she wrote that Jesus told her:\n\nAnother nun, Sister Christine, later stated that rays of light from the window were visible that night and attracted the attention of people standing on the other side of the street, implying that it was a \"physical\" appearance, rather than an interior vision.\n\nNot knowing how to paint, Faustina approached some other nuns at her convent for help but received no assistance. She attempted to sketch the image with charcoal on canvas but had little success. In her diary (Notebook 1, item 53), she wrote that Jesus told her that she would receive \"visible help\" with the task. In November 1932, Faustina left Płock and returned to Warsaw, and in May 1933, she was sent to the convent in Vilnius to work as the gardener.\n\nIn Vilnius, Faustina met Father Michał Sopoćko, the newly-appointed confessor to the nuns. Sopocko supported Faustina's efforts and arranged for the first painting of the image by the artist Eugeniusz Kazimirowski, which was the only rendition that Faustina saw. After Faustina's death, a number of other artists painted their own versions of the image, with the depiction by Adolf Hyła being among the most reproduced ones.\n\nAfter the canonisation of Faustina in April 2000, devotion to the Divine Mercy and the image has increased. The devotional following of the image and Faustina's message has been stronger among Catholics at large than among theologians. The author Benedict Groeschel considered a modest estimate of the following in 2010 to be over 100 million Catholics.\n\nFaustina's diary relates the rays of light within the image to life and salvation, stating (Notebook 1, item 299) that she was told by Jesus:\n\nFaustina also wrote that Jesus stressed the importance of the image as part of the Divine Mercy devotion, and in Notebook 1, item 327, she attributed these words to Jesus:\n\nCatholic devotions thus stress the importance of the image as a \"conduit for grace\" as part of the Divine Mercy message.\n\nFaustina's diary also relates the image to Divine Mercy Sunday. Faustina wrote (Notebook 1, item 49) that Jesus told her that he wanted the Divine Mercy image to be \"solemnly blessed\" on the first Sunday after Easter; and that Sunday was to be the Feast of Mercy.\n\nPope John Paul II instituted \"Divine Mercy Sunday\" (Dominica II Paschae seu de divina misericordia) and placed it on the General Roman Calendar. The Divine Mercy image is often carried in processions on Divine Mercy Sunday and is placed in a location in the church so that it can be venerated by those who attended Mass.\n\nThe veneration of the Divine Mercy image also takes place in conjunction with the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Novena. The Vatican biography of Faustina states that the veneration of the Divine Mercy image is part of the second component of her message, \"entreating God's mercy for the whole world\". Praying before the Divine Mercy image (with the signature \"Jesus I trust in you\") is not only encouraged in Catholic devotions but also mentioned as a partial condition for some of the indulgences associated with Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nThe first painting was made by Eugeniusz Kazimirowski, under the supervision of Faustina and her confessor, Michał Sopoćko, in Vilnius. Sopocko was a professor of theology at the University of Vilnius and introduced Faustina to Kazimirowski, who was a professor of art there and had painted other religious images. Faustina gave Kazimirowski specific instructions about the appearance and the posture of the image, which she said she had received from Jesus Christ in a vision. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image as wearing an alb, and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter's workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Jesus told her it was not that important for the picture to be beautiful since true beauty would be the blessing that he would bestow upon people by means of the painting.\n\nAfter its completion in 1934, the Kazimirowski painting first hung in the Bernardine Sisters' convent near the church of St. Michael, where Sopoćko was a rector. In her diary, Faustina wrote that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent. The first public exposition of the Kazimirowski painting was on 26–28 April 1935, at the Church of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius. In 1937, on the Sunday after Easter, which later instituted as Divine Mercy Sunday by Pope John Paul II, the painting was put on display beside the main altar in St. Michael’s Church in Vilnius. The image, including small reproductions of it on various devotional materials, was used by Sopoćko in promoting devotion to the Divine Mercy.\n\nIn 1948, the Soviet authorities, who then occupied Lithuania, closed St. Michael's Church. The painting remained in the disused church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius, Bronė Miniotaitė and Janina Rodzevič, bought the canvas from a guard and concealed it in an attic for several years. Later, they gave it to the parish priest at the Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit for safekeeping, but he chose not to display it in the church. Father Sopocko, who had relocated to Poland but was unable to take the painting with him, expressed concern about it to his friend Father Józef Grasewicz, who obtained the painting and moved it to his own parish church in Nova Ruda, Belarus. There, it was displayed and venerated by the local parishioners. In 1970, the Soviets closed that church and used it as a storage warehouse but left the painting hanging in the disused church, where parishioners continued to venerate it in secret. In 1986, Grasewicz arranged for the painting to be replaced by a copy and the original to be secretly transported back to the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius, where it underwent a restoration that significantly changed its appearance, and it was then displayed and venerated in the church. In 2003, the painting, which had deteriorated because of exposure, attempts at cleaning, and the previous restoration, was professionally restored to its original look. In 2005, it was moved to its current location, above the main altar in the Sanctuary of Divine Mercy in Vilnius.\n\nIn 2016, a documentary film, \"The Original Image of Divine Mercy\", was released and told the story of the original Divine Mercy painting and its survival over the decades. Made with the co-operation of the Archdiocese of Vilnius, the film included interviews with Jim Gaffigan, Bishop Robert Barron, Harry Connick Jr., and Archbishop Gintaras Grusas, who also served as executive producer.\n\nAnother painting of the Divine Mercy was made by Adolf Hyła as a votive offering. In painting the picture, Hyła expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during World War II.\n\nHyła was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent and a small copy of the first painting. Hyła's image is somewhat different from Kazimirowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a \"Divine Physician\" who walks the earth and heals people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer, instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of the painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica, as it was deemed \"non-liturgical\".\n\nThe Hyła rendition is also called the \"Kraków Divine Mercy Image\" because it is kept in the sanctuary at Kraków-Łagiewniki.\n\nBefore Hyła offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned Stanisław Batowski to paint a third version. It was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting, which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hyła's. Cardinal Sapieha, who happened to be in the convent then, selected the Hyła painting because it was a votive image. A number of other artists have painted the image, but Hyła's rendition remains the most reproduced one.\n\n\"The image of The Divine Mercy, painted by Adam Styka (1957), [is] displayed in the Sanctuary of The Divine Mercy at the Congregation of Marians in Stockbridge, MA USA.\" (\"Diary\" pictures of images). A popular image was created in 1982 by American artist Robert Skemp. This rendition depicts Jesus standing in front of an arched doorway, with a more pronounced halo about his head. The Skemp and Hyła images are the most ubiquitous depictions found in the Philippines, where the devotion to the Divine Mercy is a popular one.\n\nIn 1987, Svitozar Nenyuk also painted the image itself originating its rendion to the Skemp and Hyła's Previous ones.\n\nThe Divine Mercy Shrine, Misamis Oriental, in El Salvador City, Philippines was built in 2008, and has a 15.24 m (50 ft statue of the Divine Mercy towering above the shrine.\n\nIn 1959, the Vatican banned the image and its devotion for a number of factors. Some Polish bishops questioned Kowalska's claims and were uncomfortable with the image's similarity to the red-and-white Polish flag. Polish priests were reported to be interpreting the rays as a symbol of the flag. The ban on the image and devotion to it was lifted only on April 15, 1978, after pressure from pope, Karol Wojtyła, a Pole who was a great advocate for Kowalska.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1990571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990571", "title": "Millennium Run", "text": "Millennium Run\n\nThe Millennium Run, or Millennium Simulation (referring to its size) is a computer N-body simulation used to investigate how the distribution of matter in the Universe has evolved over time, in particular, how the observed population of galaxies was formed. It is used by scientists working in physical cosmology to compare observations with theoretical predictions.\n\nA basic scientific method for testing theories in cosmology is to evaluate their consequences for the observable parts of the universe. One piece of observational evidence is the distribution of matter, including galaxies and intergalactic gas, which are observed today. Light emitted from more distant matter must travel longer in order to reach Earth, meaning looking at distant objects is like looking further back in time. This means the evolution in time of the matter distribution in the universe can also be observed directly.\n\nThe Millennium Simulation was run in 2005 by the Virgo Consortium, an international group of astrophysicists from Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the United States. It starts at the epoch when the cosmic background radiation was emitted, about 379,000 years after the universe began. The cosmic background radiation has been studied by satellite experiments, and the observed inhomogeneities in the cosmic background serve as the starting point for following the evolution of the corresponding matter distribution. Using the physical laws expected to hold in the currently known cosmologies and simplified representations of the astrophysical processes observed to affect real galaxies, the initial distribution of matter is allowed to evolve, and the simulation's predictions for formation of galaxies and black holes are recorded.\n\nSince the completion of the Millennium Run simulation in 2005, a series of ever more sophisticated and higher fidelity simulations of the formation of the galaxy population have been built within its stored output and have been made publicly available over the internet. In addition to improving the treatment of the astrophysics of galaxy formation, recent versions have adjusted the parameters of the underlying cosmological model to reflect changing ideas about their precise values. To date (mid-2018) more than 950 published papers have made use of data from the Millennium Run, making it, at least by this measure, the highest impact astrophysical simulation of all time.\n\nFor the first scientific results, published on June 2, 2005, the Millennium Simulation traced 2160, or just over 10 billion, \"particles.\" These are not particles in the particle physics sense – each \"particle\" represents approximately a billion solar masses of dark matter. The region of space simulated was a cube with about 2 billion light years as its length. This volume was populated by about 20 million \"galaxies\". A super computer located in Garching, Germany executed the simulation, which used a version of the GADGET code, for more than a month. The output of the simulation needed about 25 terabytes of storage.\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey had challenged the current understanding of cosmology by finding black hole candidates in very bright quasars at large distances. This meant that they were created much earlier than initially expected. In successfully managing to produce quasars at early times, the Millennium Simulation demonstrated that these objects do not contradict our models of the evolution of the universe.\n\nIn 2009, the same group ran the 'Millennium II' simulation (MS-II) on a smaller cube (about 400 million light years on a side), with the same number of particles but with each particle representing 6.9 million solar masses. This is a rather harder numerical task since splitting the computational domain between processors becomes harder when dense clumps of matter are present. MS-II used 1.4 million CPU hours over 2048 cores (i.e. about a month) on the Power-6 computer at Garching; a simulation was also run with the same initial conditions and fewer particles to check that features in the higher-resolution run were also seen at lower resolution.\n\nIn 2010, the 'Millennium XXL' simulation (MXXL) was performed, this time using a much larger cube (over 13 billion light years on a side), and 6720 particles each representing 7 billion times the mass of the Sun. The MXXL spans a cosmological volume 216 and 27,000 times the size of the Millennium and the MS-II simulation boxes, respectively. The simulation was run on JUROPA, one of the top 15 supercomputers in the world in 2010. It used more than 12,000 cores for an equivalent of 300 years CPU time, 30 terabytes of RAM and generated more than 100 terabytes of data. Cosmologists use the MXXL simulation to study the distribution of galaxies and dark matter halos on very large scales and how the rarest and most massive structures in the universe came about.\n\nIn 2012, the Millennium Run Observatory (MRObs) project was launched. The MRObs is a theoretical virtual observatory that integrates detailed predictions for the dark matter (from the Millennium simulations) and for the galaxies (from semi-analytical models) with a virtual telescope to synthesize artificial observations. Astrophysicists use these virtual observations to study how the predictions from the Millennium simulations compare to the real universe, to plan future observational surveys, and to calibrate the techniques used by astronomers to analyze real observations. A first set of virtual observations produced by the MRObs have been released to the astronomical community for analysis through the MRObs Web portal. The virtual universe can also be accessed through a new online tool, the MRObs browser, which allows users to interact with the Millennium Run Relational Database where the properties of millions of dark matter halos and their galaxies from the Millennium project are being stored. Upgrades to the MRObs framework, and its extension to other types of simulations, are currently being planned.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a subtropical climate and an altitude of 1600–1800 m. It lies about 120 kilometers to the southwest of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the foothills of the Andes on the way to Sucre. It is a popular resort for inhabitants of Santa Cruz due to its much cooler climate. As such, there is regular bus and taxi service to Santa Cruz. The town is small with numerous colonial buildings and narrow cobbled streets. There is a good range of hotels and restaurants. There are numerous tour agencies and guided tours operators. It is strategically located near several tourist attractions such as El Fuerte de Samaipata, the Amboro National Park, El Codo de los Andes, Cuevas waterfalls, vineyards, rapids and lagoons, as well as well-preserved colonial towns such as Vallegrande, Pampagrande, Postervalle, Santiago del Valle, Pucará, and others. It is also the first stop in the several tourist trails to Sucre, Potosi, and the Che Guevara route.\n\nThe valley was originally populated by people of the Chane culture dedicated to agriculture, hunting and gathering. The Chanes are famous for their densely populated villages, their ceramics and graphic designs, and most importantly the construction of the temple at El Fuerte de Samaipata. They cultivated mainly corn and peanuts, and were rather peaceful. There are several Chane burial sites all through the valleys and pampas of Santa Cruz between the Siberia mountain ridge and the Guapay river.\n\nThe region was later conquered by Incas as they expanded to the southeast from their native Peru. The Incas reached a pact with the Chanes and built a city at El Fuerte de Samaipata.\n\nIn the 16th century, Guarani warrior tribes, called Chiriguanos by the Incas and Spanish, coming from the south invaded the valley and defeated both Incas and Chanes. The Guaranis continued raiding the valley and the region until the 19th century. \n\nIn 1618, Pedro de Escalante y Mendoza founded Samaipata, as point of contact between Santa Cruz and Vallegrande. The town moved from its original location in a place known as Castilla to its current location a few kilometers west.\n\nSamaipata is quite cosmopolitan and diverse. Local Samaipateños from old families are descendants of Spanish colonists from Vallegrande and Santa Cruz (many of whom were of Sephardic origin) and the local Guarani natives that had invaded the valley prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. Beginning in the 1880s, some Arab families settled in Samaipata, they were followed by a few Croatians and Italians, all of which mixed and assimilated to the local population.\n\nAfter the road that passes by the town was paved in the 1960s, many migrants from all over Bolivia (mainly from nearby Santa Cruz, but also Cochabamba and Sucre) settled in this little town. Since the 1970s, several Germans, Dutch, French, Argentines and a few Japanese also moved to Samaipata and made it their home.\n\nThe local economy is mainly dedicated to tourism, agriculture (including its many vineyards) and crafts. Local farmers produce organic vegetables such as tomatoes, artichokes, lettuces and green beans. The region is also famous for its production of fruits such as peaches, grapes, plums, chirimoyas, guapurus, strawberries and figs. There is also a significant production of wines, singani, honey, marmalades, cold cuts, herbal infusions, lavender, art pieces and artisan crafts.\n\nSamaipata's climate is classified as Cfb by the Köppen climate classification system and Crbl by the Trewartha climate classification system. The climate is temperate, semi-dry in the winter months, and mild with an average annual temperature of 19.9 °C. During the winter months cold fronts called \"Surazos\" come from the Argentine Pampas and enter the plains and valleys of Santa Cruz, these cold winds combined with the altitude can reach temperatures below freezing. In the summer, the days are warm and the nights cool. Frost occurs on nine days in an average year, mostly in the winter months.\n\nSamaipata has a wine culture dating back to the first Spanish settlements in the Valleys of Santa Cruz. Although it had a dwindling production during the Republican Era, in recent years it has established itself as one of the most prominent wine regions in Bolivia. It is now the second wine region in terms of planted area and attracts an increasing number of enotourists, particularly from Santa Cruz, Bolivia's largest city.\n\nThere are three established wineries in the region: Uvairenda (where the 1750 Wines are produced), Bodegas Landsua, and El Último Vargas. Located at 1.750 m.a.s.l., Samaipata has arisen as its main representative for its high-quality wines and its success in the Bolivian market.\n\nKnown for its views and pleasant weather, Samaipata proves to be a good place for vitiviniculture. Seasonal and day/night temperature variation together with protection from the cold winds from the South, provided by the hills that surrounds the numerous valleys, Samaipata and the rest of the Valleys of Santa Cruz have become an area of increased interest for its vinicultural potential.\n\nThe main varieties produced are Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Barbera, Malbec, Torrontés grapes becoming the emblematic grapes of the region. Other varieties cultivated, although in a lesser quantity, are Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling.\n\nMany of the vineyards of Samaipata are at a walking distance from the town center, and guided tours are provided by most of them, including wine tasting at the end of the tours.\n\nNearby is the pre-Inca ruin of El Fuerte de Samaipata. It is not actually a fort, but a temple. This is Bolivia's largest pre-Inca site. \nDeclared a world heritage sites by UNESCO in 1998, this archaeological complex presents pre-Inca (Chane), Inca, and colonial Spanish ruins. The temple was originally built by Arawak people most likely belonging to the Chane culture that inhabited the surrounding valleys and the pampas to the East. The temple was carved on an enormous rock. The Incas also built a city adjacent to the temple and established trade and alliances with the Chanes to protect the territories from the constant invasions of warrior Guarani tribes that raided the region from time to time.\n\nIt is believed that both Chanes and Incas were eventually defeated by the Guarani warriors, and by the time the Spaniards colonized the region, it was already dominated by Guarani tribes, and El Fuerte was already destroyed. The Spanish colonizers also built a town next to the temple, but it was later abandoned when the inhabitants moved to base of the valley.\nThere are several interesting features including a sloping ramp, pronounced by flying saucer enthusiast Erich von Däniken in his book \"Chariots of the Gods\" to be a launch platform for spaceships. Some of the site is now cordoned off due to damage caused by visitors walking on the rock carvings.\nAlso of interest nearby, Las Cuevas , a pleasant walk by streams and waterfalls. There are several pools and beachess. A small fee is charged for entrance. Camping is not allowed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1990583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990583", "title": "Wrap advertising", "text": "Wrap advertising\n\nWrap advertising or a vehicle wrap is known as the marketing practice of completely or partially covering (wrapping) a vehicle in a vinyl material, which may be for a color change, advertising or custom delivery. The result of this process is essentially a mobile billboard. Wrap advertising can be achieved by painting a vehicle's outer surface, but an increasingly ubiquitous practice in the 21st century involves the use of large vinyl sheets as \"decals\". The vinyl sheets can later be removed with relative ease, drastically reducing the costs associated with changing advertisements. While vehicles with large, flat surfaces (such as buses and light-rail carriages) are often used, automobiles can also serve as hosts for wrap advertising, despite consisting of more curved surfaces. Wrap advertising is also used in the magazine and publishing industries.\n\nUntil the age of the automobile, train companies were the largest industry to paint company names and logos for distinction on their locomotives and railcars.\n\nThe first attempts at using the plastic in commercial applications failed as a result of being too fragile. In 1926, Waldo Semon invented the vinyl still used today by introducing additives to PVC that made it flexible and easier to process. \n\nThe world’s first total bus wrap was produced in 1991 by Contra Vision in New Zealand for the Pan Pacific Hotel. The bus was converted into a mobile billboard which still allowed passengers inside to see out. The glass was covered with see-through graphics (one-way vision window graphics) using a clear PET window film which was part screen printed and part spray painted. The bodywork was directly spray painted.\n\nA large milestone in the shift from small production vinyl lettering to a full vehicle vinyl color change took place in Germany in 1993 when the vinyl manufacturer Kay Premium Marking Films (KPMF) was asked to produce a film to be used in place of paint for the purpose of converting cars into taxis. At this time, German taxi companies were required by law to paint their fleets in a government mandated color, beige. KMPF provided an alternative to painting, which allowed taxi companies to bring a large fleet of vehicles into compliance with German law while maintaining the future resale value of the vehicle. Prior to this point, decommissioned taxis were heavily discounted or had to be completely repainted. With the use of vinyl vehicle wraps there was no need to repaint them or discount them as the vinyl could be removed without damaging the paint underneath. KPMF documented after 3 years of taxi service was complete, the vinyl was removed leaving a pristine and unscratched paint surface. \n\nThe first world’s first digitally printed vehicle wrap is thought to have been created for Pepsi Co in 1993, which used vinyl to wrap a bus promoting its Crystal Pepsi product. It wasn’t long before bus wrap advertising was everywhere and the new form of vehicle graphics trickled down to smaller businesses and consumers. Wrapping whole vehicles was still challenging. Majority of the difficulties came from premature adhesion and air bubbles under the vinyl. As technology improved, companies like Avery Dennison, 3M and Oracal developed the use of air-channels that made the vinyl repositionable and allowed for bubble-free installation. Air-channel, created using microscopic glass beads incorporated into the vinyl’s adhesive, prevented the vinyl from fully sticking to the substrates surface thereby permitting air flow between adjacent sections. In addition, these beads allow for the vinyl to be repeatedly removed and reapplied until the beads are broken by firmly pressing the vinyl using a small hard squeegee. Once the beads are broken the vinyl will be firmly adhered to the substrates surface. Proprietary company blends of polymer in the vinyl allowed the material to conform to compound curves, recesses, and corrugations through the use of heat guns and torches. \n\nAdvancements in plastics have led to new types of vinyl designed specifically for wrap advertising, including vinyl sheets that feature bubble-preventing air channels. Microscopic glass beads are used to prevent an adhesive from functioning until the user is ready (the beads allow the material to be repeatedly lifted and reapplied during the wrapping process, without compromising the longevity of the wrap). The vinyl is heated with a heat gun or torch for the purpose of molding the material around objects.\n\nDecals can be made to cover side and rear windows on a vehicle, but for safety reasons, the front windows used by the driver are not covered. The decals on side windows are typically perforated, so that it is still possible for passengers to look outside. This See-through graphic technology originated in the 1980s, with the first dominant patent registered by a British company called Contra Vision.\n\nThe term \"cast\" refers to the manufacturing process of this type of vinyl. Cast films are considered the industry premium. These films start in a liquid state with the ingredients blended together and then poured onto a casting sheet. The casting process produces a thin gauge film—usually 1- to 2-mil thick. By casting film on a sheet, the film stays in a more relaxed state, resulting in a durable, flexible, conformable and dimensionally stable film that retains color well. These films are ideal for complex surfaces such as vehicles and where a smooth finished look is expected. \n\nCalendered vinyl film or sheeting is manufactured by mixing powdered PVC, liquid softener and coloring agent into a molten dough-like mixture. The mixture is then extruded through a die and pressed into an increasingly thin sheet using a series of hard pressure rollers, called calendering rolls. When the material reaches the rollers, it passes through a series of decreasing gaps, which in turn increases the temperature and uniformity of the mixture. After each pass, the film becomes thinner and wider until the material is formed into a thin sheet of vinyl. The vinyl is then cooled, wound, and later coated with adhesive.\n\nA number of municipalities have introduced strict laws in order to mandate against mobile advertisements; this has partially been due to the fact that wrap advertisements are purposefully circulated throughout high-density areas. New York City is a notable example, where any sort of motorized advertisement is outlawed. Mobile billboards have been identified as a contributing factor in the city's already-problematic traffic congestion.\n\nThese wraps are similar in that a vinyl (although a cast vinyl sheet) is used to cover parts or whole vehicles in a new color or in a protective form of a color matching vinyl that may match an OEM paint color or may be a brand new color entirely.\n\nMany consumers are able to change the color of their vehicle to something that may not be available or even possible with paint. This may require disclosure to both the vehicle insurer and local vehicle authority, such as the DVLA in the UK.\n\nPaint protection films (PPF) are clear and OEM paint color match vinyl films designed to protect paint. Clear PPF allows the original paint color to show through the protective vinyl and color matching vinyl films replicate the OEM color with a protective vinyl.\n\n\n"}

The older Isley Brothers returned to their original vocal trio formation and continued to record, employing a number of musicians, producers, and writers to fill the void left by Chris, Ernie, and Marvin.\n\nIsley/Jasper/Isley released three albums on their CBS Associated Records label, including \"Caravan of Love,\" which featured the #1 out-of-the-box title hit, written and sung by Chris and subsequently covered by English recording group, the Housemartins, who made “Caravan” an international #1 pop hit. “Caravan of Love” has also been used in the Dodge Caravan commercials, was recorded by Marvin Sapp on the WOW 2000 gospel album, and has become an anthem sung by numerous groups and individuals throughout the world who have made their unique version of the song available on YouTube.\n\nIn 1987, Isley/Jasper/Isley disbanded. The Isley-Jasper-Isley half of the group was inducted with the rest of the Isleys in 1992 to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2014. At various times, younger brothers Marvin and Ernie Isley returned to perform with older brother Ronald Isley. Marvin Isley died from complications of diabetes in 2010 and Ernie Isley continues to perform with older brother Ronald Isley as The Isley Brothers.\n\nAfter the break-up of Isley-Jasper-Isley, Jasper continued as a solo artist, multi-instrumentalist and producer, forming his own independent record label, Gold City Records. He has since released 14 solo albums, including 4 gospel albums. He released two albums on his CBS-Associated label, Gold City Records, including the #1 R&B hit \"Superbad\" in 1988, a song which emphasized the importance of education, a theme Jasper continues to emphasize in many of the songs he has written on the 14 solo albums he has released since his days with the Isleys. In January 2013, Jasper released \"Inspired: By Love, By Life, By the Spirit,\" a compilation of love songs as well as socially conscious and spiritual tracks. In May 2014, Jasper released \"The One\", reminiscent of the soulful R&B and funk music he wrote for the Isleys. In 2016, Jasper released \"Share With Me,\" which included a cover of the Billy Preston hit, \"You Are So Beautiful\" and a special track called \"America,\" a tribute to the nation and a call to come together. And, in April 2018, Jasper pre-released a double-A single \"The Love That You Give/It's a Miracle\" from his 15th solo album, \"Dance With You,\" scheduled for a July 2018 release. Jasper, who earned a law degree in 2004, has continued to write, record, and perform all the music on his solo albums and produce artists for his Gold City label, including Liz Hogue, Out Front, and Brothaz By Choice. The most recent addition to the Gold City label is Jasper's son, Michael Jasper, an up-and-coming songwriter, recording artist and screenplay writer, who earned his law degree in 2018. In 1989, Jasper wrote, produced and performed on \"Make It Last\" for Chaka Khan's CK album. In 2015, in conjunction with Sony Music, Jasper released the \"Essential Chris Jasper\" which encompasses all of the tracks that Jasper sang lead on during his IJI years and solo career at CBS/Sony Music. In 2015, Chris received the prestigious German Record Critics Lifetime Achievement Award (\"Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik\").

{"id": "1990623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990623", "title": "Women of the House", "text": "Women of the House\n\nWomen of the House is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of \"Designing Women\" that aired on CBS from January 4, 1995, to August 18, 1995, and the last four episodes airing on Lifetime on September 8, 1995. The series starred Delta Burke, reprising her role of Suzanne Sugarbaker, who had reconciled with producers of \"Designing Women\" after a bitter, highly publicized, off-screen battle.\n\nSuzanne Sugarbaker's latest husband has died, and as his widow, she assumes his political office for the remainder of his term. Washington, D.C., was ill-prepared for the outspoken, \"big, dumb, hick beauty queen's\" arrival to the United States House of Representatives, though she did form an unusual bond with then-current President Bill Clinton, who was frequently heard off-screen. Along with her, Suzanne dragged her mentally disabled brother Jim (Jonathan Banks), her young, adopted daughter Desiree (Brittany Parkyn), and her oft-spoken of (but only once seen) maid, Sapphire Jones (Barbara Montgomery).\n\nTeri Garr starred as Suzanne's press secretary Sissy Emerson, a washed up reporter who had turned to the bottle a few years earlier, but was starting to clean up her act. Patricia Heaton portrayed Natty Hollingsworth, Suzanne's snooty, conservative, anal-retentive, bun-wearing administrative assistant whose Congressman boyfriend was serving a prison sentence. Jennifer Malone (Valerie Mahaffey, Julie Hagerty), known to her co-workers as \"Malone,\" was a vivacious, naive, frail housewife who was recently left by her husband, and whose children were tyrants. The years of sexual repression had taken its toll on Malone and she had begun to become obsessed with sex. Later seen in the cast was Lisa Rieffel as Veda Walkman, a ditsy Generation Xer who took an internship at the office. In more minor roles were William Newman as Dave, an older gentleman with bad arthritis who worked in the office and Adam Carl as Adam, another intern (which was not the same-named character Carl played in several episodes of \"Designing Women\").\n\n\n\n\nMill Creek Entertainment had secured the rights to the complete series, which was slated to be released on DVD in early 2011. In April 2011, it was announced that the DVD release has been cancelled due to \"issues surrounding the source material delivery.\" No further information regarding the status of the source material has been released, and according to Mill Creek, the DVD's removal from the release schedule is \"permanent.\"\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Questar Entertainment released \"Women of the House: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.\n\n\n"}

Of these, the Treasurer and Comptroller had originated in 1425 when the Chamberlain's financial functions were transferred to them. From 1466 the Comptroller had sole responsibility for financing the royal household to which certain revenues (the property) were appropriated, with the Treasurer being responsible for the remaining revenue (the casualty) and other expenditure. The Collector-General, created in 1562, handled the Crown's revenue from the thirds of benefices, and the Treasurer of the New Augmentation was responsible for the former church lands annexed to the Crown in 1587.\n\nAll four offices were held by the same person from 1610 onwards, but their separate titles survived the effective merging of their functions in 1635. From 1667 to 1682 the Treasury was in commission, and again from 1686 to 1708, when the separate Scottish Treasury was abolished. From 1690 the Crown nominated one person to sit in Parliament as Treasurer.\n\nThe Treasurer-depute was also a senior post in the pre-Union government of Scotland. It was the equivalent of the English post of Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nOriginally a deputy to the Treasurer, the Treasurer-depute emerged as a separate Crown appointment by 1614. Its holder attended the Privy Council in the absence of the Treasurer, but gained independent membership of the Council in 1587 and sat in the Parliament of Scotland as a Great Officer of State in 1593 and from 1617 onwards.\n\nThe following have been identified as Treasurers of Scotland.\n\nThe final audited accounts of the Lord High Treasurer were public records of Scotland. These survive as an almost complete record from 1473 to 1635 at General Register House in Edinburgh. The manuscripts were published between 1877 and 1978 in thirteen volumes covering up to 1580.\n\n"}
