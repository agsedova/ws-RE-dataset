In all instances except rural areas these traditional garments have been replaced by Western clothing introduced by European colonialists.\n\nAfrican clothing and fashion is a diverse topic that is able to provide a look into different African cultures. Clothing varies from brightly colored textiles, to abstractly embroidered robes, to colorful beaded bracelets and necklaces. Since Africa is such a large and diverse continent, traditional clothing differs throughout each country. For example, many countries in West Africa have a “distinct regional dress styles that are the products of long-standing textile crafts in weaving, dyeing, and printing\", but these traditions are still able to coexist with western styles. A large contrast in African fashion is between rural and urban societies. Urban societies typically are exposed more to trade and the changing world, while it takes more time for new western trends to get to rural areas.\nPeople in Africa wear traditional cultureal clothing\nEuropean influence is commonly found in African fashion as well. For example, Ugandan men have started to wear “full length trousers and long-sleeved shirts”. On the other hand, women have started to adapt influences from “nineteenth-century Victorian dress”. These styles include: “long sleeves and puffed shoulders, a full skirt, and commonly a colorful bow tied around the waist”. This style of dress is called a busuti\".\" Another popular trend is to pair a piece of modern western clothing, such as T-shirts, with traditional wraps. Rural communities have also started to incorporate secondhand clothing/western clothing into their everyday style too. For example, rural Zambian women have started to combine “secondhand clothing with a single two-yard length of chitengi that was used as a wrapper over the dress”. With the globalization of western clothing influence from urban to rural areas, it has now become more common to find people wearing a variety of styles of clothes.\nIn Northeastern Africa, particularly in Egypt, styles of traditional women's clothing have been influenced by Middle Eastern culture; this can be exemplified by the simply embroidered Jelabiya which are similarly worn in the Gulf states. The djellaba (worn in Northwest Africa) shares similar properties with the Grand boubou, the dashiki, and the Senegalese kaftan.\nIn Nigeria, women wear head ties.\nIn Sahelian Africa, the dashiki, Senegalese kaftan, and the grand boubou are worn more prominently, though not exclusively (the Bògòlanfini, for instance, is worn in Mali). The dashiki is highly stylized and is rendered with an ornate V-shaped collar. In contrast the grand boubou is simpler, even more so than the djellaba, though the color designs reach impressive proportions, especially among the Tuareg, who are known for their dyed indigo robes.\n\nIn East Africa, the kanzu is the traditional dress worn by Swahili-speaking men. Women wear the kanga and the gomesi.\n\nIn Southern Africa, distinctive shirts are worn, like the long dresses they wear. For instance, South Africa is known for the Madiba shirt, whereas Zimbabwe is known for the safari shirt.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, the attire varies by country. In Ethiopia, men wear the Ethiopian suit and women wear the habesha kemis. In Somalia, men wear the khamis with a small cap called a koofiyad.\n\nThere exist non-profit organizations in all western societies that sell used clothes to for-profit companies in Africa. These \"white man's clothes\" are quite common in some parts of the continent. This used clothing is called \"Mitumba\" in some areas and is surrounded by some controversy. Critics point to it as a threat to local clothing manufacturers and complain that it exploits consumers. Others argue that this used clothing provides useful competition for often expensive and low quality local products.\n\nBefore charitable organizations started importing used clothes, cheap cotton clothing from Asia was the biggest import of cotton clothing to Africa. Soon, western charitable organizations began to send used clothing to African refugees and the poor. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are one of the top destinations for the import of used clothing. Although used clothing was commonly sent for the lower class communities, it is now commonly found within other social classes in Africa. Secondhand clothing is found in everyday apparel for many people, regardless of their class difference. This is because there was always a variety of clothing and it was a good price. However, typically in Muslim regions, such as North Africa, do not partake in this trade due to religious reasons. Instead, Islamic African men wear a long flowing robe and women wear hijab along with a dress covering all skin.\n\nAlthough these clothes are often donated by organizations in belief that people in rural and poor areas will be obtaining them first, the people who live in the cities get the clothing first. Since urban areas are full of fast and changing lifestyles, they are able to adapt to the change in cultures, such as change in tradition dress. These foreign clothes often are drastically different than what people are used to in more rural parts of Africa. People may believe that they are being insulted by being given something that they believe to be old, tattered and dirty. Generally, it seems that most countries have adapted to the use of secondhand clothing and have used it to their advantage.\n\nImpacts of Secondhand Clothes\n\nThe second hand clothing industry has left both positive and negative impacts within African society. An impact that one would commonly not think of is the resale of imported western clothing. South Africa, among other nations, has created a legislation of imported/donated good in order to curb the resale of the donated items. Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Kenya and Malawi had to completely ban the importation/donation of second hand clothes in order to try to control the resale. Another negative impact is that is commonly argued is that the importation of western clothing is leaving a negative impact on local clothing producers. However, the opposite side of the argument believes that the high importation creates new jobs for the people living in the port cities. These jobs include the sorting, washing, re-tailoring and transporting of the clothes to the markets. There is a report that revealed that “50,000 people are employed in jobs relating to secondhand clothing in one market in Kampala, Uganda”.\n\nAnother impact that could be argued either negatively or positively, is that secondhand clothing has become more common to wear than classic African textiles. In Zambia, secondhand clothing has basically become a new type of traditional clothing to them. Zambian cities are full of used clothing markets, which are extremely successful. Since Zambians have been wearing more western clothes traditional textiles and crafts have seemed to become scarce. While Senegal and Nigeria prefer to “follow long-standing regional style conventions, dressing with pride for purposes of displaying locally produced cloth in “African” styles”. It can be argued that Zambia is losing a piece of its culture by wearing only western styles or even that people in Senegal and Nigeria are not open minded enough to try to incorporate western styles into their fashion. These differences in beliefs in used clothing help make African fashion a diverse topic.\n\nSouth Africa, with an estimate of more than 57 million people from countless backgrounds, ethnicities and religions, holds in it an immense cultural diversity that is expressed through the vast array of topics ranging from cuisine, music, languages to celebrations. Fashion, connecting closely with one’s daily life, also plays a crucial role in the identification of South African’s culture and people, merely as it does every elsewhere in the world. Each piece of clothing people choose to put on can be simply because it is in their reach, or used as an expression of style as well as political, religious beliefs and perspective in life. No matter how it was chosen, every single piece of clothing contains a long history in it.\n\nPrecolonial:\n\nOne of the earliest vestiges of South African attire was traced back to around 2000 years ago when Middle Paleolithic population’ descendants, the Khoisan, settled in Cape Peninsula in the south-western extremity of the African continent. These people were divided into 2 groups which were the San whose life depended heavily on hunting and gathering, and the Khoikoi who were pastoral herders. Without the contacts with foreigners, garments and cloth were unavailable for them to import. Instead, these early settlers altered available resources such as game and domestic animals' softened skin, and sometimes, plants and ostrich eggshell for attire making. In addition to these sources, the introduction of metal also gave them more choices for fashion. The arrival of the Khoisan people were followed shortly after by groups of Bantu-speaking people, who, through the Bantu expansion, ended up with conflict and occupied the land of the Khoisan people, forcing them into dispersion and absorption into the Bantu-speaking community. The settlement of Bantu-speaking people resulted in the formation of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe, from 900-1300 A.D., that flourished with trades from other foregin regions for gold and ivory in the exchange of clothes, glass bead and Chineses porcelain. Bantu-speaking’s inhabitants in South Africa also lead to the derivation of nowadays main groups of people in south africa which are the Nguni speaking people includes four smaller groups (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele). The other groups of people in South Africa are the Sotho–Tswana peoples (Tswana, Pedi, and Sotho), while  with the group of people in the north-eastern areas of present-day South Africa who are Venda, Lemba, and Tsonga. All of these groups of people, share the common home of South Africa, have for themselves distinctive languages and culture .  \n\nColonial:\n\nColonization starting from the mid seventeenth century undoubtedly changed South Africa in all aspects, and fashion together all those changes was influenced heavily by the arrival of new materials from Europe as well as the Eurocentric view about the body and clothing, perceiving that South African dressed like necked imposed changes on traditional fashion of these ideginous groups of people. Traditional clothing made with local materials were incorporated with new style and items from Europe. In the early nineteenth century, glass beads and plastic beads from Europe added new materials to the traditional collection of materials that South African indigenous people used to make beadworks. Around the late nineteenth century, Isishweshwe fabric was introduced to South Africa through importation from England and Germany. The cloth was made with indigo dye and later, with synthetic form of indigo dye with a range of colors ranging from blue and red to maroon and brown, associated with decorations from replicated and orderly organized geometric patterns. Isishweshwe slowly blended itself to the fashion world of South African people, appearing on clothing of working class people, rural women and male soldiers. Though popular, because it was imported from other countries, was not recognized as what is unique for African fashion until 1982 when South African a company, Da Gama Textiles, began producing the cloths that helped to push its status to be considered as South Africa representative type of fabric. With the influence of colonizers, Western fashion came to rule over South Africa with educated class people preferred Edwardian top coats and hats. Working men also went with Western style that boost the demand for these products. Stores in these working areas carried out a wide variety of goods such as boots, coats, tweed jackets, waistcoats, shirts, braces, belts, hats, handkerchiefs, and pocket watches.\n\nApartheid period:\n\nDuring this era of classifying people by their ethnicities and races, the unique dresses of each South African indigenous community were used as one of the distinction tools. However, besides that, wearing traditional dress also acted as a way for South African coloured people to express their resistance and displeasure with the government ruled by a minority of white people. Traditional clothes were worn by leaders such as Nelson Mandela, who put on a Xhosa traditional garment, in 1962 in his trial for attempting to overthrow the government. The expression of his identity as a true South African person spoke for the aggression in resistance and asking for one’s won control of one’s country. With traditional dresses were worn as part of expressing one’s identity, South African fashion in the aparthied period witnessed the continuing growth of influence from European fashion. The bridge between of pre-aparthied fashion when clothing in South Africa depended heavily on European fashion import and post-aparthied fashion when celebrating one’s ethnicity was built by many South African designers who brought a touch of Africa to European style clothing. One noticeable example is Marianne Fassler who incorporated leopard-print with clothing in European style. She took inspiration from South African sources from clothing of indigenous groups of people to artists such as Barbara Tyrrell and Marlene Dumas.\n\nPost-aparthied:\n\nAfter the aparthied period ended in 1994, South African traditional dresses continue to be the way to express pride in one’s nation and identity as well as an enormous source of inspiration for famous fashion brands such as Sun Goddess, Stoned Cherrie and Strangelove. Pieces such as head wraps and A-line skirt inspired by Xhosa people from the nineteenth century were brought back on the runway. South African fashion is a coming together of different style, culture and response to social circumstances. It’s a hybrid between African people themselves and foreigners they interacted with. For its diversity, no single style of dress is stated as national dress, but rather each group of people has a distinctive way to dress themselves.\n\n"}

The main source of ethylmercury is thiomersal.\n\nEthylmercury (CHHg) is a substituent of compounds: it occurs as a component of compounds of the formula CHHgX where X = chloride, thiolate, or another organic group. Most famously X = the mercaptide group of thiosalicylic acid as in thiomersal. In the body, ethylmercury is most commonly encountered as derivatives with a thiolate attached to the mercury. In these compounds, Hg(II) has a linear or sometimes trigonal coordination geometry. Given the comparable electronegativities of mercury and carbon, the mercury-carbon bond is described as covalent.\n\nThe toxicity of ethylmercury is well studied.\n\nConcerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999, but remains in all multi dose vaccines and flu shots (though many single use vaccines with no thiomersal are available). Clarkson has argued that risk assessments based on methylmercury were overly conservative, in light of observations that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury. Moreover, Clarkson has argued that inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury, despite its much longer half-life in the brain, is much less toxic than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.\n\n\n\n"}

Her grandfather was one of Frankfurt's first social-democratic aldermen. At 14, she joined the Socialist Worker Youth, and at 18 became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\" – SPD). She worked avidly in the women's movement. In Frankfurt, she became friends with Eleonore Wolf, whose life was taking a similar path.\n\nDuring the First World War, Kirchner, now a mother of two daughters, busied herself in communal welfare, dedicating herself to needy women's and children's welfare. After that, she worked in the Workers' Welfare organization (\"Arbeiterwohlfahrt\"; AWO), which she founded together with Marie Juchacz in 1919. Her special concern here was children who were underfed as a result of the war and the widespread inflation that struck Germany later. Many of these children suffered from damaged health and stunted growth. They had had their childhood taken away from them by events over which they had no control. Kirchner took many of these children to Switzerland for their health. During the \"Ruhrkampf\", a brief civil war in Germany in 1920, Kirchner helped evacuate thousands of children from the Ruhr district, sending them to stay with families in Hesse.\n\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power, and the dedicated anti-fascist had to go underground, as her help in freeing an anti-Nazi from the Gestapo became known, leading to the danger of her possible arrest. She fled, without her family, to Saarbrücken, which was then still under League of Nations administration. There she worked at kitchen jobs and as a waitress, also caring for German émigrés through, among other means, the Persecuted Anti-Fascists' Aid Committee ().\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, Kirchner fled to Forbach, Metz (both in Alsace-Lorraine, France), and then finally Paris. Even while abroad, she helped the resistance movement in Germany: she led the Saar Refugees' Committee (\"Saarflüchtlingskommitee\"), drew up plans and reports for the SPD's executive in exile, and produced and distributed illegal leaflets.\n\nEven though Kirchner belonged to the SPD and Eleonore Wolf did illegal work for the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), they worked quite closely together in the Saar region as they organized the emigration of many officials of the workers' movement out of the Reich. (See: Red Help). From this they also published, under Wolfgang Abendroth's editorship \"die Einheit der Arbeiterbewegung in der antifaschistischen Arbeit\" (\"The Unity of the Workers' Movement in Anti-Fascist Work\").\n\nIn 1942, Kirchner was arrested by the Vichy Régime and handed over to the Gestapo. She was sentenced to ten years' hard labour (\"Zuchthaus\") for treason, the first year of which she spent in a prison in Cottbus, which she shared with several female members of the Red Orchestra resistance group, whose goal was to hasten the Nazi régime's collapse. These women's solidarity greatly helped Kirchner overcome the ordeal of being thrown in prison. However, Kirchner's case was brought back before the \"Volksgerichtshof\" in 1944. This time, Roland Freisler, the Chief Justice at the \"Volksgerichtshof\", sentenced her to death, and she was beheaded at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. The judgment accused Kirchner of having \"treasonably rooted herself in the evilest Marxist high-treason propaganda\". It also accused her of \"treasonably gathering cultural, economic, political, and military intelligence and communicating\" the same.\n\n\"Keep Goethe's words in mind,\" wrote Kirchner in a letter to her children on the day of her death, \"'Die and become'. Don't cry for me. I believe in a better future for you.\"\n\nSince 1990, the city of Frankfurt am Main, Kirchner's birthplace, has yearly awarded the Johanna Kirchner Medal to those who fight against oppression, and stand up against terror, torture, and murder.\n\n\n"}

It is the world's highest health policy setting body and is composed of health ministers from member states.\n\nThe members of the WHA generally meet every year in May in Geneva at the Palace of Nations, the location of WHO Headquarters. The main tasks of the WHA are to decide major policy questions, as well as to approve the WHO work programme and budget and elect its Director-General (every fifth year) and annually to elect ten members to renew part of its Executive Board. Its main functions are to determine the policies of the Organization, supervise financial policies, and review and approve the proposed programme budget.\n\nThe original membership of the WHA, at the first assembly held in 1948, numbered 55 member states. The WHA has, currently, 194 member states.\n\nIn addition, six agencies have observer status at the WHA – the Vatican, the Palestinian Authority, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the South Centre organization, and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\nThe Assembly is governed by \"Rules of Procedure of the World Health Assembly\"; agenda items are set by the General Committee of the Assembly, a group of 25 individuals that includes the President and subcommittee chairs, and a number of delegates elected by the Assembly previous.\n\nThe Department of Health of the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, was invited on 28 April 2009 to participate in the WHA 2009 as an observer for the first time since losing its China seat in United Nations to People's Republic of China in 1971. The invitation was extended to \"the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei.\" Since 2017, it has been completely excluded from the WHA.\n\nEach year, the WHA elects members from among its ranks to renew the Executive Board (EB). This body is governed in Chapter VI, Articles 24 through 29, of the Constitution of the WHO. The EB must have an equitable geographic distribution, and \"shall be elected for three years and may be re-elected... The Board shall meet at least twice a year and shall determine the place of each meeting.\" This is invariably chosen (by consensus) to be Geneva. A current list of members on the Executive Board can be derived through consultation of the WHA #Annual Assemblies summaries which are posted below.\n\nThe main international policy frameworks adopted through WHA resolutions include:\n\nIn addition, the WHA has endorsed through resolutions a number of WHO action plans dealing with different areas to improve health around the world, such as:\n\nThe WHA is also responsible for the endorsement of the WHO Family of International Classifications, a series of internationally standardized medical classifications, including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).\n\nThe focus of the 61st WHA was public health. Participants from 190 countries attended, with a record 2704 delegates. Important briefings and resolutions involved intellectual property barriers in research and development; combatting non-communicable diseases and female genital mutilation; campaigns to support breastfeeding and to decrease abuse of alcohol and tobacco; immunization practices, including adoption of the term \"pharma fraud\"; and health issues facing migrants.\n\nIn her role as global patron of The White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, and chair of the Maternal Mortality Campaign, Sarah Brown gave the keynote speech at the World Health Organization's 62nd WHA, alongside United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, asking \"Where is the M in MCH?’ [maternal and child health]\" in an echo of Allan Rosenfield's landmark \"Lancet\" article of 1985 – and highlighting that the numbers of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth were still the same 14 years later.\n\nAmong other actions, the 65th Assembly endorsed the Rio Political Declaration to address the social determinants of health, intended to spearhead support for all countries to adopt inclusive ‘\"Health For All\"’ approaches to health promotion. It also endorsed the first World Immunization Week.\n\nIn her address to the 66th WHA in May 2013, DGWHO Margaret Chan traced a brief history of revisions to the International Health Regulations following the SARS outbreak in 2002-3, the \"first severe new disease of the 21st century.\" She observed that the two new diseases WHO is dealing with in 2013 are the novel coronavirus (MERS), from the same family as SARS, detected in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and the first-ever human infections with the H7N9 avian influenza virus reported in China in 2013. She attributed the positive report by the \"World Health Statistics\" (May 2013) on dramatic improvement in health in the world's poorest countries from 1993–2013, to the emphasis placed on poverty alleviation by the Millennium Development Goals. She announced the emergence of global action plans for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, and the prevention of avoidable blindness and visual impairment calling for a life course approach which includes \"equity through universal health coverage,\" preventive strategies and \"integrated service delivery.\"\n\nChan declared at the assembly that intellectual property, or patents on strains of new virus, should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations. Following the 2012 MERS outbreak, Saudi Arabia Deputy Minister of Health Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who applied for a patent would not allow the MERS-Coronavirus to be used for investigations by other scientists and were, therefore, delaying the development of diagnostic tests. Ten of the 22 people who died and 22 of 44 cases reported were in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia–based microbiologist Ali Mohamed Zaki reported the first known case, a 60-year-old Saudi man who got sick in June, 2012 on ProMed-mail, a public health on-line forum then published more details including the virus’s genetic makeup and closest relatives. The Erasmus Medical Center \"tested, sequenced and identified\" a sample provided by Ali Mohamed Zaki. Erasmus MC and Dr. Zaki strongly refuted all allegations concerning a presumed lack of willingness to cooperate in research into the new MERS coronavirus, making diagnostic tests and virus specimens freely available to all research institutions around the globe.\n\nThe 67th WHA took place in Geneva on 19–24 May 2014. Among the more than 20 resolutions adopted by the Assembly included ones concerning strengthening of national drug management systems to address antimicrobial resistance; implementation of the Minamata Convention to protect human health and the environment from effects of exposure to mercury and mercury compounds; and improving access to essential medicines worldwide. Also endorsed was a global monitoring framework for maternal, infant and child nutrition.\n\nFollowing the 67th WHA, DGWHO Chan was criticized by the Association of Correspondents Accredited to the United Nations (ACANU) for not having spoken directly to the media during the course of the Assembly.\n\nThe 68th session of the WHA took place in Geneva 18–26 May 2015. Jagat Prakash Nadda assumed the presidency of WHA. India assumed the presidency after a gap of 19 years.\n\nDuring the assembly the WHA agreed to the Global Malaria Strategy and Programme Budget for 2016–2017, polio, International Health Regulations, strengthening surgical care, WHO's reform of its emergency and response programme, antimicrobial resistance, immunization gaps, malnutrition, air pollution, and epilepsy. Annual health awards were given by the DGWHO and the President of WHA.\n\nThe 69th World Health Assembly took place 23–28 May 2016, and agreed to pursue the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a comprehensive set of foundational steps, prioritizing universal health coverage, working with actors outside the health sector to address the social, economic and environmental root causes of antimicrobial resistance and other human health problems, to continue expanding efforts to address poor maternal and child health and infectious diseases in developing countries, and to focus upon equity within and between countries. Delegates decided to invite the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s (WHO FCTC) Conference of the Parties (COP) to provide information on outcomes of this biennial event to future World Health Assembly meetings.\n\nThe 70th World Health Assembly took place 22–31 May 2017.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, Chinese Taipei was completely excluded from the WHA, following the election of Tsai Ing-wen and subsequent political pressure from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Mainland China stated that the role of Chinese Taipei as an observer to attend WHA between 2008 and 2016 was based on a consensus between the Ma Ying-jeou Administration and Mainland China, as well as resolution WHA25.1 \"Representation of China in the World Health Organization\" (1972). As the Tsai Ing-wen Administration did not recognize the \"1992 Consensus\" as the Ma Ying-jeou Administration did, the People's Republic of China had withdrawn its endorsement of Chinese Taipei to attend WHA as an observer.\n\nThe 71st World Health Assembly took place 21–26 May 2018.\n\nAustralia, Chile, China, Djibouti, Finland, Gabon, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Romania, Sudan, and United States of America were elected to the Executive Board.\n\nThe 72nd World Health Assembly took place 20–28 May 2019. Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Grenada, Guyana, Kenya, Singapore, Tajikistan, Tonga, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates were elected to the Executive Board. The President of WHA72 was Dr Bounkong Syhavong of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\n\nThe 73rd World Health Assembly took place virtually, through electronic media, 18 and 19 May 2020. One problem was the fact that, in the interval of one year between the WHA72 declaration of Geneva as the location of the WHA73 and the occurrence, the airlines of the world had been collapsed by the coronavirus and so few people could physically be in Geneva on the prescribed dates of WHA73. The \"Special Procedures\" document was suggested by the Executive Board to allow a virtual \"de minimis\" WHA73, and contained as Annex the \"Special Procedures\" guideline, in order that it might be passed at the earliest possible juncture during WHA73. As there was to be in operation only the Plenary session, all decisions would be taken there. In practice, this meant a) that the decisions were reduced to one vote, on the adoption of the seven-page motion (discussed below) and b) that the heavy lifting and consensus building was done offline and before 18 May, in order for a meaningful vote to be obtained on 19 May with what turned out to be the seven-page consensus motion.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned travel restrictions, Bahamian civil servant Keva Bain was selected President of WHA73 from amongst the Permanent Representatives of member governments to the WHO.\n\nOn Monday 18 May, Australia and the EU tabled a seven-page motion which was supported by over 120 delegations. The Australian delegation hardened the tone of the original European text, to include the qualifiers \"impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\", to the text of OP9.10 \"as appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to COVID-19\", \"using existing mechanisms (including an IHR Review Committee and the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme)\". The Aus-EU motion passed with unanimity. The final motion calls for the review to be coordinated by the WHO itself. The proposal for a supplementary agenda item, \"Inviting Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer\", did not receive consideration although it was tendered by 14 independent states.\n\nThe WHA73 was largely composed of two-minute statements by each world leader; in fact these statements overflowed into day two. At the virtual opening, President Xi Jinping of China pledged that the People's Republic of China will: 1) make its COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment a global public good once available, and contribute to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries; 2) provide $2 billion USD over two years to help with COVID-19 response, especially in developing countries; 3) establish a cooperation mechanism for its hospitals to pair up with 30 African hospitals and accelerate the building of the Africa CDC headquarters to help the continent ramp up its disease preparedness and control capacity. The position that the Republic of China be admitted to the WHA as an observer earned strong verbal support from the United States, Paraguay, Haiti, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Belize, Saint Lucia, Palau, St Kitts and Nevis and Tuvalu. The Russian delegation, which was elected on day two to the Executive Board of the WHO over the misgivings of an unknown delegation, objected strenuously to the Ukrainian delegation's remark on the degraded health in the TOTU population owing, felt the Ukrainians, to unwanted territorial expansion by Russia. The Russian delegation disclaimed involvement in the TOTU, including the Republic of Crimea which has been a member of the Russian Federation for over five years but is unrecognized by the international community of which the WHA forms part.\n\nTen members of the Executive Board were elected on day two, from Botswana, Colombia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, India, Madagascar, Oman, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Republic of China was invited under the name Chinese Taipei as an observer to the WHA for 8 years between 2008 and 2016, based on \"a consensus between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait\" (namely, the Ma Ying-jeou Administration and Mainland China) and resolution WHA25.1 \"Representation of China in the World Health Organization\" in 1972. However, since the 70th WHA in 2017, the People's Republic of China has continued to block the participation of the Republic of China in the WHA as an observer. United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar has voiced support for the Republic of China's inclusion in WHA as an observer. WHO Principal Legal Officer Steven Solomon had in early May 2020 on this subject a press conference, wherein he describes the issues and gives interesting answers when pressed about the similarity of this subject to the invitation of Palestine. Solomon pointed to Article 18(h) of the Constitution, which states that the Assembly has power: \"to invite any organization, international or national, governmental or non-governmental... but in the case of national organizations, invitations shall be issued only with the consent of the Government concerned.\" Palestine has been invited to attend as an observer \"based on, and with reference to, resolution WHA27.37, as further clarified by resolution WHA53.13 \".\n\n\n"}

Once her patent issued in 28 December 1886, she founded Garis-Cochrane Manufacturing Company to manufacture her machines. Cochrane showed her new machine at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 where nine Garis-Cochran washers were installed in the restaurants and pavilions of the fair and was met with interest from restaurants and hotels, where hot water access was not an issue. She won the highest prize for \"best mechanical construction, durability and adaptation to its line of work\" at the Fair. Garis-Cochran Manufacturing Company, which built both hand and power operated dishwashers, grew through a focus on hotels and other commercial customers and was renamed as Cochran’s Crescent Washing Machine Company in 1897.\nCochran's Crescent Washing Machine Company became part of KitchenAid through acquisition by Hobart Manufacturing Company after Cochran's death in 1913, who first grew the commercial business, and in 1949, the first KitchenAid dishwasher based on Cochran's design was introduced to the public. By the 1950s, most households had access to hot water which had been limited in the past and cultural attitudes regarding the role of women were shifting so the consumer home market opened for dishwashers in the 1950s. Cochran was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for patent 355,139 issued on December 28, 1886 for her invention of the dishwasher.\n\nShe was born Josephine Garis in Ashtabula County, Ohio, on March 8, 1839 and raised in Valparaiso, Indiana. Cochrane was the daughter of John Garis, a civil engineer, and Irene Fitch Garis.\n\nAfter moving to her sister‘s home in Shelbyville, Illinois, she married William Cochran on October 13, 1858. William had returned the year before from a disappointing try at the California Gold Rush, but had gone on to become a prosperous dry goods merchant and Democratic Party politician. Josephine and William had 2 children: Hallie and Katharine.\n\nIn 1870 the family moved into a mansion and she joined Chicago society. After one event dinner party, some of the heirloom dishes got chipped while washing up, prompting her to search for a better alternative to handwashing the china. She also wanted to relieve tired housewives from the duty of washing dishes after a meal. \n\nCochrane died of a stroke or exhaustion in Chicago, Illinois, on August 3, 1913, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery in Shelbyville, Illinois. In 2006 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\n\nThe first few men she tried to hire to put her design into reality insisted on changing her design, and the results didn’t work. Other attempts had been made to produce a commercially viable dishwasher. In 1850 Joel Houghton designed a hand-cranked dish soaker. In the 1860s, L. A. Alexander improved on the device with a geared mechanism that allowed the user to spin racked dishes through a tub of water. Neither of these devices was particularly effective.\n\nCochrane designed the first model of her dishwasher in the shed behind her house in Shelbyville, Illinois. George Butters was a mechanic who assisted her in the construction of the dishwasher; he was also an employee at the first dishwasher factory. To build the machine, she first measured the dishes and built wire compartments, each specially designed to fit either plates, cups, or saucers. The compartments were placed inside a wheel that lay flat inside a copper boiler. A motor turned the wheel while hot soapy water squirted up from the bottom of the boiler and rained down on the dishes. Her dishwasher was the first to use water pressure instead of scrubbers to clean the dishes inside the machine. After receiving a patent on December 28, 1886\n\nThe Garis-Cochran Manufacturing Company became part of KitchenAid, and in 1949, the first KitchenAid dishwasher based on Cochran's design was introduced. It was in the 1950s that dishwashers became a common household item after new suburban homes were built with the plumbing required to handle the extra hot water.\n"}

His main interests are atomic physics, condensed matter physics and many-body physics. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.\n\nDuring the last ten years, the group of H.T.C. Stoof has been involved in the study of various aspects of the physics of ultracold atomic gases. In addition, they performed research on skyrmion lattices in the quantum Hall effect and collective modes in supersolid 4He. Below the results obtained from the study of degenerate Fermi gases are briefly summarized.\n\nAlready in 1996 they predicted that an atomic gas of 6Li (a fermionic isotope of lithium) becomes a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid at experimentally obtainable temperatures. They have also performed a detailed study of the superfluid behaviour of this gas below the critical temperature. Motivated by this work, at least six experimental groups from around the world, including the groups of R. Grimm, R.G. Hulet, D.S. Jin, and W. Ketterle, started trying to achieve the necessary conditions for the BCS transition in 6Li.\nIn the last seven years the study of superfluidity in Fermi gases has been at the center of attention of the ultracold atoms community. It is fair to say that the very successful experiments, that ultimately have led to the creation of the superconductor with, as a fraction of the Fermi energy, the highest critical temperature ever, have only been possible due to the use of so-called Feshbach resonances. These resonances were theoretically co-discovered by H.T.C. Stoof in the alkalis in 1993.\nAt that time, the full potential of a Feshbach resonance for studying the crossover from a BCS superconductor of Bose-Einstein condensed Cooper pairs to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecules was not realized yet, but this crossover is now well understood due to the strong connection between experiment and \"ab initio\" theory that is possible in this field. The group has made important contributions to the present understanding of how many-body physics affects the BEC-BCS crossover, and how to incorporate the two-body physics of the Feshbach resonance exactly into the many-body theory. Henk Stoof was elected as an APS Fellow for these contributions.\n\nIn the last three years, the group of R.G. Hulet at Rice and the group of W. Ketterle at MIT have pioneered the experimental study of spin imbalance on the superfluid state. These experiments have especially concentrated on the strongly interacting or unitarity limit exactly at resonance where the attraction between the atoms is as large as quantum mechanics allows. Again, the group of H.T.C. Stoof made important contributions to this topic. For example, they were first to predict the topology of the universal phase diagram of this unitarity gas, that is now confirmed by the experiments and that contains a tricritical temperature below which the gas phase separates between an (almost) equal density superfluid and a polarized normal gas. Making use of renormalization group techniques, they are up to now the only theoretical group that has been able to accurately calculate this strong-coupling tricritical temperature from first principles. They believe that an important reason for the success in this area of physics is that they have a background in both the microscopic atomic physics and in the macroscopic condensed-matter physics. It is only through a combination of this knowledge that one can arrive at sophisticated many-body theories that can be directly compared with experiment without any fitting parameters.\n\n"}

Ahmet Zappa and Tanya Memme hosted all three seasons while Tanika Ray only hosted the first season with Dan Danknick replacing her for the second and third seasons.\n\nEach preliminary show in the first season of \"Robotica\" featured four robots weighing as much as 210 pounds paired off in a series of three challenges. The winners of each pairing faced each other in a Robot-sumo style \"Fight to the Finish\" to determine the winner of the show.\n\n\nTotal points were added for the three events to determine a winner. In the event of a tie, the robot who won the greater number of events advanced.\n\nThe Fight to The Finish took place on a 16' by 16' platform elevated high above the floor. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute and then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.\n\nThe finals worked the same way as the preliminary shows, except there were six robots, competing in three pairs. Three robots met in the Fight to the Finish. The winner of the show was awarded the largest cash prize in robot combat to that date: $12,000.\n\n\"Robotica\" seasons 2 and 3 featured redesigned challenges. The Speedway was eliminated, The Gauntlet was redesigned, and The Maze had been completely re-done and renamed The Labyrinth.\n\nThe former side-by-side Gauntlet course was now arranged in a diamond-shape. The first barrier wall was now a wooden plank, the walls of metal cans, bricks, and concrete paving stones remained, and the safe was gone. Each robot had to complete their own two legs of the diamond and then return through the opponent's rubble field before climbing a ramp up to the Forest of Glass in the center of the diamond. When all the glass strips were broken, a final glass sheet lowered as the final challenge. Scoring was 10 points for each barrier, 5 points for each rubble wall, 10 points for first up the ramp, 5 points for second up the ramp, 15 points for the final glass pane. This challenge had 150 total points available and a three-minute time limit.\nThe former two-path Maze was now a single Labyrinth wherein both robots could roam to choose from six scoring obstacles. Also roaming the Labyrinth were two rat-shaped robots named the \"Robotica Rats\" that could interfere with (or sometimes help) the competitors. Breaking the glass strip beyond each obstacle claimed the points. Obstacles were:\nRobots started together in a motorized rotating turntable, where combat was encouraged. A robot could be penalized the entire point total for an obstacle if they broke down or got stuck in a position that blocked access to the obstacle.\n\nAt the end of three minutes, or when all the obstacles were cleared, the exit opened. The final glass strip on the far side of the exit was worth 30 points. This challenge had 150 total points available and a four-minute time limit.\n\nThe winning pair of robots faced each other in The Fight to The Finish. The platform was enlarged from season 1; it was now a 25' by 25' elevated platform. A new rule called for robots to hold the other robot 'pinned' for no more than 15 seconds before release. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute, then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.\n\nFor the finals, three pairs of robots competed in The Gauntlet. The two robots with the lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining four robots paired off for The Labyrinth.

She is best known for her roles as April Stevens Ewing on the American primetime television series \"Dallas\" (1986–1991) and as Alex Cahill-Walker on the television series \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" (1993–2001).\n\nWilson was born in Rochester, Minnesota. The daughter of two IBM executives, Wilson moved to Colorado at the age of nine and graduated from Fairview High School. In 1981, she received a degree in fashion merchandising and business from the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nWhile working in Denver on a fashion shoot, one of the photographers mistook Wilson for a model and then introduced her to a New York modeling agent who signed her on the spot. Wilson then moved to Manhattan, and within 18 months, she had appeared in over 30 commercial campaigns for Clairol, Sea Breeze, Keri-Lotion, and Maybelline. Her print work ran in such popular magazines as \"Mademoiselle\", \"Glamour\", and \"Redbook\".\n\nAfter three years of modeling, Wilson moved to Los Angeles for a career in acting. Her first roles included the black comedy film \"Crimewave\" (1984) directed by Sam Raimi, \"Velvet\" (1984), an ABC/Aaron Spelling television movie opposite Leah Ayres, Shari Belafonte, and Mary Margaret Humes, and a guest role on the espionage series \"Cover Up\" (1984). She had a lead role with Tim Robbins in the comedy motion picture \"Fraternity Vacation\" (1985) and also appeared in a CBS television miniseries \"Kane & Abel\" (1985) with Peter Strauss. This immediately led to \"Our Family Honor\" (1985-1986), an NBC drama about Irish cops versus the Mafia, in which she co-starred with Ray Liotta, Michael Madsen, and Eli Wallach. Her career continued to flourish with a role in the television movie \"News at Eleven\" (1986) alongside Martin Sheen.\n\nWilson gained the role as April Stevens Ewing on the CBS soap opera \"Dallas\" (1986–1991).

It is the sequel to the 1993 game \"The 7th Guest\".\n\nThe story opens 60 years after the events of \"The 7th Guest\". It is now 1995, and the player assumes the role of Carl Denning, an investigative reporter for the television series \"Case Unsolved\". Robin Morales, his producer and lover, mysteriously vanished three weeks prior in Harley-on-the-Hudson, New York. She was investigating a series of grisly murders and disappearances that had plagued the otherwise sleepy upstate town over the last few months. Denning's only solid lead is a portable computer called the GameBook delivered with only a postmark from Harley. When booted, the GameBook displays Robin's plea to help her escape.\n\nThe story then flashes back to the beginning of Robin's investigation. She interviews Eileen Wiley, the only person known to have survived an encounter with Henry Stauf's mansion. Eileen confirms she lost her hand that night, claiming it had been bitten off by a dog, but offers no other meaningful details of the encounter.\n\nSuspicious of Eileen's story, Robin interviews Dr. Thornton, who treated Eileen that night. Though the doctor appears to believe Eileen about the dog, the interview proves fruitful as Dr. Thornton reveals that Eileen was not alone that night; her friend Samantha Ford was with her in the house those 18 years ago. Samantha's family used its considerable influence to keep her involvement out of the papers. He also reveals that Samantha has been paralyzed from the waist down ever since the girls' encounter. Dr. Thornton's receptionist listens to the entire conversation through an intercom, demonstrating a strangely angry behavior.\n\nRobin attempts to interview Samantha, but their meeting is adversarial. Samantha's forceful denials convince Robin that the women are not telling the truth about their encounter. Samantha confirms Robin's suspicions later that evening when she visits Robin's motel room and shares her story. Samantha claims that during their encounter with the house, something supernatural held the girls down and raped them, then let them go. Samantha had an illegal abortion that resulted in her paralysis, but Eileen had a daughter, Marie. Samantha claims there was always something sinister about the child and believes that all hell let loose around Marie's 18th birthday, that Marie is the mansion's offspring, and that Marie is responsible for the murders and disappearances. Meanwhile, Robin begins to bud a romance with Jim Martin, the local police chief.\n\nRobin confronts Eileen with the story, and Eileen denies everything. Eileen then challenges Robin to go to the house herself. After Robin leaves it's revealed that Marie, who is Dr. Thornton's receptionist, was listening to the entire conversation again. Desperate to keep her secret from getting out, Marie commands her lover Chuck Lynch to murder Robin. It's revealed that Chuck and Marie were responsible for the recent murder spree: from time to time, at Marie's orders, Chuck would kill an innocent victim as a human sacrifice to \"feed\" the entity that inhabits Stauf's mansion. It is implied that Chuck, who is an adulterous business man, was getting benefits magically from the entity in exchange for the sacrifices. Chuck initially resists murdering Robin, worried about the media attention a famous disappearance would bring, but Marie convinces him by reminding him of the consequences for not helping Stauf. He enters Robin's hotel and stabs someone sleeping in bed, but he actually stabbed the police chief who had a budding romance with Robin. Unable to remove the knife, he takes the body to Stauf's mansion, where he is pulled inside and killed by Stauf for his mistake. Robin comes to the house soon after and enters as Samantha watches remotely, somehow having hacked into Stauf's surveillance. As Robin moves through the house, it psychologically breaks her by systematically confronting her with uncomfortable truths about her past.\n\nThe story then picks up with Carl in the mansion. Eventually Robin meets Stauf and he begins to tempt her into joining him, by enticing her with her own television network and other advantages she can get by serving the entity. Carl watches the conversation between them through the GameBook and unsuccessfully tries to convince Robin to just leave the mansion with him. As Robin ignores Carl's pleas and accepts Stauf's offer, Samantha breaks into the GameBook transmission and reveals that she was the one who sent the GameBook to Carl hoping that he could rescue Robin and warns him that it is too late now. Unable to leave Robin at first, Carl follows her cries upstairs where he meets Stauf, who is presiding over a game show called \"Let’s Make a Real Deal\" (a parody of Let's Make a Deal). Stauf explains that Carl must choose to open one of the doors, then offers Carl $600. Carl can keep it, or he can pay $200 and reveal what's behind one of the three doors in front of him. He pays to reveal door number two, which turns out to be a large TV. Next, he pays door number one, which is Marie. As Stauf tempts Carl with Marie's sexual prowess, Samantha hacks into the TV behind door number two, warning him not to give in to temptation as Stauf mocks her paralysis. Finally, Carl pays to reveal door number three, which is Robin. She expresses her love for Carl, pleading with him to choose her. Samantha urges Carl to choose her, revealing that this will end Stauf forever and that choosing either of the others will doom him. The game turns Carl's choice over to the player, which reveals one of three endings:\n\n\nOverall, the gameplay is similar to its predecessor's with the same puzzle-based gameplay structure, but with the additional element of a treasure hunt.\n\nAlthough Trilobyte stated in 1993 — even before \"The 7th Guest\" became available—that it planned to release \"The 11th Hour\" by October of that year, it was very late to market by over two years (eventually releasing in December 1995) and failed to meet sales expectations upon its release. Early into its development, a port to the 3DO was planned, and a release date of May 1994 was announced, but it was pushed back to March 1995, and ultimately cancelled.\n\nTrilobyte had confirmed that the game would be released on both the iPhone and iPad platforms. The release for iOS was scheduled for Q2/Q3 2011, but in March 2012 Trilobyte postponed the release indefinitely due to \"serious technical challenges\".\n\nIn April 2012, \"The 7th Guest: Book of Secrets\" application for iOS was renamed to just \"Book of Secrets\", and was updated to include a walkthrough and script for \"The 11th Hour\", just as it already had for \"7th Guest\".\n\nIn 2012, \"The 11th Hour\" was re-released for Windows, as a download from DotEmu and GOG.com. On October 18, 2013, it was re-released again on Steam, as part of a collaboration between Trilobyte and Night Dive Studios.\n\nThe makers of the game originally intended for it to contain more adult content in its cut scenes; the script for the game (published as part of a walk-through guide) included several R-rated sex scenes. Rumors immediately surfaced that an \"uncut\" version of \"11th Hour\" existed, leading to the game makers announcing that the R-rated sequences, though planned, were never filmed.\n\nMany of the videos that were filmed for the game used location shooting; the fifth scene utilised a blue screen incorporating a neutral blue drape. Macintosh Premier was used to convert the capture film into digitized images and videos. A program called 'Wavelet' was used to compress the game's videos.\n\nIt was developed by Trilobyte and used a later version of the Groovie graphic engine than that used by \"The 7th Guest\". \"The 11th Hour\" also features the music of George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger and Team Fat.\n\nReviews of the game upon initial release were mixed. After extensively praising the game's graphics, challenging puzzles, storyline, and atmosphere, as well as the lower amount of gratuitous gore when compared to \"The 7th Guest\", a reviewer for \"Maximum\" concluded \"However, the bottom line is that \"11th Hour\" is basically a more advanced version of \"7th Guest\".\" A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" also found the game much too similar to its predecessor, particularly as he considered the entire genre of puzzle adventures to be a waste of time. He also criticized that the game has long load times except when running on high-end computers. Arinn Dembo reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World. In 2010, UGO included the game in the article The 11 Weirdest Game Endings.\n\nBy April 1995, Trilobyte planned to launch \"The 11th Hour\" with a shipment of 250,000 copies. However, by December, retailers in the United States had ordered 500,000 units of the game. According to Geoff Keighley, \"\"The 11th Hour\" had the biggest ship-out of a PC game up until that point - nearly half a million units\". The game was a commercial success, with sales of nearly 300,000 copies in the United States alone by May 1996.\n\n\"The 11th Hour\" won the following awards:\n\n"}

{"id": "1831613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831613", "title": "Heroes of Might and Magic IV", "text": "Heroes of Might and Magic IV\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic IV is a turn-based strategy game developed by Gus Smedstad through New World Computing and published by the 3DO Company for Microsoft Windows-based personal computers in 2002. A Macintosh port was subsequently developed by Contraband Entertainment and released by the 3DO Company. The fourth installment of the popular \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" franchise, it is the sequel to \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\", and was the last to be developed by New World Computing.\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic IV\" introduced a number of major changes to the series.\n\nUnlike previous games, where they had little active role in combat, heroes became present on the battlefield with their troops. They can attack, and be attacked. If a hero is killed in combat he/she must be brought to a friendly town to be revived. It is possible to have armies with more than one hero, or with no heroes at all, although armies without a hero are incapable of performing certain tasks, such as capturing enemy towns or structures. \n\nThe skill system also underwent a significant overhaul, and all Heroes of a given class start out with the same skills. The player has significantly more control over the development of the Hero than in previous games in the series, and Heroes \"evolve\" into over 40 different specialized classes. A Hero can select up to five of the nine available primary skills, and each primary skill makes available three secondary skills. Each of these 36 skills have five levels of progression as opposed to the three levels in the previous games.\n\nBoth the adventure and combat maps were converted to a fixed-view isometric 3D display. The traditional hexagon-based battle grid was converted into a much higher-resolution square-based grid, making it easier to feature units of different sizes. Non-hero spellcasting units were given proper spell selections. Retaliation was allowed simultaneously with the attack, and ranged units were given the capability to retaliate against ranged attacks. Projectile attacks and spells now required direct line of sight to the target. \n\nEach individual troop unit was given its own movement allowance on the adventure map, with units possessing the ability to split off independently of the main army; however, the troops can no longer be \"shuttled\" from hero to hero to move an army large distances in a single turn. Logistics were restricted by eliminating or weakening travel spells. This, in turn, was partially compensated for by the elimination of the need to revisit resource-producing structures each week, and the introduction of caravans, which can quickly and safely transport heroes and remotely recruit troops from external dwellings.\n\nA small number of these skills are shared with earlier games, and some of the new skills can dramatically affect strategy (e.g., a Hero with Grandmaster Stealth is invisible to all non-allied units). Troop units may no longer be upgraded, and there are four recruitable ranks of units, down from seven. Each rank has two dwellings that can be built, but beyond the first rank, building one dwelling precludes the other. The creature dwellings themselves accumulate new creatures every day, as opposed to the start of each new week.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Heroes Chronicles: The Sword of Frost\", Gelu, the leader of AvLee's Forest Guard and wielder of Armageddon's Blade, attacks Kilgor, the Barbarian King of Krewlod, in an attempt to claim and destroy the Sword of Frost. As foretold by a prophecy, when Armageddon's Blade and the Sword of Frost clash in battle, the result is a massive explosion (known as the Reckoning), which destroys the world of Enroth. Many of the inhabitants of the planet, however, escape through mysterious portals that appear during the Reckoning that lead them to another world, called Axeoth – also the setting for \"Might and Magic IX\". Included among the refugees are many of the heroes of previous installments of the series, and many return to their old ways shortly after arriving on their new home.\n\nThe story of \"Heroes of Might and Magic IV\" unfolds primarily through the game's six campaigns, each of which establishes how the major kingdoms of one of Axeoth's continents were forged in the wake of the Reckoning, and the arrival of the Enrothian refugees on Axeoth. Each of the campaigns centers on a faction leader, and tells the story of how that leader came to prominence. Unlike \"Heroes of Might and Magic III\", all of the six campaigns are accessible from the beginning, and each unfolds as a stand-alone tale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo expansion packs were released for \"Heroes IV\": Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm (2002) and Heroes of Might and Magic IV: Winds of War (2003), both for Microsoft Windows only. \n\n\"The Gathering Storm\" offers six campaigns, more than 20 maps, 16 additional artifacts, four new creatures, and a multiplayer update. Each of the first five campaigns features a new specialty hero. \"The Gathering Storm\" also features an upgraded editor, which allows full access to new heroes, adventure objects, artifacts and creatures. A new soundtrack is also included.\n\n\"Winds of War\" introduces three new creatures and six new campaigns, which collectively tell the story of the invasion of the kingdom of Channon by the leaders of its five neighboring kingdoms. \"Winds of War\" was the last installment of the entire \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" series to be developed by New World Computing. Afterwards, the bankruptcy of the 3DO Company led to the sale of the \"Might and Magic\" franchise to Ubisoft for $1.3 million.\nIn the German market, \"Heroes of Might and Magic IV\" debuted at #5 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for April 2002. It climbed to fourth in its second month, before dropping to 12th and 19th in June and July, respectively.\n\nThe critic aggregator Metacritic determined that reviewers found the game to be generally favorable, with a weighted score of 84 out of 100. GameSpot wrote that \"Heroes IV is clearly a worthy successor to the series and has very clearly been worth the wait\", praising New World Computing for being \"able to incorporate so many new and interesting features into this sequel while still making sure it kept all the core elements that made all the previous games so great\". PC Gameworld was slightly less favorable, saying, \"The spark might be there, but it doesn’t burn as bright as it has in the past.\"\n\nThe expansions were less well received by professional reviewers, with metascores of 64 out of 100 for \"The Gathering Storm\" and 58 out of 100 for \"Winds of War.\"\n\n\"Heroes of Might and Magic IV\" was a nominee for \"The Electric Playground\"s 2002 \"Best Strategy Game for PC\" award, but lost to \"\".\n\n"}

She played Kristin Shepard in the television series \"Dallas\" (1979–1981, 1991).\n\nCrosby was born in Los Angeles, California, the only daughter of singer and actor Bing Crosby from his second marriage to actress Kathryn Grant. She graduated from high school at 15, after which she entered the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority, though she never graduated. She is fluent in Spanish. She was married to Eb Lottimer from 1978 to 1989 and, since 1998, has been married to Mark Brodka, with whom she has two children.\n\nCrosby played Kristin Shepard (Sue Ellen Ewing's scheming sister) on the prime time soap opera \"Dallas\" from 1979–81, and a further guest appearance in 1991. Her character is perhaps best remembered for her part in the cliffhanger ending of the 1979–1980 season of \"Dallas\", titled \"A House Divided\", which was resolved in the fourth episode of the following season, \"Who Done It\". In that highly watched episode, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) was shot by an unknown assailant. Viewers had to wait all summer (and most of the fall due to a Hollywood actors' strike) to learn whether J.R. would survive, and which of his many enemies was responsible. In the summer of 1980, the question, \"Who shot J.R.?\", was being asked in everyday conversations around the world.\n\nUltimately, Kristin Shepard was revealed to have been the person who pulled the trigger in the classic episode, which aired on November 21, 1980. It was one of the highest-rated episodes of a TV show ever aired. Her character, Kristin Shepard, later made an appearance on the \"Dallas\" spin-off series \"Knots Landing\" in 1980, before a brief return to \"Dallas\" in 1981. Once again the focus of a highly rated cliffhanger, it was revealed in the season opening episode (October 9, 1981) that it was Kristin's body floating in the Southfork Ranch swimming pool. She returned for the final episode of \"Dallas\" in 1991, playing the same character in a vision experienced by J.R.\n\nAfter \"Dallas\", Crosby starred in ABC miniseries \"Hollywood Wives\" (1985) and \"North and South, Book II\" (1986). She guest-starred on \"Hotel\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"\", \"\", \"Dream On\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", and \"In the Heat of the Night\".\n\nIn 1981, she played the leading role of a woman stalked in the remake of the Doris Day thriller \"Midnight Lace\". Other film credits include \"Last Plane Out\" (1983), \"The Ice Pirates\" (1984), \"Tapeheads\" (1988), and \"The Legend of Zorro\" (2005).\n\n"}

It is long with a maximum depth of 23,920 feet (7,290 metres). Its maximum depth is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean. The trench stretches from the Lesser Sunda Islands past Java, around the southern coast of Sumatra on to the Andaman Islands, and forms the boundary between Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian plate (more specifically, Sunda Plate). The trench is considered to be part of the Pacific Ring of Fire as well as one of a ring of oceanic trenches around the northern edges of the Australian Plate.\n\nIn 2005, scientists found evidence that the 2004 earthquake activity in the area of the Java Trench could lead to further catastrophic shifting within a relatively short period of time, perhaps less than a decade. This threat has resulted in international agreements to establish a tsunami warning system in place along the Indian Ocean coast.\n\nFor about half its length, off of Sumatra, it is divided into two parallel troughs by an underwater ridge, and much of the trench is at least partially filled with sediments. Mappings after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake of the plate boundary showed resemblance to suspension bridge cables, with peaks and sags, indicative of asperity and locked faults, instead of the traditional wedge shape expected.\n\nSome of the earliest exploration of the Trench occurred in the late 1950s when Robert Fisher, Research Geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, investigated the trench as part of a worldwide scientific field exploration of the world's ocean floor and sub-oceanic crustal-structure. Bomb-sounding, echo-train analysis and manometer were some of the techniques used to determine the depth of the trench. The research contributed to an understanding of the subduction characteristic of the Pacific margins. Various agencies have explored the trench in the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake, and these explorations have revealed extensive changes in the ocean floor.\n\nOn 5 April 2019 Victor Vescovo made the first manned descent to the deepest point of the trench in the Deep-Submergence Vehicle \"DSV Limiting Factor\" (a Triton 36000/2 model submersible) and measured a depth of ± by direct CTD pressure measurements at 11°7'44\" S, 114°56'30\" E. The operating area was surveyed by the support ship, the Deep Submersible Support Vessel \"DSSV Pressure Drop\", with a Kongsberg SIMRAD EM124 multibeam echosounder system. The gathered data will be donated to the GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. The dive was part of the Five Deeps Expedition. The objective of this expedition is to thoroughly map and visit the deepest points of all five of the world's oceans by the end of September 2019.\n\nTo resolve the debate regarding the deepest point of the Indian Ocean, the Diamantina Fracture Zone was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in March 2019, recording a maximum water depth of ± at 33°37'52\" S, 101°21'14\" E for the Dordrecht Deep. This confirmed that the Sunda Trench was indeed deeper than the Diamantina Fracture Zone.\n\nThe subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath a bloc of the Eurasian Plate is associated with numerous earthquakes. Several of these earthquakes are notable for their size, associated tsunamis, and/or the number of fatalities they caused.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On the research side, Internet studies intersects with studies of cyberculture, human–computer interaction, and science and technology studies.\n\n</onlyinclude>\nInternet and society is a research field that addresses the interrelationship of Internet and society, i.e. how society has changed the Internet and how the Internet has changed society.\n\nThe topic of social issues relating to Internet has become notable since the rise of the World Wide Web, which can be observed from the fact that journals and newspapers run many stories on topics such as cyberlove, cyberhate, Web 2.0, cybercrime, cyberpolitics, Internet economy, etc.\nAs most of the scientific monographs that have considered Internet and society in their book titles are social theoretical in nature, internet and society can be considered as a primarily social theoretical research approach of Internet studies.\n\nIn recent years, Internet studies have become institutionalized as courses of study at several institutions of higher learning, including the University of Oxford, Harvard University, London School of Economics, Curtin University of Technology, Brandeis University, Endicott College, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Appalachian State University and the University of Minnesota.\n\nDisciplines that contribute to Internet studies include:\n\nA number of academic journals are central to communicating research in the field, including \"Bad Subjects\", \"Convergence: The Journal of Research into New media Technologies\", \"Ctheory\", \"Cyber Psychology + Behaviour\", \"Computers in Human Behavior\", \"First Monday\", \"Information, Communication, and Society\", \"The Information Society\", \"Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication\", \"M/C\", \"New Media & Society\", \"tripleC: Journal for a Global Sustainable Information Society\", \"Fibreculture Journal\", and \"TeknoKultura\", but research relating to internet studies appears in a diverse range of venues and disciplines.\n\nKey foundational work, that developed in to Internet Studies has been pursued by a number of scholars. Studies of the Information Society and the Network Society have been pursued by scholars such as Manuel Castells, Mark Poster, and Frank Webster. Sherry Turkle and Robert Kraut are known for their socio-psychological contributions. Janet Abbate and Patrice Flichy are recognized for their socio-historical research; Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornwaite for their social network approaches; Ronald E. Rice for his information science contributions; David Lyon and Philip Agre for their privacy and surveillance writings; Lawrence Lessig, Andrew Chadwick, Jonathan Zittrain for their study of law and politics; and Robin Williams, Robin Mansell and Steve Woolgar for their contributions about innovation.\n\nAs Barry Wellman argues, internet studies may find its beginnings with the 1978 publication of \"The Network Nation\", and was largely dominated by computer scientists, presenting at venues like the annual CSCW conference. These were quickly joined by researchers in business fields and library and information science. By the late 1990s, more attention was being paid to systematic investigation of users and how they made use of the new technologies. During the 1990s, the rapid diffusion of internet access began to attract more attention from a number of social science and humanities disciplines, including the field of communication. Some of these investigations, like the Pew Internet & American Life project and the World Internet Project framed the research in terms of traditional social science approaches, with a focus less on the technology than on those who use them. But the focus remained at the aggregate level. In the UK, the ESRC Programme on Information and Communications Technologies (1986–1996) laid considerable ground work on how society and ICTs interact, bringing together important clusters of scholars from media and communications, society, innovation, law, policy and industry across leading UK universities.\n\nIn 1996, this interest was expressed in other ways as well. Georgetown University began offering a related master's program in that year, and at the University of Maryland, David Silver created the Resource Center for Cyberculture Studies on the web. Middlebury College developed Politics of Virtual Realities, one of the first undergraduate courses dedicated to exploring the political, legal and normative implications of the Internet for liberal democracy. By 2001, \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" noted that \"internet studies\" was emerging as a discipline in its own right, as suggested by the first undergraduate program in the area, offered at Brandeis University, and noted that \"perhaps the most telling sign of the field's momentum\" was the popularity of the annual conference created by the then nascent Association of Internet Researchers.\n\nFrom particularly sociological perspective, James Slevin (2000) develops a social theory of the Internet that is primarily informed by the line of thought grounded by the British sociologist Anthony Giddens., while Christian Fuchs (2008) is a social theory account that is primarily grounded in the works by critical theory scholars such as Herbert Marcuse, by the concept of social self-organization, and by neo-Marxist thinking.\n\nMore recent approaches to studying the internet have focused on situating technology use within particular social contexts, and understanding just how it is related to social and institutional change.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served as member of the House of Commons of Canada for Battlefords—Lloydminster from 1997 until his resignation in 2017. He served as Canada's Agriculture minister from 2007 through 2015 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\nRitz was born in Delisle, Saskatchewan and prior to his political career, he worked as a farmer at the family farm for over 20 years and owned a contracting business company.\n\nRitz was elected as the Reform Party candidate in the 1997 general election, and then re-elected with the Canadian Alliance in the 2000 election and the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2004 election. Ritz has been the vice-chair of the House of Commons Agriculture Committee since 2002. He was appointed Secretary of State for small business and tourism in the Harper government on January 4, 2007.\n\nOn August 14, 2007, Ritz was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food replacing Chuck Strahl.\n\nRitz made national news when, in response to the 2008 Canadian listeriosis outbreak he was quoted as saying, \"This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or should I say cold cuts.\" Then when told of a death in Prince Edward Island, Ritz said, \"Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) Wayne Easter.\" Ritz later apologized for his comments and Prime Minister Stephen Harper kept Ritz in Cabinet after the 2008 Canadian general election.\n\nIn September 2012, \"E. coli\" bacteria was found in meat from the XL Foods plant in Brooks, Alberta. This led to over 1800 products being recalled across Canada and the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 1.1 million kilograms of meat from XL Foods were recalled from American stores. This was also the largest beef recall in Canadian history, with meat being recalled in every province and territory in Canada and 41 American states.\n\nRitz announced on August 31, 2017 that he intended to resign from the House of Commons in the near future and leave politics to spend more time with family.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, Ritz caused controversy when he tweeted a link to a news story stating no industrialized nations were on pace to meet Paris Agreement carbon emission targets with the comment \"Has anyone told our climate Barbie! \" (referring to Environment Minister Catherine McKenna). Ritz deleted the original post within 20 minutes, afterward posted another message stating: \"I apologize for the use of Barbie, it is not reflective of the role the Minister plays\". Conservative leader Andrew Scheer condemned Ritz's comment later in the day and stated he would reach out to McKenna personally to \"assure the minister that this type of behavior has no place in the Conservative caucus\". The next day Ritz's office issued a statement confirming his resignation from the House of Commons effective October 2, 2017.\n\nRitz's successor, Rosemarie Falk, was elected in a by-election on December 11, 2017.\n\n"}

The fifteenth named storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Odette formed near the coast of Panama a few days after the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season, and ultimately made landfall on the Dominican Republic as a moderate tropical storm, before becoming extratropical on December 7, dissipating two days later.\n\nThe storm caused heavy damage throughout the Dominican Republic from unusually heavy rainfall in December. Preparation preceding Odette's landfall resulted in only eight deaths and 14 injuries. Total damage is unknown, though crop damage in the Dominican Republic totaled to over $8 million (2003 USD, $ million  USD).\n\nBy November 30, the last day of the Atlantic hurricane season, a stationary front extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. On December 1, a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of Panama, and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center. The low remained nearly stationary for the next several days, and it gradually became separated from the stationary front. Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence. Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2, though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift. On December 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140 miles (225 km) north of the surface center. Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200 UTC on December 4 while located about 345 miles (560 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica; initially, the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western Haiti.\nUpon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid-latitude trough, which caused a steady east-northeast motion. The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center, and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status; late on December 4, the National Hurricane Center named the storm \"Odette\". After being named, the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery. Additionally, about three–fourths of a mid-level eyewall developed. The storm was assessed with winds of 40–50 mph (65–85 km/h), though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data. The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly, and Hurricane Hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200 UTC on December 5. Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status. Early on December 6, a TRMM overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall, and at 0600 UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) while located about 245 miles (395 km/h) southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\n\nUpon reaching peak intensity, Odette had begun accelerating northeastward, which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow. The low-level center decelerated as it approached Hispaniola, though the convection continued quickly northeastward. Failing to maintain vertical organization, Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on Jaragua National Park, in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic, around 2300 UTC on December 6 with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country, and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). It accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front. The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on December 9; the frontal zone that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later.\n\nPrior to Odette's predicted arrival, the Dominican Republic government issued for the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, mostly from those living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000 people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior.\n\nA tropical storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/Haiti border on December 4, 56 hours prior to landfall. This was raised to a tropical storm warning on December 5 while 32 hours before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the Haitian coastline and Jamaica.\n\nWhile over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy rainfall, including prior to its formation. For several days, the storm caused rains in Panama, Costa Rica, and the east coast of Nicaragua. In Colombia, the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm) in Puerto Colombia. In Jamaica, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, flooding several roads in Saint Ann and Saint Mary Parishes. Odette caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the Dominican Republic.\n\nWinds from Tropical Storm Odette were relatively light across the Dominican Republic, with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in Santo Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting to a maximum of 9.07 inches (230 mm) in Isla Saona. Several other locations reported over 4 inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding, forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others.\n\nThe flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8 million (2003 USD). In addition, excess flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation.\n\nIn all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides. In addition, two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring Haiti experienced little from the storm.\n\nThough Odette passed 280 miles to the west of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, the storm caused moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Rainfall in Puerto Rico was heaviest in the southeast, where a peak of 8.73 in (221.74 mm) was recorded in Jajome Alto. The storm also caused up to 2.2 in (55.9 mm) of rainfall in Christiansted on Saint Croix.\n\nOdette's rainfall caused flooding throughout the island's rivers. The river flooding destroyed three bridges, resulting in $20,000 in damages (2003 USD). The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in Humacao. The rainfall also covered numerous roads, though overall damage was minimal throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nIn all, 65,000 people were affected by Tropical Storm Odette. The Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers to the impacted areas, primarily in the area of Monte Cristi. The organization provided food and hygiene kits to thousands of people, as well as mosquito nets. The Red Cross also gave a 5,000 liter water tank for the citizens in Monte Cristi, an area without clean water or sanitation.\n\nWhen Odette formed on December 4, it became the first tropical storm since the beginning of the modern tropical cyclone record to form in the Caribbean Sea in the month of December; a documented December Caribbean hurricane occurred in 1822. However, Tropical Storm Karen, which formed in November 1989, persisted until December while located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. In addition, Odette was the first Atlantic storm to form in the month of December since Hurricane Lili in 1984.\n\nThe 2003 season was the first season since 1954 to have a pre-season storm and a post-season storm, with Ana in April and Odette.\n\n"}

{"id": "1831642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831642", "title": "Ronnie Earle", "text": "Ronnie Earle\n\nRonald Dale Earle (February 23, 1942 – April 5, 2020) was an American politician and judge who was, from January 1977 to January 2009, the District Attorney for Travis County, Texas. He became nationally known for filing charges against House majority leader Tom DeLay in September 2005 for conspiring to violate Texas' election law and/or to launder money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an Eagle Scout - prosecuted \"himself\" for an election law violation after missing a campaign finance filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212. Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \"District Eternity\". \n\nEarle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \"ethics infrastructure\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the Austin Chronicle in 2008, \"It really informs everything I've tried to do – well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends – that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\"\n\nEarle was born in Fort Worth, Texas and raised on a cattle ranch in Birdville, Texas. He achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, earned money working as a lifeguard, played football, and was president of his high school student council.\n\nEarle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the University of Texas and law school at the University of Texas School of Law. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor John Connally. \n\nAfter graduating from law school, he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969-72. At the time, he was the youngest judge in Texas. \n\nEarle was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1972, serving until 1976. He was elected district attorney of Travis County in 1976 and served until 2008. He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure.\n\nEarle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, Elisabeth Ashlea Earle and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren.\n\nThe Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. \nEarle was elected as a Democrat in the city of Austin. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. \n\nDuring his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\nWhile his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were “engaging the community in its own protection.” Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. \n\nIn late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the primary election held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A runoff election was held between the top two finishers, and Rosemary Lehmberg – whom Earle had endorsed – won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.\n\nIn 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda.\n\nEarle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness.\n\nThrough the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted politicians, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, United States House Majority Leader Tom Delay, Texas State Representative Mike Martin, and Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox. \n\nDefendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats.\n\nIn 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. \n\nIn 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \"misapplying county property\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\n\nIn 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution.\n\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative Mike Martin, a Republican then of Longview, was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the \"Austin American Statesman\" that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a Satanic cult; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \n\nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to \"The Statesman\". Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old assault charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong nepotism laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a plea bargain with Earle by admitting to misdemeanor perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy qualified immunity from civil suits. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.\n\nIn 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution.\n\nIn 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine.\n\nIn 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General Jim Mattox of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and Clinton Manges, a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial.\n\nIn 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\nIn 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution.\n\nIn 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count.\n\nIn 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican then serving as Texas State Treasurer, for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, instructing the jury to return a \"not guilty\" verdict so the charge could not be brought against her again. \n\nIn 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\nIn 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Association was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service.\n\nIn 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000.\nFor over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \"fishing expedition\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a political action committee founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". \n\nOn September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that Texans for a Republican Majority, DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, laundered the money through the Republican National Committee, and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, Pat Priest, a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007.\n\nEarle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed. That grand jury returned a \"no bill\" due to insufficient evidence. The jury member questioned stated that Earle appeared visibly angry with the \"no bill\" decision.\n\nEarle eventually received an indictment against DeLay from a third Austin grand jury that had been seated for a few hours. This indictment was on charges of conspiracy to launder money. DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the \"\"proceeds of criminal activity\"\". DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader. \n\nIn a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with prosecutorial misconduct in the DeLay indictment. DeGuerin sought court permission to depose grand jurors.\n\nDeLay filed a motion for a change of venue from the Democrat stronghold of Travis County to Fort Bend County, where he resides. The motion was denied by Judge Priest and a trial date for October 2010 was set. On November 24, 2010, DeLay was convicted of money laundering. The conviction was overturned by the Republican-dominated Third Court of Appeals for the State of Texas in September 2013. The court found that \"\"there was no evidence that [the PAC] or RNSEC [the Republican National State Elections Committee] treated the corporate funds as anything but what they were, corporate funds with limited uses under campaign finance law.\"\" In its opinion, the court decided that \"\"...the evidence shows that the defendants were attempting to comply with the Election Code limitations on corporate contributions.\"\" The court not only overturned the verdict, but took the step of entering a full acquittal.\n\nIn 1996, Earle indicted 11-year-old LaCresha Murray for capital murder involving two-year-old Jayla Belton - the youngest homicide prosecution in Texas history. Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries—indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by malicious prosecution, defamation, libel and slander, and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the US Supreme Court refused to revive the lawsuit.\n\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"Yogurt Shop Murders\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and sentenced to death. Scott was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence. The case against Pierce remains open. On December 24, 2010, Pierce was shot dead by Austin police officers in an incident during which Pierce allegedly stabbed a police officer with the officer's knife.\n\nImmediately after Earle announced his retirement as District Attorney of Travis County in December 2007, he began being mentioned as a possible statewide candidate. In the spring of 2009, Earle's name began being mentioned specifically in context with a race for either Texas Attorney General or Texas Governor.\n\nEarle said he was considering a run for one of the two posts. On June 30, 2009, an Internet draft movement, DraftRonnie.com, was launched to urge Earle to run for Texas governor. The Draft Ronnie website and draft movement ended in September 2009, when Democrat Hank Gilbert entered the race for Texas Governor. On December 18, 2009, Earle filed the necessary paperwork to run for Lieutenant Governor of Texas but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Linda Chavez-Thompson, a labor union activist. She, in turn, was defeated in the general election by the incumbent Republican David Dewhurst in November 2010.\n\n"}

Girls were first admitted to Grade 12 in 1992 and were phased into the other grades beginning in the 1995–96 school year.\n\nUntil recently, LCC was one of the few remaining schools with a covered outdoor ice hockey rink. This has been replaced by a new athletics centre, as well as a new arena. In addition to hockey, LCC has been known for fielding strong teams in Canadian football, \nsoccer and basketball. Rugby was canceled in 2017 because it was deemed \"too dangerous\". LCC's traditional rival in sports and other matters is Selwyn House.\n\nThe annual tuition fees for attending LCC range from $18,695 to $23,845.

No incorporated areas were formed within the township but Akron and Cuyahoga Falls expanded into Northamption via annexation. In 1986, Northampton Township merged with Cuyahoga Falls, the first time a township and city merged in Ohio. When created it occupied survey Town 3, Range 11 in the Western Reserve and was about in area. Its first settler, Simeon Prior named the township for the Hampshire County, Massachusetts village of Northampton.\n\nNorthampton was originally bounded by Portage Township on the south, Bath Township on the west, Boston Township to the north and Stow Township to the east. At the time of its merger with Cuyahoga Falls it was bordered by Akron to the south, the city of Stow to the east and Cuyahoga Falls to the southeast.\n\nThe Ottawa and Mingo tribes hunted in Northampton before Europeans arrived. (Grant, 1891). The first white settler in Northampton was Simeon Prior, who moved there with his wife and ten children from Northampton, Massachusetts in 1802. Native Americans still lived in the township and remained there until 1812 when American forces began to assemble there for the War of 1812. Northampton provided a rendezvous point for militia during the war and the two (Grant, 1891) or three (Doyle, 1908) vessels of Oliver Hazard Perry's fleet were built in the township and floated down the Cuyahoga River to Lake Erie.\n\nIn 1986 Northampton merged with Cuyahoga Falls. Both Akron and Cuyahoga Falls had been annexing the southern part of the township. Also, a major portion of the township had been purchased by the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (now the Cuyahoga Valley National Park), reducing the tax base. The residents of Northampton chose to join with Cuyahoga Falls so that their future would be settled. The township became Ward 8 in Cuyahoga Falls and kept special zoning to preserve some of its rural nature.\n\nAnnexation of parts of Northampton by Akron had left an irregular border between the two communities, including several islands inside Akron. Akron and Cuyahoga Falls tried to work out a land swap to smooth out the borders. They came up with a plan but it was never approved. The two cities have a joint fire station, though, that covers part of both communities.\n\nNorthampton Township's land has been in the following counties: (Author unknown, 1999-2005)\n\n\nNorthampton was served by Route 8, which originally went up Akron-Cleveland Road (now State Road).

Laid down 15 January 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Union Plant, San Francisco, Calif., she was launched 10 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Elton W. Grenfell; and commissioned 23 April 1943, Commander Baron J. Mullaney in command.\n\nAfter shakedown and training off San Diego and escort duty in the Aleutians, \"Mullany\" joined the 7th Fleet in the southwest Pacific in December 1943. Her first action came 2 to 4 March 1944 when she protected minesweepers clearing the approaches to Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, prior to the amphibious landings on Los Negros, the island forming the northeastern side of the harbor. Attracting Japanese gunfire, \"Mullany\" silenced the Japanese harbor defenses with 5 inch fire, enabling the minesweepers to complete their vital mission. For the next 2 days \"Mullany\" fired to support American troops fighting ashore.\n\nScreening 7th Fleet flagship during the invasion of Leyte Gulf, \"Mullany\" fired to help drive off nine separate enemy air attacks from 20 to 29 October, then sailed for overhaul at San Francisco. After training near Hawaii in January 1945, she joined Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Iwo Jima, to which she escorted troop transports. After firing in the preinvasion bombardment, she supported troops landing and fighting ashore, hitting caves and machinegun nests on Mount Suribachi 19 February.\n\nAn antisubmarine picket guarding the Okinawa invasion force 6 April 1945, \"Mullany\" opened fire on a Japanese kamikaze plane at 17:45. A few seconds later the fighter was smoking from numerous hits, but somehow managed to stay together. Skipper Comdr. Albert O. Momm ordered the ship to turn out of the kamikaze's path, but couldn't get out of the way in time. The plane slammed into the after deckhouse. Before damage control parties could remove all the wounded from the twisted metal and exploding ammunition, the ship's depth charges exploded. In the next 20 minutes three more enemy aircraft attacked stricken \"Mullany\". Her forward gunners downed two and drove the other away.\n\nAn hour later, Momm received a report that the bulkhead of one of the aft magazines was hot and an explosion was apparently imminent. Many of the ship's officers had seen the disastrous consequences of a magazine explosion, and at 18:29 Momm gave the order to abandon ship. stood by to take on survivors while her rescue and assistance team continued to spray water on \"Mullany\". The rescued 70 members of the Mullany crew from the water. The \"Execute\" then came alongside and helped fight the fires. In the next hours came alongside the burning ship and extinguished the flames. Since the expected explosion had been prevented by punctured fuel and water tanks flooding the compartments above the hot magazine, Commander Momm took a skeleton crew back aboard at 23:00. After the fires were extinguished the \"Execute\" attempted a tow using her sweep gear. At first the \"Mullany\" was in tow at low speed. With an increase in speed the sweep cable snapped and the tow attempt was discontinued. The \"Mullany\" crew then succeeded in lighting off one boiler, and \"Mullany\" limped off on one shaft for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, arriving 29 May. Courage and determination had saved their ship, but 21 of her crew were killed, nine missing, and 36 wounded.\n\nCompletely repaired, \"Mullany\" put to sea 25 September for the Panama Canal and duty with the Atlantic Fleet, until decommissioning 14 February 1946 to join the Reserve Fleet at Charleston, South Carolina\n\nRecommissioned 8 March 1951, \"Mullany\" rejoined the Atlantic Fleet and by January 1954 had made three deployments to the Mediterranean to join in the peace-keeping missions of the 6th Fleet.\n\nWith her squadron, Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon 18), \"Mullany\" departed Newport, R.I. 1 December 1954 for San Diego, where the squadron was redesignated DesRon 21 for service in the Pacific Fleet. In the next 10 years, \"Mullany\" served eight times in the western Pacific with the 7th Fleet, joining in patrol and training operations essential to the protection of freedom in Asia.\n\nVeteran \"Mullany\" returned to combat during her ninth cruise to the coast of Asia, screening carrier in flight operations off Vietnam in 1965, as well as serving as harbor defense ship at Da Nang. On 6 July 1965, \"Mullany's\" five-inch guns were fired in anger for the first time since Okinawa. This time it was in support of the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment landing at Qui Nhon. During that cruise Mullany encountered the first known Soviet spy ship off the coast of Vietnam. The \"Ivan\",as Mullany's crew dubbed her, was disguised as a fishing vessel. Mullany \"shadowed\" the Ivan for several days, collecting vital intelligence before turning over the shadowing duty to a fleet tug. The following year she returned to the coast of Vietnam to seek out and destroy craft moving enemy supplies. From 20 to 30 November 1966, she destroyed 28 enemy watercraft and damaged 26 others with her 5 inch guns. She screened until sailing for San Diego in March 1967. Following an overhaul at Long Beach, \"Mullany\" spent the remainder of the year conducting refresher training and local operations off the coast of California.\n\nIn February 1968, she once again deployed to the Western Pacific. On 24 April 1968 the positions of the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines at Wunder Beach were hit by 11-15 rounds of fire from the ship killing two Marines. On 9 July 1968, \"Mullany\" left Vietnamese waters for the last time. During 137 days at sea, she had steamed 46,468 miles, nearly twice around the earth. Over a career that spanned 25 years, she would have circumnavigated the globe more than 40 times. After a visit to Auckland, New Zealand, she returned to San Diego in September.\n\nBased in Long Beach, \"Mullany\" spent the next two years steaming up and down the West Coast as a reserve training ship.\nBy 1971, \"Mullany\" was the oldest destroyer on active service. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 6 October 1971, and sold to the Republic of China for $150,000, plus $3,000, \"administrative charges.\"\n\n\"Mullany\" received seven battle stars for World War II service.\n\nTransferred to the Republic of China Navy 6 October 1971, the ship was renamed Chin-yang（慶陽）.\nOn April 2, 1975, at 10:10 a.m. DDG-909 successfully launched the first Surface-to-Air missile in ROC Navy history, and that marks the missile era for the ROC Navy. DDG-909 Chin-Yang was in service of ROC Navy for 26 years and through 20 Commanding Officers. The mission was patrolling the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters to convoy offshore-islands-support-and-supply, task flotilla and various missions.

{"id": "1831666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831666", "title": "Clusium", "text": "Clusium\n\nClusium (, \"Klýsion\", or , \"Kloúsion\"; Umbrian:\"Camars\") was an ancient city in Italy, one of several found at the site. The current municipality of Chiusi (Tuscany) partly overlaps this Roman walled city. The Roman city remodeled an earlier Etruscan city, Clevsin, found in the territory of a prehistoric culture, possibly also Etruscan or proto-Etruscan. The site is located in northern central Italy on the west side of the Apennines.\n\nChiusi is situated on a hill above the valley of the Clanis river near lake Clusium, both of which features had those names in antiquity. The Clanis is part of the Tiber drainage system and was navigable by boat from there. Rome was also accessed by the via Cassia, which was built over an Etruscan road.\n\nBy the time it appears in Livy's \"History\", it is already a major Etruscan city being petitioned for assistance against the republican partisans of ancient Rome. About its life prior to that time, Livy only makes a brief statement that it was once called \"Camars\".\n\nDifferent theories exist of the city's origin. Villanovan pottery has been found at Chiusi. One common type is a cinerary urn dating to the 8th century BC. These urns are in the shape of wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs, presumably the homes of the deceased. This style of architecture is so different from classical Etruscan that many Etruscologists have denied a continuity. On the other hand, it is clear that the people of the region received a strong impetus from Greek colonies such as Cumae and from Greek immigration.\n\nThe minority theory is currently the Proto-Italic. In this theory, Etruscans from the coast or from the Aegean resettled and renamed an Umbrian city called Camars, which the exponents believe means \"marshland\" in Italic. On enclosing the city with a wall they changed the name to \"enclosure\", using an Etruscanized form, Clevsin, of the perfect passive participle, \"clusus\", of Latin \"cludere\", \"to close\".\n\nClevsin and Camars are more comfortable in their Etruscan milieu as Etruscan words. The limited known Etruscan vocabulary includes \"camthi\", the name of a magistracy, which might be segmented \"cam-thi\", where –thi is a known locative ending. Ar, -arasi, -aras are plural endings of different cases. A \"cleva\" is an offering. S and -isi are genitive and dative endings. A place of magistracies or offerings is entirely harmonious with Etruscan culture and the uses of a regional capital city. The final resolution of the question waits for more evidence.\n\nIt is believed that Clusium joined the Etruscan League of twelve cities in the 600s BC.\n\nThe site of ancient Clusium was reoccupied in Roman and later times, obscuring and obliterating much of the Etruscan layers. For example, the ancient sources describe the tomb of Lars Porsena at Clusium as well as the sacking and levelling of the city by Sulla. Much of what remains are its tombs and its underground passages, some of which might have been associated with the monument to Porsena.\n\nLars Porsena was king of Clusium in 508 BC. Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, formerly king of Rome, had been expelled along with his family from Rome in 509 BC. He had sought to regain the throne, firstly by the Tarquinian conspiracy and secondly by force of arms. Both attempts had been unsuccessful, the conspiracy having been discovered, and Tarquin's army having been defeated at the Battle of Silva Arsia.\n\nTarquin convinced Lars Porsena to lead his army against Rome. The war between Clusium and Rome followed, during which Porsena besieged Rome. The siege and the war ended with a peace treaty, by which Porsena received hostages from Rome and returned to Veii lands that had previously been taken by Rome. In 507 BC Rome's hostages and lands were restored, and peace between Rome and Porsena was cemented. Tarquinius was not restored to the Roman throne.\n\nIn 508 BC, after the siege of Rome, Porsena split his forces and sent part of the Clusian army with his son Aruns to besiege the Latin city of Aricia. The Clusians besieged Aricia; however the Aricians sent for assistance from the Latin League and from Cumae, and the Clusian army was defeated in battle\n\nPliny the Elder wrote that a magnificent tomb was built for Porsena; a large mausoleum surrounded by cascades of pyramids over a labyrinth of underground chambers in which an intruder could get lost. Pliny never saw this tomb, so his description was based on a report from Varro and perhaps a conflated comparison to the Minoan labyrinths he describes before this tomb. Large-size tumuli of the late archaic period were built at Chiusi, and modern scholars have tried to associate these (especially Poggio Gaiella) with the legendary tomb of Porsena.\n\nIn 2004 Professor of Urban Restoration Giuseppe Centauro suggested that the traditional location of Clusium at Chiusi is wrong and that it is near Florence. As of 2008 he was trying to raise money and get permission to excavate.\n\nIn the early 4th century BC (391 BC according to Varronian chronology) it was besieged by Gauls, and the Clusines called upon Rome to intermediate. However, in the following negotiations, one of the Roman delegates, of the gens Fabia, killed a Gallic leader. When the Romans refused to hand over the Fabii and in fact appointed two members of the family as consuls for the next year, the enraged Gauls broke up their siege and under the leadership of Brennus they marched onto and subsequently sacked Rome.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

The language extends classical process algebras such as Milner's CCS and Hoare's CSP by introducing probabilistic branching and timing of transitions.\n\nRates are drawn from the exponential distribution and PEPA models are finite-state and so give rise to a stochastic process, specifically a continuous-time Markov process (CTMC). Thus the language can be used to study quantitative properties of models of computer and communication systems such as throughput, utilisation and response time as well as qualitative properties such as freedom from deadlock. The language is formally defined using a structured operational semantics in the style invented by Gordon Plotkin.\n\nAs with most process algebras, PEPA is a parsimonious language. It has only four combinators, \"prefix\", \"choice\", \"co-operation\" and \"hiding\". Prefix is the basic building block of a sequential component: the process (\"a\", \"r\").\"P\" performs activity \"a\" at rate \"r\" before evolving to behave as component \"P\". Choice sets up a competition between two possible alternatives: in the process (\"a\", \"r\").\"P\" + (\"b\", \"s\").\"Q\" either \"a\" wins the race (and the process subsequently behaves as \"P\") or \"b\" wins the race (and the process subsequently behaves as \"Q\").\n\nThe co-operation operator requires the two \"co-operands\" to join for those activities which are specified in the co-operation set: in the process \"P\" < \"a\", \"b\"> \"Q\" the processes \"P\" and \"Q\" must co-operate on activities \"a\" and \"b\", but any other activities may be performed independently. The reversed compound agent theorem gives a set of sufficient conditions for a co-operation to have a product form stationary distribution.\n\nFinally, the process \"P\"/{\"a\"} hides the activity \"a\" from view (and prevents other processes from joining with it).\n\nGiven a set of action names, the set of PEPA processes is defined by the following BNF grammar:\n\nThe parts of the syntax are, in the order given above\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of 32, a personal connection helped secure Blanshard the post of colonial governor of Vancouver Island. Although the commission was dated in July, 1849, Blanshard did not arrive in the colony's capital of Fort Victoria until March of the following year.\n\nBlanshard's short tenure proved unhappy from the start, largely because of the enormous power and influence wielded by the Hudson's Bay Company and its autocratic Chief Factor, James Douglas. Indeed, prior to Blanshard's appointment, there had been serious consideration given by the colonial office to appointing Douglas governor, but concerns over conflict of interest prevented it.\n\nBlanshard arrived to a colony in which the land had been given as a ten-year lease to the Hudson's Bay Company, with Douglas given a mandate to attract settlement. Almost the entire non-First Nations population were Company employees, answerable to Douglas, and Blanshard was prevented from setting up a colonial assembly by the fact that so few of them met the qualifications of electors, i.e., land ownership. Inevitable jurisdictional conflicts arose between Douglas and Blanshard, and the colonial office, too, took Blanshard to task for indiscriminate retributions taken against the First Nations population near present-day Port Hardy. The absence of any real power, combined with health concerns and the enormous cost of living drove Blanshard to resign; he abandoned the colony in September, 1851 after just one and a half years there.\n\nBlanshard evidently did not pursue further colonial service. He married and inherited his family's estates in Essex and Hampshire. He died in London at the age of 76.\n\n\n\n"}

He left when I was six.\" He described his mother Kathy as a \"saint\".\n\nAfter attending Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute, Hacking started performing while a student at Scarborough College (a campus of the University of Toronto), where he graduated as an English major. \nHis career as a musician began when a representative from the student council, who had heard him play, asked him to perform at a concert. \"I said, 'You're crazy, are you out of your mind.' And he said '50 bucks, six songs...' You got me. I got up and nobody threw anything. In fact, several women who wouldn't normally speak to me came up after the gig and were cluttering about how they liked the music. And I said, 'Wow, this is good.'\"\n\nHe then accepted an invitation to play the pub two weeks later, which he did with a lead guitar accompanist. \"By the end of the night you couldn't hear yourself playing, it was so loud. And the table in front of the stage, they had been playing euchre all night and screaming and yelling, and they all got up in unison and mooned the stage. I said, 'OK, so that's how it is'.\"\n\nHacking would eventually become a regular at various establishments in Toronto. The recordings of early performances in 1976 and 1977 became his first solo album, \"Norm Hacking Live\" (1977).\n\nCritically acclaimed albums \"Cut Roses\" (1980) and \"Stubborn Ghost\" (1988) followed, and led to many festival and concert appearances. A video of the song \"Sammy\", from the album \"Cut Roses\", aired on The Nashville Network. Upon becoming the single caregiving parent to his young son Ben, however, he cut back on touring.\n\nIn 1996, with his son now a teen, Hacking released a greatest hits album with four new songs, \"Skysongs... A Writer's Collection\", and returned to more active performing. In 1996, and again in 1997, he was artistic director of the Caledon Folk Festival.\n\nA group of Canadian and American songwriters recorded 18 of his songs for a tribute album, \"One Voice: A Tribute to Norm Hacking, Vol. 1\", in 2001. Wayne Marshall of Three Flamingos Music initiated the project. The performers on the album included Michael Peter Smith, Alan Rhody, Mikel Miller, Roger James, Nancy White, Chris Whiteley, Ron Nigrini, Jory Nash, Slowpoke, Jason Fowler and many others.\n\nHacking released \"I Am The Night\", a collection of 33 original spoken word selections – poetry, prose, and lyrics – in 2005. Richard Christy, of the Kingston \"Whig-Standard\", described each piece as \"a very real slice of life. They are easy to relate to yet are neither simple nor boring... Hacking, like John Steinbeck, understands the depths of very simple situations and the simplicity of very complicated events.\"\n\nOn October 4, 2006, Hacking's mother Kathy died, with Norm at her side. He had spent most of his time since July with her at Scarborough Grace Hospital. Her death came as a profound emotional blow to Hacking, whose health deteriorated noticeably in the last few months, friends said.\n\nAlong with performing, in 1992 Hacking started writing a column, \"Racetrack Hack\", for \"Taxinews\", a monthly publication for and about Toronto's taxi industry.\n\nA chronic leg infection limited his mobility in his final years. Norm Hacking died in his sleep from an apparent heart attack in his home on the night of November 25, 2007. \"What I admired most about Norm and his songs are their realness, their honesty,\" said Chris Whiteley. \"He made no excuses and his songs were those of a hopeless romantic. His best work was filled with a sense of wonder, and I hope those songs will be around for a long time for others to sing.\"\n\n\n"}

The TARDIS lands on a rocky beach and the Doctor establishes the century from a discarded Viking helmet and heads off to the village. Steven and Vicki explore the cliffs above, witnessed by a Monk. The TARDIS is soon after spotted by a Saxon villager, Eldred, who runs to tell the headman of his village, Wulnoth. The Doctor encounters Edith, Wulnoth’s wife, and convinces her he is a harmless traveller, while probing for more information. He finds out it is 1066, since Harold Godwinson is on the throne and has not yet faced Harald Hardrada at Stamford Bridge let alone William the Conqueror in the Battle of Hastings. At a nearby monastery, monks are heard chanting. The Doctor finds a gramophone playing the chant, and heads off towards a nearby monastery, where a mysterious Monk traps the Doctor in a cell.\n\nSteven and Vicki encounter Eldred and notice he has a wristwatch, which the Monk had dropped earlier. They spend the night in a clearing, and the next morning are ambushed by the Saxons and taken to the village council. They convince Wulnoth they are but travellers, and are given provisions to travel on. Vicki is heartened to hear from Edith that the Doctor passed by her hut on his way to the monastery. Steven and Vicki visit the monastery, where the Monk tries to dissuade them from entering but gives himself away by describing the Doctor too accurately. Steven and Vicki decide he must be a prisoner inside. They break in after dark.\n\nThe Monk sees a Viking ship on the horizon. The Vikings land, and two small groups are sent to search the area. A Viking finds and attacks Edith, and the Saxons go hunting for the invaders. The Vikings are drunk; the giant that attacked Edith is cut down. His companions, Sven and Ulf, flee. Eldred has been badly wounded, and Wulnoth takes him to the monastery for help.\n\nWhile the Monk is occupied with the Saxons, Steven and Vicki find the gramophone. They then leave the monastery via a secret passage. Steven and Vicki have found that the TARDIS has been submerged beneath the incoming tide. They resolve to return to the monastery to look for the Doctor.\n\nThe Doctor has escaped by the same passage himself, and returns to the Saxon village. He soon hears of the Viking scouting party, and decides to head back to the monastery to track down Steven and Vicki. The Doctor gains the upper hand when the Monk answers the door and believes he is being held at gunpoint. The Monk is being questioned by the Doctor when they are overpowered by Sven and Ulf. In the ensuing confrontation the Monk slips away, leaving the Doctor the Vikings' prisoner. The Doctor knocks out Sven, and elsewhere the Monk does the same to Ulf.\n\nThe Monk uses his freedom to persuade the villagers to light beacon fires on the cliff tops, telling them that he is expecting materials by sea, when in fact he wishes to lure the Viking fleet to land. Wulnoth agrees to light the fires, but does not do so as he realises the danger.\n\nSteven and Vicki return to the monastery via the secret passage and investigate the crypt, where a heavy power cable emanates from a sarcophagus. Looking inside, they discover that it is the Monk's TARDIS, and that he must have come from the same place as the Doctor. The Monk has returned to the monastery and is once more under the Doctor’s control. He reveals his plan is to lure the Vikings to the coast and destroy the fleet. This would shore up King Harold to such an extent he would not then lose the Battle of Hastings. The Monk is a Time Meddler. The Doctor denounces the Monk for seeking to alter history, and forces him to reveal his TARDIS, where they find Steven and Vicki. Rejoined, the time travellers piece together the Monk’s plot, which the Monk insists is intended to stabilise England and benefit Western civilisation.\n\nUlf and Sven have formed an alliance with the Monk, and have tied up the Doctor’s party while the three of them take the neutron bomb shells down to the cannon on the beach. The scheme is foiled, however, when Wulnoth and the Saxons arrive and engage the fleeing Vikings in a nearby clearing, killing Sven and Ulf in battle.\n\nThe Monk hides while the fighting rages, little knowing that the Doctor and his friends have been freed by Edith and are tampering with his TARDIS. With his scheme in ruins, the Monk decides to leave and returns to his TARDIS, though the Doctor left a note assuring the Monk his meddling days are ended. When the Monk looks inside he realises the Doctor has taken the dimensional control and that the interior of his ship has shrunk beyond use, leaving him stranded in 1066. The tide having gone out, the Doctor and his friends are free to leave.\n\nThe working title for this story was \"The Monk\". \"The Time Meddler\" is the first example of what is known in \"Doctor Who\" as the 'pseudo-historical' or 'ahistorical' story, which is one that uses the past as a setting for a science fiction story, as opposed to the pure historical stories, which are set in the past but have no science-fictional elements attached to them besides the presence of the regular characters and the TARDIS.\n\nDuring production of this story, new producer John Wiles began taking over production duties. William Hartnell, displeased at the number of changes undergoing the production, play-acted throwing a temper tantrum during the rehearsal of this story.\n\nFootage of the Viking ship was taken from a BBC Newsreel item about a Viking recreation on the south coast of England. In the remastered DVD version this footage is restored from the original film, and the complete item appears on the DVD extras.\n\nEpisodes 1, 3, and 4 were reported missing from the BBC Film and Videotape Library following an audit in 1978 (see \"Doctor Who\" missing episodes). Edited telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from Nigeria in 1985, and complete copies of episodes 1 and 3 were returned in 1992. 12 seconds from episode 4, depicting an act of violence, remains missing from the otherwise complete prints of all four episodes, as it was removed by censors. The 2008 Region 2 DVD release includes as an extra, called The Missing 12 Seconds, the audio for this missing sequence with original script excerpts and explanatory text – it appears that the two Vikings were seen on screen to be run through by the sword-wielding Saxons via the use of dummies.\n\nWilliam Hartnell does not appear in episode 2 as he was on holiday. A pre-taped recording of his voice is played when the Doctor is locked in a cell.\n\nAlethea Charlton also appeared in \"An Unearthly Child\" (1963) as the cavewoman, Hur.\n\nThe serial was repeated on BBC2 in January 1992 on consecutive Fridays – 03/01/92 to 24/01/92 at 7.20pm/6.50pm, as part of a season of stories to represent each of the (then) seven Doctors' adventures. The repeat achieved ratings of 2.37, 2.79, 2.58 and 2.63 million viewers respectively.\n\nReviewing the serial in 2009, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" described it as \"an utter delight\", praising Butterworth and the direction. \"The A.V. Club\" reviewer Christopher Bahn was positive towards the concept of the Monk and the introduction of Steven. He also noted that it \"keeps things moving despite its relatively simple plotline, a testament both to Dennis Spooner's script and Douglas Camfield's direction\". Johnathan Wilkins, writing for \"Dreamwatch\", described \"The Time Meddler\" as \"an often forgotten gem\" with good performances all around. However, he did note that the \"weakest element\" was perhaps the \"stereotypical\" local villagers. IGN's Arnold T Blumburg gave the serial a score of 7 out of 10, highlighting the chemistry between Hartnell and Butterworth, the competency of Vicki and Steven, and the visual atmosphere. Despite this, he noted that there were a few clichés in the plotting and, unlike Bahn, felt that it was \"definitely a slow-paced story\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek gave \"The Time Meddler\" a rating of three out of five, feeling that it \"really hits its stride\" with the sparring between the Doctor and the Monk, but ultimately the story was not enough to cover four episodes.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Nigel Robinson, was published by Target Books in October 1987.\n\nThe story was released on VHS in November 2002. On 4 February 2008, it was released on DVD. The quality of the surviving prints of the later episodes was deemed low enough that the typical VidFIRE process was not applied to the story. The DVD was dedicated to the late Verity Lambert.\n\n"}

It was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 11 September to 2 October 1965. Only the third episode (\"Air Lock\") is held in the BBC archives, and the other three remain missing.\n\nThe First Doctor, Vicki and Steven Taylor arrive on an eerily silent planet and encounter curious short and squat non-humanoid robots which resemble three domes stacked on top of each other, and Vicki decides to call the blind, beeping metre-tall machines \"Chumbleys\" because of what she calls the \"chumbley\" way they move.\n\nThe TARDIS crew are still trying to decide whether the Chumbleys are hostile or not when one is disabled by an all-female party of cloned blonde Drahvin warriors from the planet Drahva in Galaxy 4. It is revealed that the unknown planet they are on is also in Galaxy 4 but is not given a name. The Drahvins are dominated by their cruel leader, Maaga, who treats her simple-minded subordinates with bullying contempt. The Drahvins are at war with the reptilian Rills, the masters of the Chumbleys, and both races have crashed spaceships on this planet.\n\nThe planet will be destroyed in 14 planetary cycles and, with the Drahvin ship irreparable, Maaga and her warriors are keen to capture the Rill ship, which they believe has been made functional again. Maaga paints a picture of the Drahvins as the attacked species in the scenario, but the Doctor has witnessed some of the Drahvin aggression and is clearly not convinced. He also reworks the probability on the planet's destruction and calculates it will break up in just two days' time. The Doctor tries to keep this new finding from the Drahvins, but Maaga reveals her true colours and forces the truth from him at the point of a gun.\n\nWith Steven held as hostage to ensure their co-operation, the Doctor and Vicki are sent by the Drahvins to try to seize control of the Rill ship. The Doctor works out that the ammonia-breathing Rills are a very advanced species: when he meets one he is impressed, not least by their species' use of telepathy. The huge and impressive, horned warthog-like Rill explains that they have offered to take the Drahvins away with them but Maaga has refused, preferring to maintain a state of war. The Doctor tells the Rills of the true life remaining in the planet and promises to help them escape, since the solar energy converters on the Rill craft have not gathered enough power to effect a lift-off.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Drahvin ship to find Steven unconscious after Maaga has tried to kill him by leaving him in a depressurised airlock. They all return to the Rill vessel, where the Doctor successfully develops a power converter linked to the TARDIS, which charges the Rill craft. Maaga leads the Drahvins in a final assault but the Chumbleys defend their ship long enough for it to power up and leave the planet. One Chumbley left behind to aid the time travellers helps them get back to the TARDIS. Once the ship leaves, the planet explodes, with the Drahvins perishing on the dying world.\n\nThe story ends with a lead in to \"Mission to the Unknown\" with Vicki looking at a planet, and wondering what is happening on it. The action then switches to the planet, where Jeff Garvey in a jungle is repeating \"I must kill\".\n\nThe working title for this story was \"The Chumbleys\". Different resources alternatively spell out the numeral in the title: \"Galaxy Four\".\n\nThe BBC no longer holds the complete serial in its archives, although on 11 December 2011 it was announced that episode 3, \"Air Lock\", had been discovered earlier that year among material bought by former ITV engineer Terry Burnett; however, due to a break in the film, the last 27 seconds of action and the closing credits are all missing from the print. Additionally, almost six minutes' worth of footage from episode 1, \"Four Hundred Dawns\", is held in the archive thanks to a 1977 documentary entitled \"Whose Doctor Who\"—although only 30 seconds were eventually used, the footage that was discarded was kept by Jan Vincent-Rudzki, then-president of the \"Doctor Who\" Appreciation Society, who acted as a technical advisor on the documentary programme, and who returned the footage he had kept to the BBC in the 1990s.\n\n Episode is missing\n\nThe ratings for this story ranged from 9 million viewers for episode one to a peak of 11.3 million viewers for episode three.\n\n\"Radio Times\" reviewer Patrick Mulkern thought the story was \"By no means a classic\" but did have \"sparks of originality\". Mulkern considered it to be \"an entertaining if pedestrian beginning\" to season 3.\n\nIan Levine claimed that the \"Doctor Who\" Appreciation Society obtained legal permission to privately screen this serial at a convention in 1978, only to find that the BBC had junked the episodes about three weeks prior. Later research subsequently showed this to be mistaken, as the DWAS never held any agreement to show the serial, and BBC Enterprises appear to have junked at least one of the episodes by the end of 1976.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by William Emms, was published by Target Books in November 1985, entitled \"Galaxy Four\".\n\nThe script of this serial was published by Titan Books in July 1994, edited by John McElroy, here entitled \"Galaxy 4\". At the time of printing, the only audio recording known to exist was a poor-quality copy of the second episode \"Trap of Steel\" which had several parts completely inaudible.\n\nThe existing clip from \"Four Hundred Dawns\" was featured in the documentary \"The Missing Years\", which was released on VHS in 1998 and on DVD (as part of the \"Lost in Time\" box set) in 2004.\n\nThe newly rediscovered third episode, \"Air Lock\", was released on 11 March, 2013, as an extra on the \"Special Edition\" DVD release of \"The Aztecs\"; It was included alongside an abridged 40 minute reconstruction of the three missing episodes which used surviving clips, audio and photographs. This reconstruction had been originally prepared for the DVD of \"The Time Meddler\".\n\nThe soundtrack for the serial is intact and was released commercially in 2002, with linking narration provided by Peter Purves.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1831728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831728", "title": "Robert Johnson (English composer)", "text": "Robert Johnson (English composer)\n\nRobert Johnson (c. 1583 – 1633) was an English composer and lutenist of the late Tudor and early Jacobean eras. He is sometimes called \"Robert Johnson II\" to distinguish him from an earlier Scottish composer. Johnson worked with William Shakespeare providing music for some of his later plays.\n\nRobert Johnson was the son of John Johnson, who was lutenist to Elizabeth I. In 1594 Robert's father died, and in 1596 he joined the household of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon as an apprentice. Robert is assumed to have been around 13 at the time, as this was a typical age to begin an apprenticeship, but his date of birth is not known. Carey and his wife Elizabeth Spencer were patrons of the lutenist and composer John Dowland, who dedicated various compositions to them. The family had a London house (in Blackfriars) and a country home Hunsdon House (in Hunsdon, Hertfordshire), which partially survives.\n\nJohnson joined the Carey household at an interesting time in their patronage of the arts. In 1597 Dowland dedicated his \"First book of songs and ayres\" to George Carey.\nAs well as supporting musicians, Carey was patron of a theatre company to which William Shakespeare belonged. In 1596/7 the company was briefly known as \"Baron Hunsdon's Men\", but is better known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men (the name they used after Carey became Lord Chamberlain in 1597), or their subsequent name, the King's Men. It is not known whether Johnson worked with this theatre company on any of their productions in the 1590s, such as \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". However, he certainly provided music for the King's Men in a later stage of his career.\n\nJohnson's patron George Carey died in 1603. The following year Johnson found work at the court of James I where a number of lutenists were employed. Lutes came in various sizes and Johnson may have specialised in the bass lute when playing in consort music.\n\nJohnson was lutenist to Prince Henry (until the prince's death in 1612). He composed music for the masques and entertainments which were popular at court in the Jacobean era. For example, he wrote music for \"Oberon, the Faery Prince\" in which Prince Henry took the title role. He also served at the court of Charles I, remaining on the royal payroll until 1633, the year of his death.\n\nJohnson's surviving compositions for the King's Men theatrical company have been dated to 1610–1617.\nDuring these years the King's Men were producing plays by Shakespeare and other playwrights such as Ben Jonson, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. Johnson's main claim to fame is that he composed the original settings for some of Shakespeare's lyrics, the best-known being probably those from \"The Tempest\": \"Where the Bee Sucks\" and \"Full Fathom Five\". He is the only composer known to have composed the original settings of Shakespeare's lyrics. While other contemporary settings of Shakespeare's lyrics exist, for example those by Thomas Morley, they have not been proved to be connected to a stage performance.\n\nFrom 1608 the King's Men company was using the Blackfriars Theatre as its winter base, and this may have influenced the songs and instrumental music required from Johnson. The Blackfriars Theatre, which had previously been used by a company of acting/singing children, offered increased scope for incidental music compared to the Globe Theatre. One difference between the theatres was that Blackfriars was an indoors venue, lit by candles which needed to be replaced between acts. It featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston's \"The Malcontent\" (published 1604) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time. Shakespeare´s \"The Tempest\" (circa 1610), in which the stage directions call for music and sound effects, is an example of a play which may have been written for performance at Blackfriars. However, the company continued to perform at The Globe, and other venues such as the court, where Johnson's theatre music would presumably also have been heard.\n\nThere is a partial discography on the HOASM website. Other recordings include a recital of Robert's lute music by Nigel North on Naxos, and a lute recital by Lynda Sayce of music by Robert and his father on Dervorguilla Records.\n\nThe best-selling recording is that of Sting on the 2006 album \"Songs from the Labyrinth\".\n\n\nThe following list mainly follows the order of \"Shakespeare's lutenist\" (a recording of the singers Emma Kirkby and David Thomas with the lutenist Anthony Rooley):\n\n\n\n"}

It was seen by many as a rerun of the earlier contest in April. The by-election was caused by the death of the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.\n\nThe constituency, based on the districts of Fermanagh and Dungannon, was created in 1950 and had seen a series of closely fought elections between unionist and Irish nationalist candidates, with several elections being won due to the absence of competing candidates on one side or the other.\n\nThe April by-election was a straight contest between Sands, standing as \"Anti-H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner\" and the former Ulster Unionist Party MP and leader Harry West, with no other candidates standing. Sands won with a majority of 1446 (with 3280 spoilt ballot papers).\n\nFollowing Sands' victory and death shortly afterwards, the British government passed the Representation of the People Act barring prisoners from standing for Parliament. As a result, another prisoner on hunger strike could not be nominated. Instead Owen Carron, who had served as Sands' agent in the earlier election, was nominated as an \"Anti-H-Block Proxy Political Prisoner\".\n\nThe Ulster Unionists nominated a new candidate, Ken Maginnis, who had recently retired from the Ulster Defence Regiment with the rank of Major, who was on the liberal wing of the party. Maginnis was unusual amongst Ulster Unionist candidates as he had never been a member of the Orange Order.\n\nThe new by-election also saw four additional candidates stand. Seamus Close stood for the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland even though this was traditionally one of their weakest areas. Tom Moore stood for the Workers Party Republican Clubs who were descended from the Official IRA.

It has a population of about 74,100 and it's the center of the Al-Qa'im District.\n\nThe river water at Al-Qa'im carries less salt and mineral, so that it takes significantly less water to sustainably produce crops here than farther downstream, where more gallons of water must be used to avoid salinity.\n\nThe Al-Qa'im border crossing connects Al-Qaim to close city Abu Kamal in Syria.\n\nIn the early 20th century, there was a \"khan\" (caravanserai) and police station in Al-Qa'im, but no village. The \"khan\" was built in 1907 and was the residence of a local administrator. The surrounding area was inhabited by Arabs from the Karablah and Jara'if tribes.\n\nAl-Qa'im was reportedly the site of Iraq's refined uranium ore production from 1984 through 1990. The officially named \"Chemical Fertilizer Complex\" was originally built by Belgian contractors in January 1976, and by 1982 it was processing Phosphate from the nearby Akashat mine. That year, Iraq decided to build a uranium extraction facility on the same site, and hired Belgian contractors Mebshem to build the structure, completed in 1984. Unused uranium from Al-Qa'im was stored in nearby Tuwaitha.\n\nThe production facility was completely destroyed during a 1991 US bombing campaign during the Gulf War.\n\nIn the Iraq War, Qa'im was a center of attacks by the Iraqi insurgency against US military personnel at the nearby military base of Camp Gannon. The U.S. military regarded Qa'im as the entry point for foreign fighters into Iraq and viewed it as a strategically important point.\n\nIt was reported by \"Newsweek\" in 2003 that American soldiers stationed in the border city entered Syria. During the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment's control, a photojournalist embedded to the unit documented the city's events, and his photos were used in \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\". A more candid article titled \"Iraq's a Wild West\" appeared in the September 2003 issue of Maxim. In November 2003, the 3rd Cavalry conducted the highly successful and largely peaceful Operation Rifles Blitz. During the operation the city was sectioned into three portions and searched house-to-house over a two-week period. Large numbers of weapons and suspected insurgents were captured during the operation, but some ill will was earned during the operation since it prevented Ramadan celebrations from taking place that year. \n\nIn March 2004, the 3rd ACR conducted a turnover with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) of the 1st Marine Division. 3/7 served in Al Qa'im from March until September 2004. Shortly after the turnover was complete, the enemy launched a sustained offensive throughout the country, attempting to take advantage of the relative inexperience of the new force. This would become a common tactic as the war continued, but caught many units by surprise that spring.\n\nIn Al Qa'im, the activity heated up during April 2004 until the day of the battalion's pivotal battle on April 17. Although reports of enemy casualties are always difficult to quantify, the Marines likely killed 80 insurgents in the town of Husaybah that day, including foreign fighters. Five Marines from 3/7 were also killed in the battle. Units from every company in the battalion were engaged in Husaybah before the day was over.\n\nOn April 7, 2005, Iraqi insurgents captured the city, forcing the local police and US-supported Iraqi Soldiers to abandon the city. U.S. Marines launched several offensives in order to root out the insurgents and retake the city. On May 8, 2005, Marines launched the week-long Operation Matador to flush insurgents out of Qa'im. They faced stiff resistance from both local Iraqi fighters and foreign fighters, but succeeded.\n\nAccording to local residents, Qa'im remained largely under the control of the insurgents. Along with towns like Haditha, they imposed a Taliban-like law, in which Western music, clothing, and hairstyles are banned. In early September 2005, it was reported that a sign posted outside the town stated \"Welcome to the Islamic Republic of Qa'im\".\n\nIn 2006 Qa'im, like many cities in the Anbar province, was believed to still be under insurgent dominance. The primary economic activity of Qa'im was smuggling. Damage from previous battles has somewhat depressed the local economy.\n\nQa'im was under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from August 2014 to November 2017. In November 2014, unconfirmed reports indicated ISIS caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was travelling there and a coalition airstrike left him critically injured.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, an Iraqi Air Force airstrike at the town left 100 people dead including ISIS militants and civilians. It also injured another 100 people. \nBy November 2017, Al-Qa'im was one of the last towns still under control of ISIL. In the 2017 Western Iraq campaign, the Iraqi government advanced south of the city and by the end of October had reached its outskirts. They entered Al-Qa'im on 3 November 2017.\n\nAfter the eviction of ISIL forces, the Iraqi-based and Iranian-backed militia Kata'ib Hezbollah, a group under the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), and which is closely linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has played an important military and security role on the Iraqi side of the border. This role has continued after the reopening of the border crossing on 30 September 2019.\n\nOn 25 August 2019 a PMF convoy was hit by two drones near Al-Qa'im killing six, including a senior commander. PMF blamed Israel for the attack.\n\nThe Al-Qa'im border crossing between Abu Kamal in Syria and Al Qa'im in Iraq was reopened on 30 September 2019, after eight years of closure due to Syrian Civil War and Iraqi Civil War. \n\nOn 29 December 2019, the United States bombed a headquarters of Kata'ib Hezbollah. The airstrikes targeted three targets in Iraq and two in Syria of Kata'ib Hezbollah, and included weapons depots and command posts according to Reuters and a US military statement. The attack was in retaliation for the attack on the K-1 base two days earlier and other attacks on bases with US forces in Iraq. The earlier attack killed a US contractor and wounded four soldiers. Twenty-five people were killed in the US airstrikes.\n\nAl-Qa'im has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\").\n"}

{"id": "1831754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831754", "title": "Existential therapy", "text": "Existential therapy\n\nExistential psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy based on the model of human nature and experience developed by the existential tradition of European philosophy. It focuses on concepts that are universally applicable to human existence including death, freedom, responsibility, and the meaning of life. Instead of regarding human experiences such as anxiety, alienation and depression as implying the presence of mental illness, existential psychotherapy sees these experiences as natural stages in a normal process of human development and maturation. In facilitating this process of development and maturation, existential psychotherapy involves a philosophical exploration of an individual's experiences stressing the individual's freedom and responsibility to facilitate a higher degree of meaning and well-being in his or her life.\n\nThe philosophers who are especially pertinent to the development of existential psychotherapy are those whose works were directly aimed at making sense of human existence. For example, the fields of phenomenology and existential philosophy are especially and directly responsible for the generation of existential therapy.\n\nThe starting point of existential philosophy (see Warnock 1970; Macquarrie 1972; Mace 1999; Van Deurzen and Kenward 2005) can be traced back to the nineteenth century and the works of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Their works conflicted with the predominant ideologies of their time and committed to the exploration of reality as it can be experienced in a passionate and personal manner.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) protested vehemently against popular misunderstanding and abuse of Christian dogma and the so-called 'objectivity' of science (Kierkegaard, 1841, 1844). He thought that both were ways of avoiding the anxiety inherent in human existence. He had great contempt for the way life was lived by those around him and believed truth could only be discovered subjectively by the individual in action. He felt people lacked the courage to take a leap of faith and live with passion and commitment from the inward depth of existence. This involved a constant struggle between the finite and infinite aspects of our nature as part of the difficult task of creating a self and finding meaning. As Kierkegaard lived by his word, he was lonely and much ridiculed during his lifetime.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) took this philosophy of life a step further. His starting point was the notion that God is dead, that is, the idea of God was outmoded and limiting (Nietzsche, 1861, 1874, 1886). Furthermore, the Enlightenment—with the newfound faith in reason and rationality—had killed or replaced God with a new Truth that was perhaps more pernicious than the one it replaced. Science and rationality were the new \"God,\" but instead took the form of a deity that was colder and less comforting than before. Nietzsche exerted a significant impact upon the development of psychology in general, but he specifically influenced an approach which emphasized an understanding of life from a personal perspective. In exploring the various needs of the individual about the ontological conditions of being, Nietzsche asserted that all things are in a state of \"ontological privation,\" in which they long to become more than they are. This state of deprivation has major implications for the physiological and psychological needs of the individual.\n\nWhile Kierkegaard and Nietzsche drew attention to the human issues that needed to be addressed, Edmund Husserl's phenomenology (Husserl, 1960, 1962; Moran, 2000) provided the method to address them rigorously. He contended that natural sciences assume the separateness of subject and object and that this kind of dualism can only lead to error. He proposed a whole new mode of investigation and understanding of the world and our experience of it. He said that prejudice has to be put aside or 'bracketed,' for us to meet the world afresh and discover what is absolutely fundamental, and only directly available to us through intuition. If people want to grasp the essence of things, instead of explaining and analyzing them, they have to learn to describe and understand them.\n\nMax Scheler (1874-1928) developed philosophical anthropology from a material ethic of values (\"Materielle Wertethik\") that opposed Immanuel Kant's ethics of duty (\"Pflichtethik\"). He described a hierarchical system of values that further developed phenomenological philosophy. Scheler described the human psyche as being composed of four layers analogous to the layers of organic nature. However, in his description, the human psyche is opposed by the principle of the human spirit. Scheler's philosophy forms the basis of Viktor Frankl's logotherapy and existential analysis.\n\nMartin Heidegger (1889–1976) applied the phenomenological method to understanding the meaning of being (Heidegger, 1962, 1968). He argued that poetry and deep philosophical thinking could bring greater insight into what it means to be in the world than what can be achieved through scientific knowledge. He explored human beings in the world in a manner that revolutionized classical ideas about the self and psychology. He recognized the importance of time, space, death, and human relatedness. He also favored hermeneutics, an old philosophical method of investigation, which is the art of interpretation.\n\nUnlike interpretation as practiced in psychoanalysis (which consists of referring a person's experience to a pre-established theoretical framework), this kind of interpretation seeks to understand how the person himself/herself subjectively experiences something.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) contributed many other strands of existential exploration, particularly regarding emotions, imagination, and the person's insertion into a social and political world.\n\nThe philosophy of existence, on the contrary, is carried by a wide-ranging literature, which includes many authors, such as Karl Jaspers (1951, 1963), Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, and Hans-Georg Gadamer within the Germanic tradition and Albert Camus, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir and Emmanuel Lévinas within the French tradition (see for instance Spiegelberg, 1972, Kearney, 1986 or van Deurzen-Smith, 1997).\n\nFrom the start of the 20th century, some psychotherapists were, however, inspired by phenomenology and its possibilities for working with people.\n\nThe European School of existential analysis is dominated by two forms of therapy: Logotherapy, and Daseinsanalysis. Logotherapy was developed by psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl. Frankl was heavily influenced by existential philosophy, as well as his own experience in the Nazi concentration camps of World War II. The three main components to Logotherapy are Freedom of Will, which is the ability to change one's life to the degree that such change is possible, Will to Meaning, which places meaning at the center of well-being, and Meaning in Life, which asserts the objectivity of meaning. The primary techniques of Logotherapy involve helping the clients to identify and remove any barriers to the pursuit of meaning in their own lives, to determine what is personally meaningful, and to then help patients effectively pursue related goals.\n\nDaseinsanalysis is a psychotherapeutic system developed upon the ideas of Martin Heidegger, as well as the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, that seeks to help the individual find autonomy and meaning in their \"being in the world\" (a rough translation of \"Dasein\").\n\nBritain became a fertile ground for further development of the existential approach when R. D. Laing and David Cooper, often associated with the anti-psychiatry movement, took Sartre's existential ideas as the basis for their work (Laing, 1960, 1961; Cooper, 1967; Laing and Cooper, 1964). Without developing a concrete method of therapy, they critically reconsidered the notion of mental illness and its treatment. In the late 1960s, they established an experimental therapeutic community at Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, where people could come to live through their 'madness' without the usual medical treatment. They also founded the Philadelphia Association, an organization providing an alternative living, therapy, and therapeutic training from this perspective. The Philadelphia Association is still in existence today and is now committed to the exploration of the works of philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Derrida, Levinas, and Michel Foucault as well as the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. It also runs some small therapeutic households along these lines. The Arbours Association is another group that grew out of the Kingsley Hall experiment. Founded by Joseph Berke and Schatzman in the 1970s, it now runs a training program in psychotherapy, a crisis center, and several therapeutic communities. The existential input in the Arbours has gradually been replaced with a more neo-Kleinian emphasis.\n\nThe impetus for further development of the existential approach in Britain has primarily come from the development of some existentially based courses in academic institutions. This started with the programs created by Emmy van Deurzen, initially at Antioch University in London and subsequently at Regent's College, London and since then at the New School of Psychotherapy and Counseling, also located in London. The latter is a purely existentially based training institute, which offers postgraduate degrees validated by the University of Sheffield and Middlesex University. In the past few decades, the existential approach has spread rapidly and has become a welcome alternative to established methods. There are now many other, mostly academic, centers in Britain that provide training in existential counseling and psychotherapy and a rapidly growing interest in the approach in the voluntary sector and the National Health Service.\n\nBritish publications dealing with existential therapy include contributions by these authors: Jenner (de Koning and Jenner, 1982), Heaton (1988, 1994), Cohn (1994, 1997), Spinelli (1997), Cooper (1989, 2002), Eleftheriadou (1994), Lemma-Wright (1994), Du Plock (1997), Strasser and Strasser (1997), van Deurzen (1997, 1998, 2002), van Deurzen and Arnold-Baker (2005), and van Deurzen and Kenward (2005). Other writers such as Lomas (1981) and Smail (1978, 1987, 1993) have published work relevant to the approach, although not explicitly 'existential' in orientation. The journal of the British Society for Phenomenology regularly publishes work on existential and phenomenological psychotherapy. The Society for Existential Analysis was founded in 1988, initiated by van Deurzen. This society brings together psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and philosophers working from an existential perspective. It offers regular fora for discussion and debate as well as significant annual conferences. It publishes the \"Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis\" twice a year. It is also a member of the International Federation of Daseinsanalysis, which stimulates international exchange between representatives of the approach from around the world. An International Society for Existential Therapists also exists. It was founded in 2006 by Emmy van Deurzen and Digby Tantam and is called the International Community of Existential Counsellors and Therapists (ICECAP).\n\nNew developments in existential therapy in the last 20 years include existential positive psychology (EPP) and meaning therapy (MT). Different from the traditional approach to existential therapy, these new developments incorporate research findings from contemporary positive psychology.\n\nEPP can reframe the traditional issues of existential concerns into positive psychology questions that can be subjected to empirical research. It also focuses on personal growth and transformation as much as on existential anxiety. Later, EPP was incorporated into the second wave of positive psychology (PP 2.0).\n\nMeaning Therapy (MT) is an extension of Frankl's logotherapy and America's humanistic-existential tradition; it is also pluralistic because it incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, and positive psychotherapy, with meaning as its central organizing construct. MT not only appeals to people's natural desires for happiness and significance but also makes skillful use of their innate capacity for meaning-seeking and meaning-making. MT strikes a balance between a person-centered approach and a psycho-educational approach. At the outset of therapy, clients are informed of the use of meaning-centered interventions appropriate for their predicaments because of the empirical evidence for the vital role of meaning in healing and thriving. MT is a comprehensive and pluralistic way to address all aspects of clients' existential concerns. Clients can benefit from MT in two ways: (1) a custom-tailored treatment to solve their presenting problems, and (2) a collaborative journey to create a preferred better future.\n\nExistential therapy (of the American, existential-humanistic tradition) starts with the belief that although humans are essentially alone in the world, they long to be connected to others. People want to have meaning in one another's lives, but ultimately they must come to realize that they cannot depend on others for validation, and with that realization, they finally acknowledge and understand that they are fundamentally alone. The result of this revelation is anxiety in the knowledge that our validation must come from within and not from others.\n\nExistential therapy is based on a theory of mind, and of psychology. In existentialism, personality is based on choosing to be, authentically, the real you, given an understanding based on a philosophical idea of what a person is. Therefore, practical therapeutic applications can be derived give a theory of personality, emotion, and “the good life.”\n\nThis leads to practical therapeutic applications like dealing with personal choices in life that lead to personal happiness. Personal happiness based on a concept of yourself as having the freedom of directing your life and making necessary changes (so to speak, a radical freedom). So, a full philosophical understanding of existentialism is basic to methods implemented for emotional and life changes. That is, a background in philosophy is basic to existential therapy.\n\nPhilosophical issues of the self, personality, philosophy of mind, meaning of life, personal development are all fundamentally relevant to any practical therapeutic expectations. Existentialism\n\nBecause there is no single existential view, opinions about psychological dysfunction vary.\n\nFor theorists aligned with Yalom, psychological dysfunction results from the individual's refusal or inability to deal with the normal existential anxiety that comes from confronting life's \"givens\": mortality, isolation, meaninglessness, and freedom.\n\nFor other theorists, there is no such thing as psychological dysfunction or mental illness. Every way of being is merely an expression of how one chooses to live one's life. However, one may feel unable to come to terms with the anxiety of being alone in the world. If so, an existential psychotherapist can assist one in accepting these feelings rather than trying to change them as if there is something wrong. Everyone has the freedom to choose how they are going to exist in life; however, this freedom may go unpracticed. It may appear easier and safer not to make decisions that one will be responsible for. Many people will remain unaware of alternative choices in life for various societal reasons.\n\nExistentialism suggests that it is possible for individuals to face the anxieties of life head on, embrace the human condition of aloneness and to revel in the freedom to choose and take full responsibility for their choices. They can aim to take control of their lives and steer themselves in any direction they choose. There is no need to halt feelings of meaninglessness but instead to choose and focus on new meanings for the living. By building, loving and creating, life can be lived as one's own adventure. One can accept one's own mortality and overcome the fear of death. Although the French author Albert Camus denied the specific label of existentialist in his novel, \"L'Etranger\", the novel's main character, Meursault, ends the novel by doing just this. He accepts his mortality and rejects the constrictions of society he previously placed on himself, leaving him unencumbered and free to live his life with an unclouded mind. Also, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling, as has Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.\n\nThe strictly Sartrean perspective of existential psychotherapy is generally unconcerned with the client's past, but instead, the emphasis is on the choices to be made in the present and future. The counselor and the client may reflect upon how the client has answered life's questions in the past, but attention ultimately shifts to searching for a new and increased awareness in the present and enabling a new freedom and responsibility to act. The patient can then accept that they are not special and that their existence is simply coincidental, or without destiny or fate. By accepting this, they can overcome their anxieties and instead view life as moments in which they are fundamentally free.\n\nExistential thinkers seek to avoid restrictive models that categorize or label people. Instead, they look for the universals that can be observed cross-culturally. There is no existential personality theory which divides humanity into types or reduces people to part components. Instead, there is a description of the different levels of experience and existence with which people are inevitably confronted. The way in which a person is in the world at a particular stage can be charted on this general map of human existence (Binswanger, 1963; Yalom, 1980; van Deurzen, 1984).\n\nIn line with the view taken by van Deurzen, one can distinguish four basic dimensions of human existence: the physical, the social, the psychological, and the spiritual.\n\nOn each of these dimensions, people encounter the world and shape their attitude out of their particular take on their experience. Their orientation towards the world defines their reality. The four dimensions are interwoven and provide a complex four-dimensional force field for their existence. Individuals are stretched between a positive pole of what they aspire to on each dimension and a negative pole of what they fear. Binswanger proposed the first three of these dimensions from Heidegger's description of \"Umwelt\" and \"Mitwelt\" and his further notion of \"Eigenwelt\". The fourth dimension was added by van Deurzen from Heidegger's description of a spiritual world (\"Überwelt\") in Heidegger's later work.\n\nOn the physical dimension (\"Umwelt\"), individuals relate to their environment and the givens of the natural world around them. This includes their attitude to the body they have, to the concrete surroundings they find themselves in, to the climate and the weather, to objects and material possessions, to the bodies of other people, their own bodily needs, to health and illness and their mortality. The struggle on this dimension is, in general terms, between the search for domination over the elements and natural law (as in technology, or in sports) and the need to accept the limitations of natural boundaries (as in ecology or old age). While people generally aim for security on this dimension (through health and wealth), much of life brings a gradual disillusionment and realization that such security can only be temporary. Recognizing limitations can deliver a significant release of tension.\n\nOn the social dimension (\"Mitwelt\"), individuals relate to others as they interact with the public world around them. This dimension includes their response to the culture they live in, as well as to the class and race they belong to (and also those they do not belong to). Attitudes here range from love to hate and from cooperation to competition. The dynamic contradictions can be understood concerning acceptance versus rejection or belonging versus isolation. Some people prefer to withdraw from the world of others as much as possible. Others blindly chase public acceptance by going along with the rules and fashions of the moment. Otherwise, they try to rise above these by becoming trendsetters themselves. By acquiring fame or other forms of power, individuals can attain dominance over others temporarily. Sooner or later, however, everyone is confronted with both failure and aloneness.\n\nOn the psychological dimension (\"Eigenwelt\"), individuals relate to themselves and in this way create a personal world. This dimension includes views about their character, their past experience and their future possibilities. Contradictions here are often experienced regarding personal strengths and weaknesses. People search for a sense of identity, a feeling of being substantial and having a self.\n\nBut inevitably many events will confront them with evidence to the contrary and plunge them into a state of confusion or disintegration. Activity and passivity are an important polarity here. Self-affirmation and resolution go with the former and surrender and yielding with the latter. Facing the final dissolution of self that comes with personal loss and the facing of death might bring anxiety and confusion to many who have not yet given up their sense of self-importance.\n\nOn the spiritual dimension (\"Überwelt\") (van Deurzen, 1984), individuals relate to the unknown and thus create a sense of an ideal world, an ideology, and a philosophical outlook. It is there that they find meaning by putting all the pieces of the puzzle together for themselves. For some people, this is done by adhering to a religion or other prescriptive worldview; for others, it is about discovering or attributing meaning in a more secular or personal way. The contradictions that must be faced on this dimension are often related to the tension between purpose and absurdity, hope and despair. People create their values in search of something that matters enough to live or die for, something that may even have ultimate and universal validity. Usually, the aim is the conquest of a soul or something that will substantially surpass mortality (as in having contributed something valuable to humankind). Facing the void and the possibility of nothingness are the indispensable counterparts of this quest for the eternal.\n\nThere has not been a tremendous amount of research on existential therapy. Much of the research focuses on people receiving therapy who also have medical concerns such as cancer. Despite this, some studies have indicated positive efficacy for existential therapies with certain populations. Qualitative research has shown there is a positive learning outcome of Existential Therapy. Overall, however, more research is needed before definitive scientific claims can be made.\n\n"}

In Medieval and Renaissance England \"gown\" referred to a loose outer garment worn by both men and women, sometimes short, more often ankle length, with sleeves. By the 18th century \"gown\" had become a standard category term for a women's dress, a meaning it retained until the mid-20th century. Only in the last few decades has \"gown\" lost this general meaning in favor of \"dress\". Today the term \"gown\" is rare except in specialized cases: academic dress or \"cap and gown\", evening gown, nightgown, hospital gown, and so on (\"see\" Gown).\n\n\"Shirt\" and \"skirt\" are originally the same word, the former being the southern and the latter the northern pronunciation in early Middle English.\n\n\"Coat\" remains a term for an overgarment, its essential meaning for the last thousand years (\"see\" Coat).\n\nNames for new styles or fashions in clothing are frequently the deliberate inventions of fashion designers or clothing manufacturers; these include Chanel's Little Black Dress (a term which has survived) and Lanvin's \"robe de style\" (which has not). Other terms are of more obscure origin.\n\nClothing styles are frequently named after people—often with a military connection:\n\nAnother fertile source for clothing terms is place names, which usually reflect the origin (or supposed origin) of a fashion. Modern terms such as Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts, and Fair Isle sweaters are the latest in a long line that stretches back to \"holland\" (linen), \"damask\" (\"from Damascus\"), \"polonaise\" (\"in the fashion of Polish women\"), \"basque\", \"jersey\" (originally Jersey frock), \"Balaclava\", \"Capri pants\", \"mantua\", and \"denim\" (\"serge de Nîmes\" after the city).\n\nCostume historians, with a \"rearward-looking\" view, require names for clothing styles that were not used (or needed) when the styles were actually worn. For example, the Van Dyke collar is so-called from its appearances in 17th century portraits by Anthony van Dyck, and the Watteau pleats of the \"robe á la française\" are called after their appearance in the portraits of Antoine Watteau.\n\nSimilarly, terms may be applied ahistorically to entire categories of garments, so that \"corset\" is applied to garments that were called \"stays\" or a \"pair of bodies\" until the introduction of the word \"corset\" in the late 18th century. And \"dress\" is now applied to any women's garment consisting of a bodice and skirt, although for most of its history \"dress\" simply meant clothing, or a complete outfit of clothing with its appropriate accessories.\n\nA notable trend at the turn of the 21st century is \"cute\" short forms: camisole becomes \"cami\", hooded sweaters or sweatshirts become \"hoodies\", and as of 2005, short or \"shrunken\" cardigans are \"cardies\".\n\nThe much-older term \"shimmy\" for \"slip\" is most likely a false singular from chemise.\n\n"}

Schaft can be thought of as being a supergroup in that for the release of their debut album Switchblade Maki and Imai formed the core of the group and a rotating roster of collaborators, who are well known within their genres, were brought in to work on various songs. Raymond Watts of PIG was Schaft's most recurring collaborator, having contributed to half the songs on their debut album and toured with the band. After a long hiatus Schaft resumed activities in 2015.\n\nMaki and Imai originally formed Schaft in 1991 to record and release the song \"Nicht-Titel\" (German for \"Non-Title\") on the album \"Dance 2 Noise 001\", a compilation album of various Japanese electronic and industrial acts. A live concert event was held on December 16 of the same year for the purpose of promoting the \"Dance 2 Noise 001\" compilation and Schaft made their live debut, playing \"Nich-Titel\" and at least one other song (though the exact setlist is unknown).\n\nSchaft would remain dormant from then until 1994, when Imai's band Buck-Tick and Maki's band Soft Ballet toured together, giving the duo the opportunity to occasionally perform sets under the name Schaft., however the urge to reform Schaft must have come to the duo long before their live reunion, as only a month later they released their first full album of all new material.\n\nFor their debut album, Switchblade, Imai and Maki enlisted the help of several collaborators including members of Coil, Autechre and Meat Beat Manifesto but the most prominent collaborator was Raymond Watts who contributed to about half the material on the album and eventually went on a short tour with the group. The short support tour ran for five dates around Japan, one of which was filmed and later released to home video as \"Switchblade - Visual Mix\".\nAs can be seen in the video footage, these concerts would start with only Imai and Maki taking the stage, playing guitars and electronics respectively, with prerecorded vocals playing when necessary. Watts and drummer Motokatsu of The Mad Capsule Markets would join them on stage only a few songs into the setlist. A handful of the songs played live are alternate versions of what was released on \"Switchblade\" and were never made available outside of the live video. One exception to this would be a version of \"Cold Light\" which was used live and later found find a home of the Schaft remix EP, \"Switch\".\n\nDespite the project being popular in Japan, there were few further developments from Schaft after 1994. A promotional 12 inch \"Visual Cortex\" single was released in a limited run of 200 in 1995 consisting entirely of previously released material, after which point the band fell silent for several years.\n\nYears later in 1999, Schaft remixed one of Zilch's songs for their album Bastard Eyes and the duo of Imai and Maki made guest appearances on Zilch's \"Cut Your Edge Tour 99\" on three separate dates. However, while they were introduced to the audience as Schaft, they played alongside Zilch as guest musicians and did not play their own songs.\n\nIn 2001 Imai and Watts joined with Atsushi Sakurai and Sascha Konietzko to form the band Schwein, a somewhat spiritual successor to Schaft. Even further in the future, in 2006, the \"Hellsing\" OVA series used the Schaft song \"Broken English\" in a promotional trailer and, eventually went on to use the song within the show itself in OVA V.\n\nOn October 3, 2015, Schaft announced their reunion, together with dates for the oncoming TOUR ULTRA –The Loud Engine–.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gipson was born on a farm near Mason in the Texas Hill Country, the son of Beck Gipson and Emma Deishler.

There he wrote for the \"Daily Texan\" and \"The Ranger\", but he left school before graduating to become a newspaper journalist.\n\nIn the 1940s, Gipson began writing short stories with a western theme, which proved to be prototypes for his longer works of fiction that followed. In 1946, his first full-length book, \"The Fabulous Empire: Colonel Zack Miller's Story\", was published. \n\"Hound-Dog Man\", published in 1947, established Gipson's reputation when it became a Doubleday Book-of-the-Month Club selection and sold over 250,000 copies in its first year of publication.

He was a leading member of the Progressive Movement, serving for two years as a member of the Columbus, Ohio city council and campaigning against Boss Tweed as religious editor of the \"New York Independent\". Gladden was probably the first leading U.S. religious figure to support unionization of the workforce; he also opposed racial segregation. He was a prolific writer who wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books.\n\nGladden was born February 11, 1836, in Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, the son of Solomon and Amanda (Daniels) Gladden.\nHe was given the name Solomon Washington Gladden. When Gladden was six, his father died. After that, he lived with his uncle on a farm near Owego, New York. There, he learned and practiced a farmer's \"manual arts\" and used any free time for serious reading that included the Bible.\n\nDuring Gladden's formative years, western New York State was known as the Burned-Over District because it had been the center of a number of religious revivals. Gladden heard many preachers in a fruitless search for \"assurance of divine favor\" until, in his 18th year, a \"clear-headed minister\" helped him \"trust the Heavenly Father's love\" for him. From then on, Gladden believed that religion is \"summed up in the word Friendship:\" friendship \"with the Father above and the brother by our side.\"\n\nAt 16, Gladden left his uncle's farm to become an apprentice at the \"Owego Gazette'\nTwo years later (1854) at age 18, he became part of the temperance movement by joining the order of the Good Templars.\n\nDuring his newspaper apprenticeship, Gladden made his \"choice of a calling:\" to become an ordained minister in the Congregational Church. Since the calling required further study, he enrolled in the Owego Free Academy and later enrolled in and graduated from Williams College in the class of 1859.\n\nAt Williams, Gladden wrote its alma mater song, \"The Mountains.\"\n\nDuring his early career, Gladden held five positions in pastorates and journalism.\n\nIn 1860, a pivotal year for Gladden, he received his first call to a pastorate, which was followed by ordination, marriage, the secession of southern states, and the impending Civil War.\n\nGladden's first call was to State Street Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. He began his pastorate in June 1860 and was ordained in November.\n\nOn December 5, 1860 Gladden and Jennie O. Cohoon, a schoolmate at the Oswego Free Academy, were married. The couple had two daughters, two sons, and one granddaughter.\n\nThose events in Gladden's life came during what he recalled as \"ominous and exciting events\" in the nation's life. South Carolina seceded from the Union and was followed within two months by six other states.\n\nIn June 1861, Gladden resigned and accepted a call to the Congregational Church at Morrisania, New York, where he served until 1866. In 1863, Gladden took leave to serve in the Christian Chaplaincy Corps. However, he contracted malaria, which forced him to return home for recovery and to resume his pastoral duties.\n\nGladden's third pastorate was in North Adams, Massachusetts, where he served from 1866 to 1871.\n\nGladden's next position was the religious editor of the \"New York Independent\" from 1871 and 1875. The weekly newspaper had a nationwide circulation of one million. Gladdens's role was to write news articles and editorials on practical theology and the day's social issues. From that position, Gladden national fame, especially for his aid in exposing the corrupt organization of Boss Tweed.\n\nIn 1875, Gladden became pastor of the North Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, for seven years. During that pastorate, Gladden also worked as editor of \"Sunday Afternoon\" (1878–1880). \"Sunday Afternoon\" described itself as \"A Monthly Magazine for the Household.\" Besides editing, Gladden also contributed articles.\n\nGladden's active support for workers and their right to organize began during his years in North Adams and Springfield. His position aroused the opposition of mill and factory owners, but he was not deterred and continued his work for justice the rest of his life. Although Gladden was deeply concerned for the well-being of workers, scholars have noted that his early lectures in 1875 and 1876 lacked the understanding of the industrial system that was characteristic of his later writings. In that era, Gladden acknowledged that the economic problems were also moral but \"contributed little that the most conservative of industrial leaders would not have admitted to be the case.\"\n\nHe published \"Working People and their Employers\" in 1876, which advocated the unionization of employees, and was the first notable US clergyman to approve of unions. Gladden did not support socialism or laissez-faire but advocated instead the application of \"Christian law\" to issues.\n\nGladden's 1877 book \"The Christian Way: Whither it Leads and How to Go On\" was his first national call for \"the extension of Christian values into everyday life\" and began his leadership in the Social Gospel movement.\nGladden became the pastor of the First Congregational Church in Columbus, Ohio, in 1882 and served in that position for thirty-six years. During that time, he furthered his national reputation as a religious leader and as a community leader by his preaching, lecturing, writing, and active involvement.\n\nThe First Congregational Church stood opposite the Ohio state capitol. Its congregation included legislators and other persons with the power to address the social injustices about which Gladden preached.\n\nGladden preached two 45-minute sermons each Sunday. In the morning, he preached on living the Christian life. In the evening, he preached on social problems. The evening sermon was printed in \"The Ohio State Journal\" the next day on page one.\nDuring First Church's 1902 Golden Jubilee Celebration, Gladden said on his preaching that \"you have not always agreed with me; you could not; but when my words, and sometimes my conduct were opposed to your thoughts and interests, you never tried to muzzle me.\"\n\nBy the mid-1880s, Gladden drew audiences across the nation to hear him speak for \"bargaining rights for labor, a shorter work week, factory inspections, inheritance taxation, and regulation of natural monopolies.\" His goal was for \"a gradual evolution toward a cooperative social order.\"\n\nTheologically, Gladden is classified an \"evangelical liberal.\" As such, he was biblically grounded and centered, but always seeking to \"adjust Christianity to modern times\" He helped to promote his evangelical liberalism in books such as \"Burning Questions\" (1890) and \"Who Wrote the Bible\" (1891). In \"Who Wrote the Bible\", Gladden stated: \"it is idle to try to force the narrative of Genesis into an exact correspondence with geological science.\"\n\nIn 1885, Gladden took part in forming the American Economic Association and served on its Council. The stated purpose of the association was \"to support independent economic inquiry and to disseminate economic knowledge.\"\n\nIn 1886, he traveled to Cleveland during a streetcar strike, spoke at a public meeting on \"Is it Peace or War,\" and supported the rights of the workers to form a union to protect their interests. He also advocated public ownership of streetcars and public utilities.\n\nThe more Gladden addressed social issues, the more his church grew: from 500 in 1883 to 1,200 in 1914. When members disagreed with Gladden, rather than trying to bring them to agree with him, he sought to find common ground on which they could they stand together.\n\nIn 1893, former US President Rutherford B. Hayes presented Gladden for the position of president of Ohio State University, but the Board rejected him as \"too pro-Catholic\" because of his opposition to the anti-Catholic American Protective Association. However, the University of Notre Dame awarded Gladden an honorary doctorate for his stance.\n\nGladden made several lecture tours to Great Britain. During the one in 1898, he defended the United States for entering the Spanish–American War as \"humane.\"\n\nGladden exerted an international influence as the \"father\" of the Social Gospel movement. His concern about social issues was grounded on his liberal theology that viewed the Church's mission as applying Christian values to secular institutions.\n\nGladden served a term on the Columbus City Council between 1900 and 1902 and became an advocate of municipal ownership of public works. He also led a movement to change the elections in Ohio from October to November.\n\nGladden was one of his nation's \"most progressive leaders\" in efforts to resolve what he called \"The Negro Problem,\" both economically and politically. He was Vice President of the American Missionary Association between 1894 and 1901 and served as its president between 1901 and 1904. In thiat capacity, he traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to visit Atlanta University and meet W. E. B. Du Bois. He was shocked at the condition of Southern blacks and started speaking out against racism. Gladden's famous 1903 sermon \"Murder as an Epidemic\" condemned lynching.\n\nHe resigned as President of the American Missionary Association to take up a position as the Moderator of the National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States in 1904.\n\nIn 1905, he made national news by denouncing a $100,000 gift to the Congregationalists from John D. Rockefeller as \"tainted.\"\n\nIn 1914, Gladden retired and became \"minister emeritus\" of the First Congregational Church. He remained active in other ways until he died of a stroke on July 2, 1918. The \"New York Times\" carried the news that \"Gladden, nationally known Congregational minister\" had died.\n\nGladden was predeceased by Jennie, his wife of 49 years, who died May 8, 1909. The last four years of her life she suffered arteriosclerosis that brought her to a state of bed-ridden dementia. Never in the limelight, Jennie was \"quietly supportive of her husband's very public career.\"\n\nThe Gladdens had two daughters (one of whom died at 24) and two sons. Alcohol and personal problems beset the sons and they both died young. The difficulties with the Gladdens' sons occurred within a larger similar context. Post-Civil War America was marked by \"inward trouble in middle-class family life.\" Youth felt \"great uncertainty\" about their identity and their life's work. This made it difficult for them to \"settle on careers.\" Large numbers suffered \"nervous collapses.\"\n\nHistorians assessing Gladden's career emphasize the importance of his role in the Social Gospel movement. Gladden became the social gospel's \"most revered and respected spokesman\" Gladden not only promoted a \"Social Gospel of practical action\" by his writing and speaking, he engaged in practical action by working for solutions. Gladden supported workers' right to unionize and he opposed racial segregation.\n\nThese assessments by historians correlate with the goal Gladden held up for his ministry. In his 1909 autobiography \"Recollections\", Gladden wrote that, as a minister, he wanted to practice \"a religion that laid hold upon life, and proposed first and foremost, to realize the Kingdom of God in this world.\"\n\nGladden never earned a theological degree, but he received 35 honorary doctorates.\"\n\nGladden is honored together with Walter Rauschenbusch and Jacob Riis with a feast day in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on July 2.\n\nWashington Gladden wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books. Gladden's hymn \"O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee\" has been published in 470 hymnals. His books follow:\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2018 an estimated 2.2 million people had HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean, making the HIV prevalence rate approximately 0.4% in Latin America.\n\nSome demographic groups in Latin America have higher prevalence rates for HIV/ AIDS including men who have sex with men having a prevalence rate of 10.6%, and transgender women having one of the highest rates within the population with a prevalence rate of 17.7%. Female sex workers and drug users also have higher prevalence for the disease than the general population (4.9% and 1%-49.7% respectively).\n\nOne aspect that has contributed to the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS in LGBTQIA+ groups in Latin America is the concept of homophobia. Homophobia in Latin America has historically affected HIV service provision through under reported data and less priority through government programs.\n\nAntiretroviral treatment coverage has been high, with AIDS related deaths decreasing between 2007 to 2017 by 12%, although the rate of new infections has not seen a large decrease. The cost of antiretroviral medicines remain a barrier for some in Latin America, as well as country wide shortages of medicines and condoms. In 2017 77% of Latin Americans with HIV were aware of their HIV status.\n\nThe prevention of HIV/AIDS in Latin America among groups with a higher prevalence such as men who have sex with men and transgender women, has been aided with educational outreach, condom distribution, and LGBTQIA+ friendly clinics. Other main prevention methods include condom availability, education and outreach, HIV awareness, and mother-to-child transmission prevention.\n\nThe first documented reporting of what would come to be known as HIV/AIDS happened in June 1981. In September of 1982, AIDS is given its name and a case definition for the very first time. Specific details on the origin of HIV/AIDS in Latin America are lacking, but in 1983, the first known HIV cases in Latin America were confirmed in Mexico and Haiti in the form of the HIV-1. Blood screening in Mexico was scare in the early 1990s, which contributed to 63% of female AIDS cases stemming from blood transfusions. Currently, the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS in Latin America is highest in Belize (2%), Honduras (1.9%), Panama (1.54%) and  Guatemala (1.4%). Since 2000, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean has been highest in Haiti (5.2%), the Bahamas (4.1%), and the Dominican Republic (2.8%).\n\nIn order to prevent and slow the transmission rates within the Latin American population public health initiatives need to target vulnerable populations. Providing treatment, education, and health services that are stigma-free and accessible to vulnerable populations is key to combating the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Latin America. Another common barrier in accessing health services among transgender women is a mistrust of the health system as a whole from past discrimination towards this community within the health system.\n\nTo prevent transmission between individuals, safe sex practices and treatment using antiretroviral treatment is a necessary public health intervention. Within Latin America as of 2018, 62% of those that are aware of their positive HIV status are currently on antiretroviral therapy, and of those individuals only 55% of them are virally suppressed, and carry an undetectable load. This accounts for 29% of the entire HIV positive community in Latin America.\n\nPractices to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS\n\n\nThese safe sex practices reduce the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Many of these treatments are not widely available and accessible to vulnerable populations within Latin America. In order to successfully implement these prevention methods the stigma and discrimination surrounding vulnerable populations needs to be addressed within the present health systems in Latin America.\n\nWithin Latin America there are many barriers to prevention methods, including late diagnostic testing of patients, lack of testing centers in rural communities, and the stigma/discrimination within the HIV positive population.\n\nRecently in Bahamas, Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago self tests were made available, and have the potential to increase testing in at-risk populations. However the accessibility and affordability of the tests is under scrutiny from public health professionals. Other public health initiatives include education regarding safe sex practice use and condom availability. Programs in Mexico and Brazil that aimed to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is an important initiative that has been relatively successful at reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in this population from 16.7% in 2010 to 10.4% in 2017.\n\n\n"}

She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1990 who represented the central Ontario riding of London South. She was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.\n\nSmith was educated at St. Michael's College in the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. She was the founding member of Mme. Vanier Children's Services and Diocesan Catholic Social Services in London, Ontario, and served on the board of governors for the University of Western Ontario. In 2001, Smith received a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Western Ontario. Smith lived in London, Ontario. Her husband Don Smith was the co-founder of EllisDon, an employee-owned construction services company that was incorporated in 1951 in London, Ontario. She and Don raised seven children. She died in London after suffering a head injury in St. Lucia in February 2016. She was 88.\n\nIn 1976, Smith was elected to council for London City Council. She served as alderman for nine years and was a controller for two of those years. She was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Gordon Walker by 6,683 votes in the constituency of London South. She was re-elected by an increased majority in the 1987 election, and appointed to cabinet as Solicitor General on September 29, 1987.\n\nSmith was forced to resign her office on June 6, 1989. She had received a telephone call in the middle of the night from a constituent worried about the safety of a missing brother, and telephoned the police to express her concern. The opposition argued that this was an improper act, in that Smith's position as Solicitor-General could result in the case receiving preferential treatment. Thomas Walkom wrote a newspaper column about this matter, entitled \"Even decent politicians may need to resign\".\n\nSmith later served as Chief Government Whip. In the 1990 provincial election, she lost to NDP candidate David Winninger by 5,651 votes. She attempted a comeback in the 1995 election but finished third, behind Winninger and PC candidate Bob Wood.\n"}

SIS enrolls more than 3,000 students from over 150 countries. The school makes extensive use of the academic and governmental resources offered by its location in Washington, D.C. The School of International Service consistently ranks highly among international relations programs. SIS is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs. SIS also has partnerships with schools such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs. \n\nThe founding of schools of international affairs was urged by President Dwight D. Eisenhower during the height of the Cold War. His initiative called together thirteen University presidents, including AU's Hurst Robins Anderson, encouraging them to create human-focused international affairs programs dedicated to preparing practitioners for foreign policy beyond the U.S.–Soviet rivalry. In response, SIS was founded with the mission to establish a school based on service to the global community. In 1958, the school admitted its first full-time class, replacing AU's Department of International Relations. The class consisted of 85 students representing 36 countries.\n\nIn 1967, SIS added its International Communications program, the first such program offered by an American university. In 1981 SIS inaugurated the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies to address concerns that American universities lacked an appropriate venue for exploring the greater Muslim-Western understanding. In the 1990s, SIS established dual degree programs with Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan and Korea University in Seoul, Korea. In 1991, SIS added the Center for the Global South, followed in 1995 by the addition of the Mohammed Said Farsi Chair in Islamic Peace, and in 2000 with a joint program on National Resources and Sustainable Development with the United Nations University for Peace. New degree options implemented in 2010 include the Global Scholars Program, a concentrated three-year B.A. program, an M.A. program in Social Enterprise, and, in partnership with the U.S. Peace Corps, a Master's International degree combining a Peace Corps assignment with SIS academic work.\n\nIn 2004, plans were initiated for a new, , academic building designed by architect William McDonough, which was completed in spring 2010. It is a LEED Gold-certified building, featuring of photovoltaic solar panels, low-flow faucets to reduce water consumption, and three solar water heating systems.\n\nClocks and Clouds is American University's undergraduate journal of international affairs.\n\nThe Journal of International Service is American University's graduate journal of international affairs.\n\nIntercultural Management Quarterly is published by the Intercultural Management Institute, which provides customized training for effective communication, negotiation, and leadership across cultures.\n\nThe School of International Service offers a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies.

It was released on 28 October 1985 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was a huge commercial success, reaching high positions on charts worldwide and peaking at number 15 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, eventually selling more than 11 million units worldwide. The album was recorded at Eel Pie Studios in Twickenham, London, and produced by Tony Mansfield, John Ratcliff and Alan Tarney.\n\nIn all, five singles from the album were released, though not all were released internationally: \"Take On Me\", \"Love Is Reason\", \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\", \"Train of Thought\" and \"Hunting High and Low\". The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards in 1986, making A-ha the first Norwegian band to be nominated for a Grammy.\n\nAs part of a re-release of their first two albums, \"Hunting High and Low\" was expanded and remastered in 2010.\n\n\"Take On Me\" was the first single released by the band. An early version was recorded and released in late 1984 with an early music video. The song became a #3 hit in A-ha's native Norway but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The band went back into the studio to re-record the song for the \"Hunting High and Low\" album, but a second UK release in early 1985 was again ignored. Before releasing their single in the United States, the band undertook the production of a new music video for the song, working with director Steve Barron. Barron had previously created hit videos for Toto, Thomas Dolby, Culture Club and Michael Jackson, but the A-ha video was unlike any of his earlier work. A plot-driven amalgamation of live-action and rotoscope-style animation by husband-and-wife team Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger, it drew inspiration from Patterson's animated film \"Commuter\" and the film \"Altered States\". The innovative video for \"Take On Me\" was first broadcast on local Boston music video station V-66, and soon after given heavy rotation on MTV.\n\nThe single debuted in \"Billboard\" the week of 13 July 1985, and was heading into the U.S. top twenty when it was given an international release, including a second release in Norway and a third shot at the UK market. It hit number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States, spending 27 weeks on the charts and becoming the tenth-biggest single of 1985, and this time going to number two in the United Kingdom and number one in Norway. In all, the song reached number one in 36 countries, becoming one of the world's best-selling singles of all time with nearly 9 million copies sold.\n\nThe second single for most of the world was \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" (\"Love Is Reason\" had failed to hit the Norwegian Top 40 earlier in the year), and the band followed its massively successful music video with another critically acclaimed clip for the song. Starting off as a sequel of sorts, Harket breaks away from his happy ending to join his band in performance amidst mannequins at a rural church, Saint Albans in Teddington, which has since become an art gallery. \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" improved upon the first single's success in the United Kingdom, hitting number one and remaining there for two weeks in January 1986. It was a top-10 hit nearly everywhere it was released except in the United States, where it peaked at #20 and would be the band's last major hit to date in that country. The single sold 5 million copies around the world. The track was remixed as a dance version, which was a top-5 hit on the U.S. Dance chart, and B-side to the single and remix was the otherwise unreleased \"Driftwood.\"\n\n\"Train of Thought\" saw limited release as the third single in Europe. It was not released as a 7\" in the United States but received rock radio play and a set of remixes again made the dance charts. Waaktaar based the lyrics for this song on existentialist authors and poets Gunvor Hofmo, Knut Hamsun and Fyodor Dostoevsky, his favourites at the time. It was A-ha's third consecutive Top 10 single in the United Kingdom and Ireland, reaching #8 and #5 respectively, and charting well in Germany and Sweden. World sales hit 500,000 copies.\n\nThe last single from the album was \"Hunting High and Low\", released in June 1986. The single saw its highest chartings in France, where it peaked at number four, and the United Kingdom, where it was number five. The single was released in the United States but did not make the Hot 100. An extended version was available on 12\" vinyl, but the midtempo track did not see dance chart success.\n\nColdplay, a band influenced by A-ha, has been known to perform \"Hunting High and Low\" in concert.\n\nThe \"Take On Me\" video was nominated for eight 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, and at the third annual ceremony 5 September 1986, the video won six awards, including Best New Artist and Viewer's Choice. \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" was nominated for an additional three awards, winning two, for a total of eight wins. Even as the total number of categories has nearly doubled, only one other artist to date has won as many MTV Awards in a single year. Peter Gabriel won nine the following year for \"Sledgehammer\" and \"Big Time,\" two videos which progressed further down the roads A-ha ventured in groundbreaking use of animation in music video.\n\nIn 2002, \"Take On Me\" was ranked at number eight on \"VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders\", although this status is slightly misleading as it reflects A-ha's lack of mainstream success in the United States; the group was by no means a one-hit wonder elsewhere or in career terms. In 2006, \"Take On Me\" was ranked number 24 on \"VH1's Greatest Songs of the 1980s\".\n\nOn February 17, 2020, the music video for \"Take On Me\" reached 1 billion views on YouTube. At the time, only four songs from the entire 20th century had reached the mark — \"November Rain\" and \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana, and Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" — making \"Take on Me\" the fifth video from that time period to ever do so. A-ha also became the first European act to accomplish this achievement.\n\nThe cover photograph was taken by Just Loomis and was nominated in 1986 for a Grammy as \"Album Cover of the Year.\"\n\nThe band released a live version of \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" in 2003.\n\n\"Hunting High and Low\" was \"a\"-ha's breakout album. Upon its release in October 1985, \"Hunting High and Low\" peaked at number 15 on the \"Billboard\"'s Top 200 album chart. The album granted A-ha international recognition. \"Hunting High and Low\" got 3x platinum status in the UK and Platinum status in the United States and Germany, and Gold status in Brazil, and the Netherlands.The album reached #11 in the European top-100 albums sales chart.\n\nThe album peaked at 15 in the U.S., according to \"Billboard\" music charts and has sold about 1.8 million copies in the U.S. It peaked at 2 on the UK charts (re-enter at number 83 in 2015), and hit 1 in Norway. The album has been certified platinum in the United States and 3x platinum in UK. On the \"Billboard\" 200, \"Hunting High and Low\" held the record for the highest-charting album by a Norwegian artist until \"Do It Again\" by Norwegian duo Röyksopp and Swedish singer Robyn (which peaked at number 14).\n\nBeginning with the single \"Take On Me\", A-ha's debut album sold more than eight million copies worldwide and spawned two number one hits. In the fall of 1986, \"Take On Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" were nominated for 11 MTV Video Awards combined, and A-ha won eight of these.\n\nTim DiGravina of AllMusic Guide said \"It's a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener's need for a synth pop fix... One can't escape the feeling that Hunting High and Low is a product of the 1980s, but with highs like 'Take On Me' and 'The Sun Always Shines on TV,' and no lows in sight, A-ha's debut is a treat worth relishing.\"\n\nThe album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nThe album has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.\n\nIn June 1986, A-ha began a world tour which went through to February 1987. The band had never played a single concert when \"Take On Me\" shot to #1 in America; soon it could boast a 16-country, 113-city tour under its belt along with countless interviews and television appearances.\n\nOn 6 May 2010, the band announced the remaster and re-release of the album. The two disc album will comprise the original album and four 12\" tracks on one disc, while the second will feature 19 rare demos and unreleased songs from this era.\n\nOn 6 July 2010 the albums \"Hunting High and Low\" and \"Scoundrel Days\" were released as deluxe editions in the United States through Rhino Records and both albums debuted in the Top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Top Internet Sales Chart; \"Hunting High and Low\" at #34 and \"Scoundrel Days\" at #36.\n\n\"Hunting High and Low\" (remaster) charts: #39 Germany, #32 Norway, #27 Hungary, #165 UK\n\n\"Scoundrel Days\" (remaster) charts: #52 Germany, #27 Norway, #190 UK\n\n\nThere are also four bonus download-only tracks on each release, available in most countries:\n"}

He was for a while a student under Jean Girardet, and then, on. the advice of a Lunville Academician, Madame Coster, set up a studio for himself. In 1784 he journeyed to Rome, returning after four years careful study, and in 1788 was accepted as an Academician and granted an apartment in the Louvre. He married Marie-Nicole, the daughter of Antoine Vestier, the miniature painter, and had two sons, Aristide and Bias, both of whom became painters.\n\nDumont was one of the three greatest miniature painters of France, painting portraits of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Louis XVIII and Charles X, and of almost all the important persons of his day. His own portrait was engraved both by Francis Audouin and by Jean-Charles Tardieu.\n\nHe resided the greater part of his life in Paris, and there he died. A younger brother, Tony Dumont, was also a miniature painter, a pupil of his brother, a frequent exhibitor and the recipient of a medal from the Academy in 1810. Each artist signed with the surname only, and there is some controversy concerning the attribution to each artist of his own work. Tony was an expert violinist and delighted in painting portraits of persons who were playing upon the violin.\n\nMany of Dumont's finest paintings came into the collection of J. P. Morgan, but others are in the Louvre, presented by the heir of Bias Dumont. The work of both painters is distinguished by breadth, precision and a charming scheme of coloring, and the unfinished works of the elder brother are amongst some of the most beautiful miniatures ever produced.\n\n"}

He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1954 and the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1964 to 1970. Hansen moved to Alameda, Idaho, and was established as a life insurance salesman by 1958.\n\nHansen was elected mayor of Alameda in 1961 and supported its merger with Pocatello the following year. Following the merger, Hansen served as a Pocatello city commissioner until 1965.\n\nHe was an unsuccessful candidate in the primary for the U.S. Senate in 1962, but won a seat in the House two years later in the 2nd district, ousting Democratic incumbent Ralph Harding. He was one of the few Republican challengers to unseat a Democrat in the wake of Lyndon Johnson's 44-state landslide that year.\n\nHe again ran for the U.S. Senate in 1968, but lost to two-term incumbent Frank Church, who would serve four terms. Hansen ran a third unsuccessful Senate campaign in 1972, losing the primary to 1st district congressman Jim McClure.\n\nIn 1974, Hansen upset three-term incumbent Orval Hansen in the August primary and won the general election to return to the U.S. House. In Washington, Hansen was known as one of the most conservative members of Congress, and a particularly vocal critic of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCongressman Hansen went to Tehran in 1979 in the middle of the Iran hostage crisis to try to negotiate with the hostage takers through the fence of the U.S. Embassy.

He was accused of concealing more than $245,000 in loans and $87,000 in profits from silver speculation, much of it in his wife's name.\n\nIn 1984 Hansen was convicted of violating the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. He had failed to disclose $334,000 in personal loans to his campaign. He was sentenced to six months in prison and fined $40,000. Appealing all the way to the US Supreme Court, his conviction was vacated and the fine returned to him.\n\nIn 1992, Hansen was in prison again on charges of defrauding two Idaho banks and 100 individuals in a $30 million investment scheme.

He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2002 and again as a unanimous All-American senior in 2004, and received the Lou Groza Award as the nation's top college placekicker in 2004. \n\nHe also was part of the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes Division I National Championship team. He became the first kicker in school history to earn team most valuable player honors.\n\nNugent was selected by the New York Jets in the second round (47th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. During the opening game of the 2008 NFL season, Nugent injured his quadriceps following an extra point. To replace Nugent the Jets signed Jay Feely, who performed so well in the position that he became the Jets' starter while Nugent, who eventually recovered from his injury, was forced to stay on the bench.\n\nAs an unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Nugent signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 4 and won the job over Matt Bryant in the preseason due to Bryant's injury. After converting just two of his first six tries (2 blocked) through four games, Nugent was released by the Buccaneers on October 5.\n\nNugent signed with the Arizona Cardinals on December 16, 2009 as a temporary replacement for the injured Neil Rackers. He was waived by the Cardinals on January 2, 2010.\n\nNugent signed with the Cincinnati Bengals on April 23, 2010. He competed with Dave Rayner throughout training camp and the preseason for the Bengals starting job. Nugent eventually won the competition when the Bengals released Rayner on September 4, 2010, after Nugent made 54- and 52-yard field goals in the team's final two preseason games. Nugent was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for the month of September by going 8 for 8 on field goal tries in the Bengals' first three games of the season. \n\nIn 2011, Nugent set franchise records for points (132) and field goals (33). He signed a one-year contract tender with the Bengals for the 2012 season, and on March 10, 2013, the Bengals re-signed Nugent to a two-year deal. On September 7, 2014, Nugent tied the NFL record for most field goals made in one half with 5. \n\nOn January 4, 2015, Nugent kicked a career-long 58-yard field goal during the AFC first-round playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts. On October 11, 2015, Nugent made a winning field goal against the Seattle Seahawks in overtime in Week 5, 2015.\n\nNugent was released by the Bengals on December 13, 2016 after missing five PAT attempts in five games.\n\nOn August 1, 2017, Nugent signed with the New York Giants where he would compete with Aldrick Rosas for the starting position. At the conclusion of the preseason, Nugent was cut from the Giants' roster on September 2, 2017.\n\nOn October 24, 2017, Nugent was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as a stand-in for injured Dan Bailey, reuniting with Rich Bisaccia who was his special teams coach with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was released on November 26, after Bailey was deemed healthy from his previous groin injury. He made 7 out of 9 field goals in four games.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, the Chicago Bears signed Nugent to replace the injured Cairo Santos. In Week 17, Nugent tied his personal record when he converted a 55-yard field goal.\n\nOn August 4, 2018, Nugent signed with the Oakland Raiders. He was placed on injured reserve on September 26, 2018 after suffering a hip injury in Week 3.\n\nOn October 3, 2019, Nugent signed with the New England Patriots after they placed Stephen Gostkowski on injured reserve. He was released on October 29, 2019 after missing two kicks in a game against the Cleveland Browns. In four games with the Patriots, Nugent went 5-of-8 on field goals and 15-of-16 on extra points.\n\n"}
{"id": "1831837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831837", "title": "Axis mundi", "text": "Axis mundi\n\nIn astronomy, axis mundi is the Latin term for the Earth axis (the celestial pole).\nIn a geocentric coordinate system, this is the axis of rotation of the celestial sphere. \nConsequently, in ancient Greco-Roman astronomy, the \"axis mundi\" is the axis of rotation of the planetary spheres of the classical geocentric model of the cosmos.\n\nIn 20th-century comparative mythology, the term axis mundi (variously also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, center of the world, world tree) was greatly extended to refer to any mythological concept representing \"the connection between Heaven and Earth\" or the \"higher and lower realms\".\nThe concept was introduced by Mircea Eliade in the 1950s. It is closely related to the mythological concept of \"omphalos\" (navel) of the world or cosmos.\nItems adduced as examples of the \"axis mundi\" by comparative mythologists include plants (notably a tree but also other types of plants such as a vine or stalk), a mountain, a column of smoke or fire, or a product of human manufacture (such as a staff, a tower, a ladder, a staircase, a maypole, a cross, a steeple, a rope, a totem pole, a pillar, a spire). \nIts proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious (pagoda, temple mount, minaret, church) or secular (obelisk, lighthouse, rocket, skyscraper). The image appears in religious and secular contexts. The \"axis mundi\" symbol may be found in cultures utilizing shamanic practices or animist belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced \"urban centers\". In Mircea Eliade's opinion, \"Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all.\" The axis mundi is often associated with mandalas.\n\nThe symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the spot one occupies stands at \"the center of the world\". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night. From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of China, meaning \"Middle Nation\" ( pinyin: \"\"), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.\n\nWithin the central known universe a specific locale-often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest gains status as center of the center, the axis mundi. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base. Mount Kunlun fills a similar role in China. For the ancient Hebrews Mount Zion expressed the symbol. Sioux beliefs take the Black Hills as the axis mundi. Mount Kailash is holy to Hinduism and several religions in Tibet. The Pitjantjatjara people in central Australia consider Uluru to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient Mesopotamia the cultures of ancient Sumer and Babylon erected artificial mountains, or ziggurats, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. Amarnath, Tirupati, Vaishno Devi etc. The pre-Columbian residents of Teotihuacán in Mexico erected huge pyramids featuring staircases leading to heaven. These Amerindian temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld. Jacob's Ladder is an axis mundi image, as is the Temple Mount. For Christians the Cross on Mount Calvary expresses the symbol. The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, Kunlun, known in Taoist literature as \"the mountain at the middle of the world.\" To \"go into the mountains\" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life. Monasteries of all faiths tend, like shrines, to be placed at elevated spots. Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.\n\nBecause the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as \"the center of the world\". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once. Mount Hermon was regarded as the axis mundi in Canaanite tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in 1 Enoch (1En6:6). The ancient Armenians had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was Mount Ararat, which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe. Likewise, the ancient Greeks regarded several sites as places of earth's \"omphalos\" (navel) stone, notably the oracle at Delphi, while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic world tree and in Mount Olympus as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the Temple Mount, Christianity has the Mount of Olives and Calvary, Islam has the Ka'aba, said to be the first building on earth, and the Temple Mount (Dome of the Rock). In Hinduism, Mount Kailash is identified with the mythical Mount Meru and regarded as the home of Shiva; in Vajrayana Buddhism, Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the dragon currents converge and is regarded as the gateway to Shambhala. In Shinto, the Ise Shrine is the omphalos. In addition to the Kunlun Mountains, where it is believed the peach tree of immortality is located, the Chinese folk religion recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.\n\nSacred places constitute world centers (omphalos) with the altar or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. \"Every temple or palace—and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence—is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre.\" The stupa of Hinduism, and later Buddhism, reflects Mount Meru. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a cross, with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. Pagoda structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A steeple in a church or a minaret in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the maypole, derived from the Saxons' Irminsul, and the totem pole among indigenous peoples of the Americas also represent world axes. The calumet, or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center. A mandala creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.\n\nIn the Classical elements and the Vedic Pancha Bhoota the axis mundi corresponds to Aether, the quintessence.\n\nPlants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the Cosmic Tree provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots). In some Pacific island cultures the banyan tree, of which the Bodhi tree is of the Sacred Fig variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called \"ashwath vriksha\" (\"I am banyan tree among trees\" – \"Bhagavad Gita\"). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches. The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which Gautama Siddhartha, the historical Buddha, sat on the night he attained enlightenment. The Mesoamerican world tree connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm. The Yggdrasil, or World Ash, functions in much the same way in Norse mythology; it is the site where Odin found enlightenment. Other examples include Jievaras in Lithuanian mythology and Thor's Oak in the myths of the pre-Christian Germanic peoples. The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in Genesis present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the Paradise garden from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. Bamboo, the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The Christmas tree, which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian European beliefs, represents an axis mundi. , such as the Fly Agaric mushroom among the Evenks of Russia. In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree (). Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the \"Huainanzi\".\n\nThe human body can express the symbol of world axis. Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the \"sefirot\" in Kabbalism and in the \"chakra\" system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as yoga and tai chi begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form. Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. Astrology in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient Colossus of Rhodes combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the Vitruvian Man represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.\n\nHomes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains. The hearth participates in the symbolism of the altar and a central garden participates in the symbolism of primordial paradise. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through feng shui, a system of geomancy, just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that \"the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the \"axis mundi\". In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky.\" The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.\n\nA common shamanic concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from Odin and the World Ash Tree to the Garden of Eden and Jacob's Ladder to Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel. It is the essence of the journey described in \"The Divine Comedy\" by Dante Alighieri. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.\nIt is also a central tenet in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.\n\nAnyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a serpent, a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, mistletoe. Derivations of this idea find form in the Rod of Asclepius, an emblem of the medical profession, and in the caduceus, an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the serpents act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis mundi symbolism continues to be evoked, even in modern societies, through various art forms and has a deep rooted spiritual inspiration that transcends time.\n\nThe idea has proven consequential in the realm of architecture. Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi. A skyscraper, as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do spire structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as \"centers\" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals. The first skyscraper of modern times, the Eiffel Tower, exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in Paris, France, to serve as the centerpiece for the Exposition Universelle, making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since. Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.\n\nArtistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the \"Colonne sans fin\" (\"The Endless Column\", 1938) an abstract sculpture by Romanian Constantin Brâncuși. The column takes the form of a \"sky pillar\" () upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.\n\nVisual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn. By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point. The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image. This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energetic and shamanic.\n\nAxis mundi symbolism exists in modern space travel. Each astronaut embarks on a perilous journey into the heavens, per se, and if successful, returns with a boon for dissemination. The Apollo 13 insignia stated it succinctly: \"Ex luna scientia\" (\"From the Moon, knowledge\").\n"}

The guitar was made with unused parts from Electric XII guitars, including the body, pickups and neck, and also unused Fender Mustang bridges. The six extra holes in the headstock for the tuning machines were filled and veneered over. The Custom was featured more prominently in sales material than its companion, the Swinger, but sold poorly, and was never expected to compete with Fender's more popular models.\n\nIn 2020 Fender introduced the Maverick Dorado as a part of their Parallel Universe series.

{"id": "1831849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831849", "title": "Baltimore Museum of Art", "text": "Baltimore Museum of Art\n\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, is an art museum that was founded in 1914. The BMA's internationally renowned collection of 95,000 objects encompasses more than 1,000 works by Henri Matisse anchored by the Cone Collection of modern art, as well as one of the nation's finest holdings of prints, drawings, and photographs. The galleries currently showcase collections of art from Africa; works by established and emerging contemporary artists; European and American paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts; ancient Antioch mosaics; art from Asia, and textiles from around the world.\n\nThe museum is distinguished by a neoclassical building designed in the 1920s by renowned American architect John Russell Pope and two landscaped gardens with 20th-century sculpture. The museum is located between Charles Village, to the east, Remington, to the south, Hampden, to the west; and south of the Roland Park neighborhoods, immediately adjacent to the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, though the museum is an independent institution and not affiliated with the university.\n\nThe highlight of the museum is the Cone Collection, brought together by Baltimore sisters Claribel (1864–1929) and Etta Cone (1870–1949). Accomplished collectors, the sisters amassed a wealth of works by artists including Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Pierre-August Renoir, nearly all of which were donated to the museum. The museum is also home to 18,000 works of French mid-19th-century art from the George A. Lucas collection, which has been acclaimed by the museum as a cultural \"treasure\" and \"among the greatest single holdings of French art in the country.\"\n\nThe BMA is currently led by Director Christopher Bedford, who was appointed in May 2016, after a year-long search. Prior to joining the BMA, Bedford led the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University in Massachusetts for four years. He helped the Rose Art Museum out of the international controversy from 2009, when the university proposed selling off the museum's top-notch art collection to help with its struggling finances.\n\nIn November 2019, it was announced that the Baltimore Museum of Art will only purchase works made by female-identifying artists in 2020. The decision was made in efforts to work towards “re-correcting the canon.” To also mark the 100th anniversary of 19th amendment in 2020, all 22 exhibitions planned for the museum that year will be focused on women artists.\n\nSince October 2006, The Baltimore Museum of Art and the Walters Art Museum (formerly Walters Art Gallery), have offered free general admission year-round as a result of grants given by Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and several foundations.\n\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art is the site of Gertrude's Chesapeake Kitchen, owned and operated by chef John Shields.\n\nIn February, 1904, a major fire destroyed much of the central part of the downtown business district of the city of Baltimore. In response, the municipal government established a city-wide congress to develop a master plan for the city's recovery and future growth and development. The congress, headed by Dr. A.R.L. Dohme, decided that a major deficiency of the city was the lack of an art museum. This decision led to the formation of an 18-person Committee on the Art Museum, with art dealer and industrialist Henry H. Wiegand as chairman. Ten years later, the museum was officially incorporated on November 16, 1914. Along with Minneapolis and Cleveland, Baltimore's museum was \"modeled after two prominent 1870s predecessors, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\". According to a booklet published at the time of incorporation, it was stated that Baltimore lagged behind other cities “in regard to matters of aesthetic interest.”\n\nStill without a permanent site, the fledgling museum was founded with but a single painting, William Sergeant Kendall's \"Mischief\", which was donated by Dr. Dohme himself. As the museum's founders were confident that more art would eventually be acquired, the nearby Peabody Institute agreed to hold the collection for a time until a permanent home was established. The committee began planning a permanent home for the museum's holdings.\n\nIn 1916, a building was purchased on the southwest corner of North Charles and West Biddle Streets as a possible location for the museum. Although an architect was employed to remodel it, it was never occupied. By 1915 the group had decided to permanently house the museum in the Wyman Park area, west of the then named Peabody Heights (later Charles Village) neighborhood. By 1917, the group had received a promise from Johns Hopkins University for the land further south of the new Georgian Revival architecture-Federal styled campus they were in the process of moving to. This prospective plot was near the old Homewood Mansion of 1800 and the later Italianate style mansion of \"Wyman Villa\" of a Hopkins donor and trustee, William Wyman, which would see them leave their downtown site at North Howard Street and West Centre, which they had occupied since 1876.\n\nHowever, before finally moving into its permanent home in 1929, the museum was temporarily moved in July 1922 to the former home of their prime benefactor and foundress, Mary Elizabeth Garrett (1857–1915), at 101 West Monument Street, on the southwest corner with Cathedral Street (facing West Mount Vernon Place and the Washington Monument). Garrett, a famous philanthropist in her own right who also further endowed the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, was the only daughter of John Work Garrett (1820–1884), the Civil War-era President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, and scion of the noted Robert Garrett banking firm in the city. In 1923, the museum's inaugural exhibition opened there with attendance topping 6,775 during its first \nweek. The house was offered by Miss M. Cary as a home for the \"collections\" and a meeting place for the board of trustees. The old Garrett mansion was acquired in 1925 by the group of art enthusiasts who bought the property for the purpose of keeping the museum intact. Despite having limited space, the museum offered accommodations to art associations and a hall for meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Wyman Park, prominent architect John Russell Pope (1874–1937) was engaged to design the museum's permanent home. With his years of study in Europe, Pope is considered to be the main examplar of the classical revival style that proved so popular with traditional American architects. He is credited with a number of major buildings along the American east coast and abroad, including the National Archives Building in Washington, New York's American Museum of Natural History, and the Tate Gallery Sculpture Hall in London. His distinct brand of classicism, both serene and monolithic, was perhaps the perfect choice for such an ambitious project.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid on October 20, 1927, facing the future Art Museum Drive running diagonally from North Charles Street. The systems engineering for the building's original design was completed by Henry Adams, noted local mechanical engineer. The building consists of three floors and includes several rooms that were reconstructed and/or replicated from six local Maryland historic houses before their loss or razing.\n\nThe building phase was marked by controversy over its location, cost, and the quality of workmanship, but on April 19, 1929, it opened on schedule without much fanfare. The first visitors were greeted by Rodin's \"The Thinker\" in the Sculpture Court, and most of the objects on display were lent by Baltimore and Maryland collectors. An average of 584 visitors attended the museum each day during its first two months.\n\nBy the 1930s, the public reception was such that director Roland McKinney, in a letter to board chairman Henry Treide, noted, \"People seem to feel that the Museum belongs to them and show that they are sincerely proud of it and its activities.\" Unfortunately, these people were mostly upper-crust, privileged, and white, a fact noted in a 1937 Carnegie Corporation report. \"[Baltimore] cultural institutions (outside of the library and the schools) have appealed to, been intended for, and been supported by a pretty small minority... they need to be opened up, for the viewpoint of the entire community and its needs\", it concluded. Local artists were feeling slighted, as well. “We, the living, resent being left to work in a vacuum of indifference and neglect while so much of the dead past is exhausted [by the BMA],” the president of the Artists’ Union of Baltimore complained to \"The Evening Sun\" in 1937. The writer of the letter was Morris Louis, whose work, decades later, would be in the BMA's contemporary collection. Treide responded with an extensive community outreach survey and, in 1939, presented the city's first exhibition of African-American art. The show drew over 12,000 visitors in two weeks.\n\nMany of the objects lent to the museum when it opened were eventually donated to it. Among the donors who have shaped the museum's collection are Blanche Adler, Dr. Claribel Cone and Etta Cone, Jacob Epstein, Edward J. Gallagher, Jr., John W. and Robert Garrett, Mary Frick Jacobs, Ryda H. and Robert H. Levi, Saidie Adler May, Dorothy McIlvain Scott, Elsie C. Woodward, and Alan and Janet Wurtzburger. The growing collection is reflected in the three major expansions: the Saidie A. May Wing in 1950, the Woodward Wing in 1956, and the Cone Wing in 1957. These additions were all designed by local architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks to harmonize with the original Pope Building.\n\nToday, the BMA's collection includes more than 95,000 objects, making it the largest art museum in Maryland. It is governed by a private board of trustees and receives funding from the City of Baltimore; Baltimore County, Carroll, and Howard counties; the State of Maryland; various corporations and foundations; federal agencies; individual Trustees; and many private citizens. The BMA welcomes more than 200,000 visitors annually. In addition to its art collection, it organizes and hosts traveling exhibitions and serves as a major arts center for the region through its programs.\n\nIn 2018, the BMA announced its intention to sell seven works by artists already well-represented in the collection in order to acquire more contemporary works by women and artists of color. This initiative led to the addition of works by Mark Bradford, Isaac Julian, Wangechi Mutu, Amy Sherald, Carrie Mae Weems, Jack Whitten, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, and other notable contemporary artists. Many of these works will be on view in a major reinstallation of the Contemporary Wing that focuses on the creativity of 20th- and 21st-century black artists. In fall 2019, the BMA will also transform the East Lobby with a major new work by internationally acclaimed artist Mickalene Thomas as part of the Robert E. Meyerhoff and Rheda Becker Biennial Commission. This endowment gift is the first named public art commission in the U.S. and includes a curatorial fellowship to help strengthen the diversity of the museum.\n\nThe BMA completed a $28 million renovation (2012–2015) that improved galleries for contemporary, American, African, and Asian art collections; improved essential infrastructure, and created more visitor amenities.\n\nThe first phase of the BMA's renovation was completed in November 2012 with the reopening of the Contemporary Wing. In November 2014, after being closed for almost 30 years, the neoclassical Merrick Historic Entrance was reopened to the public to coincide with the museum's 100-year anniversary. The next phase encompassed the Dorothy McIlvain Scott American Wing, comprising the first and second floors of the BMA's original 1929 building designed by the acclaimed American architect John Russell Pope; the 1982 East Wing Lobby and Zamoiski East Entrance designed by Bower, Lewis & Thrower; and critically important upgrades to the museum's infrastructure. The architect for this phase of the renovation was the Baltimore-based architecture firm Ziger/Snead, with construction completed by Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of Towson, Maryland. The project manager was Synthesis, Inc., of Columbia, Maryland. The BMA also greatly expanded galleries for its African and Asian art collections, which opened in April 2015. The culmination of the renovation was the opening of the new $4.5 million, Patricia and Mark Joseph Education Center in October 2015.\n\nThe renovation was funded by the museum's philanthropic campaign, \"In a New Light: The Campaign for The Baltimore Museum of Art\", which raised $80.7 million and added more than 4,000 artworks to the collection during the decade leading up to the BMA's 100th anniversary.\n\nThe BMA was one of the first museums in the United States to obtain a collection of African art. A large part of the collection was donated by Janet and Alan Wurtzburger in 1954. It contains more than 2,000 objects whose sources range from ancient Egypt to contemporary Zimbabwe, and includes works from many other cultures, including Bamana, Yoruba, Kuba, Ndebele. The collection includes many different forms of art, including headdresses, masks, figures, royal staffs, textiles, jewelry, ceremonial weapons, and pottery. Several of the pieces are known for their use in royal courts, performances, and religious contexts, and many are internationally known.\n\nHighlights of the collection include works by carvers Zlan and Sonzanlwon, and figures by the legendary brasscaster Ldamie. Also on display are a Lozi throne (c. 1900) most likely carved in the court of King Lewanika of western Zambia, a 20th-century Hausa Koranic prayer board, and a 2006 video work by Theo Eshetu. At least several of the masks and figurative sculptures are recognized internationally as the best of their type.\n\nThe BMA's American art collection includes paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts spanning from the colonial era to the late 20th century. The museum has several works of art from the Baltimore area, including portraiture by Charles Willson Peale, Rembrandt Peale, and other members of the Peale family; silver from Baltimore's prominent silver manufacturing company Samuel Kirk & Son; Baltimore album quilts; and painted furniture by John Finlay and Hugh Finlay of Baltimore.\n\nThe American painting collection at the museum ranges from 18th-century portraits and 19th-century landscape painting to American Impressionism and modernism, with works by artists John Singleton Copley, Thomas Sully, Thomas Eakins, John Singer Sargent, Childe Hassam, and Thomas Hart Benton. Notable canvases include \"A Wild Scene\" (1831–1832) by Thomas Cole, \"La Vachère\" (1888) by Theodore Robinson, and \"Pink Tulip\" (1926) by Georgia O'Keeffe. These are complemented by holdings of prints and drawings, as well as modern photographs from the Gallagher/Dalsheimer Collection. Artists represented include Imogen Cunningham, Man Ray, Paul Strand, and Alfred Stieglitz.\n\nThe BMA has a long record of collecting works by African American artists that began in 1939 with one of the first exhibitions of African American art in the country. This collection has grown with the addition of works by 19th- and 20th-century African-American artists Joshua Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Edmonia Lewis, Horace Pippin, and Henry Ossawa Tanner, as well as numerous works by contemporary artists.\n\nThe BMA's holdings of American decorative arts include an extensive furniture collection that represents the major historic cabinetmaking centers of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Many of these objects came from Dorothy McIlvain Scott, a generous Baltimore philanthropist and collector.\n\nA gift in 1933 by Mrs. Miles White, Jr. of over 200 pieces of Maryland silver formed the nucleus of a silver collection that now encompasses objects by leading 18th- and early 19th-century silversmiths in Annapolis and Baltimore, as well as examples of early English silver owned by Maryland families during the Federal era. Among them is the Annapolis Subscription Plate, made by Annapolis silver smith John Inch and the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland. Later masterworks by artists from Louis Comfort Tiffany to Georg Jensen are also on view.\n\nOther notable aspects of the decorative arts collection include a rare set of five clerestory windows and two mosaic-clad architectural columns that represent Tiffany's contribution to 20th-century ornament. Period rooms from six historic Maryland houses, along with architectural elements from other historic buildings, illustrate town and country building styles from the 18th and 19th centuries, and miniature rooms made by Chicago miniaturist Eugene Kupjack that invite scrutiny of a variety of decorative styles at close range.\n\nThe BMA exhibits a collection of Antioch mosaics, the result of its participation in excavations of this ancient city, known today as Antakya in southeastern Turkey, near the border of Syria.\n\nWith the support of BMA Trustee Robert Garrett, the Baltimore Museum of Art joined the Musées Nationaux de France, Worcester Art Museum, and Princeton University during the excavations of 1932 to 1939, discovering 300 mosaic pavements in and around the lost city. The BMA received some of the mosaics from the excavation, totaling 34 pavements, 28 of which are on display in the museum's sunlit atrium court.\n\nDiscovered in the affluent suburb of Daphne and the nearby port city of Seleucia Pieria, the mosaics date from the days of the emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century A.D. to the Christian empire of Justinian in the 6th century, bridging the Classical world and the early Middle Ages. The mosaics illustrate how the classical art of Greece and Rome evolved into the art of the early Christian era, and tell the story of how people lived in this ancient city prior to its destruction by catastrophic earthquakes in 526 and 528 A.D. The mosaics are notable for their grand scale and elaborately patterned borders, and the brilliance of their decorative and naturalistic effects.\n\nThis collection contains works from 59 distinct artistic traditions from Aztec and Maya of Mesoamerica, Chimú and Muisca of Andean South America, and Nicoya and Atlantic Watershed of Costa Rica. The collection includes works from 2500 BC to AD 1521. The core collection of 120 objects was given to the museum by Alan Wurtzburger in 1958, which significantly expanded the scope of the existing collection and provided momentum for a traveling exhibition of Peruvian ceramics titled \"Myths of Ancient Peru\" (1969).\n\nThe collection is particularly admired for its West Mexico ceramics, including an important Nayarit house model and an enthroned chief. Also on display is a unique assemblage of 23 figures in dance regalia which celebrates ancient performance and highlights the diversity of Colima art.\n\nOther notable pieces include a finely worked serpentine figure of Olmec mastery, elegant portrayals of Maya and Aztec noblewomen showcasing the integral roles women played in the social, political, economic, and spiritual realms of society, and miniature gold votives in the Muisca tradition.\n\nThis exhibit includes artwork from several cultural traditions of the Pacific Islands, including Melanesia and Polynesia. Works in collection include jewelry, ornaments, and tapa cloths.\n\nOf notable interest is a finely carved lizard of dark wood and shell from Easter Island; a battle pectoral created from hundreds of Nassa shells, which highlights Middi art of New Britain; and an 18th-century royal Hawaiian necklace.\n\nOther highlights of the collection include a breast ornament embellished with small birds and stars that figured as insignia of prestige for the Tonga of the Fiji Islands. Featuring whale ivory and pearl shell design, it is recognized as one of the largest of its kind.\n\nThe museum's Asian art collection includes works from China, Japan, India, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and the Near East. The collection is particularly known for its Chinese ceramics, with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) and utilitarian stoneware from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Although more than 1,000 objects are comprised in this collection, because of limited space, only a portion of the pieces are on display at one time. Works are on view in rotating installations in the museum's Julius Levy Memorial Gallery.\n\nSome notable works in the collection include the life-sized early-15th-century bronze Guanyin, known widely as \"Goddess of Mercy\"; the robust figure of a horse from a Han dynasty tomb; a 39-piece mortuary retinue, a rare example of the quantities of clay figures that were placed in tombs during the early Tang dynasty; and an outstanding foliate-shaped brush washer that represents the mastery of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Asian art is also represented in other areas of the museum's collection, including 475 Japanese prints and 1,000 textiles from across Asia.\n\nThe European art collection at the BMA contains works from the 15th through 19th centuries. Most of the collection was formed through donations made by private citizens of the city of Baltimore, notably Mary Frick Jacobs, George A. Lucas, and Jacob Epstein. The collection contains a large selection of 19th-century French art, including more than 140 bronze animal sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye and several paintings by Barbizon artists such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and impressionist Camille Pissarro.\n\nThe collection includes a wide array of decorative arts, including jeweled snuff boxes, porcelain, and silver. The museum also exhibits a large collection of works on paper from the 15th through the 19th century.\n\nHighlights of the European art exhibit include Sir Anthony van Dyck's \"Rinaldo and Armida\" (1629), which was commissioned by King Charles I of England. It is considered one of the artist's finest paintings. Other items of northern European and French art include Frans Hals' portrait \"Dorothea Berck\" (1644), Rembrandt van Rijn's painting of his son \"Titus\" (1660), Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin’s portrayal of a lovely maiden tossing a ball in \"The Game of Knucklebones\" (c. 1734), and French court portraitist Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun's exotic \"Princess Anna Alexandrovna Galitzin\" (c. 1797). Medieval and Renaissance works include a 14th-century \"Burgundian Virgin and Child\" carved of limestone and Titian's \"Portrait of a Gentleman\" (1561). There are also late-medieval and Renaissance paintings by Giovanni dal Ponte, Biagio D'Antonio, Sandro Botticelli and Workshop, Bernardino Luini, Francesco Ubertini, and Master of View of Saint Gudule.\n\nIn 2012, \"Paysage Bords de Seine\", a Renoir stolen from the museum, resurfaced after being lost for 63 years. The painting then became the subject of a dramatic legal dispute involving the FBI, the woman who said she found the painting, an insurance company's rights to the artwork, and the intentions of Saidie May, an art collector who bought the painting in Paris in 1925 and lent it to the Baltimore museum. In 2014, a judge deemed it to be the property of the BMA after reviewing related documentation from its archives. At the time of the theft, Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. paid the museum about $2,500 for the loss. The company considered whether to make a claim for the painting when it resurfaced, but decided it \"belonged\" at the museum.\n\nBaltimore sisters Claribel and Etta Cone amassed one of the most important collections of modern art in the U.S. and gave it to the BMA in 1949. Etta Cone began the Cone Collection in 1898 with the purchase of five paintings by American Impressionist Theodore Robinson to decorate their Baltimore home. Soon after, the sisters began to make annual trips to Paris where they visited museums, salons, and the studios of emerging artists. In 1906, Etta purchased her first work by Henri Matisse during a visit with the artist arranged by Gertrude Stein’s sister-in-law, Sarah Stein. The Cone sisters were among the artist's first patrons and Etta, in particular, collected works throughout his entire career. Their collection of approximately 3,000 objects included 500 works by Matisse, as well as masterworks by Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Cézanne, which were displayed in their Baltimore apartments prior to coming to the museum.\n\nThe BMA's Contemporary Wing was built and opened in 1994, closed in January 2011 for renovations, and reopened in November 2012 with new wall and floor finishes; a gallery dedicated to light, sound, and moving image-based art; a dedicated gallery for prints, drawings and photographs; and BMA Go Mobile, a mobile website guide.\n\nThe renovated wing houses a two-part architectural intervention that made the BMA the first museum in the United States to commission and acquire a site-specific installation by artist Sarah Oppenheimer. The collection features works by Olafur Eliasson, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Franz West, Yayoi Kusama, Donald Judd, and other eminent artists alongside new acquisitions from 21st-century artists such as Guyton \\ Walker, Josephine Meckseper, Sarah Sze, and Rirkrit Tiravanija. The works of American artist Bruce Nauman, known for his work with neon lights, can be seen both in the contemporary collection and adorning the outside of the museum itself with his piece \"Violins, Violence, Silence\". The BMA has the second largest collection of Andy Warhol's late work in the U.S.\n\nThe Contemporary Wing will be reinstalled again in summer 2019 with a new presentation of 20th- and 21st-century art that focuses on the creativity of black artists such as Roy DeCarava, David Driskell, Joyce J. Scott, Lorna Simpson, and Jack Whitten.\n\n\n\n"}

It and its wholly owned subsidiary Threecaf Brands Canada, Inc., are franchisers and operators of Bruegger's bakery-cafés, and Michel's Baguette.\n\nThey produce approximately 70 million bagels each year, and they hold the Guinness World Record for producing the world's largest bagel. The company also purveys foods such as breads, soups, sandwiches, coffee and specialty drinks. Bruegger's operates approximately 300 restaurants in 26 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Canada.\n\nBruegger's was founded in 1983 by Nordahl Brue and Mike Dressell, with the first store opening in Troy, New York.\n\nThe business was bought by Quality Dining (a franchisee) in June 1996 for $142 million in stock, with the founders joining the Quality Dining board. The merge was not a comfortable one; within a short period Brue and Dressell became concerned with the ongoing operations and scope for growth, leading to a critical U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing alleging a lack of strategic direction. Holding a combined 26% stake, Brue and Dressell called for reorganization of Quality Dining, resulting in Bruegger's being resold to Brue and Dressel in October 1997 for $45 million. Brue has since referred to the original sale as part of his \"biggest mistake\".\n\nIn May 2003, James J. Greco and Sun Capital Partners acquired the company from the founders.\n\nToday, approximately 260 Bruegger's locations operate in 26 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Bruegger's announced $200 million in revenue in 2008.\n\nOn November 13, 2009, Bruegger's purchased the retail operations of Timothy's World Coffee, mmmuffins, and Michel's Baguette through a wholly owned subsidiary called ThreeCaf Brands Canada, Inc. Bruegger's intends to continue operations of all three brands. The three brands combined operated approximately 140 locations.\n\nOn March 17, 2011, Groupe Le Duff of France announced the buyout of Bruegger's. Le Duff already has a U.S. presence with its La Madeleine brand, which has 60 units domestically. Le Duff plans to \"Francify\" some Bruegger's locations and will combine other units with Brioche Dorée outlets. The first European Bruegger's opened in Rennes in 2013 (Paris and Toulouse in 2015).\n\nIn December 2011, James J. Greco announced he would be stepping down as CEO at the end of the year to pursue other opportunities.\n\nOn August 24, 2017 it was announced that Bruegger's owner Le Duff America announced that Caribou and its privately held owner JAB Holdings had agreed to buy the bagel chain. The terms of the deal, which closed at the end of September, were not disclosed. In December 2017 Bruegger's closed 30 locations, primarily in Eastern markets. \n\nIn April 2018, Threecaf Brands sold Timothy's World Coffee and mmmuffins to Canadian company MTY Food Group of Richmond Hill, Ontario for $1.7 million, of which $1.2 million was in cash, $0.2 million in assumed liabilities, and $0.3 million as a holdback.\n\nMichel's Bakery Café, formerly named Michel's Baugettes, is a Canadian bakery-café founded in 1980, operating restaurants throughout Canada. The company is one of the largest bakery-café chains in Canada and operates both corporate and franchise locations. The company was purchased by Timothy's Coffees of the World Inc. in 2001. Timothy's continued to operate the Michel's Bakery Café stores under their original trade name, Michel's Baguette. On November 13, 2009, Michel's Baguette was sold to Bruegger's Enterprises, Inc. along with Timothy's Coffee and mmmuffins through a wholly owned subsidiary called ThreeCaf Brands Canada Inc. Bruegger's has continued to operate these chains. The company has since revitalized its operations, revamped its aesthetics and changed its name to Michel's Bakery Café.\n\nOn August 27, 2004, Bruegger's created the world's largest bagel, which currently holds the Guinness World Record. The bagel weighed and required of dough, of water, and 10 hours of baking. It was cooked at the New York State Fair and was sliced and served to onlookers, who were encouraged to make donations to benefit local food banks.\n\n"}

It was established as a village in 1924 at the consolidation of the villages of Fairview and North Pocatello which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in 1911 and 1914 respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later U.S. Route 91), one of Idaho's first designated highways. By 1930, the village exceeded its predecessor villages' 1920 population by 144%. In just under forty years of history, the village became Idaho's eleventh most populous city.\n\nIt was consolidated with Pocatello in 1962, with the support of its mayor, George Hansen, who later served seven terms as a congressman. Another nearby city, Chubbuck, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality.\n\nAmong its other businesses, Alameda had four pharmacies: Grand Central Pharmacy (300 block of Jefferson), Poleline Drug (Poleline Road), Alameda Pharmacy (375 Yellowstone) and Hiway Drug (320 Yellowstone).\n\nIn the 1960 census, Alameda had a population of 10,660 and Pocatello was at 28,534; the consolidation made Pocatello the state's largest city based on those numbers, passing Boise and Idaho Falls.\n\n\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Alameda has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfb\" on climate maps.\n"}

This was thought to be a good place for business. There were two warehouses, a store, and a hotel there in 1827, set up by Nathaniel Hardy. \n\nBotzum was platted in 1836 on 100 acres (0.4 km²) as Niles by Peter Voris and some of his associates. The village was never actually built, though, due to the Panic of 1837. Eventually the lots were sold off, one of them to George Botzum. In 1866 the Buckeye post office opened up. In spite of this name, though, the railroad depot in town was called Botzum. The name of the post office was also changed to Botzum in 1893 to match the name of the depot.\n\nIn the 1920s the city of Akron purchased 800 acres (3.2 km²) of land at Botzum to build a sewage treatment plant, which opened in 1928 and remains there to this day. There is no longer any sign that there was a community there. Along with the sewage plant it is known for a viewing station for great blue herons to the east where Bath Road crosses the Cuyahoga River.

{"id": "1831878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831878", "title": "Tin Machine", "text": "Tin Machine\n\nTin Machine were a British-American hard rock supergroup formed in 1988, notable for being fronted by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. The band consisted of Bowie on lead vocals, sax, and guitar; Reeves Gabrels on guitar and vocals; Tony Fox Sales on bass and vocals; and Hunt Sales on drums and vocals. Tony and Hunt are the sons of American comedian Soupy Sales. Additional musicians who performed with the band on tour or in the studio, but were not members of the band itself included English guitarist Kevin Armstrong, who played on the band's first studio album and first tour, and American guitarist Eric Schermerhorn who played on the second tour and live album \"\" (1992).\n\nDrummer Hunt Sales said that the band's name \"reflects the sound of the band,\" and Bowie stated that he and his band members joined up \"to make the kind of music that we enjoyed listening to\" and to rejuvenate himself artistically.\n\nThe band recorded two studio albums and one live album before dissolving in 1992, after which Bowie returned to his solo career. By the end of 2012, they had reportedly sold two million albums. Bowie would later credit his time with Tin Machine as instrumental in revitalising his career after the 1980s.\n\nThe album \"Never Let Me Down\" (1987) and subsequent Glass Spider Tour had left critics unimpressed, and Bowie was aware of his low standing. Eager to return to making music for himself rather than the mainstream audience he had acquired following the \"Let's Dance\" album, Bowie began collaborating with Reeves Gabrels, who pushed the singer to rediscover his experimental side.\n\nBowie and Gabrels had initially met through Gabrels' then-wife Sara Terry, who was part of the press staff for the North American leg of Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider world tour. The two men had struck up a friendship when Gabrels visited at several tour venues. Notably, their relationship began as a social one, as Gabrels didn't mention that he himself was a musician. Common interests in popular culture and the visual arts provided more than enough to talk about, Gabrels explained in later interviews, and also because he was in his wife's workplace, he felt it wasn't appropriate to bring up his own music. At the tour's end, Bowie kindly asked Terry if he could do anything for her. In response, Terry gave Bowie a tape of Gabrels' guitar playing. Months later, after listening to the tape, Bowie phoned Gabrels to invite him to get together to play and write. Bowie told him that he felt he had \"lost his vision\" and was looking for ways to get it back. After a month working together, Gabrels asked Bowie what he wanted of him, and, according to Gabrels, Bowie said \"Basically, I need somebody that can do a combination of Beck, Hendrix, Belew and Fripp, with a little Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King thrown in. Then, when I’m not singing, you take the ball and do something with it, and when you hand the ball back to me, it might not even be the same ball.\"\n\nThe first public fruits of Bowie and Gabrels working together came with a new arrangement by Gabrels of the song \"Look Back in Anger\" which Bowie had written with Brian Eno in 1979 for the album \"Lodger\". The occasion was a benefit show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) on 1 July 1988 at which Bowie had been invited to perform with the avant-garde dance troupe La La La Human Steps. Bowie sang, played and danced with troupe members while in lighted grottoes upstage three musicians (Gabrels on guitar, Kevin Armstrong on guitar, and Erdal Kızılçay on bass) played the new minute score that Gabrels created from the 3-minute song; the new material included drums programmed by Kızılçay. \"We went into the studio to rearrange it,\" said Bowie in a filmed interview; \"I like the hard-edged wall of guitar sound that we put into it.\"\n\nGabrels recalled that early on, they weren't sure who they'd work with. They discussed working with Terry Bozzio on drums and Percy Jones on bass. But Bowie, who had run into Tony Sales in Los Angeles at a wrap party for his Glass Spider Tour, convinced Tony to call his brother Hunt so they could work together again, as Tony and Hunt had performed with David Bowie in support of Iggy Pop in the late 1970s. Tony recalled that Bowie was \"thinking about getting a band together — \"something\" together. He didn't know exactly what he wanted to do, but he wanted Hunt and I to meet Reeves and maybe we could all write together, come up with something.\"\n\nBowie himself was surprised with how things came together with the band, saying, \"I'd never wanted to be in a band until we got together. And as we were getting together, it wasn't really occurring to me that this is what I wanted to do. It took a week or so of actually being in the studio and working, and then I think we fully realized the potential, musically, for what we were doing and wanted to stick with it. I was quite happy to go off and make a solo album. I was quite excited about a couple of things I was doing, which I brought into the band and which were irrevocably changed. But that's the nature of the band.\"\n\nBowie was pleased that the band members clicked, calling the ease at which the personalities came together \"inspired guesswork\". Hunt and Tony, the two sons of comic Soupy Sales, kept the mood jovial during recording sessions and interviews. Bowie later rejected the idea that Reeves, Hunt and Tony were backing members of his band. \"The Sales brothers would never accept having another boss. They are far too stubborn and aware of their own needs. They're not in the market to be anybody's backing band, either of them. You do not fuck with the Sales brothers, or Reeves Gabrels.\" Gabrels said that Bowie came in one day while the group was first forming and said, \"I think this has got to be a band. Everybody's got input. Everybody's writing. You guys don't listen to me anyway.\" The band split profits four ways, no one was on a salary and each member paid for his own expenses. Bowie also clarified that \"the band will cease to exist the moment it ceases to be a musical experience for any of us. None of us wanted to get into the kind of situation where you find yourself making albums because you're contracted to.\" The group set up allowed Bowie a certain level of anonymity, and to that end Bowie stipulated that all four members divide interviews equally between them and that in the cases where he was interviewed, that another member of the band be present as well. He made a point to clarify that he didn't invite the others to join \"his\" band, rather, \"the band literally came together.\" \n\nThe Sales brothers moved the tone of the sessions away from art-rock and more towards hard rock, and Bowie looked to one of his favorite bands at the time, the Pixies, for inspiration. The Sales brothers heckled Bowie into greater spontaneity, with most songs recorded in one take, and lyrics left unpolished, thus giving the band a ragged, punk rock edge.\n\nIn contemporary interviews, the band claimed their musical influences were Gene Krupa, Charlie Mingus, Jimi Hendrix, Glenn Branca, Mountain, Cream, and the Jeff Beck Group.\n\nAccording to Bowie, the group decided when they formed that they'd play from album to album, and that \"if we were still getting on with each other — which was the priority — that we'd continue.\"\n\nThe group chose the name Tin Machine after one of the songs they had written. Tony Sales joked that, as all four members were divorced when the band formed, originally the band was going to be called \"The Four Divorcés\" or \"Alimony Inc.\" Gabrels suggested calling the band \"White Noise\", but Bowie dismissed it as too \"racist\". \"Leather Weasel\" was \"considered and quickly discarded.\" Gabrels later elaborated on the real name choice, saying the band's name \"worked on a number of levels for us. The archaic — the idea of tin, which is still everywhere: tin cans, when you go to the supermarket; when you walk down the street you find rusting tin. It's such a supposedly archaic material, but it's everywhere. Sort of like the idea of us playing this music and not using drum machines and sequencers and things like that. There's a point at which it connects. At least for us. And the final thing, for lack of a better name.\"\n\nThe band's self-titled first album was recorded in late 1988 and early 1989. It produced mixed but generally positive reviews upon release in May 1989, picking up favourable comparisons with Bowie's two more recent solo albums. Commercially, the album initially sold well, reaching No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart, but sales quickly tailed off. Gabrels claimed in 1991 that album sales from the first album were \"ten times better\" than he had anticipated. At the time of the release of the album, Bowie was enthusiastic about the band and the work they'd done, and felt that band had in them \"another two albums at least.\"\n\nContrary to common reports, the band's first live performance together wasn't at the International Rock Awards Show on 31 May 1989. Prior to that show, the band played an unannounced show in Nassau. Bowie recalled \"We showed up at a club in Nassau where we were recording and did four or five songs. We went down to the club and just did 'em.\" Added Gabrels, \"We just walked up on stage and you could hear all these voices whispering, 'That's David Bowie! No, it can't be David Bowie, he's got a beard!'\"\n\nThe band recognized that some fans and critics didn't like Bowie's new role in the band. Said Tony Sales, \"Mainly, people are pissed off because David's not doing 'David Bowie.'\" Bowie confirmed that Tin Machine live shows would be \"non-theatrical\" in contrast to his most recent tour.\n\nThe band undertook a low-key tour in small venues between 14 June and 3 July 1989, before further recording sessions in Sydney, Australia. During these sessions Tin Machine contributed to a surfing compilation album, \"Beyond the Beach\", with a new instrumental song titled \"Needles on the Beach\". A partial recording of their show from this tour recorded at La Cigale in Paris on 25 June 1989 was released digitally in August 2019.\n\nThe group then went on hiatus while Bowie conducted his solo Sound+Vision Tour. In December 1990, Bowie split from EMI. Hunt Sales said that EMI \"kind of freaked out a little bit at the strident, single-less Tin Machine debut\", which partially explained why Bowie switched music labels. In March 1991, the band signed to Victory Music, a new label launched by JVC and distributed worldwide by London Records and Polygram, and recorded more new material. This was combined with tracks from the Sydney sessions to form the \"Tin Machine II\" album. The album was described as \"just as impure and twisted [as their first album], but more R&B and less abrasive.\" Gabrels explained the change between the first and second album was because by the second album, \"we knew one another as musicians. ... It wasn't as dense. And we actually left more room, I think for David to come up with some interesting melodies. There was more room for vocals on this record.\"\n\nIn late 1991 Bowie reiterated that he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating \"I'm content. … I'm deriving a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine\", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying \"we're doing exactly what we wanted to do.\" During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels played his guitar with a vibrator and for a performance on BBC's Top of the Pops, who banned the use of the vibrator, he mimed playing his guitar with a chocolate éclair.\n\nFrom 5 October 1991 to 17 February 1992, the group undertook a larger tour, known as the It's My Life Tour. The band was joined on this tour by guitarist Eric Schermerhorn. On 23 November 1991, the band was the musical guest during Saturday Night Live's 17th season.\n\nTracks from the \"It's My Life\" tour were released on the July 1992 album \"\". The album did not sell well and there was speculation that the failure of this album to achieve commercial success was among the reasons that the band ultimately broke up. As early as 1990, Bowie knew he'd be going back to solo work, although not because he disliked working with the band. He said \"I have very definite ideas of what I want to do as a solo artist, which I'll be starting on probably late next year [1991], again completely different, hopefully, from what I've done before.\" Shortly after the release of \"Oy Vey, Baby\", Bowie returned to solo recording with his single \"Real Cool World\", but he maintained intentions to return to the studio with Tin Machine in 1993 for a third album. These plans would fail to come to fruition, however, and the band shortly thereafter dissolved. There were allegations that Hunt Sales' growing drug addiction were responsible for the band's end, but of Tin Machine's dissolution, Bowie merely said \"personal problems within the band became the reason for its demise. It’s not for me to talk about them, but it became physically impossible for us to carry on. And that was pretty sad really.\"\n\nThe band earned mixed reviews during their short career. In later years, critics have reappraised the band more warmly and Tin Machine have been found \"unjustly\" harshly reviewed. One critic suggested that part of the reason for its poor reception was that Tin Machine's music was somewhat ahead of its time, and that the band \"explored alternative and grunge before the styles were even widely known to exist.\" Another critic agreed, with yet another suggesting that Tin Machine and Bowie were \"merely ahead of the curve. A prophet, a voice in the desert predicting the coming of Nirvana. At the time, Nirvana was toiling in Seattle obscurity, pushing its debut \"Bleach\" on Sub Pop at every dive it played.\" Tim Palmer, after producing Tin Machine's two studio albums, would go on to mix Pearl Jam's grunge album \"Ten\" in 1991, and later recalled to Gabrels that he had come into the studio one day to find Pearl Jam listening to Tin Machine's \"Heaven's in Here\".\n\nIn 1996, Bowie reflected on his time with Tin Machine: \"For better or worse it helped me to pin down what I did and didn’t enjoy about being an artist. It helped me, I feel, to recover as an artist. And I do feel that for the past few years I’ve been absolutely in charge of my artistic path again. I’m working to my own criteria. I’m not doing anything I would feel ashamed of in the future, or that I would look back on and say my heart wasn’t in that.\"\n\nIn 1997, when asked if he thought the band was still underrated, Bowie said, \"It's going to be interesting, isn't it? As the songs creep out in different forms over the years, I assume that eventually it'll be evaluated in a different way. I'm not sure people will ever be sympathetic to it entirely. But as the years go by, I think they'll be less hostile. I think it was quite a brave band and I think there were some extremely good pieces of work done. And I think they'll kind of show themselves over time.\"\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Bowie looked back at his time with the band as invaluable, saying \"I had to kick-start my engine again in music. There’d been a wobbly moment where I could quite easily have gone reclusive and just worked on visual stuff, paint and sculpt and all that. I had made a lot of money: I thought, well, I could just bugger off and do my Gauguin in Tahiti bit now. But then what do you do — re-emerge at 60 somewhere? So I look back on the Tin Machine years with great fondness. They charged me up. I can’t tell you how much.\"\n\nDespite some reports that Bowie was unhappy working in the band, Bowie stated several times over his years with Tin Machine that he was happy working in the band. Bowie used his time with the band as a way to revitalize himself and his career, which he would later in March 1997 call a \"lifeline\", citing Reeves Gabrels as a source of his new-found energy and direction:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It may be considered part of the New Testament apocryphal tradition. The Naassenes (from Hebrew \"na'asch\", snake) were a Gnostic Ophite sect. The fragmentary quotation is given by Hippolytus as expressing the fundamental ideas of the Naassene Ophites, and possibly of all Gnostics.\n\nTranslation by G.R.S. Mead:\nFirst [was there] Mind the Generative Law of All;\nSecond to the Firstborn was Liquid Chaos; \nThird Soul through toil received the Law. \nWherefore, with a deer's form surrounding her, \nShe labours at her task beneath Death's rule. \nNow, holding sway, she sees the Light; \nAnd now, cast into piteous plight, she weeps; \nNow she weeps, and now rejoices; \nNow she weeps, and now is judged; \nNow is judged, and now she dieth; \nNow is born, with no way out for her; in misery \nShe enters in her wandering the labyrinth of ills. And Jesus said: O Father, see! [Behold] the struggle still of ills on earth!\nFar from Thy Breath away she wanders!\nShe seeks to flee the bitter Chaos,\nAnd knows not how she shall pass through.\nWherefore, send me, O Father!\nSeals in my hands, I will descend;\nThrough Æons universal will I make a Path;\nThrough Mysteries all I'll open up a Way!\nAnd Forms of Gods will I display;\nThe secrets of the Holy Path I will hand on,\nAnd call them \"Gnosis.\"\n\nThe following is Adolf von Harnack's paraphrase (\"SBA\", 1902, pp. 542 sqq.):\n\nThe generating principle of the universe, the first in order, was 'reason'; but the second principle was the firstbom's emitted 'chaos'; and the third principle was received by the soul, which descends from both. Therefore, fashioned like a trembling deer, the soul wrests herself free from the grip of death (strengthening itself by such exertions). Now she wins the mastery and sees the light; now plunged into wo, she weeps; again, in the depths of evil, the unhappy one becomes ensnared in a maze. Then spake Jesus: \"behold, O Father! this being, pursued by ills, roams astray upon earth, far from thy breath. It seeks to escape bitter chaos, and knows not whither to find escape. Therefore, send me, O Father, with the seals in my hand will I descend: all eons will I traverse, all mysteries reveal, and show the forms of the gods. I will deliver the secret of the holy way, and call it Gnosis.\"\n\nHere, reason and chaos, the intelligent and the material world, stand opposed; and between them is the human soul, belonging to both spheres, yet striving toward the higher and the spiritual. The soul is unable to ascend by its own power; therefore, a heavenly being, concordant with the will of the supreme principle, descends into the human world and redeems the soul by showing it the way through the spheres which sunder it from the world divine. It is not mere thirst for knowledge that impels the Gnostics, but essentially a concern of salvation; because the Gnostic's salvation depends on the possession of the \"Gnosis\" respecting these things.\n\nLike Gnosis at large, the Ophites teach the existence of a Supreme Being, standing infinitely high above the visible world; qualified as purely spiritual, the primal basis of all things, the starting-point of the cosmic process. His names are, Father of the Universe, First Man, the \"Uncreated,\" the \"Unspeakable,\" the \"Unapproachable God.\" He is self-evolving, and thus becomes the source of all being. The first products of this spontaneous evolution still belong to the purely spiritual spheres. The Ophitic theology tends to separate this supreme God into an ever-increasing number of separate entities. In the aforesaid Hymn, only the Son is mentioned beside the Father; but a tetrad occurs among the Ophites of Irenaeus and the Naassenes; an entire decad among the \"Gnostici Barbelo\"; while the Nag Hammadi writings disclose a countless host of higher beings. The Supreme Being's mode of evolution is set forth, now as a generative, again as a psychologic process; and frequently the two ideas are combined. Some pagan mythology lies obviously at the root of the matter; which accounts also for their syzygial views; for, in part at least, the Ophites aimed to interpret the ancient myths as psychologic processes. Over against the Supreme Being stands chaos, the material principle. Yet there is not here a sharp dualism. In the Hymn, the phrase \"the firstborn's emitted chaos\" implies that it is derived from a higher being. In only very few instances is chaos an evil power, an active principle. It is not the existence of chaos which contradicts perfection; but rather the mixture of luminous parts with material elements. This mixture, in a word, is the great calamity, the loss that must be retrieved through redemption. How did this mixture come to pass? The Hymn designates the soul, the principle of this compound, as the common product of mind and chaos. Such is also the theory of the Perates and Sethians, mentioned by Hippolytus. These sects most nearly approach the dualistic scheme, yet the latter is not distinctly defined. In Justin, also, dualism is diminished.\n\n"}

It is considered to be the only Stradivarius in existence in \"as new\" state. It is in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England.\n\nThe violin, known as the \"Messiah\" (\"Messie\" in French), remained in Stradivari's workshop until his death in 1737. It was then sold by his son Paolo to Count Cozio di Salabue in 1775, and for a time, the violin bore the name \"Salabue\". The instrument was then purchased by Luigi Tarisio in 1827. Upon Tarisio’s death, in 1854, the French luthier Jean Baptiste Vuillaume of Paris purchased The \"Messiah\" along with Tarisio's entire collection. \"One day Tarisio was discoursing with Vuillaume on the merits of this unknown and marvelous instrument, when the violinist Jean-Delphin Alard, Vuillaume's son-in-law, exclaimed: 'Really, Mister Tarisio, your violin is like the Messiah of the Jews: one always expects him but he never appears' ('Vraiment, Monsieur Tarisio, votre violon est comme le Messie des Juifs: on l'attend toujours, mais il ne paraît jamais' ). Thus the violin was baptized with the name by which it is still known.\"\n\nThe \"Messiah\" was bequeathed by the family of W.E. Hill to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford for preservation as \"a yardstick for future violin makers to learn from\".\n\nThe violin is in like-new condition, as it was seldom played. The tonal potential of the instrument has been questioned due to the conditions of the Hill bequest. However it was played by the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, who stated in a letter of 1891 to the then owner of the \"Messiah\", Robert Crawford, that he was struck by the combined sweetness and grandeur of the sound. Nathan Milstein played it at the Hills' shop before 1940 and described it as an unforgettable experience. It is one of the most valuable of all the Stradivari instruments.\n\nThe top of the \"Messiah\" is made from the same tree as a P.G. Rogeri violin of 1710. The tuning pegs and the tailpiece (that shows the Nativity of Christ) are not original, but were added by Vuillaume.\n\n\n"}

He served from January 1981 until his resignation in April 1982.\n\nIn the 1980 general election, Martin, who then listed his occupation as a carpenter, unseated Democratic State Representative James E. Mankins, who was considered a prime possibility to become Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. In the 1981 House session, Martin offered one bill, which never came to a vote, a proposal to require the teaching of creationism along with the theory of evolution in public school science classes. He was named as one of the \"Ten Worst Legislators\" by \"Texas Monthly\" magazine.\n\nMartin became a police officer in 1971. He served in the Air Force from 1975 through 1979.\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Martin was living in a recreational vehicle at a mobile home park in east Austin. Four shotgun blasts were fired at his vehicle on the night of July 31, and three struck Martin in his left arm. At first he attributed the shooting to a Satanic cult that he had reportedly been investigating. \n\nThereafter, Charles Goff, a cousin of Martin's, said that he had fired the shots at Martin's behest to gain political sympathy for the young lawmaker who was contemplating a run for the Texas State Senate in 1982. Goff also said that Martin had offered him a high-paying state job. Martin fled, but Texas Rangers eventually apprehended Martin at his mother's farmhouse just outside Longview, where he was found hiding in a stereo cabinet. \n\nMartin was charged with perjury by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle and subsequently resigned from the state House after a protracted legal fight.

{"id": "1831939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1831939", "title": "Persian Corridor", "text": "Persian Corridor\n\nThe Persian Corridor was a supply route through Iran into Soviet Azerbaijan by which British aid and American Lend-Lease supplies were transferred to the Soviet Union during World War II. Of the 17.5 million long tons of U.S. Lend-Lease aid provided to Russia, 7.9 million long tons (45%) were sent through Iran.\n\nThis supply route originated in the US and UK with ships sailing around the Cape of Good Hope to the Persian Gulf. From there, the materiel transited Iran to the USSR. Other supply routes included the Northern route across the Arctic, and the Pacific route which handled US cargo at Vladivostok and then used the Trans-Siberian Railway across the USSR.\n\nThis Persian Route became the only viable, all-weather route to be developed to supply Soviet needs.\n\nEnglish-language official documents from the Persian Corridor period continue to make the word \"Persia\" interchangeable with the name of Iran. In correspondence by the government of the United Kingdom, usage of \"Persia\" over \"Iran\" was chosen by Winston Churchill to avoid possible confusion with neighbouring Iraq.\n\nFollowing Germany's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union became allies. Britain and the USSR saw the newly opened Trans-Iranian Railway as an attractive route to transport supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. Britain and the USSR used concessions extracted in previous interventions to pressure Iran (and, in Britain's case, Iraq) into allowing the use of their territory for military and logistical purposes. Increased tensions with Britain led to pro-German rallies in Tehran. In August 1941, because Reza Shah refused to expel all German nationals and come down clearly on the Allied side, Britain and the USSR invaded Iran, arrested the monarch and sent him into exile to South Africa, taking control of Iran's communications and the coveted railway.\n\nIn 1942 the United States, now an ally of Britain and the USSR in World War II, sent a military force to Iran to help maintain and operate sections of the railway. The British and Soviet authorities allowed Reza Shah's system of government to collapse, and they limited the constitutional government interfaces. They installed Reza Shah's son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi onto the Iranian/Persian throne.\n\nThe new Shah soon signed an agreement pledging full non-military logistical cooperation with the British and Soviets, in exchange for full recognition of his country's independence, and also a promise to withdraw from Iran within six months of the war's conclusion (these assurances later proved essential in securing his country's independence after the war). In September 1943, the Shah went further, and he declared war on Germany. He signed the Declaration by United Nations entitling his country to a seat in the original United Nations. Two months later, he hosted the Tehran Conference between Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.\n\nThe presence of so many foreign troops in Iran accelerated social change and it roused nationalist sentiment in the country. In 1946, Hossein Gol-e-Golab published the nationalist song \"Ey Iran\"; it was reportedly inspired by an incident during the war in which Golab witnessed an American GI beating up a native Iranian greengrocer in a marketplace dispute.\n\nAfter the British were pushed off the continent, Germany was essentially without any opposition in Europe. British and American leaders sought to eventually establish another front opened up to engage the German military. In June 1941 Hitler launched the invasion of the USSR.\n\nThe western Allies made the strategic decision to provide Stalin with significant material support to ensure that the USSR could continue to engage a significant portion of the German military.\n\nAgreements were created (protocols) which clearly defined the type and amount of materiel that would be delivered within a given time frame. Due to German military action on the Northern route and the fact that it could not be traversed during part of the year, the US was unable to meet the demands of the first protocol. This caused increasing pressure on the Allies to develop the route using the Persian Corridor.\n\nThe Allies delivered all manner of materiel to the Soviet Union ranging from Studebaker US6 trucks to American canned food. Most of the supplies transiting through the Persian Corridor arrived by ship at various ports in the Persian Gulf and were then carried northwards by railroad or in long truck convoys. Some goods were later reloaded onboard ships to cross the Caspian Sea and others continued their journey by truck.\n\nThe United States Army forces in the corridor were originally under the Iran-Iraq Service Command - later renamed the Persian Gulf Service Command (PGSC). This was the successor to the original United States Military Iranian Mission, which had been put in place to deliver Lend-Lease supplies before the United States had entered the World War. The mission was originally commanded by Colonel Don G. Shingler, who was then replaced late in 1942 by Brigadier General Donald H. Connolly. Both the Iran-Iraq Service Command and the PGSC were subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces in the Middle East (USAFIME). PGSC was eventually renamed simply the Persian Gulf Command.\n\nOf the 17.5 million long tons of U.S. Lend-Lease aid provided to Russia, 7.9 million long tons (45%) were sent through Iran. In addition to the Persian Corridor the Americans used Arctic Convoys to the ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk and Soviet shipping carried supplies from the west coast of the United States and Canada to Vladivostok in the Far East, since the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan until August 1945.\n\nThe Persian Corridor was the route for 4,159,117 long tons (4,225,858 metric tonnes) of this cargo. However, this was not the only allied contribution via the Persian Corridor. About 7,900,000 long tons (8,000,000 metric tonnes) of shipborne cargo from Allied sources were unloaded in the Corridor, most of it bound for the USSR - but some of it for British forces under the Middle East Command, or for the Iranian economy, which was sustaining the influx of tens of thousands of foreign troops and Polish refugees. Also, supplies were needed for the development of new transportation and logistics facilities in Persia and in the Soviet Union. The tonnage figure does not include transfers of warplanes via Persia.\n\nSupplies came from as far away as Canada and the United States, and those were unloaded in Persian Gulf ports in Iran and Iraq. Once the Axis powers were cleared from the Mediterranean Sea in 1943 - with the Allied capture of Tunisia, Sicily, and southern Italy - cargo convoys were able to pass through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea to Iran for shipment to the USSR.\n\nThe main ports in the Corridor for supplies inbound to Iran were:\nin Iran,\nin Iraq,\nThe main overland routes were from the ports to Tehran, and then\nor, alternatively,\nThe main port for outbound supplies (via the Caspian Sea) was Nowshahr. Ships ferried supplies from this port to Baku or Makhachkala.\n\nImportant smaller ports and transit points on the routes included:\n\n\n\n\n\nPorts\n\nPorts\n\nCities\n\nCargo was principally handled by special British and American transportation units from the nations' respective combat service support branches, such as the Royal Army Service Corps and the United States Army Quartermaster Corps. Many Allied civilian workers, such as stevedores and railway engineers, were also employed on the corridor. Many skilled engineers, accountants and other professionals who volunteered or were drafted into the armed services were made warrant officers to help oversee the complex supply operations.\n\nIn addition to providing logistical support to the Iranians, the Allies offered other services as well. The Americans in particular were viewed as more neutral since they had no colonial past in the country as did the British and Soviets. The Americans contributed special expertise to the young Shah's government. Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf, Sr., who at the outbreak of the war was serving as superintendent of the New Jersey State Police was in August 1942 put in charge of training the Imperial Iranian Gendarmerie (his son, Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr., would command coalition forces fifty years later during the Persian Gulf War.)\n\nTo help operate trains on the demanding Trans-Iranian Railway route, the US supplied large numbers of ALCO diesel locomotives, which were more suitable than steam locomotives. About 3000 pieces of rolling stock of various types were also supplied.\n\nBeyond the Persian Corridor and across the Caspian Sea is the Volga River, flowing into the Caspian from the north. This was a key route into the core of the Soviet Union. Stalingrad, at the easternmost turn of the Volga, was an objective of the Germans in partly for reason of its industrial capacity, partly as a convenient place to block Soviet pressure on the flank of their initiative towards the Caucasus, and partly for its name. But it was also for blocking the river traffic carrying materiel north from the Persian Corridor. The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) reopened the river.\n\n\n"}

Upon receiving news of Critzer's death, Van Tassel applied for a lease of the small abandoned airport near Giant Rock from the Bureau of Land Management, and was eventually given a Federal Government contract to develop and maintain the airstrip.\n\nVan Tassel became an aircraft mechanic and flight inspector who at various times between 1930 and 1947 worked for Douglas Aircraft, Hughes Aircraft, and Lockheed. While at Hughes Aircraft he was their Top Flight Inspector. In 1947, Van Tassel left Southern California's booming aerospace industry to live in the desert with his family. At first, he lived a simple existence in the rooms Frank Critzer had dug out under Giant Rock. Van Tassel eventually built a new home, a cafe, a gas station, a store, a small airstrip, and a dude ranch beside the Rock.\n\nGeorge Van Tassel died of a heart attack in Landers, California in 1978.\n\nGeorge Van Tassel started hosting group meditation in 1953 in a room underneath Giant Rock excavated by Frank Critzer. That year, according to Van Tassel the occupant of a space ship from the planet Venus woke him up, invited him on board his space ship, and both verbally and telepathically gave him a technique for rejuvenating the human body. In 1954, Van Tassel and others began building what they called the \"Integratron\" to perform the rejuvenation. According to Van Tassel, the Integratron was to be a structure for scientific research into time, anti-gravity and at extending human life, built partially upon the research of Nikola Tesla and Georges Lakhovsky. Van Tassel described the Integratron as being created for scientific and spiritual research with the aim to recharge and rejuvenate people's cells, \"a time machine for basic research on rejuvenation, anti-gravity and time travel\". The domed wood structure has a rotating metal apparatus on the outside he called an \"electrostatic dirod\". Van Tassel claimed it was made of non-ferromagnetic materials: wood, concrete, glass, and fibreglass, lacking even metal screws or nails. The Integratron was never fully completed due to Van Tassel's sudden death a few weeks before the official opening. In recent times some people who visit the unfinished Integratron claim to be rejuvenated by staying there, and experiencing \"sound baths\" inside.\n\nVan Tassel was a classic 1950s contactee in the mold of George Adamski, Truman Bethurum, Orfeo Angelucci and many others. He hosted \"The Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention\" annually beside the Rock, from 1953 to 1978, which attracted at its peak in 1959 as many as 10,000 attendees. Guests trekked to the desert by car or landed airplanes on Van Tassel's small airstrip, called Giant Rock Airport.\n\nEvery famous contactee appeared personally at these conventions over the years, and many more not-so-famous ones. References often state that the first and most famous contactee, George Adamski, pointedly boycotted these conventions. In fact, however, Adamski attended the third convention, held in 1955, where he gave a 35-minute lecture and was interviewed by Edward J. Ruppelt, once head of the Air Force \"Project Blue Book\". It was the only such convention Adamski attended.\n\nVan Tassel founded a metaphysics research organization called The Ministry of Universal Wisdom, and The College of Universal Wisdom to codify the spiritual revelations he was now regularly receiving via communications with the people from Space.\n\nVan Tassel's book, \"I Rode A Flying Saucer\" (1952, 1955), recounts his claims of receiving \"cosmic wisdom\" from \"Solgonda\" and a large number of other people from space. Among his other works are \"Into This World and Out Again\" (1956), \"The Council of Seven Lights\" (1958), \"Religion and Science Merged\", and \"When Stars Look Down\".\n\n\n\n"}

With no formal training in animals, he spent six years studying the beasts. “I couldn’t obtain the sort of photographs I wanted for the study, so I became a photographer out of necessity,” Vavra was quoted as saying. “I’ve never been interested in the camera ... I don’t really consider myself a photographer. I’m an artist and a storyteller.”\n\nHe became immersed in the lore and life of this beast which culminated in the publishing of his book, \"Bulls of Iberia\", in 1972. He was a personal friend of legendary matador de toros Juan Belmonte, riding with him on horseback to check his herds of black bulls, and he shared the dreams, fears, adventures and valor of other toreros, such as the American John Fulton.\n\nIn 1988, Vavra established a camp in Ololasurai, Kenya and began what would become a six-year stay with the tribal Maasai people, which led to the publication of \"A Tent With a View\" in 1991.

He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 1996. He played college football at Rice. He is an assistant special teams coach for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL).\n\nA three-time Pro Bowl selection and three-time All-Pro selection, Izzo has also played for the New England Patriots. He earned three Super Bowl rings during his time with the Patriots and also won a ring during his time as an assistant Special teams coordinator for the New York Giants who coincidentally beat Izzo's former team, the Patriots, in Super Bowl XLVI.\n\nIzzo attended Broad Run High School in Ashburn, Virginia and then McCullough High School in The Woodlands, Texas, and won varsity letters in football where he was coached by Weldon Willig as a running back/safety, and in baseball. Following his senior year, Izzo was selected as the Houston Chronicle's Two-Way Player of the Year, and was a finalist for the Houston Touchdown Club's Player of the Year.\n\nLarry Izzo attended Rice University, where he wore the number 26, and was a four-year letterman and standout and finished fourth on the school's all-time tackles list with 301 tackles, setting a school-record 46 tackles for losses, and a season record of 18 tackles for losses in 1995. In 1994 an underdog Rice beat top 10 ranked Texas on national television by the score 19-17, as Izzo was selected player of the game with two key sacks (sharing the honor with teammate N. D. Kalu). It was the first time in over 30 years that Rice had beaten its in-state rival, and would help Rice win a share of the Southwest Conference title for the first time in 37 years. As a senior, Izzo was voted defensive team captain and earned consensus All-Southwest Conference honors after registering 121 tackles, he won the George Martin Award as the team's MVP and won the Jess Neely Defense Award as the team's top linebacker. Izzo was also selected as an Honorable Mention All-American.\n\nIzzo went undrafted in the 1996 NFL Draft and was later signed by the Miami Dolphins as a free agent in April 1996. He first came to local notoriety based on a sound byte that circulated during the pre-season of Izzo's rookie year, where Miami coach Jimmy Johnson told the team that only two players were guaranteed to make the team: one was Dan Marino and the other the then-unknown Izzo. He spent most of his time on special teams, and was rewarded with his first trip to the Pro Bowl in 2000.\n\nIzzo signed with Miami's divisional rival New England in 2001, and played on three of the six Patriots' Super Bowl championship teams (2001, 2003 and 2004), defeating the St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. Izzo was also part of the 2007 Patriots that were the only undefeated team since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule but had lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants 17-14. He also had two more trips to Hawaii as the AFC special team representative in 2002, and 2004. Izzo gained notoriety in 2002 in the Patriots Super Bowl parade by leading the crowd in a \"\"Yankees suck!\"\" chant, in reference to the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.\n\nIn 2008, Izzo hosted an interview segment on the NESN dating show \"Sox Appeal\".\n\nIzzo joined his third AFC East team, the New York Jets on March 11, 2009. On December 10, 2009, the Jets placed Izzo on IR after tests revealed a spine injury.\n\nOn June 24, 2011, Izzo joined the New York Giants as assistant special teams coach.. Izzo was credited with helping turn around the Giants special teams during their Super Bowl run in 2011-12. In the pivotal 2011-12 NFC Championship game, the Giant's special teams changed the momentum of the game when rookie linebacker Jacquian Williams caused a fumble on a punt return to set up Lawrence Tynes' game-winning field goal in overtime against the 49ers. The Giants went on to win the Super Bowl, and Izzo received his fourth Super Bowl ring. \n\nOn January 15, 2016, the Houston Texans hired Izzo as special teams coordinator. During Izzo's tenure with Houston the Special Teams unit improved its DVOA ranking from dead last (ranked 32 in 2015) to 26 in 2017, including finishing in the top 10 in two critical statistical areas related to coverage teams (Opponent Kickoff Return Average and Net Punt Average, which was 41.3 yds). On January 2, 2018 Texans reached a mutual parting of the ways with Izzo.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, the Seattle Seahawks hired Izzo as assistant special teams coach.\n\n\n\nIzzo and his wife Mara were married on February 21, 2004.\n\n"}

The firm worked in the Beaux-Arts tradition for elite clients in New York City, Long Island and elsewhere, building townhouses, country houses, clubs, banks and buildings for colleges and private schools. Moving on from the classical and baroque Beaux-Arts repertory, they often designed in the neo-Georgian and neo-Federal styles, and many of their buildings were clad in brick with limestone or white marble trim, a combination which came to be their trademark.\n\nDelano was born in New York City on January 21, 1874 and was a member of the prominent Delano family of Massachusetts. His parents were Eugene Delano (1844–1920) and Susan Magoun (née Adams) Delano (1848–1904). His father was an 1866 graduate of Williams College and was a partner in Brown Brothers & Company banking and trading group. Among his siblings was Moreau Delano, also a banker with Brown Brothers; and two sisters, Caroline Delano, who married Augustus B. Wadsworth (a director of the Wadsworth Center); and Susan Delano, who married Charles W. McKelvey.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Moreau Delano and Sarah Ann (née Abrams) Delano. He was a distant cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Through his maternal aunt, Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown, he was the nephew of John Crosby Brown, the head of Brown Brothers & Company. Mary Elizabeth Adams(Brown) was the minister William Adams sister, who was Delano's maternal grandfather, and for whom he was named after. The minister William Adams' wife was Martha Bradshaw Magoun, who was the maternal grandmother of Delano, and she was the daughter of Thatcher Magoun (associated with the [[Thatcher Magoun (clipper)|\"Thatcher Magoun\" clipper]] and [[60 State Street]]) and Mary Bradshaw. Previously the minister William Adams was married to Susan Patten Magoun, sister of Martha Bradshaw, before Susan Patten died. A further connection between the families resides in the offspring of John Crosby Brown and Mary Elizabeth's six children, with a son Thatcher Magoun Brown named in honor of Thatcher Magoun, along with daughter Mary Magoun Brown, and their eldest child William Adams Brown, who like Delano was also named in honor of their grandfather the minister William Adams. Furthermore, Delano's father Eugene had made partner with the Philadelphia house of Brown Brothers & Co., meanwhile his mothers middle name is Magoun.\n\nDelano was educated at the [[Lawrenceville School]] and [[Yale University]], where he served on the editorial board of campus humor magazine \"[[The Yale Record]]\" and was a member of [[Scroll and Key]], and [[Columbia University]]'s school of architecture. He also studied at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, receiving a diploma in 1903.\n\nHe met his longstanding partner [[Chester Holmes Aldrich]] when they worked together at the office of [[Carrère and Hastings]] in the years before the turn of the 20th century. They formed their partnership after Delano's return from Europe in 1903 and almost immediately won commissions from the [[Rockefeller family]], among others. Delano & Aldrich tended to adapt conservative [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] architectural styles for their townhouses, churches, schools, and a spate of social clubs for the [[Astor family|Astors]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], and the [[Whitney family|Whitneys]]. Separately (Delano was the more prolific) and in tandem they designed a number of buildings at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Delano taught at Columbia University from 1903 to 1910.\n\nDelano alone won the commission for the second-largest residence in the United States, [[Oheka Castle|Oheka]], overlooking [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York|Cold Spring Harbor]] on [[Long Island, New York]] for financier [[Otto Kahn]]. Built from 1914 to 1919 in French [[chateau]] style, with gardens by [[Olmsted Brothers]], Oheka ranges over 109,000 square feet (10,000 m²) and was staffed with 125 people.\n\nIn 1922, Delano designed the interiors of the [[Grand Central Art Galleries]], an artists' cooperative established that year by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Edmund Greacen]], [[Walter Leighton Clark]], and others. Eight years later Delano and Aldrich were asked by the organization to design the [[Venice Biennale#The United States Pavilion|U.S. Pavilion]] at the [[Venice Biennale]]. The purchase of the land, design, and construction was paid for by the Galleries and personally supervised by Clark. As he wrote in the 1934 catalog:\n\nPursuing our purpose of putting American art prominently before the world, the directors a few years ago appropriated the sum of $25,000 for the erection of an exhibition building in Venice on the grounds of the International Biennial. Messrs. Delano and Aldrich generously donated the plans for this building which is constructed of Istrian marble and pink brick and more than holds its own with the twenty-five other buildings in the Park owned by the various European governments.\n\nThe pavilion, owned and operated by the Galleries, opened on May 4, 1930. It was sold to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1954 and later to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nDelano's irreverent sense of humor was subtly expressed in some his architectural details and [[frieze]]s, such as the low-relief frieze of tortoises and hares in the apartment block at 1040 Park Avenue, and [[backgammon]] club rooms ornamented like backgammon boards. At the [[Marine Air Terminal]] at [[LaGuardia Airport]], built for [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]]' transatlantic [[seaplane]] service in 1939 and the oldest such passenger air facility still in use, his [[Art Deco]] [[terra cotta]] friezes feature [[flying fish]]. \"There is as much that is new to be said in architecture today by a man of imagination who employs traditional motifs as there is in literature by an author, who, to express his thought, still employs the English language,\" Delano wrote in 1928.\n\n[[Image:Epinal Cemetery1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Epinal American Memorial]]\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Delano was the architect for the 1927 renovation to the [[White House]], which later led to structural problems and rebuilding during the Truman Administration. (\"See\" [[White House Reconstruction]].) He served on the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] and the [[U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]] from 1924 to 1928, including a term as vice chairman in 1928. This service led to his firm receiving the design contract for the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building|New Post Office]] building, completed in 1934, in the [[Federal Triangle]] complex. Delano served on the board of design for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and consulted on the controversial White House [[Truman Balcony]] in 1946, prior to the reconstruction project of 1949-52.\n\nDelano's many awards and honors include election to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1940. In 1948, Delano was commissioned to design the [[Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial]] (1948 – 1956), one of fourteen [[World War II]] monuments constructed abroad by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]. Delano also designed terminals at La Guardia and Miami airports.\n\nHe was named an officer by the French [[Legion of Honour]] and was an academician of the National Academy of Design. In 1953, the [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded William Adams Delano its [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]].\n\nDelano continued to practice almost until his death in 1960. Aldrich had left the partnership in 1935 to become the resident director of the [[American Academy at Rome]], where he died in 1940.\n\nDelano married Louisa Millicent Sheffield (née Potter) on May 23, 1907. His son, William Richard Potter Delano, was born on July 31, 1909. His son married Dorothea Frances Lehmann in October 1939.\n\nDelano died on January 12, 1960, aged 85, in New York City.\n\n\n[[Category:Delano & Aldrich buildings|*]]\n[[Category:1874 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:American Neoclassical architects]]\n[[Category:Art Deco architects]]\n[[Category:Historicist architects]]\n[[Category:Architects from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Institute of Architects]]\n[[Category:Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation alumni]]\n[[Category:Delano family|William Adams]]\n[[Category:Defunct architecture firms based in New York City]]\n[[Category:20th-century American architects]]"}

It consists of a fragmentary fire-damaged parchment codex that was acquired by the Egyptian Museum of Berlin in 1961 (accessioned as Papyrus Berolinensis 22220). Its nature was only discovered in 1991, when it came round to being conserved (the sheer number of similar manuscripts being conserved causing the 30-year delay), and was revealed in a 1996 lecture by Charles W. Hedrick. It has been edited and translated into English by Hedrick and Paul Mirecki (Hedrick and Mirecki 1999) and by Bart D. Ehrman (Ehrman 2003). The fragmentary nature of the text admits of more than one sequential ordering of the contents, giving rise to more than one useful translation, and some public discussion (see § References).\n\nThe manuscript appears to date from the 6th century; Hellenisms in the vocabulary and grammar suggest that it was translated from a lost Greek original. The hypothetic original Greek text on which it is based is thought to have been composed somewhere in the late second or early third century, judging from the theology and style. The Gospel is not a narrative but a dialogue, a form often chosen in Antiquity for didactic material.\n\nThe content is heavily Gnostic in that salvation is available only to those who understand the secret knowledge (\"gnosis\"), and also shows parallels with the Gospel of Peter, in that the significance of the Crucifixion is somewhat watered down, being considered a part of a heavenly journey, an idea much more in keeping with a Gnostic world-view. The unnamed Saviour (assumed to be Jesus) engages in a dialogue with his apostles that is somewhat more personal than is found elsewhere. And at one point, the cross itself is addressed, as if it is a living creature, a companion rather than a device for death.\n\n\nChronologically:\n\n"}

He joined Lauenburger Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 9 of Ratzeburg, serving on the Western Front. In 1915, the youngest man in the division, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd class as the best scout in the region during the Battle of the Somme.

He is probably remembered best for his role as the blustery newspaper editor Perry White in the 1950s television program \"Adventures of Superman\".\n\nJohn Hamilton was born in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania to John M. Hamilton and his wife Cornelia J. (Hollar) Hamilton. Hamilton was the youngest of four children, and his mother died eight days after his birth. His father remarried and Rosa, his stepmother, was the only mother the young Hamilton knew. Hamilton grew up in neighboring Southampton Township Pennsylvania, where his father worked as a store clerk.\n\nHamilton's father was also appointed Shippensburg's trustee for the State Superintendent of Public Education, so it was a foregone conclusion that Hamilton would receive extensive schooling. Unlike most others of his generation and background (Southampton being a farming community), Hamilton attended college-- Dickinson College and Shippensburg State Teacher's College. He opted to forgo teaching for a stage career, however.\n\nAfter becoming an actor, he worked in Broadway plays and in touring theatrical companies for many years prior to his 1930 movie debut. He was in the original Broadway company of the 1922 play \"Seventh Heaven\" and would appear in the movie remake (\"Seventh Heaven\") in 1937. He featured with Donald Meek in a series of short mysteries based on S.S. Van Dine stories for Warner Bros. He was often typecast in the role of an authority figure; to wit, prison warden, judge, politician or police chief, but played various types of characters, appearing in more than three hundred movies, movie serials or television programs from the 1930s through the 1950s. As an example, he does a brief turn in robes as the judge who passes sentence on soon-to-be-racketeer James Cagney for violation of the Volstead Act in \"The Roaring Twenties\" (1939). Hamilton appeared as a police inspector in the John Huston film \"In This Our Life\" in 1942. Modern-day serial fans can see Hamilton's iconic persona already developing as Professor Gordon, the outwardly no-nonsense but secretly compassionate father of young, man-of-action Flash Gordon in \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" (1940). He became much more widely known when he was cast as the irascible \"Daily Planet\" newspaper editor Perry White in the 1950s TV classic \"Adventures of Superman\" (1951).

The project was commissioned to produce plutonium-239 by neutron activation as part of the Manhattan Project, the United States nuclear weapons development program during World War II. The B reactor was fueled with metallic natural uranium, graphite moderated, and water-cooled. It has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark since August 19, 2008 and in July 2011 the National Park Service recommended that the B Reactor be included in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park commemorating the Manhattan Project. Visitors can take a tour of the reactor by advance reservation.\n\nThe reactor was designed and built by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company based on experimental designs tested by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, and tests from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was designed to operate at 250 megawatts (thermal).\n\nThe reactor occupies a footprint of (about and is tall, occupying a volume of . The reactor core itself consisted of a graphite box measuring occupying a volume of and weighing . It was penetrated horizontally through its entire length by 2,004 aluminum tubes and vertically by channels for the vertical safety rods.\n\nThe core is surrounded by a thermal shield of cast iron thick weighing . Masonite and steel plates enclose the thermal shield on its top and sides, forming a biological shield for radiation protection. The bottom of the thermal shield is supported by a concrete pad topped by cast-iron blocks. The graphite composition was selected to moderate the nuclear reaction fueled by of uranium slugs approximately diameter long (the approximate size of a roll of quarters), sealed in aluminum cans, and loaded into the aluminum tubes.\n\nThe reactor was water-cooled, with cooling water pumped from the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River through the aluminum tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of per minute. The water was discharged into settling basins, then returned to the river after allowing time for the decay of radioactive materials, the settling out of particulate matter and for the water to cool so it could be returned to the Columbia River. Water returning to the river was prohibited from raising the temperature of the river by more than 11 °F.\n\nThe B Reactor had its first nuclear chain reaction in September, 1944, the D Reactor in December 1944 and the F Reactor in February 1945. The reactor produced plutonium-239 by irradiating uranium-238 with neutrons generated by the nuclear reaction. It was one of three reactors – along with the D and F reactors – built about six miles (10 km) apart on the south bank of the Columbia River. Each reactor had its own auxiliary facilities that included a river pump house, large storage and settling basins, a filtration plant, large motor-driven pumps for delivering water to the face of the pile, and facilities for emergency cooling in case of a power failure.\n\nEmergency shutdown of the reactor, referred to as a SCRAM, was attained either by rapidly fully inserting the vertical safety rods or, as a backup method, by the injection of borated water into the reactor. In January 1952, the borated water system was replaced by a \"Ball-3X\" system that injected nickel-plated high-boron steel balls into the channels occupied by the vertical safety rods.\n\nThe plutonium for the nuclear bomb used in the Trinity test in New Mexico and the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan was created in the B reactor. B reactor ran for two decades, and was joined by additional reactors constructed later. The B Reactor was permanently shut down in February 1968.\n\nThe United States Department of Energy has administered the site since 1977 and offers public tours on set dates during the spring, summer, and fall of the year, as well as special tours for visiting officials.\n\nIn a process called cocooning or entombment, the reactor buildings are demolished up to the concrete shield around the reactor core. Any openings are sealed and a new roof is built. Most auxiliary buildings at the first three reactors have been demolished, as well.\nThe C reactor was put into operation in 1952 and was shut down in 1969. It was cocooned as of 1998.\nThe D reactor operated from 1944 to June 1967, and was cocooned in 2004. The DR Reactor went online in October 1950, and was shut down in 1964. It was cocooned in 2002.\nThe F reactor was shut down in June 1965 and cocooned in 2003.\nThe H Reactor became operational as of October 1949 and was shut down as of April 1965. It was cocooned as of 2005.\nCocooning of the N-Reactor, which operated from 1963 to 1987, was completed as of June 14, 2012.\nThe decommissioned reactors are inspected every five years by the Department of Energy.\n\nThe K East and K West reactors were built in the 1950s and went into use in 1955. They were shut down in 1970 and 1971, but reused temporarily for storage later.\nPreliminary plans for interim stabilizing of the K-East and K-West reactors were underway as of January 30, 2018.\n\nThe B Reactor was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#) on April 3, 1992. A Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in 1999, and an EPA Action Memorandum in 2001 authorized hazards mitigation in the reactor with the intention of allowing public tours of the reactor. It was named a National Historic Landmark on August 19, 2008.\n\nIn December 2014, passage of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) made the B reactor part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, which also includes historic sites at Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Los Alamos, New Mexico. The park was formally established by a Memorandum of Agreement on November 10, 2015, which was signed by the National Park Service and the Department of Energy. Museum development at Hanford may include the B Reactor, Bruggemann's Warehouse, Hanford High School, Pump House, and White Bluffs Bank.\n\n\n\n"}

A question arose pertaining to the ransoming of Roman captives; he referred the matter to the Senate. He was one of the three men appointed \"triumviri mensarii\", a commission created by a \"Lex Minucia\", possibly to deal with a shortage of silver; the full range of their financial activities is unclear. He was \"praetor peregrinus\" in 204 and sent to Cisalpine Gaul.\n\nLucius Scribonius Libo (tribune of the \"plebs\" 149 BC) was a member of a Roman Senatorial family. He accused Servius Sulpicius Galba for the outrages against the Lusitanians. He might have been the Scribonius who consecrated the Puteal Scribonianum often mentioned by ancient writers, which was located in the forum close to the Arcus Fabianus. It was called Puteal as it was opened at the top, like a well. Years later it would be repaired and dedicated by another Libo, praetor of 80 BC.\n\nLucius Scribonius Libo (fl. 1st century BC) was a member of a Roman Senatorial family, and held the office of praetor urbanus in 80 BC. \n\nHe is known to have had at least one son of the same name, who became consul in 34 BC. He is also cited as the most likely candidate for the father of Scribonia, second wife of Augustus and mother of his only biological child, Julia the Elder. If so, then he would have married at least once to Sentia, whose ancestors had been directors of the mint. \n\nIn 62 BC Scribonius was made monetalis during which he repaired the Puteal Scribonianum and issued coins to commemorate the event.\n\nLucius Scribonius Libo (fl. 1st century BC) was the son of the above, and likely the elder brother or half-brother of Scribonia, first wife of Augustus. His wife was a member of the gens Sulpicia.\n\nWhen the civil war broke in 49 BC he sided with Pompey and was in command of Etruria. Afterward he accompanied Pompey to Greece. Following the death of Bibulus he was given command of the Pompeian fleet. During the civil wars that occurred after the assassination of Julius Caesar, he sided with his son-in-law Sextus Pompey. In 40 BC Octavian, married his sister and she bore him his only natural child Julia. After this marriage a peace was made between the Triumvirs (second triumvirate) and Sextus with the Pact of Misenum in 39 BC. After the war was renewed in 36 BC, Scribonius felt the cause was lost and abandoned Sextus. \n\nIn 34 BC he was consul with Mark Antony. Lucius and wife had three children, two sons: Lucius Scribonius Libo (below) and Marcus Scribonius Libo Drusus and a daughter Scribonia who married Sextus Pompey.\n\nLucius Scribonius Libo (died 16 AD) was son of the above. He was a consul in 16. This nobleman was brother of Marcus Scribonius Libo, who had planned to revolt against Emperor Tiberius.\n\n"}

Auel published in 1990. It is the sequel to \"The Mammoth Hunters\" and fourth in the Earth's Children series.\n\n\"The Plains of Passage\" describes the journey of Ayla and Jondalar west along the Great Mother River (the Danube), from the home of The Mammoth Hunters (roughly modern Ukraine) to Jondalar's homeland (close to Les Eyzies, Dordogne, France). During this journey, Ayla meets the various peoples who live along their line of march. These meetings, the attitudes and beliefs of these groups, and Ayla's response form an essential part of the story.\n\nCharacters range in description from innocent to bloodthirsty, from serious to comical, from noble to corrupt, from found to lost, and from peaceful to violent. All of these adjectives apply in some way to either Jondalar or Ayla. Ayla (and to some extent Jondalar) is often viewed by her new friends as mystic or supernatural, partially due to her friendships with the world's first known domesticated horses and wolf, but also due to her generous nature and wisdom.\n\nAs they encounter people Jondalar and his brother met on their journey eastward they have a hard time leaving them, especially after an offer to become joined with a high-ranking Sharamudoi couple. Jondalar declines the offer, giving as excuse his desire to have the lead mystic of his people search for and help his deceased brother cross over to the other side.\n\nIt concludes with Ayla and Jondalar's successful return to the Zelandoni, and Ayla's stated pregnancy, and Whinney's definite pregnancy.\n\n\"The Plains of Passage\" is one of the longer books in the Earth's Children series. It was followed by \"The Shelters of Stone.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly gave the novel a B+ upon its release in 1990, saying it has a \"low-intensity fascination [similar to] an actual hike through the wilderness\". Entertainment Weekly also claims \"Auel's main strength is melodrama that has been enlisted in the service of a serious, \"improving\" message that a lot of people want to receive. In Auel's case the didactic component is a postfeminist allegory that validates Woman's new place in society, with one foot in the (hunting/ gathering) workplace and the other still solidly planted on the domestic hearth\". Auel is often praised for her knowledge on the Paleolithic, and this chapter in the Earth's Children series is no exception.\n\n\"The Plains of Passage\" spent weeks on the New York Times best sellers list from 1990–1991. The novel currently holds a 3.7/5 on Goodreads and a 4.5/5 on the Barnes and Noble website. Many readers found this book to have tedious details and meticulous information, but was enjoyable overall.\n\n"}

He was the great grandson of Pompey.\n\nAlong with his brother Lucius Scribonius Libo, he was accused of conspiring against the Roman Emperor Tiberius. This included asking a fortune-teller if he would be rich enough to pave the Via Appia, as far as Brundisium or Brindisi with money. Tacitus described the accusations against Libo as 'preposterous' and 'pointless'.\n\nThe two men were tried in a senatorial court by the Emperor Tiberius. At the trial, Marcus was ill and pleaded for mercy. A maternal relative, Publius Sulpicius Quirinus, defended them and appealed to the Emperor. Tiberius told him to apply to the senate.\n\nTiberius wanted to investigate Libo's slaves but there was a senatorial decree preventing confessions from tortured slaves from being used in trials against their own masters. To get around this Tiberius had Libo's slaves sold to the treasury agent, then the accusations made against Libo were considered confirmed by Libo's ex slaves.\n\nHis aunt, Scribonia (second wife of Roman Emperor Augustus), tried to convince Marcus to face trial rather than commit suicide.

The film launched Sternberg's eight-year collaboration with Paramount Pictures, with whom he would produce his seven films with actress Marlene Dietrich. Journalist and screenwriter Ben Hecht won an Academy Award for Best Original Story.\n\nBoisterous gangster kingpin 'Bull' Weed rehabilitates the down-and-out 'Rolls Royce' Wensel, a former lawyer who has fallen into alcoholism. The two become confidants, with Rolls Royce's intelligence aiding Weed's schemes, but complications arise when Rolls Royce falls for Weed's girlfriend 'Feathers' McCoy.\n\nAdding to Weed's troubles are attempts by a rival gangster, 'Buck' Mulligan, to muscle in on his territory. Their antagonism climaxes with Weed killing Mulligan and he is imprisoned, awaiting a death sentence. Rolls Royce devises an escape plan, but he and Feathers face a dilemma, wondering if they should elope together and leave Bull Weed to his fate.\n\n\nJosef von Sternberg's brief tenure as director at M-G-M was terminated by mutual consent in 1925 shortly after he walked off the set of a Mae Murray vehicle The Masked Bride. The film was completed by director Christy Cabanne\n\nStenberg's next project was an assignment by Charlie Chaplin (United Artists) to write and direct A Woman of the Sea starring Edna Purviance. This episode also ended badly: the film was never released and Chaplin felt compelled to destroy all film negatives. As Sternberg sardonically quipped in his 1965 memoir \"Fun in a Chinese Laundry\", \"It was [Edna Purviance]'s last film and nearly my own.\" \n\nSternberg accepted a contract offer from Paramount Pictures in 1926, with the humbling condition that he was demoted to the role of assistant director. He was quickly assigned to reshoot portions of director Frank Lloyd's \"Children of Divorce\". His work was so outstanding that the studio awarded him with a project of his own. The result was his most famous film to date of his career -\"Underworld\". The film would \"establish Sternberg in the Hollywood system.\"\n\n\"Underworld\" is based on a story by Ben Hecht, a former Chicago crime reporter, and adapted for screenplay by Robert N. Lee with titles by George Marion Jr.. It was produced by B. P. Schulberg and Hector Turnbull with cinematography by Bert Glennon and edited by E. Lloyd Sheldon. Sternberg completed \"Underworld\" in a record-setting five weeks.\n\nThe gangster role played by George Bancroft was modeled on \"Terrible\" Tommy O'Connor, an Irish-American mobster who gunned down Chicago Police Chief Padraig O'Neil in 1923 but escaped three days before execution and was never apprehended.\n\nParamount Pictures, initially cool towards the production, predicted the film would fail. Initial release was limited to only one theater, the New York Paramount. The studio did not provide advance publicity. Writer Ben Hecht requested (unsuccessfully) to have his name taken off the credits, due to the dismal prospects for the film.\n\nContrary to studio expectations, the public response to the New York screening was so positive that Paramount arranged for round-the-clock showings at the Paramount Theatre to \"accommodate the unexpected crowds that flocked to the attraction.\"\n\n\"Time\" felt the film was realistic in some parts, but disliked the Hollywood cliché of turning an evil character's heart to gold at the end.\n\n\"Underworld\" was well-received overseas, especially in France, where directors Julien Duvivier and Marcel Carné were deeply impressed with Sternberg's \"clinical and spartan\" film technique. Filmmaker and surrealist Luis Buñuel named \"Underworld\" as his all time favorite film.\n\nParamount, overjoyed at the film's \"critical and commercial success\" bestowed a gold medal and a $10,000 bonus on Sternberg.\nBen Hecht won the Academy Award for Writing in the 1st Academy Awards ceremony in 1929 for his work on this film.\n\nIn 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.\n\nSternberg has been credited with \"launching the gangster film genre.\" Critic Andrew Sarris cautions that \"Underworld\" is \"less a proto-gangster film than a pre-gangster film\" in which the criminal world of the Prohibition Era provides a backdrop for a tragic tale of a \"Byronic hero\" destroyed, not by \"the avenging forces of law and order\" but by the eternal vicissitudes of \"love, faith and falsehood.\"\n\nJournalist Ben Hecht's influence appears in the phony flower shop operation and killing of \"Bull\" Weed's archenemy, \"florist\" Buck Mulligan, evoking the 1922 real-life murder of kingpin Dion O'Bannon by the Tony Torrios mob. Funeral hearses also abound in the film, notorious as capacious conveyances used to conceal criminal activities and personnel in Chicago. Despite these contemporary references, \"Underworld\" does not qualify as \"the first gangster film\" as Sternberg \"showed little interest in the purely gangsterish aspects of the genre\" nor the \"mechanics of [mob] power.\" Rather than invoking contemporary social forces and inequities, Sternberg's \"Bull\" Weed is subject to \"implacable Fate\", much as the heroes of classical antiquity. The female companions to the outlaws are less gangster molls, addicted to violent men, but protagonists in their own right, who induce \"revenge and redemption.\" The genre would only be properly established in such film classics as Little Caesar (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), Scarface (1932), High Sierra (1941), White Heat (1949), The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and The Killing (1956).\n\nFilm critic Dave Kehr, writing for the Chicago Reader in 2014, rates \"Underworld\" as one of the great gangster films of the silent era. \"The film established the fundamental elements of the gangster movie: a hoodlum hero; ominous, night-shrouded city streets; floozies; and a blazing finale in which the cops cut down the protagonist.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832035", "title": "Bionicle Legends", "text": "Bionicle Legends\n\nBionicle Legends is the third book series based in the Bionicle universe. It ended in 2008 and was succeeded by a new, final 3-book series, titled \"Bionicle Super Chapter Books\". Bionicle Legends covered the events that occurred in the storyline's 2006–2008 story arc. It follows the \"Bionicle Adventures\" series; but as \"Adventures\" is almost exclusively told in flashbacks, the events preceding those in \"Legends\" are told in the first book series, \"Bionicle Chronicles\".\n\nIn \"Bionicle Legends\", the Great Spirit Mata Nui is dying, and the universe will die with him if nothing is done. A new group of Toa must find the Mask of Life that can save him before it is too late, but other, more sinister groups also desire such a powerful mask for their own purposes.\n\nThe 2006 arc of \"Legends\" was adapted into the Bionicle Heroes video game.\n\nDespite not being named as such on the titles, the 2009 book, \"Raid on Vulcanus\" was labeled as being part of Bionicle Legends on some websites. However, it was actually part of another book series, \"Bionicle Super Chapter Books\".\n\nThe main events of the \"Legends\" story arc are told in:\n\nThe following sources provide background information and tell side stories taking place during \"Bionicle Legends\":\n\nThe reconstruction of Metru Nui is underway as the Turaga call a meeting with the Toa Nuva and Toa Takanuva. Turaga Dume and Nuju reveal their discovery. By studying the stars, they have found the Great Spirit has fallen from his coma-like state and is dying. After his death, the universe will die along with it in three days. His only chance of survival is if the Toa Nuva recover the legendary Kanohi Ignika, the Mask of Life, to save him. Dume leads the Toa Nuva underground to Toa Canisters and sends them off to the island of Voya Nui while Toa Takanuva stays behind to guard the metropolis.\n\nOn Voya Nui, the Piraka, Zaktan, Avak, Thok, Reidak, Vezok, and Hakann, arrive and masquerade as Toa. Despite their claims, it is their frightening appearance and demeanor which primarily makes the Matoran natives fall into the Piraka's plot. Thus, the Matoran survivalists are convinced, and begin the construction of the Piraka's fortress, the Stronghold, as well as temples and statues in their honor. They are also used to dig trenches for \"lava-farming\" out of Mount Valmai to search for the Ignika. This makes six Matoran suspicious of their claims, and form the \"Voya Nui Resistance Team\". They watch the Piraka closely and take place in the theft of a mysterious artifact they created, a Zamor Launcher, ultimately believing they will use the weapon against them.\n\nMeanwhile, in Metru Nui, Jaller—a Ta-Matoran and close friend to Takanuva, the Toa of Light—begins to suspect that the Turaga were hiding something from the Matoran. He and Takanuva confronted them about this but when the Turaga refusedto reveal the truth, Jaller staged a Metru-wide boycott (i.e. the Matoran all stop repairing the damage to Metru Nui) and would not end it until the Turaga tell the Mataoran what's going on.\n\nAfter skirmishes with the Piraka, including Dalu's attempt to increase Avak's senses, Hakann and Avak create a monster of rock and lava to fool the Matoran, and defeat the monster, hopefully to better the Piraka's image. Using Antidermis, a mysterious substance that the Piraka have found on the island, Zaktan creates a Zamor Sphere to test upon a Ta-Matoran subject named Dezalk, which makes the Matoran obedient and loyal, sending him to assemble the Matoran where the Piraka enslave the Voya Nui Matoran save the resistance team. Meanwhile, the Toa Nuva arrive, and despite the Resistance Team's intervention, are surprised and defeated by the Piraka after a fierce battle. Zaktan commands their tools and Kanohi are to be stripped, and the Toa Nuva to burn in Mt. Valmai. During this time, Balta, in an attempt to steal a Zamor Sphere, traps himself in a cave.\n\nBack on Metru Nui, Jaller organizes a labor strike until the Turaga divulge the Toa Nuva's sudden disappearance, believing the Matoran have been protected too closely for far too long. Turaga Nokama meets with Jaller secretly to reveal the truth about Mata Nui and the Toa Nuva's mission.\n\nOn Metru Nui, Turaga Dume holds a conference with the Turaga. He reviews the events of the previous meeting and confesses his doubts on the Toa Nuva, who have not returned with the Ignika. More importantly, he accuses the Turaga of revealing this, as Takanuva and Jaller recruited 5 of the breavest Matoran to mount a rescue mission; the team departed the night before, vanishing into the Underwater Chutes of Le-Metru. Nokama confesses, and the Turaga are forced to wait as Takanuva is not available to dispatch. At the same time, Takanuva, Jaller and the other 5 Matoran emerges from a Chute onto a land bridge.\n\nTakanuva attempts to unsuccessfully persuade Jaller to return to Metru Nui and let him continue the mission, and scouts ahead up a tunnel. When he uses his Light powers to illuminate the tunnel, he finds his Light powers are disabled in the tunnel, and becomes disoriented and confused. After a while, the Matoran team decide to enter the tunnel, their Lightstones fail, and they link themselves with cable and continue to talk to ensure they would not become separated.\n\nMatoro, one of the six Matoran, is worried as Nuju said the way to Voya Nui was through a \"land of the dead\", but is ignored. He then no longer hears his allies' voices even when he shouts, and stumbles in the darkness. He feels a hand grab out to him and helps the figure to his feet, and continues to follow the cable, where the Matoran and Takanuva await. The figure is no longer in the tunnel, and is revealed to be an extension of the Kanohi Ignika. They continue down a long strip of land, with a stone archway far away.\n\nJaller offers if anyone wants to turn away do so now, but no one declines. Hahli wonders about Takanuva and Teridax, and if Teridax's defeat was intentional, and Hewkii finds a Kanohi Suletu, Takanuva acknowledging its existence by wearing the Kanohi and listening on Hahli's thoughts. The team sets down close to the Archway, Jaller standing guard as the Matoran slept. Jaller questions Matoro's attitude after they escaped the tunnel, but they are interrupted by Takanuva sighting a Matoran in the archway, which awakens the others. They continue toward the Archway, Takanuva explaining that the Matoran disappeared before contact was made, and he attempts to pass through the Archway only to be repelled, along with the power of light.\n\nThe Matoran pass through the Archway, but are unable to get back. Hahli warns them from a tablet she found, describing that \"This is a realm of shadow ... of famine and plague and blight ... This is a world of darkness ... and there is no place for light.\" Sadly, Takanuva is forced to depart for Metru Nui again and the Matoran continue onward, with a message to update the Turaga and not send any assistance. The team continues up a mountain, and are met by eight Manas. They are led into a canyon of Matoran in various states of disrepair. The land is desolate, waterfalls of dust, volcanoes of hot ice, thunderless lighting and thunder-producing water. The ground screams as they walk past stone statues of Matoran and the un-repaired Matoran follow them. They are led to an armored being, with a horrific patch-work mask and chains of fire. His name is Karzahni, the ruler of this land named in his honor.\n\nHahli remembers this place from the Turaga's tales, where \"lazy\" Matoran were sent. Karzahni describes a hundred thousand years ago, Matoran of laziness and disrepair were sent here, and when the team mentions Mata Nui would not accept such a place, he is confused. The Matoran then confiscate the Matoran's supplies and tools (to strip their identity), and when asked for their masks, Jaller refuses, knowing that his Kanohi Hau was belonged to the late Toa Lhikan. He is forced to carry out his wishes when Karzahni gives him a vision of an alternate future where Takua dies.\n\nThe Matoran are re-purposed, Hahli works with Karzahni. As the Chronicler, she educates him in the events of the past hundred centuries. The other Matoran are put to work in the furnaces, where they meet an Av-Matoran who resided there before the light-barrier Archway was constructed. With his mind broken, he rambles about his previous identity, working in a \"world that feeds the world\" where he constructed the Toa Canisters. He reveals a set where hidden in Karzahni, and despite his warnings that Matoran would not survive the journey, they journey underground to them. Karzahni tries to stop them, but when Matoro goads him, he gives a vision of the death of the Great Spirit and its effects. The vision is so appalling that the tyrant hesitates, and Jaller's team escape for Voya Nui.\n\nOn Voya Nui, the Piraka carry the unconscious Toa Nuva to Mt. Valmai, but an eruption stops them from doing so, and they flee. The Toa Nuva regain consciousness in time to save themselves. After recovering, the run into the Voya Nui Resistance Team, but the group believes them as threats as well, and they attack the Toa Nuva, who refuse to retliate against that which they chose to protect. Gali Nuva is driven insane when Dalu enhances her sight, and flees from the area, coming into the custody of Axonn, who heals her and frees Balta from the cave. The two return to the conflict and the Toa Nuva and Matoran ally, and they journey for the Piraka's Stronghold to find the Nuva's Kanohi and tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaktan is furious upon the Toa Nuva's survival. He reveals the Piraka's seventh member, Vezon, briefly, and sends Thok to work the Matoran harder, as the volcano had slowed after the eruption. Zaktan later meets with Brutaka, and Hakann overhears. He fires a Zamor Sphere at the titan, which only appears to make him stronger. He follows the gold and blue armored warrior, and strikes a deal that if he can control the Zamor Spheres, he can grant them to Brutaka, they too journey to the Stronghold. Coincidentally, Avak and Thok, searching for the Toa by the green belt of Voya Nui, realize the Ignika must be hidden there, and conclude Zaktan was using Mount Valmai as a diversion. They retreat to the Piraka Stronghold to confront him.\n\nA battle begins within the Stronghold between the Piraka. Reidak attempts to enter the Stronghold and encounters the Toa Nuva, accidentally aiding them in getting inside. The Toa Nuva recover their tools and masks. Zaktan once again resumes control of Brutaka, offering the secret of Antidermis. Brutaka defeats the Toa Nuva and the Matoran, and he takes the Toa into his custody. The Piraka, whose loose alliance is now on the verge of being completely broken, interrogate the Matoran.\n\nJust offshore from Voya Nui, the transport pods carrying Jaller and the others arrives just as the mysterious Red Star shoots a bolt of energy at the canisters. The bolt splits into six and strikes them. When the Matoran emerged, they were no longer Matoran, but Toa.\n\nFrom afar, Axonn watches the defeat of the Toa Nuva and the Voya Nui Resistance Team. He reflects upon how they ended up there. Axonn and Brutaka are part of an organization named the Order of Mata Nui, devoted to the Great Spirit. They were assigned to protect the Kanohi Ignika on Voya Nui, unfortunately, Brutaka lost faith within their mission, as Voya Nui separated itself from the Southern Continent and the Great Cataclysm. Soon, Brutaka betrayed his mission to ally himself with the Piraka to ultimately steal the Kanohi Ignika.\n\nBrutaka, as well ponders his history, while aiding the Piraka in interrogating the Voya Nui Resistance Team, and when Dalu attempts an escape, he saves her from a Doom Viper. He leaves, troubled by his choices. After the incident, Garan is questioned, and the Piraka are troubled by the sight of six Spirit Stars, specifically the Toa Inika's. Vezok attempts to throw him in a crevice of lava, but he is rescued by the Voya Nui Resistance Team.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toa Inika start to figure out their next move; noting especially odd things about their transformation like glowing faces and living masks. They end up triggering their mask powers, causing chaos as Nuparu flies uncontrollably, Kongu can't keep from hearing others' thoughts, Matoro's spirit is separated from his body, and Hahli seems to be talking to thin air. As they regain control, Matoro reports that he saw the Matoran, and the Toa agree that they need to meet them and figure out what's going on in this island.\n\nAfter a scuffle with Vezok, the Toa meet the Matoran rebels and compare notes on what they know. Armed with Zamor Launchers built by Velika, they split up into three groups: Jaller and Hahli go to free enslaved Matoran, Hewkii and Matoro go visit Axonn, and Kongu and Nuparu sneak into the Piraka stronghold to search for the Toa Nuva. While Jaller and Hahli's mission has no problems; Hewkii and Matoro find Axonn badly injured by Brutaka, telling them to stop his former partner even if it means killing him. Worse, Kongu and Nuparu are discovered and faced with all six Piraka and Brutaka.\n\nThankfully, the other Toa arrive just as the battle starts and Hewkii is able to bury Brutaka under a pile of rock, taking him out of the fight temporarily. While the Matoran search the stronghold for the Toa Nuva, the Toa Inika, thanks to their unique mask powers and unpredictable fighting style due to their recent transformation, begin taking the Piraka out one by one. But the tides turn when Brutaka begins to dig himself out: Hakann enacts the plan to steal Brutaka's power for himself, Avak, Reidak, and Thok—but he intended to take it all for himself, and only quick action by Thok allowed him to take a share of Brutaka's power as well. The two quickly use their new strength to turn on the others, with Hakann knocking them all out with one superpowered mental blast.\n\nWhen everyone comes to, they realize that Hakann and Thok had forced the weakened Brutaka to reveal the location of the Mask of Life. Axonn arrives and begins to go after the two Piraka, but Jaller tells him to swallow his pride and let others help, to which Axonn agrees. Realizing that the best way to stop the two is to return Brutaka's power to him and that the Piraka are the only ones who know how to do that, the two groups form an uneasy alliance. While the Piraka work on the Zamor Sphere that will depower Hakann and Thok, Axonn warns Jaller of the mask's guardians and hands him a glowing Zamor for \"protection\". At the same time, the Matoran are continuing their search, and they find records of Voya Nui's history - it was long thought that many were lost when some of the land sank underwater, but these records say that they may still be alive underwater as a prelude to the Mahri Nui story.\n\nMeanwhile, Hakann and Thok have begun to turn on each other. The resulting destruction makes them easy to track, and the Toa Inika and other Piraka quickly arrive on the scene (Axonn chose to stay behind). Though most of the Piraka are taken out of the fight early, Hakann and Thok are soon put at a disadvantage by the Inika. The two call a truce and launch a combined attack, but at the same moment Hewkii hits them with the specially prepared Zamor. As a result, both sides fall unconscious from their enemies' assault; leaving only Zaktan standing. By the time the Toa Inika awaken, the Piraka are already up and gone, headed down a staircase that leads to the Mask of Life. Agreeing that they can't wait for reinforcements, they quickly follow.\n\nThis portion of the storyline describes the Piraka's history, involvement in the Dark Hunters and subsequent betrayal and the events leading up to their journey to Voya Nui, described by Zaktan's experiences and tales of the Piraka, \"a legacy of evil\". The book was initially proposed to come with a Piraka Lego mini-figure.\n\n\"7,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nVezok and Hakann, two Skakdi, raid a Toa fortress in search of an artifact. As Hakann creates a fracas to distract the Toa, Vezok finds the artifact, a tablet named the Makoki Stone, with barely discernible writing detailing the Brotherhood of Makuta, in the event that they would rebel. They depart the Fortress and are captured by the Dark Hunter \"Ancient\", who confiscates the artifact and recruits the Dark Hunters along with four Skakdi, Zaktan, Avak, Thok, and Reidak.\n\n\"5,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nZaktan leads his Skakdi peers (minus Avak) in an unsuccessful maneuver to overthrow the Shadowed One, but are confused by the transforming walls of the fortress. The Shadowed One attempts to execute Zaktan for his treacherous leadership of the plot, but his disintegration vision instead transforms Zaktan into a mass of sentient protodites.\n\n\"4,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nIn a blackmail scheme, the Shadowed One sends Reidak, Vezok, and Avak to free the Kanohi Dragon from imprisonment in the seas around Metru Nui, leaving the Rahi to rampage upon the city. When the trio meet with Turaga Dume to offer protection in the event the Dark Hunters' are allowed to establish a base, he declines. Therefore, Vezok attempts an assassination, but is unsuccessful due to the arrival of Toa Lhikan and his Toa Mangai team. The Toa eventually defeat the beast and deport it to Xia, where Roodaka awaits its arrival.\n\n\"3,000 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nThe Toa/Dark Hunter War, beginning as a result of Dume refusing to establish Dark Hunter bases within Metru Nui, is well underway. Hakann oversees Nidhiki's betrayal and Lhikan overhearing the matter. He bargains with the Toa of Fire, Nidhiki for the Makoki Stone which Lhikan guarded long ago. He agrees, but six months later, the Dark Hunters have it within their possession again, split into six, and auctioned to the Brotherhood at a profitable price. Roodaka then mutates Nidhiki into an insectoid being, dooming him to a lifetime with the Hunters.\n\n\"250 years prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nZaktan, Thok, and Reidak guard Odina against the Brotherhood during the Dark Hunter/Brotherhood War. As the Hunters' are occupied with an unsuccessful Brotherhood attack of Rahkski, Exo-Toa, and Visorak, Zaktan learns from Roodaka the base was initially in the possession of the Brotherhood. Zaktan investigates the matter and uses his protodite abilities to find an entire record of the Brotherhood and their Plan. Zaktan vows to use this knowledge to his nefarious ends.\n\n\"One month prior to the events of BIONICLE Legends\":\n\nZaktan recruits his five fellow Skakdi and rebel against the Hunters. Now rogue, they investigate Teridax's lair after his supposed death, which happens just as the Matoran arrive in Metru Nui. Hakann discovers the Spear of Fusion, and uses it on Vezok, dividing him into two beings, Vezok and Vezon (the latter taking his name as Vezon means \"double\" in Matoran). They encounter Teridax's essence as \"Antidermis\", who subconsciously plants in their minds the ideato go to Voya Nui for the Kanohi Ignika. The seven escape the lair as his Mana Ko come after them. They flee to the island of Mata Nui after Vezon gives them the slip, and find the Toa Mata's Toa Canisters, bringing them to the beach. Avak and Zaktan chart a course to Voya Nui and Zaktan informs the Piraka to masquerade as Toa on their arrival. Hakann uses his heat vision to create a small puncture in Vezok's canister as they depart, although this act fails to kill him.\n\n\"Present\":\n\nThe Piraka continue down the hall of 777 stairs to the Kanohi Ignika, and surmise that Vezon awaits them as they found another Toa Canister upon Voya Nui on their arrival. Zaktan lets Hakann lead the way, as he is plagued by the laughter of Teridax within his mind. Meanwhile, Avak discovers Hakann cowering in a corner, his armor gleaming with intense heat.\n\nThe passages to the Kanohi Ignika's chamber are littered with traps and tests to keep the mask out of the wrong hands. The Piraka quickly face their greatest fears in the form of the mythical monster Irnakk. Only Zaktan's willingness to end his own cursed existence and everyone else's lives, thereby eliminating the fear that brought Irnakk to life and sustains him, allows the Piraka to pass the test and continue. In a later test, the Piraka fail due to their inability to trust one another; while they escape the resulting deathtrap they end up exposed to something that begins changing them...\n\nMeanwhile, the Toa Inika have their own tests to worry about. They soon come across a group of enemies that they had fought in their former Matoran lives, including a Rahkshi Turahk that had once killed Jaller during his search for the Toa of Light. Jaller is able to overcome this disturbing memory, but like all the other Inika, his powers go out of control and end up killing his opponent. Adding to their shame and grief at being killers, the bodies change to look like their old friends, the Toa Nuva. While worried that such things could happen again, they decide that the stakes are too high to abandon their quest. However, before the Toa Inika go on they turn to take one last look at the slain Toa Nuva, only to see that the bodies had disappeared. They then realise that the dead Toa Nuva, as well their earlier foes, were merely illusions.\n\nIn their next test, the Toa Inika are trapped and told they must sacrifice one of their own to continue. With his last death still on his mind, Jaller is distracted long enough for Matoro to volunteer himself, on the grounds that he as a translator has less to offer their mission than the others and becomes another foreshadow to the Barrakki story. This sacrifice is accepted and Matoro is disintegrated - only to be re-formed moments later, as the willingness to die for the cause was what was important, not the death itself.\n\nAfter this, the Toa Inika face Umbra, a guardian of the mask who uses super-speed to attack. Matoro is once again key to passing the test, as he uses his ice power to make Umbra slip and crash. As Umbra turns into a beam of light and becomes even faster, he eventually hits the ice and rebounds around the frozen cave until he is knocked out, making it easy to obtain the mask.\n\nAs both groups converge on the Mask of Life, the Piraka are a little bit ahead and they set an ambush, with the Toa Inika ending up trapped and delayed. The Piraka enter the mask's chamber to find that Vezon had arrived far ahead of all of them, and has since been fused to a Fenrakk spider and to the Mask of Life itself. As the Piraka prepare to take the mask by any means necessary, Vezon uses his spear to fuse Vezok and Reidak together, ordering the resulting beast to crush the others. By the time the Inika arrive, Vezok and Reidak are back to normal and all six are knocked out.\n\nWhile all this is happening, Brutaka wakes up in the Piraka's stronghold under Axonn's watch. While Axonn extends an offer of friendship to his old partner, Brutaka rejects it and attacks. In the course of the battle, he tries to get an edge by summoning a dimensional gate to warp Axonn away. Eventually, Axonn accepts that Brutaka will never be redeemed, and he becomes unstoppable in his anger. Brutaka tries to get to the Piraka's antidermis, which could enhance his strength, but Axonn shatters the vat before blasting Brutaka into unconsciousness. Once this is done, Botar arrives to banish Brutaka for his crimes, though Axonn still expresses hope for his redemption. After all leave the stronghold, Krahka and Tahtorak use Brutaka's portal to escape their exile (which began a thousand years ago in Bionicle Adventures).\n\nAs the Toa Inika fight Vezon and Fenrakk, the latter's ability to absorb kinetic energy is proving too much for the heroes; even when the Toa figure out how to weaken the two without hitting them, Fenrakk can just tap his leg on the ground to regain his and Vezon's strength. Eventually, the Toa are able to drive Fenrakk towards the chamber's lava, and Vezon surprisingly encourages him to dive in. As Jaller prepares to go after the mask, Vezon reemerges, with his steed evolved into an even more formidable dragon called Kardas. Needing a plan of attack other than direct assault, the Toa guess that the Mask of Life may have life and thoughts of its own, and Kongu attempts to use his Mask of Telepathy to read the mask's mind. He finds that the mask has grown to despise Vezon, and would happily abandon the madman in favor of a new, nobler guardian - Matoro. When Vezon learns of this he becomes enraged, allowing Jaller to use Axonn's Zamor Sphere. The sphere freezes Vezon and Kardas in space and time, allowing the mask to be removed safely.\n\nUnfortunately, the Piraka have recovered by now, and they aren't about to let the mask go without a fight. But the mask has other plans; as Kardas makes Matoro lose his grip on it, it flies away towards the surface. As the Toa Inika are able to get a small head start following it, Vezok is dead set on re-fusing with Vezon; but the other Piraka smash the Spear of Fusion to ensure that Vezok will never be whole again.\n\nBack on the surface, the Mask of Life dives into the sea. Hahli tries to follow it, but the depths become too deep for her to handle. As she loses consciousness, a Mahri Nui Matoran dives from below and helps her up to the surface, though at the cost of his own life. Before passing on, he pleads with the Toa to help a city beneath the sea.\n\nBut in the midst of the Toa Inika's mourning the Matoran, they are reunited with all their friends: the Matoran had succeeded in freeing the Toa Nuva, and Axonn is there as well (Botar had just left after talking to the Nuva). While the Inika worry that the Nuva will take over the mission to save the Great Spirit, the Nuva recognize that this mission is the Inika's destiny and give them their full blessing. Axonn also declares his intent to be the Matoran's guardian; openly instead of secretly this time. The Piraka, watching from afar, decide that taking on twelve Toa and Axonn would be suicide; opting to bide their time.\n\nSoon afterward, the Toa depart on their new missions which are revealed on the web: the Toa Nuva go on a mysterious quest that they have not told the Inika about, and the Toa Inika enter a secret passageway (opened by Axonn) leading to the underwater world where the Mask of Life now resides...\n\nFar beneath the ocean surrounding Voya Nui, the sunken city of Mahri Nui survives surrounded by mysterious predators. As its Matoran plan the defenses for the month, an inventor named Defilak suggests a scouting expedition to learn more about whatever is preying on Mahri Nui. As he does this, the sentry Kyrehx finds and claims a sinking Kanohi mask, never aware that she is being watched...\n\nBy the time Kyrehx brings the mask to the planning meeting, it has already been adjourned. She instead seeks out someone knowledgeable about Kanohi, but is soon caught and attacked by the very seaweed beneath her feet. She is saved from the plants by Dekar, and she is happy to pass the strange mask off to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Defilak has gathered a crew for his home-built submarine: Gar, Idris, and Sarda. As they descend into unknown territory, they are soon attacked and trapped by a school of Takea sharks, who are led by a bigger, shark-like being who is named Pridak. After the submarine is destroyed, Pridak demands the Mask of Life from the crew and throws Sarda to the sharks when they claim ignorance. He explains that he is a Barraki, one of six warlords banished to the Pit millennia ago for their crimes. Sarda is subsequently saved by the arrival of Toa Lesovikk.\n\nThe other Barraki, however, have their own plans concerning the mask: Takadox has Carapar kidnap Kyrehx, and from her tale realizes that the mask is the legendary Mask of Life. He also sends Carapar to return Kyrehx and stop Ehlek, who has gathered his venom eel army and launched an all-out assault on Mahri Nui.\n\nIn the meantime, Dekar has found that every enemy he fights has become immortal and invincible. Realizing that his and Kyrehx's strange curses come from the mask, he decides that it is too dangerous to exist. When Dekar tries to destroy the mask - as the remaining two Barraki, Kalmah and Mantax close in on him - it defends itself by enlarging a nearby venom eel to giant size.\n\nThe eel begins to attack everything in sight. As Defilak, Gar, and Idris use the chance to escape from Pridak and his sharks; Ehlek and Carapar take the opportunity to snoop around Pridak's lair, where they find a newcomer to the Pit - the mutated Brutaka. Takadox tries to hypnotize the eel into submission, but it becomes distracted by sounds in a long cord of stone that reaches to the surface and it knocks Takadox far away. Dekar, now with a healthy respect for the mask, cautiously touches it and is given a vision of its history, along with the revelation that the Pit's waters are eroding it away and damaging it.\n\nBy this time, Pridak has gathered the Barraki, with Brutaka in place of the missing Takadox. As they confront Dekar, Brutaka demands he hand over the mask, swearing that an Order of Mata Nui member such as himself would never let the Barraki have it. When Dekar refuses, saying one who should have the mask would have claimed it himself, the Barraki mock Brutaka for his \"lies\" about an Order and command a giant squid to drag him off. They then step over to Dekar and take the mask from him, causing it to release a blinding light.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toa Inika are inside the Cord locked in combat with the Zyglak. The light hits them, and they are transformed into the Toa Mahri. At the same time, Dekar is transformed into a duplicate of the former protector of the Pit, Hydraxon.\n\nAt the same time the Barraki deliver the damaged Kanohi Ignika to Nocturn to keep it safe, the Toa Mahri knock the 300-foot (91 m) venom eel unconscious, and head for Mahri Nui. However, the Matoran there are frightened and uncertain about the new arrivals, and open fire on the Toa. Toa Mahri Kongu then creates a gust of wind to blow Defilak out of the air bubble, while Toa Mahri Hahli creates a whirlpool, trapping the Matoran. Then Hahli releases him, and states that if she wanted to harm him, she would have done so. Still needing to be convinced, Defilak asks five of the Toa Mahri to rescue Matoro. Arriving at the fields, the other Toa Mahri are captured by the Barraki, and attempt to lull them into a false sense of security by masquerading as Toa sent to the Pit for incarceration. Matoro is captured by the newly reincarnated Hydraxon.\n\nHydraxon takes Matoro to the Pit, where he his placed under the watch of the guard robot Maxilos. Matoro's predicament worsens when he learns that Maxilos has become the new body of Teridax, the Makuta of Metru Nui. Teridax frees Matoro, forcing him to ally with him without revealing his identity to the other Toa Mahri. The others, taken to prison caves by the Barraki, escape through the use of their new mask powers; Kongu's summons a giant sea creature, which ends up getting into a battle with the revived 300-foot (91 m) venom eel. All the Toa Mahri then return to Mahri Nui, where the others are introduced to Maxilos. Honored by Defilak by being offered the group name Toa Mahri, the six and Maxilos set out to divide the Barraki against each other. Luckily, their efforts prove successful, and the Barraki and their armies begin clashing. Afterwards, however, the Toa are shocked to learn that Mantax's army of rays is approaching Mahri Nui with Hahli at its head.\n\nMeanwhile, Hydraxon had just defeated Nocturn, who had been entrusted with the Ignika by Pridak. He approached the Mask of Life, conflicted as to whether take someplace secure (his first instinct) or destroy it (unconsciously triggered by Dekar's memory). He eventually decided to destroy it and opened fire.\n\nMeanwhile, as Hydraxon tries to destroy the Ignika, the mask is knocked out of the way by Hahli, and Mantax quickly grabs it. After the Toa Mahri reunite with Hahli, they learn from Matoro that they need to destroy the stone cord linking Voya Nui and Mahri Nui and save the Matoran of both islands from the resulting crash. To do so, they travel back up through the cord and hide the Matoran of Voya Nui and Mahri Nui. However, they deal with the Piraka (now mutated into snake-like forms), before being saved by Axonn, who hides the Matoran in caverns on Voya Nui. Before the Toa Mahri leave, Axonn provides them with a living vehicle, the Toa Terrain Crawler, to take them back to Mahri Nui. In time for the battle, Jaller burns Mantax severely, causing him to drop the mask for the Toa to retrieve it when Hydraxon interferes. Hewkii confronts and fights Gadunka, and quickly defeats him by sending volts of electricity into him. Matoro Mahri soon finds Maxilos and freezes him, but is soon set free due to a blast of fire from Jaller that missed Hydraxon. Maxilos and Spinax, now a team, fights Hydraxon, while the Toa get ready to destroy the cord. Before they can, however, Gadunka returns with new allies. The 300-foot (91 m) eel, and the monster Kongu summoned. After a 40-second battle with them, they destroy the cord, bringing Voya Nui crashing down onto Mahri Nui, just as the Barraki come. Matoro feels the mask being pulled in the wake of Voya Nui when suddenly, every creature stops, feeling cold inside. Matoro then looks at the now grey mask, and proclaims that the Great Spirit has died.\n\nKnowing that a moment cannot be spared, Matoro leaves his fellow Mahri, and quickly swims with Voya Nui to its place of origin. Meanwhile, the furious Barraki arrive, and have an all-out battle against the five remaining Mahri, and plot to send their armies after Matoro. Meanwhile, Hydraxon, seeing all that has happened, discovers a destroyed Maxilos, with the Spirit of Teridax missing (which will rock the foundation of the Toa's lives once they discover where he is). Matoro beats Voya Nui and descends into the Universe Core, nearly being crushed by the landmass above. There, the sentient Ignika speaks, and informs him to don the Mask of Life, which Matoro accepts as his destiny. The entirety of his life, from Matoran to Toa, flashes, and Matoro realizes that this was where he must be in the end. However, he used his last bit of will to save his friends. His body is then transformed into fierce raw energy, and revives the Great Spirit Mata Nui in a massive explosion.\n\nAs the battle between the Toa Mahri and the Barraki rages, a sudden change of events occurs; the Mahri are instantly transported back to Metru Nui, able to breathe air, where Turaga Vakama awaits, informing them of Matoro's deed and of his death. But in their hearts, he will never be truly gone, he is now part of the universe, having transcended to a higher state of being.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toa Nuva are sent to Artakha, a paradise island, and are given new armor, masks, and weapons. Artakha then teleports the Toa Nuva to Karda Nui, telling them to fulfill their destiny and to wake Mata Nui.\n\nNote that the events of Shadows in the Sky, and Swamp of Secrets both take place at the same time, with the exception of the second part of Swamp of Secrets.\n\nOne week before the ending of \"Downfall\", in Karda Nui, Tanma and Gavla were assigned to adjusting the \"Scare-Rahi\" (apparently a scarecrow-like object used for keeping away flying Rahi from the Matoran village) when Tanma noticed a large black flying creature heading for where Gavla was. When he went to help her, he discovered that she was different. She had been hit with a leech-like creature, and mutated into a monstrous form. She had become the first of the Av-Matoran to have her light drained and become a Shadow Matoran.\n\nIn the following week, Kirop, the leader of the Av-Matoran, became corrupted, along with many others. Even Radiak, hero of the Av-Matoran, succumbed to the attack of the enemies, who Kirop revealed to be members of the Brotherhood of Makuta before his corruption. All of the Av-Matoran villages fell save one, where the remaining uncorrupted Matoran were sheltering at the time of Mata Nui's death.\n\nMinutes after the tragic event, Tanma noticed a white Toa falling down the waterfall and there was suddenly a gigantic explosion of light, blinding the three attacking Makuta (Antroz, Vamprah, and Chirox) and bringing the Great Spirit back to life. Likely Tanma ordered all the other Matoran to duck and close their eyes.\n\nA few hours later the Av-Matoran waged a battle against the Makuta and the Shadow Matoran in the sky. And as they did so, the Toa Nuva arrived in Karda Nui, teleported there by Artakha from the island with the same name.\n\nAs soon as the Toa Nuva Arrived, Pohatu rush to engage the Makuta in battle. Wise Onua was the one that noticed that the bat-like Makuta were blind. The Toa helped the Matoran finish the fight and regrouped at the village, where they began to remember that they once lived in Karda Nui. They discovered the use of their new weapons, which they named Midak Skyblasters. (Midak was the name of a strange Onu-Matoran of Metru Nui who liked the light despite being able to see better in the dark, and Toa Nuva Lewa had always wanted a weapon called a \"Skyblaster\", and none of the other Toa cared to object, thus the name was created.)\n\nMeanwhile, in the Makuta's Shadow Leech hive, Mutran and Vican were working on a new experiment, a Rahi that could turn into a liquid when disturbed. Mutran \"kept slipping in it\" and ordered Vican to get rid of it. He kicked it out of the hive and it fell into the swamp below. Vican decided not to tell Mutran that the creature \"doesn't fall, it flew.\"\n\nVamprah arrived at the hive and forced Mutran to come to the main Makuta lair to create a flying Rahi to take Vican to Destral to summon Icarax. He created a part-Rahi and part-Matoran creature, and sent Vican off to Destral.\n\nBack at the Av-Matoran's village, the Toa Nuva learned of Matoro's death from the Av-Matoran's description of the events leading up to the blinding flash of light. From this they realized that the Mask of Life that Matoro was last seen with was probably in the swamp below. Tahu, Gali, and Onua departed for the swamp and Lewa, Pohatu, and Kopaka stayed to defend the Matoran. Tahu leading one group and Kopaka leading the other.\n\nLater, an Av-Matoran who looked up to the Toa, named Solek, approached Kopaka and gave him part of an object called a Keystone. It was a tablet detailing how to awaken Mata Nui from his endless slumber, but it had been broken into six pieces. According to Solek, the Makuta held two pieces (one held by Kirop), and the locations of the other three were unknown. Kopaka, understanding all that these Matoran have been through, spoke kindly to him and gave him inspiration for the battle to come, using how Takua became a Toa as an example. It was then that Kopaka learned that Solek knew Takua.\n\nThe next day, Lewa happened to knock Kirop out of the sky in battle. Kopaka captured him and with Lewa's help, led him to believe the Toa would be launching an attack on the Shadow Leech hive in a few hours. Kirop found a way out and escaped to the Shadow Leech hive, exactly as the Toa had planned. They followed him, along with Tanma, Solek, and another Av-Matoran named Photok.\n\nIn the swamp at the bottom of Karda Nui, the Mask of Life pondered whether or not to create some more guardians for it. But recalling the failures of others like Hydraxon and the gigantic Venom Eel, it decided to create a body for itself, so it could have friends like its former guardian, Matoro.\n\nIt also created itself a Skyboard. It flew into the skies above and began silently following Kopaka and the others as the trailed Kirop. He (now considering itself male) proved itself by saving the Toa from a hostile flying Rahi by speeding up its life, killing it. The Toa did not notice another flying Rahi escape through the Makuta's portal into Karda Nui, with Vican riding it, heading for Destral.\n\nWhen the Toa arrived in the Shadow Leech hive, they found no leeches, and just Mutran instead. Kopaka and Solek hung back to take on Mutran, while the others headed further into the hive, which seemed to be bigger on the inside than it was in the outside. They reached a dead-end, and when they turned around to see if Toa Ignika was still behind them, they found that in his place was a gigantic monster. Without worrying about whether it was hostile or not, Tanma (and the others soon afterwards) jumped into battle.\n\nThey did not realize that this was an illusion put up by Mutran, and that this monster was actually Toa Ignika. Confused and enraged as to why the Toa were attacking him, he decided to use his Life powers to kill the Toa and their Matoran friends. But eventually the illusion faded and the Toa were able to disrupt Toa Ignika's attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Mutran had attempted to tear Kopaka's mind to pieces, and Kopaka led him to believe he had succeeded, until eventually he turned the tides of the battle and froze Mutran in a blast of ice and snow. It was then that Antroz, Chirox, and Vamprah arrived and quickly defeated Kopaka and captured the heroes. The Toa were chained to a wall, and the Matoran were left in another chamber. Antroz warned the Toa that if they made one hostile move, he would send a mental message to Vamprah and Chirox who were with the Matoran to immediately kill them.\n\nPohatu collapsed the floor below the Makuta and used his Mask of Speed to race to the chamber with the Matoran before Vamprah and Chirox killed them. He returned with the Matoran, and the Makuta not far behind. Pohatu shared his mask power with the others and the heroes sped around the chamber too fast to be seen and then escaped. Toa Ignika, using his life power, destroyed the organic stone cord holding the hive up and causing it to fall into the swamp.\n\nVican arrived on Destral before long, and delivered the message to Icarax, who was now wearing Makuta Teridax's Mask of Shadow and sitting on his throne. Though enraged that Antroz was giving him orders, Icarax decided to come and them ordered Vican to tell Antroz that Icarax was not to be ordered around.\n\nBy the time Icarax had arrived, the final battle had begun. The Makuta laid siege to the Matoran village...only to find that there were no Matoran there. The Toa Nuva and the Matoran were in the Makuta's base, searching for the third keystone.\n\nWhen the Makuta went after them, a battle occurred. In the end, Mutran used the equivalent of a Nova Blast of Shadow. Icarax had earlier sent Antroz into the swamp, and Toa Ignika had made Icarax into a biomechanical being once more by de-evolving him. And after the Nova Blast, Chirox, Vamprah, and Icarax were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe Toa withstood the blast, and Mutran was forced to surrender. The Toa headed into the swamp to meet up with their friends.\n\nBut elsewhere, Makuta Teridax's energy floated through an unknown location...a location that would \"rock the Toa's universe\" to discover. It was a place heavily guarded, but Teridax easily crossed, having no body and being only a cloud of energy. He located his goal, a carving of a Kanohi Hau, and set about his final goal, to accomplish his destiny.\n\nMeanwhile, Takanuva was patrolling the beaches of Metru Nui. He begins wondering if things would have been better for Matoro and Toa Mahri if he had been there. A dark thought flutters in his head for a moment, but he quickly expels it. Pushing forward with his mental energy, Takanuva picks up a picture of a Dark Hunter in the Archives. The Toa of Light races toward the Archives in Onu-Metru, but he is taken by surprise at the sudden attack of a Shadow Leech. After a struggle to get it off, he succeeds, but not before being halfway drained of his light and knocked unconscious.\n\nTakanuva wakes up in a room in the Archives where the Onu-Matoran bring dead Rahi bodies for inspection. Illuminating the cave, he notices two Toa standing over him, one Toa of Water, and a Toa of Sonics. The Toa of Water calls herself Helryx, while the Toa of Sonics is Krakua. She explains that they have a message that Takanuva must deliver to the Toa Nuva. Before he leaves, though, Helryx latches her 'pet' Kratana onto Takanuva's Kanohi so he can learn of the past.\n\nMeanwhile, the other three Toa Nuva land in the Swamp of Secrets. They decide to split up, and Onua comes across a giant Nui-Kopen. Slamming it with his fist, it falls into the swamp water, and emerges as a completely different looking creature with tentacles. Before it attacks, Onua's body suddenly does not listen to his will, and he witnesses a yellow Makuta approach him. Bitil explains that his Nynrah Ghost Blaster took over Onua's mechanical parts in his body, then summons duplicates of himself, and they take Onua, who is under their control, to Krika's lair for interrogation. In another part of the swamp, Tahu encounters an enormous spherical structure embedded in a fallen stalactite. He approaches it, but is abruptly blown back by an invisible energy field, and a white Makuta looms over him and prepares to feed.\n\nIn Takanuva's visions of the past, he witnesses the Toa Mata being awoken and spoken to by Helryx. After questions are exchanged and hot arguments are quelled, they are led outside of the room they are in, only to be taught more about what Toa are meant to do in their life.\n\nBack in the swamp, Bitil had arrived at Krika's cave. Onua silently realizes that he is no longer under control by Bitil, and quickly gets one duplicate into a headlock. Threatening to tear the Makuta's head off, the other Bitils blast him with energy. Onua rises to see fifty Bitils before him, and he then makes the Earth explode beneath them. His concentration broke, only one Bitil pursues the escaping Onua, who uses his Nynrah Ghost Blaster to create an energy field around Bitil, sending him falling down to the swamp.\n\nIn yet another part of the swamp, Gali finds a broken Keystone in the grasp of a sentient plant. After successfully retrieving it, she is attacked by Gorast, who stuns her. After a short, furious fight, Gali traps Gorast in a mud sinkhole. Gorast seemingly commits suicide by drowning herself, but she shortly bursts from the ground and defeats Gali. A huge fireball then illuminates the sky.\n\nTahu struggles getting up and then rolls away from Krika's grasp. Krika then explains to Tahu why Makuta hate Toa so much, and that is why he must die. Tahu then succumbs to a sudden cold that sweeps over him, and with one final effort, launches an enormous fireball into the sky.\n\nBack in Takanuva's visions, Gali is knocked flat by her trainer, Hydraxon, after being defeated countless times before. She then goes into a short frenzy in a wild effort to defeat him, but fails. She gets up, ready to strike again, but then is knocked down by Spinax. She then finds her way back to the Toa Mata's rest station, and engages in discussion with several of the other Toa.\n\nIn the present, right before feeding on Gali's light, Gorast is picked up by Onua and slammed into the ground so hard she almost snaps into pieces. Gali turns out to be all right, and Onua and her escape, Gorast and Bitil wildly on their tails. They eventually arrive at the scene of Tahu's dismay, and a short battle ensues. Chirox, another Makuta, is seen falling out of the sky, and the other three rush to help him, leaving the three Toa Nuva alone. They are guided deeper in the swamp by an Av-Matoran who had appeared to help them escape. They eventually arrive at a small ground surrounded by Lightvines. The Nuva are horrified by what they see in the middle: Matoran-like forms are undergoing strange changes. Suddenly, the forms change into Bohrok, leaving the Toa puzzled. The Av-Matoran explains that the first Bohrok had evolved from Av-Matoran, and the transformations came naturally. Gali takes her eyes off of the robots for a moment, and when she looks back, they are gone. The Matoran guide hands Onua a Keystone, and then lies down and transforms into a Bohrok, and disappears like his other brothers. Tahu then expresses his subtle rage toward the fact that that was the price to be paid for Mata Nui's awakening.\n\nIn Takanuva's visions, he sees Lewa underwater, attempting to find his Miru. Frustrated from the attacks of carnivorous schools of fish, he gives up, and Hydraxon laughs at him. Their trainer had taken each of their masks and hidden it somewhere on Daxia. Angered, Lewa comments on how each of the other Toa Mata are doing, then realizes that they can work together. Hydraxon commends him, and Lewa seeks out Gali's help for getting his mask, in exchange for him getting her mask. After the mask search, Tahu and Kopaka scale a mountain to get to an Order of Mata Nui base. They then trick the guards into letting them in, and they are greeted by Helryx, the leader of the Order. She stops working on her project, the Swamp Strider, and then asks them if they will take on the job to become Mata Nui's guardians.\n\nIn the present, Tahu and the two other Toa follow a trail created by the Makuta toward Krika's base. They plan a strategy to steal the final Keystone. Once arriving there, they cause timed explosions of their elements to happen. Each explosion goes right, and each Makuta is distracted out of the lair. Seizing the opportunity, the Toa steal the Keystone, and Tahu throws a shield around them from the attack of the non-tricker Krika. Onua digs a huge hole and the Nuva follow it, planning to escape to the Codrex, where they will wait for the other three Toa. Krika and his team follow, planning to ambush the Toa. It turns out the Nuva were the ones planning the ambush. Above the Codrex, they witness the three Makuta and three more Bitils appear, waiting for them. Tahu then lead the two other Nuva in a power dive towards the Makuta in a last attempt to defeat them.\n\nIn Takanuva's visions, he witnesses the Toa Mata in Karda Nui, and Kopaka and Tahu fighting off a group of Avohkah. After they are defeated, Tahu and Kopaka debate whether or not they should tell the other Mata the truth about the Codrex and what it is meant for.\n\nBack in the present, a furious battle breaks out against the two teams in the swamp. Eventually, the Toa gain the upper hand, but not before Antroz and his Makuta team come flying down, and prepare to fire at the Nuva. All hope seems lost, when suddenly, an ice blast blocks the blast of energy Antroz fires, backfiring on him. Kopaka, the three Av-Matoran, and the other two Toa soar down, ready to join the fight. Tahu and his team smile as they charge back into the fight, ready for the final battle.\n\nIn Takanuva's last vision, Gali defeats the last Avohkah. While Tahu and Kopaka congratulate the team, the final Av-Matoran, Takua, leaves Karda Nui with his friends. While they did that, Tahu and Kopaka led their team to the Codrex. Curious as to what it is, Lewa runs to it, only to be blasted away by the energy field. They insert the Keystone into a niche inside the Codrex's energy field, and enter it. Tahu then closes the entrance, and the Mata witness a huge energy storm brewing inside Karda Nui. Tahu explains what their destinies are, and the other four Toa Mata are outraged by Kopaka and the Toa of Fire for not telling them. Tahu also explains that if they don't get into the six canisters lined up in the Codrex, the storm would kill them all. The team reluctantly enters their canisters, ready for the day that they must awaken.\n\nThe Kratana is forcefully ripped off of Takanuva's face, and the Toa of Light then asks how he will go to Karda Nui soon enough. At that moment, Brutaka enters the room, holding the Dark Hunter Dweller in his hands. He then activates his damaged Olmak, and Takanuva steps through the portal, ready to begin his trip to Karda Nui.\n\nAfter passing through the portal made by Brutaka, Takanuva soon exits through another portal and falls out of the sky, and into a different, pocket dimension, which is the City of Silver Pocket Dimonsion. He had ended up here, because Brutaka's Mask of Dimensional Gates was damaged, thus causing its power to malfunction, which resulted in Takanuva to wind up in the wrong place. When Takanuva lands, he finds himself in a dark forest, and soon comes across the Spectral Mask. At first, Takanuva believes he is hallucinating, as masks normally do not talk. His thoughts, however, do not seem to be acknowledged by the Mask, who talks about its relief of Takanuva's arrival and informs Takanuva of trouble in a nearby village. Without hearing what caused the trouble, Takanuva quickly walks off to help the village.\n\nWhen Takanuva arrives at the village, he sees a large group of Kestora fighting against a large, monster-like creature (City-Building Creature). Thinking that the creature is the source of the commotion (and trouble), Takanuva quickly assaults the creature and drives it off. Turning back to the Kestoras, he expects applause and thanks, but instead, he finds himself being laughed at and locked out of the village.\n\nDistressed, Takanuva goes back into the forest and finds the Mask. He informs it of what happened, and the Mask, shocked, tells him that the members of the creature's species are actually the peaceful inhabitants of the village, and they had been driven out of their city by the Kestoras. It also informs Takanuva that the one he fought off was the last one residing in the village. Takanuva, quickly noting his mistake, runs off to find the creature and apologize. He succeeds, and together they hatch a plan to steal back the city.\n\nAt night, Takanuva stations himself outside the village and shoots fireworks into the sky. The Kestoras quickly swarm out of the village, and watch the fireworks in fascination. While they watch and enjoy themselves, the creature burrows back to the city and seals the gates, locking the Kestoras out and reclaiming the village.\n\nHaving finally accomplished his task, Takanuva goes back to the Mask, who congratulates him and opens a portal. Takanuva enters it, and is transported once more into another dimensional voyage in The Kingdom Alternate Universe, which is told in The Kingdom short story. The events of the final journey of Takanuva, including how he got to Karda Nui, are told in the Dark Mirror short story.\n\nThe fight between the Toa Nuva and the blind and mutated Makuta rages on in the swamp. Krika deals a heavy blow that stuns Gali, and he carries her deeper into the swamp. While there, Krika claims that if the Toa awaken Mata Nui, a horrible future will come to pass, so Gali must leave to prevent that. No sooner than when those words left the Makuta's mouth, a powerful blast of light flew across Krika's face. He looked skyward to find the worst fear of the Brotherhood of Makuta: Takanuva, the legendary Toa of Light, with his power lance still aimed at the Makuta, ready to destroy his armor. Krika retreated into the swamp. Gali, confused at the Toa's transformation, wanted answers, only to be told to wait until the Toa were assembled. Pohatu arrived shortly after and remarked on Takanuva's new coloration. When the trio arrived at the Codrex, there was a great battle between the Toa and Makuta. Fortunately, Takanuva arrived from the Space Between Dimensions, using the deceased Dark Mirrors Demension's Brutaka's Mask of Dimensional Gates, and manages to drive off the Makuta Krika, who was menacing Gali, with his Power Lance. A soon as the Toa were reassembled, Ignika (now able to speak) arrived. Ignika quickly reported that he was on a countdown to the elimination of everything in the Universe. He told of how he was forged, and that the Great Beings intended him as a failsafe if the universe ever went wrong. Takanuva then reported that when the Toa reawaken Mata Nui, a massive energy storm will erupt in Karda Nui, and destroy everyone and everything in the cavern. No sooner than when he finished the report, the Makuta returned, and a massive battle erupted once more. The Toa rushed to fit the keystones they retrieved into the Codrex. With the energy field down, they entered the complex, unaware that Antroz was silently following them. Before the other Makuta could get in, Tahu retrieved the keystones to raise the energy field once more. Inside the Codrex, the Toa Nuva discovered niches in the floor, similar in size and shape to the canisters that they used to make their way to the island of Mata Nui. Onua hit a button on a nearby console, and the floor slid down to a cavern far below. The niches were then replaced by large light stones, and three metal cocoons erupted from the floor. The cocoons then disappeared, leaving behind three vehicles. Then Antroz sprang from the shadows into the cockpit of one of the ships, the Jetrax T6. His mind merged with the ship, allowing him to see through the ship's sensors. Lewa and Pohatu both jumped aboard the Axalara T9 and Rockoh T3, and pursued Antroz out of the Codrex. Outside the Codrex, Takanuva meets up with Tanma and Photok, and they dragged Radiak into the swamp, unaware that they are being followed by Kirop, Chirox, and Bitil (with his past selves). Vamprah, Gavla and Gorast had gone to track down Icarax, as had Tahu, Solek and Ignika, and Krika and Mutran had vanished. Mutran's assistant, the Shadow Matoran Vican, meets Takanuva, Photok, Radiak and Tanma. He reports that the scream of a klakk shattered the hold shadow had over him, and he no longer served the Makuta. Takanuva, seeing the truth in his eyes, began search for the klakk. Ironically, Radiak was the one to find the creature. He attacked the rahi, intent on destroying it, but the ceature's cry broke the shadow spell. Although Radiak's mental state was restored, his armor, mask, and elemental ability remained as when he was fully in shadow. Radiak then reported the Makuta actually wanted Mata Nui to awaken for reasons he did not know. Takanuva ordered the four Matoran to leave Karda Nui before the energy storm erupted, but as they left, Takanuva was attacked by Chirox, Kirop, and seven incarnations of Bitil. Under the sway of shadow, he lost control to rage and started attacking them all, taunting them that their greatest wish, a Toa of Shadow, was now in existence and they could choke on the knowledge he was not theirs, and declaring that this battle would not be a Kolhii masquerade; that any Makuta that got near him would die. He blasted a hole in Chirox's armor and charged into the midst of the Makuta, never noticing one of the Bitils was about to strike him down. Meanwhile, Antroz fought Pohatu, Lewa and Kopaka in a battle on board vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Takanuva was locked in combat with Chirox and Bitil. A bolt of light fired by Kopaka aboard the Jetrax stunned Bitil, causing him to lose focus on his mask and the time clones created by his mask to disappear. Before Takanuva could destroy Chirox though, Kopaka brought him to his senses, allowing the Makuta to flee. Takanuva reported to Kopaka what he had learned from Radiak, and Kopaka left aboard the Jetrax to warn the other Toa Nuva. Takanuva resumed his search for Matoran and came across Gavla. He managed to put himself and the Matoran in the path of the Klakk's scream, and the mental shadow dissolved in both of them. Takanuva told Gavla to leave, for her to join the other Matoran.\n\nIcarax and Krika try to sabotage the plan, by destroying the Codrex. Because of this, Gorast and Vamprah convinced Icarax to teleport, by telling him the plan is working. Fueled by his desires for the plan to fail so he can take over the world, he falls for the trick. Then Gorast disrupts his teleportation power making parts of him scatter all over the universe. Krika escapes for now.\n\nThe Toa Nuva reveal that the Lightstones that come up from the canisters resting spot are the key to awaking Mata Nui, They figure out that Ignika could awaken the Great Spirit by removing his mask and placing it in the center of the Codrex. However, in doing so Ignika would have to sacrifice his life as a Toa, something he has vowed never to do, and he tries to destroy them when he hears the news. However, when Matoro and how he gave his life to save the entire universe is mentioned, Ignika finally decides to sacrifice himself.\n\nOutside the Codrex, Tahu and Gorast are fighting. Krika comes to warn Gorast that an energy storm will kill them all, but she is so bent on killing him for trying to ruin the plan, she doesn't listen. She disrupts his power to turn intangible, and he becomes nothing.\n\nJust then, the energy storm began. As Takanuva flew to the western portal, he noticed Mutran attempting to control the storm. His life was ended as the energy incinerated his armor and his essence. Takanuva, without regret for not trying to save the Makuta, flew away to join the Toa Nuva.\n\nMeanwhile, Gorast could only stare at the storm, shocked by the betrayal of her idol. Antroz tries to convince all the Makuta that they must try to escape, but Bitil tries to abandon his fellow Makuta. He fails, and all of the remaining Makuta are killed. The Toa Nuva and Takanuva use the vehicles to escape Karda Nui.\n\nBack in Metru Nui, celebrations have begun. But just as Turaga Dume finished his victory speech, a shadow fell across the land, and the stars align into the Kanohi Kraahkan, Great Mask of Shadows. Teridax announces that when Mata Nui awakened, Teridax slipped into the Great Spirit's mind, possessing his body and banishing Mata Nui's mind into the Mask of Life (the only thing to escape the storm, teleported away to safety). Teridax tells the Toa that he has also banished the mask from the universe. He now is the Matoran universe, and the Toa have no hope of defeating him.\n\nThe book ends with the Mask of Life turning back to gold, and hurdling through the Bionicle Galaxy, the space between the \"universes.\" Within the mask, the voice of the Great Spirit vows, \"I will return,\" as the Mask of Life reaches a mysterious planet.\n\nThe book begins with Fero and Skirmix searching for prey out in the desert. Fero is about to leave when Skirmix indicates there is prey around. Fero spots a caravan, protected by Gelu, heading toward Tajun, and decides to pursue. Gelu reflects how the Skrall have slowly become more and more aggressive, finally attacking Atero. Gelu's Sand Stalker rears at the sight of a destroyed caravan, the site of a Bone Hunter raid. Gelu tells the Agori he is escorting that it is nothing to worry about. He then spots a Bone Hunter riding towards him and orders the Agori to flee and hide in a sandstorm. Gelu rides up to meet Fero, and the two engage in battle. The Ice Tribe Glatorian is able to knock Fero off of his steed, but the Bone Hunter quickly recovers and aims his Thornax Launcher at Gelu, ordering him to get off his Sand Stalker and toss his Thornax Launcher away. The Glatorian does so, and, after a brief sword fight, Gelu gains the upper hand and defeats Fero, discovering a map of modern Vulcanus in the Bone Hunter's possession. Gelu asks what it is, but Fero refuses to talk, even when the Glatorian threatens to kill Skirmix. Gelu leaves and catches up with the caravan, which had been raided by Zesk. Once the group resumes its journey, Gelu studies the map and realizes that it details the defenses of Vulcanus, even ones that were not there even a week ago, and that the map is not written in the Bone Hunter's language, but instead Agori. When Gelu and the Agori reach Tajun, the Glatorian meets up with Metus, who talks about Tajun and its Glatorian, and asks Gelu if he would be interested in fighting for the village. When Gelu declines, Metus says that he is on his way to Vulcanus with Gresh to fight against Ackar, and Gelu decides to travel to Vulcanus with them.\n\nAlong the way, the group runs into a caravan with a broken wheel. The Agori in the caravan are somewhat biased against Gelu, as a Glatorian of the Ice Tribe offered to help them earlier in exchange for half of their goods, due to the path ahead being filled with Vorox. Gresh offers to repair their wheel and escort them for free, much to objections of Metus. After the caravan is fixed, Gresh says that they should keep traveling despite it being nighttime, reasoning that they have a better chance of surviving a Vorox attack if they are moving rather than if they make camp. As they travel through the desert, they notice a Vorox about to attack them, and Gelu defeats it with a Thornax. A multitude of Vorox then begin to attack the two Glatorian, who are able to fend most of them off. When the Vorox become too much to handle, Gelu and Gresh decide to toss two pieces of new armor from the caravan in opposite directions, resulting in the Vorox fighting each other for the cargo, and the group is able to make it out of the pass safely. As they near Vulcanus, Gelu compliments Gresh on his fighting.\n\nAfter they reach their destination, the Agori apologize for judging the Glatorian so harshly, but Metus sends Gresh and Gelu off, stating that they are supposed to accept pay for helping. The two Glatorian eventually make it to the village inn of Vulcanus, where they talk about being a Glatorian and about the Core War. Gelu then spots Raanu, and excuses himself. The Ice Glatorian tells Raanu about the map, and they discuss the chances of survival against a Bone Hunter attack. Raanu suggests fleeing, but Gelu instead suggests assembling a group of Glatorian to defend the village. Raanu asks Gelu if he is going to lead the Glatorian, but Ackar, having overheard the conversation, says he will do it instead. The Fire Glatorian looks over the map and questions Gelu's idea, saying that Bone Hunters can cause great destruction. When Raanu asks if Ackar is saying they should flee, the Glatorian responds by saying that Gelu's plan is most likely the best choice. Gresh declares that he supports it, and Ackar orders him to go to Tesara and recruit some Glatorian. He also sends out two Glatorian trainees to Tajun to seek help there, and Gelu stays with Ackar.\n\nAckar instructs Raanu what to do if the Bone Hunters attack the village while the Glatorian are gone, then leaves with Gelu. The two Glatorian ride into the north, where Ackar explains he has to pick up a \"friend\" to aid in an attack on the Bone Hunter camp. Meanwhile, Gresh rides to Tesara, and on his way, he ponders the Skrall and Bone Hunters, and what they could do if they allied with each other. Elsewhere, Fero and four other Bone Hunters hear the two rookie Glatorian from Vulcanus. Fero orders the group to split up into two groups, planning to ambush and kill the Glatorian.\n\nAckar and Gelu cut to the west across the bed of the Skrall River, where Gelu notices telltale marks of Vorox in the sand. Ackar tells Gelu that they are heading for a cave inside a small mountain range when they are suddenly ambushed by Zesk and Vorox. Gelu reaches for his Thornax Launcher, but the Fire Glatorian stops him. Ackar calls for Malum, who is hiding in the cave. At hearing this, the Vorox begin murmuring among themselves. Ackar calls again, and Malum comes out of his cave. He asks the two Glatorian why they have come, and Ackar tells Malum that Vulcanus is in trouble. Malum refuses to help until Ackar reveals that the Bone Hunters are involved. Ackar then explains the situation, and Malum agrees to help.\n\nIn Tesara, Gresh goes to the arena, where Vastus is in a practice session. Vastus asks if Gresh's match was canceled, and Gresh tells Vastus the situation. Vastus refuses to help, saying that it could be a trick by the Bone Hunters, and states that he will not leave Tesara. Angered, Gresh leaves.\n\nElsewhere, Kiina and Tarix scan the Wastelands to investigate rumors of a herd of wild Rock Steeds. They instead find the bodies of the two rookie Glatorian sent from Vulcanus and a Bone Hunter sword buried in the sand nearby. Kiina offers to go to Vulcanus to tell them about the deaths of the Glatorian trainees, and Tarix says he will bury the two at Tajun.\n\nMeanwhile, Ackar, Gelu, and Malum go to the Bone Hunter camp, and at Malum's order, the Vorox attack and ambush the Bone Hunters. At first, the Vorox and Glatorian are able to defeat many Bone Hunters, but in the middle of the battle, one of them throws something on the fire and causes it to explode into a much larger blaze. The Bone Hunters gain the upper hand and manage to take down many Vorox, and the remaining Vorox, along with the Glatorian, retreat. They return to the cave, and Ackar asks if Malum could defend Vulcanus. He refuses, but wishes the two luck in the battle to come.\n\nIn Vulcanus, Raanu watches the Agori villagers work on the village defenses when Kiina arrives, telling Raanu about the deaths of the Glatorian trainees. Raanu then explains the situation to Kiina, and she tells Raanu to flee. Raanu objects to this, and the two argue. As they argue, they are interrupted by Gelu and Ackar. Gelu tells Raanu about the attack on the Bone Hunter camp while Ackar greets Kiina. Kiina asks Ackar why he is encouraging the village to fight the Bone Hunters, and Ackar responds by asking what the village would do when the Skrall come. Gelu then suggests adding on to the village's defenses.\n\nHours pass as the villagers add on to the defenses of the village, and eventually Kiina joins in. A few Glatorian, including Gresh, Strakk, and a few apprentices from Tesara arrive at Vulcanus. Gelu asks how Gresh got Strakk to join, and Gresh tells Gelu that he lied, and told Strakk that there was a large Exsidian payment. Gresh then explains to the other Glatorian that he met up with an Agori on the way back to Vulcanus, and the Agori told him that the Skrall informed him that the Bone Hunters would be attacking from the east, from the treacherous Iron Canyon. Raanu tells Ackar that they must build walls along the canyon rim, but Ackar refuses, and Kiina agrees, saying that they should trick the Hunters.\n\nMeanwhile, Fero and his comrades ride through the Wastelands to Vulcanus. One young Bone Hunter objects to the raid, and in response, Fero kills him. He asks if any other Bone Hunters have anything to say, and when no one answers, unwilling to be killed, the Hunters ride on. Elsewhere, in Roxtus, Tuma thinks about the past few weeks, such as an Agori betraying his kind, and supplying information to the Skrall. Stronius then comes in and asks why Tuma supplied information to Vulcanus. Tuma tells Stronius that it is a \"test\" for the Bone Hunters, and he wished to make the \"test\" harder for them.\n\nAt Vulcanus, Kiina teaches an Agori how to use a Thornax Launcher with a rock in place of the Thornax, with no success. Kiina tells the Agori to go to Gresh, who is teaching the Agori how to cut Fireroot vines for a trap. Metus, one of Gresh's Agori, tries to cut it, but gets his knife stuck in the vine. Raanu cuts the vine easily, and Metus says he would rather go to Gelu or Strakk, when he realizes Strakk is gone.\n\nLater Gelu makes a trap to be used on the Bone Hunters. When the alert is set off that the Bone Hunters have arrived, Gelu sets off the trap, killing and wounding several Bone Hunters. After losing some of his group, Fero decides to turn back and return to the desert. Upon hearing of the Bone Hunters retreat, Raanu dismisses the Glatorian, despite Kiina's warnings.\n\nKyry spots something in the desert, and upon realizing that it's Bone Hunters, attempts to warn Raanu, but is knocked unconscious. The Bone Hunters attack Vulcanus, and despite the assistance of Ackar, is badly outmatched. The other Glatorian return, this time with Tarix, Vastus, and several trainees. The Glatorian are able to defend the village from the Bone Hunters, and drive Fero, the last remaining Hunter, away.\n\nThe book begins with the Kanohi Ignika flying through space, launched from the moon Aqua Magna, containing the mind and spirit of Mata Nui, after his gigantic robot body was stolen by Teridax, right after the events of Bionicle Legends #11: The Final Battle. The former Great Spirit vows to save his people, even as the mask is caught by the nearby Bara Magna's gravity.\n\nThe Ignika lands in the desert, creating a large crater, which attracts the attention of several Scarabax Beetles, including Click. It then rises in the air and uses its power to create a body for its host, which scares most of the beetles away, except for Click. Mata Nui quickly befriends a remaining Scarabax Beetle (Click, who was not yet named), which touches the Mask of Life, and is transformed into a shield. Mata Nui immediately puts it to use defending himself, as a Vorox attacks him, which retreats after its tail breaks, from the impact of striking Mata Nui's shield very hard. The shield transforms back into a beetle, and Mata Nui picks up the tail, as a Thornatus reaches the scene, driven by Metus. The Agori agrees to take Mata Nui to Vulcanus, where he has some business. The two arrive in time to watch an Arena Match between Ackar and Strakk. The veteran overcomes the ice tribe warrior, but after surrendering Strakk attacks Ackar from behind by throwing his shield towards Ackar. Mata Nui saves the Vulcanus Glatorian, managing to defeat Strakk, when the Vorox stinger tail he carries transforms into a sword, after touching the mask.\n\nAckar takes Mata Nui to his hut. Metus arrives and offers Mata Nui the chance to become a Glatorian, but Mata Nui refuses. While he is speaking with Ackar about his mission, Kiina jumps out of hiding. After noticing Mata Nui's Scarabax and calling it Click jokingly, Mata Nui accepts the name. She, having heard him speak of his mission, offers to show Mata Nui a cavern full of ancient technology in Tajun he can use, in exchange for him taking her along on his journey.\n\nOn the next day, the three leave for Tajun on Kiina's Thornatus. While traveling through Sandray Canyon, they discuss the possibility of there being a traitor among the Agori. However, the Skopio XV-1 vehicle, piloted by Telluris (a feared and vicious Glatorian, who works with the Skrall) suddenly emerges from the ground in front of them, and Bone Hunters, sent after the group by the Agori traitor, appear behind them. At first put at a disadvantage, they manage to escape when Mata Nui creates an avalanche, which buries Telluris's Skopio XV-1 and all of the bandits, killing the pack of Bone Hunters. With Telluris knocked unconscious, they confiscate his vehicle, and imprison him. Upon reaching Tajun, the Mata Nui and Glatorian find it burning, and destroyed.\n\nInside the destroyed village, the group finds Gresh, badly wounded. They head for Kiina's cave, and while doing so, they see Tuma leading Skrall and Bone Hunters and realize they have joined forces. In Kiina's cave, they find Berix, with whom Kiina becomes annoyed for trespassing, being possessive of the cavern. Mata Nui and Ackar manage, though, to convince her to let him treat Gresh, despite her heavily negative opinion about the particular Agori. Meanwhile, Mata Nui is attracted by the inscriptions and symbols on the cavern wall, finding them familiar. Kiina negatively theorizes that it must have been built by the Great Beings, startling Mata Nui. He finds a great door marked with a familiar symbol. The Ignika opens it and inside Mata Nui finds the designs of his old robot body.\n\nIn Roxtus, Tuma gloats over his success in destroying Bara Magna's main water source, which he believes will make the other villages fight against each other for the precious substance.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Tajun, Ackar knocks out a pair of Bone Hunter guards, clearing the way for the others to come out. Seeing their weapons' sorry state, Ackar requests Mata Nui to use the Ignika's power to repair them. Mata Nui does so with Ackar's sword, granting him Fire abilities. Taking Kiina's staff next, Mata Nui states he will then resume his own quest, but is persuaded by his newfound friends to remain. He then transforms Gresh's blades next.\n\nThe group then travels to Tesara, and along the way, the Glatorian practice with their new elemental powers and Ackar starts teaching Mata Nui fighting techniques. Arriving in Tesara, they find a match between Vastus and Tarix taking place, with Metus and Raanu overseeing it. Ackar speaks to the crowd against the Glatorian system and is supported by Vastus and Tarix. The Skrall-Bone Hunter alliance and the destruction of Tajun is announced and Ackar calls for unity. Raanu states they cannot fight the Skrall, but at Ackar's request, Mata Nui demonstrates the mask's ability to transform Glatorian weapons, and made an example with Tarix's Water Blades. Raanu gets Mata Nui and the Glatorian to swear allegiance to the Agori and they all celebrate their new unity.\n\nDefenses are immediately built in Tesara. Meanwhile, Kiina corners Berix in the Hot Springs and accuses him of being the traitor, but the two are then captured by the real traitor along with some Skrall and Bone Hunters. Metus and Raanu run to the village to announce their capture and Mata Nui resolves to go rescue them, alone. Before leaving, he assists in the uniting of the two metal shelters of the village, and realizes something, though he does not share his realization with Ackar.\n\nCaged in Roxtus, Kiina and Berix are clashing over the cavern. Eventually, the two realize they were both seeking to hide from the outside world in there and agree to share the place. Meanwhile, Mata Nui reaches Roxtus, and challenges Tuma in a duel for his friends' freedom. They both battle fiercely, but Tuma gains the upperhand. Suddenly Mata Nui remembers Ackar's training and finds a wound in Tuma's back, which had been caused by a Baterra a few weeks earlier. Using it against him, he slips under the Skrall leader's guard, and strikes 3 times, which causes Tuma to faint, who was unable to bare the pain of his reopened wound.\n\nMata Nui waits for the Skrall to honor his deal with Tuma. But then Metus appears, revealing himself to be the traitor, and orders the Skrall and the Bone Hunters to kill Mata Nui. The former Great Spirit makes Click escape, but the Scarabax returns along with hundreds of its kin, which gather in a huge form resembling Malum, which temporarily scares the Skrall and Bone Hunters. Mata Nui frees Kiina and Berix, even as the Glatorian and Agori arrive to fight the Skrall and the Bone Hunters, and Click rejoins Mata Nui. Tuma, even though he is imprisoned, manages to escape into the desert, along with Telluris, who has regained possession of the ruined Skopio XV-1. As Tuma escapes, his bodyguard, Stronius temporarily takes control of the united Skrall army, in Tuma's absence.\n\nA great battle ensues, but despite the initial surprise, the enemies regroup and start defeating the Glatorian. After fighting Mata Nui briefly, Fero, the Bone Hunter leader, leaves the battle, expecting the Skrall to lose. Mata Nui manages to open a gap in their lines and spots Metus fleeing. He pursues, defeating the Agori's guards, and reaches Metus's Thornatus which is then flipped over by some Vorox. Mata Nui transforms the traitor into a snake through usage of the Ignika and returns to his friends. Meanwhile, Ackar, Gresh and Kiina, cornered by the Skrall, attempt to combine their powers but are unable to repel the assault. Mata Nui adds Life energy to their attack, increasing the intensity sufficiently to drive the Skrall, and the Bone Hunters back, leaving the Glatorian victorious, even as their enemies scattered and retreated into the wilderness.\n\nWeeks later, Mata Nui witnesses the uniting of the metallic shelters of the villages to protect the new mega-city. As the process is completed, Mata Nui's, and his friends recognize the structure's resemblance to the shape of the mechanical being (Mata Nui's original body), seen in the cavern. Berix shows Mata Nui a coin he found in the cavern, with the shape of the robot on one side, and the pattern of a Skrall shield on the other. Mata Nui resolves to discover its meaning, which is a map of the Valley of the Maze.\n\nMata Nui, accompanied by Kiina, Gresh, Ackar and Berix, serving as Chronicler, leaves on a journey north of the Black Spike Mountains, to head to the Valley of the Maze, in hopes of finding a way to regain his original body from Teridax. They will challenge many enemies, including the shapeshifting Baterra, who plagued, and nearly wiped out the Skrall. They will also have to deal with and surviving Skrall, Bone Hunters, and other threats. But, despite knowing he will soon have to fight alone, once he meets Teridax again, Mata Nui realizes his friends have taught him more than he ever learned by himself, in his long existence.\n\nAngonce stands in his chamber, reflecting lamentingly on the beauty of Spherus Magna and its past. He dwells on the Great Beings' ability to create and study, but not to lead and govern, and then the Element Lords and their failure in leading the Agori. The Great Being then walks out of his room and leaves the fortress, glancing up at the giant robot before him, the last hope for Spherus Magna. He decides to name the robot \"Mata Nui,\" which is the word for \"Great Spirit\" in the Matoran Language.\n\nWith information from the Agori Berix and Crotesius, Mata Nui has found the center of the vast Valley of the Maze, but cannot locate an entrance to the chamber within. Upon voicing his frustrations aloud, a recording asks him three questions which he realizes are a riddle. After hours of reflection, Mata Nui comes to realize that the solution to the riddle is the Three Virtues that the Great Beings had instilled in him, for they too had made the chamber. An opening is created, and Mata Nui enters down a stairway to a wide pool of lava. Immediately, he notices the Agori Tarduk suspended above the lava.\n\nAt the Mega-Village, Kiina and Ackar express worry about Mata Nui's long absence and finally agree to go search for their friend.\n\nMata Nui rescues Tarduk, but even as he does the tower begins to crumble and fall apart. Mata Nui and Tarduk flee, and once out of the building, turn to see a volcano emerging from the ground under it. Mata Nui realizes it is not a natural volcano and, by digging through the rock, finds a metal hatch and enters it, finding himself inside a mechanism created by the Great Beings. He climbs through it, eventually reaching an open space where he finds the designs of his original body, along with a screen which recounts the tale of his origin and makes him remember his original mission: to pull together the fragments of Spherus Magna. He also finds out the Great Beings had planned to build a second robot, to help him with the task, but were unable to do so. Mata Nui begins to despair, but Tarduk arrives and, learning of this, helps him realize that he can use the broken robot to achieve the same result, and the two agree to search for a second power source that the Great Beings likely built for their planned robot.\n\nNow returned to the Agori village, Mata Nui asks Raanu if he can occupy the robot, which Raanu flatly refuses. Ackar, in light of Mata Nui's role against the Skrall, persuades him to listen, and shows Raanu the real shape of the village. However, Raanu continues to refuse due to concern for the safety of the Agori, despite Mata Nui's pleas.\n\nLater, Mata Nui talks with Ackar and Gresh, explaining Makuta Teridax's ambition of conquest and power, which Mata Nui once wielded. While Ackar trusts Mata Nui completely, Gresh is shocked about Mata Nui's true nature and fears he may use the power of his old body to rule them. Mata Nui counters Gresh calmly, stating that, if Gresh does believe he is a threat, he is more than welcome to imprison him, which Gresh cannot bring himself to do.\n\nMeanwhile, Raanu reflects upon his past, the time when during the Core War he served the Great Beings and witnessed the construction of Mata Nui's original body. Finally, pondering over recent events and the decision at hand, he decides to seek out Mata Nui and discuss it with him. After the Agori leader questions Mata Nui's need, the former Great Spirit senses the Makuta's approach in order to kill him and informs Raanu of this, and that the only way he can stop him is to fight him. Faced with what Mata Nui has said, Raanu finally agrees, but warns Mata Nui against betraying them.\n\nTeridax flies through space, reflecting on the Makuta's desire for the respect of the Matoran, his struggle to take over the Matoran Universe, and his discovery of Mata Nui's survival. He accelerates toward Bara Magna, eager to eliminate Mata Nui and use Bara Magna as a base for his universal conquest.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Matoran Universe, Tahu, regarding their situation with annoyance, has just tried to ambush a group of Rahkshi with Onua, but the Rahkshi reversed their direction before the trap could be sprung. A flying member of the Order of Mata Nui arrives and announces the Rahkshi have gathered south. Tahu orders her to find as many Toa as she can to pursue the Rahkshi.\n\nMeanwhile, Nektann, on Zakaz, remembers the Skakdi history and how he allied with Teridax as they prepare to travel south.\n\nMata Nui stands in the head of the Prototype Robot with a box containing the Power Source required to energize the robot. Kiina questions him about his decision to use the robot and the impact it would have. Mata Nui reassures her and hands Click to her for safety, appreciating the friendship given to him by Kiina and the other Glatorian, to her emotional response. At his request, Kiina leaves to join the others in the desert.\n\nInside the robot, Mata Nui powers it up, fearing an explosion similar to the one that scattered it 150,000 years ago. None occurring, he removes the Ignika, allowing his body to disintegrate and beginning to focus on shifting his mind into the robot's body, successfully entering it after some struggle.\n\nIn the desert, the Glatorian and Agori witness in awe and disbelief the robot being powered up and animated as Mata Nui rises in his new body. Ackar draws his attention using his Fire powers, speaking with Mata Nui who sends them to take shelter while he begins his attempt to repair the Shattering, watching them go and requesting the Vorox, Bone Hunters and Skrall to take cover likewise, to the acquiescence of the first and suspicion of the other two. Mata Nui then releases gravitic energy aimed at Bota Magna and Aqua Magna. However, just as the beams of energy strike the targets, Teridax arrives, eclipsing the sun and striking Bara Magna, creating a gigantic crater and earthquakes.\n\nAs Kiina and Gresh look at the two robots confronting each other, Gresh suggests going out to help Mata Nui, but Kiina tells him to make a plan first.\n\nMeanwhile, Mata Nui attempts to convince Teridax not to fight, but Makuta instead tries to persuade the Great Spirit to join him. Mata Nui reveals their destiny to remake Spherus Magna, but his opponent does not accept it. He asks Mata Nui the reason for his fighting and is surprised by his new concern for the inhabitants of Bara Magna. Lifting the mountain under which the Agori and Glatorian are sheltering themselves, he threatens to drop it on them, but Mata Nui retaliates, blasting Makuta with energy.\n\nInside the robot, Tahu and Takanuva witness the quake resulting from Mata Nui's blow and Tahu melts metal falling toward them. The Rahkshi they are following are scattered too, but quickly reassemble and continue their journey south. The Toa keep pursuing them.\n\nOn Bara Magna, Mata Nui incinerates the mountain Makuta was holding, saving the Agori. He orders everyone to escape, and Ackar convinces Raanu to do so, while he and the Glatorian try to help Mata Nui. Makuta reminds Mata Nui he can make him exhaust his power to help his friends and that inside him live the Matoran, but Mata Nui resolves to keep fighting, only to discover Bara Magna's moons are drifting away from the planet and his own power supply is an hour away from depletion.\n\nIn order to assist Mata Nui, the Glatorian attack weak points of the robot under Teridax's control to distract him, while Gresh attempts to penetrate the robot, planning to then destroy everything in sight to disable the Makuta. However, the Thornax used by the Glatorian do not have any visible effect, and are apparently unnoticed by Teridax, though Gresh manages to reach a hatch at the foot of the robot.\n\nUnknown to the Glatorian, Teridax has noticed them and, having expected their resistance, carries out his prepared plan of using an assembled army of Rahkshi and Skakdi to combat them. Gresh who is at the entrance of the robot, sees it opening and hides, witnessing the arrival of the army which attacks the Glatorian. Kiina attempts to fight a Rahkshi of Heat Vision which fends off her assault and strikes her, knocking her down and robbing her of her weapon, before preparing to deal the final blow. Ackar beheads the Rahkshi and helps Kiina up, when both notice the Rahkshi's Kraata which Ackar reduces to ashes, then continuing to combat the Skakdi and Rahkshi.\n\nGresh, indecisive about whether to help his friends or invade the robot, approaches the hatch as Tahu and Takanuva exit ahead of a massive group of Toa. Believing them to be enemies, he strikes, only to be blinded by Takanuva's counterattack. The two Toa prepare to dispatch him when he realizes from their speech that they are allies and informs them of this. Tahu, conversing with Gresh, briefly explains the danger of the Rahkshi whom his friends are combating, then orders the Toa army to move out. Gresh states his plan but is dissuaded by Takanuva. The Glatorian then rushes off to fight and Takanuva begins to follow when he notices that Tahu has frozen as if in a trance, not responding to the Toa of Light.\n\nWatching the battle from atop a hill, Stronius briefly reflects over the Skrall attempt at conquest, wishing for vengeance on the Glatorian who foiled their plan (Mata Nui). He orders the few Skrall he has gathered to attack the Glatorian who have been injured.\n\nTahu stands where he perceives is Ta-Wahi, believing he is under an illusion by Teridax. The Ignika appears to him and explains that the Glatorian and Agori will not survive the battle without help. The mask then proceeds to devolve him back into a Toa Mata. As Tahu expresses his anger, the Ignika reveals the details of the Golden Armor, which can be used to help stop Teridax. It begins to create the armor for him before warning that it can only be used once, and that its use could harm him. Tahu awakens and notices the pieces of the armor appearing on the sand. He and Takanuva are able to retrieve two of the pieces, but Teridax then disperses a blast of energy, scattering the other pieces across the desert. As the Toa of Fire and Light recover, a Rahkshi snatches one of the pieces.\n\nMeanwhile, Gresh defeats several Rahkshi. Before he could go to aid Ackar, a piece of the Golden armor lands near him. He picks it up, and decides to examine it later, since a Skakdi is coming to assault him.\n\nElsewhere on the battlefield, Nektann continues in the brawl against the Glatorians, thinking to himself just how easy it was for him to defeat them. Taking notice of an embattled Rahkshi nearby, he hesitates to assist it; but he eventually decides to aid it, due to his alliance with Teridax. The warlord then pushes aside an Agori who tried to stop him, before stumbling over a piece of the golden armor. He grabs it, believing it to be something of value, as be thinks that with the battle seeming too short, he might just get some loot to make the battle worth it.\n\nMeanwhile, both Mata Nui and Teridax were fighting each other on an almost even level. Mata Nui had been able to do some more damage to Teridax, but Teridax has more energy reserves, and greater strength. Teridax currently has the advantage over Mata Nui, who barely manages to hold his own. Mata Nui fires an energy blast at Teridax in retaliation to one of Teridax's comments, fusing some circuits together again within him, and causing some minor damage. In response, Teridax angrily prepares to crush the planet with gravitational power, which would cause the world to fold upon itself, and would result in the death of everybody on the planet, except for Teridax, and Mata Nui.\n\nDuring the minutes before Teridax's blast, Gresh spots Skrall warriors joining the fight and turns to attack them. Spotting a piece of Golden Armor in one's hand and believing it to be a weapon, he attacks the Skrall with his air power, and manages to get the piece to fly to him, even as three Skrall successfully battle their way through the windstorm, to attack him.\n\nMeanwhile, Takanuva is fighting 2 Rahkshi of Heat Vision, who are now more resistant to his light powers. He gains the upper hand over one, only to be hit by another one's beams. To save himself, he creates a hologram of himself, tricking the Rahkshi into hitting each other before finishing them. As he collects a piece of Golden Armor from one, he vows that it was time to crush Teridax's evil once and for all.\n\nAt the same time, Tahu is fighting Nektann. The Skakdi tries to bait him into fighting without using his power, but Tahu doesn't fall for it. Instead, he uses his power to make his sword hot enough to melt through Nektann's Crescent Scythe, which cuts it in half. Tahu states pride does not count, only winning does. Nektann counters saying that maybe some of the Skakdi (in this case, the Piraka, who had beaten the Toa Nuva bad in Bionicle Legends #1 island of Doom) have beaten them, and then have made the Toa just like them. To this, Tahu says that he fights to save lives, unlike the Skakdi, who fight to take them. Challenging this, Nektann carries Tahu into the midst of the battle, so that he can't use his powers without killing his allies, but Tahu flips the Skakdi over, which negates Nektann's efforts. When Tahu states he's ready to do anything to win, the Skakdi rises up faster than he could have imagined, and chokes him, only to have his armor melted. Tahu then collects the Golden Armor piece, but leaves the Skakdi alive, after knocking him out.\n\nJust as Teridax releases the gravitational blast, Mata Nui grabs Teridax's arm and jerks it into the air, causing the gravity blast to strike Aqua and Bota Magna instead, drawing them back towards Bara Magna. Teridax pushes Mata Nui away, but he responds with a relentless attack on Teridax, striking too quickly for Teridax to respond, driving him to the northernmost reaches of Bara Magna. Just before he could finish him off at his destination, however, the power of Mata Nui's robot body runs down. In response, Teridax punches Mata Nui, sending him crashing to the ground, and then gloats that he has won.\n\nMeanwhile, Tahu and Takanuva have gathered four pieces of the golden armor. As they wonder where the other two are, they notice Gresh in a fight with a Skakdi, who had defeated the 3 Skrall warriors earlier. Felling the Skakdi with heat and light, they take the two pieces in Gresh's satchel. Quickly, Tahu places them on, and wills the armor's power to activate. Immediately, power surges through him, locking his muscles with electricity, and causing his body to emit a blinding light. As he screams in pain, tendrils of energy launch out from him, coiling around every Rahkshi on the battlefield. The Rahkshi fall to the ground, seized by spasms as their power is pulled through the tendrils and into Tahu. Then, the Rahkshi armor disintegrate, and the Kraata inside explode into shards of shadow. With the Rahkshi dead, the Skakdi and Skrall quickly surrender or run away into the desert, as they are now greatly outnumbered.\n\nUp above, Teridax feels the deaths of his thousands of Rahkshi, causing him to hesitate for a moment. Taking advantage of this, Mata Nui shoves Teridax's body into the path of the jungle moon of Bota Magna, which smashes into his head and destroys his core processor, killing Teridax. But without Teridax controlling the robot body, its massive weight causes it to fall towards the desert of Bara Magna, which threatens to kill all of Mata Nui's friends. Using every bit of strength his robot body possessed, Mata Nui quickly pushes Teridax away onto the Black Spike Mountains, which crushes the mountain range to powder. At the same time, Bota Magna and Aqua Magna collide with Bara Magna, merging back into Spherus Magna.\n\nTahu and Takanuva are looking at the fallen robot that houses the Matoran Universe as beings begin streaming out. Takanuva wonders if Makuta's really gone and if the Matoran can survive on Bara Magna, but Tahu is confident they can.\n\nFrom above, Mata Nui watches the inhabitants of the Matoran Universe meet with the Bara Magna's inhabitants and decides to give them a new place to live in. To do that, he combines his last energies with the Kanohi Ignika's and bathes Spherus Magna with life energy, making plants grow everywhere and rivers appear, healing all of the damage done to the planet, and making it even better than it had ever been. The energy also heals those in The Pit who have been mutated, which reverses the mutation done to them, while still allowing them to breathe water, and also removes the mutagen in the water, so that no one can be mutated again. But the effort is overwhelming, and because of the strain, and the depletion of energy, the robot falls apart. Kiina and Ackar, along with the other combatants (Toa, Matoran, Glatorian, Agori, others (etc.)) race to the site, only to see that nothing is left intact. However, they find the Mask of Life still intact, which suddenly begins hovering in the air.\n\nFrom the mask, Mata Nui, whose spirit was called back to it, in virtue of having inhabited it for so long, speaks to the assembled crowd, and refuses Tahu's request to remain to guide them. He only asks them to search for the Great Beings, to make them understand what he, too, has learned during his time on Bara Magna, so that he will be able to look forward to returning, on the day that the Great Beings return.\n\nMata Nui then stops speaking, as he has gone dormant, and the mask falls into Kiina's hands. Tahu gently takes it from her, and declares that it was time to move on.\n\nSee List of Bionicle media for \"Bionicle Legends\" publishing information.\n"}
{"id": "1832038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832038", "title": "Phi features", "text": "Phi features\n\nIn linguistics, especially within generative grammar, phi features (denoted with the Greek letter φ 'phi') are the semantic features of person, number, gender, and case, as encoded in pronominal agreement with nouns and pronouns (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe lexical categories and case features.\n\nPhi-features are often thought of as the \"silent\" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a pro-drop phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.\n\nChomsky first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In English, we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but some other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly verbs and adjectives are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, however, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person.\n\nIn English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table: \n\nIn a null-subject language such as Italian, however, pronominal subjects are not required (in fact, in many null-subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). These type of \"unstressed\" pronouns are called clitic pronouns. Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology on verbs that is based on the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:- Camminare (\"to walk\"):cammino (\"I walk)\", camminiamo (\"we walk\")cammini (\"you walk\"), camminate (\"you all walk\")cammina (\"he/she walks\"), camminano (\"they walk\")\n\nThe grammatical term number is the name of the system contrasting singular and plural. In English, number agreement is not expressed through agreement of verbal elements like they are in other languages (though present tense verbs do agree in number with third person subjects). This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. Instead, English number is a phi-feature that is inflected on nouns when the nominal phrase is plural. The most common in English is \"-s\" inflected on nouns that are plural:- Ducks, fridges, baseballs, cups, books, mirrors, cars, buildings, clowns, bridges, creams...Some cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:- Men, women, mice, teeth...Neither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the number feature of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.\n\nSome languages, however, like Salish Halkomelem, differ from English in their syntactic categorization of plural marking. Halkomelem allows for both marked and unmarked plural forms of its nouns. It also allows for the determiners to be marked or unmarked in their plurality. Plural nouns and determiners in Halkomelem can be freely combined as well, but it appears that if a determiner is plural in a phrase it is sufficient to pluralize the noun that it modifies:\nEnglish is a language that does not have nominal phrases that belong to a gender class where agreement of other elements in the phrase is required. Dutch is another language that only differentiates between neuter and the common gender. Many other languages of the world do have gender classes. German, for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. For a Romance language like Italian, there are feminine and masculine genders. Inflections on the adjectives and determiners are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.\n\nEnglish only expresses gender when the pronoun addresses a specific person who semantically belongs to a certain gender. See the table below for Pronominal Case Forms in English under 3 sg. fem/masc.\n\nThe phi-feature of case is explicit in English only for pronominal forms (see the picture of the table for Pronominal Case Forms in English). English is not a language that has inflectional case forms for proper nouns. \n\nGerman is language that exhibits some inflectional case forms on nouns. It also obligatorily displays case forms on its determiners: \n\nCase in terms of reflexivity is overt in English for every person (see the table for Pronominal Case Forms in English):myself\", yourself\", himself, herself,yourselves, ourselves, themselvesThe pattern for the reflexive form of the third person masculine pronoun does not follow the same pattern of reflexivity as the other pronouns in terms of case form marking for pronominal English.\n\nIn many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in French \"se\". French \"se\" is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person, regardless of gender or person. It also functions as a middle, an inchoative, an applicative and an impersonal. For this reason, some theories suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun. This creates a new \"silent\" projection to a node specifically for φ-reflexives in French structure.\n\nPhi-features can also be considered the silent features that determine whether a root word is a noun or a verb. This is called the noun-verb distinction of Distributed Morphology. The table below describes how category classes are organized by their Nominal or Verbal characteristics. Definitions for these four categories of predicates have been described as follows: A verbal predicate has a predicative use only; a nominal predicate can be used as the head of a term; an adjectival predicate can be used as a modifier of a nominal head; a preposition acts as a term-predicate for which the noun is still the head; an adverbial (not shown below) predicate can be used as a modifier of a non-nominal head.\n\nX-bar theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its categorical features, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features. It has also been argued that adpositions (cover term for prepositions and postpositions) are not part of the [+/-N] [+/-V] system as shown above. This is because they resist being part of a single class category, like nouns, verbs and adjectives do. This argument also posits that some appositions may behave as part of this type of categorization, but not all of them do.\n\nThere are three main hypotheses regarding the syntactic categories of words. The first one is the \"Strong Lexical\" hypothesis, which states that verbs and nouns are inherent in nature, and when a word such as \"walk\" in English can surface as either a noun or a verb, depending on the speaker's intuitions of what the meaning of the verb is. This means that the root \"walk\" in English has two separate lexical entries:walk N <[AP]>\n\n\"an act or instance of going on foot especially for exercise or pleasure\"walk V <[DPtheme]>\n\n\"to move along on foot : advance by steps\"\n\nThis analysis states that the category is determined by syntax or context. A root word is inserted into the syntax as bare and the surrounding syntax determines if it will behave as a verb or a noun. Once the environment has determined its category, morphological inflections also surface on the root according to the determined category. Typically, if the element before it is a determiner, the word will surface as a noun, and if the element before it is a tense element, the root word will surface as a verb. The example in the photo shows an example from Italian. The root of the word is \"cammin-\" (\"walk\"). This word could surface as either a noun or verb. The first tree shows that when the element before is a D \"\"una\"\", the root will be an N and the following morphology will inflect \"-ata\" which is the correct full orthography for the noun \"walk\" in Italian. The tree on the right shows a similar process but in the environment where the root follows a tense element, and the morphology inflects \"-o\" as a suffix, which makes the verb surface not only as a verb, but as discussed before in person agreement, also shows that this is the first person present form of the verb (\"I walk\").\n\nSyntactic decomposition for categorization of parts of speech includes an explanation for why some verbs and nouns have a predictable relationship to their nominal counterparts and why some don't. It says that the predictable forms are denominal and that the unpredictable forms are strictly root-derived. The examples provided are of the English verbs \"hammer\" and \"tape\". A verb such as hammer is a root-derived form, meaning that it can appear within an NP or within a VP. A denominalized verb, such as tape must first be converted from an NP because its meaning relies on the semantics of the noun.\n\nThe discussion of how categorical features are determined is still up for debate and there have been numerous other theories trying to explain how words get their meanings and surface in a category. This is an issue within categorical distinction theories that has not yet come to a conclusion which is agreed upon in the linguistic community. This is interesting because phi-features in terms of person, number and gender are concrete features that have been observed numerous times in natural languages, and are consistent patterns that are rooted in rule-based grammar.\n"}
{"id": "1832043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832043", "title": "Apocryphon of James", "text": "Apocryphon of James\n\nThe Apocryphon of James, also known by the translation of its title – the Secret Book of James, is a pseudonymous text amongst the New Testament apocrypha. It describes the secret teachings of Jesus to Peter and James, given after the Resurrection but before the Ascension.\n\nA major theme is that one must accept suffering as inevitable. The prominence of James and Peter suggest that the work originated in the Jewish Christian community. It shows no dependence on canonical texts, and was probably written in the first half of the 2nd century. It has Gnostic affinities but cannot be attributed to any Gnostic sect, and some scholars rule that it is not Gnostic at all.\n\nThe text survives in a single, damaged manuscript as the second section of the Jung Codex, first of the thirteen codices in the Nag Hammadi library. Although the text appears to be a Coptic translation from Greek, the author claims to have written in Hebrew. Because of references to persecution and martyrdom, it is unlikely that the text was written after 313, when Constantine I ended Christian persecution. Other clues in the text point to a composition in the 2nd century, and perhaps in the first half.\n\nThe text is framed as an epistle (i.e. a letter) from James to someone else whose name is obscured by the damage to the text. The author describes Jesus expanding on various sayings and answering questions 550 days after the Resurrection, but before the Ascension. Both James and Peter are given secret instruction, but at the end only James appears to understand what has happened. (As with the Gospel of John 1–20 and the Gospel of Mary, in this book Peter has implicitly failed the Christian movement).\n\nJesus gives teachings in unusual and seemingly contradictory phrases, and also offers brief parables. He invites Peter and James into the Kingdom of Heaven with him, but they are distracted by the other apostles' questions and miss their chance. Afterwards, James is described as sending out the 12 apostles, indicating (as in other apocryphal documents) that James initially succeeded Jesus as the leader of the movement.\n\nThe brief framing letter appears independent of the remainder of the text, suggesting to some that the Apocryphon may have originated as multiple separate texts redacted together. This framing letter references a previous \"secret gospel\", which has apparently been lost. Within the Apocryphon, the discussions of martyrdom and prophecy also appear to be somewhat separate, indicating an original text, for the main body of the document, which was composed of brief sayings. It is still debated whether the closest parallels to the New Testament canon are part of the Apocryphon's last redactional hand or else part of its sources.\n\nTo many scholars, the flavor of the sayings appears somewhat gnostic in tone, primarily because its doctrines do not accord with orthodox interpretation of canonical scripture. The manuscript was also found among explicit gnostic teachings in the Nag Hammadi Library. The text also uses gnostic terms, such as referring to \"fullness\" as a means to salvation, but the doctrines in the Apocryphon of James certainly do not accord with the Valentinian or other developed gnostic cosmologies, so it is not usually counted as a truly gnostic text.\n\nMany of the sayings appear to be shared with the canonical Gospels, and the text includes this reference to other sayings: \"It sufficed for some persons to pay attention to the teaching and understand 'The Shepherds' and 'The Seed' and 'The Building' and 'The Lamps of the Virgins' and 'The Wage of the Workers' and 'The Double Drachma' and 'The Woman'.\" The references to salvation through \"the cross\" seem to imply familiarity with Paul's letters, or at least his teachings. But its introduction says, \"And five hundred and fifty days after he arose from the dead, we said to him: ...\", which is considerably longer than the forty days which Luke's Acts of the Apostles gives for the Ascension. Some have felt that this implies that the relationship of the Apocryphon of James with the canon is through oral tradition, and that the community which wrote it rejected or else did not know Luke-Acts. (On the other hand, Irenaeus in \"Against Heresies\" gave a time span of eighteen months, and Irenaeus was certainly familiar with the work.) Some scholars posit that the earliest version of the Apocryphon was independent of the canonical gospels, but that an unknown redactor knew of and referenced canonical works in the known edition.\n\n"}

{"id": "1832050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832050", "title": "Roman funerary practices", "text": "Roman funerary practices\n\nRoman funerary practices include the Ancient Romans' religious rituals concerning funerals, cremations, and burials. They were part of the Tradition (), the unwritten code from which Romans derived their social norms.\n\nRoman cemeteries were located outside the sacred boundary of its cities (\"\"). They were visited regularly with offerings of food and wine, and special observances during Roman festivals in honor of the dead. Funeral monuments appear throughout the Roman Empire, and their inscriptions are an important source of information for otherwise unknown individuals and history. A Roman sarcophagus could be an elaborately crafted art work, decorated with relief sculpture depicting a scene that was allegorical, mythological, or historical, or a scene from everyday life.\n\nAlthough funerals were primarily a concern of the family, which was of paramount importance in Roman society, those who lacked the support of an extended family usually belonged to guilds or \"collegia\" which provided funeral services for members.\n\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity, the bodies of the dead were regarded as polluting. At the same time, loving duty toward one's ancestors (\"\") was a fundamental part of ancient Roman culture. The care of the dead negotiated these two emotionally opposed attitudes.\n\nWhen a person died at home, family members and intimate friends gathered around the death bed. In accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, the closest relative gave the last goodbye to the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, and closed the eyes. The relatives began lamentations, calling on the deceased by name. The body was then placed on the ground, washed, and anointed. This practice mirrored the placement of new-born infants on the bare earth. Mourners were expected to dress in a manner appropriate to the occasion and to their station (for example, an upper class citizen would wear a dark-colored toga (\"toga pulla\"), reserved for funerals). If the deceased was a male citizen, he was dressed in his toga; if he had earned a wreath in life, he wore one in death. Wreaths also are found in burials of initiates into mystery religions. After the body was prepared, it lay in state in the atrium of the family home ('), with the feet pointed toward the door. Other circumstances pertained to those who lived, as most Romans did, in apartment buildings ('), but elite practices are better documented.\n\nAlthough embalming was unusual and regarded as mainly an Egyptian practice, it is mentioned in Latin literature, with a few instances documented by archaeology in Rome and throughout the Empire where no Egyptian influence can be assumed. Since elite funerals required complex arrangements, the body had to be preserved in the meantime.\n\n\"Charon's obol\" was a coin placed in or on the mouth of the deceased. The custom is recorded in literary sources and attested by archaeology, and sometimes occurs in contexts that suggest it may have been imported to Rome as were the mystery religions that promised initiates salvation or special passage in the afterlife. The custom was explained by the myth of Charon, the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the newly dead across the water — a lake, river, or swamp — that separated the world of the living from the underworld. The coin was rationalized as his payment; the satirist Lucian remarks that in order to avoid death, one should simply not pay the fee. In Apuleius's tale of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in his \"Metamorphoses\", framed by Lucius's quest for salvation ending with initiation into the mysteries of Isis, Psyche (\"Soul\") carries two coins in her journey to the underworld, the second to enable her return or symbolic rebirth. Evidence of \"Charon's obol\" appears throughout the Western Roman Empire well into the Christian era, but at no time and place was it practiced consistently and by all.\n\nAlthough inhumation was practiced regularly in archaic Rome, cremation was the most common burial practice in the Mid- to Late Republic and the Empire into the 1st and 2nd centuries. Crematory images appear in Latin poetry on the theme of the dead and mourning. In one of the best-known classical Latin poems of mourning, Catullus writes of his long journey to attend to the funeral rites of his brother, who died abroad, and expresses his grief at addressing only silent ash. When Propertius describes his dead lover Cynthia visiting him in a dream, the revenant's dress is scorched down the side and the fire of the pyre has corroded the familiar ring she wears.\n\nUltimately, inhumation would replace cremation; a variety of factors, including decreasing levels of urbanization and changes in attitudes to the afterlife, would contribute to this marked shift in popular burial practices.\n\nThe care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation. Libations were brought to the grave, and some tombs were even equipped with \"feeding tubes\" to facilitate delivery .\n\nThe Romans referred to infants who died in the cradle as \"arpagi\" (singular \"arpagus\"). The Romans did not hold funerals for \"arpagi.\" Their bodies were not cremated, or interred, and no monuments or epitaphs were made for them. Eventually, infants who had lived 40 or more days and had cut teeth before their deaths were distinguished from the \"arpagi\"; they were referred to as \"rapti,\" and they were cremated.\n\nFuneral rites took place at home and at the place of burial, which was located outside the city to avoid the pollution of the living. The funeral procession \"(pompa funebris)\" transited the distance between the two.\n\nA professional guild (\"\") of musicians specialized in funeral music. Horace mentions the \"tuba\" and the \"cornu\", two bronze trumpet-like instruments, at funerals.\n\nThe eulogy (') was a formal oration or panegyric in praise of the dead. It was one of two forms of discourse at a Roman funeral, the other being the chant ('). The practice is associated with noble families, and the conventions for words spoken at an ordinary person's funeral go unrecorded. While oratory was practiced in Rome only by men, an elite woman might also be honored with a eulogy.\n\nFor socially prominent individuals, the funeral procession stopped at the forum for the public delivery of the eulogy from the Rostra. Thus a well-delivered funeral oration could be a way for a young politician to publicize himself. Aunt Julia's Eulogy (\"\"), a speech made by the young Julius Caesar in honor of his aunt, the widow of Gaius Marius, helped launch his political career as a populist.\n\nThe epitaph of the deceased in effect was a digest of the eulogy made visible and permanent, and might include the career (\"cursus honorum\") of a man who had held public offices. In commemorating past deeds, the eulogy was a precursor to Roman historiography.\n\nAfter the body was carried to the cemetery, a sacrifice was performed in the presence of the corpse. Until the time of Cicero, it was customary to offer a sow to Ceres, a sow also being a characteristic offering to chthonic deities. The sacrificial victim was then allotted for consumption among the participants. The portion for the deceased was put on a spit and cremated with the body. Ceres' portion was burned on an altar. The family ate the portion that was due the living. A family of lesser means offered a libation of wine, incense, produce or grain; the allocation of these offerings is not recorded. After this apportioning, the deceased had transitioned and could no longer share in the meals of the living and the domestic gods; they now partook of what was appropriate for the spirits of the dead, the Manes.\n\nOn the ninth day after the person died, the funeral feast and rites called the \"novendialis\" or \"novemdialis\" were held. A libation to the Manes was poured onto the grave. This concluded the period of full mourning. Mourning dress was put aside, and a feast was given.\n\nIn February, the last month of the original Roman calendar when March 1 was New Year's Day, the dead were honored at a nine-day festival called the Parentalia, followed by the Feralia on February 21, when the potentially malign spirits of the dead were propitiated. During the Parentalia, families gathered at cemeteries to offer meals to the ancestors, and then shared wine and cakes among themselves (compare veneration of the dead in other cultures). Tombs for wealthy, prominent families were constructed as \"houses\", with a decorated room for these banqueting festivities.\n\nEpitaphs are one of the major classes of inscriptions. An epitaph usually noted the person's day of birth and lifespan. Information varies, but collectively they offer information on family relationships, political offices, and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise.\n\nPhilosophical beliefs may also be in evidence. The epitaphs of Epicureans often expressed some form of the sentiment \"non fui, fui, non sum, non desidero\", \"I did not exist, I have existed, I do not exist, I feel no desire,\" or \"non fui, non sum, non curo\", \"I did not exist, I do not exist, I'm not concerned about it.\"\n\nNoble Roman families often displayed a series of \"images\" ( ',  ') in the atrium of their family home. There is some uncertainty about whether these \"images\" were funeral masks, busts, or both together. The \"images\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (') summarizing the individual's offices held (') and accomplishments (\"\"), a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks. In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well.\n\nFuneral masks were most likely made of wax and possibly molded as death masks directly from the deceased. They were worn in the funeral procession either by actors who were professional mourners, or by appropriate members of the family. Practice may have varied by period or by family, since sources give no consistent account.\n\nThe display of ancestral images in aristocratic houses of the Republic and the public funerals are described by Pliny, Natural History 35, 4-11.\n\nSince references to \"images\" often fail to distinguish between commemorative portrait busts, extant examples of which are abundant, or funeral masks made of more perishable materials, none can be identified with certainty as having survived. The veristic tradition of funerary likenesses, however, contributed to the development of realistic Roman portraiture. In Roman Egypt, the Fayum mummy portraits reflect traditions of Egyptian and Roman funerary portraiture and the techniques of Hellenistic painting.\n\nThe funerary urns in which the ashes of the cremated were placed were gradually overtaken in popularity by the sarcophagus as inhumation became more common. Particularly in the 2nd–4th centuries, these were often decorated with reliefs that became an important vehicle for Late Roman sculpture. The scenes depicted were drawn from mythology, religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, allegories, history, or scenes of hunting or feasting. Many sarcophagi depict Nereids, fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the Isles of the Blessed across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell. The sarcophagus of a child may show tender representations of family life, Cupids, or children playing.\nSome sarcophagi may have been ordered during the person's life and custom-made to express their beliefs or aesthetics. Most were mass-produced, and if they contained a portrait of the deceased, as many did, with the face of the figure left unfinished until purchase. The carved sarcophagus survived the transition to Christianity, and became the first common location for Christian sculpture, in works like the mid 4th-century Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus.\n\nAncient Rome has become an excavation site known for its rather extravagant cemeteries. All in all, the commoners and wealthy families of Rome were buried in the same cemeteries; the wealthy, however, had more elaborate tombs. The tombs of the wealthy were typically cut out of bedrock and rectangular in shape. These rectangular tombs resembled the Ancient Roman's house structure, having doors, and many different chambers. Of these chambers, one of them was used to hold the dead's memorial ceremony. During this ceremony, the family of the deceased would get together and have dinner. Other chambers were used to house anything thought necessary for the person laid to rest – including portraits of the deceased and any paraphernalia needed for the memorial ceremony that had yet to come.\n\nWealthy and prominent families had large, sometimes enormous, mausoleums. The Castel Sant'Angelo by the Vatican, originally the mausoleum of Hadrian, is the best preserved, as it was converted to a fortress. The Tomb of the Scipios was the family tomb of the Scipios, located in an aristocratic cemetery, and in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD. A grand mausoleum might include bedrooms and kitchens for family visits which would include feasts. For the wealthy middle class, smaller mausolea lined the roads from cities, many of which still remain in the Tombs of Via Latina, along the Appian Way, and elsewhere. The Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker is a famous and originally very ostentatious tomb in a prime spot just outside the Porta Maggiore, erected for a rich freedman baker around 50–20 BC.\n\nThe tombs at Petra, in the far east of the Empire are cut into cliffs, some with elaborate facades in the \"baroque\" style of the Imperial period. The less wealthy made do with smaller tombs, often featuring relief busts over a lengthy inscription. Cheaper still were the Catacombs of Rome, famously used by Christians, but also by all religions, with some specialization, such as special Jewish sections. These were large systems of narrow tunnels in the soft rock below Rome, where niches were sold to the families of the deceased in a very profitable, if rather smelly, trade. Decoration included paintings, many of which have survived. The exterior of the tomb resembled that of a garden. Beautiful flowers and plants decked the outside of the tombs and made them more flattering to the eye. This was probably where the tradition of bringing flowers to a loved one's grave site began. Other items were also added to the outside of the wealthy's tombs to make it more decorative. The burial chamber of the deceased was above ground and stocked with relics that were important to the deceased Roman. Lack of relics found in excavated tombs was most probably due to grave robbing.\n\nIn the Christian period, it became desirable to be buried near the grave of a famous martyr, and large funeral halls were opened over such graves, which were often in a catacomb underneath. These contained rows of tombs, but also space for meals for the family, now probably to be seen as agape feasts. Many of the large Roman churches began as funeral halls, which were originally private enterprises; the family of Constantine owned the one over the grave of Saint Agnes of Rome, whose ruins are next to Santa Costanza, originally a Constantinian family mausoleum forming an apse to the hall.\n\n\"The cult of the dead,\" it has been noted, \"was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise.\" The Roman value of \"pietas\" encompassed the desire of soldiers to honor their fallen comrades, though the conditions of war might interfere with the timely performance of traditional rites. Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial. Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site. When the Roman army under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus suffered their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, they remained uncommemorated until Germanicus and his troops located the battlefield a few years later and made a funeral mound for their remains.\n\nIn the permanent garrisons of the Empire, a portion of each soldier's pay was set aside and pooled for funeral expenses, including the ritual meal, the burial, and commemoration. Soldiers who died of illness or an accident during the normal routines of life would have been given the same rites as in civilian life. The first burial clubs for soldiers were formed under Augustus; burial societies had existed for civilians long before. Veterans might pay into a fund upon leaving the service, insuring a decent burial by membership in an association for that purpose.\n\nTombstones and monuments throughout the Empire document military personnel and units stationed at particular camps \"(castra)\". If the body could not be recovered, the death could be commemorated with a cenotaph. Epitaphs on Roman military tombstones usually give the soldier's name, his birthplace, rank and unit, age and years of service, and sometimes other information such as the names of his heirs. Some more elaborate monuments depict the deceased, either in his parade regalia or in civilian dress to emphasize his citizenship. Cavalrymen are often shown riding over the body of a downtrodden foe, an image interpreted as a symbolic victory over death. Military funeral monuments from Roman Africa take progressively more substantial forms: steles in the 1st century, altars in the 2nd, and cupulas (mounds) in the 3rd. Tombs were often grouped in military cemeteries along the roads that led out of the camp. A centurion might be well-off enough to have a mausoleum built.\n\nIf a commander was killed in action, the men rode or marched around his pyre, or in some circumstances a cenotaph.\n\nStandard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus. It is unclear how ancient such beliefs were, as they seem influenced by Greek mythology and mystery cults.\n\nThe mysteries continued under Rome and seem to have promised immortality only for the initiated. Known forms of esoteric religion combined Roman, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern mythology and astrology, describing the progress of its initiates through the regions of the moon, sun, and stars. The uninitiated or virtueless were then left behind, the underworld becoming solely a place of torment. Common depictions of the afterlife of the bless include rest, a celestial banquet, and the vision of God (\"\" or Jupiter).\n\nThe mainstream of Roman philosophy, such as the Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. \"It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who are with us, yet not grieving for those departing.\" To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a \"jar\" or \"crystal cup\" which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since \"you love a mortal, something not your own. It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool.\"\n\nThere was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, that there are people who believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1832058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832058", "title": "Stay Puft Marshmallow Man", "text": "Stay Puft Marshmallow Man\n\nThe Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is a fictional character from the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise, which sometimes appears as a giant, lumbering paranormal monster. It first appears in the \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) film as a picture logo on a prop package of marshmallows in Dana Barrett's apartment, on a graffiti advertisement on the building next to the Ghostbusters' HQ, and then in the climax of the film as the physical manifestation of the Sumerian deity Gozer. Subsequently, it has been incorporated into many other Ghostbusters media, including the animated series \"The Real Ghostbusters\", comic books, a stage show, and video games.\n\nIn the \"Ghostbusters\" universe, it is the mascot of the fictional Stay Puft Marshmallow Corporation, much like Michelin's Bibendum (also known as the \"Michelin Man\") and the Pillsbury Doughboy (both of which it resembles). Within that universe, it is also the subject of a \"Marshmallow Man\" cartoon series.\n\nStay Puft is a large white humanoid figure made of conjoined marshmallows. He wears a white sailor cap with a red ribbon attached on top, and a blue hatband. Around his neck is a backwards blue traditional sailor's collar and a red neckerchief.\n\nAfter images of him are seen on a billboard and a bag of the marshmallows earlier in the film, he is then seen in the climax of \"Ghostbusters\" as one of two physical bodies of Gozer, a god who is defeated when Stay Puft is destroyed. Stay Puft's exact to-scale height in the movie is 112.5 feet (34.3 m) tall, while his height in the novelization of the movie is given at 100 feet (30.5 m).\n\nHe is then recreated and subsequently captured a number of different times by the Ghostbusters. Although mean and destructive at first, he later befriends Slimer and the Ghostbusters in the animated series \"The Real Ghostbusters\", and helps them out with various problems.\n\nDan Aykroyd conceived of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man for his initial script for \"Ghostbusters\" the movie. He created the character to show that \"it seems harmless and puffy and cute—but given the right circumstances, everything can be turned black and become evil\". Stay Puft was only one of many large-scale monsters in this early draft of the script, but after Aykroyd worked with co-writer Harold Ramis and director Ivan Reitman, the team scaled back the intended sequence until only Stay Puft remained out of the original large-scale monsters.\n\nThe likeness of Stay Puft was inspired by Peter O'Boyle, a security guard at Columbia Pictures whom Reitman met while filming his previous movie, \"\" (1983). According to Sam Delaney of \"The Guardian\", \"Stay Puft's familiar mascot combined elements of real-life brand ambassadors the Pillsbury Doughboy and Bibendum (a.k.a. the Michelin Tire Man).\"\n\nStay Puft is seen only briefly in the movie. He is \"conjured up\" as a new form for the Sumerian god Gozer, who previously arrives atop an apartment building at 55 Central Park West in New York City in the form of an androgynous woman with metallic skin and eyes. After a quick battle with the Ghostbusters she vanishes, and then as a disembodied voice Gozer tells the Ghostbusters that the next thing they think of will be the form it will assume to destroy their world. Ray Stantz (Aykroyd) instead makes the decision to think of this marshmallow mascot when the Ghostbusters are given a choice as to which physical form Gozer will conquer the world in.\n\nAs he explains, \"It just popped in there\", and that he \"tried to think of the most harmless thing\", describing Mr. Stay Puft as \"something that could never possibly destroy us\". Moments later, a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is seen walking towards the apartment building. The Ghostbusters shoot at Stay Puft with their proton packs, setting him on fire, but do not succeed in stopping his advance. They then get the idea of shooting at the portal through which the god emerged, by crossing the streams of all four of their packs. The plan triggers an explosion that destroys the gate and Stay Puft, reducing the latter into molten marshmallow cream that rains down onto the roof of the skyscraper and bystanders on the street below.\n\nThe character as seen in the movie was created by Linda Frobos by using miniatures and optical compositing with Billy Bryan himself in a latex suit. The suit was made of two layers, an outer flammable layer and inner fire-proof layer. Some of the finished movie's most noticeable errors appear in the Stay Puft scenes: he is seen with and without his bow tie, while in other scenes the optical rendering was so poor that he passes through a church rather than crushing it. Also, the blue portion of his sailor suit is worn backwards.\n\n\n\nFollowing the original film, the television series \"The Real Ghostbusters\" brought Stay Puft back; in fact Joe Medjuck, the executive producer of the show, states that Stay Puft was in the first script they received from Dan Aykroyd on the series. In the episode titled, \"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream\", a spectral Sandman creates versions of anything which a person is dreaming of – in this way a new version of Stay Puft is created – however, whatever is created disappears when the person awakens. In the episode \"Dedcon 1\", Stay Puft appears as a guest of honor at a ghost convention. After another episode, \"Cry Uncle\", he is accidentally freed from the Ghostbusters' containment system and later recaptured. He reappears in episode 65, \"The Revenge of Murray the Mantis\", where he is \"released\" from the Ghostbusters' containment unit to help defeat a giant mantis too powerful for the Ghostbusters to fight on their own. Stay Puft is controlled with the help of Slimer (a green blob-like creature). After defeating the Mantis, Stay Puft floats behind the Ghostbusters in a parade. He later helps them again in the episode \"Sticky Business\" number 85, when the president of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Company asks the Ghostbusters if he can use their large Stay Puft in a television commercial. Once again Slimer goes into the containment unit to bring Stay Puft out. An episode explains that Egon took a sample of the marshmallow ectoplasm and positively charged it, thus creating a friendly version of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that would assist the Ghostbusters when needed. When questioned by a policeman in the series about the abrupt personality change, Peter replied that Stay Puft was \"all better now\". The character was voiced by John Stocker, and later by Frank Welker in this series.\n\nSet two years after the events in the film \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989), the Atari game \"\" (2009) brings back the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man to ravage Times Square while searching for Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn. Stay-Puft has the ability to spawn tiny marshmallow monsters which do his bidding. Peter, Ray, and a new rookie escort Dr. Selwyn to the roof of a tall building. In pursuit, Stay Puft climbs the side of the building while Egon at street level preparing a large trap. The rookie burns Stay Puft's face with \"Boson Darts\" from an upgraded proton pack, causing Stay Puft to fall to street level, where he exploded upon impact, scattering his marshmallow body all over Times Square and his hat, which hangs from one of the neighboring buildings. Towards the game's climax, the characters realize that Gozer assumed the form of Stay Puft again because he can only have one destructor form for each dimension he enters; he was locked into the form of the Marshmallow Man when summoned back to the Earthly plane. This causes Ray to admit he had not selected such a bad destructor after all. In the realistic version, the player can listen to one of the in-game answering machine messages from an upset member of the fictional company that owns the Stay Puft Marshmallow brand (voiced by Chuck Huber), who is unhappy with the recent Gozer/Stay Puft attack believing it was a publicity stunt by the Ghostbusters. A Stay Puft Figurine appears as one of the collectible paranormal objects found in the game; it is found in the kitchen area of the Sedgewick Hotel and, after being collected, will appear in the Ghostbuster Firehouse's bunkhouse.\n\nAlong with the original 1986 Kenner line of Ghostbusters toys, Stay Puft has been included in:\n\n"}

Auel published in April 2002. It is the sequel to \"The Plains of Passage\" – published 12 years earlier – and fifth in the Earth's Children series. It describes the return of Jondalar to his homeland along with Ayla.\n\nCentral to this book is the tension created by Ayla's healing art, her pregnancy, and the acceptance of her by Jondalar's people, the Zelandonii. Ayla was raised by Clan Neanderthals, known as \"flatheads\" to the Zelandonii and viewed as no better than animals. For the Zelandonii to accept Ayla they must first overcome their prejudice against the Neanderthals. Luckily for Ayla and Jondalar, some of the higher-ranking Zelandonii already have doubts of this misjudgment.\n\nTwo of their number, Echozar and Brukeval, are of partial Neanderthal ancestry and are ashamed of it. Echozar at least is pacified by Ayla's own story and by his (Echozar's) own marriage to Joplaya, Jondalar's close-cousin (half-sister). Brukeval, on the other hand, rejects his heritage utterly and refuses to listen to reason.\n\nJondalar's first romantic interest, Zelandoni, formerly known as Zolena, has now become the First among the spiritual leaders. She supports adopting Ayla into their society, if not least for the healing arts she brings to the cave, although Ayla also must overcome the feeling that she is uncomfortable with a full connection with the spirit world. After Ayla helps a mortally injured hunter live long enough to see his mate, the First senses that Ayla needs to be brought into the fold of the Zelandonia (mystics, named after their culture so as to identify themselves with it) so that she will be accepted as a healer by all the people of the cave.\n\nAt one point, Ayla persuades the native mothers to nurse a neglected infant, on the pretext that even a \"flathead\" would have done so in their place. This both shames them into agreeing (as noted by Jondalar's sister-in-law, Proleva) and educates the Zelandonii in the ways of their ex-neighbors.\n\nAyla is drawn ever closer to an as-yet-undetermined role in the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii. Her knowledge of the healing arts as well as hunting force her to accept a role in the spiritual leadership of the group.\n\nThrough it all Jondalar is waiting for the summer meeting and matrimonial that will finally \"tie the knot\" for the two of them. This has been his ultimate goal since The Valley of Horses. Their daughter, Jonayla, named for her mother's belief a man's \"essence\" creates babies, which leads to Jondalar and Ayla each being part of the baby, not just their spirits, is born sometime after this event. Not long after the birth, Ayla finally decides to become Zelandoni's acolyte, if only so that the members of the Zelandonii will accept her as a healer.\n\nThis book is set in what is now the Vézère valley, near to Les Eyzies, in the Dordogne, southwest France. It was relatively densely populated in prehistoric times, with many open cliff-top dwellings that can still be seen, some of which have been turned into tourist attractions. The national museum of prehistory is located in this valley. Ayla also discovers the world-famous cave of Lascaux, which her adopted people subsequently paint.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His son Adam is seventeen and his daughter Sophie is eight. Despite the outward perfection of his life, Greville is having an affair with sculptor Natalia Jones, an enigmatic mother of two who is married to a husband in politics who cheats on her. Greville's wife is away at the family's country retreat for weeks on end and his children at their respective schools, so Greville enjoys his lover's company with minimal risk of being discovered. However, as smitten with Natalia as Greville is, he has a brief fling with a woman named Madeleine, as well.\n\nIn spite of his easy lifestyle, Greville is not a happy man. \nThe focus of this novel is based on Greville's dissatisfactions and confusions. For instance, although Natalia does not make any demands on him, and his wife prefers not to see what is going on, Greville is torn between the two women. He wants to be with Natalia when he is with his wife and vice versa. What is more, he sees two people in his lover. To Anthony Greville, Natalia is an angelic figure who also symbolizes a diametrical opposite, specifically demonic. This dual perception of his lover leads him call her by two different names (\"Natalie\" and \"Natalia\").\n\nGreville becomes disillusioned with politics, because he feels that political gaming prefers stalemate to partisanship,and therefore, opposes real change. Subsequently, Greville states that he is going to resign from Parliament as soon as possible. This is a startling announcement because Greville comes from a family of politicians, and his son is already active in grassroots politics. However, before his intended resignation, he must complete a final diplomatic mission as an MP; he journeys to Central Africa to meet Ndoula, a controversial freedom fighter who has been imprisoned by the colonial powers. While he is in Africa, without the emotional chaos of his personal life, Greville begins to introspect, writing and trying to make sense of his life.\n\nWhen Greville returns to England, he finds that both his wife and his idealistic son are leaving for Africa in order to help the current crisis. Greville sees them off at the airport, and then returns to Natalia, even though she has not answered his letters from abroad.\n\nAlthough interesting and similar in content and intent to the works of Graham Greene, the plot line of \"Natalie Natalia\" can be construed as \"difficult to follow\" because the linear narration is interrupted by segments where Greville's thoughts, dreams, and fantasies become the focus of the prose.\n\nAn example of such an interruptive/introspective segment in Greville's POV (from Chapter 7) follows :\n[…] I had rowed into the harbour from the sea; the oars had made whirlpools. A light appeared in the window: your breast, above the candle, burned. We wrapped our cloaks round us: ran with our shoulders against the drawbridge. Hands came through the door and held us; they were tendrils through the stone. You watched from an upstairs window. We were in the hallway of the castle. You stood with the candle and one hand against your breast. The candle burned: it made blood against the snow. The man with the beak of a bird put his head down to embrace you: with one arm round his neck, you were a tunnel through which he could breathe. On the stairs were figures in suits of armour.\n\nFirelight flickered. You were laid on a table with one leg raised. The man with the mask of a bird rummaged inside you. He was looking in you like a suitcase. I had been in the cell all winter alone. Turning you on your front, you had been split up the back by an axe. Men in white coats stood around you. They had instruments in their hands with which to handle coals. They flipped them over. You had your face to the wall and were fastened to iron rings. The man with the beak of a bird tore the lining. Hands had come through the wall and held me. Your arms were round the neck of the man with the mask like a swan.\n\nHe reached to the entrails and the liver. Men leaned over tables and shovelled coal. Their pink cheeks glowed. You stood with a hand at your breast and the candle burning you. On the stairs were men in armour; their swords flickered. With your back towards them, they heated irons in the coal. They lifted your leg up and put it on the table. Moving with my hands behind me, I felt an iron ring in the stone. If I pulled, there would be a tunnel: I could put an iron bar across the hole. At the end of it would be a cell. There I had been all winter. […]\n"}

His bravery inspired musical numbers and a novel. He moved to Northern Ireland and is a composer, conductor, and performer. His G minor masterpiece was introduced in a book called \"a story like the wind\".\n\nHe played in the Sarajevo Opera, the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra, The Symphony Orchestra RTV Sarajevo, and the National Theatre of Sarajevo.\n\nSmailović caught the imagination of people around the world by playing his cello, most notably performing Albinoni's \"Adagio in G Minor\" for twenty two days, in the ruined square of a downtown Sarajevo marketplace after a mortar round had killed twenty-two people waiting for food there. He managed to leave Sarajevo 1993, in the second year of the siege that lasted from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996 (1,425 days) and is often mistakenly identified as a member of the Sarajevo String Quartet, which played on throughout the siege.\n\nIn his honour, composer David Wilde wrote a piece for solo cello, \"The Cellist of Sarajevo\", which was recorded by Yo Yo Ma.

After 1980, industrial splintered into a range of offshoots, sometimes collectively named post-industrial music. This list details some of these offshoots, including fusions with other experimental and electronic music genres as well as rock, folk, heavy metal and hip hop. Industrial genres have spread worldwide and are particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan.\n\nIndustrial music comprises many styles of experimental music, including many forms of electronic music. The term was coined in the mid-1970s for Industrial Records artists. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Boyd Rice, SPK, and Z'EV. Test Dept, Clock DVA, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Laibach, and The Leather Nun subsequently participated in the movement. German group Einstürzende Neubauten forged their own style, which mixed metal percussion, guitars and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played.\n\nDark ambient projects like Coil, Lilith, Nurse with Wound, Lustmord, and Zoviet France, evolved out of industrial music during the 1980s. These artists make use of non-musical material and noise, but less abrasively than other post-industrial musicians, bordering more on ambient music. The last material that Throbbing Gristle recorded in the studio, \"In the Shadow of the Sun\" and \"Journey Through a Body\", was ambient, and pointed in the direction that TG's offshoots (notably Coil, Chris & Cosey) would take. Other artists include Long Distance Poison, Hafler Trio, MRT, Kim Cascone, Controlled Bleeding, Nine Inch Nails (on their album \"Ghosts I-IV\"), early Techno Animal, prominent game music composer Akira Yamaoka, Robin Rimbaud, Final and Deutsch Nepal.\n\nElectro-Industrial draws on EBM, and developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and Wumpscut. In the mid-'90s, the style spawned the dark electro and aggrotech offshoots. Other artists include Haujobb, Lab Report, and Leæther Strip.\n\nElectronic body music combines elements of European industrial, German electronic music such as that of Klaus Schulze, music of the Neue Deutsche Welle electropunk scene. It first came to prominence in Belgium. The name was coined by Ralf Hütter of Kraftwerk in 1978 to explain the more physical sound of their album \"The Man-Machine\". The term was later used in its current sense by Belgian group Front 242 in 1984 to describe their EP \"No Comment\", released in the same year. It denotes a certain type of danceable electronic music, a mixture of electropunk and industrial music. Other artists include Armageddon Dildos, Die Krupps, à;GRUMH..., A Split-Second, And One, Bigod 20, The Neon Judgement, and Attrition.\n\nIndustrial hip hop fuses the themes and aesthetics of industrial with hip hop music. Its origins are in the work of Mark Stewart and Adrian Sherwood. In 1985, Stewart, former Pop Group singer, released \"As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade\", applying the cut-up style of industrial music with the house band of Sugar Hill Records (Doug Wimbish, Keith Leblanc, and Skip McDonald). Sherwood was a major figure in British dub music, as well as working with industrial groups such as Cabaret Voltaire, Einstürzende Neubauten, Ministry, KMFDM, and Nine Inch Nails. Tackhead, a collaboration between Sherwood and the Sugar Hill band, picked up where Stewart left off. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, from San Francisco, and Meat Beat Manifesto, from the UK, are also early representatives of the style. The later work of Broadrick's Godflesh, as well as his collaborations with Kevin Martin, Ice, and Techno Animal, are examples of industrial hip hop. Saul Williams, a slam poet, also performs in the style. Other notable contributors include CX KidtroniK, clipping., B L A C K I E, Death Grips, JPEGMafia and Electric Caves.\n\nIndustrial rock artists generally employ the basic rock instrumentation of electric guitars, drums and bass and pair it with white noise blasts, electronic music gear (synthesizers, sequencers, samplers and drum machines). Guitars are commonly heavily distorted or otherwise effected. Bass guitars and drums may be played live, or be replaced by electronic musical instruments or computers. The early fusions of industrial music and rock were practiced by a handful of post-punk groups, including Chrome, Killing Joke, Swans, Big Black, and Foetus. Nine Inch Nails popularized industrial rock in the US with the release of \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and \"The Downward Spiral\". Industrial metal evolved from the scene, and is practiced by groups such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Fear Factory.\n\nJapanoise (a blend of the words \"Japanese\" and \"noise\") is the noise music scene of Japan. Popular and active in the 1980s and 1990s but continuing into the early 21st century, the Japanoise scene is defined by its sense of musical freedom: Groups range from the punk demolition of Hanatarash and its subsequent psychedelic Boredoms evolutions, to the tabletop electronics of Incapacitants and Merzbow. The scene was initially inspired by power electronics and sometimes deals with BDSM themes. Nonetheless, Japanoise is often less serious than other post-industrial styles, and some musicians, such as Aube, are also inspired by psychedelia or space rock.\n\nNeofolk is the music of artists like Douglas Pearce of Death In June, Tony Wakeford of Sol Invictus, and David Tibet of Current 93, who had collaborated with one another. These musicians comprised a post-industrial music circle who incorporated folk music based on traditional European elements. Neofolk can be solely acoustic folk music or a blend of acoustic folk instrumentation with accompanying sounds, such as pianos, strings or elements of industrial music and experimental music. The genre encompasses an assortment of themes including traditional music, heathenry, romanticism and occultism. Neofolk musicians often have ties to other genres such as martial industrial. \"Apocalyptic folk\" predates \"neofolk\" and was used by David Tibet for the music of his band Current 93 during the late 1980s. Initially, Tibet did not intend to imply connection with the folk music genre; rather, that Current 93's music was made by \"apocalyptic folk, or guys.\"\n\nPower electronics was originally coined by William Bennett for the noise music of his own project Whitehouse. It consists of screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, and screamed, distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms. Members of Whitehouse who began other projects, such as Sutcliffe Jügend, also practice power electronics. Death industrial is a similar style associated with groups such as The Grey Wolves, but the term first referred to artists such as Brighter Death Now. The Swedish label Cold Meat Industry issued the releases in this subgenre.\n\nPower noise (also known as rhythmic noise) takes its inspiration from some of the more structured and distorted early industrial acts, such as Esplendor Geométrico. The Belgian group Dive also anticipated the style in the early '90s. Power noise groups meld noise music with various forms of electronic dance music. The term \"power noise\" was coined by Raoul Roucka of Noisex in 1997, with the track \"United (Power Noise Movement)\". Typically, power noise is based upon a distorted kick drum from a drum machine such as a Roland TR-909, uses militaristic 4/4 beats, and is usually instrumental. Sometimes a melodic component is added, but this is almost always secondary to the rhythm. Power noise tracks are typically structured and danceable, but are occasionally abstract. This genre is showcased at the annual Maschinenfest festival in Krefeld, Germany, as well as at Infest in Bradford, UK. Other artists include Imminent Starvation, Axiome, Converter, and Terrorfakt. The German labels Ant-Zen and Hands Productions specialize in the style. \"Technoid\" grew out of the scene, taking inspiration from IDM, experimental techno and noise music. German label Hymen Records is responsible for the term and the style. Artists include Gridlock, Black Lung, Revolution State, and Xingu Hill.\n\nWitch house is a debated term referring to a fusion genre of electronic music that features a prominent hip-hop influence, specifically the 1990s Houston chopped and screwed sound pioneered by DJ Screw. Witch house consists of applying techniques rooted in Swishahouse hip-hop – drastically slowed tempos with skipping, stop-timed beats – with signifiers of noise, drone, or shoegaze, the genre recontextualizes its forebears into a sinister, unprecedented, yet aesthetically referential atmosphere. Witch house is also influenced by hazy 1980s goth bands, including Cocteau Twins, The Cure and Dead Can Dance, as well as being heavily influenced by certain early industrial bands. The use of hip-hop drum machines, noise atmospherics, creepy samples, synthpop-influenced lead melodies, and heavily altered or distorted vocals is also common.\nThe best-selling offshoots of industrial music are industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums. Their success led to an increase in commercial success for some other post-industrial musicians; the Nine Inch Nails remix album \"Further Down the Spiral\", for example, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In it, Mamet discusses the conscious and unconscious processes that go on in developing a work of art.\n\nThe essay, dedicated to Michael Feingold (a critic of \"The Village Voice\"), is divided in three chapters: \"The Wind-Chill Factor\", \"Second Act Problems\", and \"Three Uses of the Knife\".\n\nMamet begins his book by saying that people naturally dramatize everyday occurrences and that life itself is inherently theatrical: \"Our survival mechanism orders the world into cause-effect-conclusion.\" He goes on to explain that the ways in which we dramatize our everyday experiences are not different than 'true drama', particularly tragedy, which—along with myth and religion— creates awe within the audience. True drama enables the spectator to achieve peace by realizing the fact that he or she is powerless to affect the natural order.\n\nThe book's title stems from a quote from musician Lead Belly, appearing on page 66:\n\nAnother more significant quote from the book:\n\"The subject of drama is The Lie. At the end of the drama THE TRUTH -- which has been overlooked, disregarded, scorned, and denied -- prevails. And that is how we know the Drama is done.\"\n"}
{"id": "1832092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832092", "title": "Douro DOC", "text": "Douro DOC\n\nDouro is a Portuguese wine region centered on the Douro River in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Alto Douro\" (upper Douro), as it is located some distance upstream from Porto, sheltered by mountain ranges from coastal influence. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a \"Denominação de Origem Controlada\" (DOC). While the region is associated primarily with Port wine production, the Douro produces just as much table wine (non-fortified wines) as it does fortified wine. The non-fortified wines are typically referred to as \"Douro wines\".\n\nAlto Douro was one of the 13 regions of continental Portugal identified by geographer Amorim Girão, in a study published between 1927 and 1930. Together with Trás-os-Montes it became Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province.\n\nThe style of wines produced in the Douro range from light, Bordeaux-style claret to rich Burgundian-style wines aged in new oak.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence for winemaking in the region dating from the end of the Western Roman Empire, during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, although grape seeds have also been found at older archaeological sites. In Medieval times from the mid-12th century, Cistercians had an important influence on winemaking in the region, through their three monasteries Salzedas, São João de Tarouca and São Pedro das Águias.\n\nIn the 17th century, the region's vineyards expanded, and the earliest known mention of \"Port wine\" dates from 1675. The Methuen Treaty between Portugal and England in 1703, and the subsequent establishment of many British Port lodges in Porto meant that Port wine became the primary product of the region, and it became economically very important to Portugal. As part of the regulation of the production and trade of this valuable commodity, a royal Portuguese charter of 10 September 1756 defined the production region for Port wine. It thus became the world's first wine region to have a formal demarcation. The vineyards covered by this demarcation were situated in the western part of the present region. Later, the vineyards have progressively expanded to the east into hotter and drier areas.\n\nDouro was not spared from the vine diseases of the 19th century. Powdery mildew (oidium) struck in 1852 and Phylloxera in 1863.\n\nWhile table wine has always been produced in the region, for a long time little of it was seen outside the region itself. The Port lodges were focused on the production and export of Port wine, which was their unique product on the export market, and had little interest in other wine styles. Thus, while the wines could be good, for a long time, there was no attempt to use Douro grapes to produce more ambitious table wine. The person credited with creating the first ambitious Douro wine is Fernando Nicolau de Almeida, who worked as an oenologist with the Port house Ferreira. He visited Bordeaux during World War II, which gave him inspiration for creating a top-quality table wine. The wine Barca Velha, first produced in 1952 using grapes from Quinta do Vale de Meão situated in the Douro Superior subregion, was the result. Barca Velha didn't immediately get many followers, since most Port wine houses remained uninterested in non-fortified wines for a long time. A few more ambitious Douro wines made their appearance from the 1970s, but it was not until the 1990s when a large number of wines made their appearance. A contributing factor was Portugal's entry into the European Economic Community in 1986, which meant that the Port lodges' monopoly was abolished, thus paving the way for producers in the Douro valley to produce and bottle their own wine - Port or dry Douro wines. At this stage, several Port houses also introduced Douro wines into their range.\n\nThe Douro winemaking region was declared a World Heritage Site in 2001.\n\nThe Douro wine region is situated around the Douro river valley and lower vallies of its tributaries Varosa, Corgo,\nTávora, Torto, and Pinhão. The region is sheltered from Atlantic winds by the Marão and Montemuro mountains and has a continental climate, with hot and dry summers and cold winters.\n\nIt is usually subdivided into three subregions, from the west to the east:\n\nTerraced vineyards are very common in the Douro region. Vineyards dedicated to Port production are usually planted on schist while areas with granite-based soils are used for table wine production.\n\nThe principal grape varieties of the Douro region include the black grapes Bastardo, Mourisco tinto, Tinta Amarela, Tinta Barroca, Tinta Cão, Tinta Roriz (the same as Spain's Tempranillo), Touriga Francesa and Touriga Nacional, and the white grapes Donzelinho branco, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Rabigato, and Viosinho.\n\nA large number of grape varieties are grown in the Douro region, most of them local Portuguese grapes. For a long time, the grape varieties grown in the Douro were not very well studied. Vineyards of mixed plantation were the norm, and most of the time, the vineyard owners didn't know which grape varieties they were growing. A pioneering effort were made in the 1970s which identified Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca, Tinta Cão and Tinta Barroca as the prime dark-skinned grape varieties. Tinta Amarela and the teinturier Sousão has later come to be included among the varieties that attract the most interest. This work was important for creating the new wave of top Douro wines and has also led to a greater focus on the grape varieties that go into Port wine. Most top quintas now replant with single-variety vineyards and focus on a limited number of varieties, but older, mixed vineyards will remain in production for many decades to come.\n\n"}
{"id": "1832096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832096", "title": "In the Wee Small Hours", "text": "In the Wee Small Hours\n\nIn the Wee Small Hours is the ninth studio album by American vocalist Frank Sinatra. It was released in April 1955 by Capitol and produced by Voyle Gilmore with arrangements by Nelson Riddle. All the songs on the album deal with themes such as loneliness, introspection, lost love, failed relationships, depression and night life. \"In the Wee Small Hours\" has been called one of the first concept albums. The cover artwork reflects these themes, portraying Sinatra on an eerie and deserted street awash in blue-tinged street lights.\n\nHe had been developing this idea since 1946 with his first album, \"The Voice\". He would successfully continue this \"concept\" with later albums such as \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" and \"Only the Lonely\".\n\n\"In the Wee Small Hours\" was issued as two 10-inch LP discs, and also as one 12-inch record LP, making it one of the first of its kind in the pop field. It was also issued as four four–song 45-rpm EP discs sold in cardboard sleeves with the same cover as the LPs, not in paper covers like 45-rpm singles.\n\nThe album was a commercial success, reaching number 2 on the \"Billboard\" album chart, where it stayed for 18 weeks, becoming Sinatra's highest charting album since \"Songs by Sinatra\" in 1947. In 1970 it was re-issued as a ten track album under the name What Is This Thing Called Love?.\n\nIn 2012, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it the 101st greatest album of all time.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the singer saw his career in decline, his teen \"bobby soxer\" audience having lost interest in him as he entered his late 30s. In 1951, he went so far as to attempt suicide, according to one author. Later that year, a second season of \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" was aired on CBS, but failed to receive the same positive reception the first season had, with its host having lost his previous energy. Later, Sinatra was dropped from Columbia.\n\nAgainst the wishes of his colleagues, on March 14, 1953 vice president of A&R at Capitol Alan Livingston signed Sinatra to a seven-year deal. The deal proved to be a success; later that year in August, Sinatra appeared as Private Angelo Maggio in the film \"From Here to Eternity\". The film was successful and his performance was acclaimed, winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. With this new popularity he recorded two 10” LP albums, \"Songs for Young Lovers\" and \"Swing Easy!\", which both peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" album chart, with the latter reaching number five on the UK Album Charts. His performance as the lead character in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" earned him nominations for Best Actor at the Academy Awards and the BAFTA awards.\n\nBy the time he recorded \"In the Wee Small Hours\", Sinatra witnessed the end of several relationships. He and his first wife, Nancy Barbato, separated on Valentine's Day 1950. While still married, he began a relationship with Ava Gardner. After he and Barbato divorced in October 1951, he married Gardner ten days later. But they were both jealous of the other's extramarital affairs. The relationship deteriorated during the recording of \"Songs for Young Lovers\". \n\nDespite considerable influence in getting him a part in \"From Here to Eternity\", Gardner left Sinatra two months after the release of the film, divorcing in 1957. She said, \"We don't have the ability to live together like any normal married couple.\" It is assumed that this album's grouping of \"love gone bad\" songs, and Sinatra's poignant renderings, were a direct result of Sinatra's failing relationship with Gardner, to the point that these are called \"Ava Songs\". \n\nRiddle credited Sinatra's loss of Gardner with his ability to sing the type of songs contained in this album. The failure of this relationship did not shatter Sinatra but instead caused him to sing more emotionally. In the midst of these personal disturbances, Sinatra began selecting songs for a new album. He would rehearse each one of them reiteratively at home with Bill Miller, his pianist.\n\nThe album was designed as a concept album. Albums from the time period tended to be little more than collections of singles, but Sinatra developed a distinction between songs intended as singles for radio airplay and for jukeboxes, and those songs he intended to package together in an album. His sessions intended for album release tend to be more serious, artistically.\n\n\"In the Wee Small Hours\" was recorded before stereophonic technology, but the fidelity of this monophonic album feels \"warm\" to modern ears. The album was recorded in five sessions at KHJ Studios, Hollywood. These sessions took place on February 8, 16, and 17, and April 1 and 4, and would start at 8:00 P.M., continuing to past midnight. The sessions were recorded in Studio C, located downstairs, which was a smaller studio designed to record small ensembles. The first four songs recorded specifically for this album (\"Can't We Be Friends\", \"Dancing on the Ceiling\", \"Glad to Be Unhappy\", \"I'll Be Around\") were not recorded with any brass or strings, but were sparsely arranged. Although the arrangements were Riddle's, there was no need for a conductor, so pianist Bill Miller managed from his instrument.\n\nSet against his then-current relationship troubles, Sinatra set out to record \"angst-ridden\" songs involving lost love. Sinatra was very tense during the recording of the album, reportedly breaking down and crying after the master take of \"When Your Lover Has Gone\". Rita Kirwan of \"Music\" magazine witnessed one of the sessions, and her account goes thus:\n\nNelson Riddle commented on Sinatra's work ethic and its effect on Riddle's arrangements and the studio orchestra:\nSinatra was meticulous about the quality of the sessions for \"In the Wee Small Hours\". Guitarist George Van Eps recalls that Sinatra stopped a session after only singing a few notes because he felt his voice did not have \"the right sound\" at the time. The session was rescheduled for the following night, and Van Eps felt it \"was perfect.\" Sinatra also carefully sequenced the songs, with input from Miller and Riddle, for the LP he personally referred to as \"the Ava album.\"\n\nSinatra's voice was maturing at this point, and he had matured musically regarding intonation and vocal shading. He had also become more comfortable with improvising rhythmically within the confines of Riddle's arrangements. Slight technical imperfections by Sinatra have been found in this recording, but the overall emotional effect compensates completely, so that the listener attributes any shortcomings to the sincere human expressions of the singer.\n\nWith the exception of the title track, the songs are from the Great American Songbook. \"Can't We Be Friends?\" opens with a set of chords on minimalist guitar. Sinatra's interpretation runs from placid to profligate. \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" is among the songs recorded with only a small group. It is a rarity among Riddle arrangements; he rarely created scores for small jazz ensembles.\n\n\"Deep in a Dream\" is identified by critic Will Friedwald as an example of Sinatra's ability to interpret songs in that the song could easily be delivered as \"detached\" or \"hysterical\", but Sinatra finds the perfect balance. The song was considered for inclusion in \"\" but did not make the final cut. \"Glad to Be Unhappy\" was a forgotten song until Sinatra brought it into popular consciousness. In this album it receives small-group jazz treatment.\n\n\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\" is an \"exquisitely ironic\" piece written by Hoagy Carmichael with lyrics based on a poem by Jane Brown Thompson. Although Sinatra's relationship with Gardner ended badly, author James Kaplan suggests this song set the album's mood of \"capitulation, not retaliation\". \"I See Your Face Before Me\" was Nelson Riddle's favorite and was the first song he arranged: he created a setting for it while at Ridgefield High School. The arrangement for \"I'll Be Around\" is a musical pun in that the celesta plays a circular riff. \"I'll Never Be the Same\" uses a \"wind chime\" motif, which came from Riddle's appreciation of French impressionist music. He uses this same mini-theme briefly in \"It Never Entered My Mind\" and in \"Gone With the Wind\" from the 1958 album \"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\". \"Ill Wind\" features extended jazz solos by Harry Edison and Skeets Herfurt.\n\nThe title track came about by happenstance. Composers Bob Hilliard and David Mann were in New York City to visit a publisher. They spotted Sinatra and Riddle and decided to show them their new composition \"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\" Sinatra liked the song and wanted to use it immediately. Sinatra recorded \"It Never Entered My Mind\" in 1947 for Columbia. It was part of the Rodgers and Hart Broadway show \"Higher and Higher\". Ironically, this song, which was a long-time resident in Sinatra's repertoire, was cut from the film version, Sinatra's cinematic debut.\n\nRecorded nearly a year before all other selections, \"Last Night When We Were Young\" was difficult, according to Riddle, because about thirty takes were used. The recording uses a \"low-key\" coda, emphasizing strings and horns, and a brief guitar solo. Sinatra was involved in the production and felt that the guitar solo needed to be slowed considerably. He held Riddle and the musicians in high esteem, so he talked with guitarist George Van Eps about the change, then discussed it separately with Riddle. Van Eps commented, \"Frank was loaded with things like that.\" The finale is a \"cataclysmic climax.\" Sinatra recorded the song with an arrangement by Gordon Jenkins for the album \"September of My Years\" (1965). \"Last Night\" was written for the movie \"Metropolitan\" (1935) but was cut from the final version, appearing only as an instrumental during the credits. The song includes advanced harmonic progressions and a juxtaposition of chromaticism and octave leaps.\n\nIn addition to \"Ill Wind\", \"Mood Indigo\" by Duke Ellington is the purest jazz song on the album. A motif developed by Riddle became the descending riff in Sinatra's hit \"Witchcraft\". Sinatra would include a blues-based selection such as this on each of his \"downbeat\" albums.\n\n\"This Love of Mine\" was recorded by Sinatra in 1941 when he was with the Tommy Dorsey orchestra. In this 1955 version Sinatra gives a more mature reading to the lyrics. Riddle brings a rich arrangement to the harmonically simple song, which assists the mood presented in the album. \"What Is This Thing Called Love\" is noted by Charles Granata for its \"most expressive vocal shading\". Sinatra's voice approaches the bass range at times, and the interpretation is noted for the lyrical liberties Sinatra takes with Porter's lyrics. The song was recorded in 21 takes. \"When Your Lover Has Gone\" had a great effect on Lester Young. Young asked record store clerk Bob Sherrick to \"Let me hear something by my man, Frank.\" \"In the Wee Small Hours\" had been recently released, and Sherrick played this song for Young. Young left the record shop muttering to himself that he had to record it himself on his next session.\n\nThe cover art is designed to set the mood for the music. The cover shows Sinatra on an eerie and deserted street awash in blue-tinged street lights, reflecting the album's themes of introspection, lost love, failed relationships, depression, and night life. It is significant that Sinatra is depicted alone, as loneliness during the \"Wee Small Hours\" is a theme of the album. Rather than at a rakish angle, Sinatra's snap-brim hat is pushed back, suggesting resignation and openness. The artwork is reminiscent of film noir or a hardboiled fiction cover.\n\nThemes of loss and love's bittersweet relationship to loss pervade the album. Yet the ending tone is not one of despair, but of hope and survival as made possible by cathartic reflection. Perhaps given as kindly advice by a person of experience, Jonathan Schwartz believes the album refrains from being \"mushy\" but instead presents the material in a stately manner. Sinatra's next album, \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\", seems to follow up on this promise by depicting an individual who is \"free to enjoy women again\". These two albums well represent the \"heartbroken/hedonistic duality\" of Sinatra's persona in the mid-1950s.\n\nSinatra intended the album to be his first 12-inch LP, but it was initially released as a two-volume set, each set containing eight songs, as a set of 2 ten-inch LPs (Capitol H-581 PT1 and PT2) and as a set of 2 45rpm EP sets, each of 2 discs. The album was released in April 1955. Taken as a whole, the collection is Sinatra's first truly full-length album. Capitol record executives were concerned that an entire album of \"dark\" material would disaffect the record-buying public. It peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, where it remained for 18 weeks, the longest time Sinatra had held a spot in the top-ten at the time, and also his highest charting album since \"Songs by Sinatra\". On September 6, 2002, it was certified Gold by the RIAA, meaning it had shifted over 500,000 units.\n\nIn 1992, the label reissued the CD with all 16 tracks. In 1998 the album was remastered using 20-bit technology under Larry Walsh's supervision at Capitol Recording Studios. Since 1998, recognizing Sinatra's enduring worldwide popularity, \"In the Wee Small Hours\" has been released at least eight times: on vinyl, compact disc, and digital download.\n\nThe album was popular on its release. In the United States the album was listed at number two at its peak and appeared on the charts for eighteen weeks. In August 1962 it re-entered the \"Billboard\" album charts.\n\nSince its release, \"In the Wee Small Hours\" has been regarded as one of Sinatra's best, often ranked with \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956) and \"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\" (1958). It is also considered by many to be one of the best vocal jazz releases of all time. It received immediate critical acclaim on its release. Acclaimed Music, a website which aggregates musical accolades, names \"...Hours\" the 3rd most acclaimed album of the 1950s (\"...Swingin' Lovers!\" being one place behind it), with \"Kind of Blue\" by Miles Davis and Elvis Presley's self titled début album in front. It also names the album the 322nd most acclaimed album of all time.\n\nIn 2000 it was voted number 359 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\".\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine commented in AllMusic that the album had an authentic melancholy mood, and is \"one of Sinatra's most jazz-oriented performances\". Another critic called the album \"...perhaps the definitive musical evocation of loneliness\".\n\nWriting for \"The New Yorker\", Andy Friedman credits \"In the Wee Small Hours\" with changing the purpose of an LP from a mere collection of singles into an art form capable of high literature.\n\nThe album marks a turning point for Sinatra, the beginning of Sinatra's \"mature\" singing style, carrying with it both depth of emotive expression and willingness to experiment rhythmically. Sinatra's relationship with Gardner had previously largely been unaccepted by the general public. John Rockwell believes it was this album, because of the genuine emotional palette on display, that changed the perception of the \"validity\" of the ill-fated romance.\n\nDirectly before Sinatra's funeral service, songs from \"the Ava album\" were played by a trio led by Bill Miller.\n\nCharles Granata opines that this album of ballads best defines Sinatra and the era in which it was recorded. The title track, \"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\", has been recorded by a number of artists following Sinatra's version, including Johnny Hartman, Astrud Gilberto, Lou Rawls, Carly Simon, Art Blakey, Count Basie and His Orchestra, Andy Williams, Wes Montgomery, Ruby Braff, Jamie Cullum, John Mayer, Susan Wong, and many others. A cover version of the title track is also featured as the last track on Curtis Stigers' 2009 album, Lost in Dreams. In his autobiography, B.B. King speaks about how he was a \"Sinatra nut\" and how he went to bed every night listening to \"In the Wee Small Hours.\" Tom Waits has named it one of his favourite albums.

{"id": "1832101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832101", "title": "Dão DOC", "text": "Dão DOC\n\nDão is a Portuguese wine region situated in the Região Demarcada do Dão with the Dão-Lafões sub region of the Centro, Portugal. It is one of the oldest established wine regions in Portugal. Dão wine is produced in a mountainous region with a temperate climate, in the area of the Rio Mondego and Dão rivers in the north central region of Portugal. The region became a \"Denominação de Origem Controlada\" (DOC) appellation in 1990. The Dão region is the origin of the Touriga Nacional vine that is the principal component of port wine.\n\nThe wine region is located primarily on a plateau that is sheltered on three sides by the granite mountain ranges of Serra da Estrela, Serra do Caramulo and Serra da Nave. This helps the area maintain its temperate climate away from the effects of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The region experiences abundant rainfall in the winter months and long, warm dry summers leading up to harvest. The region's vineyards are planted on sandy well-drained soil on top of granite rock.\n\nThe first efforts to have the Dão region recognized as a separate and unique wine region came mainly from the aristocrat and winemaker João de Sacadura Botte Côrte-Real. Considered to be \"the most enlightened viticulturist of his generation\", he modernized the processes of winemaking and raised the standards of the wine produced in the region. He had many wine estates, in both Portugal and Spain, but the most celebrated were his Quinta da Aguieira and his wife's Quinta da Bica.\n\nThe Dão was first officially recognized as a \"Região Demarcada\" in 1908. In the 1940s, to improve the quality of the wine from the region and promote some sort of national identity, the government of Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar instituted new regulations establishing the mandatory use of co-operatives in the region. These co-operatives would have exclusive privilege to the grapes grown in the region and were charged with making the wine that would be sold to private merchants. Despite its intent, the regulations had an adverse effect on the Dão wine region by promoting stagnation due to lack of competition, with some co-operative firms releasing inferior quality wine and even practicing un-hygienic winemaking. In 1979, Portugal's application to the European Union prompted authorities to overturn these rules, as the EU discouraged monopolistic practices in the wine industry.\n\nThe area is home to several dozen varieties of indigenous grapes, with the majority of wine production being made from the Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Jaen, Alfrocheiro Preto and Encruzado. 80% of the region's production is in red wines, with DOC regulations stipulating that at least 20% of the production must be from Touriga Nacional. Some of the top reserve wine may carry the designation \"Dão nobre\" (meaning noble Dão). Another reserve designation, \"Garrafeira,\" requires wines to be 0.5% higher in alcohol content then the 12.5% minimum and to spend at least two years in aging in oak. The maximum yield for red wine grapes is 70 hl/ha.\n\nThe red wines tend to be very tannic due to prolonged periods of maceration during winemaking. Many producers make liberal use of French and Portuguese oak. The style has been improving, with some producers concentrating on making more fruit-forward styles with smoother tannins. Historically, the white wines were known for being over-oxidized and full-bodied, but more modern winemaking has been producing white wines that are fresh, fruity and fragrant. The Encruzado is the principal grape of the area's whites, with some blends of Malvasia Fina and Bical.\"Garrafeira\" white wines require at least 0.5% more alcohol by volume than the 11.5% DOC minimum and at least 6 months aging in oak. The maximum allowable yields for white wine grapes is 80 hl/ha.\n\nThere are seven subregions within Dão which may be indicated on labels together with Dão:\n\n\n"}

The film had a total of 682,295 admissions in France.\n\nInsurer Charles Desvallées lives in a beautiful house in the countryside near Paris with his wife Hélène and their young son. He works in the city in a leisurely job, often drinking and smoking. His wife often goes to Paris for shopping, beauty treatments and cinema sessions.\n\nBy accident he discovers she was not at the hairdresser when she was meant to be. He gradually grows more suspicious about the way she employs her time and asks a private investigator to follow her. The embarrassed detective duly reports that his wife sees a writer called Victor Pégala, at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, several times a week. Hélène appears in bed with Pégala, exchanging titbits about their respective lives. The writer is divorced with two children.\n\nOn a day his wife is busy hosting a birthday party for their son, Desvallées pays Pégala a visit. At first he tells the confused writer jovially that he and his wife have an open marriage and sits and talks pleasantly with him. He asks for a tour of the small flat. On seeing the bed his demeanour changes, as he pictures his wife there. He spots a giant cigarette lighter at the bedside. This had been a 3rd anniversary present to his wife from him. He starts to feel unwell and suddenly grabs a stone bust and kills Pégala with a violent blow to the head.\n\nDesvallée calms down and meticulously cleans up and removes all fingerprints. He then brings his car round near the back gate, bundles up the body, and drags it in broad daylight but in a quiet neighbourhood to the car, where he stuffs it in the boot.\n\nEn route he is rear-ended by a van after braking distractedly. Desvallée nearly panics and hurries the formalities with the other driver as a crowd assembles and a policeman remarks that his boot is now jammed. He dumps the body into a murky pond where it takes an agonisingly long time to sink.\n\nA day or two later, Hélène is grumpy and unwell. Two detectives turn up in the daytime to interrogate her about Victor Pégala, who has been reported missing by his ex-wife. They have found her name and details in the missing man's address book. She is flustered and avoids giving direct answers as to how she knew Victor. In the evening, she mentions the disappearance to her husband, claiming Pégala was only a vague acquaintance. The detectives return and interrogate both Hélène and Charles, who denies having even heard of the man before.\n\nHélène finds a photograph of Victor in her husband's jacket pocket with his name and address on the back. She looks as if she is going to confront him but she goes outside and burns it. Her emotions are difficult to read.\n\nIn the final scene the family is in their garden when the two policemen walk up the drive. Charles tells Hélène that he \"loves her madly\" and goes to speak to the police. The camera then moves back to the wife and child, slowly panning until they disappear hidden by soft focus foliage as Charles is presumably taken away from them.\n\n\nThe film was commercially unsuccessful in France (only 682,295 admissions) but was praised by critics. \"The New York Times\" said that \"in concept and execution, it is a film so calmly and thoughtfully perverse that it can have been born only in the unique cinematic imagination of Claude Chabrol.\" \"Time Out\" called it \"one of Chabrol's mid-period masterpieces, a brilliantly ambivalent scrutiny of bourgeois marriage and murder.\" Derek Malcolm wrote in \"The Guardian\" that \"Chabrol displays an irrestistible logic and an ironic humour\", and \"what could have been just another thriller becomes... also a passionate love story, with its share of intense irony and a pervading sense of the quirkiness of fate.\" \"TV Guide\" called it \"arguably the best of Chabrol's superb, Hitchcockian studies of guilt, love, and murder among the French elite\", and said that \"Michel Bouquet and Stéphane Audran... give perhaps the finest performances of their careers.\"\n\nIt was remade in Filipino in 1995 as Sa ngalan ng pag-ibig & in American English in 2002 as \"Unfaithful\", directed by Adrian Lyne. In 2004 it was remade twice in Hindi. One was Hawas & the other one was Murder. It was also remade in Kannada, which is another Indian language as Ganda Hendathi.\n\n"}

Cook (1840/1842 – April 2, 1907) was an American western lawman and City Marshal of Denver, Colorado, responsible for over 3,000 arrests.\n\nCook was born near La Porte, Indiana. Growing up, he worked as a farmhand before moving to Kansas in 1855, and then in 1859 to Gilpin County, Colorado, looking to prospect for gold.\n\nIn 1861 he joined the Colorado Cavalry upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, and was later assigned to counterespionage for the Union Army, tracking Confederate spies, investigating gold smuggling and similar crimes. \n\nHis success led him to found the \"Rocky Mountain Detective Association\", a freelance, volunteer-only group of Colorado troubleshooters, similar in character to the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Although its offices were in Denver, its cases took him all over the west. From 1866 to 1869, Cook served as marshal of Denver, as well as acting as a federal marshal and range detective.\n\nIn 1868 Cook tracked down the notorious Musgrove-Franklin Gang, who were credited with twelve murders, and apprehended gang leader L. H. Musgrove in the Wyoming Territory. Having subsequently transported Musgrove to jail in Denver, Cook cleverly predicted his partner Ed Franklin would attempt a rescue. Upon Franklin's arrival into Denver, Cook tracked him to a room in the Overland Hotel. Franklin reportedly reached for a pistol and Cook shot him to death. \n\nIn 1878, Cook helped quell a major revolt of the Ute tribe in Colorado. In 1880, he served as the arbitrator in a silver mine strike at Leadville, Colorado.\n\nIn 1882 Cook published a memoir titled \"Hands Up! or Thirty-five Years of Detective Work in the Mountains and on the Plains\", either writing it himself or dictating it to another. It is rumored to have been ghostwritten by Thomas F. Dawson, editor of the Denver Times and personal secretary to Senator Henry Teller. Although a purported autobiography, it is written entirely in the third person. It remains the sole major source of knowledge about Cook's life and accomplishments.\n\nCook lived in Denver until his death. He was buried in Denver's Riverside Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

A defender, he began his career at Chelsea, turning professional in May 1990 and then making his debut in the Football League in April 1991. He played on loan at West Bromwich Albion from December 1991 and March 1992. He established himself in the first-team back at Chelsea during the 1992–93 Premier League campaign and went on to be named as the club's Player of the Year for 1993. He played on the losing side in the 1994 FA Cup final, before picking up a winners medal after Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 2–0 in the 1997 final. Chelsea also won the League Cup by beating Middlesbrough 2–0 in the final the following year, and Sinclair scored the opening goal in extra-time. Chelsea also won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1998, though Sinclair was ruled out of the final due to injury.\n\nHe was sold on to Leicester City in August 1998 for a fee of £2 million. He won his second League Cup final in 2000, as Leicester defeated Tranmere Rovers 2–1. He spent a total of six seasons at Leicester, five of which were spent in the Premier League, the exception being the 2002–03 First Division promotion campaign. He joined Championship club Burnley on a free transfer in June 2004 and served as club captain from January 2005 to summer 2006. He joined League One side Huddersfield Town on an emergency loan in February 2007, which became a permanent transfer in the summer. He dropped into League Two to join Lincoln City in July 2008, who loaned him out to Wycombe Wanderers in March 2009; he helped Wycombe to win promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2008–09 season. He then spent the next two seasons in the Conference with Wrexham, before playing for Hendon in November 2011 and Colwyn Bay in January 2012.\n\nBorn in England, he was called up to represent Jamaica at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and played five games as the team finished in fourth-place after losing to Brazil in the third-place play-off match. He also played all three of his country's games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He went on to feature twice in the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup and ended his international career in October 2003 after a total of 28 caps.\n\nSinclair was appointed as player-manager at Colwyn Bay in February 2013 and was named as Conference North Manager of the Month in April and December 2013. He went on to serve Brackley Town as caretaker-manager in October 2015 and served as Hednesford Town manager from December 2015 to April 2016. He later spent time as a coach at Stoke City, Radcliffe and Port Vale. He is married with three children.\n\nSinclair was born in the London Borough of Lambeth and grew up in Clapham. He attended Pimlico School in Westminster and was offered trials at Chelsea, Arsenal and Wimbledon whilst he represented the West London district team. He later joined Chelsea as an eleven-year-old, stating that supporting the club was a major influence in his decision making. He progressed through the youth age groups, going on to sign as an apprentice in April 1988, before turning professional in May 1990. In April 1991, after a run of four consecutive defeats, Chelsea manager Bobby Campbell decided to blood some youngsters at Luton Town. Sinclair was chosen out of position at left-back, but impressed on his debut as Chelsea fought back from 3–0 down to draw the match 3–3 despite having ten men for the whole of the second-half. He kept his place in the side for the next three fixtures at left-back but was subbed off at half-time in a 7–0 away defeat to Nottingham Forest and then rested for the remainder of the 1990–91 season.\n\nHe made his first appearance of the 1991–92 campaign in Chelsea's first away game, a disappointing 3–0 defeat to Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park. After this performance he was dropped from the side and failed to make a matchday squad under manager Ian Porterfield. In December 1991 he was sent on a short loan spell at Third Division side West Bromwich Albion to gain some more experience. He impressed on his Albion debut, which came in a 1–1 draw away at Bradford City on 14 December. In only his second appearance for the club, he was sent off for violent conduct in the draw with Exeter City when he was involved in a clash of heads with referee Paul Alcock. Despite video evidence showing that the \"butting\" was accidental he was still found guilty by the FA and received a nine match ban and a £600 fine. He remained at The Hawthorns and went on to make a total of six appearances for the \"Baggies\", scoring once before returning to Chelsea in March 1992. He made his comeback for Chelsea in a 1–0 victory over Norwich City in March and made a further six appearances that season, scoring his first Chelsea goal with a header in the 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa in April.\n\nAn ankle injury kept Sinclair out of the side at the beginning of the 1992–93 season. He returned to the side on September in a televised match against Manchester City that Chelsea won 1–0. However, Sinclair's mentor, Paul Elliott, suffered a career ending injury in the match. Despite this setback Sinclair managed to make a total of thirty-nine appearances in all competitions, primarily at left-back, as Chelsea finished in mid-table. His impressive performances earned him the Chelsea Player of the Year award in 1993. Glenn Hoddle was appointed as manager for the 1993–94 season, replacing David Webb, and preferred using a sweeper system which saw Sinclair convert into a central defender. He excelled in this position, however, the team's performances were poor and the side were involved in a relegation battle for the most of the campaign. Despite their poor league form Chelsea made it to the 1994 FA Cup Final against Manchester United at Wembley Stadium, their first major cup final since 1972. Chelsea could not prevent United from claiming the league and cup double in a 4–0 defeat, with Sinclair conceding the penalty for a foul on Andrei Kanchelskis in the second-half, which was scored by Eric Cantona to make it 2–0. Despite the defeat Chelsea qualified for the next seasons UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as runners-up, their first European campaign in over twenty years.\n\nSinclair scored on the opening day of the 1994–95 season with a composed finish in a 2–0 win over Norwich City at Stamford Bridge. He scored four minutes into his debut in European football with a header in a 4–2 win over Czech side Viktoria Žižkov in the Cup Winners' Cup. He played in all but one of the European matches as Chelsea reached the semi-finals, where they were knocked out by Real Zaragoza 4–3 on aggregate. Chelsea again had a disappointing league campaign, finishing in 11th-position, but Sinclair went on to have his best return for the \"Blues\" with 47 appearances in all competitions, also chipping in with further goals against Queens Park Rangers and Wimbledon. However he featured just 15 times in the 1995–96 campaign.\n\nHe also found first-team appearances limited under player-manager Ruud Gullit during the 1996–97 season. However he made six appearances in the FA Cup and was one of three centre-backs – the others being Frank Leboeuf and Steve Clarke – to start in the 1997 final as they beat Middlesbrough 2–0 to lift the trophy. The following season, Sinclair played in the 1997 FA Charity Shield as Chelsea lost on penalties to Manchester United after he missed the opening penalty. On 9 August, he hit the headlines after celebrating a goal against Coventry City by dropping his pants; he later explained he did this in tribute to his newborn daughter. He went on to score for Chelsea in the League Cup final, again over Middlesbrough, in a 2–0 win. His first team chances were starting to become limited though, as new manager Gianluca Vialli built a new team, which consisted mostly of continental stars including centre-backs Frank Leboeuf and Marcel Desailly, whilst John Terry was coming through the youth-team. He missed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final victory over VfB Stuttgart due to a calf injury, though did make five appearances in the competition.\n\nSinclair was sold on to Leicester City in August 1998, for a fee of £2 million. During his time at Filbert Street Sinclair developed an unfortunate reputation for scoring own goals. This was caused initially by two own goals in consecutive weekends in 1999. The first was a great leap at Highbury to give Arsenal a 2–1 win. He managed to refrain from putting through his own net against Coventry City the following Wednesday, but then scored another at home to former club Chelsea, where he beat Tore André Flo to the ball to smash it into his own net and lose Leicester their one-goal lead. The importance of these goals was accentuated by the fact that both came in the last minute of the match, and both caused Leicester to drop points, although it wasn't enough to prevent him from remaining a first-team regular.\n\nHe scored two goals in 39 appearances throughout the 1998–99 season, helping Martin O'Neill's \"Foxes\" to a 10th-place finish. Six of his appearances came in the League Cup, though he was not in the matchday squad for the final, a 1–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He appeared 44 times in the 1999–2000 campaign and this time was part of the team that played in the League Cup final, and collected his second winners medal in the competition as Leicester triumphed 2–1 over Tranmere Rovers thanks to a brace from centre-back partner Matt Elliott.\n\nHowever he was limited to 19 appearances by manager Peter Taylor during the 2000–01 season. He was then fined two weeks wages by Leicester in September 2001 for his part in an incident at a Heathrow hotel. Sinclair, along with four Chelsea players, had gone on a five-hour drinking binge and had stripped off, swore and vomited in front of American tourists just hours after the September 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people in America. He did though go on to re-establish himself in the starting eleven under new manager Dave Bassett. On 2 March 2002, Sinclair scored the most bizarre of his own goals. After 3 minutes into a game at Middlesbrough, he coolly slotted the ball past keeper Ian Walker in a seemingly laid-back situation in what proved to be the game's only goal. He held the Premier League records for most own goals, until his record was overtaken by Richard Dunne.\n\nLeicester finished the 2001–02 season in last-place and were relegated out of the Premier League. They then made an immediate return to the top-flight in 2002–03, crowning their maiden season at the Walkers Stadium with a second-place finish in the First Division, Sinclair featuring in 37 games. In March 2004, Sinclair and his Leicester City teammates, Paul Dickov and Keith Gillespie were arrested in Spain over sexual assault charges, while on a training holiday. The charges were later dropped. Leicester released Sinclair following the club's relegation at the end of the 2003–04 season.\n\nIn June 2004, Sinclair joined Championship side Burnley on a free transfer, signing a one-year contract. He made his debut for the club on 7 August in the opening match of the 2004–05 season against Sheffield United. He struck up an impressive partnership at the centre of the defence with fellow new recruit John McGreal at the start of the season, starting in the majority of games. On 24 December, Sinclair signed a new two-year contract extension until June 2007, with \"Clarets\" manager Steve Cotterill stating that \"he has been an integral part of our defence\". In January 2005, he was appointed as captain following the departure of Robbie Blake to Birmingham City. On 5 February, he was sent off in the local derby defeat to Leeds United after receiving two bookings. His first goal for the club came from a header on 12 March, in a 2–1 win over Rotherham United at Turf Moor. Towards the end of the season he received plaudits for his impressive partnership with young loan signing Gary Cahill and made a total of 42 appearances in his first season with the club as the side finished in mid-table.\n\nHe remained a regular during the 2005–06 season but more often than not he was asked to play out at right-back rather than his preferred central position, even playing when not fully fit due to the side's injury problems. On 1 November, he was on the receiving end of alleged racism in a 2–1 win over Millwall, with opposing player Ben May being sent-off in the tunnel at half-time for words said to Sinclair. However, both players later denied that the incident happened. He made a total of 40 appearances in all competitions as Burnley finished in 17th-place.\n\nAt the start of the 2006–07 season, with Sinclair's first team place no longer assured, Steve Cotterill handed over the captaincy to new signing Wayne Thomas. He played invariably at the start of the season and usually played in the right-back position. On 18 November, he was sent-off in the 3–0 away defeat to West Bromwich Albion for two bookings in what was his hundredth appearance for the club. Whilst suspended and injured he lost his place in the side and struggled to regain it. His final game for the Burnley came on 23 January in a 1–0 home defeat to Stoke City. He made a total of 102 appearances for Burnley, scoring only once.\n\nOn 8 February 2007, Sinclair moved to Huddersfield Town on an emergency loan deal. On 24 March, he was sent off against Brighton & Hove Albion in a match which finished 0–0. Upon his return to Burnley, he was released on a free transfer and went on to sign a one-year contract at Huddersfield Town on 14 May. He cited manager Andy Ritchie as a reason for staying on: \"he's been successful in League One before\", he told the club's media team. On 6 October, he received his second red card of his short career at the Galpharm Stadium, in Town's 4–0 drubbing at Walsall. He received his third sending off during Town's 4–1 defeat at Southend United on 5 December. Huddersfield released Sinclair at the end of his contract in May 2008.\n\nSinclair signed a one-year contract with League Two side Lincoln City on 1 July 2008, reuniting with manager Peter Jackson who originally brought him to Huddersfield Town. Jackson hailed Sinclair's \"determination, his personality and his will to win\", and said that both Wycombe Wanderers and Brighton & Hove Albion were interested in signing the player. On 26 March 2009, Sinclair made the surprise move to Wycombe Wanderers on loan from Lincoln City; former Leicester manager Peter Taylor was in charge at Adams Park. His presence helped the \"Chairboys\" to achieve promotion from League Two. In May 2009, He left Sincil Bank after being released in May 2009.\n\nBoth Wycombe and Bury had expressed interest in signing Sinclair for the 2009–10 season, but he eventually signed a one-year deal with Conference Premier club Wrexham. On 9 March 2010, he was sent off after breaking the leg of Tom Kearney in a 1–1 draw with Altrincham, though said the challenge didn't warrant a red card. He was sent off again 21 days later, and also scored an own goal and gave away a penalty in a 2–2 draw at AFC Wimbledon. He played a major role for the \"Red Dragons\" in the 2010–11 season, he played in the play-off semi-final against Luton Town, where Wrexham lost 3–0 in the first leg and 2–1 in the second (5–1 on aggregate). He left the Racecourse Ground in July 2011 after failing to agree a new contract on reduced terms with manager Dean Saunders.\n\nSinclair signed for Hendon of the Isthmian League Premier Division on 11 November 2011, as a favour to Junior Lewis. On 6 January 2012, he joined up with Conference North side Colwyn Bay. He made his debut the next day and scored an injury-time winning goal as the \"Seagulls\" beat Altrincham 4–3. He was appointed player-manager at Llanelian Road on 11 February 2013.\n\nSinclair was eligible to represent England through birth and also qualified for Jamaica through his parents who were born in the country. Following on from his impressive form for Chelsea in the 1994–95 season, he was called up by Terry Venables to the England squad for the Umbro Cup final match against Brazil in June 1995. However, he failed to make an appearance and this proved to be his only call-up to the side.\n\nDespite wanting to represent England at international level, an opportunity to represent Jamaica arose early in November 1997 following their qualification to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Manager René Simões had called up a number of English-born players such as Deon Burton, Robbie Earle, Paul Hall, and Fitzroy Simpson in the qualification matches and wanted Sinclair to join the group. Sinclair stated, \"I was playing the best football of my career and was still not involved with England. Jamaica came up and I thought an opportunity like that might never happen again so I took it.\" He was called up to the squad for the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup held in February, making his debut in the opening group stage match against Brazil, which finished in a 0–0 draw at the Miami Orange Bowl. He played in the remaining two group stage games as Jamaica qualified for the knockout stage with wins over Guatemala and El Salvador. Jamaica were knocked out in the semi-finals due to a 1–0 golden goal defeat to Mexico, and finished in fourth place overall as they lost to Brazil in the third-place play-off match. Sinclair made a total of five appearances in the tournament.\n\nSinclair was included in the Jamaica squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France, making history as they became the first English-speaking Caribbean country to qualify for a World Cup. He started in all three group matches against Croatia, Argentina and Japan. Jamaica lost the opening two games but claimed their first ever points at a World Cup with the 2–1 victory over Japan in Lyon, but were still eliminated finishing third in the group. Over the next couple of years Sinclair represented the side in a number of friendly matches and was included in the squad for the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He played in the two group stage matches, a 1–0 defeat to Colombia and 2–0 defeat to Honduras as Jamaica were knocked out at the first stage.\n\nIn July 2000, the newly appointed Jamaica technical director of football, Clovis de Oliveria, decided to axe the five based British-based players, including Sinclair, from the upcoming 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for \"disciplinary reasons\". However, Sinclair was later re-instated into the side and appeared in four qualifying matches in June and September 2001, but Jamaica failed to qualify for the World Cup after only winning two of their ten matches. It was two years before he made another appearance for the side and in August 2003 Sinclair stated that his appearance in the summer friendly against Nigeria would be \"more than likely\" his last appearance for Jamaica. He wanted to give the younger players a chance of breaking into the team and wished to focus on his club career with Leicester City, stating that the transatlantic travel could affect his form. In September 2003, he reversed his decision and was included in the squad for the friendly against Australia played at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, Berkshire. The friendly against Brazil in Leicester in October 2003 proved to be his final appearance for Jamaica, with Sinclair earning a total of twenty-eight caps.\n\nAfter being appointed player-manager, Sinclair helped save Colwyn Bay from relegation and was named as Conference North Manager of the Month for April 2013 after overseeing six successive victories. He credited his success to new signings Shelton Payne and Jamie Ellison, as well as veteran midfielder Fraser McLachlan. He signed a new one-year contract in the summer. In July he convinced veteran striker Ade Akinbiyi to join the club. Sinclair was again named as Manager of the Month after winning all five matches in December 2013. He was named as the bookies favourite for the vacant Wrexham management post in February 2014. Sinclair led Colwyn Bay to a 12th-place finish in the 2013–14 season, the highest finish in the club's history. On 5 January 2015, he resigned as manager of Colwyn Bay, a day after a 5–0 defeat to Boston United which left the club 11 points outside the play-off places. He went on to work as a youth-team coach at Oldham Athletic.\n\nHe featured \"intermittently\" for struggling Conference North side Brackley Town in the 2014–15 season. After the resignation of Jon Brady, Sinclair was appointed as the club's caretaker-manager on 8 September 2015, until Kevin Wilkin was appointed 12 days and three draws later.\n\nOn 15 December 2015, Sinclair was appointed manager of Conference North club Hednesford Town. On 2 March 2016, he resigned with the \"Pitmen\" bottom of the division having won only two of his 13 league matches in charge. However he was reinstated just two days later after chairman Steve Price persuaded him to reconsider his resignation. Town lost just two of their first six games of his second spell in charge, but Sinclair left the club permanently on 15 April, just days after stating his intention to stay on at Keys Park for the following season.\n\nSinclair began working as Stoke City's under-23 assistant manager in December 2016. He joined Radcliffe as assistant to manager Jon Macken in September 2017. He began coaching at Port Vale in March 2020, following an invite from assistant manager Dave Kevan.\n\nSinclair now lives in Lostock, Bolton, having previously resided in Weybridge, Surrey, and is married to Nicola Wealleans. He has three children, Lee (born 1991), Cherelle (born 1997) and Tyrese (born 2001). Tyrese previously played in the youth team of Blackburn Rovers but was released from the club in 2017. Tyrese turned professional with Mansfield Town in July 2019.\n\nIn September 2005, Sinclair was found guilty of drink driving at Bolton Magistrates' Court and was banned from driving for three years and given a £2,000 fine.\n\nChelsea\n\nLeicester City\n\nWycombe Wanderers\n\nColwyn Bay\n"}

The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a \"Denominação de Origem Controlada\" (DOC). It is located close to the Atlantic which ocean currents have a moderating effect on the climate. The region is bordered to the north by the Lafões IPR and to the east by the Dão DOC. The region is known for its deep colored tannic red wines that often have bell pepper and black currant flavors as well its emerging rosé production. The boundaries of the Bairrada DOC includes the municipalities of Anadia, Cantanhede, Mealhada and Oliveira do Bairro.\n\nViticulture in the Bairrada has existed since at least the 10th century, when the region gained independence from the Moors. Located just south of the major Port wine producing center of Oporto, the fortunes of Bairrada were on the upswing during the 17th century when Port producers, eager to supply the growing British market, would blend Bairrada wines with the product coming from the Douro.\n\nThe principal grapes of the Bairrada region includes Baga, Borrado das Moscas, Castelão Frances, Fernao Pires, Rabo de Ovelha and Tinta Pinheira.\n\n"}

The manner of his execution is frequently cited by opponents of capital punishment in the United States. Evans was born in Beaumont, Texas and died in Atmore, Alabama at the age of 33.\n\nAfter his 1976 parole from an Indiana prison, Evans and fellow convict Wayne Ritter (January 30, 1954 - August 28, 1987) embarked on a two-month-long crime spree involving, by Evans's own admission, over thirty armed robberies, nine kidnappings, and two extortion schemes across seven states. On January 5, 1977 he and Ritter robbed and killed Edward Nassar, a pawn shop owner in Mobile, Alabama, while his two young daughters were in the store. The perpetrators fled, but were captured on March 7 by FBI agents in Little Rock, Arkansas. Among the evidence recovered was the gun used to shoot Nassar in the back, and another gun stolen from the pawn shop.\n\nAlthough he gave a detailed confession, prosecutors refused to accept his plea of guilty because they wanted Evans sentenced to death, and under Alabama law, this is only allowed following a conviction by a jury. Evans was tried in State Circuit Court in Mobile, Alabama on April 26, 1977 for first-degree murder committed during commission of a robbery. During the trial, Evans again admitted to his crime and stated that he did not feel remorse and that under the same circumstances he would kill again. Furthermore, he threatened that if the jury did not sentence him to death, he would escape and murder each of them. Despite his testimony, the jury was instructed to consider all the evidence and to return a verdict of guilty only if the prosecutors had left no reasonable doubt. The jury convicted Evans of the capital offense charged, thus imposing the death penalty, after less than fifteen minutes of deliberation.\n\nUnder Alabama law, all capital sentences must by affirmed by review in higher court. The sentence of death was confirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and by the Alabama Supreme Court, which set the date of April 6, 1979 for his execution.\n\nOn April 2, Evans' mother Betty, acting as \"next friend\", petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama for a writ of \"habeas corpus\". The application requested the Court to find Evans's conviction to be unconstitutional because consideration of lesser included offenses was not offered the jury. The District Court dismissed her application on the grounds that she was not entitled to act as \"next friend\". She appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which overturned the District Court's decision and, in fact, judged the initial criminal conviction to be invalid. In 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the state's petition for a writ of certiorari, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and returning to them the decision on the constitutionality of Evans's sentence.\n\nThis finding was made with two of the justices (William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall) entering an opinion \"concurring in part and dissenting in part,\" because they accepted the argument of the State of Alabama on the matter in question, but held that capital punishment itself was \"cruel and unusual punishment\", prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn July of that year, Evans fired his lawyers and filed a motion to dismiss all further appeals. The Court of Appeals accepted his motion on October 19, 1982. A subsequent application for a new sentencing hearing was rejected by the Alabama Supreme Court on February 18, 1983 and execution was carried out at Holman Prison, near Atmore, Alabama, on April 22.\n\nThe execution is notable for its imprecision. The means of carrying out the sentence of death used at Holman Prison was an electric chair constructed by an inmate in 1927. The chair was nicknamed \"Yellow Mama\" because of its traffic-yellow coat of paint. It had not been used since 1965, after which a series of Supreme Court decisions created an effective moratorium on executions in the United States until the constitutionality of the death penalty was affirmed by the Court in \"Gregg v. Georgia\" (1976).\n\nThe execution was witnessed by reporter Mark Harris, who wrote this published on May 4, 1983.\nThe following description of Evans' electrocution was sworn by Evans' attorney, Russell F. Canan, on June 22, 1983:\nShortly before his execution, Evans was featured in an After School Special called \"Dead Wrong\" in which he shared his life story with young people and pleaded for them not to make the mistakes he did that led to the electric chair. The program makes no reference to the multiple shocks required to end Evans' life.\n\nEvans' accomplice, Wayne Ritter, was electrocuted on August 28, 1987.\n\n\n"}

It is the third novel featuring the anti-hero Takeshi Kovacs and is the sequel to \"Broken Angels\".\n\nThis addition to the series casts light upon Kovacs' early life providing information on his post-envoy activities.\n\nMorgan's official website and interviews suggest that \"Woken Furies\" could be the last Kovacs novel, although in 2018 Morgan stated that the Netflix adaptation has \"kind of woken it all up again\" after all these years, making him possibly reconsider being done with Kovacs.\n\nTakeshi Kovacs finds himself in a new \"sleeve,\" or human body, back on his home planet of Harlan's World. He is on the run after making numerous attacks against the Knights of the New Revelation, an extremist religious order responsible for the death of his lost love and her daughter. Because she had violated tenets about resleeving, her executioners dropped her and her daughter's cortical stacks in the sea, effectively preventing them from being resleeved (into new bodies). \n\nWhile trying to secure passage after his most recent attack, Kovacs saves a woman named Sylvie from a group of religious zealots. In return, she allows him to take refuge with her mercenary \"deCom\" crew as they head out to decommission sentient military hardware that has run amok on the island of New Hokkaido (AKA New Hok). Sylvie is the \"command head\" of her crew, co-ordinating them during missions by using her biologically implanted circuitry and software. \n\nDuring one of these missions, Sylvie collapses, regains consciousness, and Kovacs realizes that her personality seems to have been replaced by that of long-dead revolutionary leader Quellcrist Falconer. Harlan's World is surrounded by automated \"orbitals\" which target flying objects, such as vehicles, with high-energy beam weapons known as \"angelfire;\" Falconer is believed to have died without a backup of her cortical stack when her getaway aircraft was destroyed by angelfire 300 years prior.\n\nWhen Sylvie's crew returns from New Hok, they discover a younger version of Kovacs has been illegally duplicated into a different body (AKA \"double sleeved\") and is hunting them on behalf of the Harlan family that rules the planet. Most of Sylvie's crew is killed and Sylvie/Quellcrist is captured. Kovacs schemes to rescue Sylvie by approaching old criminal associates of his, the Little Blue Bugs.\n\nThe Little Blue Bugs mount a semi-successful attack on a Harlan fortress and rescue Sylvie/Quellcrist. Hiding from Harlan forces in a floating base, the neo-Quellists are sold out by its owner and recaptured. An assault by Kovacs and a single UN Envoy on the base ends badly when Kovacs is betrayed by the Envoy who was actually embedded with several colleagues. However, Sylvie/Quellcrist has established a connection with the orbitals and calls down angelfire, eliminating their captors. The younger Kovacs is killed in the aftermath.\n\nSylvie explains that angelfire is a destructive recording device. Thus, in destroying Quellcrist and the helicopter carrying her, it copied her. When the technology of the deCom crews advanced far enough, her persona was able to insert itself into Sylvie's implants and co-exist in her body.\n\nThe novel ends with Kovacs, Virginia Vidaura, and Sylvie/Quellcrist waiting to see if they can use Sylvie/Quellcrist's newfound connection to the orbitals and the expansion of a long-dormant genetic virus to turn the population against the ruling oligarchy.\n\n"}
{"id": "1832132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832132", "title": "Peter Venkman", "text": "Peter Venkman\n\nPeter Venkman, Ph.D., is a fictional character from the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. He appears in the films \"Ghostbusters\", \"Ghostbusters II\" and \"\" and in the animated television series \"The Real Ghostbusters\". In both live action films, he was portrayed by Bill Murray, and was voiced in the animated series first by Lorenzo Music and then by Dave Coulier. He is a parapsychologist and the leader of the Ghostbusters.\n\nIn 2008, Peter Venkman was selected by the magazine \"Empire\" as one of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\", described by \"Empire\"'s Nick de Semlyen as \"the ultimate New York hero: cynical, sarcastic, secretly sweet-natured\", \"a man possessed by manic spontaneity, with a wont to twirl in circles around a public concourse or declare undying love for a woman he's just met\", and the \"most popular\" character played by Murray.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Peter Venkman is one of three doctors of parapsychology on the Ghostbusters team. He holds Ph.D.s in both parapsychology and psychology. Originally his professional interests were focused on paranormal phenomena like ESP; he appeared not to believe in ghosts until he actually saw one. In the movies, he is characterized by his flippant persona, his approach to his profession as a scientific charlatan, and his womanizing demeanor. Fred Pfeil sees in him a postmodern hero, whose level of \"crass self-interest\" safeguards him from being ensnared by a stereotypical role.\n\nDespite Peter's lackadaisical attitude, from time to time he has created inventions that help the Ghostbusters save the day, and he is shrewd and more street-smart than either Ray Stantz or Egon Spengler. Peter serves as the front man for the group and possesses more social ability than the more academically inclined Ray and Egon. For instance, he is the one who is able to persuade the city mayor to release them after being arrested, return their equipment and otherwise support their attempt to stop Gozer.\n\nPeter Venkman was a professor working with Egon Spengler and Ray Stantz at Columbia University. The trio were researching the supernatural but, unlike his partners, Peter was not as enthusiastic about the topic. Despite having a passing interest in ESP, he appears not to have believed in ghosts until witnessing one personally. The team of three discovered the librarian ghost, but were unable to catch and show her off to the public. Subsequently, their funding was cut and they were fired from their university positions, though Peter seemed happy to look for new opportunities. After being fired, the three of them decided to build some advanced paranormal equipment and go into a career of freelance ghost catching.\n\nPeter encouraged and prodded Ray to mortgage his house in order to find the capital needed to purchase the firehouse. Whether motivated by the prospect of becoming rich or just the fact that he no longer had to work under the thumb of the board of regents, Dr. Venkman was very motivated to begin a new career. Peter soon became the first to meet the company's first client, Dana Barrett, and formed a romantic interest.\nDana had claimed that there were monsters in her fridge even though Peter could not find any such thing. After that incident, Peter, Egon, and Ray were eating dinner at the firehouse when their secretary Janine got a call. Peter and his team came to the Sedgewick Hotel, where Peter came face to face with the ghost that would one day become known as Slimer. Peter was slimed during his first encounter with the ghost, which Ray greatly praised as \"actual physical contact.\" Peter and his team eventually captured the ghost, which soon made them popular and busy around town with other ghosts.\n\nPeter had stopped by at one of her orchestra rehearsals. He happened upon her talking to a colleague who played in the orchestra with her that was interested her as well. He asked her, \"Who's the stiff?\" She answers, \"The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.\" Peter has found some answers for Dana, but say they can find out more on another night. Peter continues to compliment and flirt in confidence and Dana reluctantly says trying to keep down commotion, \"I'll see you Thursday.\" He says, \"We'll eat and read.\" As she walks away with her male colleague, he addresses her somewhat jealously, \"So, who the hell is that?!\" and Dana replies, \"A friend. An old friend.\" She counted smile because of Peter constant compliments towards her appearance which now he was stating in front of her male colleague.\n\nNot too long afterwards, Janine is overrun with calls and stressed out. She tells Peter there is a man waiting in his office from the EPA and she has been working two weeks without a break and states that he promised he would hire more help. He pretty much praises her experiences in order to let her know the door is open to discover more opportunities if she was unsatisfied with her present one working for him. As the phone is ringing once more, Peter replies to her, \"Are you going to Answer that?\". Peter soon met an EPA representative named Walter Peck, who got angry that Peter refused to show him the storage facility.\n\nAs Peter was coming to see Dana and take her out on a date, he noticed that she had undergone a radical change and was now acting very strangely. She barred entrance to her apartment, asking him if he was \"The Keymaster\". After getting the door slammed in his face he tricked her in order to gain entry. Once inside Dana referred to herself as Zuul, \"The Gatekeeper\" and told Peter she was awaiting the coming of Gozer, \"The Destructor\". Peter replied, \"Oh...\" and noticed slime seeping through the kitchen door and furniture. The possessed Dana quickly led Peter to the bedroom where she tried to seduce him asking him \"Do you want this body?\" which he rebuked asking if its a trick question. The possessed Dana was unrelenting in her seduction, telling Peter \"Take me now subcreature.\" Peter ignored her and Dana slammed him onto her bed, pouncing on him and pinning him to the bed with supernatural might. She passionately kissed him and rolled him over on top of her telling him \"I want you inside me\" alas Peter told her she must have two people inside of her already. Peter proceeded to try to talk to the real Dana Barrett, ignoring her seductive advances in the process. While asking for Dana she replied in an inhuman growling voice that \"There is no Dana, only Zuul\". Peter gave Zuul to the count of three to leave Dana's body to which she responded by turning her eyes white, thrashing her head back and forth on her bed then growling furiously like a beast at him and levitating above her bed. Peter, realizing the seriousness of Dana's condition, sedated her and called Egon to explain what was going on. He soon learned from Egon that her building was renovated by an evil architect named Ivo Shandor and she was being possessed by Zuul, the Gatekeeper of Gozer. After Peck returned and shut down the Containment Unit, the ghosts all escaped, Peter and the other Ghostbusters were imprisoned for EPA violations. Peter convinced the mayor that an apocalypse of \"Biblical proportions,\" was coming to destroy the city.\n\nThe Ghostbusters were released and toward Dana's building, escorted there by a police and army motorcade as a dark cloud started to cover the entire city. After an earthquake struck, nearly trapping them in rubble, the Ghostbusters made it to the top of the building. However they were too late to stop Dana and Louis Tully from releasing the evil Gozer and transforming into their possessors' Terror Dog forms. The Ghostbusters confronted Gozer, who electrocuted them before being zapped by their proton packs, vanishing and returning in the form of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (which Ray had been thinking of). Peter and his team then crossed their streams and forced the door to Gozer's dimension to close, destroying the Marshmallow Man in a blaze of flames and saving the city. Peter rescued Dana, no longer possessed, from the rubble of Zuul's charred body, finally winning her affections for saving her.\n\nDespite saving the town from Gozer, the Ghostbusters were put out of business due to being sued for all the damage that was done during the battle. Also, Peter and Dana's relationship faltered due to his fear of commitment and taking her for granted. She left for her male colleague in the orchestra, married him and had a child. He unexpectedly \"ditched\" her for an opportunity leaving her and his son behind.\n\nIn the years since, Egon described Peter (even to Dana) as being borderline(manic) until he eventually, \"crossed the border.\" Peter became the host of a psychic reality talk show in the years after the Gozer battle. He and his teammates went to Dana's aid after she claimed her baby stroller rolled away from her by itself, and pinpointed there was \"something brewing under the street,\" of First Avenue. Egon, Peter, and Ray start to dig under the surface of the road where Ray is lowered down into the hole where he discovers a River of Slime. The three Ghostbusters were summoned to court, where they stand trial on the grounds of violating a restraining order and destroying a section of First Avenue. They got back into business after the slime sample in the courtroom absorbed the judge's negative energy while shouting and exploded out two ghosts named the Scoleri Brothers. After the judge rescinded the order and dismissed the case(while under duress from the ghosts), the Ghostbusters were allowed to put on their equipment and bust the ghosts, declaring to the public afterwards that they were open for business once again. While his teammates investigate the river of slime underneath the city, Peter renewed his relationship with Dana, whose baby Oscar was being targeted by the ghost of Vigo the Carpathian. Peter and his team in the end defeated Vigo and saved the city once again.\n\nEven when paralyzed, Peter's tongue was still as sharp as ever and he still managed to provoke Vigo's ire with a variety of pointed insults, including referring to him as a \"dumb blonde\".\n\nMurray is confirmed by Aykroyd that he will reprise his role as Venkman in \"\" (2021).\n\nIn \"The Real Ghostbusters\" series, Peter's womanizing is toned down somewhat (though he is still quick to approach attractive women), but he retains his quick wit and cynical demeanor, and his arrogance is played up more. While not the official leader of the group, Venkman is the closest thing they have to one, and often makes the decision whether the Ghostbusters will take a case or not. He often reinforces the prospect of Ghostbusters being a business and, with rare exceptions, opposes ghostbusting without the promise of equity. He is originally opposed to the idea of Slimer living in the firehouse, but quickly develops a love–hate relationship with the ghost; mostly hate whenever he is \"slimed\" on an episodic basis.\n\nThe episodes \"Venkman's Ghost Repellers\", \"Cold Cash and Hot Water\", and \"Treasure of the Sierra Tamale\" feature Peter's father, a con artist/businessman who could not make an honest dollar and was often away on business during Peter's childhood, as mentioned in \"X-mas Marks The Spot\". He is depicted as a selfish, even obnoxious father; his relationship with Peter is estranged. Peter has claimed to be a Scorpio, as mentioned in \"Mean Green Teen Machine\". In \"Last Train to Oblivion\", one of Peter's favorite hobbies is trains, and he used to dream about driving a big locomotive when he was a child (Peter even studied engineering in college for two years before discovering it had nothing to do with trains). Peter Venkman was voiced by Lorenzo Music during the first season. At the start of the second season, Music was replaced by Dave Coulier when Murray complained to the studio that the character sounded too much like Garfield the cat (who was also voiced by Music). Coincidentally, Murray voiced Garfield in the 2004 live-action film and its .\n\nPeter only appears in the two-part series finale. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters, Peter went to Hollywood and tried to sell an idea for a Ghostbusters movie, but never got it going because he was waiting for Brad Pitt to become available to portray him.\n\nThe Ghostbusters in \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" keep a statue of Peter Venkman, complete with uniform and working original Proton Pack, in the Ghostbusters Firehouse.\n\nPeter was featured as a playable character in \"Ghostbusters II\" for NES.\n\nPeter was featured as a playable character in \"New Ghostbusters 2\" for NES and Game Boy.\n\nVenkman shows some initial distrust when Ray and Egon hire the Rookie, jealous that he gets issued new equipment and gets a 'title'. However, upon Egon and Ray explaining to Peter that the equipment the Rookie is issued is \"highly experimental and, if not handled properly, could blow the user clear into New Jersey,\" Peter immediately lost interest in both the Rookie and his gear. Peter eventually warms up to the Rookie and occasionally praises his developing skills, but his interest is soon lost once they encountered Ilyssa Selwyn who, true to himself, he took an instant liking to. Peter flirted with her, but she was disinterested. At the end, he won her heart and shared a brief kiss with Ilyssa before she was slimed by Slimer.\n\nPeter still maintains the smooth-talking slacker identity from the previous two movies, willing to jump at any chance to get out of doing work or going into a dangerous situation. He offers to take Marine Ecto-8 to avoid going onto Shandor Island. These attempts are transparent at best, prompting the other Ghostbusters to roll their eyes or glare at him.\n\nPeter is still primarily motivated in his own best interests. He can be goaded into expending effort if an attractive female or a lucrative payoff is involved. But in the end he will still come around to doing the right thing when it's really important.\n\nVenkman appears in Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\" game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013.\n\nVenkman appears as a playable character in \"Lego Dimensions\", with archival audio of Bill Murray being used to represent his character. Out of the four, Venkman is the default Ghostbuster that is selected.\n\nBruce G. Hallenbeck, author of \"Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008\", compares Peter Venkman to Groucho Marx, who hosted the 1950s quiz show \"You Bet Your Life\". Hallenback said, \"With a quip for every situation, a put-down for everyone who deserves it and an ability to rise above it all, Venkman is a lot like Groucho.\" The comparison is also reinforced by the scene in the original movie where, waiting for Dana Barrett to finish the day's rehearsals with the orchestra Peter jogs up and down a bustling New York square hopping on a single foot, alternately, just as Groucho Marx used to do.\n"}

He was portrayed by Dan Aykroyd in all four live action films, and voiced by Frank Welker in the animated series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of parapsychology, along with Dr. Peter Venkman and Dr. Egon Spengler.\n\nRay is an expert on paranormal history and metallurgy. He is characterized by his almost childlike enthusiasm towards his work, and his forthright acceptance of paranormal activity. As a result, Peter once during the movie referred to him as \"the heart of the Ghostbusters\". Ray has extensive knowledge of the Bible (to the point of even quoting a specific book and chapter – \"I remember Revelation 7:12\"—about the end of the world, though the passage he quotes is actually Revelation 6:12), but is an agnostic, commenting when asked if he believes in God, \"Never met Him\". As revealed in \"\", Ray attended a seminary at some stage in his life. He is known for his wordy and overly technical explanations of scientific and paranormal phenomena. Ray, along with Egon, is responsible for pioneering the Ghostbusters' theories and designing and building the equipment used for catching and containing ghosts.\n\nBefore being kicked out of the University, Ray was devoting a lot of his workday to interviewing people who had some sort of encounter with the paranormal. After the entanglement with the library ghost, Ray was more motivated to continue on with that type of work. When the guys were let go by Dean Yager, he was initially crushed, primarily concerned with his academic integrity, financial stability, etc. Ray had briefly worked in the private sector beforehand, and knew it was not conducive to his line of work, as they expected results.\n\nAfter talking with Peter Venkman and Egon Spengler, they all decided to try hunting ghosts full-time. Ray even mortgaged the house he was born in to provide the starting capital to get the company started and lease the firehouse. In addition, he rummaged through used car lots to find a suitable vehicle and repair it to make the Ecto-1.\n\nDr. Stantz also has the distinction of being the first Ghostbuster to meet Slimer. Unlike his other continuity, however, Ray dropped his cigarette in fear. He then went proton blasting, after his call for assistance was unheard by Venkman.\n\nRay accidentally chose the form of Gozer's appearance because of his childhood memories at Camp Waconda. Despite his initial attempt at negotiations, he wound up fighting Gozer with his Proton Pack. After reversing the particle flow to force Gozer back into his realm, Ray was concerned about the other guys' welfare after the explosion, and then celebrated with them all afterward. Although this was short-lived by the, \"ungrateful, yuppie larvae!\" representing the city, county and state of New York.\n\nIn the second film, following the decline of the Ghostbusters' business, he and Winston were entertainers for parties. When he was not doing that, he was running his bookstore, Ray's Occult Books. However, when Dana Barrett comes to Egon and later Ray, it becomes clear that something supernatural was once again happening underneath New York City.\n\nRay and Egon experiment with the Psychomagnotheric Slime they find and eventually discover a way to not only positively charge the slime, but utilize it to animate the Statue of Liberty in their final assault on Vigo the Carpathian. Ray also briefly becomes the host for Vigo himself, but a liberal dousing of the positively charged mood slime quickly cures him of that.\n\nDan Aykroyd has a cameo appearance as Stantz in \"Casper\". When Carrigan and Dibs are attempting to evict the Ghostly Trio from the McFadden Manor, before contacting Dr. James Harvey, they contact Ray Stantz of the Ghostbusters. After he fails to capture the Ghostly Trio, he runs out of the manor in fear, and says to Carrigan and Dibs: \"Who you gonna call? Someone else.\"\n\nAykroyd confirmed that he will reprise his role as Stantz in \"\" (2020).\n\nRay has an extended family (which has different nationalities ranging from Swiss to Scottish to Russian), including his Aunt Lois (who appears in the episode, \"The Spirit of Aunt Lois\"), and Uncle Andrew MacMillan of Dunkeld, Scotland (who is mentioned as being deceased in \"Bustman's Holiday\").\n\nRay was born in the Bronx in 1959, according to the episodes \"Citizen Ghost\", and \"It's About Time\", then later moved to Morrisville, which appears in \"Look Homeward Ray\". The latter episode also reveals that Ray's childhood crush was a brunette named Elaine.\n\nDuring the show's run he was the closest member of the team to being a pilot, having won a free flying lesson in 1976, as mentioned in \"You Can't Take It With You\".\n\nRay's surname was misspelled in the series as \"Stanz\", in much the same way as Winston Zeddemore's surname was misspelled \"Zeddmore\".\n\nRay is the only Ghostbuster to wear the original beige jumpsuit uniform in both the animated series and the films, while the other Ghostbusters wore color coded jumpsuits in the animated series – brown for Venkman, light blue for Winston and gray-blue for Egon (presumably to help differentiate them better).\n\nRay appears only in the two-part series finale of \"Extreme Ghostbusters\". After the closing down of the Ghostbusters Ray got a job at a major university. After a \"minor mishap,\" followed by a large explosion, he has a job at Perpetual Motors, a used car company.\n\nA likeness of Aykroyd, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the \"\", that was released on June 16, 2009. Aykroyd also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, Stantz is eager to expand his knowledge in regards to researching the paranormal. More than once he asks the Rookie to collect samples and take readings for later research. Ray is also the most vocally supportive of the Rookie.\n\nIt is mentioned that the mortgage for the Ghostbusters Headquarters is in his name. His selection for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man's form of Gozer's \"Destructor Form\" was mentioned in a quote \"It wasn't me this time, I swear it!\" when the Ghostbusters see that the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is once again terrorizing New York. Ray is the most visibly shaken to see the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man again.\n\nRay is shown to possess skill in operating nautical vessels (i.e.: migrant sponge observation, mentioned earlier) as he's the primary navigator on Marine Ecto-8.\n\nStantz appears in Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\" game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013.\n\nStantz appears in \"Lego Dimensions\", with archival audio of Dan Aykroyd being used to represent his character.\n"}
{"id": "1832144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832144", "title": "Egon Spengler", "text": "Egon Spengler\n\nEgon Spengler, PhD is a fictional character from the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. He appears in the films \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II\", in the animated television series \"The Real Ghostbusters\" and \"Extreme Ghostbusters\", in the video games \"\" and Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\". Spengler was portrayed by Harold Ramis in the films and voiced by him in \"\" and \"Lego Dimensions\", and voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the cartoon series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of parapsychology, along with Dr. Peter Venkman and Dr. Ray Stantz.\n\nThe character of Egon Spengler was named after Oswald Spengler and a classmate of Ramis at Senn High School, Egon Donsbach, a Hungarian refugee.\n\nChristopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Goldblum were all considered for the role of Egon Spengler, before Ramis, who had gotten close to the character while writing him, felt compelled to play it himself.\n\nLaMarche stated that when he auditioned for the part of Spengler in \"The Real Ghostbusters\", he was asked not to do an impression of Ramis, which he ignored because impressions were one of his strengths as a performer, and there was no other way he could imagine properly portraying the character other than to follow Ramis's example. He got the part anyway and said in an interview that he did two different takes: in which he impersonated Ramis, the other in which he tried a more \"Woody Allen\"-like approach that did not suit the character's physicality, he admitted.\n\nEgon Spengler is a tall, laconic, bespectacled, awkward member of the team responsible for the main theoretical framework for their paranormal/quantum studies. Being addicted to science, he is the creator of the Ghostbusters' equipment along with Raymond Stantz, thus making him the brains of the Ghostbusters. Although book smart, Spengler does not have much social ability, as demonstrated by his stiff interactions with the Ghostbusters' secretary Janine Melnitz, and his reliance on Peter Venkman as spokesperson for the group.\n\nSpengler is the most serious and rigid member of the team. Of his hobbies, Spengler states that he collects \"spores, molds, and fungus\", and claims that, as a child, the only toy he ever had was \"part of a Slinky\", which he straightened out. As implied in the first movie, Spengler apparently is a sugar junkie, due to his affection for sweets and candy. According to the 2009 video game, Spengler sleeps an average of 14 minutes per day, leaving him \"a lot of time to work.\"\n\nEgon was very interested in paranormal phenomena, even while working with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in theories of reincarnation.\n\nEgon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their mantra, \"we're ready to believe you.\" Examples were Dana Barrett from her Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar. Even people Peter called \"schizo\" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were. For his part, Venkman once took back everything negative he said about him, rewarding the fellow scientist with his favorite candy bar (a Crunch bar). Egon's only weakness is evidently sugar (or at least snacks), as he is seen, on occasion, snacking.\n\nEgon developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack, the Trap, and the storage facility. He was also aware of the risk of crossing the streams. He spent a lot of time focusing on the stability of the storage facility, and was concerned about the possibilities of a P.K.E. surge of dangerous proportions. Egon was particularly critical of Walter Peck's actions, and his attitude that the Ghostbusters were responsible for the explosion of the containment unit that occurred when Peck ordered a municipal worker to shut the unit down. After their encounter with Stay Puft, Egon suggested an atypical solution when he recommended blasting Gozer's dimensional portal while crossing the proton streams to reverse the particle flow and send Gozer back to his/its dimension.\n\nEgon once tried to drill a hole in his own head (a process known as trepanning), which he says \"would have worked\" if Venkman had not stopped him.\n\nDue to the large amount of collateral damage the city of New York suffered from the battle with Gozer, the Ghostbusters were sued by nearly every county and city agency in New York. Additionally a judicial restraining order was enacted which barred the Ghostbusters from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators, effectively putting them out of business. Five years after the events of the first film Egon was working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research and was conducting experiments on human emotions. A negative test involved keeping a couple with marriage problems locked in a room for hours and gradually raising the temperature. A positive test involved a girl in a room with dozens of stuffed animals and a puppy.\n\nHe was the first person Dana Barrett contacted when her baby carriage took off by itself. Egon recommended bringing in Ray, and they both performed a physical exam on Dana's son Oscar. Egon, along with Peter and Ray were later arrested after digging a large hole under First Avenue as part of their paranormal investigations to help Dana.\n\nDuring the course of their trial they were found guilty of willful destruction of public property, fraud, violating their judicial restraining order, and malicious mischief by judge Stephen Wexler (whom Egon said was known as \"The Hammer\"). While angrily insulting the trio judge Wexler inadvertently released the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers; two murderers he sentenced to death by the electric chair. During the chaos judge Wexler dismisses the charges against the Ghostbusters, and rescinds the judicial restraining order allowing Egon, Ray, and Peter to capture the ghosts, effectively putting the Ghostbusters back in business. Egon had a dry sense of humor, of which he used on Peter to bewilder him, and smirked at his friend's cluelessness on what the word \"epididymis\" was.\n\nEgon primarily worked with Ray, both of whom were still living at the Firehouse, conducting research on the pink slime. Still very scientifically minded, Egon seems to have loosened up a little bit, letting his sense of humor show and even giving Dana a smile and Peter (who was carried away with photographing Vigo's portrait), a knowing smile.\n\nAlthough the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" film is a reboot, the film's marketing confirms that a version of Egon Spengler does exist in the film's fictional universe. According to a tie-in video to the film, Kate McKinnon's character Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and Harold Ramis' character Dr. Egon Spengler created the film's proton packs. The paragraph accompanying the video read:\n\n\"Engineers at Sony Corporation developed the 2016 Proton Pack™ in collaboration with nuclear engineer and munitions expert Dr. Jillian Holtzmann. Sony President and CEO Kazuo Hirai commented “The perfection of the Proton Pack™, long a dream of the world’s greatest engineers since first pioneered by\" Dr. Egon Spengler \"of Columbia University, is an example of Sony’s relentless pursuit of innovation. It absolutely delivers the wow factor that is so important to our company mission.\"\nAdditionally, in the film, a bronze bust of Harold Ramis as the film's version of Spengler is seen just as Erin Gilbert leaves her office. During the credits of \"Ghostbusters\", the words \"For Harold Ramis\" are seen.\n\nIn the 2020 film, which serves as a direct sequel to the original \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II\", Egon has since passed away and left a house and land, containing Ghostbusters gear, to his daughter Callie and his two grandchildren Phoebe and Trevor. \nAfter the near destruction of New York in 1989, cases of paranormal activity ceased and the Ghostbusters shut up shop. Egon spent years investigating Ivo Shandor and bought a ranch near to the mine that the architect used to build Spook Central. Egon discovered that the portal to the Gozer Dimension was only closed and not destroyed, and the Selenium mineral was still supercharged in the earth from the events of 1984.\nBefore he died he left instruction for his family hidden at his ranch. The kids in the film seek the help of their teacher Mr Gooberson who was a young recruit of the original Ghostbusters team in the early 1990s before it closed. He tracks down the old team.\n\nSpengler's hair was changed from brown in the films (Ramis's natural hair color) to a blond pompadour in the animated series (Spengler wore his hair in a ponytail on \"Extreme Ghostbusters\"). This was reportedly done due to legal issues concerning character / actor likenesses.\n\nDespite his leanings toward science, Spengler has a family history of witchcraft (three ancestors, Zedekiah, Eli and Ezekiel, were wizards), of which he is not so much ashamed as \"strongly\" considers irrelevant, mainly because he sees science as relevant. Spengler's faith in science was also tested in one episode where the Ghostbusters get abducted to the ghost world by the ghost of Al Capone. Spengler's scientific equipment fails until he is told by former capos of Capone (who aid the Ghostbusters in revenge for Capone double-crossing them) that only magic can harm ghosts in the ghost world as opposed to science harming ghosts in the human world, thus forcing Spengler to accept the wizardry methods of his ancestors to defeat Capone.\n\nHe is the love interest of Janine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters' secretary, in the first film and both animated series (\"Ghostbusters II\" excluded their romance due to Ramis' dislike of the subplot, thus having Melnitz date Louis Tully instead). Spengler sometimes appears to be unaware of Melnitz's romantic interest in him, but at times he displays having similar feelings for her, such as when he gave her a geranium as a gift when she expressed an interest in plants (which backfired horribly when it was revealed that the geranium was possessed by a ghost and nearly destroyed her apartment, along with much of Brooklyn; though Spengler managed to thwart the ghost, Melnitz angrily told Spengler he would have to pay for the damages to her home) and when he rushed to her rescue in \"Janine, You've Changed\"; he also embraces her in \"Ghost Busted\" after she was kidnapped and held for ransom by a gangster, and became jealous when she was briefly involved with a slimy businessman named Paul Smart.\n\nIn the episode \"Cry Uncle\", Spengler's well-meaning but skeptical uncle Cyrus, visits him and, since he does not believe that Spengler's work with the Ghostbusters is real scientific work and therefore a waste of Spengler's genius, tries to make him come back to Ohio (where Spengler grew up) to work at his uncle's lab, but fortunately, after his uncle accidentally releases the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from the containment unit, he realizes that ghosts are real and accepts Spengler's work.\n\nThroughout the series, Spengler would have his soul switched with that of a demon, have his molecular structure destabilized to the point that it stranded him in the Netherworld (requiring him to be rescued by the others), regress into a baby, turn into a were-chicken, and have his intellect switched with Slimer's. He has however, ceased his sugar junkie ways, only to briefly be tempted by a candy store when in Slimer's body (a likely fact that Slimer was an overt glutton).\n\nIt is revealed in \"The Boogieman Cometh\" that, as a child, Spengler was stalked by the boogieman, a supernatural monster that fed on the fear of children and hid in their closets, and was particularly fond of Spengler's fear; it was these encounters with the creature that inspired Spengler to study the paranormal, and as an adult, he would battle the Boogieman twice and defeat him.\n\nIt is implied in one episode of the animated series that Spengler accidentally burned down his family's garage.\n\nSpengler is the only original Ghostbuster to return for the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" series as a regular, acting as a mentor to the new Ghostbusters (the others appeared for a two-part episode, \"Back in the Saddle\"), and monitoring and sustaining the Containment Unit while working as a paranormal studies professor at a university. He is the de facto leader of the new, younger team of Ghostbusters; although the old team had gone into retirement after they apparently dealt with all the ghosts in the city, after the digging of a new subway tunnel resulted in the release of an ancient ghost, Spengler was forced to recruit his only four current students to act as the new Ghostbusters.\n\nAlthough willing to do his share of the legwork, Spengler overestimates his abilities and his aging becomes apparent when he is no longer able to work at the same level as in his younger days, generally working at the firehouse doing research while the team handle the actual 'Ghostbusting', though when the situation calls for it he will help. Melnitz is still carrying a torch for him, which leaves him a little flustered. He celebrates his 40th birthday during this series, which would put him in his late twenties when \"The Real Ghostbusters\" began. Age is the largest factor causing Spengler to having transition from active ghost hunting to a mentorship role; in one episode where the original Ghostbusters guest starred on an episode the audience clearly sees middle adulthood has affected the speed and weakened the stamina of the original Ghostbusters.\n\nAlthough Egon Spengler does not appear in the 1990 \"The Earth Day Special\", his character and status as a Ghostbuster is mentioned, and Harold Ramis portrays his twin brother, named Elon Spengler, who is the President of the Wastebusters.\n\nA likeness of Ramis, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the \"\" that was released on June 16, 2009. Ramis also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, Egon becomes significantly more 'hands-on' during the course of the video game. He and Ray instruct the Rookie in the use of the Proton Pack and its eventual PCS upgrades. Over the course of the game, it becomes evident that he was somewhat traumatized by their exhausting trek up the stairs of 55 Central Park West. While in the alternate dimension of the library, Egon is heard to groan, \"Oh no,\" and when Ray asks if he saw something scary, Egon replies, \"Stairs, lots of stairs\". Before the \"Return to Sedgewick Hotel\" mission, Stantz comments that Spengler was once a coroner, to which he replied that he maintains interest in the subject as a hobby.\n\nSpengler appears in Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\" game for iOS alongside his niece, Michelle Ying. The game was released on January 24, 2013.\n\nSpengler appears in \"Lego Dimensions\", with archival audio of Harold Ramis being used to represent his character.\n\n"}
{"id": "1832151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832151", "title": "Book of Thomas the Contender", "text": "Book of Thomas the Contender\n\nThe Book of Thomas the Contender, also known more simply as the Book of Thomas (not to be confused with the Gospel of Thomas), is one of the books of the New Testament apocrypha represented in the Nag Hammadi library (CG II), a cache of Gnostic gospels secreted in the Egyptian desert. The title derives from the first line of text.\n\nThe colophon appended to the text gives the title \"The Contender writing to the Perfect\".\n\nThere are two competing theories as to the composition of the text:\n\nAn additional consideration is that, since the scribe writing the text is named as Matthias, this work may actually be the lost Gospel of Matthias. The dialogue can also be read as an internal conversation between Jesus and his lower self, Judas Thomas, the twin (contender for supremacy of the soul). The New Testament's \"doubting\" Thomas and Judas \"the betrayer\" could also be symbolic and descriptive of this internal battle between the Christ Self and ego identity.\n\nThe content of this work is quite hyperbolic and gnostic in style, in the sense of imparting a private, arcane knowledge related to good versus evil, and while it lacks references to the elaborate gnostic cosmology, its gnostic allusions to the pleroma and light versus fire clearly point to its origins. \n\nThen the savior continued and said, \"O unsearchable love of the light! O bitterness of the fire that blazes in the bodies of men and in their marrow, kindling in them night and day, and burning the limbs of men and making their minds become drunk and their souls become deranged... Woe to you, captives, for you are bound in caverns! You laugh! In mad laughter you rejoice! You neither realize your perdition, nor do you reflect on your circumstances, nor have you understood that you dwell in darkness and death! On the contrary, you are drunk with the fire and full of bitterness. Your mind is deranged on account of the burning that is in you, and sweet to you are the poison and the blows of your enemies! And the darkness rose for you like the light, for you surrendered your freedom for servitude! You darkened your hearts and surrendered your thoughts to folly, and you filled your thoughts with the smoke of the fire that is in you! (Book of Thomas the Contender)\n\nThe gnostic content in the texts of the Nag Hammadi trove can be argued to be often identical to Jesus' conceptual content, but the metaphorical language and symbolism are strikingly different. \"The Book of Thomas the Contender\" and its guidance in overcoming ego \"lusts/attachments\" differs markedly with Jesus' gentler, more practical psychological approach in the four canonical Gospels and the Gospel of Thomas.\n\n"}

He played with the Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nStallard is most remembered for having given up New York Yankees slugger Roger Maris' 61st home run in 1961.\n\nStallard began his professional career in Minor League Baseball with the Lafayette Red Sox of the Class D Midwest League from 1956 to 1957. Over the two seasons, he notched up win-loss records of 5–8 and 7–12, respectively. For the 1958 season, he was promoted to the Raleigh Capitals of the Class B Carolina League, where he posted a 9–6 record and a 3.09 earned run average. 1959 had several stops for Stallard, the first being the Class AAA Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Stallard threw for a 7–11 record and a 3.51 ERA. He also saw time with the Class A Eastern League Allentown Red Sox, where he posted up a 9–4 record with a dominant 1.68 ERA. During the 1960 season, where Stallard was eventually called up to the major leagues, he posted a 4–5 record with a 4.82 ERA for Allentown.\n\nStallard appeared in four games in his debut season of 1960. He faced 15 batters without giving up a single hit, and amassed 6 strikeouts. Three of his appearances were against the New York Yankees.\n\n1961 marked Stallard's first full season in Major League Baseball, starting in 14 games and playing in a relief role for 29.Right-handed batters only hit .209 off Stallard for the season. He also had a strong month of May, tallying a 2.70 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 10 innings of relief. On July 16, Stallard was given his first Major League start. In 6 innings pitched, Stallard gave up one earned run on six hits, but he would get a no decision as Boston reliever Arnold Earley blew a 1–0 lead which eventually led to a 4–3 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Stallard's first victory came on August 10, striking out eight in 8 innings pitched in a 3–2 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Stallard started in 14 of his last 15 appearances for the season going 2–7 with a 5.00 ERA and 69 strikeouts in 86 innings pitched as a starter.\n\nOn October 1, 1961, New York Yankees outfielder Roger Maris hit his 61st home run of the season off of Stallard, breaking Babe Ruth's single season record of 60.\n\nThe contest between the Red Sox and the Yankees was the final game of the season. Stallard, then 2–6, faced off against Yankees right-hander Bill Stafford (12–9). In the first duel between Maris and Stallard in the first inning, Stallard threw a changeup to Maris that ended up being a soft fly to left field. In the fourth inning, Stallard fell behind 2–0 to Maris. Up to that point, Stallard had said that he was probably having the best game he had ever pitched. Stallard threw a fastball, and Maris hit it over the wall for his 61st home run. It was Maris's only hit off Stallard in seven lifetime at bats.\n\nStallard felt no shame over the ordeal, saying, \"I'm glad he did it off me. Otherwise, I would never have been thought of again. That was about all I did, and I've had a good time with it.\" There has been speculation that Stallard grooved the pitch in an attempt to help Maris hit the home run, claims which he denied. Stallard struck out five and gave up five hits and just the one earned run in seven innings on the outing, but the Red Sox failed to score in a 1–0 loss, dropping him to a final record of 2–7 for the season.\n\nStallard appeared in only one game for the Red Sox in 1962, spending the rest of the season with the minor league Class AAA Seattle Rainiers, where he threw for a 7–6 record and a 3.49 ERA.\n\nStallard resumed full-time major league pitching duty with the young New York Mets in 1963. Boston had shipped him along with Pumpsie Green and Al Moran to the Mets for Felix Mantilla on December 11, 1962.\n\nStallard again started in the relief role for his first 13 games, but was finally given the opportunity to start on June 2. The game against the Pittsburgh Pirates was his first start since the day Roger Maris hit his 61st home run of the season. Stallard responded to the promotion by notching up a 2.28 ERA with 27 strikeouts in innings for the entire month of June. Afterwards, though, Stallard's season fell apart. He ended with a record of 6–17 to go with a 4.71 ERA.\n\nDespite improving his ERA in 1964 to 3.79, Stallard still led the MLB with 20 losses to accompany only 10 wins. Even with his abysmal record, Stallard was still tied for 2nd with Jack Fisher for the highest number of wins for the Mets, only one behind Al Jackson (11–16). Stallard also gained the unfortunate distinction, albeit less well-known, as the starting pitcher who lost in Jim Bunning's perfect game on June 21, giving up six earned runs in innings. In 11 of his games the Mets scored one or no runs. While with the Mets, Stallard developed something of a taste for New York's night life, dating, among others, actress Julie Newmar, who would go on to play Catwoman in the \"Batman\" television series.\n\nOn December 7, 1964, Stallard joined the St. Louis Cardinals in a move that sent him to the Cards in exchange for Johnny Lewis and Gordie Richardson.\n\nStallard had the best season of his career in his first year with the Cardinals in 1965. After pitching in his first three games as a reliever, Stallard was moved to starter on April 24, and began the season 7–3 with a 2.80 ERA. In May alone, Stallard went 3–0 with a 2.31 ERA in 50 innings.\n\nThough going only 3–2 from September 1 to the end of the season, Stallard still threw for a 2.41 ERA in 33 innings over the period. He finished the season 11–8 with a 3.38 ERA. Among Cardinals starters, his win total and ERA were second to future Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, who had 20 wins and a 3.07 ERA.\n\nDuring the 1966 season, Stallard was very vocal about his displeasure of being assigned to the bullpen, though he had a 6.10 ERA at the time and had just came off three consecutive games where he gave up one or more earned runs in relief. He was promoted back to the starting role on June 4, but it only amounted to a 5.71 ERA in seven starts, averaging only five innings per outing.\n\nHis final start on July 19 against the Atlanta Braves was disastrous, giving up five earned runs in just 3 innings pitched. The Cardinals fought back to prevail 10–9 in 12 innings, but the damage had been done. Stallard played his final Major League game on July 24 against the Chicago Cubs on the front-end of a doubleheader. He came in to pitch in the bottom of the 6th, and gave up a home run to the first batter he faced, Ron Santo. Stallard pitched into the 7th. After giving up another run, reliever Joe Hoerner replaced him on the mound.\n\nSoon after his final appearance, the Cardinals reassigned Stallard to the Class AAA Tulsa Oilers of the Pacific Coast League. From 1967 to 1973, he played for several more minor league teams including the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs and High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms, with stops in Torreón and Córdoba of the Class AAA Mexican League.\n\nStallard took a season off from pitching in 1968, serving as a pitching coach for the Hi-Toms under manager Jack McKeon, previously a Minnesota Twins scout and eventual manager of the 2003 World Series champion Florida Marlins and two-time National League Manager of the Year Award winner. Stallard resumed his playing career in 1969 for High Point-Thomasville by posting a 3–4 record and a 2.68 ERA.\n\nDespite posting solid earned run averages in three of his final four seasons (2.68, 2.52, 2.35), Stallard never received a call to the Majors again. In his final season, 1973, Stallard posted a 5–11 record with a 2.35 ERA at Córdoba.\n\nOver the course of his major league career, some Hall of Fame players had a tough time solving Stallard. Willie Mays was a career .200 hitter off him (6-for-30), Willie McCovey stuttered in at .152 (5-for-33, but with 3 home runs), Roberto Clemente hit .138 (4-for-29), and Frank Robinson could only muster a .214 (6-for-28) success rate against the pitcher. Others legends, however, such as Lou Brock (9-for-16) had no problem rattling Stallard.\n\nStallard died on December 6, 2017, at the age of 80.\n\n"}

He was killed in the celebrated Hamilton–Mohun Duel in Hyde Park.\n\nMohun was the second child of Charles, 3rd Baron Mohun and his wife Philippa, daughter of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey. His father died shortly after his birth, following a duel, and left him the family estate. The estate, however, was heavily in debt. Due to this Mohun received no education, and was forced to resort to gambling in order to support his lavish lifestyle.\n\nMohun married Charlotte Orby, granddaughter of Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield, in 1691 with the hope that this match would alleviate some of his debt. Unfortunately he received no dowry for the marriage, and the couple separated shortly thereafter. Following the separation, Mohun's behaviour became ever more licentious. A gambling dispute in late 1692 resulted in his first duel, with John Kennedy, 7th Earl of Cassilis. But Mohun is best remembered for the events of 9 December of that year—a friend of Mohun's, an officer named Richard Hill, had fallen in love with the actress Anne Bracegirdle; however he thought himself, almost certainly erroneously, to face competition from actor William Mountfort. Mohun and Hill ambushed the actor after a performance and, whilst Mohun restrained him—or by some eyewitness accounts stood by watching—Hill stabbed him through the chest. Following Mountfort's death the next day, Hill fled the country. Captured, Mohun stood trial before the House of Lords. However, in a verdict that was widely condemned, Mohun was acquitted on 6 February 1693.\n\nMohun joined the army shortly after his acquittal. There he served under Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, the uncle of his former wife, and briefly served in France. In 1697 the Lords again tried Mohun for the murder of Richard Coote following a duel on Leicester Square. Mohun was again acquitted, although his friend Edward Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick was found guilty of manslaughter. \n\nAfter this incident Mohun took his seat in the House of Lords. In 1701 he accompanied the Earl of Macclesfield on a diplomatic mission to Hanover. Following the death of Macclesfield later in the year, Mohun was left most of his estate. He spent over a decade defending his inheritance from rival claimants, most famously from James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton. In 1707 he became a member of the Kit-Cat Club, the pre-eminent Whig political and literary association of the period. Also in 1707 Mohun began building his new country house, Gawsworth New Hall.\n\nIn 1712, two years after Mohun's Whig party had been heavily defeated in an election, the Duke of Hamilton gained the post of special envoy to Paris. Also at this time Mohun's legal dispute with Hamilton over his inheritance of the Macclesfield estate was going badly. Shortly before Hamilton's scheduled departure for France, Mohun challenged him to a duel which was fought on 15 November in Hyde Park. Many of Hamilton's supporters believed (on the report of Hamilton's second) that the Duke had been killed after slaying Mohun by Mohun's second, General George MacCartney. The only satisfactory evidence was that the principals had mortally wounded each other, both dying at the scene. Macartney fled and was charged, but acquitted by his peers on his return from France, and the conclusion was that Mohun had wounded Hamilton mortally before dying.\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray fictionalised Mohun's duels in his novel \"The History of Henry Esmond\". \n\nMohun and Hamilton suffered such horrific injuries that the government passed legislation banning the use of seconds in such duels.\nAlso as a result swords were replaced as the weapons of choice in duel by the pistol, which tended to result in shorter and less bloody fights.\n\n"}

The museum houses rotating exhibits on the second floor. Also on the second floor is the HubCap Cafe, \nand a vehicle art gallery featuring artists such as Bill Bravo.\n\nThe museum's collection features over 75 bicycles, motorcycles, automobiles and trucks in exhibits telling the story of people and products on the move from the days of the carriage to the vehicles of tomorrow.\n\nThe museum also houses the archives of Mack Trucks.\n\nAs early as 1989, Allentown city officials had announced plans to revitalize an old industrial area, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian meat packing plant, along the Lehigh River. This redevelopment, which was to be known as \"Lehigh Landing,\" was to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals. Development was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending. After three separate groundbreakings (2001, 2004 and 2005), the museum, which cost over $17 million to build, was officially opened to the public on April 12, 2008.\n\nA historically important part of the museum's collection is the 1889 Nadig Gas-Powered Carriage, one of the first gas-powered vehicles driven in America. Henry Nadig, a German-born mechanic living in Allentown, built his gas-powered carriage in 1889, two years before Charles E. Duryea's first gas-powered automobile. Police forced him to drive the carriage at night, because during the day it scared horses. The vehicle was discovered rusting in a collapsed shed in Allentown, and restored.\n\nThe collection of the America on Wheels is minimal as the majority of the vehicles on display are on loan. The West Gallery changes every six months based on a new theme. A number of the vehicles are on loan from the Mack Truck Museum of Allentown PA.\n\n\n"}

The album was released on April 5, 2005, and it debuted at No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart, knocking out Mariah Carey's \"The Emancipation of Mimi\". This marked the first time that a male artist from a rock or pop group has debuted at number one with his first solo album since \"Billboard\" introduced the chart 50 years ago.\n\nThe album spawned the US top ten hit \"Lonely No More\". It also features John Mayer's guitar on the single \"Streetcorner Symphony\". The album was released in the DualDisc format, the first major album to be released that way. The album itself is certified Double Platinum by the RIAA in the US and consists of several types of sounds, including dance, pop, Latin, rock, and country, although it can be generally classified as closer to pop than to the rock music of Matchbox Twenty's third studio album, \"More Than You Think You Are\". The album was supported by his 2005–2006 Something to Be Tour.\n\nReception for \"...Something to Be\" was mixed. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said Rob Thomas \"sounds less like his usual tortured self and more like a boy-band veteran who still knows a thing or two about a grabby hook\" and noting that the single \"Streetcorner Symphony\" sounds like \"the world's greatest Black Crowes parody — until you realize Thomas is completely serious\". Browne also commented that the album \"doesn't always snap and crackle the way that single (\"Lonely No More\") does\".\n\nLindsay Whitfield of \"Soul Shine Magazine\" also gave the album and some of its songs a positive review (four stars), saying the album is \"one of the finest, most unique albums of 2006 so far\" and Thomas belts out \"musical perfection to the road trip worthy\". Thomas Inskeep of \"Stylus Magazine\" gave the album a negative review (although the \"C\" rating reflects a more mixed attitude), calling it \"mediocre\" and explaining that the large part of the problem was that \"Rob's a fairly generic songwriter\". Inskeep continued by saying he is \"one of the most processed-cheese-and-Wonder-bread guys around\" and Thomas had \"hopelessly clichéd lines\" on the song \"Ever the Same\".\n\nKevin Forest Moreau of \"Paste\" gave the album a positive review, saying his debut solo album \"certainly sounds different from the adult-alternative diet-rock of Matchbox Twenty-at least half the time\". Moreau complimented the \"punchy horns and a few electronic flourishes\" for being on songs such as \"Streetcorner Symphony\". However, he criticized the \"ponderous poetics...and platitudes\" for being mistaken as depth. Paul Lingas of avrev.com called the album \"a mixed bag with some surprisingly good offerings and some duds that sadly aren’t surprising\" (giving the performance a 5.5 and the sound 6.5), complimenting some of the songs but also calling them \"background music\". He noted that Thomas \"does not have a good singing voice\". Although he also called his voice very distinctive and strong, he said \"too often it is not suited to the surrounding music\". Lingas finished by saying that Thomas' voice is not always well blended with the other sounds and that the mixing is \"poor\" and producing decisions are \"sometimes odd\".\n\n\n"}

It suffered in the marketplace due to thematic similarities with the better received \"Wipeout\" by Psygnosis and the generality of its graphics engine made for a very short depth of view compared to contemporary racing games.\n\nBullfrog later released an addon pack for \"Hi-Octane\" which included additional features made for the Saturn and DOS, including 3 new tracks and new game modes.\n\nThe game offers a choice of six hovercraft vehicles differentiated by their top speed, armour, firepower, weight and appearance: KD-1 Speeder, Berserker, Jugga, Vampire, Outrider, and Flexiwing. There are six tracks to race on, with names like New Chernobyl which hint at a dystopian futuristic world (although the game does not feature a backstory). The tracks offer different difficulties, various textures and types of landscape like wastelands and city streets.\nCertain parts of the track allow to recharge vehicle's fuel, shields or ammo, although the vehicle has to slow down in order to fully benefit of the recharge. There are also power-ups on the tracks, recharging fuel/shield/ammo (10, 100 or 200%) or upgrading the car's minigun, missile or booster, for more power. Other parts of the tracks changed in the course of racing, opening shortcuts or places with scattered upgrades for a short time.\n\nThe different vehicles display different handling values in the front end but these are just for show, the underlying stats are the same for all the vehicles. Due to the dimensions of models the vehicles appear different sizes but in fact the collision volumes are all identical meaning that you are just as likely to hit something with the Outrider as you are with the Jugga.\n\nThere are four camera views, switched while playing: three of them are from behind the vehicle with one being further away than the other, and the fourth view is from the front of the car, with no parts of the car obscuring the sight.\n\nDeveloper Peter Molyneux stated that in May 1995, EA set Bullfrog under pressure to release \"Dungeon Keeper\" in six and a half weeks. \"Because I wasn't prepared to sacrifice \"Dungeon Keeper\", I wrote and designed a game from scratch in six weeks: \"Hi-Octane\",\" Molyneux recounted. To allow the development of the game in such a short time, the \"Magic Carpet\" engine was used. Producer Sean Cooper's account is slightly different, stating that the game was developed in \"eight\" weeks, as a way to \"fill a quarter that didn't have enough revenue\".\n\nMark LeFebvre of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the PC version an 8.2, praising the selection of vehicles, the well-balanced challenge, the secret areas, and the networked eight-player racing, though he did remark that there should have been more than six tracks. A critic for \"Next Generation\" also considered the small number of tracks to be the game's one shortcoming, and gave it overall approval for its use of texture mapping and Gouraud shading, sense of speed, and overall fun gameplay.\n\n\"Maximum\" deemed the Saturn version \"a mildly entertaining but graphically impoverished title for fans of the original only.\" They criticized the port's many graphical shortcomings, particularly the jerky frame rate, heavy slowdown in two-player mode, lack of texture mapping on enemy craft, and clipping polygon scenery which can cause the player's craft to become stuck. They also took issue with the control configuration and bizarre \"hot seat\" multiplayer mode, though they praised the additional courses and selection of cars. In contrast, Rad Automatic of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" called it \"a brilliant title\", applauding the varied abilities and handling of the vehicles, the combat elements, the assortment of multiplayer modes, and the hover vehicle physics. While noting that the conversion was not as outstanding as Sega's arcade ports, he nonetheless found it of acceptable quality. \"GamePro\" concurred with \"Maximum\" that the game has a strong selection of cars and tracks but poor graphics. They also criticized the loose, unresponsive controls and the sounds. \"Next Generation\" likewise commented that \"With its blocky graphics, devilishly slow frame-rate, and nebulous controls, \"Hi-Octane\" simply lacks the focus of most console games.\" He added that the game was very similar to, but clearly inferior to, its contemporaries \"Cyber Speedway\" and \"Wipeout\". However, he also stated that \"One truly awesome concept introduced ... is the realtime morphing tracks which add a great deal to the game's challenge and is sure to be a feature copied in future racing titles.\"\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, \"GamePro\" said the game is \"crippled by gummy controls and slow, repetitive gameplay. Flat, unimaginative graphics and sounds cause further problems. Stick with \"Wipeout\" - \"Hi-Octane\" runs out of gas.\" \"Maximum\" criticized that the drop in frame rate when using the new split screen multiplayer makes the game \"virtually unplayable\" and, like \"GamePro\" and \"Next Generation\", they compared the game unfavorably to \"Wipeout\": \"Whereas \"WipeOut\" required genuine skill to master its cornering and overtaking, the courses in \"Hi-Octane\" have less involving and, with the exception of the odd shortcut, there's very little else to surprise. ... \"WipeOut\" and \"Ridge Racer\" have shown the potential for PlayStation racers, and the Bullfrog offering comes across as little more than a weak PC port.\"\n"}

Sniz is hyperactive and playfully impulsive, traits that resulted in trouble for himself and his roommate, Fondue. Sniz sports a lime-green Mohawk haircut. Fondue was generally nervous as a result of Sniz's rambunctiousness, which resulted in him being on his guard. Fondue sports a blue chef's hat. They live with two other roommates, Snuppa and Bianca.\n\nCreated by Michael Pearlstein (now known as Mike R. Brandon), \"Sniz & Fondue\" was inspired and derived from characters of his short-lived comic series for a small comic book publishing company Northstar called \"Puppy Action!\". He later received a phone call from Linda Simensky, the head of Nickelodeon's programming at the time, who had found the first issue of \"Puppy Action!\" and asked him if he'd be interested in creating a pilot for a potential series. So, he produced the 1992 pilot \"Psyched for Snuppa\" by Stretch Films and Jumbo Pictures, under the self-proclaimed disliked direction of John R. Dilworth, creator of Cartoon Network's \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\". Although the pilot was passed by Nickelodeon in favor of \"Trash-O-Madness\", the pilot of \"Rocko's Modern Life\", The Nickelodeon team liked Sniz and Fondue so much that they spun the characters into a series of segments for \"KaBlam!\". Unfortunately, John R. Dilworth, Jim Jinkins, and David Campbell were only involved in the pilot and had no involvement with the rest of \"Sniz & Fondue\" when it became a part of \"KaBlam!\" (Jim Jinkins and David Campbell had officially moved their jobs to Disney Enterprises when they purchased Jumbo Pictures). John was asked by the board to direct the Sniz and Fondue series in NYC but he declined due to other interests.\n\nMichael Pearlstein was in charge of writing, storyboarding, character designing, creating the title cards and doing additional voices. The first season oversaw the animation at Israeli animation studio Pitchi Poy Animation Productions, which Michael despised due to how off-model the characters ended up being. They also mostly used stock music from Associated Production Music. The cue used for the show's title card was \"Toys for Boys\", composed by Boris Schoska. Eventually for the second and third season, they switched the oversea animation to Funbag Animation Studios in Canada with most of the animation and writing done in New York City, as well as going back to using original music cues with new title cards. Originally, Viacom was considering having the second and third season be animated at Spümcø in California, but Michael convinced them to have it done closely to his friends and family in New York. One of the show's trademarks is that the characters (mostly Sniz) often sing or quote lyrics from real-life songs such as in the episode, \"Stuntbike Sniz\", where Sniz said to Fondue the main chorus of the song \"You're the Inspiration\" as well as the episode \"Crustacean Sensations\" where Sniz was singing The Bee Gees song “Night Fever” while wandering in the woods.\n\nUnfortunately, the series came to an end as Michael decided to leave the series out of frustration due to having to do most of the work in the production, as well as Funbag being on the verge of going bankrupt while working on a TV-adaption for \"Watership Down\". He was offered a half hour time spin-off but due to his departure, the offer was given to Steve Hillenburg for \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". The final episode, \"Hosed!\", ultimately with Pearlstein not involved in any way, aired within the season-three \"KaBlam!\" episode \"It's All In The Wrist\".\n\n\n"}

The crystal violet and bile salts inhibit the growth of Gram-positive organisms which allows for the selection and isolation of gram-negative bacteria. Enteric bacteria that have the ability to ferment lactose can be detected using the carbohydrate lactose, and the pH indicator neutral red.\n\nIt contains bile salts (to inhibit most Gram-positive bacteria), crystal violet dye (which also inhibits certain Gram-positive bacteria), neutral red dye (which turns pink if the microbes are fermenting lactose).\n\nComposition:\n\n\nThere are many variations of MacConkey agar depending on the need. If the spreading or swarming of \"Proteus\" species is \"not\" required, sodium chloride is omitted. Crystal violet at a concentration of 0.0001% (0.001 g per litre) is included when needing to check if Gram-positive bacteria are inhibited. MacConkey with sorbitol is used to isolate \"E. coli\" O157, an enteric\npathogen.\n\nThe medium was developed by Alfred Theodore MacConkey while working as a bacteriologist for the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal.\n\nUsing neutral red pH indicator, the agar distinguishes those Gram-negative bacteria that can ferment the sugar lactose (Lac+) from those that cannot (Lac-).\n\nThis medium is also known as an \"indicator medium\" and a \"low selective medium\". Presence of bile salts inhibits swarming by \"Proteus\" species.\n\nBy utilizing the lactose available in the medium, Lac+ bacteria such as \"Escherichia coli\", \"Enterobacter\" and \"Klebsiella\" will produce acid, which lowers the pH of the agar below 6.8 and results in the appearance of pink colonies. The bile salts precipitate in the immediate neighbourhood of the colony, causing the medium surrounding the colony to become hazy.\n\nOrganisms unable to ferment lactose will form normal-colored (i.e., un-dyed) colonies. Examples of non-lactose fermenting bacteria are \"Salmonella\", \"Proteus\" species, \"Yersinia\", \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" and \"Shigella\".\n\nSome organisms ferment lactose slowly or weakly, and are sometimes put in their own category. These include \"Serratia\" and \"Citrobacter\".\n\nSome organisms, especially \"Klebsiella\" and \"Enterobacter\", produce mucoid colonies which appear very moist and sticky. This phenomenon happens because the organism is producing a capsule, which is predominantly made from the lactose sugar in the agar.\n\nA variant, sorbitol-MacConkey agar, (with the addition of additional selective agents) can assist in the isolation and differentiation of enterohemorrhagic \"E. coli\" serotype \"E. coli\" O157:H7, by the presence of colorless circular colonies that are non-sorbitol fermenting.\n\n"}

In the United States, experiments were made with rings made from bone, rope or wood.\n\nA young British Scout, Bill Shankley, who was responsible for running a workshop and developing ideas for camping equipment at Gilwell Park, became aware of the American rings, and set out to create something similar. The result was the Gilwell Woggle.\n\nOn the origin of the woggle, Shankley said:\n\nThe earliest known reference to a woggle is the June 1923 edition of \"The Scout\". The term was quickly applied to other designs of fastener, of many shapes and sizes, and is today used around the world.\n\nThe word \"ring\" was used in editions of the Scouting handbook \"Scouting for Boys\" until 1929 when Baden-Powell changed it in the 14th edition:\n\nIt [the scarf] may be fastened at the throat by a knot or woggle, which is some form of ring made of cord, metal or bone, or anything you like.\n\nThe Woggle designed by Bill Shankley became known as the Gilwell Woggle, as it has been traditionally presented to leaders who have completed their Wood Badge training. Trained leaders are admitted into 1st Gilwell Park Scout Troop, with the Gilwell Woggle as one of its symbols. Because of its association it is not worn by other Scouts.\n\nThe New Zealand Scouts sometimes use a plastic woggle in the shape of a traditional Maori carved head. More commonly though warranted leaders trained to Gilwell Woggle standard are allowed to wear the \"traditional\" leather Turk's head woggle. Keas, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers all wear either a \"standard\" woggle for their section, or home-made \"special occasion\" woggles such as the tiki mentioned above. Until trained to the Gilwell woggle level, leaders wear a plaited leather woggle with a dome fastening.\n\nOne story relating to the origin of the word woggle is that it was named to rhyme with the word \"boon doggle\" used in America. However the term woggle pre-dates the first known reference to this in 1925. There are a few other references to the word woggle before its adoption by the Scout movement. It is thought that woggle was a verb, with similar meanings to waggle and wobble, in the 16th century. It was in limited use as a noun around 1900.\n\nAlthough the name \"woggle\" is used in many English-speaking countries, in the United States, the term woggle is reserved for the turk's head knot used to secure the neckerchief of Wood Badge participants. In the US, the object used to secure the neckerchief is called a \"neckerchief slide\".\n\nAn early photographic reference to a slide is in the BSA magazine \"Scouting\" of 1 April 1917. The cover for November 1917 issue prominently shows a Scout wearing a slide to hold the neckerchief in place.\n\nIn the BSA magazine \"Scouting\" from August 1923, the term \"slip-on\" and \"slide\" are both referenced. There is an example of a rams head made of bone and an illustration on how to make your own Turk's head slip-on. The article also comments that the neckerchief should be tied using the four-in-hand knot (often used to tie a necktie) when not using a slide. \n\nTwo months later, \"Boys' Life\" magazine repeated many of the article key points. The name slide or neckerchief slide appears as early as October 1923 with a discussion of the slide being a smart addition to the neckerchief and having some benefits over a knot to tie the neckerchief on. The article makes reference to making your own troop or patrol slide. Also in this same article, on page 63, the Slide is referred to as a \"Slip-On\". \n\nThe first appearance of the term \"woggle\" in \"Boys' Life\" was in February 1966 with reference to a question in a quiz, asking what woggle is to a British Scout.\n\nIn the 1930s through the 2000s, \"Boys' Life\" magazine (the Boy Scouts of America youth magazine) promoted the use and making of slides through articles and Slide Contests.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, \"Boys' Life\" sponsored contests for unique slides, and winning designs were featured in the magazine. In the late 1940s, a feature article called \"Slide of the Month\" began to grace the pages. Most of the articles were written by W. Ben Hunt from Hales Corners, Wisconsin under the pen name \"Whittlin' Jim\". Many of the slide ideas were sent into the magazine by Scouts and Scouters as evidenced by the notes Jim included in the article thanking individuals for the slide ideas. After Mr. Hunt's death in the early 1970s, several authors took on the \"Slide of the Month\" responsibility. The last article was printed in March 2001, the \"Rattlesnake\" made from wire, tube, colored tape, beads, and googly eyes. Over 300 Slide of the Month articles appeared in \"Boys' Life\" magazine.\n\n"}
{"id": "1832201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832201", "title": "Culture of El Salvador", "text": "Culture of El Salvador\n\nThe culture of El Salvador is a Central American culture nation influenced by the clash of ancient Mesoamerica and medieval Iberian Peninsula. Salvadoran culture is influenced by Native American culture (Lenca people, Cacaopera people, Maya peoples, Pipil people) as well as Latin American culture (Latin America, Hispanic America, Ibero-America). Mestizo culture and the Catholic Church dominates the country. Although the Romance language, Castilian Spanish, is the official and dominant language spoken in El Salvador, Salvadoran Spanish which is part of Central American Spanish has influences of Native American languages of El Salvador such as Lencan languages, Cacaopera language, Mayan languages and Pipil language, which are still spoken in some regions of El Salvador.\n\nSalvadorans inhabit the lush Central American nation of El Salvador. El Salvador is one of the seven country in the giant isthmus of Central America. The surface of El Salvador features tropical forest, jungles, mountains, volcanoes, plains (savanna), rivers, lagoons, lakes, calderas and the Pacific Ocean. The forests of El Salvador contain a wide diversity of flora and fauna. El Salvador is a home to ecosystems, biomes, living, nonliving natural resources and also home to a plethora of diverse species. In terms of nonliving resources, El Salvador contains rich volcanic soil, fertile earth that gives life to lush vegetation. Native vegetation such as Yucca gigantea, Cassava, Fernaldia pandurata and Crotalaria longirostrata which are used in Salvadoran food. El Salvador also contains gold under its surface, however all type of mining has been abolished in El Salvador. The Native American indigenous ancestors of Salvadorans, have been living in the region for thousands of years. El Salvador is periodically hit with earthquakes and tropical storms, occasionally but rarely by cyclones.\n\nIn El Salvador, the official language is Central American Spanish. Less than one percent of the population speaks the Pipil language, in places such as Izalco and several other towns. However, there is no obligation academically or socially today to learn it, and the language is more commonly spoken by the elderly. Amongst the pre-Columbia languages that still exist common to places such as Izalco and Cacaopera is Nawat Pipil. English is taught as a second language and is commonly spoken by business people, as the country is developing through globalization.\n\nCentral American Spanish is spoken by the majority of the country's population. The language and pronunciation vary depending on the region.\n\nThe main sport played by Salvadorans is association football. The \"Estadio Cuscatlán\" in the capital San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America, with a capacity of just over 45,000. The stadium is the home ground of the El Salvador national football team, as well as club teams Alianza FC and Atletico Marte\n\nThe main football clubs in El Salvador play in the \"Primera División\", which is made up of the top ten clubs. Below the \"Primera División\" exists a second level or \"Segunda División\", made up of 24 teams split into two groups of twelve. There is promotion and relegation between the two divisions at the end of each season.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been the most prominent religious institution in El Salvador since colonial times, with nearly 75% of the population identifying as Roman Catholic. Reformed churches like Anglican, Lutheran, Pentecostal, and Baptists have experienced significant growth since the 1970s. Seventh Day Adventists, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are also experiencing growth in the nation. Today, nearly 20% of the population belongs to one of these churches. Today, over 40% of El Salvador is Evangelical Christian. Small communities of Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists also exist in some parts of the country.\n\nIn El Salvador, there are different costumes used mostly in religious or other festivals, although in some of the older towns, they are still worn regularly. In female clothing, it is common to see elements like a scapular, a shawl, and a cotton headscarf with different coloured adornments. These can be worn with a skirt and a blouse, or with a dress. The normal footwear is sandals. With male clothing, it is common to see a cotton suit or a cotton shirt, worn with modern jeans, sandals or boots, and a cowboy hat. However, these are rural fashions, and there can be many variations depending on the area.Also, 100% cotton shirts are commonly used (also known as guayaberas).\n\nThe music of El Salvador has a mixture of Lenca, Maya, Cacaopera, Pipil and Spanish influences. This music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. Cuban, Colombian, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially \"salsa\" and \"cumbia\". Popular music in El Salvador uses Xylophone, tehpe'ch, flutes, drums, scrapers and gourds, as well as more recently imported guitars and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as \"Xuc\" which originated in Cojutepeque, Cuscatlan. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.\n\nEl Salvador is a hammock cultured country, and a large producer and exporter of hammocks. The valley in which San Salvador City sits upon is dubbed \"The Valley of the Hammocks\" because the Native Americans, used hammocks to repel constant earthquakes. Later, the colonizing Spaniards used the term as an allusion of earthquakes constantly rocking the valley where San Salvador City is, like a hammock. Hammocks are a big part of Salvadoran culture and are often used for afternoon naps. Hammocks swing from doorways, inside living rooms, on porches, in outdoor courtyards, and from trees. Just about everywhere a hammock can be seen hung in all social classes of Salvadoran homes. It is completely socially acceptable to lay around in a hammock all day in this Central American country, that hammocks can be seen from the most humble rural home, to the most prestigious city hotel chains, where there are the colorful and comfortable hammocks. To honor such a pleasure craft, the municipality of \"Concepcion Quezaltepeque\" celebrates its traditional Hammocks Festival, where artisans produce and sell hammocks as a tradition that begun in 1989 and has been celebrated every year since then, between the first and second weekend of November, it is “The Festival of the Hammocks”. Hammocks are sold in every corner in towns and cities.\n\n \nEl Salvador was inhabited by Paleo-Indians, the first peoples who subsequently inhabited, the Americas during the glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. Their intriguing paintings (the earliest of which date from 8000 BC) can still be seen and marveled at in caves outside the towns of Corinto and Cacaopera, both in Morazán. Originating in the Paleolithic period, these cave paintings exhibit the earliest traces of human life in El Salvador; these early Native Americans people used the cave as a refuge, Paleoindian artists created cave and rock paintings that are located in present-day El Salvador.\nThe Lencas later occupied the cave and utilised it as a spiritual place. Other ancient petroglyphs called piedras pintadas (rock paintings) include la Piedra Pintada in San Jose Villanueva, La Libertad and the piedra pintada in San Isidro, Cabañas. The rock petroglyphs in San Jose Villanueva near a cave in (Walter Thilo Deininger National Park) are similar to other ancient rock petroglyph around the country. Regarding the style of the engravings it has been compared by with the petroglyphs of La Peña Herrada (Cuscatlán), el Letrero del Diablo (La Libertad) and la Peña de los Fierros (San Salvador). We can add to the list the sites in Titihuapa, the Cave of Los Fierros and La Cuevona both in ( Cuscatlán ).\n\nNative Americans appeared in the Pleistocene era and became the dominant people in the Lithic stage, developing in the Archaic period in North America to the Formative stage, occupying this position for thousands of years until their demise at the end of the 15th and 16th century, spanning the time of the original arrival in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization of the Americas during the early modern period.\nAbout 40,000 years ago the ancestors of the indigenous people of the Americas split from the rest of the world following the Pleistocene megafauna and then they flourish mightily, evolving in the Americas, from the Lithic stage to the Post-Classic stage, which was brought into an abrupt end about 525 years ago with the infamous mass genocide and cultural extinction caused by Europeans intrusion into the Americas, bringing deaseses and colonizing the Americas with warfare, terrorism, extremists radical Christianity and mass massacres. Only some Native American indigenous groups survived that catastrophe, most of them in Mexico, Central America and South America, with Salvadoran indigenous being one of many who have given rise to all modern Native Americans still alive today.\n\nHistorically El Salvador has had diverse Native American cultures, coming from the north and south of the continent along with local populations mixed together. El Salvador belongs to both to the Mesoamerican region in the western part of the country, and to the Isthmo-Colombian Area in the eastern part of the country, where a myriad of indigenous societies have lived side by side for centuries with their unique cultures and speaking different indigenous languages of the Americas in the beginning of the Classic stage.\nThe Lenca people are an indigenous people of eastern El Salvador where population today is estimated at about 37,000. The Lenca was a matriarchal society and was one of the first civilizations to develop in El Salvador and were the first major civilization in the country. The pre-Conquest Salvadoran Lenca had frequent contact with various Maya groups as well as other indigenous peoples of Central America. The origin of Lenca populations has been a source of ongoing debate amongst anthropologists and historians. Throughout the regions of Lenca occupation, Lenca pottery is a very distinguishable form of Pre-Columbian art. Handcrafted by Lenca women, Lenca pottery is considered an ethnic marking of their culture. Some scholars have suggested that the Lenca migrated to the Central American region from South America around 3,000 years ago, making it the oldest civilization in El Salvador. Guancasco is the annual ceremony by which Lenca communities, usually two, gather to establish reciprocal obligations in order to confirm peace and friendship. Quelepa is a major site in eastern El Salvador. Its pottery shows strong similarities to ceramics found in central western El Salvador and the Maya highlands. The Lenca sites of Yarumela, Los Naranjos in Honduras, and Quelepa in El Salvador, all contain evidence of the Usulután-style ceramics.\nThe Cacaopera people are an indigenous people in El Salvador who are also known as the Matagalpa or Ulua. Cacaopera people spoke the Cacaopera language, a Misumalpan language. Cacaopera is an extinct language belonging to the Misumalpan family, formerly spoken in the department of Morazán in El Salvador. It was closely related to Matagalpa, and slightly more distantly to Sumo, but was geographically separated from other Misumalpan languages.\nThe Xinca people, also known as the Xinka, are a non-Mayan indigenous people of Mesoamerica, with communities in the western part of El Salvador near its border. The Xinka may have been among the earliest inhabitants of western El Salvador, predating the arrival of the Maya and the Pipil. The Xinca ethnic group became extinct in the Mestizo process.\nEl Salvador has two Maya groups, the Poqomam people and the Ch'orti' people. The Poqomam are a Maya people in western El Salvador near its border. Their indigenous language is also called Poqomam. The Ch'orti' people (alternatively, Ch'orti' Maya or Chorti) are one of the indigenous Maya peoples, who primarily reside in communities and towns of northern El Salvador. The Maya once dominated the entire western portion of El Salvador, up until the eruption of the lake ilopango super volcano. Mayan ruins are the most widely conserved in El Salvador and artifacts such as Maya ceramics Mesoamerican writing systems Mesoamerican calendars and Mesoamerican ballgame can be found in all Maya ruins in El Salvador which include Tazumal, San Andrés, El Salvador, Casa Blanca, El Salvador, Cihuatan, and Joya de Ceren.\nAlaguilac people were a former indigenous group located on northern El Salvador. Their language is unclassified. The Alagüilac language is an undocumented indigenous American language that is now extinct. The Alaguilac ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.\nThe Mixe people is an indigenous group that inhabited the western borders of El Salvador. They spoke the Mixe languages which are classified in the Mixe–Zoque family, The Mixe languages are languages of the Mixean branch of the Mixe–Zoquean language family. The Mixe ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.\nEl Salvador has two Nahua peoples, The Mangue language people and the Pipil people. The Mangue people, also known as Chorotega, are an extinct Oto-Manguean language people, indigenous to eastern El Salvador border, near the gulf. The Pipils are an indigenous people who live in western El Salvador. Their language is called Nahuat or Pipil, related to the Toltec people of the Nahuatl Nation and were speakers of early Nahuatl languages. However, in general, their mythology is more closely related to the Maya mythology, who are their near neighbors and by oral tradition said to have been adopted by Ch'orti' and Poqomam Mayan people during the Pipil exodus in the 9th century CE. The culture lasted until the Spanish conquest, at which time they still maintained their Nawat language, despite being surrounded by the Maya in western El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived, Pipil and Poqomam Maya settlements were interspersed throughout western El Salvador. The Pipil are known as the last indigenous civilization to arrive in El Salvador, being the least oldest and were a determined people who stoutly resisted Spanish efforts to extend their dominion southward. The Pipil are direct descendants of the Toltecs, but not of the Aztecs.\nEvidence of Olmec civilization presence in western El Salvador can be found in the ruin sites of Chalchuapa in the Ahuachapan department. Olmec petroglyphs can be found on boulders in Chalchuapa portraying Omlec warriors with helmets identical to those found on the Olmec colossal heads. This suggest that the area was once an Olmec enclave, before fading away for unknown reasons. The Olmecs are believed to have lived in present-day El Salvador as early as 2000 BC. The 'Olmec Boulder, ' is a sculpture of a giant head found near Casa Blanca, El Salvador site in Las Victorias near Chalchuapa. \"Olmecoid\" figurins such as the Potbelly sculpture have been found through this area, in fact most are described as looking primeval proto-Olmec.\n\nAccording to the Salvadoran Government, about 0.23% of the population are of full indigenous origin. The largest most dominant Native American groups in El Salvador are the Lenca people, Cacaopera people, Maya peoples: (Poqomam people/Chorti people) and Pipil people.\n\nThe number of indigenous people in El Salvador have been criticized by indigenous organizations and academics as too small and accuse the government of denying the existence of indigenous Salvadorans in the country. According to the National Salvadoran Indigenous Coordination Council (CCNIS) and CONCULTURA (National Council for Art and Culture at the Ministry of Education ), approximately 600,000 or 10 per cent of Salvadorian peoples are indigenous. Nonetheless, very few natives have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by historically high rates of old-world diseases, absorption into the mestizo population, as well as mass murder during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising (or \"La Matanza\") which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 peasants killed in a short period of time. The 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre occurred on January 22 of that year, in the western departments of El Salvador when a brief peasant-led rebellion was suppressed by the government, then led by Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. The Salvadoran army, being vastly superior in terms of weapons and soldiers, executed those who stood against it. The rebellion was a mixture of protest and insurrection and ended in ethnocide, claiming the lives of anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 peasants and other civilians, many of them indigenous people. Many authors note that since \"La Matanza\" the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous. Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include Sonsonate (especially Izalco, Nahuizalco, and Santo Domingo), Cacaopera, and Panchimalco, in the department of San Salvador\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000); mostly from Palestine (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of Lebanese descent is around 25,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey.\n\nThe history of the Arabs in El Salvador dates back to the end of the 19th century, because of religious clashes, which induced many Palestinians, Lebanese, Egyptians and Syrians to leave the land where they were born, in search of countries where they at least lived in An atmosphere of relative peace. There were also other reasons of a subjective nature, based on the hope of success, of achieving success and fortune and obtaining recognition from others.\n\nArab immigration in El Salvador began at the end of the 19th century in the wake of the repressive policies applied by the Ottoman Empire against Maronite Catholics. Several of the destinations that the Lebanese chose at that time were in countries of the Americas, including El Salvador. This resulted in the Arab diaspora residents being characterized by forging in devoutly Christian families and very attached to their beliefs, because in these countries they can exercise their faith without fear of persecution, which resulted in the rise of Lebanese-Salvadoran, Syrian-Salvadoran and Palestinian-Salvadoran communities in El Salvador.<ref>\n"}

Mezarkabul is known for integrating Anatolian elements into their music. Mezarkabul means 'accepting the grave', 'accepted by the grave' or literally 'grave accept' in Turkish.\n\nMezarkabul was formed in Bursa in 1986 by guitarist Hakan Utangaç and drummer Cenk Ünnü. In 1987, bassist Tarkan Gözübüyük joined, and they started doing live shows. Their first songs were released in 1990 on the self-titled \"Pentagram\" album. In 1992, a second guitarist Demir Demirkan joined the band, as well as a new lead singer, Bartu Toptas, helping Hakan to concentrate on his guitar duties. The new line-up played several gigs until Bartu decided to move back to Sweden. He left the band in March 1992 just when they had started to record the \"Trail Blazer\" album. The voice in the beginning of \"Secret Missile\" is Bartu's. To fill Bartu's void, the Mezarkabul members hired vocalist Ogün Sanlısoy. They released their second album \"Trail Blazer\" in the same year and enjoyed growing popularity, both in Turkey and across the world. In 1993 guitarist Ümit Yılbar was killed by terrorists on the mountain of Cıraf while he was serving the Turkish army. The remaining members recorded \"Fly Forever\" in memory of Ümit Yılbar, but the band recorded more songs that dealt with Yılbar's death: \"1,000 in the Eastland\" and \"Anatolia\" (both from the album \"Anatolia\").\n\nFor the next three years, the band toured in Turkey and other countries. In 1995, vocalist Murat İlkan replaced Ogün, and they started working on their next album, \"Anatolia\", which was released in Turkey in 1997. Several weeks after the release, Century Media approached Mezarkabul for a worldwide release.\nThe lyrics of \"Anatolia\" addressed war, pain and ignorance, often in an unusual way. In \"1,000 in the Eastland\" the lyrics stress that \"thousands of people are dying in the East, all ignored by the West, where one death becomes a tragedy\", at the same time emphasizing that \"fighting with hatred feeds the rich men\". The album has been praised by \"Sea of Tranquility\".\n\nThey released a live album in 1997 called \"Popçular Dışarı\". Guitarist Demir Demirkan departed, and was temporarily replaced with Onur \"Mr. Cat\" Pamukçu.\n\nThe band started recording its next album in 2000 in its own studio in Istanbul. Guitarist Metin Türkcan officially joined the band during the recording session. They composed 17 songs, and decided to split it into two different CDs. In 2001, \"Unspoken\" was released worldwide. In 2002, \"Bir\" was released in Turkey.\n\nFor their releases in Turkey, they use the name \"Pentagram\". However, due to an American doom metal band called Pentagram, they go by the name \"Mezarkabul\" for international releases.\n\nSony Music released in 2008 Mezarkabul's concert album \"1987\", which includes the band's 20th anniversary concert in Bostancı Gösteri Merkezi on 4 February 2007.\n\nThe band celebrated their 25th year with their album \"MMXII. In 2014 they released their live album \"Live MMXII\" which consisted of live performances of the band since 2012.\n\nMezarkabul is often considered to be the pioneers of heavy metal in Turkey. The band's work has inspired all forms of rock music and helped it to gain popularity in Turkey. They were known to collaborate with the late vocalist of Vitamin, Gökhan Semiz, and Vitamin itself. Also, Tarkan Gözübüyük has produced, arranged and performed with numerous artists and bands. Early examples of his work as a contributing artist includes Şebnem Ferah's debut album titled Kadın which was a huge success in Turkey. Later on in 2005, Gözübüyük produced Ferah's album titled Can Kırıkları. Another example, Mor ve Ötesi's groundbreaking album \"Dünya Yalan Söylüyor\" was produced by Gözübüyük. Other than contributions to rock music, Mezarkabul members continued to contribute to popular music as well. Demir Demirkan, as he pursued his solo career, wrote the lyrics and produced the first Turkish song ever to win the Eurovision song contest. Tuna Kiremitçi, of the Vatan newspaper, wrote an article about the band, praising their contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1 (CD)\nDisc 2 (DVD)\n\n\n\n"}

She is the Ghostbusters' secretary, confidante, and occasionally, a ghostbuster herself. She was played by Annie Potts in both movies, and in \"The Real Ghostbusters\" she was voiced initially by Laura Summer, and later on the series by Kath Soucie. In \"Extreme Ghostbusters\", she was voiced by Pat Musick. Potts returned to provide her appearance and voice to Janine in the 2009's \"\".\n\nThroughout most \"Ghostbusters\" media, Janine is often displayed as having a romantic attraction to Egon Spengler. This is shown in the first movie and more prominently in \"The Real Ghostbusters\" cartoons. In \"Ghostbusters II\", however, she becomes involved with Louis Tully, who has become the team's financial advisor and lawyer. Despite this, Janine retains her attraction to Egon throughout the entire \"Real Ghostbusters\" series and into the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" series.\n\nIn \"Janine's Genie\", in which Janine encounters an evil genie after receiving a possessed lamp (unaware that the genie is evil), one of her wishes was for Egon to fall in love with her, and in one instance when she is driving Ecto-1, Egon comments \"Janine, you're beautiful when you drive.\" Egon and Janine share a handful of tender moments throughout the series, but Egon's somewhat stilted emotions often create a barrier between them.\n\nIn \"Ghostbusters\", Janine is hired as the secretary of the Ghostbusters, where she keeps tabs on the clients. She also interviews Winston Zeddemore for the job as the fourth member of the team. Later, she helps Egon interviewing Louis Tully who was possessed by Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster of Gozer. After the battle with Gozer, she is seen outside of 55 Central Park West, hugging Egon, happy to see him alive and well, joining the rest of the Ghostbusters as they drive off in the Ecto-1.\n\nIn \"Ghostbusters II\", she is rehired as secretary by the Ghostbusters, working side-by-side with Louis Tully, who became the team's financial advisor, accountant and lawyer. Later, Peter Venkman assigns her to baby-sit Dana Barrett's baby Oscar. She asks Louis Tully to babysit with her, where she, along with Dana and Louis see Oscar being kidnapped by Dana's boss, Janosz Poha. In order to help the guys fight Vigo the Carpathian, she lends Louis one of Egon's spare suits and a spare Proton pack, so he can join them in the battle. After the battle, she attends a ceremony to restore the Statue Of Liberty, where she and the Ghostbusters are awarded the Key to the City from the mayor.\n\nPotts confirmed that she will reprise her role as Janine in \"\" (2020).\n\nJanine is the youngest daughter of a working-class family. Though her parents, sister, nephew and grandmother all live in Canarsie (as seen in \"Janine's Day Off\"), she has remained in Brooklyn Heights, where she grew up. She tends to wear loud, blocky jewelry and (in early seasons) tends to wear a mini-skirt at work.\n\nIn 1987, Janine owns a convertible red Volkswagen Beetle, which is severely damaged after being loaned to the Ghostbusters in \"Beneath These Streets\". In \"Baby Spookums\" she has a yellow Renault 5 Le Car, although it is not known if this is a loaner/rental or her own car; in later instances she owns a pink Beetle convertible.\n\nOn numerous occasions, Janine has been forced to take up a Ghostbusters uniform and proton pack to bail the guys out of trouble in episodes \"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me A Dream\", \"Janine’s Day Off\", \"Janine Melnitz, Ghostbuster\" and \"Jailbusters\". In the episode \"Janine Melnitz, Ghostbuster\" from Season 2, she borrows one of Peter Venkman's uniforms, and in the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" episode \"A Temporary Insanity\" she borrowed one of Egon Spengler's.\n\nShe has a sharp, sarcastic sense of humor and has been known to make jokes about the Ghostbusters, either to their faces or under her breath, but most of the time she usually gets along with Ray and Winston, while usually having a kind of sibling rivalry with Peter.\n\n of \"Real Ghostbusters\" saw significant changes to the character. In the first two seasons, her portrayal was almost identical to the rude secretary Potts portrayed in the film. However, Season 3 saw Janine get a new voice actor, a new character design, and a softened personality. Notably, her thick Brooklyn accent disappeared.\n\nIn the Season 6 episode \"Janine, You've Changed\", it is revealed that her changes were the result of her wishes to a \"makeoveris lotsabucks\", a demon posing as a fairy godmother (and even referred to as such by Janine herself). This was one of a handful of episodes writer J. Michael Straczynski wrote as a favor to the show's producers, as he could not return as a full-time writer due to other working commitments he had at the time. As such, the demon fed off of Janine's insecurity regarding her looks, and frustration in failing to win Egon's heart. The demon used her magic to blind Egon (and the other Ghostbusters) to Janine's changes, thus making Janine more dependent on the demon for \"improvements\" on her appearance in hopes she would become \"perfect,\" making Egon notice her. Unknown to Janine, the demon was feeding on desire to be \"perfect\" for Egon to slowly strip away her humanity, and turn her into a \"makeoveris lotsabucks\" herself.\n\nNone of the Ghostbusters noticed until Slimer showed them pictures of Janine in their photo album. They demonstrated her startling changes over the years with a hologram projector. The demon had used ectoplasmic energy to alter Janine's cellular and bone structure. When Janine leaves the firehouse to meet the demon alone, the Ghostbusters send Slimer go after her. In the car Egon tells the others, just as he's realizing how much Janine means to him, now he could lose her forever. In the climax of the episode, Janine turns into a \"makeoverus lotsabucks\" with powers similar to those of her \"fairy godmother\" (allowing her to change her own appearance at will). She lashes out at Egon when he comes to her rescue, blaming him for hardly ever acknowledging her affection for him. Egon defeats the demon's hold over Janine by confessing his love for her (the NOW and Marvel UK comics ignore these changes). Egon's confession proves sincere (and is not just a way of defeating the demon), as he and Janine are later seen sitting on a bench together, watching the sun rise. It is here Egon puts his arm round Janine and asks her out on a date.\n\nJanine's character was changed at the suggestion of consultants, who said that they wanted to change the shape of Janine's glasses (which they thought would frighten children), and change her from a feisty character to the \"mother\" of the Ghostbusters group as they felt she was \"too abrasive\". Additionally, the Brooklyn accent was discarded with a change in voice actresses. This, among other reasons, was why writer J. Michael Straczynski left \"The Real Ghostbusters\".\n\nSet six years after the series finale of \"The Real Ghostbusters\", Janine had bounced from various jobs since the Ghostbusters closed down in 1991. Having been recently downsized from her last job she returned to school at the New York City College and amongst the various (and unmentioned) courses she was taking was a paranormal one, where she was reunited with Egon, going on to help him form the new team.\n\nJanine has had brief appearances in the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" Game Boy Color game (only released in Europe) and in the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" game, Code Ecto-1 for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nAnnie Potts reprised her role as Janine in the \"\", once again being the team's secretary, warning them about what's going on, either by calling them or by radio, and making sarcastic comments about the situation. Her physical appearance is quite similar to the way she appeared in the second movie.\n\nJanine appears as a non-playable character in the Ghostbusters Adventure World of \"Lego Dimensions\" voiced by Courtenay Taylor. She has two missions for the player: The first one has the player busts some ghosts for the mayor, while the second one requires the player to assist her in recovering the books for Ray's bookstore after they're scattered by ghosts.\n\nIn the film series and \"\", she was portrayed by Annie Potts.

Hunter Island and Matthew Island, apart, are claimed by Vanuatu as part of Tafea Province, and considered by the people of Aneityum part of their custom ownership, and were claimed by France as part of New Caledonia.\n\nSmall, arid, without fresh water and not easily accessible, the islands had no interest for Britain or France during their colonization of the Pacific in the course of the 18th and 19th centuries. France officially annexed both islands in 1929. In 1965, the United Kingdom also claimed the two islands, as part of the New Hebrides. France conducted a symbolic occupation in 1975. In 1980, on its independence, Vanuatu claimed sovereignty, but made no occupation of the islands. In 1979, Météo-France set up an automatic weather station on one of the islands, and the French Navy regularly visits both of them.\n\nMatthew Island () is in area, with a high stratovolcano located at . The volcanic island is composed of two andesitic-to-dactic volcanic cones, East Matthew and West Matthew, separated by a rocky 200-metre-wide isthmus. The island was discovered by Captain Thomas Gilbert, of , on 27 May 1788, who named it after the owner of his ship. At the time of the discovery, only East Matthew existed and it was described as having only one peak prior to the Second World War.\n\nEast Matthew is the older part of the island, formed from basalt with a half-destroyed, 142-m-high composite volcanic cone that is thought to be composed of three lava flows. There is still some volcanic activity on the island with sulphuric fumaroles rising from craters in the south-east. West Matthew formed in the late 1940s and may have had eruptions as recent as 1976. It is a roughly circular, -high cone with a serrated peak and is composed almost entirely of lava flows and slag. It contains a crater that is breached to the northwest. A lava flow from West Matthew makes up the northwest coast of the island.\n\nAll known historical eruptions have come from West Matthew. After a highly seismically active period in the 1940s, construction of West Matthew began as submarine eruptions built up a new island. The new cone then emitted lava flows. The eruption was a VEI 2. Another VEI 2 eruption from West Matthew took place in October 1954, while a very small (VEI 0) fissure eruption occurred in approximately 1956. This marks the latest confirmed activity on Matthew Island, although tremors took place near the island in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Uncertainty surrounds a report of an eruption in 1828, as well as reports of eruptions in 1966 and 1976.\n\nHunter Island () is also known as Fern or Fearn Island. The first recorded sighting of the island was by Captain Thomas Fearn from his trading ship \"Hunter\" in 1798. It lies east of Matthew Island at . About in area, the island has a domed shape, and is high. It is composed of andesite – dactic lavas and numerous explosion craters dot the volcano. A cone makes up the south part of the island, with its central crater filled by a lava dome. A -deep crater is located on the north-west side of the island. Fumarolic and solfataric activity continues in the north of the island, as well as on the northeast and southeast coasts. Two small eruptions took place in the mid-1800s. In 1835, a lava flow erupted and on 15 March 1841, an explosive eruption took place. In 1895, lava was seen flowing from two craters on the east side of the island. A small (VEI 0) fissure eruption took place in 1903, on the northern side of the island, and produced lava.\n\nHunter Island is symbolically claimed by a micronation, the Federal Republic of Lostisland.\n\n\n\n"}

He was played by Ernie Hudson in both movies and was voiced by Arsenio Hall in the first two seasons of \"The Real Ghostbusters\". Buster Jones provided Winston's voice in the remaining seasons, and he reprised the role in a cameo on \"Extreme Ghostbusters\". Hudson returned to provide his appearance and voice to Zeddemore in 2009's \"\".\n\nIn the original script for \"Ghostbusters\", Winston Zeddemore was intended to be part of the Ghostbusters team from the beginning, a former \"Air Force major something, a demolitions expert\". This was revised in subsequent drafts after Hudson was cast. His character was originally intended to represent the audience, but was rewritten to be \"an outsider and a late addition\" to the Ghostbusters team.\n\nVeteran actor Yaphet Kotto auditioned and was offered the role, but had to drop out due to other commitments. After working with him the previous year on \"Trading Places\", Dan Aykroyd originally wanted Eddie Murphy to play the role of Winston Zeddemore. Aware of his comic abilities, his characterization of Winston would have been in a semi-improvisational style, similar to Bill Murray's performance as Peter Venkman. Murphy was too busy shooting \"Beverly Hills Cop\" to commit.\n\nWinston Zeddemore's first on-screen appearance is in the movie \"Ghostbusters\", when he responds to a help-wanted advertisement the team has posted in an attempt to deal with their sizable workload. Questioned extensively during his application by Janine Melnitz as to whether he believes in a large number of supernatural occurrences and beings (such as UFOs, the Loch Ness Monster and the theory of Atlantis among others), Zeddemore replies, \"If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.\" Later in the movie, having seen the level of paranormal activity present in the city, he remarks, \"This job is definitely not worth eleven-five [$11,500] a year!\"\n\nZeddemore is a religious man to some extent, saying in a discussion in \"Ghostbusters\" that he believes in God and \"loves Jesus' style\". While driving the Ecto-1 with Ray, he voices his thoughts that the sudden spike in ghost appearances might be a sign of the apocalypse, pointing out that while they have come to treat capturing ghosts as routine pest control, in a very real sense the dead are literally \"rising from the grave\".\n\nThough Zeddemore has no previous background in paranormal studies and is not initially a firm believer in the existence of the paranormal, he readily accepts the existence of ghosts and the supernatural as he encounters them as a Ghostbuster. However, despite this, he continues to act as an 'everyman' and voice of reason for the team, and when the jailed Ghostbusters seriously proposes asking a U.S. federal judge to release them because they must fight an invading god, Zeddemore reminds the others that no one will believe their claims.\n\nAt the start of the sequel \"Ghostbusters II\", the team has been forced out of business due to legal injunctions and property damage lawsuits. Zeddemore and Ray Stantz work as unpopular children's entertainers, but rejoin the team after the ban against them is lifted. Winston helps Ray and Egon investigate the mysterious river of slime under the city, being \"hit\" by the specter of a train that derailed decades earlier and caused hundreds of deaths. Later, he helps them pilot the Statue of Liberty (suffused with slime charged by positive emotions) through New York City to rally the public and defeat Vigo the Carpathian. Ray remarks that the slime reminds him of Jell-O, a dessert Winston hates.\n\nHudson confirmed that he will reprise his role as Zeddemore in \"\" (2021).\n\nMany details of Zeddemore's personality and character are revealed in episodes of \"The Real Ghostbusters\". The episode \"Cry Uncle\" clarifies that, in the show's continuity, Winston has no doctorate; he also informs Egon's skeptical Uncle Cyrus that, prior to becoming a Ghostbuster, he too doubted the existence of ghosts. In \"Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream,\" Winston states that, unlike his three colleagues, he is not a scientist, causing him to doubt his ability to resolve a crisis when the Sandman traps the others within their own dreams, but with encouragement from a dream-version of Albert Einstein, he meets the challenge and wins the day. \"The Ghostbusters in Paris\" reveals that Winston was once a construction worker prior to joining the Ghostbusters. This idea seems to be further reinforced in the episode \"The Brooklyn Triangle\", when the Ghostbusters respond to a construction site headed by his father; this would indicate that it might have been a family business, until Winston decided to join the Ghostbusters.\n\nIn the episode \"Devil To Pay\", Zeddemore mentions having a girlfriend, though she is never seen on screen during the series. In \"Night Game\", he is shown to love baseball, and his favorite team is the Jaguars. In several other episodes it is shown that Zeddemore loves mystery novels and detective stories, and in \"Boodunnit\" he is the one who solves the mystery novel left behind by a deceased mystery writer similar to Agatha Christie, allowing her soul to rest. In \"Doctor, Doctor\" it is revealed that Zeddemore also likes classical literature, including the works of Herman Melville and Charles Dickens. He is also a fan of The Alan Parsons Project. \"The Brooklyn Triangle\" introduces Winston's father, Ed, who works in construction. Their relationship is shown to have been strained because of Winston choosing to be a Ghostbuster, but they reconcile by the end of the episode.\n\nFinally, in the episode \"The Moaning Stones\", Zeddemore is revealed to be the reincarnation of Shima Buku, a shaman at war with an immortal demon known only as the Undying One.\n\nWinston is the primary driver of Ecto-1 for more than a few moments in the two films. As a result, he is almost always shown driving the car in \"The Real Ghostbusters\" cartoon, and is often seen performing routine maintenance such as oil changes on the vehicle. In an episode of the cartoon where the Ghostbusters are sent back in time to the 1950s, Winston sees Ecto-1 in its original role as a hearse telling the other Ghostbusters he would know the vehicle anywhere, he says to the car, \"Hang in there Ecto--better days are ahead for you\", illustrating how fond Zeddemore is of the car.\n\nWinston only appears in the two-part series finale. After the closing down of the Ghostbusters, Winston got his pilot's license, being the first and only Ghostbuster to be a certified pilot.\n\nErnie Hudson appears as himself in the episode \"Slime Busters\" of \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show\".\n\nWinston was featured as a playable character in \"Ghostbusters II\" for NES.\n\nWinston was featured as a playable character in \"New Ghostbusters II\" for NES and Game Boy.\n\nA likeness of Hudson, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the \"\" that was released on June 16, 2009. Hudson also reprised his role for the game by voicing him. In the game, between the Vigo incident and Thanksgiving 1991, Winston has acquired his doctorate, is now addressed as \"Doctor\" along with his colleagues. Zeddemore can be heard quipping \"That's Dr. Zeddemore to you, punk!\" when defeating enemies. He mentions that he \"pretty much lived\" in the museum's exhibit on ancient Egypt while working on getting it, revealing that his degree is in Egyptology.\n\nOn his one day off, Winston went to go see a performance of the Aida opera. However, the Psi Energy Pulse officially cancelled his plans. After Janine delivered the message, Winston left to meet up with the other Ghostbusters at the Sedgewick Hotel. He endured four hours of traffic but made it to the hotel just in time to sight the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. During their final confrontation, Ivo Shandor mocks Winston, saying that he always thought Winston was the \"slow\" one of the group, much to Winston's surprise. When Shandor is destroyed, everyone flees the mausoleum. Winston carries the exorcised Mayor Mulligan outside until he regains consciousness.\n\nZeddemore appears in Beeline Interactive's \"Ghostbusters\" game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013.\n\nZeddemore appears in \"Lego Dimensions\", with archival audio of Ernie Hudson being used to represent his character.\n\nThe name \"Zeddemore\" is misspelled as \"Zeddmore\" in the closing credits of \"Ghostbusters\". As a result it was also sometimes misspelled in scripts and other sources related to \"The Real Ghostbusters\". The name is spelled correctly on the nametag on Winston's jumpsuit, in the shooting script of \"Ghostbusters\" (as published in the book \"Making Ghostbusters\"), and in the closing credits of \"Ghostbusters II\". The name is also pronounced correctly (with three syllables) by both Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson in \"Ghostbusters\".\n\n"}

He was a Liberal member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1990, and represented the central Ontario riding of Muskoka–Georgian Bay. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.\n\nBlack was born in Bracebridge, Ontario and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1955. He was a secondary school teacher and principal from 1958 to 1980, and was superintendent of the Muskoka Board of Education from 1980 to 1987. He has also served as past president of Muskoka Children's Aid. He and his wife, Beth raised four children.\n\nBlack joined the Ontario Liberal Party in 1985. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election defeating Progressive Conservative candidate George Beatty in Muskoka–Georgian Bay, a new riding created by redistribution. Previously the area was represented by the riding of Muskoka which had been held by former Progressive Conservative premier Frank Miller until 1987, and the PCs were historically the dominant party in the area. Black was considered a strong candidate, however, and his victory was not entirely unexpected. Black credited his victory to a strong campaign team, popular satisfaction with Liberal leader David Peterson, and the fact that some local PCs were unhappy with party leader Larry Grossman.\n\nIn August 1988, Peterson appointed Black as a one-man task force to review government and non-government programs against drug abuse. His report, issued in mid-October, recommended mandatory drug education starting in the early grades, drug treatment and education programs for offenders, increased training about drugs for social workers and health care workers, and the addition of about thirty-six officers to the provincial drug unit. Black criticized the \"zero tolerance\" approach of the American \"war on drugs\", arguing that it was largely ineffective.\n\nAfter the report's release, Black was named special advisor to the premier on drugs with responsibility for co-ordinating and monitoring all government programs against drug abuse. In December 1988, he announced a pilot project for substance abuse counselling operated by the YMCA of Metropolitan Toronto.\n\nBlack was promoted to the provincial cabinet on August 2, 1989, serving as Minister of Tourism and Recreation and also responsible for the provincial anti-drug strategy. He introduced a new provincial anti-drug strategy in November 1989 that fulfilled some of his previous recommendations, including the hiring of more police officers and the introduction of early education programs. It also allocated $4.5 million for community-based pilot projects against drug abuse. In June 1990, heannounced that this funding would be targeted to projects in nine communities.\n\nBlack was critical of the federal Goods and Services Tax introduced by the government of Brian Mulroney, arguing that it would put Ontario's tourism sector at risk of losing jobs and revenue. Tourism in Ontario declined in this period, due in large part to a continental economic downtown.\n\nBlack travelled to Paris in December 1989 to support Toronto's bid to host Expo 2000. Toronto lost the bid Hanover, West Germany.\n\nBlack's time in cabinet was brief. The Liberals suffered an upset loss to the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, and Black finished third in his bid for re-election. In 1991-92, he was chief organizer for Charles Beer's unsuccessful bid to succeed Peterson as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. He attempted to return to the provincial legislature in the 1995 election, but finished well behind Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Grimmett.\n\nBlack later served as president of the Muskoka Heritage Foundation, and founded the Muskoka Watershed Council in 2001. He was appointed as a director of the Toront03 Alliance in July 2003. On August 29, 2016 he died from an undiagnosed case of acute leukemia.\n"}

Universally the term refers to the group of middle class households or individuals who have not attained the status of the upper middle class associated with the higher realms of the middle class, hence the name.\n\nIn American society, the middle class may be divided into two or three sub-groups. When divided into two parts, the lower middle class, also sometimes simply referred to as \"middle class\", consists of roughly one third of households, roughly twice as large as the upper middle or managerial class. Common occupation fields are semi-professionals, such as lower-level managers, small business owners and skilled craftsmen. These individuals commonly have some college education or perhaps a Bachelor's degree and earn a comfortable living. Already among the largest social classes, rivaled only by the working class, the American lower middle class is diverse and growing.\n\nThough not common in sociological models, the middle class may be divided into three sections in vernacular language usage. In this system the term lower middle class relates to the demographic referred to as working class in most sociological models. Yet some class models, such as those by sociologist Leonard Beeghley, suggest the middle class to be one cohesive socio-economic demographic, including the demographics otherwise referred to as lower, simply middle or upper middle class in one group comprising about 45% of households.\n\nThe lower-middle class is frequently portrayed in television and film. Notable examples include the television shows \"The Simpsons\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"Married... with Children\", \"2point4 children\", \"The Middle\", \"Family Guy\", \"Family Matters\" and \"Veronica Mars\" as well as films such as \"Lady Bird\" and \"Soul Food\".\n\n\n"}

In 1992 he began to pursue journalism as a career. He started out writing for Catholic publications such as \"Il nostro tempo\" (\"Our time\"), then worked under the renowned journalist Indro Montanelli for newspapers such as \"Il Giornale\" and \"La Voce\" and gained the attention of Montanelli himself who once said of him: \"No, Travaglio does not kill anyone. With a knife. He uses a more refined and not legally punishable weapon: the archives\". Between 2006 and 2011, Marco Travaglio was a regular guest of the TV program \"AnnoZero\", hosted by Michele Santoro (also mentioned by Berlusconi in the so-called Bulgarian Edict). Recently, Travaglio has contributed as a columnist to prominent national newspapers and magazines, such as \"La Repubblica\", \"L'Unità\" (hosting columns such as \"Bananas\", \"Uliwood Party\" and \"Zorro\") and \"Micromega\". He still contributes to \"L'espresso\" writing a column by the name \"Signornò'\". In September 2009 he contributed to the founding of the independent newspaper \"Il Fatto Quotidiano\" (\"The Daily Fact\"). He became editor in chief of the paper in 2015.\n\nPolitical and judicial events of national importance, from \"Mani pulite\" to the troubles of controversial political figure Silvio Berlusconi, have been Travaglio's main area of interest. The journalist gained public attention in 2001, after participating in a TV show on state-owned national channel Raidue called \"Satyricon\" and hosted by Daniele Luttazzi. He then introduced his bestseller book \"L'odore dei soldi\" (\"The Scent of Money\", co-authored by :Elio Veltri), which investigates the origin of Mr Berlusconi's early fortunes. Berlusconi filed a lawsuit for slander, but since the information was accurate and well documented, he was condemned to pay the legal expenses. The show, aired during the campaign for the Italian general election, was heavily criticized by Berlusconi and his party and labeled by them as a politically motivated, non-objective personal attack. After Mr Berlusconi's victory at the elections, Berlusconi banned Luttazzi (together with Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, prominent journalists that had criticized Mr Berlusconi's or investigated his history) from state-owned TV shows (\"Editto Bulgaro\"), causing a long debate about freedom of information and censorship in Italy.\n\nOn 10 May 2008, Marco Travaglio commented on Renato Schifani's election as president of the Senate that one should \"simply ask of the second highest office of the state to explain those relationships with those men who have subsequently been condemned for association with the Mafia\" on the RAI current affairs talk show television program \"Che tempo che fa\". The statement of Travaglio resulted in fierce negative reactions from Italian politicians, including from the centre left, except for Antonio Di Pietro who said that Travaglio was \"merely doing his job\". Some called for chief executives at RAI to be dismissed. The political commentator (and future leader) Beppe Grillo supported Travaglio, while Schifani announced he would go to Court and sue Travaglio for slander. Schifani said Travaglio's accusation was based on \"inconsistent or manipulated facts, not even worthy of generating suspicions\", adding that \"someone wants to undermine the dialogue between the government and the opposition.\"\n\nIn 2009, the German Association of Journalists assigned Travaglio its annual award for Freedom of the Press, describing him as a \"brave and critical colleague [...] exposing continually the attempts of Italian politicians, especially Silvio Berlusconi, to influence the media to their advantage and to negate critical reports.\"\n\nTravaglio is a Roman Catholic.\n\n\nBooks by Marco Travaglio (usually co-authored with other investigative journalists) include:\n\n"}

Historically, dumy were performed by itinerant Cossack bards called kobzari, who accompanied themselves on a kobza or a torban, but after the abolition of Hetmanate by the Empress Catherine of Russia the epic singing became the domain of blind itinerant musicians who retained the kobzar appellation and accompanied their singing by playing a bandura (rarely a kobza) or a relya/lira (a Ukrainian variety of hurdy-gurdy). \nDumas are sung in recitative, in the so-called \"duma mode\", a variety of the Dorian mode with raised fourth degree.\n\nDumy were songs built around historical events, many dealing with the military actions in some form. Embedded in these historical events were religious and moralistic elements. There are themes of the struggle of the Cossacks against enemies of different faiths or events occurring on religious feast-days. Although the narratives of the dumy mainly revolve around war - the dumy themselves do not promote courage in battle. The dumy impart a moral message in which one should conduct oneself properly in the relationships with the family, the community, and the church. However, the kobzari did not play only religious songs and dumy. They also played “satirical songs (sometimes openly scabrous); dance melodies; either with or without words; lyric songs; and historical songs”.\n\nThe relationship between the military and the religion with dumy originated in the Cossack rebellion of 1648. Ukraine fell under the control of the Catholic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, that imposed discriminatory measures on the Eastern Orthodox Church. This rebellion was followed by “partition and eventual subjugation of the Ukrainian lands and the Ukrainian church. The Cossacks rebelled against the religious oppression and their lands were eventually lost to the oppressor. This causes a great dilemma in the church because the Cossacks were defenders of the faith, and since they lost, and the faith is infallible, the Cossacks themselves must have done something sinful. This is why dumy has a great religious undertone and is a song that tells of death and defeat, not of victory.\n\nDumy, as an epic, in comparison to other epic forms do not contain elements of fantasy.\n\nThe dominant element of dumy is language. Rhythm is rhetorical, often falling on a verb placed at the end. The use of parallelisms is widespread, epithets are standard, the use of specific numbers is also widespread. The use of archaic forms of language are also popular as is the use of retardation.\n\nThe melodies of dumy consist of\n\nAlmost all traditional dumy from the Poltava and Slobozhan traditions use a Dorian mode with occasionally raised 4th degrees and subseptatonium. The raised 4th often is used as a secondary leading note to the dominant. The appearance of the augmented 2nd between the 3rd and 4th degrees gives the duma an eastern sounding flavour and is used by the performer to add \"zhal'\" (pity) to the work.\n\nDumy are traditionally sung to an instrumental accompaniment, usually that of a bandura, kobza or lira.\n\nIn the Slobozhan tradition the bandura would play most of the notes of the melody with the voice apart from chromatic accidentals and melisma with occasional chords on I, IV and V degrees of the Dorian mode. The instrument would also be used for instrumental preludes, interludes and postludes.\n\nIn the Poltava tradition the instrumental accompaniment is much sparser with the player not playing the melody but rather occasional chords based on the tonic and dominant of the Dorian.\n\nIn lira accompaniment from Poltava, no melodies are played with the voice during the performance of the duma. Melodic instrumental playing is confined to preludes, interludes and postludes.\n\nNo transcriptions or recordings of authentic duma performance by members of the Chernihiv tradition have come down to us.\n\nDiscussion regarding other traditions of duma recitations have shown a significant amount of contamination in the 20th century from non-traditional sources which has rendered many of their recordings atypical and unauthentic according to the traditional style in which the kobzari performed dumy.\n\nMusicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 7 (1965): 247-251.\nSlavic Review 50 (1991): 566-575.\n"}

The numbering plan area (NPA) originally included most of the southern and northeastern parts of Wisconsin, stretching from Lake Michigan to the Minnesota and Iowa borders. 715, then as now, covered the remaining northwestern part.\n\nThe numbering plan area was first split in 1955, when much of the western portion, including Madison, received area code 608. This configuration remained in place until July 26, 1997, when the northern half, including Green Bay and the Fox River Valley, became numbering plan area 920.\n\nThe creation of 920 was intended as a long-term solution, but within a year 414 was close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. In 1998, the North American Numbering Plan Administration assigned area code 262 as a second area code for southeastern Wisconsin. The initial proposal called for 262 to be an overlay for the 414 territory. However, overlays were a new concept at the time, and met with considerable resistance due to the requirement for ten-digit dialing. As a result, effective September 25, 1999, the new area code was implemented as a geographic split, with nearly all of the old 414 territory outside of Milwaukee County transferring to 262.\n\nToday, area code 414 covers all of Milwaukee County, including the city of Milwaukee. It also serves slivers of Waukesha County, including portions of Muskego and Brookfield, as well as the industrial \"Ambrosia triangle\" which is within the Milwaukee city limits. The Milwaukee portion of Washington County, mostly an industrial area, also stayed in 414 after the split.\n\nMilwaukee is the center of one of the largest toll-free calling zones in the country. No long-distance charges are applied from one portion of the 414 territory to another; portions of the 262 territory, such as Racine, Waukesha, and Menomonee Falls, are a local call to and from Milwaukee as well. Area code 414 is one of only a few urbanized area codes without an overlay; only seven digits are needed when dialing local calls within the county. This makes Milwaukee one of the largest cities where seven-digit dialing is still possible. Under current projections, it will stay that way for the foreseeable future; the latest projections did not list an exhaust date for 414. Despite the Milwaukee area's rapid growth, 414 is nowhere near exhaustion.\n\nThe area code gained infamy in 1983, when a gang of six Milwaukee-area teenagers, calling themselves The 414s, broke into several high-profile computer systems across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe City of Milwaukee started celebrating Milwaukee Day in 2009. It is celebrated on April 14, or 4-14, in honor of Milwaukee's area code.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks' new arena, Fiserv Forum, was nicknamed the \"Four-One-Forum\" by fans in an homage to the area code.\n\n"}

Now, over 90% of Spanish dialects exhibit this phonemic merger. Similar mergers exist in other languages, such as French, Italian, Hungarian, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese or Galician, with different social considerations.\n\nOccasionally, the term \"lleísmo\" () has been used to refer to the maintenance of the phonemic distinction between (spelled \"y\") and (spelled \"ll\").\n\nMost dialects that merge the two sounds represented by and realize the remaining sound as a voiced palatal fricative , which is similar to the in English \"your\", but it sometimes sounds like in English \"jar\", especially after or or at the beginning of a word. For example, \"relleno\" is pronounced and \"conllevar\" is pronounced or .\n\nIn most of Argentina and Uruguay, the merged sound is pronounced as a sibilant ; this is referred to as \"zheísmo\". In Buenos Aires, the sound has recently been devoiced to (\"sheísmo\") among younger speakers.\n\nRioplatense does not, however, use the sibilant sound for word-initial (spelt \"hi-\" + vowel).

However, orthographic mistakes are common (for example, writing \"llendo\" instead of \"yendo\"). A notable case is the name of the island of \"Mallorca\": since Mallorcans tend to pronounce intervocalic /ʎ/ as /j/, central Catalan scribes assumed the authentic (and correct) name \"Maiorca\" was another case of this and hypercorrected it to \"Mallorca\". This new form ended up becoming the usual pronunciation, even for native Mallorcans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

But behind the entertainer lies a serious artist, whose extended composition in memory of Jana Obrovska proved fully capable of stirring emotions at the other end of the scale. Never was a standing ovation more richly deserved. Pavel Steidl had won the hearts and minds of a capacity crowd.\"\n\nSince he won first prize at the Radio France International Competition in Paris in 1982, he has become one of the most widely celebrated soloists of his generation. Among the members of the jury were such artists as Alexandre Tansman, Antonio Lauro and Maria Luisa Anido.\n\nBefore that he studied with such guitarist as Milan Zelenka and Štěpán Rak in Prague.\nIn 1987 he decided to emigrate to the Netherlands where after years of studying and getting inspiration from many different artists he has created his own style which is not ignoring authentic way of interpretation 19th-century guitar literature on periodic instruments and going far to some world music elements.\nPavel Steidl also composes himself and his own compositions are often played on his concerts.\nHe played in more than 40 countries of the world from among Canada, USA, China, India, Japan, Europe, South and Central America and many others.\nOn demand of Italian Guitar Magazine Guitart the readers decided to choose him as a guitar player of the year 2004 .\nPavel Steidl plays many instruments, but mainly Francisco Simplicio (1926) and Franz Butcher (2008), romantic guitar: copies of J.G.Stauffer guitar made by B.Kresse and original instrument from the beginning of the 19th century Nikolaus G.Ries cca. 1830\n\nIn his teaching, Pavel's approach is encouraging but subtle.

It forms within the Cordillera Central mountain range southwest of the city of Bonao and passes through the fertile Cibao Valley. The river from there turns north-northeast passing the city of Bonao along the way. Southwest of Cotuí, the river reaches Hatillo Dam (Spanish: \"Presa de Hatillo\") before turning northeast then east as it reaches its mouth at the Samaná Bay in the northeast part of the Dominican Republic. Like many rivers in the Dominican Republic, the name is derived from the Taíno language.\n\nThe source of the Yuna is located southeast of the city of Santiago and northwest of the city of Santo Domingo. The source is located near the southern Monseñor Nouel village of La Cuesta de la Vaca within the municipality of Bonao on Cerro Montoso Hill (Spanish: \"Loma de Cerro Montoso\") at an elevation of above sea level. The Cerro Montoso Hill lies along the highest mountain range in the West Indies, the Cordillera Central. The Cordillera Central provides the principal watershed and drainage divide for the Dominican Republic; the Yuna has its source along the northern slope of the mountain range. The Yuna descends from its headwaters running south then west where several streams feed into the river near the San José de Ocoa province border. The Yuna then turns north near the village of El Torito passing through several mountains including Torito Hill (Spanish: \"La Loma del Torito\"), and Middle Hill (Spanish: \"La Loma El Medio\"). The Yuna shifts north-northwest near the Middle Hill passing through several villages including Pino de Yuna, Piedra de los Veganos, and El Capa.\n\nThe Yuna next flows into the village of Los Finitos where it travels in a more northerly course. The river then receives two tributaries along its left bank: the Blanco and Tireo River. The Yuna then heads northeast into lower elevations as the river leaves the Cordillera Central. The river passes through the village of Los Quemados, receiving several forks that originate within the Cordillera Central to the west. The river next bypasses Bonao to the northwest of the city. The Yuna then flows into the town of Los Arroces, receiving a major tributary, the Masopedro River, on the left bank. The Yuna then heads east passing under the Autopista Duarte before entering another mountainous region of Monseñor Nouel. The Yuna next passes north of Falconbridge Ltd., a major economic income for the Bonao area. The Yuna heads east as it cuts through several mountains in this region including the Flat Hill (Spanish: \"La Loma del Llano\") where the Yujo River converges onto the Yuna. The river accompanies the Sánchez Ramírez Province line east of Flat Hill and enters the province upon arriving at Lake Hatillo (Spanish: \"Presa de Hatillo\") in the municipality of Cotuí where it joins the Maimón River.\n\nLake Hatillo runs north-northeast for and has a total area of from the Yuna–Maimón convergence to a hydroelectric dam located southwest of Cotuí. The reservoir, surrounded by rolling hills, is the largest artificial lake and is home to the largest dam in the Caribbean. The Hatillo dam in the Yuna River is an example of a dam with flood control purposes. The Yuna continues past the dam running northeast while decreasing in elevation and receiving first the Maguaca River and later the Chacuey River along the right bank. The Yuna bypasses the city of Cotuí to the north and enters a Sánchez Ramírez region filled with cocoa orchards. The Yuna receives its principal tributary, the Camú River, approximately northeast of Cotuí at the Duarte Province line at an elevation of above sea level. The Camú River has its source within the Cordillera Central and has a watershed that spans seven provinces: La Vega, Santiago, Monseñor Nouel, Hermanas Mirabal, Sánchez Ramírez, and Duarte. The Yuna turns east after receiving the Camú River along its left bank and now serves as the Sánchez Ramírez-Duarte Province line, heading into wetlands filled with rice and cocoa cultivation. The easternmost segment of the Yuna past the mouth of the Camú River has the most s-shaped curves of any segment in its course. The Yuna continues to decrease in elevation as it heads east reaching above sea level upon entering Duarte Province and the municipality of Eugenio Maria de Hostos where it meets two small tributaries along its left bank: the Nigua and Yaiba Rivers.\n\nThe Yuna next heads into the municipality of Villa Riva running east-northeast while descending into elevations of above sea level. The Yuna passes north of Los Haitises National Park where it meets the Cevicos River along its right bank. The Yuna then traverses a region with several lagoons and wetlands and heads north to the town of Villa Riva before turning southeast and receiving the Payabo River on its right bank. The Yuna next passes beneath Autopista Juan Pablo II upon briefly entering the municipality of Arenoso and continues east passing several small villages including Los Coles and Agua Santa del Yuna. The Yuna continues east into the village of Los Cacaos where the Yuna serves as the Duarte–Samaná Province line in a region filled with marshlands and cienegas. The Yuna next arrives at the long Barracote River which separates from the right bank of the Yuna. The Barracote runs southeast-east as it reaches its mouth at the Samaná Bay (Spanish: \"Bahía de Samaná\") in the municipality of Sánchez at an elevation of above sea level. The main branch of the Yuna continues northeast receiving the Guayabo River on its left bank before traveling east into Samaná Province. The Yuna finally reaches its delta within Los Haitises National Park approximately south of the city of Sánchez and north of the Barracote River mouth. The delta is located within the Lower Yuna Mangroves (Spanish: \"Manglares del Bajo Yuna\") and empties into the Samaná Bay., which is one of the largest estuaries in the Caribbean. There is a long period when the Yuna River provides Samana Bay with a flow of stable and low freshwater, as well as two times of the year when the Yuna River rises and provides the Bay with a flow of large freshwater. In total the Yuna River, is 208 km long.\n\nA primary usage for the Yuna River, where it travels along the city of Bonao, is for the cultivation of rice.\n\nNoted by Barzman and Peguero (1995) in \"Impacts of Altered Freshwater Flows to Estuaries: Yuna River Watershed and Samana Bay\" (Jim Tobey, 2004) “agrochemical use for rice cultivation in the Yuna watershed is contributing to loss in soil fertility and to increases in pests, weeds, and diseases, which, in turn, require increases in the already high use of the same agrochemicals.” (Tobey, 2004, 31)\n\nAlthough most of the Yuna River bed is vegetated, but there is a high amount of gravel south of Bonao.\n"}

The founders, before founding Remo, had abandoned Sport Club do Pará. On 14 February 1908, Remo was closed, after the club's general assembly. On 29 March 1908, Remo's partners and Sport Club do Pará made a deal, and Remo was officially extinct in 1908. On 15 August 1911, Remo was reorganized following the initiative of Antonico Silva, Cândido Jucá, Carl Schumann, Elzaman Magalhães, Geraldo Motta, Jayme Lima, Norton Corllet, Oscar Saltão, Otto Bartels and Palmério Pinto.\n\nIn 1950, Remo held a tour to Venezuela at the invitation of the football federation of the country to compete in the Caracas International Tournament, which, according to some publications, may have been the precursor of the Little World Cup, played between the 1950s and 1960s. The team held five matches, getting four wins (La Salle, Unión, Military School and Deportivo Italia) and only one loss to Loyola, considering the higher strength of the Venezuelan football at the time. Remo is still seeking official recognition of the title by the CONMEBOL. If accepted, will be the first international title in club history.\n\nRemo also has great campaigns on the national scene. His most outstanding campaigns were the 7th place in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 1993 and the semifinals in the Copa do Brasil in 1991 – these results represent the best performance of a northern team in the history of both competitions.\n\nIn 2005, the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série C. This was the club's first national title. The club also has three titles in the Taça Norte and 1 Torneio Norte-Nordeste, as well as being one of the largest state winners.\n\nThe first Remo's emblem consisted of a navy blue rectangle, with the center a white anchor, in obliquely, circulated by thirteen stars of the same color. After the reorganization of 1911, the anchor gave way to a format shield similar to a buoy lifeguard, crossed by a pair of oars. At the top was the description \"Grupo do Remo\" and the environment, the initials \"GR\" intertwined.\n\nIn 1914, the college is renamed \"Clube do Remo\". With this change, the shield also is renewed. The circular uniformity of the previous badge is maintained by adding the typical symmetrical side cut-outs of British heraldry - heritage of some founders of the club with academic training in Europe, especially in England. The acronym GR gives way to the CR.\n\nOver the years, the shield has undergone some changes, without change your style. The last change occurred in 2013, seeking to rescue the origins of the club and to combine the concept of modernity. According to the Brand Manual, the Bluean shield now has a finish on the sidelines and superior to characterize volume and three-dimensionality, in addition to the reversal of the stars color according to the degree of importance of each title - five white representing the five state titles consecutive and golden, representing the national title of Campeonato Brasileiro Série C in 2005.\n\nThe hymn of Clube do Remo came to an adjustment made by the poet Antônio Tavernard the carnival march created by Emílio Albim for block Cadetes Azulinos, created in 1933 and was formed by athletes, members, leaders and supporters who roamed the streets of Belém bound Republic Square. Tavernard exchanged 30 march of words to create the anthem of Azulinos Athletes, first published in the newspaper \"O Estado do Pará\" on 4 November 1941.\n\nRaul Engelhard, one of the founders of the Grupo do Remo, on 5 February 1905, had been a student in England. Rowing Club supporter, also party race, has proposed that the official color of Remo was the same of Rowing: the United Kingdom's imperial blue. In 1911, the Grupo do Remo (regattas) turned \"Clube do Remo\" and, two years later, already disputed the first Campeonato Paraense, with horizontal stripes shirts in Navy Blue and white.\n\nSince it emerged, the club features navy blue and white as its official colors. Thus, the main uniforms of all types adopt navy blue as the predominant color, reversing the order in secondary uniforms. The shirt used by the team in his first football match had horizontal stripes.\n\nIn the 1970s, the prestigious magazine Revista Placar, elected the best supported clubs in each Brazilian state and the \"Leão Azul\" again confirmed its supremacy in Pará. In the 90s contributed further to the increase in Clube do Remo fans, due to the large made the club in this period: eight state titles, large national campaigns and supremacy in the Classic King of the Amazon (the taboo history of 33 games without losing for the biggest rival).\n\nHowever, from the 2000s, the Clube do Remo began to get into a turbulent period in its history with successive failures in national competitions like the relegation for the Série C in 2005 and getting even without play a national championship three times.\n\nDespite the difficulties, the fans, contrary to expectations, only increased. Proof of this was the IBOPE which ranked the Clube do Remo as the largest North of Brazil and the 16th in the ranking of the largest supporters of the country, besides being the northern fastest growing among fans in the range of 10 to 15 years, surpassing clubs like Botafogo, Fluminense and Coritiba. In Belém, Remo focuses its biggest fans. Currently, bluish appearance ranging from 1 million to 2 million.\n\nRemo's biggest rival is Paysandu, with whom he plays the \"Clássico Rei da Amazônia\" (Amazon King derby) or \"Re-Pa\", the largest in the northern region of Brazil. The first game took place on 14 June 1914, with Remo winning 2–1. The Periçá's Club has the most wins in the derby. Between 1993 and 1997, Remo applied a historical taboo on the rival. There were 33 matches (21 wins and 12 draws) in 4 years, 5 months and 24 days.\n\nAnother rival is Tuna Luso, where they both make the second most important derby of Pará. The first match happened on 15 November 1931. It was a friendly that ended tied at 0–0.\n\nRemo's stadium is Evandro Almeida (Baenão), which has a maximum capacity of 17,250 people. The stadium is named after Evandro Almeida, who was a Remo's football player and employee.

{"id": "1832368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832368", "title": "Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal", "text": "Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal\n\nThe Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal is an objection to the Doomsday argument (that there is only a 5% chance of more than twenty times the historic number of humans ever being born) by arguing that the chance of being born is not one, but is an increasing function of the number of people who will be born.\n\nThis objection to the Doomsday Argument (DA), originally by Dennis Dieks (1992), developed by Bartha & Hitchcock (1999), and expanded by Ken Olum (2001), is that the possibility of you existing at all depends on how many humans will ever exist (\"N\"). If \"N\" is big, then the chance of you existing is higher than if only a few humans will ever exist. Since you do indeed exist, this is evidence that \"N\" is high. The argument is sometimes expressed in an alternative way by having the posterior marginal distribution of \"n\" based on \"N\" without explicitly invoking a non-zero chance of existing. The Bayesian inference mathematics are identical.\n\nThe current name for this attack within the (very active) DA community is the \"Self-Indication Assumption\" (SIA), proposed by one of its opponents, the DA-advocate Nick Bostrom. His (2000) definition reads:\n\nA development of Dieks's original paper by Kopf, Krtous and Page (1994), showed that the SIA precisely cancels out the effect of the Doomsday Argument, and therefore, one's birth position (\"n\") gives no information about the total number of humans that will exist (\"N\"). This conclusion of SIA is uncontroversial with modern DA-proponents, who instead question the validity of the assumption itself, \"not the conclusion\" which would follow, if the SIA were true.\n\nThe SIA-mathematics considers the chance of being the\" n\"th human as being conditioned on the joint probability of two separate events, both of which must be true:\nThis means that the pdf for \"n\", is concentrated at P(\"n\" = 0) = 1 - P(\"b\"), and that for P(\"n\" > 0) the marginal distribution can be calculated from the conditional:\n\nJ. Richard Gott's DA could be formulated similarly up to this point, where it has P(\"b\" | \"N\") = P(\"b\") = 1, producing Gott's inference of n from N. However, Dennis Dieks argues that P(\"b\") < 1, and that P(\"b\" | \"N\") rises proportionally in \"N\" (which is a SIA). This can be expressed mathematically:\n\nThe SIA’s effect was expressed by Page et al. as Assumption 2 for the prior probability distribution, P(N):\n\nThey note that similar assumptions had been dismissed by Leslie on the grounds that: \"it seems wrong to treat ourselves as if we were once immaterial souls harbouring hopes of becoming embodied, hopes that would have been greater, the greater the number of bodies to be created.\" (1992)\n\nOne argument given for P(\"b\" | \"N\") rising in \"N\" that does not create Leslie’s “immaterial souls” is the possibility of being born into any of a large number of universes within a multiverse. You can only be born into one, so the indifference principle within this (humans-across-universes) reference class would mean that the chance of being born into a particular universe is proportional to its weight in humans, \"N\". (Echoing the weak anthropic principle.)\n\nWhatever the reasoning, the essential idea of the Self-Indication Assumption is that the prior probability of birth into this universe is rising in \"N\", and is generally considered to be proportional to \"N\". (The following discussion assumes they are proportional so P(\"b\" | \"N\") = 2 P(\"b\" | 2\"N\"), since other functions increasing in \"N\" produce similar results.)\nTherefore:\n\nTo clarify the exposition, Gott’s vague prior \"N\" distribution is ‘capped’ at some “universal carrying capacity”, formula_4. (This prevents \"N\"’s distribution being an improper prior.)\n\nformula_4 is the largest possible value for \"N\" if all living space in the 'universe' is consumed. The formula_4 limit has no specified upper bounds (to habitable planets in the Galaxy, say) but makes \"N\"’s posterior distribution more tractable:\n\nThe formula_8 factor normalizes the \"N\"’s probability, allowing calculation of the marginal P(\"n\" > 0) by integration of P(\"b\"|\"N\") across the [1, formula_4] range of possible N:\n\nThis range starts at \"n\" rather than 1, because \"n\" can’t be greater than \"N\". It uses the calculation above for \"n\"’s distribution given \"N\", and implies:\n\nSubstituting these marginals into the conditional equation (assuming \"N\" below formula_4) gives:\n\nThe chance of doomsday before an factor of the current population, \"x\", is born can be inferred, by integrating the chance of \"N\" having any value above \"xn\". (Normally \"x\" = 20.)\n\nTherefore, given the posterior information that we \"have\" been born and that we are \"n\"th in line: For any factor, \"x\" « (formula_4 / \"n\"), of the current population:\n\nThe finite formula_4 is essential to this solution in order to produce finite integrals. In a bounded universe, formula_4 actually must be finite, although this is not usually an argument used by those proposing the SIA rebuttal. However, other proponents of indefinite survival of human (and posthuman) intelligence have postulated a finite endpoint, as the (extremely high) “Omega”.\n\nSpecifying any finite upper limit, formula_4, was not a part of Dieks's argument, and critics of the SIA have argued that an infinite upper bound on \"N\" creates an Improper integral (or summation) in the bayesian inference on \"N\", which is a challenge to the logic of the critique. (For example Eastmond, and Bostrom, who argues that if the SIA cannot rule out an infinite number of potential humans, it is fatally flawed.)\n\nThe unbounded vague prior is scale invariant, in that the mean is arbitrary. Therefore no finite value can be selected with more than a 50% chance of being above \"N\" (the marginal distribution of \"N\"). Olum's critique depends on such a limit existing; without this his critique is technically not applicable. Therefore it must be cautioned that the simplification here (to bound \"N\"'s distribution at formula_4) omits a significant hurdle to the credibility of the \"Self-Indication Assumption Doomsday argument rebuttal\".\n\nMany people, (such as Bostrom) believe the leading candidate for Doomsday argument refutation is a Self-Indication Assumption of some kind. It is popular partly because it is a purely Bayesian argument which accepts some of the DA's premises (such as the Indifference and Copernican principles). Other observations:\n\n\nUnder the Self-Indication Assumption the 'reference class' of which we are part includes a potentially vast number of the unborn (at least into this universe). In order to overturn the conventional DA calculation so completely the reservoir of souls (potential births) in the reference class must be astoundingly large. For instance, the certain-birth DA estimates the chance of reaching the trillionth (formula_21th) birth at around 5%; to shift this probability above 90% the SIA requires a potential number of humans (formula_4) in the order of formula_23 (a septillion births). This might be feasible physically, and is also possible within the conventional DA model (though staggeringly unlikely). However, the SIA differs from the normal DA in having the reference class include all septillion unborn potential-humans at \"this\" point in history, when only sixty billion have been born. Including unborn people in the reference class we sample from means including in the reference class \"things for which we can never have any evidence\". This puts the SIA at odds with philosophical approaches requiring strictly falsifiable constructs, such as Logical positivism.\n\nIt can be hard to visualize how the Self-Indication Assumption changes the distribution because everyday cases where a null result can be returned don't change the statistics significantly. The following two examples of estimating the size of a darkened space show how the probability shift can occur:\n\nThe Bayesian inference shifts from the cloak-room case to the lost-property case, because of the chance \"that the coat would not be found\" in the aisle it was found in, and some estimate of the aisle's dimensions. Using the SIA Bayesian inference equation with formula_4 = 100, n = 1, x = 20 gives the chance that the aisle is above 20 feet long in the Lost-property case:\n\nThe confidence that the unseen space is longer than 20 feet is directly analogous to the confidence that the human race will become more than 20 times as numerous as it has been. Using an formula_4 of one hundred times the current value only increases the subjective chance seven times (from 5% to 35%), but this is a very small limit for the purposes of exposition.\n\nThe SIA is not an assumption or axiom of Dieks' system. In fact, as stated, the negation of the SIA is a theorem of Dieks' system. A proposition similar to the SIA can be derived from Dieks' system, but it is necessary to revise the SIA to limit it to situations where you don't know the date or your birth order number. Even this related proposition is not an axiom of Dieks. It is a theorem, derived from other fundamental assumptions. In Dieks, you may never have been born and the end of the human race is independent of your birth order number. A proposition related to the SIA, but not the SIA itself, can be derived from these assumptions. Hence, no one assumes the SIA. It should be called the Self-Indication Corollary, perhaps.\n\nKatja Grace argues that while SIA overcomes the standard doomsday argument, when combined with an assumption of a Great Filter, SIA leads to another kind of doomsday prediction. The reasoning is as follows. In some worlds, the filter may be early—some time before the advent of a technological civilization like ours. In other worlds, the filter may be late—between the advent of technological civilization and galactic colonization. Collectively, the worlds with mostly late filters have many more instances of life at the human level of development, so SIA, together with the knowledge that we are at the human-level stage, implies we're probably in one of the worlds with a late filter. In other words, the risk of extinction is higher than we would have naively supposed.\n\n"}

Love has sold over 20 million records as a member and the lead singer of Simon Cowell's boy band Five. In 2003, Love released his debut solo album \"Abstract Theory\", which earned him a further three top ten hits. After years out of the spotlight, Love returned to screens on ITV2's \"The Big Reunion\" in 2012. In 2013 he appeared on \"All Star Mr & Mrs\" and became the runner-up for Channel 5's \"Celebrity Big Brother 12\". In 2015, Love starred in BBC Two's documentary series \"Country Strife: Abz on the Farm\", followed by a Christmas special titled \"Country Strife: Abz on the Christmas Farm\". In January 2016, Abz released his first solo single in over a decade, a comedy track called \"Cockadoodledoo\" with the hope of raising money for his farming project.\n\nOn 29 June 1979, Love was born in London to Turkish father Turan Sanveren and Irish mother Kathleen Breen. Love was raised on a council estate in Hackney, East London until he left home at 16 to join boyband Five. He won a scholarship to attend the Italia Conti Stage School where he studied acting, singing and dance. One day his teacher suggested he audition for a boy band that was being put together by Simon Cowell.\n\nAfter performing in front of Cowell and a panel of managers, Love was chosen from over 3,000 auditionees to be in the band Five (also known as 5ive), which went on to have massive international success winning a Brit Award for Best Pop Act 2000, an MTV award and ASCAP awards for songwriting. Love and fellow 5ive members Jason \"J\" Brown and Sean Conlon were heavily involved in writing many of the band's greatest hits such as \"Everybody Get Up\", \"Keep On Movin'\" and \"If Ya Gettin' Down\".\n\nFive (stylized as 5ive) were a successful British boy band in the '90s consisting of members Richard Abidin Love (Abz), Jason Brown ('J), Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, and Scott Robinson. Formed in 1997 by father/son management team Bob Herbert and Chris Herbert for Safe management ltd. (The same team that originally formed the Spice Girls ) The band went on to be signed by music industry boss & A&R Simon Cowell (at the time Cowell was a music executive at Sony BMG).\n\nBased on current BPI certifications 5ive have sold an over 1.6 million albums and 2 million singles in the UK alone. The band split up on 27 September 2001 when new father Robinson convinced the other members to take a break. Love has since stated on ITV's \"The Big Reunion\" that he \"did not want the band to split and wanted to continue\", saying \"It felt like they were taking something away from me\".\n\nAfter Five split, Love was signed to Sony BMG by Simon Cowell as a solo artist and became the only band member to release a solo album. \"Abstract Theory\" had three Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart with \"What You Got\" (UK no. 4), \"Stop Sign\" (UK no. 10) and \"Miss Perfect\" (UK no. 5). Plans for \"7 Ways\" as the fourth single were aborted despite a music video shot for it. The solo album stalled at number 29 in the UK Albums Chart, leading him to be dropped by Sony in December 2003.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, it was revealed via Twitter that Five would be taking part in an ITV2 documentary series called \"The Big Reunion\", which also featured Atomic Kitten, Blue, 911, Honeyz, B*witched and Liberty X and followed their journey as they prepared for a comeback show at Hammersmith Apollo. \"The Big Reunion\" aired in January 2013 and was an unexpected hit for ITV2, with each episode averaging 1 million viewers.\n\nThe show revealed what had happened to the bands after finding fame, with 5ive's stories, both as a band and as individuals, heavily featured on the show. Viewers quickly fell in love with Love's quirky sense of humour and ruthlessly hilarious honesty. In episode 4 he gave the audience a tour of his vegetable garden and showed off his 'curly carrots' which subsequently trended at No. 8 on Twitter. Love's eccentric choices of headwear garnered him attention from fans, with his favourite 'rainbow unicorn hat' selling out within days on eBay.\n\nLove entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on 22 August 2013. When asked by CBB presenter Emma Willis why he was doing the show he responded, \"I need a home cos I'm currently living with my aunty Wendy\". While Love has never confirmed how much he was paid to do the show, it has been speculated that he was offered a £100,000 fee.\n\nWhilst in the house, he struggled to socialize and integrate with his fellow housemates. Love made headlines around the world when he confessed in the diary room that he suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a neurological condition that can cause the sufferer social anxiety and affect speech and communication.\n\nOn 13 September, Love was announced as the CBB12 runner-up, behind Charlotte Crosby.\n\nIn August 2014 Love announced via Twitter that he had left Five, stating: \"As of today I am no longer a member of 5ive, thank you to all the fans who supported. I love you all\".\n\nNatasha Hamilton of Atomic Kitten quickly took to Twitter to criticize Love, stating: \"@abzlove has left @official5ive via the world of twitter...I'd be gutted if one of the girls did that. Publicity stunt if you ask me!\"\n\nIn an interview with reveal mag in October 2014 shortly after his departure, Neville made his feelings about Love's exit clear stating \"I'm more than happy to be a three-piece. It's never felt better to be in 5ive. To be honest, five people just get in your way, do you know what I mean? You've got a bit more space to move around now.\"\n\nIn a frank and brutal interview with Auspop magazine, Love stated that member J Brown ('J') changed his mind at the last minute and without the full original lineup Love felt the reunion was tainted. Love claims he attempted to convince his bandmates and their manager to contact Brown and make amends but they refused.\n\nHe states in the interview: \"If we were making a cake, J would be the eggs,\" he muses. \"He's an essential part of the ingredients and so with him missing, the cake never rose. It just kind of stayed flat and not properly cooked. There were a few raisins in it and I don’t like raisins so I had to take them out. You get what I'm trying to say with that analogy? There was no cherry icing on the top. It was just a shitty cake and that’s all it’s been since.\"\n\nLove has admitted that while money was an issue for him it wasn't his only reason for reuniting \"I've been accused of only reuniting with Five for the money but that's rubbish, I could've kept on touring with them cos it was good regular money, but I chose to walk away cos I wasn't happy and I had to follow my heart. It's a shame for the fans, but I tried my best.\" Since Love's exit, his former bandmates continue to tour nightclubs performing as a three-piece still called 5ive\n\nAfter a brief attempt at rural living in Lincolnshire from 2011 to 2013, Love decided to buy a smallholding in rural Wales with his partner. After seeing his hilarious antics during their first attempt his partner and manager Vicky Fallon felt that his transition to fully fledged farmer would make for entertaining viewing so she contacted executive producer and owner of Norfolk-based production company Tin Can Island, Andrea Cornes. Cornes got the project straight away and presented the project to Tom Mcdonald at BBC2 who commissioned the project.\n\nThe BBC cameras followed the couple's journey throughout 2014 as they purchased a dilapidated smallholding and navigated the highs and lows of adjusting to rural life on a budget and the docu-series \"Country Strife: Abz on the Farm\" aired on BBC Two in August 2015. BBC Two were taking a huge risk in introducing Love to their audience and were criticised for it by some, but Love's trademark analogies and clueless antics hilarious on the show soon became a cult hit with viewers and critics alike.\n\nOn 8 September 2015, Love put his Brit Award for best pop act 2000 on eBay. The morning the auction went live he announced his plans on \"The Wright Stuff\" explaining that he hoped to raise some funds for 'topsoil and some gardening tools' for the farm. The bidding started at 99p and Abz constructed a tongue in cheek item description to go with the award. News of the auction quickly spread around the world reaching as far as Asia and Australia.\n\nThe high level of media interest in the auction resulted in bids rapidly rising, eventually reaching over £1 million. Love was reportedly made several offers to end the auction early (including a Ferrari sports car), but turned them down believing that the 1 million bid was real. The day before the auction ended eBay's fraud squad cancelled the account denying him the chance to see if the top bid was genuine.\n\nLove dated singer/songwriter Vicky Fallon starting in 2009 and the couple were subsequently engaged. They split in 2017. In October 2014 Love bought a dilapidated smallholding in Carmarthenshire, Wales.\n\n"}

Jensen began his training in goldsmithing at the age of 14 in Copenhagen. His apprenticeship with the firm Guldsmed Andersen, ended in 1884, and this freed young Georg to follow his artistic interests.\n\nFrom childhood, Jensen had longed to be a sculptor and he now pursued this course of study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1892 and began exhibiting his work. Although his clay sculpture was well received, making a living as a fine artist proved difficult and he turned his hand to the applied arts. First as a modeller at the Bing & Grøndahl porcelain factory and, beginning in 1898, with a small pottery workshop he founded in partnership with Christian Petersen. Again the work was well received, but sales were not strong enough to support Jensen, by this point a widower, and his two small sons.\n\nIn 1901, Jensen abandoned ceramics and began again as a silversmith and designer with the master, Mogens Ballin. This led Jensen to make a landmark decision, when in 1904, he risked what small capital he had and opened his own little silversmithy at 36 Bredgade in Copenhagen.\n\nJensen's training in metalsmithing along with his education in the fine arts allowed him to combine the two disciplines and revive the tradition of the artist craftsman. Soon, the beauty and quality of his Art Nouveau creations caught the eye of the public and his success was assured. The Copenhagen quarters were greatly expanded and before the end of the 1920s, Jensen had opened retail in Berlin (1909), London (1921), and New York (1924)..\n\nJensen made his first piece of jewelry in 1899, a silver and silver and gilt \"Adam and Eve\" belt buckle.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Jensen's work was collected by museums including the Danish Museum for Decorative Art and the Museum Folkwang.\n\nIn 2005 the Bard Graduate Center in New York presented an exhibition entitled, \"\nGeorg Jensen Jewelry\".\n\nWhen he was twenty Georg Jensen signed his first sculpture with \"My Father\" (1887).

{"id": "1832418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832418", "title": "Neurula", "text": "Neurula\n\nA neurula is a vertebrate embryo at the early stage of development in which neurulation occurs. The neurula stage is preceded by the gastrula stage; consequentially, neurulation is preceded by gastrulation. Neurulation marks the beginning of the process of organogenesis.\n\nMice, chicks, and frogs are common experimental models for studying the neurula. Depending on the species, embryos reach the neurula stage at different time points and spend a varying amount of time in this stage. For oviparous organisms, incubation temperature also affects the length of neurulation. In addition to development of the neural tube, other processes occur in a neurula stage embryo depending on the species. For example, in reptiles, extra-embryonic membrane tissues become distinct from the embryo.\n\nThe neurula embryo has five regions of mesoderm that surround the neural tube. Anterior mesoderm develops into the head region, while posterior mesoderm develops into the trunk. Various molecules, including proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, and genes, including Pax transcription factors, are essential for the development and closure of the neural tube in the neurula stage embryo.\n\nNeurulation is a process in vertebrate embryos at the neurula stage in which the neural tube is formed. There are two types of neurulation: primary and secondary neurulation. Primary neurulation refers to the formation and inward folding of the neural plate upon itself to form the neural tube. In secondary neurulation, the neural tube forms via the merging of cavities in the medullary cord. In amphibians and reptiles, primary neurulation forms the whole neural tube, and the neural tube closes simultaneously along its length. Contrarily, in fish, secondary neurulation forms the neural tube. Both primary and secondary neurulation occur in birds and mammals, although with slight differences. Primary neurulation occurs in the cranial and upper spinal regions, which gives rise to the brain and upper regions of the spinal cord. Secondary neurulation occurs in the lower sacral and caudal regions, resulting in the formation of the lower regions of the spinal cord. In birds, the neural tube closes anterior to posterior, while in mammals, the middle closes first, followed by the closure of both ends.\n\nThe point at which the embryo reaches the neurula stage differs among species, while for oviparous organisms, the length of neurulation is additionally affected by incubation temperature. In general, the lower the temperature, the greater the length of neurulation. Chick embryos reach the neurula stage on day 2 post-fertilization, and they undergo neurulation up to day 5. Reptiles, including crocodiles, lizards, and turtles, tend to spend a longer time in the neurula stage. A typical frog embryo, incubated at 18 °C, is an early stage neurula by 50 hours post-fertilization and a late stage neurula by 67 hours. The mouse embryo begins neurulation on day 7.5 of gestation and remains in the neurula stage until day 9.\n\nThe mesoderm of a vertebrate embryo in the neurula stage can be divided into five regions. Ventral to the neural tube is the chordamesoderm. Lateral to either side of the neural tube is the paraxial mesoderm, while the intermediate lateral region to the neural tube is the intermediate mesoderm. The fourth region is the lateral plate mesoderm, and the last region is the head mesenchym. Anterior portions of the mesoderm develop into rostral regions of an organism, such as the head, while posterior mesoderm develops into caudal regions, such as the trunk or tail. The paraxial mesoderm, also termed somitic mesoderm, develops into somites, blocks of tissue that occur in a segmental pattern. Somites, in turn, give rise to vertebrae, ribs, skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, and skin.\n\nIn \"Xenopus laevis\", the transition from the gastrula to the neurula involves morphological changes in two regions surrounding the blastopore: the dorsal involuting marginal zone (IMZ) and the overlying non-involuting marginal zone (NIMZ) of the gastrula. Following involution at the mid-gastrula stage, the IMZ undergoes convergent extension, in which the lateral regions narrow and move towards the midline and the anterior end lengthens. This has the effect of narrowing the blastopore. The NIMZ, which does not involute, simultaneously extends in the opposite direction and at a greater rate to cover regions no longer occupied by the IMZ. The convergent extension of the IMZ and NIMZ begins in the second half of gastrulation and continues into the late neurula stage. Eventually, deep tissue of the IMZ forms the central notochord and the surrounding paraxial mesoderm. By the early neurula stage, the notochord is clearly distinguished. Notochordal cells become arranged in a formation representing a stack of coins in a process termed circumferential intercalation. The superficial layer of the IMZ develops into the roof of the archenteron, or the primitive gut, while the underlying endoderm forms the archenteron floor. The NIMZ develops into a structure resembling the early neural tube. The outer ectodermal layer of the neurula is formed by uniform expansion of the cells at the animal pole, known as the animal cap. The ectoderm then differentiates into neural and epidermal tissue.\n\nIn reptilian embryos, beginning in the late-stage neurula and carrying over into the early stages of organogenesis, extra-embryonic membrane tissues comprising the yolk sac, chorion, and amnion become distinct from the tissues of the embryo. The mesoderm splits to create the extra-embryonic coelom, which consists of two layers. The vascularized mesoderm-endoderm inner layer, termed the splanchnopleure, develops into the yolk sac, while the nonvascularized ectoderm-mesoderm outer layer, termed the somatopleure, becomes the amnion and chorion. During organogenesis, these three extra-embryonic tissues become fully developed. Additionally, within the reptilian neurula, tissues of the brain begin to differentiate and the heart and blood vessels start to form.\n\nMouse neurula tissues divide rapidly, with an average cell cycle lasting 8–10 hours. Proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of neurula-stage cells play an important role in promoting functional cranial neurulation and neural fold elevation; hyaluronic acid (HA) is synthesized and becomes accumulated, while the cell maintains a low level of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). HA is involved in creation of biconvex neural folds, while sulfated GAGs are critical in manipulating the neural groove into a V-shape, as well as in neural tube closure. The ECM does not play a major role in spinal neurulation due to the close-packed nature of the mesodermal cells in the spinal region, which allows little intercellular space. Additionally, actin-containing microfilaments are believed to be necessary in cranial neurulation. They may act as the mechanism for neural folding, or they may stabilize neural folds that have already formed; however, their exact role has not been determined. There is some evidence that growth factors, such as insulin or transferrin, also play a role in neurulation, but this link has not been well-studied.\n\nA variety of genes have been found to be expressed in the neurula stage embryo. Different genes are activated for different neurulation events, such as those occurring in separate regions of the developing neural tube. These genes are necessary for proper neurulation and closure of the neural tube. Signaling molecules such as Wnts, FGFs, and BMFs along with the transcription factors that include Msx, Snails, Sox8/9/10, and Pax3/7 genes play key roles in neural crest formation.\n\nPax transcriptional factors have an important role in early development, especially with regards to the CNS and neural crest. Pax3 and Pax7 are promoters of both neural crest cell survival along with promoting environmental stress resistance. In mouse embryos Pax3 blocks the tumor suppressor gene p53, which is necessary for controlled proliferation and genomic stability, is expressed in all cells of the neurula. During early development Pax3 is expressed at the posterior and lateral area of the neural plate, the same region that the neural crest arises from. Neural crest defects were found to occur in mouse and human Pax3 mutants, indicating an importance of functionality. Within chicks, frogs and fish Pax3/Pax7 are activated by Wnt and FGF signaling. Pax3 and Pax7 are also required for neural crest induction after depletion of the two genes resulted in the lack of activation of the specific neural crest genes Snail2 and Foxd3, which didn't allow further development or emigration of neural crest. Using knockouts has been helpful for understanding the role and functions of several genes found in the neurula. For example, Wnt-1 was found to have no role in the closing of the neural plate, despite being present at the tip of the neural folds when it is closing. Though mutants of Wnt-1 does lead to pattern defects within the brain. Notch1 is involved with formation of somites. HNF-3 is needed for development of the notochord and node. The gene Apolipoprotein B, which is involved in transporting and metabolizing fat soluble molecules in the blood, is expressed in the yolk sac and fetal liver. Within the neurula in \"Xenopus laevis,\" development genes Xwnt-3 and Xwnt-4 are present.\n"}

SBC was created on 1 February 1980 from the former government-owned Radio and Television of Singapore (RTS), which itself was founded on 9 August 1965.\n\nOn 1 October 1994 SBC was privatised, becoming the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS), Radio Corporation of Singapore (RCS) and Singapore Television Twelve (STV12). Upon being bought by Mediacorp, on 12 February 2001, it became Mediacorp.\n\nRadio and Television Singapore (RTS) was converted from a department within the then-Ministry of Culture into a statutory board known as the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) on 1 February 1980. The basis for corporatisation was to free RTS from the administrative and budgetary constraints that had hampered its ability to upgrade broadcasting services to meet the growing expectations of local audiences.\n\nOn 25 July 1982, Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) produced its first local drama for SBC 8. SBC also produced various awarding-winning documentaries and current affairs talk shows but were criticised for their marginalised broadcast of news and current affairs, carrying news that are supporting the common misconceptions that are much silenced.\n\nOn 31 January 1984, SBC launched Singapore's third free-to-air terrestrial television channel, SBC 12 after the government announced its life to nurture a gracious and elegant society. Channel 12 carried mostly art and cultural programmes marking the inception of niche programming.\n\nDue to the lack of proper theatre school at that time, a drama training course was initiated to scout for local Mandarin-speaking talent and ten batches of young artistes were trained Notable graduates of the course include Zeng Huifen, Xiang Yun, Edmund Chen, Terence Cao, Bryan Chan (Chen Guohua), Jimmy Nah (MC King), Pan Lingling, Huang Biren and Cynthia Koh. A training programme for young children and teenagers starring in children's programmes was also started and early trainees included Fann Wong, Bryan Wong and Dennis Chew.

Another surgery for vasectomy reversal is vasoepididymostomy.\n\nVasovasostomy is a form of microsurgery first performed by the Australian Surgeon, Dr. Earl Owen (1934–2014) in 1971.\n\nIn most cases the vas deferens can be reattached but, in many cases, fertility is not achieved.\nThere are several reasons for this, including blockages in the vas deferens, and the presence of autoantibodies which disrupt normal sperm activity. If blockage at the level of the epididymis is suspected, a vasoepididymostomy can be performed.\n\nReturn of sperm to the ejaculate depends greatly on the length of time from the vasectomy and the skill of the surgeon. Generally, the shorter the interval, the higher the chance of success. The likelihood of pregnancy can depend on female partner factors.\n\nOver half of men who have undergone a vasectomy develop anti-sperm antibodies. The effects of anti-sperm antibodies continue to be debated in the medical literature, but there is agreement that antibodies may reduce sperm motility.\n\nOnly two conditions must be satisfied for sperm to be returned to a patient's semen with vasectomy reversal by vasovasostomy. First, the patient must have sperm available to pass through at least one reconnection. The second condition is that each reconnection must be as watertight as possible. The surgeon's goal is to achieve a very precise circumferential reconnection of the sperm canal edges by using meticulously placed microsurgical sutures.\n\nVasovasostomy can be performed in the convoluted or straight portion of the vas deferens.\n\nVasovasostomy is typically an out-patient procedure (patient goes home the same day).\n\nThe procedure is typically performed by urologists. Most urologists specializing in the field of male infertility perform vasovasostomies using an operative microscope for magnification, under general or regional anesthesia.\n\nIf sperm were seen in one or both vas contents at the time of surgery, or sperm reached the patient's semen only transiently after the reversal, microsurgical vasovasostomy may be successful. Unfortunately, surgeons performing only an occasional vasectomy reversal often neglect examining the vas contents for presence or absence of sperm. A surgeon cannot determine sperm presence or absence by the naked eye. The most common cause for failed vasectomy reversals is the inappropriate non-microsurgical technique using sutures that are too large to achieve watertight reconnections. The failure of a competently performed microsurgical vasovasostomy following the absence of any sperm in the contents of each vas usually is due to “blowouts” in the epididymides. Under these circumstances an operation should be performed only by a micro-surgeon with proven vasoepididymostomy expertise, bypassing the blowouts.\n\nThe prognosis for each patient should be determined by a pre-operative examination of the vasectomy sites and consideration of the time interval since vasectomy.\n\nThe rate of pregnancy depends on such factors as the method used for the vasectomy and the length of time that has passed since the vasectomy was performed. The reversal procedures are frequently impermanent, with occlusion of the vas recurring two or more years after the operation.\n\nThe presence of sperm granulomas improves the likelihood of restoring sperm to the semen with a vasovasotomy. A local urologist can easily determine whether you have 0, 1, or 2 sperm granuloma by a painless examination of each vasectomy site. This exam can be fairly inexpensive,\nif you inform their office in advance that this is the only service you wish and you obtain the cost for only this specific examination.\nIf the interval since your vasectomy is less than fifteen years, your prognosis will be 70% or better and this local examination is probably not needed.\nA sperm granuloma develops from post-vasectomy sperm leakage and somehow it behaves like a safety valve preventing internal pressure build up and ruptures of the delicate epididymis tubules with subsequent obstructive scarring.\n\nVasovasostomy can be effective regardless of how long it's been since the original vasectomy. However, if more than 15 years have passed since the original vasectomy, one may have a lower chance of having enough healthy sperm in one's own semen to father a child. Also, the longer the obstructive interval, the more likely it is that a vasoepididymostomy will be required.\n\nTypical cost of one vasovasostomy is US$5,000–15,000 (one side).\n\n\n"}

However it can be applied if there is an integer relationship of frequency, such that the cyclic signals share a repeating sequence of phase angles over consecutive cycles. These integer relationships are called Arnold tongues which follow from bifurcation of the circle map.\n\nOne example of phase synchronization of multiple oscillators can be seen in the behavior of Southeast Asian fireflies. At dusk, the flies begin to flash periodically with random phases and a gaussian distribution of native frequencies. As night falls, the flies, sensitive to one another's behavior, begin to synchronize their flashing. After some time all the fireflies within a given tree (or even larger area) will begin to flash simultaneously in a burst.\n\nThinking of the fireflies as biological oscillators, we can define the phase to be 0° during the flash and +-180° exactly halfway until the next flash. Thus, when they begin to flash in unison, they synchronize in phase.\n\nOne way to keep a local oscillator \"phase synchronized\" with a remote transmitter uses a phase-locked loop.\n\n\n\nA tutorial on calculating Phase locking and Phase synchronization in Matlab.\n"}

Its Mother Church is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in the city of Albany.\n\nInitially the diocese was part of the Archdiocese of New York. It became a diocese in its own right on April 23, 1847.\n\nIn 2016 for the first time in the diocese's history there were more retired than active priest in the diocese, 90 retired verses 85 active. It was estimated that by 2020 there would be only 57 active priest in the diocese.\n\nIn August 2019, numerous sex abuse lawsuits were filed against the Diocese of Albany. Among those accused in the lawsuits is former Albany Bishop Howard Hubbard, who took a leave of absence from active ministry in August 2019 shortly after the lawsuits were made public. In September 2019, the Diocese of Albany created a new position known as \"process manager.\"\n\nIn September 2019, people affiliated with the Diocese's St. Claire's Hospital, which has since closed, sued claiming that the Diocese has been unable to pay their pensions.\n\nBy March 2020, roughly 80 priests who served in the Diocese of Albany were accused of committing acts of sex abuse. During a \"Let's Rebuild Our Church\" event at Siena College, Bishop Scharfenberger hinted a desire to for the Diocese of Albany to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \"We want to do this in a way that is fair,\" Scharfenberger said. \"So that all of those who are entitled to some form of restorative justice or restitution – if we want to use that word – will be able to get a fair share of that.\" On May 8, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo extended the 2019 New York Child Victims Act's statute of limitation deadline to file sex abuse lawsuits from August 14, 2020 to January 14, 2021.\n\nThe following is a list of the Ordinaries (Bishops of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany) and their periods of service.\n\n\n\n\nDuring their terms as bishops of Albany, the first five named were accorded the title \"Right Reverend\" because the American church was still considered a province. From Bishop Gibbons on, they have been entitled \"Most Reverend\". John McCloskey was \"Most Reverend\" after his move to New York, where he later became \"His Eminence\". Six of Albany's deceased Bishops are buried in a crypt beneath the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. John McCloskey is interred beneath St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, and Bishop Broderick is buried in a family plot in Westchester County.\n\nThe cathedral, located on Madison Avenue at Eagle Street in Albany, was completed in 1852 and consecrated by the Most Reverend John Hughes, Archbishop of New York. The first bishop, John McCloskey, was coadjutor bishop of New York with succession rights. This is why he left upon Archbishop Hughes' death in 1865. The Cathedral has a stone exterior. It has the appearance of a stone interior but in fact it is of plaster and lath construction, painted to look like stone. This method was used to save time as McCloskey wanted to get the Cathedral finished in order to prove that the Catholic Church in America was permanent. Originally there was a flat wall at the back of the Cathedral in the area of the Lady window. This window, which depicts scenes in the life of the Virgin Mary, was later moved to the North transept when the semicircular sanctuary was added.\n\nThere is a door in the ceiling of the crypt so that the coffins may be lowered directly into it after the Solemn Requiem of the Bishop. This door, however, was not quite big enough for the ornate, modern coffin that contained Bishop Scully. As a result, those officiating had to remove his body from the coffin, carry it down the stairs, take the coffin apart to feed it through the door and then reassemble it and restore the body. The crypt cannot be seen from above because it is hidden by floor tiles which have to be removed to gain access.\n\nThe Cathedral underwent a US $30M restoration project which started in 2000 with a date of completion being 2009.\n\nTours are offered of the Cathedral.\n\nThe current President of the Diocesan School Board is Carolyn Kelly.\nEnrollment data was obtained from New York State Department of Education Non-Public Enrollment\n\n\nWOPG 1460 AM in Albany; simulcast on WOPG-FM 89.9 in Esperance\n\n\n"}

It travels southeast from downtown Winchester to SR 400 (Washington Street) in downtown Alexandria. Its route largely parallels those of the Washington & Old Dominion Trail (W&OD Trail) and the Potomac River. Between its western terminus and I-395, SR 7 is part of the National Highway System.\n\nSR 7 begins downtown in the independent city of Winchester, as East Piccadilly Street at an intersection with US Route 11 (US 11) and US 522, and it continues through the east end of the city, along North East Lane, National Avenue, and finally Berryville Avenue. SR 7 exits the city into surrounding Frederick County, where its name changes to Berryville Pike and it becomes a four-lane highway. SR 7 continues across Interstate 81 (I-81) and then into Clarke County.\n\nSR 7 enters Clarke County from Frederick County, crossing Opequon Creek, and continues towards the town of Berryville. Business SR 7 (SR 7 Bus.) splits off just west of Berryville and passes through the town, while the main route bypasses the town to the north. Both routes cross US 340, and SR 7 Bus. rejoins SR 7 just east of the town. SR 7 crosses the Shenandoah River and its name changes to the Harry Flood Byrd Highway. SR 7 crosses the Loudoun–Clarke county line and the Appalachian Trail at the summit of Snickers Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nSR 7 enters the rural western part of Loudoun County as the Harry Flood Byrd Highway at Snickers Gap, and then it descends out of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It intersects the northern end of the Snickersville Turnpike, and then it passes just north of the village of Bluemont (formerly Snickersville). Next SR 7 curves just south of Jefferson County, West Virginia.\n\nSR 7 becomes a divided, limited-access highway with a speed limit of just west of the town of Round Hill, where another SR 7 Bus. splits off to serve the towns of Round Hill, Purcellville, and Hamilton, while the main road runs outside of the towns as a bypass. SR 7 Bus. rejoins the main road at the interchange with SR 9 in Paeonian Springs.\n\nSR 7 continues towards the well-developed eastern half of Loudoun County as a four-lane divided highway with some at-grade intersections, and it passes through Clarke's Gap in Catoctin Mountain. Another SR 7 Bus. splits off on the western side of the town of Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun County. The main road continues as the Leesburg Bypass, and merges with the bypass of US 15 around the southern side of Leesburg, while the business route passes through town as Market Street. SR 7 Business intersects with US 15 Business (King Street) by the county courthouse in the center of Leesburg.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has plans to widen the section of SR 7 between SR 9 and East Market Street. However, due to highway budget restrictions, this project was put on hold in June 2008. As of December 2014, construction had begun on the widening of this section of SR 7. In addition to widening Westbound SR 7 from two to three lanes, the median will be modified to limit left turns into and out of Roxbury Hall Road, Leeland Orchard Road, Fort Johnston Road, White Gate Place, and Beechnut Place. In addition to the work on SR 7, roundabouts will be installed at the interchange between SR 7 and SR 9. The southern roundabout will combine the separate intersections of the on and off ramps from SR 7 and Colonial Highway/Dry Mill Road into one.\n\nThe SR 7 bypass crosses the Washington & Old Dominion Trail just before the US 15 bypass splits off from SR 7 in eastern Leesburg, and then SR 7 Bus. rejoins the main highway near the same location. SR 7 continues on through the eastern half of Leesburg, with six lanes. It then crosses Goose Creek, and passes through Ashburn.\n\nSR 7 was rebuilt as a controlled-access highway through eastern Loudoun County. To accomplish this, highway interchanges were constructed replacing the ordinary intersections at Belmont Ridge Road, Loudoun County Parkway, Riverside Parkway, and Ashburn Village Boulevard while closing the intersection at Lexington Drive. A new overpass was constructed to carry Sycolin Road across SR 7 in Leesburg, which opened to traffic on August 11, 2014. \n\nAn additional interchange is planned at Battlefield Parkway in Leesburg.\n\nSR 7 passes by numerous housing subdivisions and businesses before it reaches an interchange with SR 28, close to the Fairfax County line in Sterling.\n\nSR 7 is named Leesburg Pike all the way across Fairfax County, where it is mainly a suburban route. It enters Fairfax County at the interchange with the Fairfax County Parkway (SR 286) and Algonkian Parkway. It continues through Fairfax County, passing by subdivisions and strip malls. It passes through Tysons Corner, where it intersects SR 123 and SR 267, the Dulles Access and Toll Roads. It then intersects the Capital Beltway (I-495) in McLean and intersects I-66 a half mile (0.8 km) west of the West Falls Church Metro station.\nSR 7 then enters the independent city of Falls Church and becomes Broad Street and marks the north/south division for city streets. The road intersects US 29 in the city's center and crosses the W&OD Trail in the city's west end. SR 7 then re-enters Fairfax County as Leesburg Pike and passes through Seven Corners, named for the five roads that intersect, including SR 338 (Hillwood Avenue) and US 50 (Arlington Boulevard), which is grade separated from the rest of the intersection. From there, it travels to Bailey's Crossroads, where it intersects SR 244 (Columbia Pike).\n\nSR 7 enters the City of Alexandria from Fairfax County and briefly forms the border between the Alexandria and Arlington County, and then intersects I- 395. It continues as King Street through Alexandria, passing by T. C. Williams High School, George Washington Masonic National Memorial, Union Station (Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express), and the King Street – Old Town Metro station. SR 7 ends at the intersection of King Street and SR 400 (Washington Street) in Old Town Alexandria, one quarter of a mile (0.4 km) west of the Potomac River.\n\nVDOT is currently working on construction at the intersection of SR 7 and Battlefield Parkway in Loudoun County to construct a new single-point urban interchange. The project will cost $77.3 million and is expected to be completed in Fall 2021. Also as a part of the project: \n\n\nOn August 19, 2019, a third left-turn lane was added from SR 7 west to Baron Cameron Avenue. This was in place of constructing a partial interchange at the intersection, for which SR 7 east lanes would travel under Baron Cameron Avenue; the project was never started, as it was deemed too expensive. \n\nVDOT is currently working on widening SR 7 from four to six lanes and adding shared-use paths along SR 7 between Reston Avenue and Jarrett Valley Drive in Fairfax County. The project is expected to cost $313.9 million and should be completed by mid-2024. \n\nState Route 7 Business (SR 7 Bus.) is a business route in the U.S. state of Virginia. It follows Main Street through downtown Berryville.\nState Route 7 Business (SR 7 Bus.) is a business route in the U.S. state of Virginia. It runs from SR 7 just west of Round Hill to SR 9 just west of Leesburg, where the roadway continues east and south as SR 699. The route provides access from the main route, SR 7, to Purcellville. The route has multiple names along its length including Loudoun Street, Main Street, and Colonial Highway. The route was formed in two segments. The first one was formed in 1980, and the second one was formed in 1987.\n\nThe route's western end is at its parent route, SR 7. It then intersects New Cut Road and Main Street, both part of SR 719. It meets SR 7 once again at a diamond interchange. After that, the route meets State Route 287 (SR 287) at a roundabout. The route's eastern end is at State Route 9 (SR 9) (Charles Town Pike), where it goes east and south as SR 699 (Dry Mill Rd.).\n\nThe first segment of the route was commissioned in 1980 between SR 287 and SR 9. The second segment of the route was commissioned in 1987 between SR 287 and SR 7. These segments were both designated along the former alignment of its parent route, SR 7.\nState Route 7 Business (SR 7 Bus.) is a business route in the U.S. state of Virginia. It follows Market Street through downtown Leesburg. In downtown Leesburg, SR 7 Bus. intersects with US 15 Bus.\n"}

Tuscola High School succeeded the original Waynesville Township High School during the 1966 consolidation that merged Fines Creek and Crabtree High Schools with Waynesville. The school was built in the Tuscola community of East Waynesville, near Lake Junaluska and was named after the community in which it was built. Tuscola is a Cherokee word that means \"Digging in Many Places\". The school's mascot is a Mountaineer and the school colors are black and gold.\n\nOn September 30, 1963, the joint boards of education recommended that the schools of Haywood County consolidate. Due to the popular thought that larger schools could provide more opportunities at a more cost-effective price, plans were made to build two senior high schools, one on each side of the county. The construction of these new schools was to be financed by a 2.5 million-dollar bond, along with additional state and local funds. In order to make travel more reasonable for residents of Crabtree and Fines Creek, the location of the high school was moved from West Waynesville to an East Waynesville community near Lake Junaluska known as Tuscola. The name for the new high school became an issue for debate. Some wanted to keep the Waynesville name, while others suggested the name \"Crabcreek\"- after the Crabtree and Fines Creek high schools. However, in the end the school was named Tuscola- after the East Waynesville community in which it was built. The Waynesville school colors of black and gold and the Mountaineer mascot were both inherited by the new school.\n\nTuscola is currently a member of the 3A Western Mountain Conference but has a pending appeal to move to the 2A Mountain Six Conference in 2019.\n\nThe school is best known for its tradition-rich football program - which holds 24 Haywood County Championships, 14 Conference Championships, 1 Western Division II Championship, and 1 NCHSAA State Championship.\n\n\n\n"}

Kobzars accompanied their singing with a musical instrument known as the kobza, bandura, or lira. Their repertoire primarily consisted of para-liturgical psalms and \"kanty\", and also included a unique epic form known as dumas. \n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century there were three regional kobzar schools: Chernihiv, Poltava, and Slobozhan, which were differentiated by repertoire and playing style.\n\nIn Ukraine, kobzars organized themselves into regional guilds or brotherhoods, known as tsekhs. They developed a system of rigorous apprenticeships (usually three years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations in order to become a kobzar. \n\nThese guilds were thought to have been modelled on the Orthodox Church brotherhoods as each guild was associated with a specific church. These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononenko, p. 568–9). The Orthodox Church however was often suspicious of and occasionally even hostile to kobzars.\n\nThe institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the Ukrainian SSR in the mid 1930s during Stalin's radical transformation of rural society which included the liquidation of the kobzars of Ukraine. Kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the bandura.\n\nSoviet kobzars were stylised performers on the bandura created to replace the traditional authentic kobzari who had been wiped out in the 1930s. These performers were often blind and although some actually had contact with the authentic kobzari of the previous generation, many received formal training in the Folk conservatories by trained musicians and played on contemporary chromatic concert factory made instruments. \n\nTheir repertoire was primarily made up of censored versions of traditional kobzar repertoire and focused on stylized works that praised the Soviet system and Soviet heroes. \n\nIn recent times, there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the Kobzar Guild as a centre for the dissemination of historical authentic performance practice.\n\n\"Kobzar\" is also a seminal book of poetry by Taras Shevchenko, the great national poet of Ukraine.\n\nThe term \"kobzar\" has on occasion been used for hurdy-gurdy players in Belarus (where the hurdy-gurdy is often referred to as a \"kobza\", and bagpipe players in Poland where the bagpipe is referred to as a \"kobza\" or \"koza\").\n\n\n\n"}

The balloon theme replaced the computer generated spinning globe which had been used as the main ident on the channel since 1991. It launched on the same day as a BBC-wide rebrand, and thus the new idents also carried the new BBC logo. The channel's name also changed, from BBC1 to BBC One. This was the last ident set used by the channel to be used at closedown; their last closedown took place on 8 November 1997; starting the following day, BBC News 24 would broadcast on BBC One in the late night hours.\n\nThe hot air balloon featured in the idents was filmed on location and also added to scenes by computer generation. It was built by Cameron Balloons in 1997, and made its first flight that year, flying from the Bristol Balloon Fiesta. It made its final flight in August 2002 before being retired and placed into storage. The balloon's flight certificate from the Civil Aviation Authority expired on 17 July 2003.\n\nAs part of a large relaunch of the BBC's corporate logo and the ident packages of BBC's One and Two, these new idents were used to replace the old virtual globe. As a result of the rebrand, which saw the channel name lose all personality, it was proposed by the design agency Lambie-Nairn that the personality be added a different way, namely by making the globe interact in the country and the peoples lives.\n\nThe idea was designed and conceptualised by the Lambie-Nairn design agency in London, with the balloon itself made in Bristol by Cameron Balloons Ltd: its aircraft registration was \"G-IBBC\".\n\nThe look itself featured a predominantly red balloon, with the map of the world picked out in orange with white clouds on top, floating over various scenes of the British landscape. The colours were chosen because a blue balloon with a green map would have been more difficult to see against the land and sea. The size of the balloon was originally proposed to be 100 ft, but was reduced to 60 ft when it was made. The idents featured a soundtrack of ambient music, with more lively versions being used for more industrial or recreational settings. This made them the first regular BBC One idents to actually use music. The new BBC logo, along with the channel name 'ONE' immediately to the right of it, was overlaid at the bottom of the screen. The new logo design was an attempt to unify all of the BBC's services and brands under a single logo design, with personality expressed through the idents themselves. The idents were, from October 1998, shown in Widescreen, and the bbc.co.uk URL was added above the logo soon after.\n\nThe new look also featured a clock, which used the same software and layout as before, and used the balloon canvas as the background. The clock was also retained following the change to widescreen, however the software was changed so that the minute hand, instead of moving every second as it had previously, only moved once a minute.\n\nPromotions and static captions both featured text and logos centred for Widescreen use, with the BBC One logo at the bottom of the screen and a colour palette of mainly oranges and reds, however colours varied according to theme and programme. The use of static captions was reduced slightly, but still remained a key part of continuity links.\n\nThe original sequences were filmed over six weeks in June and July 1997 at eleven locations around the United Kingdom. From these eleven locations, forty-seven different 35-second films were produced featuring the balloon floating serenely over British landscapes. Much of the photography was from a helicopter at heights of up to 3,500 ft. One noticeable and intentional aspect about the original balloon films was that none of the sequences featured people or any distinct human activity. The locations were:\n\n\nA year after launch in 1998, several more idents were created and added to the collection. The main difference between these new additions and the originals was that people were now included in the sequences. However, the balloon itself was inserted digitally by computer on to pre-filmed locations and did not actually fly over the following locations:\n\nIn 2000, the BBC wanted the balloon idents to become more inclusive, so they introduced the 'lifestyle' idents. These featured skateboarders, a busy market scene, a bungee jumper and a carnival, all of which featured the balloon flying past in the background.\n\nThere were also many special idents made for new programmes, sporting events or, most notably, the Christmas holiday. These included:\n\nIn 2001, Lorraine Heggessey became controller of BBC One and immediately ordered a review of the channel's branding. In her opinion the balloon was \"slow and distant\" and so, in 2002, after much speculation, the balloon idents were replaced as the icon of BBC One with a set of idents with the theme of Rhythm & Movement, making it the final motif of the globe logo for the channel after 39 years. English 12 was the final ident aired before BBC News 24 at 2.15am in the early hours of 29 March 2002. \n\nThe balloon itself last took to the skies in the summer of 2002 when it took part in the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. It is now wrapped up and held in a museum by a preservation society.\n\nThe idents were well received by viewers and hold a loyal fan base even up to this day.\n\nThe balloon idents were also shown on BBC America between 1999 and 2003, and lasted several months after it had been retired by BBC One. Unlike BBC One, BBC America employed shorter, snappier cuts of various balloon sequences with slight changes to the familiar musical score.\n\n\n"}

Parker (1827 – January 30, 1900) was an American abolitionist, inventor, iron moulder and industrialist. Parker, who was African American, helped hundreds of slaves to freedom in the Underground Railroad resistance movement based in Ripley, Ohio. He saved and rescued fugitive slaves for nearly fifteen years. He was one of the few black people to patent an invention before 1900. His house in Ripley has been designated a National Historic Landmark and restored.\n\nParker was born in Norfolk, Virginia 1827. He was the son of a slave mother and white father. Born into slavery under the principle of \"partus sequitur ventrem\", at the age of eight John was forced to walk to Richmond, where he was sold at the slave market to a physician from Mobile, Alabama.\n\nWhile working at the doctor's house as a domestic servant, John was taught to read and write by the doctor's family, although the law forbade slaves' being educated. During his apprenticeship in a foundry, John attempted escape to New Orleans by riverboat and had conflicts with officials. He asked one of the doctor's patients, a widow, to purchase him. After taking title to him, she allowed him to hire out to earn money, and he purchased his freedom from her for $1,800 in 1845. He earned the money through his work in two of Mobile's iron foundries and occasional odd jobs.\n\nParker left the South, first settling in Jeffersonville, Indiana, then Cincinnati, Ohio, where there were larger free black communities and jobs in the bustling port. There in 1848 he married Miranda Boulden, free born in the city. They moved to Ripley, a growing center of abolitionist activity, and had six children together:\n\nThe parents ensured that all their children were educated. Two generations from slavery, all six went to college and entered the middle class.\n\nIn Ripley, Parker joined the resistance movement, known as the Underground Railroad, whose members aided slaves escaping across the river from Kentucky to get further North to freedom; some chose to go to Canada. He guided hundreds of slaves along their way, continuing despite a $1,000 bounty placed on his head by slaveholders. The federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the penalties for such activism. Parker risked his own freedom every time he went to Kentucky to help slaves to escape. During the Civil War, he recruited a few hundred slaves for the Union Army.\n\nThe historian Stuart Seely Sprague has researched much information about Parker and his life. Beginning as an iron moulder, Parker developed and patented a number of mechanical and industrial inventions, including the John P. Parker tobacco press and harrow (or pulverizer), patented in 1884 and 1885. He had invented the pulverizer while still a young man in Mobile in the 1840s. Parker was one of the few blacks to patent an invention before 1900.\n\nIn 1865 with a partner, he bought a foundry company, which they called the Ripley Foundry and Machine Company. Parker managed the company, which manufactured engines, Dorsey's patent reaper and mower, and sugar mill. In 1876 he brought in a partner to manufacture threshers, and the company became Belchamber and Parker. Although they dissolved the partnership two years later, Parker continued to grow his business, adding a blacksmith shop and machine shop. In 1890, after a destructive fire at his first facility, Parker built the Phoenix Foundry. It was the largest between Cincinnati and Portsmouth, Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ballad was released as the album's fourth single in the second quarter of 1991. It became another U.S. number one single for Carey. Like the previous singles released from \"Mariah Carey\", the song received a BMI Pop Award.\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Cry\" is a soulful R&B slow jam featuring acoustic guitars.\n\nIts lyrics talk about Carey and her lover being involved in a tumultuous relationship. It was Carey's first single that she did not co-write with Ben Margulies. When she and Walden first wrote the song, she was excited because it sounded like something that would be played on the radio. However, due to bad experiences during its production and because she feels it \"doesn't have a message,\" Carey stated in an MTV interview that she dislikes the song and tries to sing it as rarely as possible. Carey had lobbied to co-produce the song, but was denied permission by Columbia Records. She often fought with Walden in the studio concerning the song's production, and as a result Walden became her least favorite among the producers who worked on her debut album. Due to this, Carey had not performed the song since her 1996 Daydream World Tour; though it was reinstated in 2015 for her \"#1 to Infinity\" concert residency in Las Vegas.\n\nAllMusic editor Ashely S. Battel highlighted this song on Carey's self-titled album. Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" described it as a \"dramatic pop ballad\" and noted that producer Walden's \"grand production suits her acrobatic vocal style.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it as a \"weeper\" and a \"rallying cry for the love-starved and lonely.\" While comparing Carey's \"Emotions\" album to her debut album, Rob Tannenbaum of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"'I Don't Wanna Cry' was the best track on Carey's debut because her downcast whispers animated the song's luxurious sorrow; at full speed her range is so superhuman that each excessive note erodes the believability of the lyric she is singing.\"\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Cry\" became Carey's fourth number 1 hit on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making her only the second act (and first female and first solo artist) after The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles reach number 1 on the Hot 100. It also made \"Mariah Carey\" a record-breaking album: every single released from it was a chart-topper in the U.S. \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" reached number 1 in its eighth week and spent two weeks at the top, from May 19 to June 1, 1991. It replaced \"I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)\" by Hi-Five, and was replaced by Extreme's \"More Than Words.\" The single became Carey's third number 1 single on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It remained in the top 40 on the Hot 100 for 13 weeks and was one of four Carey singles on the chart's 1991 year-end chart, ranking 26. The song also hit number 7 in Canada and number 49 in Australia but failed to chart elsewhere.\n\nThe single's music video, directed by Larry Jordan, features Carey in a dark Midwest home with an attractive man and in maize, brooding over their tainted relationship.\n\nPart of an alternative version of the music video was released on the DVD/home video \"The First Vision\" (1991), and the original, more familiar version was included on the DVD/home video \"#1's\" (1999) as a director's cut, being the only video from Carey's debut album to be included on \"#1's\". The 1991 version had a few sepia-toned sequences that were eliminated and replaced for the DVD release. According to Carey, the sepia sequences were shot and inserted after the original video shoot had taken place, as Sony executives complained about her dress blowing up and the attractive man being a distracting element. Carey said that the added sequences were not a good look for her, and that she prefers the original director's cut.\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Cry\" was released as a single on iTunes from Jason Castro on \"American Idol\", for which he performed the song on the show's seventh season.\n\nUS Promo CD\n\nUS Cassette Single\n\nAustralian 7\" Single\n\nJapanese CD Mini-Single\nAustria Promo CD\n\n"}

Composed of two outbreaks, the sequence first began with a tornado outbreak that commenced in Mississippi early on March 21. Several significant tornadoes occurred, one of which killed seven people in one family and another destroyed much of Lower Peach Tree, Alabama, with 27 deaths all in that town. The tornado at Lower Peach Tree is estimated to have been equivalent to a violent F4 tornado on the Fujita scale, based upon damage accounts. The tornadoes occurred between 0630–1030 UTC, or pre-dawn local time, perhaps accounting for the high number of fatalities—a common trend in tornadoes in the Dixie Alley. In all, tornadoes in Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama killed 48 people, perhaps more, that day and injured at least 150 people.\n\nMarch 23, Easter Sunday, was the most violent tornado outbreak to affect the northern Great Plains on so early a date in the year—a record that still stands as of 2020. That day, four F4 tornadoes affected portions of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, killing at least 168 people. The deadliest tornado of the day was a potent F4 tornado that grew to in width as it passed through northern Omaha, Nebraska, killing at least 94 people in the city proper and three in rural areas. Damage in Omaha reached at least F4, possibly even F5, intensity, though confirmation of F5 damage could not be determined from available evidence. The tornado is the 13th deadliest ever to affect the United States and the deadliest to hit the U.S. state of Nebraska as of 2014. No other violent tornado would affect Omaha for another 62 years. Outside the Great Plains, the outbreak of March 23 also produced two other F4 tornadoes, one each in Missouri and Indiana, including a devastating path more than through southern Terre Haute, Indiana, killing 21 people and injuring 250.\n\nIn all, the two consecutive outbreaks killed at least 241 people and caused at least 19 tornadoes, though only significant events were recorded and other, weaker tornadoes may have gone undetected. The outbreak sequence also produced seven violent tornadoes, nearly half the documented total of tornadoes for the sequence. Tornadoes struck Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana. At least $9.68 million in damages were reported.\n\nA series of potent storm systems traversed the US during March 1913, described by the US Weather Bureau as \"...the most extraordinary situation in regards to the weather since the creation of the bureau.\" Anomalously high moisture had gathered near the US Gulf Coast, as an intense upper level storm system moved in from the west. According to retrospective numerical modeling of this event, a strong cap aloft was in place over the central Plains, as is common as the elevated mixed layer advects eastward from the Rockies. Observations taken at 13Z 23 March 1913 showed that surface low pressure was located in Colorado, and a warm front stretched due eastward from there into Illinois. Morning temperatures near this front were in the 30s. South of the front warmer and moister air was present, but dewpoints in the upper 50s were confined to southern Oklahoma and Arkansas, far away from where the tornadoes were to later occur in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.\n\nAs the day progressed, the surface low ejected through Nebraska, with a dry line and trailing cold front. South winds blowing 40-50 knots at times brought the moister air rapidly northward. One of the worst dust storms on record occurred behind the dry line in western Kansas, but in the warm sector the day remained dry until mid afternoon when light showers began to form in central Nebraska. A cooperative observer in Osceola noted that the wind shifted from S to NW at 2230Z (4:30 PM local). Professors at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln noted that the relative humidity there jumped from 53% at 2150Z to 78% at 2230Z, indicating much higher dewpoints had rapidly arrived in Lincoln since the cold front was still to the west near Osceola. They also noted that the surface low passed just to the north of Omaha and was in western Iowa at 01Z 24 March 1913.\n\nWith all of this observed information, it is likely that the quality moisture required to produce convection strong enough for tornadoes arrived just an hour or two before the strong forcing associated with the surface low pressure and attendant frontal systems. At the time of the tornadoes it is estimated that surface temperatures were in the upper 60s, dewpoints were in the upper 50s, and surface winds were southerly around 25-30 knots. Numerical modeling estimates that 500 hPa flow was around 80 knots from the WSW and that CAPE was from 1000–2000 J/kg. These conditions are similar to those found in other tornado outbreaks. Tornadic storms developed from 5:00-6:00 PM local time and while storm motions were to the NE, the prevalence of tornadic storms moved southward with the dryline/cold front intersection, lasting until 8:00 PM local in NW Missouri. A serial derecho then formed and moved across Iowa and Illinois through the nighttime hours, hitting Chicago in the early morning.\n\nThe Omaha Easter Sunday tornado struck Omaha, Nebraska, at approximately 6:00 p.m. on March 23, 1913. The storm's path was reported as being wide and contained multiple vortices.\n\nThe Omaha tornado followed the path of Little Papillion Creek as it entered the city. It moved through the west side of town alongside the Missouri Pacific Railroad, destroying the small workers cottages in the area. The tornado was so strong that steel train cars were later found pierced by pieces of shattered lumber from the demolished homes.\n\nBy the time the tornado reached Dewey Avenue it was five blocks wide. When it reached Farnam Hill, the tornado followed a shallow valley through this upscale neighborhood. The large mansions of Farnam were no match for the winds, and many houses were torn to pieces, along with several in the Gold Coast Historic District including the Joslyn Castle, which sustained considerable damage. Buildings were found chopped in half, pipes and supports dangling into space, such as the Duchesne Academy which was nearly obliterated.\n\nAt North 24th and Lake Streets in the Near North Side neighborhood a large African American crowd was enjoying an Easter Sunday performance when the tornado flattened the building and killed more than two dozen people. Other brick structures in this small commercial district took similar hits, and more people died here than in any other part of Omaha. A streetcar running down North 24th Street in North Omaha encountered the tornado near this area. Thanks to the quick action of operator Ord Hensley in ordering passengers to lie on the floor of the car, everyone survived. Later, photographers would spot the wrecked machine and would call it the \"Streetcar of Death\", imagining that no one on board could have survived given the immense damage.\n\nThe F4 tornado skirted the downtown area and moved over the Missouri River into Iowa, causing further damage before dissipating.\n\nIn all, 103 people died, 94 of which were in Omaha, and another 400 were injured. Reportedly, 2,000 homes in Omaha alone were destroyed, with $8 million total damage from the storm, $5.5 million of which was in Omaha (financial damage estimates vary; the NOAA reports more damage than this). In the aftermath of the tornado, a cold front moved into Omaha and caused further misery, as newly homeless residents struggled to escape the snowy weather. Many homes throughout the northern side of the city were leveled, and some were swept away. Photographs at the time showed empty foundations, which possibly indicated F5 damage, but these may have been related to post-tornado clean-up.\nThe same storm system that struck Nebraska created a dust storm in Kansas and hit Missouri with hail and heavy rain. The Omaha tornado marked the beginning of the destruction from storms associated with the Great Flood of 1913. On Monday and Tuesday, March 24 and 25, the storms brought heavy rains to the Midwest and upstate New York, causing widespread flooding.\nRemarkably, operators from the Webster Telephone Exchange Building in Omaha did not leave their stations either during or after the tornado. The building was used as an infirmary for the wounded and dying, with physicians and nurses coming from area hospitals. US Army troops from Fort Omaha set up headquarters in the building, as soldiers patrolled the area for looters and to offer assistance.\n\nInitially, James Dahlman, the longtime mayor of Omaha, refused assistance from any outside sources, including the federal government. However, he relented after seeing the extent of the damage throughout the city. The federal government poured in assistance soon after. The massive damage caused by the tornado inspired new engineering techniques aimed at creating a tornado-proof edifice. The first such building was the First National Bank of Omaha building, built in 1916 at 1603 Farnam Street. The 14-story building was built in a \"U\"-shape.\n\n\n\n"}

All three islands support populations of Humboldt penguins, but are also habitat for several other rare and endangered animal species such as the Peruvian diving petrel or the South American marine otter.

The road is not complete, in the sense of having a gap across the Danube between Călărași and Ostrov. The gap is covered by ferry-boats operated by two private companies every 30–35 minutes during the day and every 45–90 minutes during the night.\n\nWhen designated as a trunk route, in the early 1960s, this was the shortest road between Bucharest and Constanta, as, at that time, there were no road bridges connecting Dobrudja with the rest of Romania (the King Carol I Bridge at Cernavodă being rail only).\n\nAs road bridges over the Danube were constructed, the first one in 1970 at Giurgeni – Vadu Oii, and the second one at Fetești–Cernavodă (Cernavodă Bridge) in the late 1980s, the road lost almost all importance. Currently, the main road connection between Bucharest and Constanta is done via the A2 motorway, opened between 2004 and 2009, while Călărași is served through an exit from the same motorway at Drajna.\n\nCurrently, the route is very sparsely used between Bucharest and Călărași, mainly by commuters between Bucharest and its suburbs of Pantelimon and Brănești, as well as by villagers along its route, as a feeder to A2. Between Ostrov and Constanta, the road provides a vital link between southwestern Dobrudja and the rest of the country. However, as southwestern Dobrudja is sparsely populated, with no notable towns or cities (Ostrov being the biggest, at slightly over 5000 inhabitants), that stretch of the road is sparsely used as well.\nDN3 connects with the Bulgarian road network through a border crossing facility at Ostrov – Silistra (Bulgaria), immediately after the ferry landing. Thus, if counting the Călărași-Ostrov ferry as part of the DN3 road, it can be said that one of the main remaining roles of DN3 is providing a connection between Călărași and Silistra. Note that as of 2009, there is also a direct, newly built Călărași – Silistra ferry, but is far slower (takes almost 2 hours to cross the 8 km distance) and far more infrequent.\n"}

It was first synthesized in 1913 but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s. Under the names Betanamin, Cylert, Tradon, and Ceractiv it was used as a medication to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it is a Schedule IV drug. It is no longer generally available in the United States as a result of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrawing approval of pemoline as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing pemoline for ADHD. This spurred Abbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit.\n\nPemoline is generally considered dopaminergic, but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined. Pemoline passes the blood–brain barrier and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal sympathomimetic side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a nootropic acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting RNA formation in the brain. While drugs like dexamphetamine and methylphenidate are classified as Schedule II, pemoline is listed as Schedule IV (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.\n\nPemoline is Schedule IV Non-Narcotic (Stimulant) controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 and is not subject to annual manufacturing quotas. The salts in use are pemoline magnesium (free base conversion ratio .751), pemoline iron (.578), pemoline copper (.644), pemoline nickel (.578), pemoline rubidium, pemoline calcium, pemoline chromium, and chelates of the above which are identical in weight to the salt mentioned. Pemoline free base and pemoline cobalt, strontium, silver, barium, lithium, sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, and caesium are research chemicals which can be produced in situ for experiments. Others such as lanthanide pemoline salts such as pemoline cerium can be prepared; pemoline beryllium would presumably be toxic.\n\nOther stimulants and MAOI’s are contraindicated with pemoline.\n\nIn some patients pemoline is suspected of causing hepatotoxicity, so the FDA recommended that regular liver tests should be performed on those treated with it. Since receiving FDA approval in 1975, it has been linked with 21 cases of liver failure, of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death. Approximately 1-2% of patients taking the drug show elevated levels of liver transaminase enzymes, a marker for liver toxicity, though serious cases are rare. Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the US and Canada alone during the 25 years it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for indications such as chronic fatigue syndrome and apathy in the elderly (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world), so the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity. There was no clear exposure-toxicity relationship, and no characteristic liver pathology findings. Some patients showed as little as one week between first appearance of jaundice and complete liver failure, and some of the patients that developed liver failure had not showed elevated liver transaminase levels when tested previously. Pemoline (as Betanamin) continues to be available in Japan, where no liver failure cases have been reported associated with its use, however it is only prescribed for the niche indication of narcolepsy, and at a lower dose than previously used in the USA.\n\nIn March 2005 Abbott Laboratories and generic manufacturers withdrew pemoline from the American market due to concerns about the liver toxicity risk.\n\nOverdose of pemoline may present with choreoathetosis symptoms.\n\nPemoline is synthesized by the condensation of racemic ethyl mandelate with guanidine.\n"}
{"id": "1832723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832723", "title": "Marie Christine", "text": "Marie Christine\n\nMarie Christine is a musical with music, lyrics, and book by Michael John LaChiusa. It opened on Broadway in 1999. Set in 1890s New Orleans and then 5 years later in Chicago; the story is loosely based on the Greek play \"Medea\", and uses elements of voodoo rituals and practices. The title character was based in part on the historical figure of Marie Laveau – specifically, her daughter, who took the same name – and the myths surrounding them.\n\nFollowing the success of Michael John LaChiusa's 1993 musical \"Hello Again\", which premiered at Lincoln Center Theater directed by Graciela Daniele, LaChiusa and Daniele decided to develop a new musical work based on a classic text for Audra McDonald. McDonald won her first Tony Award in the acclaimed 1994 Broadway revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Carousel\", produced by Lincoln Center Theater. The musical was workshopped a handful of times through 1996 and in development for three and a half years before its initial staging. \"Marie Christine\" followed \"Parade\" at the Vivian Beaumont- another large, new musical created at LCT and written by a young composer, Jason Robert Brown. Both works shared similar themes and stories of racism, misogyny, and redemption in the American South.\n\nOne of the last new musicals to open in the 20th century, it opened on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater of Lincoln Center Theater on December 2, 1999 in a limited run and closed on January 9, 2000 after 42 performances and 39 previews. Directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, it starred Audra McDonald as Marie Christine, Anthony Crivello as Dante Keyes, Vivian Reed as Marie Christine's voodoo priestess mother, and Mary Testa as Magdalena. While billed initially as a limited run by Lincoln Center Theater, any chance of further extension of the production was severed with the theater's announcement that the musical \"dance play\" \"Contact\" would transfer to the Beaumont from the smaller, Off-Broadway Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in March 2000. \"Contact\" would go on to play 1,010 performances and win the Tony Award for Best Musical in 2000.\n\nThe production was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Book of a Musical (LaChiusa), Best Score (LaChiusa), and Best Leading Actress in a Musical (McDonald). An original Broadway cast album was released by RCA Victor following the show's closing.\n\nColumbia Stages presented the first New York City revival of the piece, opening on March 6, 2013 through March 9 and was staged in a raw space at 3LD Technology and Art Center directed by Raymond Zilberberg.\n\n\nIn New Orleans in 1899, Marie Christine, a racially mixed woman, is in prison without a trial to face death. The prisoners ask her to tell her story (\"Before the Morning\"). Three of the prisoners, acting as a Greek chorus, follow her as she tells of her mother, also named Marie Christine, who was a practitioner of voodoo magic and used it to help people who believed in the craft (\"Mamzell' Marie\"). Her mother warned her that although they know magic, they are still human and can make great mistakes (\"Ton Grandpère est le Soleil (Your Grandfather Is the Sun)\")\n\n\nIn 1894, Marie meets Dante Keyes at Blue Rose Park on Lake Pontchartrain, just outside of New Orleans (\"Beautiful\"). She is instantly drawn to him, although he is a white sea captain who, while charming, is often rude (\"In An Instant\").\n\nMarie tells him of her two brothers, Jean and Paris, who are her caretakers since both her parents are dead. Their mother is held in low esteem in the brothers eyes due to her use of magic, which they disapprove of. Their father was white, and he left their mother and had Paris and Jean work as his servants - due to this they now are quite wealthy. The brothers also care of the dowry left to Marie. Paris and Jean want Marie to marry a man worthy of her, and she feels trapped by them. Jean is having a party later in a month to celebrate his engagement to Beatrice, a woman of class and stature befitting to a man of his stature. Both brothers are leaving for a month to solve other matters. After they leave, Marie confides in her maid, Lisette, that woman can use their wiles to control men if they know how (\"Way Back to Paradise\").\n\nMarie is increasingly enthralled by Dante (\"When You Look At a Man\"), who arrogantly tells of his gifts on the sea (\"The Storm\"). His ship has been taken off course during a storm while delivering fruit, which has spoiled due to the lost time. He is trying to get the money he and his crew are owed, which Marie offers to get for him. She reveals her magic and how, like her mother, she helps those who ask her for her services (\"C'est L'Amour\" / \"To Find a Lover\"). Dante is skeptical of magic, and tells her of his travels (\"Nothing Beats Chicago\"). Marie has never left New Orleans and wishes to explore the world. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Dante reveals the loneliness of life at sea, although when he is on land, he hears the ocean calling to him (\"Ocean Is Different\"). To cover up his inner feelings, Dante tells Marie of his sexual exploits, and as they dance, he seduces her and they make love in the park (\"Danced With a Girl\"). Lisette attempts to find Marie (\"Tout Mi Mi\") and Marie realizes Dante is her way out of her confining life. Her mother appears to warn her of the dangers of giving into her passions (\"Miracles and Mysteries\"). Lisette discovers Marie and Dante together (\"Tout Mi Mi (Reprise)\") and Marie sharply orders her away. Marie invites Dante to live in her guest house while her brothers are away and Dante reveals that he can no longer hear the ocean calling to him as he has fallen in love with Marie (\"I Don't Hear the Ocean\").\n\nA month later, Marie's servants gossip in code about Dante (\"Bird Inside the House\"). Paris and Jean return home and confront Marie about Dante. The town is abuzz with the scandal and they implore her to send him away. She refuses and Paris harshly reminds her of their own father and how he and Jean were forced to be servants at his hand. Paris leaves and alone, Jean makes a plea to Marie (\"All Eyes Look Upon You\"). She agrees and rushes out.\n\nLisette walks in on the servants gossiping about Dante's imminent departure and Marie's newly discovered pregnancy. As the servants leave, Dante corners Lisette and attempts to seduce her (\"Danced With a Girl (Reprise)\"). Marie walks in as Lisette, in an attempt to stop Dante, reveals (in French) Marie's pregnancy. Marie commands Lisette to leave and tells Dante (who, not understanding French, is still in the dark that Marie is carrying his child) that he will take her with him. He initially refutes her, but she reveals that she has the key to Jean's study, where her dowry is kept. He agrees to bring the ship closer and return on the night of Jean's engagement party when they will steal the money and escape to Chicago (\"We're Gonna Go to Chicago\").\nThat night, Marie finds Lisette (\"Never Fall Under the Spell\" / \"Dansez Calinda\") and casts a spell that kills her in revenge. Marie is completely in love with Dante and will do anything for him (\"And You Would Lie\" / \"I Will Give\").\n\nAt the engagement party, Marie and Dante are caught and Paris and Jean beat him. To save Dante, Marie stabs Paris, who dies. Marie and Dante escape to the docks and, as they sail away, Marie wordlessly reveals that she is pregnant (\"Finale of Act I\").\n\n\nMarie and Dante have two boys and sail happily along the Eastern seaboard for five years (\"Opening (Five Years Up and Down the Coast)\" / \"I Will Love You\"). They finally start a home in Chicago. However, Dante, always ambitious, is now more interested in the political world of Chicago. At a brothel run by Magdalena (\"Cincinnati\"), Dante campaigns for Alderman, under the advice of Charles Gates, a political boss (\"You're Looking at the Man\").\n\nDante has left Marie and is engaged to Helena, the daughter of Charles Gates. Dante wants to keep his kids, which Marie refuses to allow. She reminds them of the good times and of his children (\"The Scorpion\"). Dante wants Marie to leave Chicago, telling her that she will be well provided for. Marie has nowhere to go - she has killed her brother and has left her mark in New York due to Dante's gambling. She reveals how she cast a spell on the daughters of the man who cheated Dante and they killed him (\"Lover Bring Me Summer\"). He will not return to her and she reminds him of her enduring love and her magic, which she can use for him or against him (\"Tell Me\"). She will not let him have her children and they part.\n\nMagdalena meets Marie (\"Billy Was Sweet\" / \"There's a Rumor Going Round\") and offers to help her. Marie refuses her, but Magdalena advises her to give up her children now to give her more options. Magdalena can help Marie keep her boys if Marie will help Magdalena conceive a child, which she and her husband have been unable to do (\"Paradise Is Burning Down\"). That night, Marie uses her magic to entangle herself with Dante and Helena - although she is not physically there, they can feel her and they engage in a dangerous mènage-à-tois (\"Prison In a Prison\").\nCharles Gate's workers find Marie at her home and tell her she must leave (\"Better and Best\"). Gates himself soon appears and, using force, convinces Marie to give her boys to him (\"Good Looking Woman\"). Marie is worried her children will end up servants like her brothers and decides to take Magdalena up on her offer (\"You Can Taste the Blood\").\n\nMarie is haunted by her family and Lisette, who tell her she has gone too far (\"No Turning Back\") and cannot return (\"Silver Mimosa\" / \"Before the Morning (Reprise)\"). Marie meets Dante and asks him to allow the boys to give Helena a wedding gift to show how well behaved they are. She reveals she will always love him and that she is doomed to life alone, reliving her past and unable to change it (\"Beautiful (Reprise)\"). The boys will return to her after the wedding to say goodbye before they start their new life with Dante.\n\nMagdalena arrives with the boys and recounts the wedding (\"A Lovely Wedding\"). Marie gives her a gift that will allow her to conceive. Magdalena tells Marie that she has friends that Marie will stay with and, within the month, the boys will be brought to Marie. Before they return to Dante, Marie wishes to bathe her boys. She sings a lullaby to them as she leads them off (\"I Will Love You (Reprise)\"). Dante runs in, revealing that present that Marie had given Helena turned out to be cursed and burned her alive (\"Your Name\"). Marie returns and Dante begs for his boys. He discovers that Marie killed them. Horrified, Magdalena throws Marie's magic gift to the ground and runs away.\n\nBack at the prison, Marie's mother is heard followed by the prisoners, who tell Marie that at her hands, innocence has died; and ultimately asks “but is love too small a pain for a woman?” and dawn arrives. Marie Christine walks towards the cold, rising light, into the burning sun (\"Finale of Act II\").\n\n\nThe Tony-nominated original production was orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick for 17 musicians.\n\n\nThe production received mixed reviews.\n\nBen Brantley wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"When Audra McDonald sings her first notes as the Medea-like heroine of \"Marie Christine,\" Michael John LaChiusa's solemn, sometimes somnolent musical tragedy at Lincoln Center, there is clearly sorcery at work... \"Marie Christine\" ... is a resounding confirmation of Ms. McDonald's status as a vocal artist of singular skills and sensibility... As a musical portrait of an individual, \"Marie Christine\" is stunning; as a compelling, complete production, it still feels oddly unfinished. Despite ravishing orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick, the score rarely achieves much momentum or intensity on its own, and its recurrent motifs don't haunt the imagination as they should.\"\n\nMichael Feingold, reviewing for the \"Village Voice\", wrote: \"Proficient, skilled, and imaginative, LaChiusa marshals an enormous panoply of approaches to tell his tale, but it doesn't hold together, even with the towering talent of Audra McDonald at its center, because the myth won't supply what he needs from it; his constantly shifting strategies only diffuse it further. Though LaChiusa's blurry conception is often conveyed in equally blurry lyrics, his music, with its constant restless invention, probably deserves a fairer hearing than it gets here. More than any new score I've heard recently, it wants unplugging.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1832724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832724", "title": "John Rankin (abolitionist)", "text": "John Rankin (abolitionist)\n\nJohn Rankin (February 5, 1793 – March 18, 1886) was an American Presbyterian minister, educator and abolitionist. Upon moving to Ripley, Ohio, in 1822, he became known as one of Ohio's first and most active \"conductors\" on the Underground Railroad. Prominent pre-Civil War abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Weld, Henry Ward Beecher, and Harriet Beecher Stowe were influenced by Rankin's writings and work in the anti-slavery movement.\n\nWhen Henry Ward Beecher was asked after the end of the Civil War, \"Who abolished slavery?,\" he answered, \"Reverend John Rankin and his sons did.\"\n\nRankin was born at Dandridge, Jefferson County, Tennessee, to Richard and Jane (Steele) Rankin, and raised in a strict Calvinist home. His parents were literate, which was unusual in a remote area. They were staunch Presbyterians, and their children had a religious upbringing. Jane was an unyielding opponent of slavery.\n\nBeginning at the age of eight, John's view of the world and his religious faith were deeply affected by two things — the revivals of the Second Great Awakening that were sweeping through the Appalachian region, and the incipient slave rebellion led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800.\n\nJohn's school had log walls and an earthen floor. He was able to enroll in Washington College, under the direction of Rev. Samuel Doak, an avowed abolitionist; he graduated in 1816. After graduation he was minister of the Abingdon Presbytery, but because his anti-slavery views were not welcome he left Tennessee in 1817, never to return.\nNot a natural public speaker, Rankin worked hard while at Jefferson County Presbyterian Church simply to deliver an effective sermon. Within a few months, however, despite Tennessee's status as a slave state, he summoned the courage to speak against \"all forms of oppression\" and then, specifically, slavery. He was one of the founders of the Tennessee Manumission Society, in 1815. He was shocked when his elders responded by telling him that he should consider leaving Tennessee if he intended ever to oppose slavery from the pulpit again. He knew that his faith would not allow him to keep his views to himself, so he decided in 1817 to move his family to the town of Ripley, across the Ohio River in the free state of Ohio, where he had heard from family members that a number of anti-slavery Virginians had settled.\n\nOn the way north, Rankin stopped to preach at Lexington and Paris, Kentucky, and learned about the need for a minister at Concord Presbyterian Church in Carlisle, Kentucky. The congregation had been involved in anti-slavery activities as far back as 1807, when they and twelve other churches formed the Kentucky Abolition Society, and Rankin's deepening anti-slavery views were nurtured there by his listeners. He remained for four years and started a school for slaves; within a year, however, they were driven first from a schoolhouse to an empty house, and then to his friend's kitchen by club-carrying mobs, and the students finally stopped coming. Spurred by a financial crisis in the area, Rankin decided to complete his family's journey to Ripley. On the night of December 31, 1821 – January 1, 1822, he rowed his family across the icy river. In Ripley he founded a Presbyterian academy for boys, where in 1838 the young Ulysses S. Grant once attended.\n\nIn 1822, Ripley was a town of frequent street fights and shootouts, where the most common type of business was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built, just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother on the topic of slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared at his door at all hours demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a place for him to properly raise his family.\n\nIn 1829, Rankin moved his wife and nine children (of an eventual total of thirteen) to a house at the top of a -high hill that provided a wide view of the village, the River and the Kentucky shoreline, as well as farmland and fruit groves that could provide sources of income. Folklore associated with the Rankin home suggested that a lantern or candle was placed in the front window to guide runaway slaves from across the Ohio River, in Mason County, Kentucky. However, ex-slave narrative recalls a pole with a light. This is a more plausible means of being seen based on the proximity of the house to the river. From there the family could raise a lantern on a flagpole to signal fleeing slaves in Kentucky when it was safe for them to cross into the free state of Ohio. Rankin also constructed a staircase leading up the hill to the house for slaves to climb up to safety on their way further north. For over forty years leading up to the Civil War, many of the slaves who escaped to freedom through Ripley stayed at the family's home. According to him, \"I have \nhad under my roof as many as twelve fugitive slaves at a time, all of whom made good their way to Victoria's dominions [Canada],\" sometimes entire families. It became known as the \"Rankin House\" and is now a US National historic landmark (see photos).\n\nDuring a visit by Rankin to Lane Theological Seminary to see one of his sons, he told Professor Calvin Stowe the story of a woman the Rankins had housed in 1838 after she escaped by crossing the frozen Ohio River with her child in her arms. Stowe's wife (Harriet Beecher Stowe) also heard the account and later modeled the character Eliza in her book \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" after the woman.\n\n\"Brothers of the Borderland,\" a film that depicts Rankin's work in the Underground Railroad in Ripley, is a permanent feature of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, in Cincinnati.\n\nEarly in his time in Ripley, Rankin learned that his brother Thomas, a merchant in Augusta County, Virginia, had purchased slaves. He was provoked to write a series of anti-slavery letters to his brother that were published by the editor of the local Ripley newspaper \"The Castigator\". When the letters were published in book form in 1826 as \"Letters on Slavery\", they provided one of the first clearly articulated anti-slavery views printed west of the Appalachians. Thomas Rankin, convinced by his brother's words, moved to Ohio in 1827 and freed his slaves. By the 1830s, \"Letters on Slavery\" had become standard reading for abolitionists all over the United States. In 1832, William Lloyd Garrison printed them in his anti-slavery newspaper, \"The Liberator\". Garrison later called Rankin his \"anti-slavery father,\" saying that \"his book on slavery was the cause of my entering the anti-slavery conflict.\"\n\nIn 1833 Rankin came to know Theodore Weld through their involvement in the creation of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Weld had come from Connecticut, by way of Oneida County, New York, to attend Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. Rankin attended the debates on slavery organized by Weld at Lane in February of 1834, and published a pamphlet on its consequences.\n\nIn November 1834, at Rankin's Ripley church, Weld began a year-long series of speeches throughout Ohio that raised the profile of the abolitionist movement in the state; at his urging Rankin did likewise. Many local anti-slavery socities were founded.\n\nin April of 1835 an Ohio Anti-slavery Society was formed, at whose initial meeting in Putnam, Ohio (today Zanesville), both Rankin and Weld played key roles.\n\nOn his way home, Rankin had his first real experience with mob opposition to his efforts, as he was showered with rotten eggs. When he stopped in Chillicothe to speak at a church, stones were thrown through a window.\n\nIn 1836, Weld invited Rankin to join a group called \"the Seventy\", who were selected by the American Anti-Slavery Society to travel to churches throughout the Northern states preaching immediate emancipation (\"immediatism\") and forming local anti-slavery societies. Released by his congregation for one year to participate in the effort, Rankin's passion for the cause grew with the opposition to his \"dangerous\" views, even among many who opposed slavery but feared provoking a slave uprising. A bounty of up to $3,000 was placed on his life, and in 1841 he and his sons had to fight off attackers who came to burn his house and barn in the middle of the night.\n\nUlysses S. Grant was a student at Rankin's Presbyterian Academy in Ripley in the fall of 1838. Grant entered the U. S. Military Academy in 1839.\n\nThe passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 heightened the danger and profile of their assistance to runaways as it was now illegal to do so, even in free states. At an anti-slavery society meeting in Highland County, Ohio, held by Rankin and Salmon P. Chase, however, Rankin declared that \"Disobedience to the enactment is obedience to God.\"\n\nOpposition within his own congregation, spurred by Rankin's attempts to expel slaveowners from the church, finally led him to resign in 1846 after 24 years as minister of the Ripley Presbyterian Church. Over one-third of the church's members left with him and helped Rankin establish what eventually came to be the Free Presbyterian Church, which may have had as many as 72 congregations before the coming of the Civil War. After the war, Rankin welcomed the reunion of the Presbyterian churches in Ripley.\n\nIn May 1892, six years after John Rankin's death, a monument aptly named \"Freedom's Heroes\", was dedicated to Rankin and his wife, Jean Lowry Rankin, on the grounds of the Maplewood Cemetery in Ripley, Ohio.\n\nRankin was a 2013 Inductee into the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro, New York.\n\n\nArchival material on Rankin is held by the Ohio Historical Society, Columbus.\n\n\n\n"}

Tesla used it for only one year, until 1900, and it was torn down 1904 to pay his outstanding debts.\n\nThe Experimental Station was located on empty land on the highest local point (Knob Hill) between the 1876 Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and the Union Printers Home, where Tesla conducted the research described in the Colorado Springs Notes, 1899-1900. A few papers of the times listed Tesla's lab as about 200 feet east of the Deaf and Blind School and 200 feet north of Pikes Peak Avenue. This put it on top of the hill at E. Kiowa Street and N. Foote Avenue (facing west), as documented by Pikes Peak Library District.\n\nIn May 1899, Tesla, several of his assistants, and a local contractor commenced the construction of Tesla's laboratory shortly after arriving in Colorado Springs, a high-altitude location where he would have more room than in his downtown New York City laboratory for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments. Tesla moved there to study the conductive nature of low pressure air, part of his research into wireless transmission of electrical power. The lab possessed the largest Tesla coil ever built, in diameter, which was a preliminary version of the magnifying transmitter planned for installation in the Wardenclyffe Tower. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.\n\nHe produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to long. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.\n\nWhile experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in \"The Electrical Experimenter\": \"As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation!\"\n\nDuring his time at his laboratory Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded might be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages \"from another world\" that read \"1 ... 2 ... 3 ...\". Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article \"Talking With Planets\" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.\n\nOn 7 January 1900 Tesla made his final entry in his journal while in Colorado Springs. In 1904 Tesla was sued for unpaid bills in Colorado Springs, his lab was torn down in that year, and its contents were sold two years later in an auction at the court house to satisfy his debts.\n"}

It now encompasses and serves about 32,000 students from grades kindergarten up to 12th grade. CVUSD serves four high schools, five junior high schools, twenty-one elementary schools, one continuation school, an adult school, & one Charter school.\n\n\nAs of February 2020:\nThe CVUSD has always been recognized for its outstanding schools and programs. About half of the schools in the CVUSD have reached the state's API standard of 800.\n\nThe school year begins in August and ends on May every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chino Valley Unified School District Board has been at the center of a number of controversies in recent years regarding issues of the First Amendment. \n\nThe CVUSD Board itself has also faced criticism for multiple years for having public prayers, Bible readings, and Christian proselytizing during its public meetings. The majority of Board members are members of either Calvary Chapel Chino Hills or other similar Christian conservative congregations in the district, and most regularly tout their religious beliefs during Board discussions. Despite numerous letters of complaint from various individuals and groups, the Board has either ignored these complaints or officially rejected to change their practices. The administration actively solicits local Christian pastors to lead Board invocations, and the Board regularly presents recognition awards to religious leaders who provide \"support and prayers for the Chino Valley Unified School District\". \n\nIn July 2010, the CVUSD approved a resolution to introduce \"Bible as Literature and History\" courses at its four high schools, based on a curricula provided by the local Calvary Chapel Chino Hills church and the textbook \"The Bible and its Influence\", written by Christian Evangelical educational political activist Charles Stetson. \n\nOn November 11, 2014, the Freedom From Religion Foundation filed a federal lawsuit against the Board claiming violations of the US and California Constitutions. Although the suit alleged that all of the Board members regularly participated in religious proselytizing, James Na, was singled out as a prime violator of religious neutrality during the meetings, regularly including Christian and Biblical references into many of his official statements. The suit alleges at one recent Board meeting, Na \"urged everyone who does not know Jesus Christ to go and find Him,\" and closed the meeting with a reading of Psalm 143. On February 18, 2016, U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal made a ruling on the FFRF lawsuit, ordering the Board to stop reciting prayers, Bible readings, and proselytizing during school board meetings. On March 4, 2016, the school board voted 3-2 in favor of appealing the ruling.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, the Board changed their policies to explicitly state when board members can and cannot express their faith during meetings. On July 25, 2018, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit unanimously affirmed the District Court's ruling, holding that the \"policy and practice of prayer at Chino Valley Board meetings violates the Establishment Clause.\"\n\nOn March 5, 2009, the Chino Valley Unified School District Board of Education voted 4 to 1 vote to approve a budget reduction plan which included the closure of El Rancho Elementary School and Richard Gird Elementary School, both in Chino, and Los Serranos Elementary School in Chino Hills. Ms. Sylvia Orozco, Board President, Mr. William Klein, Vice President, Mr. Fred Youngblood, Clerk and Mr. James Na, Board member all voted in favor of the budget reduction plan based on the recommendations of the Chino Valley Unified School District Superintendent, Dr. Edmond T. Heatley. Mr. Michael Calta, Board member was the dissenting vote. These three schools were closed at the end of the 2008/2009 school year and their students were reassigned to other schools in the District.\n\nThe process in which these schools were selected to be closed were alleged to violate California Education Code 17387, which states, \"It is the intent of the Legislature to have the community involved before decisions are made about school closure or the use of surplus space, thus avoiding community conflict and assuring building use that is compatible with the community's needs and desires\". Charges were made against the Board of racial / national origin motivations in choosing the schools that they did close.\n\nA complaint was issued with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights regarding the nature and process followed for these school closings. On June 29, 2012, the OCR closed its investigation and released its final report of its findings of the allegations. The report found that, while there were good budgetary reasons for the District to be closing schools at this time, the process used to do so was ad-hoc and disorganized, and appeared to rely principally on the opinions of the District Superintendent with little documentation, public input or transparency. In response, the CVUSD agreed with the OCR's findings and adopted new formal policies for school closure which provided greater transparency and public input into the process.\n\nIn 2006, a member of the school district board was charged with conflict of interest and perjury for allegedly benefiting from a contract between the school district and his employer. He is accused of steering district business to Office Max and failing to accurately report his income at that company in his annual conflict-of-interest statement with the school board.\n"}

When Coronado abandoned his search, Padilla and others followed him to explore what is now the Southwestern United States; Padilla was one of the first Europeans to see the Grand Canyon. But, when Coronado was told by a native named the \"Turk\" that a great land called \"Quivira\" was in modern-day Kansas, Coronado's entire party immediately left in search of it.\n\nAfter reaching the location in 1541, the Spaniards camped alongside a Wichita village for 25 days. Finding no gold, they killed the Turk in fury. Coronado returned to the Southwest and Padilla followed. One year later, the missionary priest returned to Kansas to preach to the Wichita, and establish the first Christian mission in the present-day United States. He was killed in Kansas in 1542 by Native Americans, and is considered to be one of the first Christian martyrs in the U.S.\n\nJuan de Padilla is associated with a miracle known as the \"Rising of the coffin of Padre Padilla\". The story of seeing his coffin rise above the ground was repeated for many years, and was believed by many people in Isleta, where the Padre is believed to be buried. This is not the same Juan de Padilla as the proto-martyr of the United States.\n\nThe first time when the coffin rose, the body was as fresh when he was buried. However, since there are no witnesses to prove this, and he has a missing foot now, it has since becoming New Mexico folklore. \n\nAnton Docher, once a priest in Isleta, investigated the miracle in the presence of several witnesses. He opened the grave of Padre Padilla. During this operation, Docher injured his arm and suffered from the then highly deadly gangrene. Doctors recommended amputation for his survival. The natives inhabitants evoked the intercession of Padre Padilla. Docher made a prayer to Padre Padilla to cure and forgive him for what he did, and supposedly, the wound had disappeared. cf\n\nOn the 1976 \"Leftoverture\" album by the American rock group Kansas, the first movement of \"Magnum Opus\" is entitled \"Father Padilla Meets the Perfect Gnat.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1832761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832761", "title": "Andrew Stanton", "text": "Andrew Stanton\n\nAndrew Stanton (born December 3, 1965) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and voice actor based at Pixar, which he joined in 1990. His film work includes co-writing Pixar's \"A Bug's Life\" (1998) (as co-director), \"Finding Nemo\" (2003) and its sequel \"Finding Dory\" (2016), \"WALL-E\" (2008), and the live-action film, Disney's \"John Carter\" (2012). He also co-wrote all four \"Toy Story\" films (1995-2019) and \"Monsters, Inc.\" (2001).\n\n\"Finding Nemo\" and \"WALL-E\" earned Stanton two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature. He was also nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay, for \"Finding Nemo\", \"WALL-E\", and \"Toy Story\" (1995), and for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for \"Toy Story 3\" (2010). On television, Stanton directed two episodes of \"Stranger Things\" in 2017, an episode of \"Better Call Saul\" in 2018, and the final season premiere of \"Legion\" in 2019.\n\nStanton was born in Rockport, Massachusetts and graduate of Rockport High School (1983). Stanton is a professed Christian.\n\nHe was one of several CalArts graduates hired by John Kricfalusi to work on \"\" at Ralph Bakshi's studio.\n\nHe was hired by Pixar's animation group in January 1990 as its second animator (John Lasseter being the first one) and ninth employee. Back then the company was not yet an animation studio, and their animation group was dedicated to making television commercials as a step towards their goal of making the first computer-animated feature.\n\nHe, Lasseter, Pete Docter and Joe Ranft all came up with the story of \"Toy Story\". After filmmaker Joss Whedon put his touches on an early version of the film's script and left to do another film, Stanton decided to take a crack at scriptwriting. Stanton rewrote every piece of dialogue in the film. The resulting screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay, the first nomination in that category for an animated film. To this day it is considered one of the greatest screenplays ever written for a film. Docter says Stanton related a lot to the character of Woody, whereas he related a lot to the character of Buzz Lightyear. \n\nFollowing \"Toy Story\", Lasseter asked Stanton to help him direct and write Pixar's next feature \"A Bug's Life\". Early in the film's production, the film had difficulty incorporating the circus bug's portion of the story and the main character (Flik's) portion of the story. In a day, Stanton was able to write a screenplay that tied both concepts together. In 1999, Stanton returned to write \"Toy Story 2\", the critically acclaimed sequel to \"Toy Story\", and also voiced Emperor Zurg. He would then go on to write \"Monsters, Inc.\". Docter, the director of \"Monsters, Inc.\", would cite him many times of the originator of the idea that monsters generated screams to use to power their city. \n\nStanton made his sole directorial debut in 2003 with \"Finding Nemo\". He took inspiration from his own role as a father and how he was overprotective of his son. Stanton directed, wrote and voiced Crush the seaturtle in the film. Just like \"Toy Story\" before it, Michael Eisner was not confident in the film and predicted it would fail. During this time Stanton and other \"Finding Nemo\" co-writer Bob Peterson developed the storytelling theory of \"2+2\", to not give the audience the full picture but rather halves and have them put the film together. The film turned out to be an enormous success becoming the highest-grossing film of 2003 and the highest grossing animated film of that time period beating out \"The Lion King\". He won his first Academy Award for the film in the category of Best Animated Feature and his screenplay was nominated in the category of Best Original Screenplay. Following his success with \"Finding Nemo\", Stanton began work on his next film as director \"WALL-E\". \"WALL-E\" was considered a huge risk for both Pixar and Disney, considering how experimental the film sounded. Stanton nevertheless had confidence in the film and the fact that audiences wouldn't be bored by the dialogue-less first thirty minutes, but rather enamored by it. Upon release though the film was a huge critical and financial success. Stanton won his second Academy Award from the film in the category of Best Animated Feature and once again his screenplay was nominated in the category of Best Original Screenplay. In an interview with \"World Magazine\"s Megan Basham, Stanton explained his singular vision for \"WALL-E\": \n\nStanton returned to write \"Toy Story 3\" in 2010, alongside Michael Arndt. When he first pitched the scene of the toys in the incinerator both Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (the director of the film) teared up. Many employees at Pixar have pointed out how the release of the film happened to be somewhat consecutive to one of Stanton's children going to college. His screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay. After the acquisition of Pixar by The Walt Disney Company in 2006, Stanton became the vice president of creativity of Pixar alongside other fellow Pixar director Pete Docter. He is a member of the studio's coveted brain trust and has executive produced and served as a creative and mentor like voice on the following films: \"Ratatouille\", \"Up\", \"Brave\", \"Monsters University\", \"Inside Out\", and \"The Good Dinosaur\". Stanton made his live-action directing debut with Disney's \"John Carter\". The film was based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, \"A Princess of Mars\". Upon release it received mixed reviews and was a box office failure.\n\nFollowing \"John Carter\", Stanton returned to Pixar to direct the sequel to 2003's \"Finding Nemo\", \"Finding Dory\". He came up with the concept upon watching a pre-screening of the 3D rerelease of the film and walking out of the theater worried about Dory. The film was released in 2016 and was a huge hit critically and financially, becoming the highest grossing animated film of that year. It was also critically received well, with critics calling it \"a worthy successor to \"Nemo\"\". On February 10, 2017, it was revealed by \"Entertainment Weekly\" that Stanton was going to direct two episodes of the second season of \"Stranger Things\". Since then Stanton has also directed an episode of \"Better Call Saul\", and \"Legion\".\n\nStanton was credited as a narrative guru on \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\", helping director and former classmate Rich Moore construct the story following Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios former chief creative officer Lasseter's step down. He co-wrote \"Toy Story 4\", which was released on June 21, 2019. Initially, when he pitched the idea to director Josh Cooley, Cooley was concerned feeling like \"Toy Story 3\" was the perfect ending. Stanton reportedly told Cooley \"Toy Story 3 was a good ending-but it's not the ending\". He explained that it wasn't the ending of Woody's story but rather the ending of Woody's time with Andy. Immediately after the conversation, Cooley agreed to direct the film alongside Lasseter. Stanton reportedly started writing \"Toy Story 4\" in secret while the third film was still in production. It was always in Stanton's drafts to bring Bo Peep back. He has expressed interest in directing more live action films, stating that he wants to return \"[b]ecause it's quicker and it's a little bit more of the opposite... It's the antithesis of animation. Animation you get to control everything, and it's awesome in that sense. But there's no spontaneity, and it takes a long time! And so there's high risk for the complete opposite reasons of live-action.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1832762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832762", "title": "Someday (Mariah Carey song)", "text": "Someday (Mariah Carey song)\n\n\"Someday\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album (1990). It is a dance-pop song with new jack swing influences. Prior to Carey signing a record contract, she and producer Ben Margulies had written and produced a four-track demo which included \"Someday\". After signing a contract with Columbia Records, Carey began work on her debut album and she reached out to Ric Wake to ask if he would produce the song, to which he agreed. The composition of the demo recording was changed during the recording process, most notably replacing the horns with a guitar, which Carey disapproved of.\n\n\"Someday\" was released as the album's third single on November 15, 1990, in the United Kingdom and was released the following month in the United States with multiple remixes. The song was a critical and commercial success, being described as an album highlight and becoming Carey's third consecutive number-one single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Someday\" was subsequently included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including \"#1's\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), \"The Essential Mariah Carey\" (2011) and \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015).\n\nIn 1988, an 18-year-old Mariah Carey moved out from her mother's house in Long Island and into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice \"glimpses\" of Carey's \"gifted\" vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry.\n\nOne evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey; as she handed him the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, and said that he would tend to \"the project\". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.\n\nPrior to Carey signing her record deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and produced fourteen songs over a three-year period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including \"Someday\". \"Someday\" was one of the four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that \"Someday\" was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying \"I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me.\"\n\n\"Someday\" was recorded and mixed by Bob Cadway at The Power Station in New York City. In addition to be written by Carey and Margulies, they also arranged the song with Chris Toland. In addition to producing the track, Wake also carried out additional arrangement with Rich Tancredi. The drum programming was performed by Wake and Joe Franco, while Cadway played the guitars and Tancredi the keyboards. Carey performed all of her own background vocals. Carey later revealed that \"Someday\" was one of her favorite songs on the demo and that she would \"listen to it over and over again on the subway after the studio sessions\". However, Carey later expressed her disapproval of some of the new elements added during the production of \"Mariah Carey\", such as the replacement of the horns on the demo in favor of an electric guitar.\n\nThe fourth song on the track list of \"Mariah Carey\", \"Someday\" is the album's first up-tempo track. It is a dance-pop song with new jack swing influences, which lasts for a duration of four minutes, six seconds. \"Someday\" is set in common time and in the key of E major. Carey's vocal range spans from the low-note of E to the high whistle note of F. Lyrically, it is about how Carey is \"gleefully\" waiting for bad karma to come to her ex-boyfriend who \"dumped\" her, which can be heard in the lyrics \"Cause I know you'll soon discover / you're needing me in spite of all the others.\" AllMusic writer Ashley S. Battel said it is \"energetic\". \"Music & Media\" described the song as \"upbeat dance pop with a prominent role for Carey's joyous and confident vocals.\" To mark twenty-five years since the release of \"Mariah Carey\" in June 1990, \"Billboard\" writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that, being the fourth track on the track listing, it is the album's first up-tempo song and that is \"beats new life\" into it as a result. However, he felt that some of the rhythmic arrangements and the electric guitar solo during the bridge prevented \"Someday\" from sounding timeless.\n\n\"Someday\" was released as the third single \"Mariah Carey\" as a CD single in the United Kingdom on November 15, 1990, and as a maxi single in the United States on December 13, 1990. Included on the maxi single are the 'New 7\" Jackswing,' the 'New 7\" Straight,' the 'New 12\" Jackswing' and the 'Pianopercapella – New' mix, all of which were produced by Shep Pettibone, while \"Alone in Love\" was included as the B-side. \"Alone in Love\" was also written by Carey and Margulies, and produced by Rhett Lawrence. \"Someday\" has been included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including \"#1's\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), \"The Essential Mariah Carey\" (2011), and \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015).\n\nDespite having released two highly successful albums, \"Mariah Carey\" and \"Emotions\" (1991), the singer had yet to embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on \"MTV Unplugged\" to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of \"Someday\", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back to give it a rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of \"#1 to Infinity\", Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on \"Mariah Carey\" and stated that she wished she could \"delete some of the overproduction,\" which is why she decided to include the \"MTV Unplugged\" version on the compilation instead. The arrangement of \"MTV Unplugged\" rendition was also included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015–17).\n\nIn the United States, \"Someday\" became Carey's third consecutive number-one single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 following \"Vision of Love\" and \"Love Takes Time\". \"Someday\" became her first song to top the Dance Club Songs chart on March 16, 1991, and her second chart topper on the Radio Songs chart. The track peaked at number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number five on the Adult Contemporary chart. After three months of release, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the song gold, denoting shipments of more than 500,000 copies. In 2015, \"Billboard\" writer Gary Trust compiled a list of Carey's twenty-five best performing songs based on their weekly performance; \"Someday\" ranks as the singer's eighth best performing track of her career on the Hot 100. Trust also noted that Carey \"proved her way\" by releasing a club song which reached number-one following two chart-topping ballads. In Canada, \"Someday\" reached at number five on the main chart, but peaked at number one on both the Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts. It also reached a peak of number four on the Dance chart. Outside of North America, \"Someday\" reached the top fifteen in New Zealand, the top forty in France and the United Kingdom, and the top fifty in Australian and Belgium.\n\nThe accompanying music video begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering a high school corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about in the classroom and corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 5.6 million views on YouTube as of April 2020.\n\nThe extended version of the video was included on \"The First Vision\" 1991 VHS and its subsequent DVD reissue, in which Carey stated that she loved watching the kids dancing and getting to interact with them and that she had fun during the video shoot. The video was removed from the tracklisting of the \"#1's\" video release, as Carey felt ashamed of the results of the video, instead being replaced by the \"MTV Unplugged\" performance.\n\nIn 2015, to coincide with the release of \"#1 to Infinity\" Carey released videos of herself talking about the videos to songs on the compilation. For \"Someday\", Carey stated that she \"hates\" the video, mainly because of the \"tomfoolery\" scenes of the kids. She said that she would have kept only the closeups and that the girl playing the younger version of herself was cute.\n\nUS CD Maxi single\n\n\"Someday\" 7\"\n\n\"Someday\" 12\"\n\nRecording\n\nVocals\n\nPersonnel\nRecording\n\nVocals\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Mariah Carey\". \"Someday\" remixes and alternate versions co-produced by Shep Pettibone with Ric Wake.\n\n\n"}
