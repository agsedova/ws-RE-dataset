It is in the southeast corner of Labuan and its Malay name, Bandar Victoria, is commonly used in honor the reign of Queen Victoria . The town is an urban district within the wider city limits of Victoria which includes Labuan Port, a sheltered deep-water harbour which is an important trans-shipment point for Brunei Darussalam, northern Sarawak and western Sabah.\n\nSince the 15th century, the town area including other parts of Labuan were under the Bruneian Empire. Its history dates back to the time when the island was ceded by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II to the British. Rodney Mundy, a British naval officer, later visited the island under the name of Queen Victoria. The island was then occupied by Japan from 3 January 1942 until June 1945 and governed as part of the Northern Borneo military unit by the Japanese 37th Army. During the Battle of Labuan it was liberated by the 9th Division of Australian Imperial Force on 10 June 1945 and placed under a British Military Administration until 15 July 1946, when it was incorporated into North Borneo Crown Colony. During this time, the Crown Colony government re-established much of the infrastructure that had been destroyed during the war. The island later became part of the state of Sabah and Malaysia in 1963 before the state government of Sabah ceded the island to the federal government in 1984. It was declared an international offshore financial centre and free trade zone in 1990 to assist the development of Victoria.\n\nThe major products produced on Labuan and exported through Labuan Port include copra, rubber and sago. The port is on a natural deep-water bay where large vessels can anchor as it is sheltered from typhoons. Vessels received include containers, bulk, and general cargoes. The main jetty is 244 metres long with an alongside depth of 8.5 metres and it can accommodate vessels to 16,000 DWT. The wharf has four berths. There are about 15,600 m² available in open storage, two warehouses and a container yard. A 10,000 m² yard and warehouses are available outside the port. Its capacity is 100,000 TEUs of containerised cargo per annum. Five private jetties are installed: the Shell Jetty that specialises in petroleum; the Iron Ore Jetty; the Methanol Jetty; and two offshore wheat and maize jetties called the Asian Supply Base Jetty and the Sabah Flour Mill Jetty.\n\nVictoria's Financial Park along Jalan Merdeka houses offshore teams of international banks, insurance and trust companies. Victoria is an offshore support hub for deepwater oil and gas activities in the region. In 2012, Victoria had a population of over 85,000 with nearly half of those coming from elsewhere in Malaysia and from Brunei Darussalam. It has a 1,500-seat convention hall adjoining a large shopping mall; these form a modern complex which enhances Victoria's status among International Offshore Financial Centres.\n\nVictoria, Labuan features a tropical rainforest climate (Af), which is true for virtually all of Malaysia due to its close proximity near the equator, with constantly high temperatures and abundant rainfall over the course of the year. Like all cities and town with this climate, there is no dry season and the temperature in the city averages 26.9 °C, while the average annual rainfall is 2207 mm.\n\nVictoria currently has one sister city:\n"}

According to \"Q\" magazine, after leaving the band Mason was so deep in debt at one point that he was forced to take a second job on a building site. The singer was also crippled by a depression that only recently lifted.\n\nDuring the Beta Band era, Steve appeared on TV shows including \"The Adam & Joe Show\" (2001) and \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\" (2005).\n\nMason released solo material as King Biscuit Time, including two EPs on Regal Records and one album on No Style Records, an imprint of Alan McGee's Poptones record label. Mason has also worked under the name Black Affair, and has released one album under this pseudonym on V2 Records.\n\nOn 19 April 2009, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Mason was working on a new album with the record producer, Richard X. This album, \"Boys Outside\", was released in March 2010 and is the first album under Mason's own name. The first single, \"All Come Down\", was released as a download at the end of November 2009. \"Q\" gave the album a 4/5 rating. According to Rob Fearn, the album \"relocates Mason in a grand tradition of indie boys doing idiosyncratic electronic pop, a line stretching back through Hot Chip, New Order, Talk Talk and Brian Eno\". Fearn argued that the album, \"totally different from what he did in King Biscuit Time and Black Affair\", might be seen as a \"welcome return to a stripped-down songcraft\". It is \"...not just a work that can finally measure up to [Beta Band's] \"The Three EPs\", but is a sign of a \"bold new start\", according to the critic.\n\nIn 2013, Mason released \"Monkey Minds in the Devil's Time\". The album covers topics as diverse as his recent struggles with depression and loneliness, the suicide of David Kelly (former weapons inspector in Iraq) and the London riots. The Independent called it \"his most rewarding release since the Beta Band\".\n\n"}

The district has an area of , making it the smallest district in the country.\n\nAccording to Dr Ashraf Siddiqui, the district is named after the 16th century dervish Meher Ali Shah. The Meherpur Municipality is one of the oldest municipalities in Bangladesh which was established on 1859 when Meherpur was a part of the Nadia district.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Bangladesh was formed and solemnly sworn in Meherpur's Baidyanathtala village (later renamed as Mujibnagar), on 17 April 1971. The entire Proclamation ceremony was organised by local leaders under the supervision of Momeen Chowdhury and MM Rustom Ali.

{"id": "2271430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271430", "title": "Honkarakenne", "text": "Honkarakenne\n\nHonkarakenne Oyj () is a Finnish company that manufactures log homes. Honka is also a registered trademark of the company.\n\nIn 2016 the company's main markets were Finland, Germany, France, Russia and Japan. A total of 49% of net sales came from exports. Honkarakenne’s factory is located in Karstula, Central Finland. By 2018, Honkarakenne had delivered about 85,000 log homes to more than 50 countries.\n\nHonkarakenne has been a listed company since 1987. Its B-shares are now on the Small Cap list of the Helsinki Stock Exchange.\n\nHonkarakenne’s roots go back to a company named Sahaus- ja Höyläysliike Veljekset Saarelainen, established in Hattuvaara, Lieksa, in 1958. Three brothers, Viljo, Arvo and Reino Saarelainen, originally had stakes in the company, which used an outdoor circular saw and planing machine. Their business idea was to develop the industrial production of log cabins, which was practically new to Finland at the time. They developed some machine tools, such as their round log machine, themselves.\n\nThe company's first prefabricated round-log villa, was introduced in 1963 and it launched its first villa collection in the same year. The cabins were prefabricated, but adaptable. In 1964, Nestori and Eino Saarelainen also joined the company, which was renamed Honkatuote Veljekset Saarelainen.\n\nEino Saarelainen became the company's sales representative for Southern Finland and a sales office was opened in Helsinki in 1965. The company's first exhibition house, next to Eino Saarelainen's detached house, was built in Tuusula in 1966. As sales increased, the company outgrew the production capacity of the Lieksa plant. Capital was raised for growth by expanding the company's ownership after which the brothers owned one third of Honkatuote Oy. \n\nThere were continuous conflicts between the brothers and Honkatuote’s main owners about the company's development needs. When cooperation became impossible, the Saarelainen brothers founded their own sales company, renamed Honkarakenne T. Saarelainen & Co. Ky. ‘T’ referred to their father, Tahvo, because they were wary of starting up a new business in their own names. Eino Saarelainen became CEO of the company. In 1967, Honkarakenne Ky was founded as the parent company, and Reino Saarelainen moved to Ikaalinen to plan the company's own round-log production. Reino and Nestori Saarelainen started production at Pohjois-Karjalan Honka Ky in 1967. They were granted a patent for their automated round-log production line.\n\nHonkarakenne became a limited liability company in 1970. The Saarelainen brothers had no control over the innovative round-log manufacturing technology developed by Reino Saarelainen. Round logs were being produced in Ikaalinen, but the brothers believed in the future of the industrially manufactured round log. However, their financial situation prevented them from regaining control of Honkatuote, so they decided to redevelop round-log production from the beginning. In 1971, Honkarakenne expanded its production and sales network. Round-log production began in Central Finland in 1972 under the name of Karstulan Honka Oy, largely due to the interest shown by the municipality of Karstula. The factory had a good location in the middle of Finland's prime log forest, with the factory obtaining its raw materials from a reasonably nearby area. A Japanese export representative, Mr Fukuda, happened to be in Finland seeking suppliers of quality goods and visited the Tuusula exhibition area. This visit led to an agreement to deliver 250 houses to Japan. The Saarelainen brothers used the two million Finnish markka advance payment to buy back the majority of Honkatuote Oy's shares and merge the companies’ operations. Reino Saarelainen was elected CEO of Honkarakenne in 1976.\n\nHonkarakenne was listed on the stock exchange in 1987.\n\nIn 1999 the company exported around 60% of its production and its main markets were Germany, Japan, France and the United States.\n\nIn 2000, Honkarakenne built the Suomi (Finland) house for Sydney’s oldest and most revered golf course at Concord, to mark the Sydney Olympic Games. This resting place after the ninth hole was around 500 square metres in size.\n\nIn 2006 Honkarakenne employed about 400 people, most of them working in Finland where the company had four factories. Honkarakenne also had a worldwide distribution channel and several sales offices abroad. Major exports of products went to France, Germany, Russia and Japan.\n\nIn 2013, the entire production of Honkarakenne was centralised in Karstula, where the company's main plant had been operating since 1971. The plant was given a major expansion in 2014.\n\nSince 2015, Honkarakenne’s CEO has been Marko Saarelainen, a member of the founding family. He became CEO after leading a subsidiary, Honka Japan Inc., where he had served for almost 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, the company's registered office was transferred from Tuusula to Karstula. It had 110 employees in Karstula, around ten in the Helsinki area and the same number in various sales offices. Honkarakenne helped the Chinese authorities to establish log construction standards there.\n\nIn early 2017, the company announced that it would provide 34 log kindergartens around Finland for Pilke Daycare Centres. The value of the contract was EUR 6.9 million. In March, Honkarakenne organised a directed share issue, turning the Jyväskylä-based AKR Invest into a major stakeholder in the company.\n\nBy 2018, Honkarakenne had delivered about 85,000 log homes to more than 50 countries.\n\nIn 2019, Honkarakenne announced a deal with the Chinese Zhangjiakou Winter-Olympic Town Tourism Development Co. Ltd. The agreement concerned the provision of accommodation at the Haitou Valley resort, located near the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The forthcoming six buildings have a floor area of 2,000 square metres and will house hotel-style apartments.\n\nThe company's CEO is Marko Saarelainen, whose grandfather was Viljo Saarelainen, one of the company's founders. Honkarakenne's factory and logistics centre are located in Karstula.\n\nEero Saarelainen, the son of the eldest brother, Viljo Saarelainen, began designing log homes for the company in the 1960s. He designed around 50 in total, but was involved in designing hundreds of models, mainly alongside architect Kari Rainio. In 2020, Honkarakenne's Chief Architect is Anne Mäkinen. In addition to Mäkinen, Honkarakenne’s products are designed by windsurfing Olympic medallist and architect Tuuli Petäjä-Sirén. Prize-winning industrial designer, Harri Koskinen, designed Honkarakenne's Kontti collection of modern, small cabins, which were first exhibited at the Pori Housing Fair in 2018.\n\nHonkarakenne manufactures log homes, i.e. single-family houses, log cabins, log saunas and Honka Frame wooden houses. Honkarakenne also supplies larger public buildings such as clinics and daycare centres.\n\nThe non-settling log developed by the company makes installation easier by eliminating the need to account for settling of the log structure. The frame’s tightness, fast installation and maintenance-free nature are major advantages. Honkarakenne spends around 1 % of its annual net sales on research and development.\n\nThe company has collaborated with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Tampere University of Technology. As an impartial body, VTT is responsible for quality control of log products on behalf of the entire company.\n\nHonkarakenne's main market area is Finland. The company is the market leader in log-built leisure homes, but has also increased its sales of single-family houses since 2010.\n\nHonkarakenne has representatives in almost every country in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe. By far its largest log buildings are ordered from Russia. Most builders are newly prosperous or wealthy companies, but recent customers also include well-to-do middle-class clients. Honka also has a number of extensive projects underway in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. It also has significant net sales in the former CIS countries. Exports to the Far East are focused on Japan and South Korea, and the company has representatives in countries such as China and Mongolia. Individual projects have been implemented in countries as far away as Kenya.\n\n\nThere are four books written about the company:\n\n"}

The first fort was built in 1722.\n\nThe original fort served as a successful trading post until 1747, when English-allied Huron warriors under Chief Nicholas found it undermanned—the commandant, Ensign Douville, and most of the soldiers were away at Fort Detroit. The fort was sacked and burned to the ground.\n\nIn Summer 1749, a force of French and Indians under Captain Pierre Blainville rebuilt the fort. This second fort survived the French and Indian War, but it was attacked in 1752, and two soldiers from the French garrison were caught outside the fort and killed. In November 1760, at the close of the French and Indian War, the French garrison formally surrendered Fort Miami to Ensign Holmes of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The British soon lost control of the fort in 1763, during Pontiac's Rebellion, and the fort was destroyed by the Indians.\n\nThe British refortified the town, and the trading post again became successful. It was sacked in 1780 by a force under Augustin de La Balme, a French cavalry officer who came to the new United States of America to assist with the American Revolutionary War. The force raided the stores, but was soon destroyed by Miami Chief Little Turtle, and the goods were returned. The coalition at Kekionga remained true to their British allies even after the area was ceded to the United States at the close of the war. It therefore became a target of American armies, leading to several noteworthy Indian victories now known as the Northwest Indian War. One such battle, Hardin's Defeat (1790), occurred within sight of the fort.\n\nThe Northwest Indian War ended with the Battle of Fallen Timbers, where General Anthony Wayne finally achieved an American victory. A new fort was built on the location and occupied by forces under Gen. Wayne in Sept.-Oct., 1794, and rechristened Fort Wayne, the fort which gave the name to the settlement and became the modern city of Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\n"}

The fort was located at the eastern edge of present-day Maumee, Ohio, southwest of Toledo.\nThe British built the fort to forestall a putative assault on Fort Detroit by Gen. \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne's army, then advancing \nnorthward in southwestern Ohio\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the American Revolutionary War the region south of the Great Lakes and between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers was assigned to the United States. The British, however, refused to evacuate their troops from their forts in the region, claiming that the U.S. had not complied with portions of the treatypre-Revolution debts owed to British merchants and subjects had not been paid, and confiscation of Loyalist properties continued.\n\nIn the early 1790s, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, made an aggressive effort to aid the \"Western Confederacy\" of Native American tribes (the Shawnee, Miami, Wyandot, and others) in the Maumee and Wabash River watersheds in their ongoing war with American settlers. His ultimate goal was the establishment of an Indian barrier state in the region, as a way to protect Britain's North American fur trade ventures, and to block anticipated American attacks upon their remaining North American possessions.\n\nIn spring 1794 the British built Fort Miami to forestall U.S. Gen. Anthony Wayne's advance on Britain's Fort Detroit, and to encourage the confederated tribes in their war of resistance. The fort was a log stockade, which had four bastions, each capable of mounting four cannon, a river battery, barracks, officers' quarters, supply buildings, and various shops. A defensive ditch, 20 to 25 feet deep, ran along the land side of the fort.\n\nIn July 1794 General Wayne and his troops marched northward toward Fort Miami from Fort Recovery. Just south of Fort Miami, encountering a barricade erected by the Native Americans and a small party of Canadian militia, he ordered a charge and dispersed his adversaries in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Native Americans fled to the fort, but the commander shut them out. Beaten and disillusioned, the Native Americans dispersed and one year later their tribal elders gathered at Fort Greenville to negotiate with Wayne. The Treaty of Greenville opened most of the present State of Ohio and part of Indiana to United States settlement. In 1796, under the terms of the Jay Treaty (1794), the British abandoned Fort Miamialong with their other forts on American soil. Wayne occupied and garrisoned it, but about 1799 it was abandoned.\n\nThe British again occupied the site during the War of 1812, which at the time was opposite the American Fort Meigs. During the War, Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief, and British officials maintained headquarters at the fort, from where they moved against Gen. William Henry Harrison at Fort Meigs.\n\nAbandoned again in 1814, the fort was eventually demolished. Afterward, the site reverted to agricultural and, later, public park use.\n\nToday, the site of Fort Miami sits as a small enclave within a residential development. Nothing remains of the original structure except parts of the earthworks.\n\nIn 1942 several Ohio civic and patriotic organizations acquired a part of the fort site. In 1953 the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society conducted preliminary excavations, and in 1957 the Historical Society of Northwestern Ohio placed a marker at the site, which remains undeveloped. In 1975, the site of the fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe site of the fort was incorporated into Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort Miamis National Historic Site in 1999, under Public Law 106-164. The site is managed by the Metropolitan Park District of the Toledo Area (Metroparks), in partnership with the Ohio Historical Society, and is an \"affiliated unit\" of the National Park System.\n\nA state memorial has been created at the site. Also, Ft. Miami Elementary School of the Maumee City School District is two blocks away and named after the fort.\n\n"}

He had established himself as one of Europe's preeminent entomologists by 1867 when he accepted a position at Harvard University to curate the Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1870 he became the first entomologist in the United States to hold the formal title, Professor of Entomology.\n\nHagen was born 30 May 1817 in Königsberg, Prussia. He was the son of Anna (Linck) Hagen and Carl Heinrich Hagen. His father was a senior government counselor and a professor of political science at the University of Königsberg and his grandfather, Karl Gottfried Hagen, was a professor of chemistry at the same university.\n\nYoung Hagen graduated from a gymnasium in 1836 and began to study medicine at the University of Königsberg. His course of studies was greatly influenced by his zoology professor, Martin Heinrich Rathke and together they toured major entomological collections and libraries in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. In 1839 he published his first paper, \"List of the Dragonflies of East Prussia\". In 1840, he received his medical degree, having written his thesis on European species of dragonflies. He then studied medicine in Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and elsewhere. In 1843, he returned to Königsberg, entered into the general practice of medicine, and for three years was first assistant at a surgical hospital.\n\nIn spite of the heavy workload at the hospital, Hagen continued his entomological studies. He published several papers on dragonflies as a result of his close collaboration with Edmond de Sélys Longchamps. They remained collaborators even after Hagen emigrated to America. Hagen also published the \"Monographie des Termites\" from 1855 to 1860. This detailed study of termites was called \"a masterpiece of original work\".\n\nIn 1856, Hagen met the Russian entomologist, Karl Robert Osten-Sacken. Osten-Sacken convinced Hagen to make a study of the Neuroptera of North America and sent him large collections of material, including insects he had collected in the American West. In 1861 Hagen published the resulting \"Synopsis of the Neuroptera of North America\". In addition to his work on living Neuroptera, Hagen made important and pioneering studies of extinct Neuroptera, especially the Mesozoic European species found trapped in amber. One of his best known works was \"Bibliotheca Entomologica\". Published as two volumes in 1862 and 1863, it was an attempt to list all the publications on entomology up to 1862. For many years after publication it was considered one of the most accurate and complete scientific bibliographies available.\n\nIn spite of a busy medical practice and a full program of scientific studies, Hagen also found time to serve as a member of the school board and vice-president of the city council in Königsberg from 1863 to 1867. While holding these civic offices, he was invited by Louis Agassiz to come to Cambridge as assistant in entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. Agassiz had been encouraged in this idea by Osten-Sacken. Hagen accepted, and in 1867 he emigrated to the United States. In Cambridge he became curator of the museum's entomological collections and in 1870 he was named Professor of Entomology, becoming the first person in America to hold that title.\n\nHagen approached his new responsibilities with great energy. Under his direction the entire entomological collection was reorganized, cleaned and stored in new boxes and cabinets. The revitalized museum attracted significant new collections donated by some of America's leading entomologists. He is also credited with reversing the traditional flow of insect collections from America to Europe. In 1877 for example, Hermann Loew's collection of American Diptera in Berlin was repatriated to Cambridge.\n\nHagen was also an influential teacher at Harvard. Several of his students went on to become notable entomologists, including John Henry Comstock, Albert J. Cook, Herbert Osborn, Henry G. Hubbard, and Charles W.

It is considered a development of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism (MLM) and named after the leader of the UCPN(M), Pushpa Kamal Dahal, commonly known as Prachanda. Prachanda Path was proclaimed in 2001. The ideology was partially inspired by the example of the Communist Party of Peru (Shining Path), which refers to its ideological line as \"Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Gonzalo Thought\".\n\nPrachanda Path does not claim to make an ideological break with Marxism, Leninism or Maoism, but rather to be an extension of these ideologies based on the politics of Nepal. The doctrine came into existence after the party determined that the ideologies of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism could no longer be practiced completely as they been in the past. The party adopted Prachanda Path as they felt it was a suitable ideology based on the reality of Nepalese politics. Militarily and in the context of the 1996–2006 armed conflict in Nepal, central to the ideology was the achievement of revolution through the control of rural areas and the encirclement of urban settlements.\n\nToday, Prachanda's positions are seen by some Marxist–Leninist–Maoists around the world as \"revisionist\" and are criticized by revolutionary organizations within Nepal. These criticisms focus on the entry of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) into mainstream party politics in Nepal. These criticisms have also drawn on the cooperation between UCPN-M under Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist).\n\n\n"}

It is the oldest land conservation nonprofit organization of its kind in the world and has 140,000 dues-paying members . In addition to land stewardship, the organization is also active in conservation partnerships, community supported agriculture (CSA), environmental and conservation education, community preservation and development, and green building. The Trustees of Reservations own title to 116 properties on in Massachusetts, all of which are open to the public; it maintains conservation restrictions on over 200 additional properties. Properties include historic mansions, estates, and gardens; woodland preserves; waterfalls; mountain peaks; wetlands and riverways; coastal bluffs, beaches, and barrier islands; farmland and CSA projects; and archaeological sites.\n\nMain offices of the organization are located in Beverly, Leominster, and Sharon, Massachusetts. Financial support for the organization comes from membership dues, annual contributions, property admission fees, special events, grants, and endowments. In June 2006, The Trustees earned gold-level recognition from the United States Green Building Council for its Doyle Conservation Center in Leominster. In 2014, after seven years as an affiliate, the Boston Natural Areas Network merged with the Trustees of Reservations.\n\nThe Trustees of Reservations was proposed in 1890 when the New England periodical \"Garden and Forest\" published a letter by landscape architect Charles Eliot (protégé of Frederick Law Olmsted) entitled \"The Waverly Oaks.\" Eliot's letter proposed the immediate preservation of \"special bits of scenery\" still remaining \"within of the State House which possess uncommon beauty and more than usual refreshing power.\" To this end, Eliot proposed that legislation be enacted to create a nonprofit corporation to hold land for the public to enjoy \"just as a Public Library holds books and an Art Museum holds pictures.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1891, the Massachusetts Legislature established The Trustees of Public Reservations \"for the purposes of acquiring, holding, maintaining and opening to the public beautiful and historic places within the Commonwealth.\" The act was signed into law by Governor William E. Russell on May 21, 1891. The word \"Public\" was dropped from the organization's name in 1954 to avoid confusion with government-owned land.\n\nVirginia Wood in Stoneham was the first property acquired by The Trustees. This property was conveyed to the Metropolitan District Commission in 1923 and is now a part of the Middlesex Fells Reservation. Waverly Oaks itself was also conveyed to the state by The Trustees and is part of the Beaver Brook Reservation, established in 1893.\n\nIn 1925, The Trustees joined with the Appalachian Mountain Club, Massachusetts Audubon Society, and the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England) to organize a conference on \"The Needs and Uses of Open Spaces.\" This conference led to a 1929 report emphasizing the need to protect the state's rural character and countryside and the importance of identifying and describing the qualities and characteristics of specific sites that should be preserved. Today, nearly every site listed in the report is protected by a government or nonprofit conservation agency.\n\nThe mission statement of The Trustees of Reservations is to \"preserve, for public use and enjoyment, properties of exceptional scenic, historic, and ecological value in Massachusetts.\" The Trustees of Reservations also supports a number of contingent initiatives.\n\n\"The Putnam Conservation Institute\", also known as the \"Conservation Common,\" offers workshops, conferences, and networking for \"land conservationists, urban park advocates, historic preservationists, watershed associations, state agencies, municipal commissions,\" etc.\n\n\"The Highland Communities Initiative\" is a cooperative effort of The Trustees and community members from small hilltowns in The Berkshires geography dedicated to preserving regional cultural and physical landscapes and enhancing the quality of life of local residents;\n\n\"The Doyle Conservation Center\" is a green architecture initiative and regional office, conference, and education center located in Leominster, Massachusetts. The structure, designed by HKT Architects of Somerville, Massachusetts and landscape architects Hines Wasser & Associates, was registered for a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certification with the United States Green Building Council. The building includes \"photovoltaic panels, high-efficiency lighting and controls, a displacement ventilation system, high performance windows, a high performance building envelope, geothermal wells and carbon dioxide monitoring systems;\" it incorporates green materials such as desks made of sunflower seeds, bamboo and cork flooring, and recycled fiber carpet and paneling.\n\nCopicut Woods, Slocum's River Reserve, the Tully Trail, and Appleton Farms represent collaborative efforts of The Trustees of Reservations, government agencies, local communities, and private groups to create a bioreserve, a mixed use open space preserve, a recreation trail, and a mixed use and community supported agriculture preserve, respectively. Copicut Woods is part of the cooperatively managed Southeastern Massachusetts Bioreserve which protects of forest in Fall River, Freetown and Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Slocum's River Reserve is a cooperative effort by the state, The Trustees and the Dartmouth Natural Resources Trust and includes protected braken river frontage and farming conservation restrictions. The Tully Trail, of northern Worcester County, is a collaborative recreational project produced by The Trustees, the Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust, Harvard University's Harvard Forest, the National Park Service, the New England Forestry Foundation, state agencies, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Appleton Farms of Ipswich is a combination CSA project, retail feed and mulch haying operation, livestock and dairy program, recreation area, and ecological preservation area; it includes experiential education programs for adults and children. Current conservation projects include cooperative efforts on the Mount Tom Range and interpretive development of the birthplace of suffragist Lucy Stone in West Brookfield, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Trustees of Reservations owns and manages a broad range of properties across the state of Massachusetts. Many properties contain historic buildings, including nine historic house museums and two lighthouses open to the public. The Trustees manage five National Historic Landmarks, one National Natural Landmark, and several properties that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, The Trustees of Reservations manages, per contract, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Tully Lake Campground in Royalston; the Westport Town Farm in Westport; and Norton Point Beach in Edgartown, which is owned by the county government of Dukes County. The Trustees' properties spill over into both Connecticut and Vermont.\n\nNotable properties include Bartholomew's Cobble of Sheffield, a National Natural Landmark containing North America's greatest diversity of fern species; Crane Beach and the Castle Hill mansion of Ipswich, a barrier beach and National Historic Landmark; Doane's Falls and Royalston Falls, popular waterfalls located in Royalston; Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge, a barrier island located on Martha's Vineyard; The Old Manse of Concord, made famous by transcendentalist writer Nathaniel Hawthorne; Naumkeag a gilded-age historic mansion and National Historic Landmark located in Stockbridge; World's End on Boston Harbor, a coastal peninsula park transformed from an unrealized Frederick Law Olmsted residential subdivision design; and Dinosaur Footprints, a rock face in Holyoke containing 134 footprints of Triassic dinosaur species. Moose Hill Farm in Sharon and Cormier Woods in Uxbridge are some of its most recent acquisitions.\n\n\n"}

Nihang are believed to have originated either from Fateh Singh and the attire he wore or from the \"Akali Dal\" (lit. Army of the Immortal) started by Guru Hargobind. Early Sikh military history was dominated by the Nihang, known for their victories where they were heavily outnumbered. Traditionally known for their bravery and ruthlessness in the battlefield, the Nihang once formed the irregular guerrilla squads of the armed forces of the Sikh Empire, the Sikh Khalsa Army,the following.\n\n\"Nihang\" may come from the Persian word for a mythical sea creature (). The term owes its origin to Mughal historians, who compared the ferocity of the Akali with that of crocodiles. The meaning of Akali in Sikhism however, is the immortal army of Akal (god).\n\nTraditional Nihang dress is known as \"Khalsa Swarupa.\" This comprises full attire of superelectric blue selected by Guru Gobind Singh Ji after conflicts with Vazir Khan, the Mughal Governor of Sirhind, edged bracelets of iron round their wrists (\"jangi kara\") and quoits of steel (\"chakram\") tiered in their lofty conical blue turbans, together with the traditional dagger carried by all Sikhs (\"kirpan\"). When fully armed a Nihang will also bear one or two swords (either the curved talwar or the straight khanda) on his right hip, a katar (dagger) on his left hip, a buckler made from buffalo-hide (\"dhala\") on his back, a large chakram around his neck, and an iron chain. In times of war, arms worn on the Nihang's person would generally be reserved until the warrior lost the weapon he held, often a bow or spear (\"barsha\"). Armour consisted of \"sanjo\" or iron chainmail worn under an iron breastplate (\"char aina\"). Nihang war-shoes (\"jangi mozeh\") were constructed of iron at the toe, making their pointed toes capable of inflicting cuts and stab wounds.\n\nThe Nihang were particularly famous for their high turbans (\"dastar bunga\") and their extensive use of the chakram or war-quoit. Their turbans were often pointed at the top and outfitted with a chand torra or trident which could be used for stabbing in close-quarters. Other times, the turbans would be armed with a bagh naka (iron claw) and one or several chakram to slice at an opponent's eyes. These steel-reinforced turbans, it was said, afforded enough protection so that there was no need for any other form of headgear. Today, Nihang still wear miniature versions of five weapons (\"pancha shastra\") in their turbans, namely the chakram, the khanda (sword), the \"karud\" (dagger), the kirpan, and the \"tir\" (arrow).\n\nNihang today are accorded great respect and affection by sections of the Sikh community, but they have separate beliefs and certain practices. While the order is primarily ceremonial, they are duty-bound to defend their people and faith in times of war. Nihang gather in their thousands at Anandpur, in the state of Punjab, India. Located near the Sutlej River, the city is one of the most sacred places in Sikhism, where they display their martial skills.\n\nSome Nihang groups consume cannabis or shaheedi degh () , purpotedly to help in meditation.\n\nIn 2001, Jathedar Santa Singh, the leader of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of \" shaheedi degh\" by the apex Sikh clergy - in order to preserve traditional sikh practices. \nAccording to a recent BBC article, \"Traditionally they also drank shaheedi degh, an infusion of cannabis, to become closer with God\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2271489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271489", "title": "William Batten", "text": "William Batten\n\nSir William Batten (1600/1601c. 1667) was an English naval officer and politician, who sat in the House of Commons from 1661 to 1667. As Surveyor of the Navy, he was a colleague of Samuel Pepys, who disliked him and regularly disparaged him in his famous Diary.\n\nBatten was the son of Andrew Batten of Somerset, master in the Royal Navy. In 1625 he was stated to be one of the commanders of two ships sent on a whaling voyage to Spitsbergen by the Yarmouth merchant Thomas Horth. In August 1626 he took out letters of marque for the \"Salutation\" of London, owned by Andrew Hawes and others. He was master of the \"Salutation\" again in 1628, and in April of the following year Batten, along with Horth and Hawes, was ordered by the Privy Council not to send up the \"Salutation\", now of Yarmouth, to \"Greenland\" (Spitsbergen), but they sent her and another ship up anyway. The ships of the Muscovy Company seized both ships at Spitsbergen and drove them away clean (empty). In 1630 he was master and part-owner of the \"Charles\" of London, and in 1635 was still serving as a master in the merchant service. In 1638 he obtained the post of Surveyor of the Navy, probably by purchase.\n\nIn March 1642 Batten was appointed second-in-command under Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, the Parliamentary admiral who took the fleet out of the King's hands, and up to the end of the First Civil War showed himself a steady partisan of Parliament. It was Vice-Admiral Batten's squadron which bombarded Scarborough when Henrietta Maria landed there. He was accused (it appears unjustly) by the Royalists of directing his fire particularly on the house occupied by the Queen. In 1643 he was appointed Captain of Deal Castle. In 1644 he was at Plymouth, where he fortified the tip of the peninsula, which has been known since as Mount Batten. Batten continued to patrol the English seas until the end of the First Civil War. His action in 1647 in bringing into Portsmouth a number of Swedish warships and merchantmen which had refused the customary salute to the flag, was approved by Parliament.\n\nWhen the Second Civil War broke out, he was distrusted by the Independents and removed from his command, though he professed continued willingness to serve the state. When part of the fleet revolted against Parliament and joined the Prince of Wales in May 1648, Batten went with them. He was knighted by the prince, but being suspected by the Royalists, was put ashore mutinously in Holland. He returned to England and lived in retirement during the Commonwealth period.\n\nAt the Restoration, Batten became once more Surveyor of the Navy. This put him in constant communication with Samuel Pepys, who mentions him frequently in his Diary. Pepys came to dislike Batten and made numerous insinuations against his integrity, but there is no evidence to show that Batten, in making a profit from his office, fell below the generally accepted ethical standards of the time (nor Pepys's own standards, since he also accepted bribes). Pepys's picture of Batten is not entirely consistent: he portrays him as a devious schemer, but in fact Batten often comes across in the Diary as a typical old sailor, open-natured and quick-tempered. Pepys himself noted that the easiest way to deal with Batten was to make him lose his temper, \"for then he will tell you everything in his mind\". Relations between Pepys and the Battens were not always unfriendly: when Pepys's old enemy Mr Field, who had sued him successfully for false imprisonment, tried to have him arrested on grounds of the judgement, Pepys acknowledged gratefully that the Battens had sheltered him in their own house until the crisis was over.\n\nBatten was elected in 1661 a member for Rochester in the Cavalier Parliament and held the seat until his death in 1667. In 1663 he was made master of Trinity House. He acquired through marriage an estate at Walthamstow, where he was described by Pepys, with a touch of envy, as \"living like a prince\"; Pepys also thought that the Battens were living well beyond their means. Certainly at Batten's death he left an estate smaller than the family seem to have expected. His heavily indebted eldest son, also named William, sold Walthamstow and all his father's other real property in the 1670s.\n\nBatten married first in 1625 Margaret Browne, daughter of William Browne, by whom he had six children, of whom at least four survived him: William junior (a barrister of Lincoln's Inn), Benjamin, who followed his father into the Navy, Mary, who married James Lemon (or Leming), and Martha (born 1637) who in 1663 married William Castle, a shipwright (\"I do not envy him his wife,\" wrote Pepys spitefully). All the children and their spouses are referred to in Pepys's Diary: he has little good to say of them in general (detesting William Castle in particular), although with his usual eye for an attractive woman, he admired young William Batten's wife, Margaret Alcock. Rather illogically, given his poor relations with the family, he was offended at not being invited to the christening of young William's first child (yet another William) in 1663.\n\nMargaret Browne's brother, Captain John Browne, was master of the ship \"Rosebush\". Pepys, who evidently liked him, expressed his regret at Browne's death in 1663, apparently as a result of a drunken fracas with a sailor.\n\nBatten married secondly, in 1659, Elizabeth Woodstocke (née Turner), widow of William Woodstocke of Westminster. Pepys, although he appreciated her presents of home-grown wine, came to dislike Lady Batten as much as he did her husband, and in his Diary made attacks on her virtue, which seem to have had no foundation in fact.\n\nBatten died, \"after being but two days sick\" on 5 October 1667. Pepys, despite their past bad relations, wrote that he was sorry for the death of a good neighbour. He did not attend the funeral, but took an interest in the quarrels between Lady Batten and her stepchildren over the size of her husband's estate; Lady Batten later complained that \"she had been left a beggar.\" Pepys records his condolence call on the widow, noting that widows weep for their husbands, but soon leave off grieving, as is natural given the cares of the world. In 1671 she remarried, as his second wife, Johan Barckmann, Baron Leijonbergh, the Swedish Resident to the English Court (subsequently Ambassador 1672–91); she died in 1683. A quarrel between Pepys and Leijonbergh, which led to an abortive duel, may have been caused by Lady Batten's claim that Pepys was withholding money due to the Batten estate.\n\n"}

The family moved to Los Angeles in the 1920s.\n\nRoberts began working as an actress in the 1930s, under contract to Republic Pictures. At the age of 14, in 1936, she played a role in \"Bulldog Edition\". In 1938, at age 16, she starred in the cliffhangers: \"The Lone Ranger\" and \"Dick Tracy Returns\", and played a role in \"The Higgins Family\". She was officially listed in studio records as having been born in 1919.\nIn 1941 she starred with Sonja Henie and John Payne in \"Sun Valley Serenade\", while under contract to 20th Century-Fox. She returned to Republic Pictures in 1944, and stayed under contract there until 1948. She starred with Gene Autry in \"Sioux City Sue\" in 1946, and appeared in two more films with Autry: \"Robin Hood of Texas\" and \"Saddle Pals\", as well as three films with Roy Rogers, and one with Monte Hale. (Johnny D. Boggs, in his book, \"Billy the Kid on Film, 1911-2012\", wrote, \"Lynne Roberts would co-star with [Roy] Rogers in eight Westerns, billed as Mary Hart in the first seven of those.\")\n\nAfter leaving Republic Pictures for the second time, Roberts worked with Autry in outdoor adventures for Columbia Pictures. She also worked with Kirby Grant in Monogram Pictures' mounted-police adventures, and with Tim Holt at RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nRoberts appeared in 64 films in total. Of those, 21 were westerns, and two were serials.\n\nRoberts married four times. Her first marriage was to William Engelbert, Jr., an aircraft company official, with whom she had one son, Bill. The marriage ended in divorce in 1944.\n\nHer second marriage was to Louis John Gardella, which also ended in divorce.

Its highest point is , and its area is . Its name means \"sacred island\". Older European names for the island are Traitors island or Keppel island.\n\nNiuatoputapu is located in the north of the country, away from Vavau near the border with Samoa. Its closest neighbours are the small island of Tafahi, only to the north-northeast, and the island of Niuafo'ou. The three islands together form the administrative division of the Niuas. There is an airport, Niuatoputapu Airport, which is designated to accept international flights. An estimated population of around 700 in 2020. The inhabitants formerly spoke the Niuatoputapu language, which has now been extinct for centuries, having been replaced with Tongan. Nevertheless, Samoan, Uvean and Futunan elements can be noticed.\n\nThe central top of Niuatoputapu, just beside Vaipoa, is a hill of only in height. It is the eroded remnant of a large volcano, which erupted about 3 million years ago. The island is almost entirely surrounded by a large reef, uplifted, and largely covered with volcanic ash, which has yielded it a fertile soil.\n\nNiuatoputapu consists primarily of three villages: Hihifo (meaning \"west\" in Tongan), Vaipoa, and Falehau. Hihifo is the largest village, and, as its name suggests, lies in the west of the island. It contains the majority of the local governmental facilities, including the post office, telecommunications, police station and a high school (there are primary schools in all 3 villages). Vaipoa lies in the middle of the island. Falehau, which is east of Vaipoa, fronts on the island's only harbor, on the northwest coast.\n\nThe traditional line of lords of the island is the Māatu dynasty. According to the legends, an early member of them became the fish god Seketoa. \n\nNiuatoputapu was put on the European maps by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire during their famous circumnavigation of the globe in their ship the \"Eendracht\" (Unity) in 1616. After successful bartering with the inhabitants of Tafahi, but not finding a suitable anchorage there, they proceeded to its bigger southern neighbour. There their reception was less peaceful. Natives boarded their ship and attacked the Dutch with clubs, until they found out what muskets were and could do. After that an uneasy truce existed, enabling the barter of more coconuts, \"ubes\" roots (probably ufi (yam)), hogs and water. A 'king' of the island came along, but not on board. \"He was equally naked with all the rest\", only distinguishable by the respect the islanders paid to him. The next day the Dutch felt that something was in the air, and indeed when the king came along again he suddenly ordered his people into an attack. There were about 700 to 800 of them in 23 double canoes and 45 single canoes. But the Dutch fired their muskets and 3 cannons, and the islanders then quickly made themselves scarce. Schouten and LeMaire continued their westwards trip, leaving \"Verraders\" (Traitors) island behind. \n\nThe 2001 film \"The Other Side of Heaven\" depicts the LDS missionary efforts of John Groberg on Niuatoputapu. The film was, however, filmed on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands and in Auckland, New Zealand as well.\n\nThe island of Niuatoputapu was affected by the M8 Samoa earthquake and tsunami in the Samoan Islands region at 06:48:11 local time on 29 September 2009 (17:48:11 UTC).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2271571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271571", "title": "Felix Zollicoffer", "text": "Felix Zollicoffer\n\nFelix Kirk Zollicoffer (May 19, 1812 – January 19, 1862) was a newspaperman, three-term United States Congressman from Tennessee, officer in the United States Army, and a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War. He led the first Confederate invasion of eastern Kentucky and was killed in action at the Battle of Mill Springs. Zollicoffer was the first Confederate general to die in the Western Theater.\n\nFelix Zollicoffer was born on a plantation in Bigbyville in Maury County, Tennessee, a son of John Jacob and Martha (Kirk) Zollicoffer. He was descended from emigrants from Switzerland who had settled in North Carolina in 1710. His grandfather, George Zollicoffer, had served as a captain in the Revolutionary War, and had been granted a tract of land in Tennessee as payment for his military service.\n\nZollicoffer attended the local schools and studied for a year at Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee. He left at the age of sixteen, became an apprentice printer, and was engaged in newspaper work in Paris, Tennessee, from 1828 to 1830. When the newspaper closed, he moved to Knoxville in 1831 and worked for two years as a journeyman printer at the \"Knoxville Register\". Three years later, he became editor and part owner of the \"Columbia Observer\". Zollicoffer was elected State Printer of Tennessee in 1835.\n\nOn September 24, 1835, he married Louisa Pocahontas Gordon, with whom he had fourteen children, of whom only six survived infancy. Gordon was the daughter of Captain John Gordon who had fought alongside Andrew Jackson at Horseshoe Bend and Pensacola. She was a direct descendant of Pocahontas through her mother, Dolly. Louisa Zollicoffer died in 1857.\n\nZollicoffer also edited the \"Mercury\" for a time in Huntsville, Alabama. He volunteered for the army in 1836 and served as a second lieutenant in the Tennessee militia in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He then returned to Tennessee and became owner and editor of the \"Columbia Observer\" and the \"Southern Agriculturist\" and in 1843 the editor of the \"Republican Banner\", the state organ of the Whig Party.\n\nThis brought Zollicoffer into political circles, and he was Comptroller of the State Treasury from 1845 to 1849, as well as Adjutant General for the state. He was a member of the State Senate from 1849 until 1852, and was a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1852, supporting General Winfield Scott. Zollicoffer was himself elected as a Whig to the Thirty-third United States Congress and was reelected as a candidate of the American Party to the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1853 – March 3, 1859). During his first campaign, he fought a duel with the editor of the rival \"Nashville Union\" newspaper. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1858 and retired to private life. He supported fellow Tennessee moderate John Bell (CU) for president in the election of 1860.\n\nFollowing the secession of the Deep South in 1861, Zollicoffer served on the peace convention in Washington, D.C. in an attempt to prevent the approaching civil war. A strong supporter of states' rights, Zollicoffer nevertheless opposed Tennessee's secession from the Union.\n\nTennessee voters rejected the call for a secession convention in February 1861. Tennessee Governor Isham Harris soon began to maneuver the state into a position where secession would be inevitable. On May 6, 1861, the Tennessee legislature, urged on by Harris, adopted a \"Declaration of Independence and Ordinance.\" The people were to vote on the ratification of this measure on June 8. A separate vote on the same date would determine if Tennessee should join the Confederacy if the voters approved the measure asserting independence of the State. On May 9, a joint committee of the legislature issued an explanation sponsored by Harris of the military alliance Tennessee had entered into with the Confederacy on May 7. During the period between April and July, Harris organized a state army, the Provisional Army of Tennessee.\n\nUpon the announcement of the formation of the Provisional Army of Tennessee, Zollicoffer offered his service to the state army. Despite only having brief combat experience, he was appointed as a brigadier general in the Provisional Army of Tennessee on May 9, 1861, by Governor Isham Harris.\n\nOn July 9, 1861, Zollicoffer was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. Although the Confederate States Army began to absorb the Provisional Army of Tennessee on July 31, 1861, Zollicoffer's troops were not mustered into Confederate service until the end of October. For almost four months, Zollicoffer was in the strange position of being a Confederate Army general in charge of state troops.\n\nHarris initially tried to sway eastern Tennessee's pro-Union population with a lenient policy and the stationing of only fifteen companies of troops in the region. On July 26, 1861, Harris, who was still in charge of the Tennessee state force, ordered Zollicoffer and 4,000 raw recruits to Knoxville to be in position to suppress resistance to secession in East Tennessee, appointing him to command the District of East Tennessee. Harris was re-elected governor on August 8, 1861 and on August 18, he ordered Zollicoffer to arrest and, if necessary, banish leaders of pro-Union factions from the State, changing his policy from leniency to force.\n\nIn an effort to prevent a Union Army incursion into East Tennessee, Zollicoffer took the initiative and occupied Cumberland Gap on September 14, 1861. Zollicoffer then was responsible for guarding the 128 miles of Confederate line between Cumberland Gap and Tompkinsville, Kentucky. For 71 miles, this line crossed the Cumberland Mountains. On September 15, 1861, General Albert Sidney Johnston assumed command of Confederate forces in the Western Theater between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. He retained Zollicoffer as district commander in east Tennessee.\n\nOn September 17, 1861, Zollicoffer sent a force through the Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road to drive the Union Army from Barbourville, Kentucky, relieve pressure on the recently established Confederate line at Bowling Green, Kentucky and thwart an expected drive by Union Brigadier General George H. Thomas into eastern Tennessee and the Cumberland Gap by forcing him to retain his force in Kentucky. On September 19, 800 of Zollicoffer's men under Colonel Joel Battle ambushed the Union force of about 150 home guards while they were foraging and pushed them out of Barbourville at the minor Battle of Barbourville. Another detachment of Zollicoffer's force under Colonel James Rains dispersed an encampment of Union recruits at Laurel Bridge, Kentucky on September 26, 1861 while the Goose Creek Salt Works were attacked by a second Confederate unit under Colonel D. H. Cummings who carried off 200 barrels of salt. Zollicoffer's force was essentially on a raid and soon withdrew.\n\nIn mid-October 1861, a large part of Zollicoffer's force marched from Cumberland Gap to London, Kentucky. At the Battle of Wildcat Mountain on October 21, Zollicoffer's force was stymied by a prepared Union force fighting on rugged terrain and he soon retreated into rural eastern Tennessee, which remained rife with Union sentiment.\n\nIn November 1861, Zollicoffer changed strategy and advanced westward, then back into southeastern Kentucky to strengthen Confederate control in the area just south of Somerset. He hoped this would put him in a position to be reinforced by Confederate forces from Bowling Green and to drive Thomas's force from the area. Before he moved west, Zollicoffer left forces to guard the Cumberland Gap and three other approaches to east Tennessee.\n\nZollicoffer moved west and established an encampment at Mill Springs, Kentucky (near present-day Nancy, Kentucky) on the south bank of the Cumberland River. By December 6, he moved his force to the north bank of the river where he thought he could better support the supply of his men, build fortifications and keep watch on Thomas's force. This was a risky tactic because Zollicoffer's men were poorly equipped, ill-trained and ill-disciplined. They were not properly prepared to meet the growing Union threat and Zollicoffer's expectation that he would solve this problem by receiving supplies and reinforcements at Beech Grove, opposite Mill Springs, was too optimistic. Many of the men in Confederate service in Tennessee who could have reinforced Zollicoffer's force remained unarmed. Zollicoffer's own reserve force at Knoxville was mostly unarmed.\n\nUnder the circumstances in December 1861, without needed supplies or reserves, Zollicoffer was in no position to move against the Union force. On December 20, 1861, Zollicoffer did not respond to a movement by a force under Brigadier General Albin F. Schoepf who was attempting to provoke Zollicoffer to commit his force to an engagement in the open. Colonel William H. Carroll did not leave Knoxville with his brigade to join Zollicoffer until January 16, 1862. Ultimately, he could bring only a single regiment to Mill Springs, having been ordered to send the rest of his men to Bowling Green.\n\nUnaware of the situation in east Tennessee and of Zollicoffer's plan, on December 8, 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Major General George B. Crittenden to command the district of East Tennessee in order to lead a force into Kentucky. Crittenden assumed command of the district only to find that the ten regiments of soldiers he expected to find there did not exist. Crittenden retained Zollicoffer as commander of the 1st Brigade in his army. On December 15, Zollicoffer sent word to Crittenden that Thomas had ten regiments under his command. While lingering at Knoxville for two more weeks, Crittenden sent word to Zollicoffer to move back to the south side of the Cumberland River. Zollicoffer now had only two rafts to cross the swollen river which was nearly at flood stage. So he stayed at Beech Grove on the north side of the river.\n\nOn January 1, 1862, Thomas moved from his camp at Lebanon, Kentucky to join with Schoepf's troops from Somerset. On January 2, Crittenden arrived at Mill Springs and decided the Confederates should attack Thomas before he could join with Schoepf. The Confederate force of about 6,500 men might have withstood an attack within their fortifications but Thomas's larger force would have the advantage in an open field. Because of the incessant rain and resulting mud, Thomas needed 18 days to move his force and equipment from Lebanon to Logan's Crossroads.\n\nOn January 18, 1862, Crittenden ordered an advance at midnight while the two Union forces under Thomas and Schoepf were separated by the rain-swollen Fishing Creek. Zollicoffer commanded the first brigade toward Logan's Crossroads while Carroll commanded the following brigade.\n\nAfter marching in a driving rain, Zollicoffer's skirmishers attacked the Union pickets south of the intersection of the Mill Springs and Columbia-Somerset roads. The Battle of Mill Springs, sometimes called the Battle of Fishing Creek or the Battle of Logan's Crossroads, a three-hour fight in driving rain, fog and the smoke of battle over thickly wooded ground, followed. The untrained Confederates were totally confused in this situation and their organization was lost. Adding to the confusion, some of the Confederates were wearing blue uniforms. The 15th Mississippi Infantry Regiment mistook the Union 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for blue-clad Confederates. In the confusion, the near-sighted Zollicoffer, wearing a white raincoat, rode into the lines of the 4th Kentucky and began to discuss the problem with the Union colonel, Speed S. Fry. A Confederate aide then rode out of the fog firing at the Union force. Union soldiers returned fire, killing Zollicoffer who had begun to ride away as the incident unfolded. Historian Larry J. Daniel follows some other accounts which claim that Fry recognized and shot Zollicoffer. He further stated that Fry, not Zollicoffer, had ridden into the enemy lines and had begun the conversation, only turning upon Zollicoffer when the Confederate aide rode up. Historian Stuart W. Sanders discusses the encounter at the greatest length and also quotes a subsequent account by Colonel Fry. He states that both officers rode out from their lines and that Fry initially thought Zollicoffer was a Union officer. Fry claimed to have shot Zollicoffer. Other accounts state that Fry also called to a few of his men to fire, although Fry later denied this.\n\nMany of the old Confederate flintlock weapons would not fire in the wet conditions and Zollicoffer's death caused his demoralized men to start a retreat. Thomas sent six regiments against the weak Confederate flank causing the Confederate line to collapse and retreat to Beech Grove. Crittenden removed the remaining force across the Cumberland River overnight on a small steamboat and a few barges. He left his artillery, mules, equipment and most of his food supply on the north bank. The Union had gained a significant victory and boost in morale while the Confederates had lost a brave, if unskilled, general along with about 500 men and the small army's equipment and supplies.\n\nThe Federals treated Zollicoffer's body with respect. He was embalmed by a Union surgeon and was eventually returned to Tennessee and interred in the Old City Cemetery in Nashville.\n\nZollicoffer Park, a Confederate cemetery containing a mass grave of the Confederate fallen, lies just outside Nancy. (There is also a Union cemetery located in Nancy, Mill Springs National Cemetery, the oldest of all National Cemeteries still receiving burials other than Arlington National Cemetery.) This public park receives at least two memorial events each year, one on January 19, (\"that somber sabbath morn\") and the other on Memorial Day. There have also been re-enactments of the Battle of Mill Springs.\n\n\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n"}

The song was written by Eminem and produced by Eminem along with longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, one half of the production duo Bass Brothers, and Luis Resto. It was released on October 28, 2002, as the lead single from the soundtrack. The song's lyrics explicitly sum up the background of Eminem's character in \"8 Mile\", B-Rabbit, with the first verse summing up much of the plot of the movie. The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by B-Rabbit, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers.\n\n\"Lose Yourself\" was a commercial success, becoming Eminem's first \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one single and remaining there for twelve consecutive weeks. It reached atop of the charts in nineteen other countries. \"Lose Yourself\" received acclaim from music critics, with many critics praising the song's inspiring, aggressive themes and describing it as Eminem's best work to date. Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics and the production were also praised. In many retrospective reviews and lists, critics have cited the song among Eminem's finest, as well as one of the greatest hip hop songs of all time. \n\nThe music video for the song, directed by Eminem, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. The video is a mixture of multiple scenarios, including scenes from and reminiscent of the movie \"8 Mile\", and Eminem rapping next to the \"8 Mile Rd. Mobile Court\" sign that appears on the cover of the movie's soundtrack. It received the MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film. \n\n\"Lose Yourself\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making it the first hip hop song to receive the award, and also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2004, it was one of only three hip hop songs from the 21st century to be included on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, being the highest ranked at number 166. \"Rolling Stone\" also included it on its list of the Top 50 Hip Hop Songs of All Time. \"Lose Yourself\" is certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has been downloaded 10 million times in the United States alone. \n\nEminem says that \"Lose Yourself\" was written on set, during breaks while filming \"8 Mile\". Taryn Manning, who played Jimmy's ex-girlfriend Janeane in \"8 Mile\", said in an interview with MTV, that during the filming of the movie, in any downtime, Eminem was writing and that \"you could just see him formulating stuff in his head.\" According to studio engineer Steven King, who spoke to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Eminem recorded the song in a portable studio on the set while he was on a break from shooting, using only one take for each verse. The sheet on which he wrote the song appears in \"8 Mile\" in a scene where his character is writing while riding the bus.\n\nThe official demo version of this song, titled \"Lose Yourself (Demo Version)\" with two different verses and a slightly different hook, was released on the album \"Shady XV\" November 24, 2014. A Drum & Bass remix has been made and was released on the mixtape \"Straight from the Lab\" as a European bonus track.\n\n\"Lose Yourself\" is a mid-tempo track with an urgent narrative delivery. The song's lyrics explicitly sum up the background of Eminem's character in \"8 Mile\", B-Rabbit, with the first verse summing up much of the plot of the movie. The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by B-Rabbit, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers.\n\nThe song's production incorporates piano, violins, and several other string instruments. The song is one of four new Eminem solo songs on the soundtrack, the other three being \"8 Mile\", \"Rabbit Run\" and \"Stimulate\" (included on deluxe edition only). Several critics cited this trio of songs as the best three from the soundtrack, as well as the most aggressive songs Eminem ever recorded. Piano chords described as \"instantly recognizable\" open the song. Throughout the song there is a \"tense, unrelenting guitar lick\". The song is in the key of D minor.\n\n\"Lose Yourself\" received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising the song's aggressive themes and describing it as Eminem's best work to date. Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics and the production were also praised as well. In many retrospective reviews and lists, critics have cited the song among Eminem's finest, as well as one of the best hip-hop songs of all time. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the song's production: \"The opening track and first single [from the \"8 Mile\" soundtrack] \"Lose Yourself\" is easily equaled by the title song with its layered pianos\" and he highlighted it.\n\n\"NME\" was extremely positive: \"Eminem's urgent radio hit 'Lose Yourself', you already know. It's excellent, if obviously an offcut from 'The Eminem Show', all thundering rawk guitars and Rocky-ish bassline (appropriately enough).\" RapReviews also noted: \"And as all great journeys begin with a single step, so too does Eminem with this album's opening song AND lead single entitled \"Lose Yourself\": 411 Mania praised the song: \"The album wastes no time, delivering the hit 'Lose Yourself' as the first track. The song is basically as close to a ballad as Eminem will ever get. It is a very hot, adrenaline-laced track. It also continues Eminem's recent trend of putting out tracks with more of a meaning.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Lose Yourself\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart the week of October 5, 2002, at No. 43. A week later, the single jumped to No. 18, and hit No. 1 on the week of November 9 and remained there for twelve consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by Bump, Bump, Bump by B2K and P. Diddy. The single spent 16 total weeks in the Top 10, and a total of 23 weeks in the Top 50. While in the No. 1 spot (from November 9, 2002 through January 25, 2003), \"Lose Yourself\" kept several top contenders for the No. 1 spot from ever reaching No. 1, including Jay-Z, Nelly, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, and especially Missy Elliott, whose single \"Work It\" was at No. 2 for 10 weeks. The song also topped the Pop Songs chart for 7 weeks and hit No. 4 and No. 2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rap Songs charts. The song also used some rock music origins allowing moderate success to alternative rock radio peaking No. 14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the rapper's only song to chart. It reached 4 million in sale by August 2011, and , it has sold 7.37 million copies in the U.S.\n\nIn France, it is the 53rd best-selling single of the 21st century, with 386,000 units sold . By December 2016, it had sold more than 11,590,000 units worldwide.\n\n, it had sold 10 million copies in the U.S and has now been certified diamond.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Eminem, manager Paul Rosenberg and Phillip G. Atwell, was released on October 7, 2002. It was uploaded on YouTube on August 6, 2015. The video is a mixture of several scenarios, largely including several scenes from \"8 Mile\", however it also contains scenes addressing problems the real life Eminem has addressed, as well as \"B-Rabbit\"'s difficulties, including the ostracism by rap communities towards him due to his color, and his difficult personal life.\n\nThe music video for \"Lose Yourself\" was filmed in Detroit, Michigan, and thus contains numerous shots of the city, including the Ambassador Bridge. The video is a mixture of multiple scenarios, including scenes from and reminiscent of the movie \"8 Mile\", and Eminem rapping next to the \"8 Mile Rd. Mobile Court\" sign that appears on the cover of the movie's soundtrack.\n\nIt contains scenes focusing on Rabbit's and the real life Eminem's character, for example, the difficulties he has to face while rapping, the insult and booing of crowds as he is a white rapper and the trouble he has to face due to his alcoholic mother and people he hangs out with.\n\nAt the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards it received the award for Best Video from a Film in the final year this award was given out. It also received nominations for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, Best Rap Video, and Viewer's Choice. He won a MuchMusic Video Award in 2003 for Favorite International Artist with the video for \"Lose Yourself\".\n\nA fan-edit video has been viewed over 850 million times on YouTube. The original music video was originally uploaded by Eminem, but was indirectly blocked from UMG. It later resurfaced on 2018.\n\n\"Lose Yourself\" is the most successful single of Eminem's mainstream career. Upon its release, the track was a worldwide chart success, peaking at number one on 24 national charts worldwide, these included the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it Eminem's first number-one hit in the United States. It had a 12-week run at #1 in the United States and Australia, and topped the charts in many other countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and Denmark. It debuted at number nine in Canada and moved up to #1 the following week. According to the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", \"Lose Yourself\" became the \"Longest Running Single at Number One for a Rap Song\" at 23 weeks. With over 6 million copies sold in the United States, it is Eminem's third best-selling song, just behind \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\".\n\nThe song went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Original Song (the first time a rap song ever won this award), beating other nominees like U2's \"The Hands That Built America.\" Eminem, who was not present at the award ceremony as he believed he would not win, said in a Shade 45 Behind the Boards interview with Cipha Sounds that he was actually sleeping, with cartoons on for his daughter, at the time the award was announced. This was the first time in 14 years the winner of the Best Original Song category did not perform at the ceremony. Luis Resto, one of the song's co-producers, had attended the ceremony and accepted the award on his behalf. \"He's creative, he has symphonies in his head,\" Resto said at the lectern about Eminem. Mathers denied that his absence was due to objections the show's producers had with the song's profanity. Eminem would later perform verses 1 and 3 of the uncensored song at a special performance during the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020, 17 years after he won the award, with brief moments of silence in the show's telecast. The American Film Institute later ranked it #93 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs from American Films.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards of 2004, \"Lose Yourself\" became Eminem's second career nomination for Record of the Year (following \"Without Me\"), and the first rap song ever to be nominated for Song of the Year. It won Best Male Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Song, which was a new category at the time.\n\nAt No. 166, \"Lose Yourself\" is the highest ranked of the three songs from the 21st century featured in the 2004 List of \"Rolling Stone\"s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (joining \"Stan\" at No. 290 and Outkast's \"Hey Ya!\" at #180). The magazine later ranked the song the twelfth best of the '00s decade. The song was the 51st best-selling single of the '00s decade in the United Kingdom. The song was placed at number 104 by \"Pitchfork\" on their list of \"The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s\".\n\nIn October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 57 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".

He was one of only ten recipients of the Nishan-e-Haider. He was a captain in the 27th Sindh Regiment of the Pakistan Army and later was posted to 12th NLI Regiment during the Kargil Conflict. He was killed in action during the Kargil war. For his bravery during the Kargil war, he was awarded Nishan-e-Haider, which is Pakistan's highest military gallantry award. His name is the localised form of the rank Colonel.\n\nKarnal Sher Khan was born on 1 January 1970 in Naway Kallay, Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. After completing his intermediate education at a government postgraduate college in Swabi, he first joined Pakistan Air Force (PAF) as an Airman but later joined Pakistan Army as a commissioned officer in 1992.\n\nDuring the Kargil War, he was deployed at the Gultari region. He along with his fellow soldiers established five strategic posts at height of 17,000 feet at Gultari. Indian Army launched eight attacks on their position to capture the strategic posts. However, Khan and his men were able to defend those strategic posts. On 5 July 1999, the Indian army launched another attack and surrounded his posts with two battalions. With heavy mortar fire, the Indian Army captured one of his posts. Khan personally led a successful counter-attack and was able to re-capture the lost post. Despite shortage of ammunition and men, Khan was successful in forcing the enemy to retreat. However, during the battle he was hit by machine gun fire and was killed.\n\nFollowing the end of the battle his body was found by Indian Army and taken down by Indian solders for identification. On 16 July 1999, Pakistani officials requested Indian officials to return the bodies of Captain Khan and others. They were subsequently returned by Indian officials on 18 July 1999.\n\nIndian Army Brigadier Bajwa wrote a citation for Captain Khan for his bravery, after which his body was returned to the Pakistani Army. Khan was posthumously awarded Pakistan's highest military honour, the Nishan-e-Haider.\n\nKarnal Sher Khan's home town Naway Kallay was renamed as Karnal Sher Khan Kallay. A Mausoleum was established in his home town where his body lays in rest. Every year officials from Pakistani Government, Pakistan Armed Forces and other locals visit the tomb to offer prayer.\n\nA Cadet College has been named after in the village Ismaila near the native town of Karnal Sher Khan Shaheed (NH). It is located on the main Mardan-Swabi Road, approximately midway between Mardan (23Km) and Swabi (25 Km). It can also be accessed from Grand Trunk Road through Nowshara-Mardan and from Swabi or Rashakai interchange on the Motorway (M1).\n"}
{"id": "2271583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271583", "title": "Fokker G.I", "text": "Fokker G.I\n\nThe Fokker G.I was a Dutch twin-engined heavy fighter aircraft comparable in size and role to the German Messerschmitt Bf 110. Although in production prior to World War II, its combat introduction came at a time the Netherlands were overrun by the Germans. The few G.Is that were mustered into service were able to score several victories. \nSome were captured intact after the Germans had occupied the Netherlands. The remainder of the production run was taken over by the \"Luftwaffe\" for use as trainers.\n\nThe G.I, given the nickname \"le Faucheur\" (\"The Reaper\" in French), was designed as a private venture in 1936 by Fokker chief engineer Dr. Schatzki. Intended for the role of \"jachtkruiser\", \"heavy\" fighter or air cruiser, able to gain air superiority over the battlefield as well as being a bomber destroyer, the G.1 would fulfill a role seen as important at the time, by advocates of Giulio Douhet's theories on air power. The Fokker G.I utilized a twin-engined, twin-boom layout that featured a central nacelle housing two or three crew members (a pilot, radio operator/navigator/rear gunner or a bombardier) as well as a formidable armament of twin 23 mm (.91 in) Madsen cannon and a pair of 7.9 mm (.31 in) machine guns (later eight machine guns) in the nose and one in a rear turret.\n\nBesides its main mission, the G.1 could be configured for ground attack and light bombing missions (it could carry a bomb load of one 400 kg/882 lb bomb or combinations of two 200 kg/441 lb or 10 26 kg/57 lb bombs).\n\nThe design and construction of the prototype (registered as X-2) was completed in just seven months. At its introduction at the Paris Air Show in November 1936, even before its first flight, the G.I was a sensation, appearing in a purple and yellow finish (evocative of the Spanish Republican colors, thought to be Fokker's first export customer).\n\nLike all Fokker aircraft of the period, the G.I was of mixed construction; the front of the central pod were built around a welded frame, covered with aluminium plating. The back of the central pod, however, as well as the wings, were completely constructed with wood.\n\nThe G.I prototype, powered by 485 kW (650 hp) Hispano-Suiza 14AB-02/03 engines, had its first flight at Welschap Airfield, near Eindhoven on 16 March 1937 with Karel Mares at the controls. Later, Emil Meinecke took over much of the test flights. The maiden flight went well, but a subsequent test flight in September 1937 ended with a supercharger explosion that nearly caused the loss of the prototype. The accident prompted a replacement of the Hispano-Suiza engines with 559 kW (750 hp) Pratt & Whitney SB4-G Twin Wasp Junior engines.\n\nDuring testing, the company received a contract from the Spanish Republican government for 26 G.1 \"export\" versions with Pratt & Whitney engines. Despite receiving payment, the order was destined never to be fulfilled as the Dutch government placed an embargo on the sale of military equipment to Spain. Fokker however continued building the aircraft and a story was released to the press that they were intended for Finland, hence the persistent tales about a \"Finnish\" order. To make matters more complex, Finland showed great interest in the G.I, but eventually purchased Bristol Blenheim light bombers.\n\nBesides the Dutch \"Luchtvaartafdeeling\", several foreign air forces showed an interest in the G.I. as either a fighter or dive-bomber. In order to test its potential as a dive-bomber, the G.1 prototype was fitted with hydraulically operated dive brakes under the wings. Flight tests revealed that the G.1 was capable of diving at over 644 km/h (400 mph) and demonstrated aerobatic capabilities. Swedish Air Force officer Captain Björn Bjuggren tested the G.1 in over 20 dives and reported favourably on its effectiveness as a dive bomber. Orders for G.1 Wasp aircraft came from Spain (26 ordered) and Sweden (18), while the Mercury variant was ordered by Denmark (12) together with a production license that never came to be used, and Sweden (72). Although Belgium, Finland, Turkey, Hungary and Switzerland air forces showed great interest, they never placed firm orders.\n\nThe \"Luchtvaartafdeeling\" ordered 36 G.I's with 541 kW (825 hp) Bristol Mercury VIII engines, the standard engine used by the Dutch Air Force in the Fokker D.XXI fighter, in order to equip two squadrons. Only the first four examples were built as three-seaters intended for ground-attack, with the remainder being completed as two-seat fighters. During the lead-up to hostilities, a total of 26 G.I's were operational in the 3rd \"Jachtvliegtuigafdeling\" (JaVA) at Rotterdam (Waalhaven Airfield), and 4th JaVA Fighter Group at Bergen near Alkmaar. The aircraft were actively involved in border patrols and in order to ensure neutrality, on 20 March 1940, a G.1 from 4th JaVA forced down an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley from the RAF's 77 sqn when it strayed into Dutch air space.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, 23 G.1 aircraft were serviceable while production of Spain's order of the G.1 Wasp variant continued with a dozen aircraft completed, awaiting armament.\n\nThe German invasion started with an early morning (03:50 hours) \"Luftwaffe\" attack on the Dutch airfields. While the 4th JaVA received a devastating blow, losing all but one of its aircraft, eight 3rd JaVA G.1 fighters of the Waalhaven airbase in Rotterdam, that were already fully fuelled and armed, scrambled in time and successfully engaged several German aircraft. The surviving aircraft continued to fly, but with mounting losses, bringing their numbers down to three airworthy aircraft by the end of the first day. Despite the heavy losses of 4th JaVA, some of the planes could be kept in the air by scavenging parts from various planes. In the \"Five-day War\", the available G.1 fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions, strafing advancing German infantry units, but also used to attack Junkers Ju 52/3m transports. Although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results, G.1 fighters were employed over Rotterdam and the Hague, contributing to the loss of 167 Ju 52s, scoring up to 14 confirmed aerial kills.\n\nAt the conclusion of hostilities, several G.Is were captured by the Germans, with the remainder of the Spanish order completed at the Fokker plant by mid-1941 in order for the G.1s to be assigned as fighter trainers for Bf 110 crews at Wiener Neustadt. For the next two years, \"Flugzeugführerschule\" (B) 8 flew the G.1 Wasp until attrition grounded the fleet.\n\nOn 5 May 1941, a Fokker test pilot, Hidde Leegstra, accompanied by engineer (and member of the Fokker Board of Directors) Ir. Piet Vos, managed to fly a G.1 to England. The crew's subterfuge involved acquiring additional fuel for the supposed test flight as well as ducking into clouds to deter the trailing \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft from following. After landing in England, the G.1 was conscripted by Phillips and Powis Aircraft, later Miles Aircraft. The company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber, and was interested in the G.1 wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a British climate. Despite being left outdoors for the remainder of the war, the G.1 survived only to be eventually scrapped after 1945.\n\nThere are no surviving G.Is today, although a replica has been built and is on display at the Dutch \"Nationaal Militair Museum\" (National Military Museum).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released on September 28, 2004 as the lead single from \"Encore\", and was later included on his greatest hits compilation album, \"\" (2005). The song caused controversy as its lyrics and music video parodies Michael Jackson, who was being accused of child molestation at the time. The song also pokes fun at Beavis/Cornholio, MC Hammer, Madonna, and others. It also heavily spoofs Pee-wee Herman, going as far as imitating his signature shout during the chorus and Eminem dressing like him in the video.\n\nThe song peaked at number 6\non the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States and reached number one in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway.\n\nTwo skits regarding the Michael Jackson controversy were included on \"Encore\", \"Paul (Skit)\" and \"Em Calls Paul (Skit)\". The lyrics to \"Just Lose It\" refer to Jackson's legal troubles, however he does state in his song \"... and that's not a stab at Michael, That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho...\" At the beginning of the song there is a lyrical excerpt from Eminem's 2002 single \"Without Me\" about how \"Shady's back\". The line \"Snap back to reality. Look! It's B. Rabbit\" and \"You signed me up to battle\" refers to \"Lose Yourself\" and Eminem's character in the movie \"8 Mile\". In the second verse of the song there is a line \"So fellas, fellas...\" which is a reference to Sir Mix-a-Lot's song \"Baby Got Back\". The line \"Girl you know you're my world,\" from the chorus, is a reference to the chorus of his song \"Superman\" from his album \"The Eminem Show\".\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it too similar to Eminem's previous work. AllMusic highlighted the song in a review of the album. Pitchfork was also positive: \"'Just Lose It' is still most notable for dancing with paedo and homoerotic imagery: It's the one track here that seems as potentially multilayered as the best of \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", yet it's still more curio than anything else.\" \"NME\" wrote: \"Em (is) reduced to making funny noises to keep things interesting.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\", however, felt mixed: \"First [on the album] came the sarcastically bouncy \"Just Lose It\", a lazy retread of earlier hits that, with its easy-target references to Michael Jackson, made Eminem appear to be the one who'd actually lost it.\" J-23 panned the song and called it \"by far the worst song Eminem or Dr. Dre has ever made. It really seems like their object here was to make the worst song possible. The interlude leading into it is damn hilarious though.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"the album's hilarious slap at celebrity voyeurism, with Eminem himself a prominent target.\"\n\nRapReviews argued that it isn't \"dropping any jaws or widening any eyes.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described this song as \"dance-music dis.\" In a review praising \"Encore\"'s \"edginess,\" Steve Jones of USA Today cited the song's mocking of the Michael Jackson child-molestation scandal. Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\", however, wrote: \"[Eminem's] plan appears to involve belching and making fart noises, which, with the best will in the world, won't suffice.\" Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the song \"unfolds as a series of puzzlingly unfunny jokes.\" \"Stylus Magazine\" was negative as well, calling it \"Em’s brand new tendency to bite himself.\" \"The Austin Chronicle\" was a bit negative as well: \"Where 2002 smash 'Without Me' was bitingly clever, \"Encore\"s carbon copy 'Just Lose It' is puerile and embarrassing, even though he quotes \"Beavis and Butt-head\" and does a wicked Pee-wee Herman.\" \"Slant Magazine\" said that the song \"was so derivative that it had to be a joke—even the song’s title seemed to mock the Academy Award-winning \"8 Mile\" theme song that elevated the Great White Rapper to a whole new level of acceptance (as if he hadn’t already transcended nearly every other boundary in pop culture). Not only is 'Just Lose It' the worst song on \"Encore\", it’s easily one of the most annoying songs of the year (credit Em’s incessant Pee Wee Herman impersonations and tired attacks on Michael Jackson).\"\n\nThe video contains a parody of a rap battle scene from \"8 Mile\" in which it is Eminem, as B-Rabbit, versus Eminem, as Slim Shady. It also contains several scenes where Eminem is walking down the streets naked. As he is doing this, Dr. Dre is seen driving next to him, looking disgusted. For the music video, the lyrics were edited slightly, notably the phrase \"shake that ass\", becoming the less provocative \"shake that thing\". Other changes include the muting of some parts of the second verse, and the phrase \"butt naked\" becoming \"buck naked\". Such examples of parodies that are included in this video are Michael Jackson, MC Hammer and his hit single \"U Can't Touch This\", Pee-wee Herman, Madonna, Blink 182 and the music video for \"What's My Age Again\", and the movie \"Bad Santa\", by displaying Eminem as a \"mall santa\", and even going so far to include Tony Cox, the actor who played the elf from the actual movie, as Eminem's helper. Some of the celebrities who appeared in this music video were Paris Hilton, Monica Parales, Erik Estrada, Alyson Stoner, BooBoo Stewart, Omar Benson Miller, De'Angelo Wilson, Mekhi Phifer and Dr. Dre. The video was later nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video, but lost to Ludacris' \"Number One Spot\". Much Music's 50 Most Controversial Videos ranked it #1 for its jokes on famous people.\n\nThe music video for \"Just Lose It\" generated controversy by parodying singer Michael Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and an incident in 1984 when Jackson's hair caught fire whilst filming a Pepsi commercial. \n\nA week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson called into Steve Harvey's radio show to report his displeasure with the video. \"I am very angry at Eminem's depiction of me in his video,\" Jackson said in the interview. \"I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof, but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive.\" Jackson continued: \"I've admired Eminem as an artist, and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large.\" Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including Stevie Wonder, who called it \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\", and Harvey, who declared, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back.\" The video was banned on the BET channel, after complaints from Benzino and others (but was later reinstated, as critics of the ban argued that Nelly's \"Tip Drill\" video which has been alleged to be misogynistic was aired; both were only seen on \"\"). However MTV did not drop it, and the video became one of the most requested on the channel.\n\n\n\n"}

While Terry's trademark look was her blonde hair, she was actually a brunette, and put on her first blonde wig in \"Hearts Are Trumps\" (1920) to look different from Francelia Billington, the other actress in the film. Terry played several different characters in the 1916 anti-war film \"Civilization\", co-directed by Thomas H. Ince and Reginald Barker. Alice wore the blonde wig again in her most acclaimed role as \"Marguerite\" in film \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" (1921), and kept the wig for any future roles. In 1925 her husband Rex Ingram co-directed \"\", filming parts of it in Italy. The two decided to move to the French Riviera, where they set up a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy for MGM and others. In 1933, Terry made her last film appearance in \"Baroud\", which she also co-directed with husband.\n\nBorn in Vincennes, Indiana, on July 29, 1900, she made her film debut in 1916 in \"Not My Sister\", opposite Bessie Barriscale and William Desmond Taylor.\n\nTerry started in films as an extra during her mid-teens. For two years she worked in cutting rooms at Famous-Players-Lasky. This work would help her later on when she worked with her husband.\n\nAlice Terry was married to Rex Ingram, a prominent director. One of her biggest problems in her career was being the leading lady in movies directed by her husband. Her roles in films directed by her husband left her passive and unmemorable. Rex Ingram also hired male stars that further outshone her in movies such as \"The Conquering Power\" (1921), \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922) and others. One fan magazine writer described Alice as \"pliant clay\" or easily manipulated on screen.\nIn 1924 and 1925 the marriage between Terry and Ingram was in jeopardy, and in that time period she worked under other directors. During this time period Alice worked on five movies, but her roles particularly in \"Any Woman\" (1925) and \"Sackcloth and Scarlet\" (1925), both by Paramount Pictures, proved that Alice was a legitimate star away from her husband. When they got back together, Terry took on a more behind-the-scenes role.\n\nAlice's work at Famous-Players-Lasky helped her in ways that were not commonly known to the public. Ingram would often get too moody to work while directing movies so Terry would take over. She was a competent film editor and learned how to direct from a master. When Ingram went to produce his last film, and only talkie, \"Baroud\" (1933), Alice helped so much that she was named co-director and she directed all the scenes Ingram appeared in. Baroud highlighted Alice's ability as an all around filmmaker but she never took that further.\n\nTerry worked with Ramón Novarro, a popular a film star from Mexico who drew in audiences as a \"Latin lover\", and became known as a sex symbol after the death of Rudolph Valentino. Many have said that Novarro outdid Terry in many films such as \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922), \"The Arab\" (1924) and others; but this didn't hinder their friendship.\n\nIn 1921, she married director Rex Ingram during production of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922), which he directed and in which she appeared as Princess Flavia. The couple sneaked away over one weekend, were married in Pasadena, and returned to work promptly the following Monday.\n\nIn 1923 Terry and Ingram decided to move to the French Riviera. They formed a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy for MGM and others.\n\nDuring the making of \"The Arab\" (1924) in Tunisia, they met a street child named Kada-Abd-el-Kader, whom they adopted upon learning that he was an orphan. Allegedly, el-Kader misrepresented his age to make himself seem younger to his adoptive parents.\n\nAlice Terry was known for being open minded and acted as a cover for Ramón Novarro's sexuality. In the 1930s she went with Novarro, Barry Norton, and other homosexual actors to Hollywood nightspots to act as a cover, which received backlash in the magazine \"The Hollywood Reporter\".\n\nWhen Ingram decided to return to Los Angeles he asked Terry to find a home by a river. One night when Terry was drinking with friends she instructed the cab to pull over so she could throw up. When Terry was done, she looked up and saw a property in Studio City on the Los Angeles River and decided that this was the place where her new home with Rex would be.\n\nOnce Terry and Ingram moved back to the United States they started having problems with their adopted son, Kada-Abd-el-Kader. He \"began associating with fast women and fast cars throughout the San Fernando Valley.\" Terry and Ingram sent him back to Morocco \"to finish school.\" Kada-Abd-el-Kader never went back to school, but he later became a tourist guide in Morocco and Algiers. El-Kader would always tell tourists that he was the adopted son of Rex Ingram and Alice Terry.\n\nTerry and Ingram retired in the 1930s and took up painting. When Ingram died in 1950, Terry invited four of his mistresses to his funeral. When Alice was asked how she could invite four of his mistresses to the post-funeral party said: \"Who cares, I'm the only one that can call herself Mrs. Rex Ingram.\"\n\nAfter Ingram's death Terry's sister Edna moved into the property on Kelsey Street and controlled Alice's life. Alice had a lover named Gerald Fielding who wanted to move in with Alice but Edna forbade it. It is speculated that Edna was jealous of Alice, Edna started as an extra as movies just like her sister, but then married a financial advisor and she stopped acting altogether.\n\nTerry was still active in the 1970s. She loved hosting Sunday afternoon parties and going out to dinner in extravagant, floor length mink coats. She was proud of her appearance and wanted to make sure all other women were envious.\n\nAlzheimer's put a stop to Terry's parties and fun and she eventually died in a Burbank, California, hospital on December 22, 1987. Her grave is located in the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Alice Terry has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6628 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n"}

This 2005 edition was printed as \"The Bible (Penguin Classics)\" in 2006. The editor is David Norton, Reader in English at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Norton is author of \"A History of the Bible as Literature\" (1993) revised and condensed as \"A History of the English Bible as Literature\" (2000). He wrote \"A Textual History of the King James Bible\" as a companion volume to the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible.\n\nA previous edition of the KJV called the Cambridge Paragraph Bible was published in 1873. That volume was edited by F.H.A. Scrivener, one of the translators of the English Revised Version and a noted scholar of the text of the Bible. For a long time it was perhaps best known as the KJV text in the standard reference work \"The New Testament Octapla\" edited by Luther Weigle, chairman of the translation committee that produced the Revised Standard Version. But more recently, the publisher Zondervan has attempted a revival of Scrivener's text by conforming all its newer editions of the KJV to it, such as its Zondervan KJV Study Bible. And the popular Logos Bible Software includes an electronic text of the \"Cambridge Paragraph Bible\" as of certain editions of version 3 of its Bible program.\n\nConsiderable honour is due to Scrivener for his work on the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible. Nevertheless, there are some instances of misrepresentation of the original KJV text in Scrivener's work, since, as Norton suggests, he felt himself entitled to \"correct\" what the translators wrote. For example,\n\n\nAlthough Scrivener's text has been highly regarded since its appearance, it has not had a major influence on current editions of the KJV, which are essentially reprints of the 1769 Oxford edition by Benjamin Blayney. Therefore, current KJV printings feature certain post-1611-edition editorial changes, 18th century spelling, an enhanced system of \"supplied words\" (the words printed in italics as having no equivalent in the original Biblical texts but added for clarity), and emended punctuation.\n\nIn his \"Textual History,\" Prof. Norton describes the process by which Cambridge University Press commissioned the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible. The beginning dates back to 1994, when the press' Bible Publishing Manager needed to decide on any changes or corrections that would have to be made to the KJV text published by Cambridge, given that the film from which the press printed its text was becoming worn and in need of replacement. Two possibilities that emerged were to use Scrivener's text or to simply adopt Cambridge's own Concord KJV edition as the basis; however, neither gave exactly the translator's text or used consistent modern spelling. Cambridge eventually chose a different option, to have the KJV edited afresh. This also provided the opportunity to give the KJV a new formatting, one which follows the path broken by Scrivener in the first Cambridge Paragraph Bible but is by no means bound to his decisions regarding presentation; instead, the formatting of the volume has been completely reworked by Norton.\n\nUsing such sources as the first edition published in 1611, a manuscript preserved from the first stage of the KJV men's work (known as Lambeth Palace MS 98), and a complete Bishops' Bible annotated by them (known as Bodleian Library Bibl. Eng. 1602 b. 1), Norton re-edited the KJV. His edition:\n\n\nAt the same time, Norton's recension is for the most part quite conservative. For example, no readings are introduced from the above-mentioned manuscripts that occur only in them, though the annotations they contain are used to support 1611 first edition readings as demonstrating a deliberate decision by the original translators that has been overruled by subsequent hands. Norton writes in the introduction, \"Except where there are good reasons to think that the first edition does not represent the readings the translators decided on, first edition readings are restored\" (2005, p. ix). Also, other than the quotation marks, the punctuation—where changed from that of the current standard KJV text—mainly provides a simple restoration of 1611's punctuation.\n\nOne of the more radical changes is to eliminate the main text's differentiation of the \"supplied words\" usually printed in italics in current KJVs. (Such words are, however, intentionally retained in the marginal notes.) Norton points out that the original edition's supplied words, printed in Roman type in 1611 as opposed to the black-letter of the main text, were very inadequately marked; although many subsequent editors have tried to revise them (especially Scrivener), Norton feels that they are misunderstood by most readers and are ineffective even for those who know their purpose.\n\n\n"}

These devices are capable of multiplexing many wavelengths into a single optical fiber, thereby increasing the transmission capacity of optical networks considerably.\n\nThe devices are based on a fundamental principle of optics that light waves of different wavelengths do not interfere linearly with each other. This means that, if each channel in an optical communication network makes use of light of a slightly different wavelength, then the light from many of these channels can be carried by a single optical fiber with negligible crosstalk between the channels. The AWGs are used to multiplex channels of several wavelengths onto a single optical fiber at the transmission end and are also used as demultiplexers to retrieve individual channels of different wavelengths at the receiving end of an optical communication network.\n\nConventional silica-based AWGs schematically shown in the above figure, are planar lightwave circuits fabricated by depositing doped and undoped layers of silica on a silicon substrate. The AWGs consist of a number of input \"(1)\" / output \"(5)\" couplers, a free space propagation region \"(2)\" and \"(4)\" and the grating waveguides \"(3)\". The grating consists of many waveguides with a constant length increment (ΔL). Light is coupled into the device via an optical fiber \"(1)\" connected to the input port. Light diffracting out of the input waveguide at the coupler/slab interface propagates through the free-space region \"(2)\" and illuminates the grating with a Gaussian distribution. Each wavelength of light coupled to the grating waveguides \"(3)\" undergoes a constant change of phase attributed to the constant length increment in grating waveguides. Light diffracted from each waveguide of the grating interferes constructively and gets refocused at the output waveguides \"(5)\", with the spatial position, the output channels, being wavelength dependent on the array phase shift.\n\n"}

His father was Squadron-Leader Jeremy Howard-Williams DFC, who was a night fighter pilot during World War II before joining Fighter Interception Unit. His paternal grandfather, Air Commodore E. L. Howard-Williams was a major in the army, before joining the fledgling Royal Flying Corps, the precursor to the RAF. His uncle, Wing Commander Peter Howard-Williams DFC was in 19 Squadron flying out of Duxford during 1940 and flew in The Battle of Britain, and therefore was one of The Few.\n\nHis maternal grandfather was Air Vice-Marshal F. F. Inglis CB CBE and head of RAF Intelligence during WW2 and on Adolf Hitler's hit list for after the war should Germany have won. He was sent to America by Winston Churchill where he successfully persuaded President Franklin D. Roosevelt to direct the American war against Germany rather than Japan.\n\nAir Marshal Sir Victor Goddard, a Great-Uncle by marriage, was said by some to be the person who suggested to Winston Churchill the idea of sending the little ships over to Dunkirk to pick up the remnants of the British Army. Air-Commodore Peter Helmore (son of Air Commodore William Helmore) was an uncle by marriage. Amongst his non-RAF ancestry, there is his great-uncle Lt John Inglis who lost his life at the Battle of Loos, Vermilles and Hill 70 in 1915.\n\nAnthony is directly descended from the great engineer Robert Napier of the Napier-Railton cars and more distantly related to another Robert Napier (shipbuilder), the man to whom Samuel Cunard turned, to install engines into his first ships such as the \"Britannia\"-class steamships. Further, he is directly descended from Col Sir John Inglis who commanded the garrison during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857 and General Sir Charles James Napier, famous for conquering the Sindh province in present-day Pakistan. The statue in the south-west corner of Trafalgar Square is of him. He continues the association with the name Napier as he has given his son Alexander, Napier as his middle name.\n\nHe was first educated at Freston Lodge School in Sevenoaks, where at the age of 6 he first conducted. On leaving Freston Lodge he boarded at Hordle House on the south coast of England in the village of Milford on Sea. On leaving there he gained a scholarship to Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Academically, he was not gifted and he left before failing his A Levels (having achieved four O Levels including music) and entered the Royal College of Music at an early age.\n\nOn leaving the college, he did a number of music jobs which included being on the music staff for some of Ken Russell's films: \"Lisztomania\" and \"Mahler\", plus singing on the cult film \"The Wicker Man\"; his is the high tenor heard in the pub scene. He played piano in the West End of London working his way up to being the music director for shows such as \"My Fair Lady\" with Anna Neagle and Tony Britton directed by the lyricist of the show Alan Jay Lerner; \"Oliver!\" with Ron Moody, the last time he reprised his role; \"The Two Ronnies\" with Barker and Corbett; and \"Irene\" with Jon Pertwee. Having conducted a season at the London Palladium he decided to pursue his original career: that of a classical conductor.\n\nHe has been described as \"one of Britain's most popular conductors\" and leads a busy international conducting career, appearing with some of the greatest orchestras in concert halls from Sydney via Tokyo, to the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, and recording studios around the world. These include the four main London independent orchestras: London Symphony Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra, all the British independent and most BBC orchestras, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra and Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. He is currently music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in London, the Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins and is music consultant for \"The Phantom of the Opera\" at Her Majesty's Theatre. For 15 years he was well known in the UK for his conducting of Classical Spectacular, and in Japan, his series of contemporary anime recordings with the Warsaw Philharmonic regularly featured in the top classical 10. In the world of opera, he has conducted at the Gothenburg opera house. In ballet, he has conducted all three Tchaikovsky ballets for Birmingham Royal Ballet and English National Ballet, and he has been featured more times at London's Royal Albert Hall than anyone else in the building's history.\n\nHe has conducted six royal concerts: a dance gala with the Royal Ballet Sinfonia in the presence of Diana, Princess of Wales, two concerts with the Royal Philharmonic in the presence of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the naming ceremony for the world's largest liner, the ; and two with the London Philharmonic in the presence of the Prince of Wales in aid of farmers and the naming ceremony for Cunard Line's liner, the . The sixth was for the naming ceremony of the newest Cunard liner the in the presence of the Queen.\n\nHis studio, TV and concert recordings have been broadcast in the UK, Australia, Scandinavia, Europe and the Far East. He has made recent DVD recordings with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and two with Katherine Jenkins and the National Symphony plus CD recordings with: London Symphony (1993 Grammy nominated), London Philharmonic, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), Philharmonia, Israel Philharmonic, Warsaw Philharmonic, London Mozart Players, Slovak Philharmonic, Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (Rome), Bournemouth Symphony, Cracow Radio Symphony, Hong Kong Sinfonietta, Prague Sinfonia, Netherlands Radio Symphony.

It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year on Easter Monday.\n\nIt is the Irish equivalent of the Grand National, and it is held during Fairyhouse's Easter Festival meeting.\n\nThe event was established in 1870, and the inaugural running was won by a horse called Sir Robert Peel. The race took place at its present venue, and the winner's prize money was 167 sovereigns. In the early part of its history it was often won by horses trained at the Curragh, and there were ten such winners by 1882. The Easter Monday fixture regularly attracted racegoers from Dublin, and it became known as the Dubs' Day Out.\n\nSeveral winners of the Irish Grand National have also won its English counterpart at Aintree, but none in the same year. The first to complete the double was Ascetic's Silver, the winner of the latter version in 1906. The feat has been achieved more recently by Rhyme 'n' Reason, Bobbyjo and Numbersixvalverde.

It is also responsible for the accreditation of educational and training programs, delegating this responsibility to licensed member institutions.\n\nProfessional engineering institutions in the UK began in 1818 with the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers. The IMechE was formed next in 1847. The IEE was formed in 1871. These three are known as the \"Big Three\" institutions since together they represent 80% of registered UK engineers.\n\nThe Joint Council of Engineering Institutions was formed in 1964, which later became the Council of Engineering Institutions (CEI) in November 1965, which had a royal charter. This provided all the main functions that the EngC now provides, but was more ineffectual. Around this time, 33% of the UK's GDP was in manufacturing, lowering to 29% in the early 1970s.\n\nA royal commission, from the committee of inquiry into the engineering profession, chaired by Sir Monty Finniston, was set up in 1977. It looked at the formation and registration of engineers, producing the Finniston Report - \"Engineering our Future\" in 1980. Engineering institutions thought they may have lost their autonomy. There was also the possibility of statutory licensing (direct government control) of engineers, as other professional practitioners such as doctors, but the work of engineers is more confined to work with other engineering companies, providing a nominal level of inherent professional self-regulation against misconduct. Keith Joseph at the DTI chose not to have a statutory body, but have a royal charter.\n\nFrom its recommendations, the Engineering Council was established in 1981, watching over 54 separate institutions. It gained a royal charter on 27 November 1981. The first chairman was Sir Kenneth Corfield, followed by Francis Tombs, Baron Tombs in 1985, Sir William Barlow in 1988, Sir John Fairclough in 1991, Dr. Alan Rudge in 1996 and Dr. Robert Hawley in 1999.\n\nIt formed the WISE Campaign in 1983 to encourage women to become engineers. In 1996, the diamond logo was replaced by a circle.\n\nEngineering Council is recognized by the British Government as the national representative body of the engineering profession in the United Kingdom, working in partnership with other engineering institutions. The Engineering Council regulates the professions of chartered engineer, incorporated engineer and engineering technician in the UK.\nThese professional titles are recognized in Europe with the Directive 2005/36.\n\nUK legislation is generally 'permissive' and, as such, the title \"engineer\" is not protected by law therefore anyone can call themselves an \"engineer\" or \"professional engineer\" or \"registered engineer\" and many semi-skilled and unskilled trades adopt this title. However the 'professional' titles awarded by the Engineering Council are protected by law. Registration as a chartered and incorporated engineers or as engineering technicians is voluntary and candidates are required to demonstrate a high standard of professional competence acquired through education, training and responsible experience in order to register. There are four categories of registration:\n\n\nAssessment for registration is typically carried out on Engineering Council's behalf by a licensed member institution.\n\nThe Engineering Technician (EngTech) may obtain the Licentiateship (with post nominals LCGI), a City and Guilds award comparable to a level 4 qualification.\nThe Incorporated Engineer (IEng) may obtain the Graduateship (GCGI) in engineering, comparable to a level 6 qualification.\nThe Chartered Engineer (CEng) may obtain the Membership (MCGI) in engineering, comparable to a level 7 qualification.\n\n\nEngineering Council is a \"designated authority\" under the implementing regulations for Directive 2005/36/EC. It is a member of the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI).\nEngineering Council has relationships with many similar organizations worldwide.\nIt has responsibility for the UK sections of two international registers:\n\n\nEuropean Engineer registration entitles the holder to use the European-style prefix title EurIng; International Professional Engineer registration entitles the holder to use the suffix IntPE (UK). The qualifications required for international registration are similar to those required for CEng registration.\n\n"}

The Vice President currently holds office at the Quezon City Reception House in Quezon City. Previously, the Vice President of the Philippines held office at the Coconut Palace (located in the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex), the Philippine National Bank Financial Center, and the Philippine International Convention Center (also located in the CCP Complex), all in Pasay, Metro Manila.\n\nThe current office of the Vice President was re-established under the 1987 Constitution, bearing similarities with the office as created in the 1935 Constitution that was abolished by the Marcos regime.\n\nLeni Robredo from Camarines Sur assumed the office on June 30, 2016 as the 14th and current vice president.\n\nThe official title of the office in Filipino is \"Pangalawang Pangulo,\" although \"Bise Presidente,\" derived from Spanish, is the usual title used in some of the major Philippine languages, such as Cebuano and Hiligaynon language.\n\nThe text of the 1987 Constitution refers to the person and office of the \"Vice-President,\" with a hyphen connecting the two words. However, the person and office is usually referred to today without the hyphen, as the \"Vice President.\"\n\nThe first known vice president claiming to be part of a government was Mariano Trías, whose term started on March 22, 1897. He was elected during the elections of the Tejeros Convention, and was later elected vice president of the Supreme Council that oversaw negotiations for the Biak na Bato pact in 1897. This Supreme Council had no sovereignty, did not govern any state, and was just used for bargaining with the Spanish. This council was replaced later, with no such position existing during the country's declaration of independence in 1898, which had a dictatorial government. Officially, the country's first actual republic was founded in 1899, and it too had no vice president. Trias instead served in the cabinets of Apolinario Mabini and Pedro Paterno, as finance minister and war minister, respectively. Trias is not considered a Philippine Vice President as the Supreme Council did not proclaim any sovereign state.\n\nThe 1935 Constitution of the Philippines established the position of Vice President, and may be appointed by the President to a cabinet position. The first person elected to the position of Vice President under the constitution was Sergio Osmeña. Elected together with Manuel L. Quezon in the first Philippine national elections, Osmeña was given the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio with inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in November 1935. Prior to independence in 1946, that cabinet portfolio was Secretary of Public Instruction, which had once been reserved only for the Vice Governor-General (an American). Vice President Osmeña held that position from 1935–1939, and a similar portfolio in the War Cabinet during World War II.\n\nAfter independence, the highest-ranking cabinet position became that of Secretary of Foreign Affairs (it is still the highest-ranking cabinet portfolio in official protocol to this day), which was given to Vice President Elpidio Quirino. Vice President Fernando Lopez declined the Foreign Affairs portfolio when he became Quirino's Vice President in 1949. However, Vice Presidents Carlos P. Garcia and Emmanuel Pelaez also held the Foreign Affairs portfolio, a tradition revived in the Fifth Republic, with Vice Presidents Salvador Laurel and Teofisto Guingona, Jr. holding the Foreign Affairs portfolio. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo served as Secretary of Social Welfare and Development. Other Cabinet positions with no Secretary title was given to Joseph Estrada as Chairman of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission and Noli de Castro as Chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.\n\nAmong the Vice Presidents of the Third Republic, Diosdado Macapagal alone was not given any cabinet position, since he was the first elected Vice-President that did not originate from the same party as the incumbent. Arturo Tolentino was officially proclaimed Vice President-elect by the Regular Batasang Pambansa in 1986. He took his oath as Vice President on February 16, 1986 before Chief Justice Ramon Aquino but because of popular belief that the elections had been rigged, he never actually served out his term as Vice President. Within a week after Tolentino's oath, the People Power Revolution resulted in the collapse of the Marcos regime. On February 25, 1986 Corazon Aquino and Salvador H. Laurel were sworn in as President and Vice President.\n\nThe office of Vice President was abolished and not included in the original version of the 1973 Constitution. It was, however, reinstated in subsequent amendments, just before the snap elections in 1986 that led to the People Power Revolution that installed Corazon Aquino into the Presidency.\n\nArticle 7, Section 3 of the Constitution mandates that the Vice President must bear the same qualifications as the President which means he must be:\n\nThe Vice President is elected in the same manner as, but separately from, the President. Both the President and the Vice President are elected by direct plurality vote where the candidate who garners the highest number of votes, whether a majority or not, wins the election. While candidates usually run in tandem for the offices of President and Vice President, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as President and Vice President.\n\nThe Vice President is barred from serving more than two consecutive terms.\n\nThe Vice President is first in the presidential line of succession. The Constitution provides several circumstances where the Vice President (or the Vice President-elect) shall assume the Presidency or serve as acting President.\nThere has been four cases where the Vice President has assumed the Presidency, three of which because of the President's death, and one because of the President's resignation:\n\nThe Vice President is paid ₱353,476 (approximately US$7,080) per month and ₱ 4,241,640 per annum as of July 1, 2016 by virtue of Executive Order No. 201 series of 2016 as authorized by Congressional Joint Resolution No. 4 series. Prior to the raise, the monthly salary was around ₱100,000.\n\nThe salary of the Vice President is determined by Congress and the pay cannot be reduced during his tenure. Any increase approved during his tenure can only take effect after such tenure.\n\nHistorically, the Vice President was not given an official residence. However, the Vice President also held office along with the President at the Executive Building (now Kalayaan Hall) in the complex of Malacañang Palace from 1935 until 1972, when the position was abolished under martial law and the 1973 Constitution. When the position was reinstated, Vice President Salvador H. Laurel held office at the former Legislative Building on Padre Burgos Avenue, Manila, until the building became the National Museum of Fine Arts of the National Museum of the Philippines. The Vice President's office was transferred to the Philippine International Convention Center, and again to the PNB Financial Center, both in Pasay, Metro Manila in 2005. In 2011, the Coconut Palace also in Pasay was designated as the principal workplace of the Vice President of the Philippines. Beginning June 30, 2016, the office was transferred to the Quezon City Reception House in Quezon City.\n\nThe Vice President of the Philippines generally rides in a Mercedes Benz W140 S-Class, backed up by personnel from the Presidential Security Group.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2271641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271641", "title": "Rotherham Central station", "text": "Rotherham Central station\n\nRotherham Central railway station is in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. The station was originally named \"Rotherham\", becoming \"Rotherham and Masborough\" in January 1889 and finally \"Rotherham Central\" on 25 September 1950. (The town's other station was at one time known as \"Masbrough and Rotherham\".)\nRotherham Central is the only railway station in Rotherham since the closure of , in 1988. However, it has retained its \"Central\" suffix, like Lincoln Central railway station.\n\nThis is the fourth station to be built, within the town centre, on the line from . The first, a single platform terminus was built on what became the coal yard by the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR). Today this approximates to the land off Brinsworth Street below the bridge which carries the Inner Relief Road over the railway. The SYR could not gain permission to pass below the already built line of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway, opened in 1838. A few years later and following amalgamation into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR), a scheme was developed to fill the South Yorkshire Navigation, a canal already owned by that railway company and divert its course into the nearby River Don. As the Navigation already passed below the Sheffield and Rotherham line this would solve the problem, although until recent years the line was prone to flooding. The SYR already had a single line from Mexborough, on its Barnsley to Doncaster line, towards Rotherham, running alongside the canal but only as far as the pottery and brickworks at Kilnhurst, leaving a gap of almost between. When the through line was completed a new, although temporary Rotherham station was built in the cut with access from the road above named \"Amen Corner\". This served the town from 1 August 1868. The line between Rotherham and Mexborough opened for goods traffic on 13 March 1871; passenger services began on 3 April 1871 but these continued to use the temporary station until the permanent Rotherham Central station was opened on 1 February 1874. This was an elongated affair with staggered platforms and a large stone main building opposite the \"Statutes Fair Ground\", with access from both Main Street, at the Sheffield end, and College Road, at the Doncaster end. In January 1889 this station was renamed Rotherham and Masborough. This station came under the ownership of the Great Central Railway (GCR) when the MS&LR changed its name in anticipation of its extension to London (Marylebone station), in 1897. The station was served by Sheffield Victoria - local trains and others ranging from the north east to the south coast, the Great Central Railway being involved in many operations jointly with other companies. The GCR amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at the start of 1923; the LNER was itself nationalised at the start of 1948, becoming part of the newly formed British Railways (BR). Following this, Rotherham and Masborough was renamed Rotherham Central on 25 September 1950. Its last main line train, a throw-back to these pre-First World War One joint operations, being the Newcastle to Bournemouth express. This station was closed on 5 September 1966 and soon demolished.\n\nWith the rationalisation of railways in the area in full swing plans to concentrate Sheffield's train services at Sheffield Midland station led to the building of a major new junction between the lines of the former Great Central and the Midland Railway at Aldwarke Junction north of Rotherham, allowing Sheffield - Doncaster trains to be routed onto the Midland line to Sheffield Midland station via Rotherham Masborough. With only one station in town, eventually, \"Masborough\" was dropped from the name of the remaining station.\nRotherham Masborough was located almost half-a-mile away from Rotherham town centre and by the 1980s this was judged to be hindering the use of train services from the town.\n\nIn order to provide a more convenient service, a single line link was constructed from the Midland Line at Holmes Junction, on the Sheffield side of Masborough station, to pass below the Midland line and join the Great Central south of the planned new station. This was known as \"The Holmes Chord\".\n\nThe first sod of earth to be cut on the site of the new station was ceremonially cut by the Mayor of Rotherham, Councillor J. L. Skelton on Tuesday, 8 July 1986. He also unveiled a plaque to commemorate the event. On Wednesday, 8 April 1987 the Chairman of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority, Councillor Jack Meredith ceremonially fixed the last rail clip. The new Rotherham Central station was opened to passengers on 11 May 1987, is situated by the College Road bridge, near the town centre, the Doncaster-bound platform on the site of the 1871 platform but the Sheffield - bound platform is now opposite. The station buildings, of modern brick construction are at road level, with the entrance way through the ticket office; the platforms are approached by ramps. The whole scheme, the station and the Holmes Chord, cost £2,400,000, the P.T.E. funding the scheme with a contribution from Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council to enhance platform shelter facilities. A grant for half the cost was obtained from the European Regional Development Fund. After just six months, the passenger usage was recorded as being up by 120% compared with the old Masborough station for the same period of 1986.\n\nThe official opening date was set for 2 June, however this was postponed due to expected picketing by members of the National Union of Railwaymen demonstrating against the cutting of 11 jobs with the transfer of staff from Masborough and the concerns over the staff reduction on the platform at the new station, this being reduced to one person.\n\nRotherham Masborough remained for the three per day Sheffield-York trains having regained its suffix, until its closure in 1988, when all services were concentrated on Central station. Clearly, this time the will for rationalising station names had vanished, because the sole remaining Rotherham station still retains its suffix \"Central\".\n\nIt was announced by Northern that in 2010 the station would undergo a £8.5 million refurbishment, as part of the \"Rotherham Renaissance\" plans for the regeneration of the town. The 1980s station buildings and ramps would be replaced by a new travel centre, along with new platform canopies, lifts and CCTV. As part of this the car park would also be redesigned. A temporary station entrance would be constructed for passenger use while the buildings were replaced. \nWork on the project commenced on Monday, 22 February 2010 with a temporary station entrance being constructed, expected to come into operation during March. The temporary station opened on Friday 9 July and the old travel centre demolished a month later. After being dogged by delays, the new station buildings and platforms opened for public use on Friday 24 February 2012.\n\nRotherham Central Station is now served by the Sheffield Supertram Tram-Train, with services running 3 times per hour between Rotherham Parkgate and Sheffield Cathedral stops. The service opened on 25 October 2018, and calls at its own low-level platforms to the south of the National Rail platforms, however they are directly connected to one another by a ramp.\n\nCurrently the station has a half-hourly service on weekdays to Doncaster (with alternate trains extended through to Adwick) and hourly to Wakefield and , along with three trains per hour to Meadowhall and Sheffield. Three trains per day operate to York via the Dearne Valley Line. There are also three tram-trains an hour towards Rotherham Parkgate and towards Sheffield Cathedral.\n\nOn Sundays, the station is served by an hourly service to Doncaster, a train every two hours to Leeds, two trains per day to York and either one or two trains per hour to Sheffield.\n\nTransPennine Express operates a very limited service from the station. There is one train per day westbound from to and Manchester in the morning, Monday to Saturday. There are no eastbound or evening services which call at the station.\n\nThe line through Rotherham Masborough railway station survives, and is used by fast passenger services between Sheffield and Leeds/York to bypass Rotherham Central station. Freight services using the \"Old Road\", the original North Midland Railway line to reach Chesterfield, avoiding Sheffield also traverse this route.\n\nThe 2019 United Kingdom floods caused severe disruption to train and tram-train services running through the station, as the station and lines in the area were flooded. The tram-train service, and the Sheffield to Leeds (via Moorthorpe) route were both suspended.\n"}
{"id": "2271642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271642", "title": "Regional road (Ireland)", "text": "Regional road (Ireland)\n\nA regional road () in Ireland is a class of road not forming a major route (such as a national primary road or national secondary road), but nevertheless forming a link in the national route network. There are over 11,600 kilometres of regional roads. Regional roads are numbered with three-digit route numbers, prefixed by \"R\" (e.g. R105).\n\nUntil 1977, classified roads in Ireland were designated with one of two prefixes: \"T\" for Trunk Roads and \"L\" for Link Roads. The Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act authorised the designation of roads as National roads: in 1977, twenty-five National Primary roads (N1-N25) and thirty-three National Secondary roads (N51-N83) were initially designated under Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 164/1977.\n\nMany of the remaining classified roads became Regional roads (formally authorised under the Roads Act 1993, having been indicated as such on road signs on a non-statutory basis for some years previously) and their routes were designated under a Statutory Instrument ('SI') in 1994. The latest SI designating the routes of Regional roads was published in 2012: the Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012.\n\nOther roads formerly classified as Trunk or Link roads eventually became Local roads.\n\nOlder signs showing the former Trunk and Link road designations are still to be seen in some locations. The L (for Link Road) prefix on these signs is not connected to the network of Local roads currently in place.\n\nUnlike national roads, regional roads are maintained by local county or city councils rather than the National Roads Authority. The vast majority of the regional road network is made up of single-carriageway roads although some roads are dual-carriageway (see: High-capacity regional roads below). Until the late 1990s, such roads were often in a very poor condition, although increased road maintenance funding to local councils has resulted in more frequent resurfacing of regional roads, as well as relaying and realignment on some routes.\n\nRegional roads are generally subject to a speed limit of 80 km/h (imperial equivalent 50 mph), rather than the 100 km/h (imperial equivalent 62.5 mph) for national roads. Prior to 20 January 2005, when Ireland adopted metric speed limits, national and regional roads had identical speed limits of 60 mph. Regional roads, however, pass through towns, villages and built-up areas frequently, so even lower local speed restrictions are often in place. However, certain regional roads, often sections of former national roads which have been bypassed by motorways or other road improvements, have speed limits of 100 km/h. The R132 (former N1) is an example of a Regional road with a 100 km/h speed limit.\n\n, directional signposting on some regional roads in Ireland remains poor, with even modern signage usually relying on fingerpost signposts located directly at junctions. However, work on improving signposting on regional roads has been continuing since 2003; routes which previously had the most deficient signposting were selected for upgrading first. In 2007, a total of \"€7 million to continue progress on the regional roads signposting programme, which commenced in 2003\" was granted to local authorities.\n\nThere are some higher-capacity (i.e. not just single-carriageway) sections of regional road, most notably the R113 (\"Belgard Road\") and R445 (\"Old Naas Road\"), R132 Swords Inner By-pass and R136 Dublin Outer Ring Road which have sections of dual carriageway.\n\nIn some cases, important high-capacity urban routes are built or designated as regional roads, such as the mostly dual-carriageway R710 Waterford \"Outer Ring Road\", or the R774 Greystones to the N11 link, which is dual-carriageway for its full length.\n\nIn many other cases, upgraded regional roads (for example, wide two-lane roads) were previously part of a national primary road, prior to the construction of a motorway or other bypass. In most cases, when a national primary road is changed by the creation of a bypass (motorway or other), the road previously forming part of the route is reclassified as a regional road rather than as a local road.\n\nThe current routes of all regional roads in Ireland – as defined by Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No 54/2012 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012 under the Roads Act 1993 – are listed below. The S.I. specifies the start and end points of each route and the names of those townlands, villages, towns, and other settlements through which the route passes, as well as individual road names where necessary to establish the exact routing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n"}

It forms what is somewhat akin to an inner ring road (albeit mostly two-lane only).\n\nThe \"Childers Road\" was built in several stages to connect various suburbs on that side of the city (it was not originally envisaged as a ring road route). The first section linked the then N20/N21 \"Ballinacurra Road\" (from the city centre to Raheen and onwards to Cork/Kerry) to the \"Greenfields Road\", Janesboro and onward to the \"Roxboro Road\"/\"Fedamore Road\" (R511). The N20/N21 now commences just prior to the Roxboro Roundabout.\n\nThe next stage of the road continues on to link with the \"Old Cork Road\" (R512). Here it passes under the Limerick–Limerick Junction railway line. The road continues round to the \"Tipperary Road\" (N24), meeting at the Tipperary roundabout.\n\nThe final stage of the road, the last to be built, connects from the Tipperary roundabout, north to the \"Dublin Road\" (N7). The roundabout junction here is located at what is known as the \"Parkway\" area. The Parkway roundabout serves the Childers Road, Parkway Shopping Centre, Dublin Road, and old Dublin Road/Rhebogue Road.\n\nThe final section of the Childers Road also has a junction (between the Tipperary and Parkway roundabouts) with the \"Bloodmill Road\" (or \"Old Singland Road\"). A new retail development, Childers Road Retail Park has been built at this junction, and some of the Childers Road upgraded to 3 or 4 lanes. A new junction serves the retail park.\n\nUntil the opening of the M7 Southern Ring Road (a dual-carriageway running further from the city linking the M7, N18, M20/N21 and N24 roads), the Childers road carried traffic attempting to skirt past Limerick between these routes, in addition to city traffic to and between the various suburbs along the route (e.g. between Castletroy and Raheen). The road thus earned the title \"Limerick's car park\", and would feature each morning and evening on traffic reports. Traffic levels are now more suited to the road, but due to the new retail park, and increased traffic generally, delays along the route are still frequent.\n\nAs of 2007, the R509 now only follows part of the \"Childers Road\", between the R445 (at the \"Parkway Shopping Centre\" on the \"Dublin Road\") and the M20 (at \"John Carew Park\").\n\nThe Bus Éireann 308 bus route (city centre to Castletroy/University of Limerick) has a stop on the Childers Road near the Bloodmill Road junction. A cycle route runs along part of the Childers Road, and is due to be extended as part of a planned scheme of cycleways for Limerick.\n\nA new relief road was opened in 2006 between Plassey roundabout and New Tipperary Road (R527) which should help to alleviate much of the traffic congestion caused by the opening of the Childers Road Retail Park and Parkway Retail Park only 100 metres up the R509.\n\n\n\n"}

It combines the examination of conspiracy theories and contemporary history. \"Lobster\" is edited and published in the United Kingdom and has appeared twice a year for years, at first in 16-page A5 format, then as an A4 magazine. Operating on a shoestring, its contributors include academics and others. Since 2009 it is distributed as a free downloadable PDF document.\n\nAccording to the \"Hull Daily Mail\", \"Lobster\" 'investigates government conspiracies, state espionage and the secret service.' In 1986 the magazine scooped mainstream media by uncovering the secret Clockwork Orange operation, implicated in trying to destabilise the British government. Colin Wallace, a former British Army Intelligence Corps officer in Northern Ireland, described how he had been instructed to smear leading UK politicians. Questions were asked in the House of Commons and an extended scandal ensued.\n\nThe current curator of the CIA Historical Intelligence Collection, Hayden B. Peake, notes that the editors of \"Lobster\" see it as \"member of the international brotherhood of parapolitics mags,\" the other members being \"Geheim\" (Cologne, Germany), \"Intelligence Newsletter\" (Paris, France), and \"Covert Action Information Bulletin\" (USA), and is \"distinctive in its depth of coverage, its detailed documentation, and the absence of the rhetoric\".\n\nIn 1989, \"Lobster\" published names of 1,500 citizens said to be working in intelligence. The magazine was denounced in the House of Commons. The editors replied that all published details could be found in local libraries. The magazine has also carried detailed analysis of \"fringe\" subjects such as UFOs and remote viewing.\nIn 1982, an American newsletter about the Kennedy assassination, \"Echoes of Conspiracy\", put Robin Ramsay and Stephen Dorril in touch with each other because of their common interest in the JFK assassination story. A few months later, they decided to launch a magazine, and in September 1983, they published 150 copies of \"The Lobster\" priced at 50p. Ramsay later described himself and his associate: \"Dorril is a Freudo-anarchist, with Situationist tendencies; and Ramsay is a premature anti-Militant member of the soft old left of the Labour Party\".\n\nThe inaugural issue stated its aims as \"a journal/newsletter about intelligence, parapolitics, state structures and so forth [..] there is no copyright on the material in The Lobster [..] we hope to break even at the present price of 50p, but we may not [..] should appear 6 times a year\". From Issue 5 onwards, the cover dropped the definite article and became just \"Lobster\".\n\nPublishing frequency \"Lobster\" dropped to four issues in 1984 and three issues in 1986 and 1987, before settling down as a bi-annual from 1988. The \"Lobster\" logo (see illustration), first appeared in issue 20 in November 1990 and was designed by Clive Gringras.\n\nThe first 8 issues of \"Lobster\" are A5 paper size (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985. The magazine was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set litho duplicating machine. Around issue 17, the magazine was type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from \"Lobster\" 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. \"Lobster\" Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.\n\n\"Lobster\" is published not-for-profit. The \"Independent on Sunday\" quoted Ramsay that the magazine \".. always broke even, as I would put the price up if it started losing money. The readers paid whatever I asked\", which the newspaper commented \"Sounds a fine business model\". Robert McCrum in \"The Guardian\" quotes Ramsay as boasting that \"Lobster\" is \"the only left-wing journal to pay for itself\".\n\nIn March 1993, \"The Independent\" newspaper noted that the founders of \"Lobster\" had fallen out, and that \"The break between the two men began in December when Ramsay told Dorril he was removing his name from the \"Lobster\" masthead and would run the twice-yearly magazine alone.\" The London Evening Standard reported that Ramsay had told his readers that Dorril also planned to produce a magazine called \"Lobster\". After producing \"Lobster\" Issue 25, they each produced their own version of \"Lobster\" Issue 26. Dorril recalls a different version of events. Dorril's website indicates that his \"Lobster\" Issue 31 (October 1996) was the last published. Alternative media expert and Professor of Media and Culture at Edinburgh Napier University, Chris Atton, notes that Dorril's \"Lobster\" concentrates on the activities of the British and US security services, while Robin Ramsay's \"Lobster\" casts its net wider to encompass histories of fascism, the JFK assassination, the Lockerbie bombing and the military's medical experiments on service personnel.\n\nThe name of the magazine, \"Lobster\", has attracted multiple interpretations. Dorril recalls that \"We wanted the magazine to sound not pompous, and as a teenager, he would invent names for punk rock groups. 'Lobster' was just one of his favourites.\" Ramsay recalls that \"The name \"Lobster\" was Steve Dorril's choice. I couldn't think of an alternative and I didn't think the name mattered. As far as I know it had no connotations for Dorril; indeed as I remembered it, the absence of connotations was part of its appeal.\"\n\n\"Lobster\" published the first account of the Colin Wallace affair, also known as Operation Clockwork Orange, about the plot by disaffected members of Britain's Security Service, MI5, to destabilise the Harold Wilson Labour Government, and to smear politicians such as former Tory prime minister Edward Heath. The editors of \"Lobster\" described the revelations as Britain's Watergate and the biggest story since World War Two. The relevations were subsequently confirmed by former MI5 officer Peter Wright in his book \"Spycatcher\".\n\nIn late 1986, questions were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in \"Lobster\". Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up the issue in the House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in \"Lobster\" and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.\n\nIn 1989, British journalist Richard Norton-Taylor reported in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, that \"Lobster\" was planning to publish \"a list of the names and brief biographical details of more than 1,500 past and present officials involved, according to the publishers, in covert activities\". A year later the article appeared in \"Lobster\" Issue 19, and another appeared 18 months later. Although \"The Guardian\" noted that the Government was considering making the publication of such names a criminal offence, then \"Lobster\" co-editor Stephen Dorril noted that \"All the names and details .. have been compiled by research in their local libraries or have already appeared in published books. 'No inside knowledge or breach of official secrets was needed'\" 10 years later, Ramsay was quoted in the \"Hull Daily Mail\", that \"At the time it was a way of sticking two fingers up at the Government\".\n\nSubsequently, \"Lobster\" was denounced in the British Parliament. Then Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Wycombe, Ray Whitney, criticised the publication of the names in the House of Commons on 21 December 1988 in a debate on a proposed Official Secrets Bill, when he commented that:\n\nIn his book, \"Politics and Paranoia\", Ramsay criticised Whitney's role as the head of the Foreign Office's Information Research Department which Ramsay described as the \"State's official, anti-left psy-war outfit\", and had omitted to tell the Commons before denouncing him.\n\nIn addition to co-founders Robin Ramsay and Stephen Dorril, contributors have included:\n\n\"Lobster\" has published a couple of themed or special issues, including:\nA number of regular sections have appeared in \"Lobster\" over the years:\nIn 1998, the \"Hull Daily Mail\" described the magazine as \"a tiny but influential fringe political journal\". In 2001, the magazine Red Pepper wrote that \"Lobster\" \".. succeeds on the quality of its writing... articles are well researched... human, passionate and honest...\", the \"Fortean Times\" (who also syndicated a regular Lobster column by Ramsay) wrote that it was \"... immensely engrossing reading, ...an essential purchase for anyone interested in the machinations of the secret state\", \"Green Anarchist\" magazine wrote that \"Lobster\" is \"... an invaluable resource, and deserves to be widely read and much studied\", and Direct Action magazine described it as \"a good read ... very revealing and worth it, just for the pub talk\".\n\nJournalist Robert McCrum in \"The Guardian\" describes \"Lobster\" as \".. a left-wing journal that offers succour to conspiracy theorists [..] a brave, bright beacon, a Quixotic piece of typically English amateurism that keeps the professionals on their toes\". \"The Independent\" newspaper has described it as a \"delightful and worthwhile publications, more footnote than story, that [..] delivers a comprehensive picture of a clandestine world which the Establishment would prefer remained secret\".\n\nTrade Magazine \"PRWeek\" describes \"Lobster\" as a \"Hull-based intelligence magazine and conspiracy theorists' bible\", and the \"Conspiracy Encyclopedia\" described it as \"the most influential publication in the parapolitical underground\". Irish historical writer, Tim Pat Coogan, in discussing a TV programme about Captain Fred Holroyd in relation to the Collin Wallace affair, noted that \"some of the best writing on the Holroyd case is contained in smaller journals published contemporaneously, notably \"Lobster\", \"Private Eye\", and, in particular [Duncan] Campbell's own series [..] in the \"Statesman\"\".\n\nProfessor of Media and Culture at Edinburgh Napier University, Chris Atton, notes that a reference at the end of an article in \"Lobster\" led to the founding of the activist librarians' group Information for Social Change. CIA curator, Hayden B. Peake notes that a British journalist described \"much of its content its impenetrable\", but that it was also intriguing.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released as the sixth and final single from the album in June 7, 2005.\n\nMusically, the song blends elements of rap and Arabic music.\n\nAllMusic wrote: \"Eminem is plain-spoken and literal, intent on refuting every critic from Benzino at The Source to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who gets an entire song (\"Ass Like That\") devoted to him.\" \"HipHopDX\" editor J-23 was divided: \"'Ass Like That' is gonna be a song you either love or hate. Whatever the case, it sure is surreal to hear him rap an entire song as that Triumph puppet from MTV.\"\n\nScott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork was positive: \"Em also shines when he spins well off his axis, as he does on (...) the R.

Or to put it another way, [this track is] undercooked juvenile shite.\" \"USA Today\" wrote that \"On the lighter side, [Em] name-drops the likes of Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen on 'Ass Like That'.\" RapReviews noted that \"In 'Ass Like That' Slim impersonates Triumph the Insult Comic Dog for three perverse verses of ogling over the Olsen twins and booty bashing Hilary Duff.\" Josh Love of \"Stylus Magazine\" was negative: \"'Ass Like That', Em’s 'response' to Triumph, fares better, and actually makes a pretty salient point about Hollywood's fetishization of barely legal starlets, but then you realize that it's AN ANSWER RECORD TO AN AWARDS SHOW BEEF WITH A HAND PUPPET and suddenly you're not even able to make eye contact with the album cover anymore\" and he added that it does flash some Eminem's once-patented lyrical venom.\n\n\"The Austin Chronicle\" called the song a \"demented Bollywood fever dream [that] manages to out-deprave R. Kelly.\" \"SPIN\" said that the song was \"so sophomoric that [it borders] on surreal, all syncopated dis-gibberish and loony celebrity-baiting.\" \"The New York Times\" said that the song was \"brilliantly inane: Dr. Dre lays some curlicued sitars atop a lazy bass line, while Eminem pays tribute to Hilary Duff and the Olsen Twins, delivering his rhymes in a thick accent that's supposed to be either Triumph the Insult Comic Dog or Arnold Schwarzenegger (apparently, they talk the same).\" \"Slant Magazine\" called \"Ass Like That\" \"a whole song devoted to Robert Smigel’s Triumph The Insult Comic Dog\". \"The A.V. Club\" called it \"a track so muddled that it's hard to tell whether it's a song-length putdown of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog or an elaborate backhanded homage. The song backfires spectacularly, because Eminem and Triumph essentially share the same shtick—deflating celebrity egos with barbed wisecracks—and because at this point, Triumph is a lot funnier and more pointed in his putdowns than his human counterpart.\"\n\nThe music video was released on May 20, 2005.\n\nThe video begins with the instrumental to \"Evil Deeds\" (the second song from \"Encore\") playing in the background as famous people exit a limo, walking down a red carpet with fans off to the side. Eminem is the last to come out and as the news reporters ask him a question, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog interrupts by asking \"Yes I have a question, as a dog, I must know, what does Dr. Dre's ass smell like?\" The crowd gasps and Triumph continues to insult Eminem by saying \"You're so cute and small, no wonder Elton John loves you, your head comes up to his waist.\" (alluding to John's homosexuality and friendship with Eminem). Eminem shakes off the remark and attempts to answer the question originally posed to him by the reporter when Triumph once again interjects: \"Do you kiss 50 Cent with that mouth?\" Eminem swiftly punches Triumph and wrestles several security guards to the ground.\n\nIn the scuffle, as Eminem appears to be trying to choke Triumph, Triumph shouts out \"I'm not your wife!\" (alluding to Eminem's troubled relationship with his daughter's mother, Kim). The puppet dog becomes attached to Eminem's hand as the scuffle continues; and, as it is broken up, Eminem stands up with Triumph to sing the chorus of the song.\n\nThe video then switches between the \"real world\" and the \"puppet world\". There are puppet versions of many of the celebrities Eminem makes fun of (listed above), as well as Nick Lachey. The puppets from Crank Yankers also make an appearance, including: Elmer Higgins, Terrence Catheter, Birchum, Special Ed, Bobby Fletcher, Niles Standish, Spoonie Luv, Hadassah Guberman. Puppet versions of Dr. Dre and 50 Cent are also featured. A censored version of the song was featured in the movie \"Drillbit Taylor\" and briefly in HBO's \"You're Welcome America\". He sang an altered version of the song in the New York Tour DVD.\n\n"}

In addition to orchestral works, in 1949 he premiered a one-act opera based on the American novella \"Billy Budd\" by Herman Melville.\n\nGhedini was born in Cuneo in 1892. He studied organ, piano and composition in Turin, then graduated in composition from the Bologna Conservatory under Marco Enrico Bossi in 1911. He worked as conductor for a certain time, then he gave up to devote himself to teaching.\n\nHe worked as a teacher of composition in Turin (1918–1937), Parma (1937–1941), and finally Milan, where he directed the local Conservatory (1951–1962). Among his pupils, the most eminent were Marcello and Claudio Abbado, Luciano Berio, Guido Cantelli, Niccolò Castiglioni, Carlo Pinelli, and Fiorenzo Carpi.\n\nGuido Cantelli conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a broadcast concert of Ghedini's \"Pezzo concertante for two violins, viola, and orchestra\".\n\nHe died in Nervi, near Genoa, in 1965.\n\nThe composer was a deep lover of ancient music; he transcribed many works by such composers as Girolamo Frescobaldi, Claudio Monteverdi, and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. Ghedini's works are often inspired by music from the Renaissance and Baroque eras, but combined with a very personal language which combines ancient and modern styles. Among his masterworks are a \"Concerto for orchestra\" (in memory of Guido Cantelli), two violin concertos \"Il Belprato\" and \"Concentus Basiliensis\", and a concerto for two cellos \"L'Olmeneta (The Elm Grove)\" and \"Musica Notturna\" (\"Night Music\").\n\nGhedini's most celebrated concert piece is \"Concerto dell'Albatro\" (\"Albatross Concerto\") for violin, cello, piano, narrator and orchestra, which includes fragments from Herman Melville's novel \"Moby-Dick\" in its final movement.\n\nHe wrote a large number of chamber, vocal and choral works.

Originally Porto Amboim was known as Kissonde, a small village later colonized in 1587 by the Portuguese naming it Benguela and later Benguela Velha (Old Benguela) due to the creation of another village today known as Benguela located 350 km south of Benguela Velho. In 1923, the name was changed to Porto Amboim.\nToday (2014) Porto Amboim is one of the growing areas for the offshore industry.

{"id": "2271673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271673", "title": "Multi-master replication", "text": "Multi-master replication\n\nMulti-master replication is a method of database replication which allows data to be stored by a group of computers, and updated by any member of the group. All members are responsive to client data queries. The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group, and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members.\n\nMulti-master replication can be contrasted with master-slave replication, in which a single member of the group is designated as the \"master\" for a given piece of data and is the only node allowed to modify that data item. Other members wishing to modify the data item must first contact the master node. Allowing only a single master makes it easier to achieve consistency among the members of the group, but is less flexible than multi-master replication.\n\nMulti-master replication can also be contrasted with failover clustering where passive slave servers are replicating the master data in order to prepare for takeover in the event that the master stops functioning. The master is the only server active for client interaction.\n\nThe primary purposes of multi-master replication are increased availability and faster server response time.\n\n\n\nMany directory servers are based on LDAP and implement multi-master replication.\n\nOne of the more prevalent multi-master replication implementations in directory servers is Microsoft's Active Directory. Within Active Directory, objects that are updated on one Domain Controller are then replicated to other domain controllers through multi-master replication. It is not required for all domain controllers to replicate with each other as this would cause excessive network traffic in large Active Directory deployments. Instead, domain controllers have a complex update pattern that ensures that all servers are updated in a timely fashion without excessive replication traffic. Some Active Directory needs are however better served by Flexible single master operation.\n\nCA Directory supports multi-master replication.\n\nOpenDS (and its successor product OpenDJ) implemented multi-master since version 1.0.\nThe OpenDS/OpenDJ multi-master replication is asynchronous, it uses a log with a publish-subscribe mechanism that allows scaling to a large number of nodes. OpenDS/OpenDJ replication does conflict resolution at the entry and attribute level. OpenDS/OpenDJ replication can be used over a Wide Area Network.\n\nThe widely used open source LDAP server implements multi-master replication since its version 2.4 (October 2007) .\n\nApache CouchDB uses a simple, HTTP-based multi-master replication system built from its use of an append only data-store and use of Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC).\n\nEach document contains a revision ID, so every record stores the evolutionary timeline of all previous revision IDs leading up to itself—which provides the foundation of CouchDB's MVCC system. Additionally, it keeps a by-sequence index for the entire database. \"The replication process only copies the last revision of a document, so all previous revisions that were only on the source database are not copied to the destination database.\"\n\nThe CouchDB replicator acts as a simple HTTP client acting on both a source and target database. It compares current sequence IDs for the database, calculates revision differences, and makes the necessary changes to the target based on what it found in the history of the source database. Bi-directional replication is the result of merely doing another replication with the source and target values swapped.\n\nArangoDB is a native multi-model database system using multi-master replication. Clusters in ArangoDB use the CP master/master model with no single point of failure. When cluster encounters a network partition, ArangoDB prefers to maintain its internal consistency over availability. Clients experience the same view of the database regardless of which node they connect to. And, the cluster continues to serve requests even when one machine fails.\n\nCloudant, a distributed database system, uses largely the same HTTP API as Apache CouchDB, and exposes the same ability to replicate using Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC). Cloudant databases can replicate between each other, but internally, nodes within Cloudant clusters use multi-master replication to stay in sync with each other and provide high availability to API consumers.\n\neXtremeDB Cluster is the clustering sub-system for McObject's eXtremeDB embedded database product family. It maintains database consistency across multiple hardware nodes by replicating transactions in a synchronous manner (two-phase commit). An important characteristic of eXtremeDB Cluster is transaction replication, in contrast to log file-based, SQL statement-based, or other replication schemes that may or may not guarantee the success or failure of entire transactions. Accordingly, eXtremeDB Cluster is an ACID compliant system (not BASE or eventual consistency); a query executed on any cluster node will return the same result as if executed on any other cluster node.\n\nDatabase clusters implement multi-master replication using one of two methods. Asynchronous multi-master replication commits data changes to a deferred transaction queue which is periodically processed on all databases in the cluster. Synchronous multi-master replication uses Oracle's two phase commit functionality to ensure that all databases with the cluster have a consistent dataset.\n\nMicrosoft SQL provides multi-master replication through peer-to-peer replication. It provides a scale-out and high-availability solution by maintaining copies of data across multiple nodes. Built on the foundation of transactional replication, peer-to-peer replication propagates transactionally consistent changes in near real-time.\n\nAt a basic level, it is possible to achieve a multi-master replication scheme beginning since MySQL version 3.23 with circular replication. \nDeparting from that, MariaDB and MySQL ship with some replication support, each of them with different nuances.\n\nIn terms of direct support we have:\n\nMariaDB: natively supports multi-master replication since version 10.0, but conflict resolution is not supported, so each master must contain different databases. On MySQL this is named multi-source available since version 5.7.6.\n\nMySQL: MySQL Group Replication, a plugin for virtual synchronous multi master with conflict handling and distributed recovery was released with 5.7.17.\n\nCluster Projects:\n\nMySQL Cluster supports conflict detection and resolution between multiple masters since version 6.3 for true multi-master capability for the MySQL Server.\n\nThere is also an external project, Galera Cluster created by codership, that provides true multi-master capability, based on a fork of the InnoDB storage engine and custom replication plug-ins. Replication is synchronous, so no conflict is possible.\n\nPercona XtraDB Cluster also is a combination of galera replication library and MySQL supporting multi master.\n\nVarious options for synchronous multi-master replication exist. Postgres-XL which is available under the Mozilla Public License, and PostgresXC (now known as Postgres-X2) which is available under the same license as PostgreSQL itself are examples. Note that the PgCluster () project was abandoned in 2007.\n\nThe replication documentation for PostgreSQL categorises the different types of replication available. Various options exist for distributed multi-master, including Bucardo, rubyrep and BDR Bi-Directional Replication.\n\nBDR is aimed at eventual inclusion in PostgreSQL core and has been benchmarked as demonstrating significantly enhanced performance over earlier options. BDR includes replication of data writes (DML), as well as changes to data definition (DDL) and global sequences. BDR nodes may be upgraded online from version 0.9 onwards. 2ndQuadrant has developed BDR continuously since 2012, with the system used in production since 2014. The latest version BDR 3.6 provides column-level conflict detection, CRDTs, eager replication, multi-node query consistency and many other features.\n\nWithin Ingres Replicator, objects that are updated on one Ingres server can then be replicated to other servers whether local or remote through multi-master replication. If one server fails, client connections can be re-directed to another server. It is not required for all Ingres servers in an environment to replicate with each other as this could cause excessive network traffic in large implementations. Instead, Ingres Replicator allows the appropriate data to be replicated to the appropriate servers without excessive replication traffic. This means that some servers in the environment can serve as failover candidates while other servers can meet other requirements such as managing a subset of columns or tables for a departmental solution, a subset of rows for a geographical region or one-way replication for a reporting server. In the event of a source, target, or network failure, data integrity is enforced through this two-phase commit protocol by ensuring that either the whole transaction is replicated, or none of it is. In addition, Ingres Replicator can operate over RDBMS’s from multiple vendors to connect them.\n\n\n"}

He played for Major League Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers from to and was an All-Star in 1999, becoming the first Australian player to appear in an All-Star game. He ended his Major League career on 3 October 1999 with 837 games played, 789 hits, 105 home runs and a .284 career batting average.\n\nNilsson became a free agent in the offseason following , but opted not to sign with any MLB teams because of his desire to play for Australia in the 2000 Olympics. He was widely applauded for this move as he was turning down big money to represent his country, something very rarely seen in baseball. Before leaving the US, he had been Australia's second highest earning sportsman behind Greg Norman, according to the \"Business Review Weekly\".\n\nNilsson previously played for the Brisbane Bandits and Melbourne Reds in the previous carnation of the Australian Baseball League where he holds the record for all time batting average (.351) and all time slugging average (.661). His brothers Gary, Bob and Ron also played in the competition. He also played in the Japanese NPB and Italian Serie A. He went on to also represent Australia in the 2004 Olympics where they won a historic silver medal, and also represented his country in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006. He spent one season as manager with the Brisbane Bandits during the 2010–11 Australian Baseball League season, before returning to become the incumbent manager since 2014–15.

He made his professional debut that year with the Helena Brewers, batting .394. Nilsson ranked third in the Pioneer League in batting average but was left off the league All-Star Team at catcher in favor of Frank Colston, who hit .397. \"Baseball America\" rated Nilsson the #2 prospect in the league.\n\nIn 1988 he made his debut for the Queensland Rams in the Claxton Shield where he won MVP of the tournament. He then went on to play full season A ball for the Beloit Brewers and in the off-season played for the Gold Coast Clippers in the newly formed Australian Baseball League. In 1989 he moved to the affiliate, the Stockton Ports but struggled with the bat and failed to make an impact.\n\nIn the 1990 California League season, Nilsson had a significant improvement and helped the Stockton Ports win the title and \"Baseball America\" rated him the 8th best prospect in the league. Back in the ABL, Nilsson batted at .400 with the Daikyo Dolphins, only averaging behind fellow Brewers player John Jaha. Along with brother Bob, he helped Daikyo finish 31–9, best in the league. Nilsson was named to the league All-Star team at catcher and won the MVP Award.\n\nHe returned to the US at the age of 22 with the El Paso Diablos in AA batting with an average of .413 and was promoted to the AAA Denver Zephyrs before the end of the season. Nilsson was named as one of the two Texas League All-Star catchers that season alongside Iván Rodríguez. \"Baseball America\" named Nilsson the league's #4 prospect after Rodriguez, Royce Clayton and Raúl Mondesí. In the winter he helped Daikyo win the 1991–92 ABL season.\n\nAfter continuing to bat well for Denver in 1992, Nilsson was called up to the Brewers and batted in the 9 hole while playing catcher. Despite striking out in his first at bat, he redeemed himself later that game with a three-run double. Nilsson was one of the 10 youngest players in the 1992 American League in his first season.\n\nAfter performing below par in the 1992–93 ABL season, Nilsson was the most frequently used catcher for the 1993 Brewers, but due to injury problems, had rehab stints in the minors. On 11 April 1994, Nilsson hit the first home run at Rangers Ballpark in the fifth inning of the first game played there. He also grounded into the first double-play recorded at the ballpark, scored 1-6-3. On 14 April 1994, Nilsson and Graeme Lloyd formed the first all-Australian battery in an MLB game.\n\nIn the 1994 off-season, Nilsson moved to the Brisbane Bandits and played very well in the regular season averaging .362 and slugging .695. Nilsson homered off his first swing of the season that year. He was named to the league All-Star team at catcher. Milwaukee had originally requested that Nilsson be returned to the team in time for spring training but they later decided to let him stay for the playoffs. He helped Brisbane to an upset win over the Sydney Blues for the championship; he formed a battery with his brother Gary for the final inning of the last round.\n\nLater that year Nilsson had his first full major league season, producing a .275 batting average and .451 slugging average and won Brewers Player of the Year. He then returned to Australia after signing a five-year deal with the Waverly Reds where he played 54 games in the 1994–95 ABL season, leading in batting average (.388), on base average (.471) and slugging average (.775). Nilsson was again named as the All-Star catcher and led Waverly to their second title and Nilsson's third.\nNilsson contracted Ross River Fever while playing winter ball and missed the first two months of the 1995 Major League Baseball season, but after hitting over .400 in three rehab stints, he returned to the Brewers later in the season but was used primarily as a corner outfielder rather than catcher.\n\nDespite being a part owner of the team, Nilsson came to regret his five-year deal with Waverly as he missed his hometown of Brisbane and tried to negotiate a way out of the contract. The dispute lasted six months with the Reds finally coming to the agreement he would play out the rest of the 1995–96 ABL season before returning to Brisbane. In limited appearances, Nilsson contributed a meager .250 with the bat.\n\nHe returned to the MLB late again that season due to a broken foot, but had a productive year by setting his MLB career highs in average (.331) and OBP (.407) while still slugging at .525. He hit 33 doubles and 17 home runs, scored 81 runs and drove in 84 in 123 games. He was 6th in the 1996 AL in batting average. On 17 May 1996, Nilsson became the first Milwaukee Brewer to hit two home runs in the same inning (the 6th, vs. Minnesota Twins, in a 12–1 victory).\n\nNilsson became a player-manager for the Brisbane Bandits for the 1996–97 ABL season. Although knee surgery cut his season short, he guided the team to the finals with a batting average of .420 which, had he played enough games, would have led the ABL that year. He returned to the US where he batted .278 for the season with 20 home runs playing first base, left field and DH. That off season he did not return to the ABL for the first time due to injuries. In the 1998 season he batted at a discouraging .269 mark for the Brewers.\n\nNilsson was only 29 years old when he played his last major league season, hitting a 309/.400/.554 clip with 21 home runs for the 1999 Milwaukee Brewers season. He was also fit enough to play catcher regularly for the club for the first time in five years. In the 1999 All-Star Game, he replaced Mike Lieberthal as the National League catcher, becoming the first (and until being joined by Grant Balfour in 2013, the only) Australian to play in a Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\n\nNilsson is currently manager of the Brisbane Bandits professional baseball team in the Australian Baseball League (2014–present) and lead the team to the play-offs in the 2015–2016 season.\n\nIn 1999, Nilsson played in the Intercontinental Cup where he hit a .379/.457/.517 clip to win tournament MVP and help Australia win its first gold medal at an international baseball event. Nilsson was third in average behind Akinori Iwamura and Claudio Liverziani and made the tournament All-Star team at catcher.\n\nLater in 1999 he bought the Australian Baseball League and renamed it the International Baseball League of Australia. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics had his best-ever international tournament averaging .565 and slugging .957 as a DH/1B. He led the Olympics in average that year, 151 points ahead of runner-up Doug Mientkiewicz as well as also leading in both slugging and OBP. Despite his excellent performance, Australia finished just 2–5, ahead of only South Africa.\n\nNilsson managed the Queensland Rams in the 2003 Claxton Shield, assisting them to a surprise title. He returned to playing baseball that year for Telemarket Rimini in Serie A1 in Italy, where, although only hitting .280, he ended up slugging at a league-high of .920 and had an OBP of .561.\n\nNilsson played in the Australian season for the first time in five years when he appeared in the 2004 Claxton Shield. He went 5 for 11 with 4 home runs and 12 RBI and even pitched well in one stint on the mound. He led the 2004 Shield in home runs and RBI and was named to the All-Star team at DH. Nilsson then again attempted a comeback in the major leagues. He signed with the Atlanta Braves and hit .236 in 16 games for the Richmond Braves, five years after he had last played in the Major Leagues.\n\nNilsson was back with the Australian national baseball team for the 2004 Athens Olympics, and as captain he led the team to the Silver Medal, Australia's first Olympic medal in baseball. He again had a decent tournament performance batting .296/.441/.444 in 8 games. He had a perfect fielding percentage at catcher and threw out 5-of-8 attempted base-stealers.\n\nNilsson's career ended when he went 0-for-5 with a strikeout for Australia in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. In 2008 Nilsson was named to the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He entered the Hall of Fame with swimmer Ian Thorpe, Winter Olympics gold medalist Alisa Camplin, rugby league champion Allan Langer, tennis player Mark Woodforde, Australian football and media identity Lou Richards, and swimming coach John Carew.\n\nNilsson was invited by Brisbane Bandits CEO Mark Ready to manage the team for the 2014 Australian Baseball League season. Nilsson made numerous team and coaching staff changes which saw the team improve in their previous season standings. Nilsson continued to work on improving the culture and teamwork within the Brisbane Bandits throughout the 2015–2016 season, which saw Nilsson take the team to the 2016 post season and swept the Adelaide Bite to take home the Claxton Shield for the first time in the revamped Australian Baseball League .\n\nIn 2017 Nilsson coached the Brisbane Bandits to a 3rd-place finish during the regular season. Brisbane went on the beat the Adelaide Bite in the preliminary final and advanced to take on the Minor Premiers the Melbourne Aces in the Championship Series. Nilsson guided the Brisbane Bandits to a series sweep and back to back Australian Baseball League Championships.\n\nNilsson was the recipient of the Coca-Cola Amatil 2017 Queensland Sport Coach of the Year at the annual Q Sport awards.\n\nIn 2018, following three consecutive ABL championships with the Brisbane Bandits, Nilsson was announced as manager of the Australian national baseball team.\n\nNilsson currently lives in Brisbane and was manager of the Brisbane Bandits of the Australian Baseball League for the 2010–11 season.\n\nNilsson is currently manager of the Brisbane Bandits (2014–present) and the Australian national baseball team (2018–present).\n\nDave Nilsson is the uncle of Brisbane Bandits standout Mitch Nilsson.\n\n"}

It was released on February 25, 2003, as the fourth single from \"The Eminem Show\" and the final single in the United States. The song samples \"Dream On\" by American hard rock band Aerosmith.\n\n\"Sing for the Moment\" received positive reviews from music critics, with many critics praising Eminem's rapping ability, the lyrics, and the \"Dream On\" sample. \"Sing for the Moment\" proved to be successful, peaking inside the Top 10 in twenty countries. In the United States, \"Sing for the Moment\" reached number fourteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was also a number-one hit in Portugal. The song, along with the original \"Dream On\", was used in a trailer for the 2016 animated film \"Sing\".\n\n\"Sing for the Moment\" contains samples of the song \"Dream On\" by the rock band Aerosmith. Joe Perry plays the guitar solo at the end of the song, and a sample of Steven Tyler singing is used as the chorus for this song. Eminem chants \"sing\" when Tyler starts to sing the chorus, and Eminem also chants \"sing with me\" and \"come on\". Eminem says the words in his live performances as well. The beginning of the song samples the intro of \"Dream On\" too. \"Sing for the Moment\" was later released on Eminem's greatest hits compilation album \"\" (2005).\n\n\"Sing for the Moment\" deals with the themes of rap music's effect on society and the misunderstanding Eminem claims critics and parents have towards his message. Eminem uses the song to refute critics who have accused him of promoting violence to young people, saying that committing a crime is ultimately up to the offender in a post-9/11 world. He also explains that his music has an advantage for young people, claiming that his music is a relief from boredom and depression. Eminem's altercation with a bouncer named John Guerrera is also referenced in this song.That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it -\nSqueeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden\" The song reached #14 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles Chart, #6 on the UK Singles Chart, and #5 on the Australian ARIAnet Singles Chart.\n\nDavid Browne wrote: \"In 'Sing for the Moment,' which includes a tirade against the media and politically motivated prosecutors, the intensity of his delivery overcomes the hoariest of ideas – incorporating a portion of an overly familiar classic-rock oldie, Aerosmith's 'Dream On.' The song becomes a clarion call of suburban kids everywhere, not just an easy route to a hit.\"\n\n\"DX magazine\" concluded that in this song Eminem is dealing with his life and called it \"guitar-fueled track.\" RapReviews was positive: \"'Sing For the Moment' may throw his fans a curveball though: a song which appears to sample Aerosmith's 'Dream On' yet simultaneously features the REAL Joe Perry playing guitar. Obviously not a stretch for the hard rock icons though, who are still remembered for recording 'Walk This Way' with Run-D.M.C. back in the 1980's, so it's an enjoyable diversion from non-stop hardcore hip-hop.\"\n\nThe music video, released in 2003, is a collage created with various clips, including shots from the Anger Management Tour. It also contains cameos by various fellow rappers, including Dr. Dre, the members of D12, 50 Cent, Ludacris and Ras Kass. Eminem stands in neutral positions and stares at the camera several times in the video. The video is very similar to the 50 Cent music video \"If I Can't\". On \"The Eminem Show\", \"Sing for the Moment\" segues into \"Superman\". On \"\", the segue also fades out as \"Superman\", since Superman is not included in the compilation. In a clean version of the video, the word \"handguns\" is omitted from the second verse (\"any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\").\n\n\n"}

The battle was a victory for the Franks, and led to the conquest of the Roman rump state of Soissons, a milestone for the Franks in their attempt to establish themselves as a major regional power.\n\nIn the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire between 476 and 480, Syagrius was the only remaining representative of Roman rule in the area between the Loire and the Somme. Syagrius was the son of Aegidius, the last Roman \"magister militum per Gallias\"; he preserved his father's rump state, the Domain of Soissons, between the Somme and the Loire, calling himself dux.\n\nThe central location of Soissons in northern Gaul and its largely intact infrastructure allowed a level of stability in the years of the Migration Period, but also made the area tempting for their Frankish neighbours to the north-east. The realm of Syagrius was of almost the same size as the Frankish area, though the Franks were divided into small kingdoms, and, on the right bank of the Rhine, little touched by Roman culture.\n\nNevertheless, Clovis I managed to assemble enough Franks to confront Syagrius's forces. Clovis issued a challenge to Syagrius naming the time and place of the battle. Gregory of Tours mentions that one Chararic had brought his forces to the battlefield but then stood aloof, hoping to ally with the winner.\n\nThe ensuing battle was a decisive victory for Clovis and his Franks. Syagrius fled to the Visigoths (under Alaric II), but Clovis threatened war and the Visigoths handed Syagrius over for execution.\n\nConsequently, the realm of the Franks almost doubled in size; its border was now on the Loire adjacent to the realm of the Visigoths, who were finally routed at the Battle of Vouillé in 507 and forced to retreat south of the Pyrenées.\n\nIn due course Clovis marched against Chararic, captured him and his sons, and forced them to accept ordination and tonsures as deacons. On report of their hope to regain power, he had them executed.\n\n"}

It's also revealed how Giles survived the Bringer attack: when the Bringer approached, Giles heard his shoes squeak (though he claims to the Potentials that it was instinct) and overpowered and killed him.\n\nAt work, Buffy tries to hunt for clues as to whether Principal Wood is good or evil in his office. When she is about to open a cabinet, Principal Wood finds her in his office and asks her out to dinner. After Buffy leaves, Wood opens the case, displaying a large collection of blade weapons, into which he places a bloody dagger. Back at the house, Buffy expresses mixed feelings about the date, and is unsure over whether she is interested in him. Willow suggests that it would be good for Buffy to \"move on.\" Xander enters and reveals that he too has a date that evening, with a young woman he met at a hardware store. Upstairs, Buffy is getting dressed for dinner when Spike appears in the hallway, and tells Buffy that he feels fine about her having a date with another man, although Buffy tells him he doesn't have to be noble.\n\nOn Buffy's date, she and Wood are jumped by a group of vampires. Buffy slays most of them, and thinks that Wood has set her up until she sees him take out two of the vampires. At the restaurant, Wood reveals that he is a \"freelance\" demon hunter, and tells her about his mother — that she was a Vampire Slayer and was killed when he was four years old, after which he was raised by her Watcher. Buffy is struck by the idea that it is possible for a Slayer to have children. Meanwhile, Xander's date appears to be going well until he learns that she is a demon who has, like other demons, been motivated to work for the First.\n\nThroughout the episode, the First again appears to Andrew in the guise of Jonathan, and attempts to get him to kill the potential Slayers staying in the house, using the gun that Willow brought to the house in \"The Killer in Me\", while she was possessed by Warren. There is a mislead in which the viewers are led to believe that Andrew is successfully persuaded by The First Evil to kill the girls. However, it is revealed that Andrew is committed to helping Buffy and her friends, telling the First \"I'm good now.\" In the second scene with Andrew and the First, Andrew is wearing a wire that Willow has set up and the others are listening to his conversation with the First through Willow's headphones. Andrew shows the First the gun and asks it questions about its intents and potential weaknesses. The First discovers that Andrew is wired and is not pleased, but not before telling Andrew that it isn't time to use Spike yet for the First's purposes, hinting that he will be used in the future. The First appears to Willow, Dawn, Amanda and Kennedy in the guise of a horribly maimed Jonathan, threatening them before disappearing.\n\nImmediately after the First leaves, Willow receives a text message with a help code from Xander. Spike offers to go fetch Buffy. He finds her at the restaurant with Wood in a slightly romantic moment, and they all rush out to rescue Xander, driving in Wood's car, the three of them awkwardly together with Spike in the backseat. When they get to the seal beneath the school, they fight and kill the demon woman and find Xander not too badly hurt. They prevent the seal from opening again, but during the course of the fight, Wood finds out that Spike is a vampire and that Buffy cares about him very much, making him uneasy.\n\nBack at the house, Spike tells Buffy that as the First has revealed to have plans for him, that might endanger others, he will leave town. Buffy tells Spike not to leave because she isn't ready for him not to be there. In the final scene of the episode, the First shows itself to Wood in the guise of his dead mother (she is the Slayer seen previously during the 1977 flashback in \"Fool for Love\") and, though it does not say so explicitly, leads him to conclude that it was Spike who killed her.\n\n"}

{"id": "2271730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271730", "title": "Sweet Home (video game)", "text": "Sweet Home (video game)\n\nSweet Home is a survival horror role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom for the Family Computer in 1989. It is based on the Japanese horror film of the same name and tells the story of a team of five filmmakers exploring an old mansion in search of precious frescos hidden there. As they explore the mysterious mansion, they encounter hostile ghosts and other supernatural enemies. The player must navigate the intricately laid out mansion, battling with the enemies and keeping the player characters alive with the limited weapons and health restorative items available.\n\nThe game was directed by Tokuro Fujiwara, who previously worked primarily on arcade games such as \"Ghosts 'n Goblins\" (1985). Fujiwara toured the film's set to gather inspiration for the game, and the film's director gave Fujiwara permission to take some liberties with the game's script. \"Sweet Home\" was released in December 1989 exclusively in Japan, where it gathered generally favorable reception and was considered better than the film. The game was never localized to western markets, likely because of the game's gruesome imagery and the unpopularity of role-playing games outside Japan.\n\nIn retrospect, \"Sweet Home\" is considered a landmark game and is often cited for laying the groundwork for the survival horror genre. It served as the main inspiration behind \"Resident Evil\" (1996) which was a massive critical and commercial success, launching a multimedia franchise. Later games in the series continue to pull inspiration from the game through the use of quick time events, inventory management systems, and ghost story elements. \"Sweet Home\"'s Metroidvania-style exploration, storytelling methods, and horror elements have been cited as precursors to key elements found in other successful games decades later.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" is a role-playing game (RPG) set within a mansion that has a cohesive, intricate layout. There are five playable characters who can venture solo or explore in teams of two or three. The player can switch between characters and parties at any time. The five characters each have a unique item that is necessary to complete the game: a camera, lighter, medical kit, lockpick, and vacuum cleaner. Along with these items are others that can be picked up and dropped anywhere and retrieved later by other characters.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" places an emphasis on puzzle-solving, item inventory management, and survival. The player must backtrack to previous locations in order to solve puzzles using items acquired later in the game. In this sense, the interconnected mansion is gradually explored in the style of Metroidvania games. Enemies are encountered randomly and the player must fight or run away through menu-based combat. The battles are presented in a first-person perspective, and there are a variety of enemies, including zombies, ghosts and dolls. The only way to restore health is through tonics scattered across rooms in the mansion.\n\nThe story is told through cinematic cutscenes and through optional notes such as secret messages and diary entries of past visitors scattered across the mansion, which also provide clues for solving puzzles. The game also features quick time events when the player comes across a trap that requires a quick decision to be made, or else be killed. When a character dies, they remain dead permanently for the remainder of the game. Items that serve the same purpose as the dead character can be found near their corpse. For example, should the team nurse Akiko die, the team may find pill bottles which can be used to heal ailments. Depending on how many characters remain alive after the defeat of the final boss, there are a total of five different endings the player may receive.\n\nThe story is based on that of the 1989 film of the same name, but the writers took some liberties and expanded on the film's plot. Thirty years prior to the story in 1959, famous artist Ichirō Mamiya hid several precious frescos in his huge mansion before he mysteriously disappeared. In the present day, a team of five documentary filmmakers seek to recover the paintings from the abandoned, dilapidated mansion. Upon entering, they are trapped inside by the ghost of an unknown woman, who threatens to kill all trespassers. The team decides to split up and find a way out, but the mansion is both in danger of collapsing and is occupied by countless monsters.\n\nThe team find a projection room, where they find a projector that displays an image of a couple and their baby burning. They discover that the ghost is that of Lady Mamiya, Ichirō's wife. It is revealed that thirty years previously, Mamiya's two-year-old son had fallen in the house's incinerator and was burnt alive, and Mamiya attempted to provide playmates for her son by killing several other children. She committed suicide shortly after and her ghost, unable to forgive herself, became trapped in the mansion. The team arrives in the main chamber and confronts Mamiya in a final battle.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" was developed by Capcom and directed by Tokuro Fujiwara. He had previously directed \"Ghosts 'n Goblins\" (1985) and worked on titles such as \"Commando\" (1985), \"Bionic Commando\" (1987), \"Mega Man 2\" (1988), and \"Strider\" (1989). \"Sweet Home\" was one of his first console game projects after working primarily on arcade games. At times he was frustrated by the Family Computer (Famicom)'s graphics limitations.\nThe game is based on the 1989 film of the same name. Juzo Itami, the film's executive producer, and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, its director, served as the game's producer and supervisor respectively. Fujiwara took a tour of the film studio to gather ideas to build the game. Kurosawa told Fujiwara to not concern himself with following the movie exactly. Some of the items Fujiwara wanted to include in his game were ultimately left out because they did not match the atmosphere of the film. The game's plot ended up diverging somewhat from the film's. It was unprecedented at the time for a video game to expand on a film's narrative in this way.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" was released for the Famicom in Japan on 15 December 1989. It was promoted alongside the movie in the film trailer. The game received generally favorable reviews, and many critics believed the game was better than the film. \"Famitsu\" provided a score of 28/40. Critics believe the game's gruesome imagery dissuaded Nintendo's branches in the Western world from localizing the game. Also, the low popularity of RPGs at the time (at least in North America) may have had an influence on this decision. Although the game was never officially released outside Japan, fans translated \"Sweet Home\" to English in 2000 and released the modified ROM image on the internet. The translation took over a year to complete. To this day, some hobbyists load the ROM image onto actual Nintendo Entertainment System cartridges and sell the cartridges through online grey markets.\n\nIn retrospect, \"Sweet Home\" is considered one of the greatest horror games ever made and a landmark in the evolution of horror game design. It is often cited for laying the groundwork for the survival horror genre. Allistair Pinsof of \"Destructoid\" believed \"Sweet Home\" to be the single best Famicom game and dubbed it \"one of the very best games ever made\". He also called it one of the first games to realize the potential of a fully cohesive world as in the Metroidvania genre (even though \"Metroid\" (1986) attempted it first), and one of the first to use scattered notes and diary logs to tell a story, an element later popularized by \"BioShock\" (2007). Peter Tieryas of \"Kotaku\" wrote that \"Sweet Home\" successfully fused the RPG, adventure, and horror genres into a \"macabre\" in a way most other games rarely have. Marty Silva of \"1UP.com\" wrote that this mixture of genres was a precursor to \"Parasite Eve\" (1998). Ben Reeves of \"Game Informer\" called it a cult hit and Tokuro Fujiwara's most significant contribution to the video game industry. He continued by saying the entire horror genre \"owe[s] a blood debt to this long-forgotten 8-bit game that had no right to be as good as it was.\"\n\nThe horror elements of \"Sweet Home\" have received significant praise. Critics believe the game successfully created a haunting experience despite the limited technical capabilities of the Famicom hardware. The staff of \"Computer and Video Games\" called it \"one of the Famicom's finest technical hours.\" Tieryas wrote that technical limitations created opportunities for the designers to implement clever gameplay which contributed to the sense of horror. Pinsof agreed and praised the game's structure for creating a tense atmosphere. He wrote that the mansion feels unpredictable and the game is paced well, providing items at just the right moment to maintain the tension. He also praised the innovative and gruesome cinematic imagery. Silva believed the game had an impressive cinematic quality to it.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" served as the main inspiration for Capcom's \"Resident Evil\" (1996), a game which defined the survival horror genre and spawned a multimedia franchise. When development began in 1993, \"Resident Evil\" was originally intended to be a remake of \"Sweet Home.\" The game was directed by Shinji Mikami with Fujiwara acting as producer. Fujiwara believed the basic premise for \"Resident Evil\" was to do the things that he was unable to include in \"Sweet Home\", particularly in the sense of graphics. Since Capcom no longer had the rights to the \"Sweet Home\" license, they had to invent a new universe, but the game still adopted many elements from \"Sweet Home\".\n\nBoth games placed an emphasis on survival with elements such as the management of a limited inventory and health restoratives scattered throughout the game. \"Resident Evil\" was originally intended to have a first-person perspective influenced by \"Sweet Home\"s battles, before the perspective was changed during development. Some story elements borrow heavily from \"Sweet Home\". Both games are set in a mansion with an intricate layout, the story is told through the use of scattered notes, and there are multiple endings depending on how many characters survive. Other shared elements include the brutal imagery, door loading sequences, puzzles, backtracking, and characters with unique items such as the lockpick and lighter.\n\n\"Sweet Home\"'s influence carried further into the series than just the first game. It also inspired \"Resident Evil Zero\" (2002) which allows the player to switch between characters at will and drop items anywhere on the map for the other character to pick up. \"Sweet Home\"s quick time events are considered a precursor to those seen in \"Resident Evil 4\" (2005) and beyond. \"Resident Evil 7\" (2017) also shares similarities to \"Sweet Home\", including the plot of a film crew going to an abandoned house, a paranormal female presence in the house, and a tragic tale involving a family that once lived there. It also pays homage to \"Sweet Home\" in a side story told through a VHS tape. Peter Tieryas of \"Kotaku\" blamed the decline in critical acceptance of modern \"Resident Evil\" offerings on Capcom abandoning the basic gameplay design laid out in \"Sweet Home\".\n\n"}

Buffy and the other Slayers watch and learn from this example and Buffy lectures the girls on how to deal with vampire attacks. Buffy has Spike attack her to continue, but she easily gets the upper hand and pins Spike to the ground, reawakening some of his wounds and some feelings for both of them. In the Summers basement, the Potentials argue about petty things until Buffy gets their attention focused again with a strict reminder about the seriousness of death. They believe the First is taking a brief break from them, but it will come back stronger and better than before. While Dawn watches silently from the stairs, Buffy tries to give the girls another pep talk.\n\nAt work, Buffy talks with Xander on the phone until a student, Amanda, comes in for counseling. The girl asks about liking a boy who picks on her and seeks Buffy's advice, but Buffy gets a bit distracted with her own similar situation with Spike and rambles about how she's not going to let that problem happen again. Buffy returns home to bickering amongst the Potential Slayers and news from Willow that another Potential Slayer has been found, already in Sunnydale. The Potentials examine weapons and Dawn tries to fit into the group's conversation, but it's a struggle. Spike arrives and then leaves with Buffy and the other girls for some training. Andrew pouts because he's not invited and although silent, Dawn feels left out as well.\n\nWillow prepares the ingredients for a spell that will locate the Potential Slayer and surround her with a glowing aura. The spell is performed at the fireplace, but at first it doesn't succeed, just creates a horrible smell. Dawn tries to open a door to air out the room, but the light follows her, knocking her into the door and surrounding her. Dawn starts to freak out at the news that she's the latest Potential Slayer. She's worried that her becoming a slayer would mean her sister would have to die first. Dawn doesn't want to tell Buffy what's going on and goes upstairs to think alone while the rest of the gang debate the pros and cons of the situation and telling Buffy. Dawn overhears the conversation and feeling the weight of their concerns and her potential fate of death, she sneaks out the window.\n\nBuffy and Spike take the girls to a demon bar to explain the art of getting information out of the demonic patrons there. They run into Clem and after a brief happy exchange with him, Buffy secretly asks him to scare the overly confident Potentials. His face expands into a mass of snakelike limbs and such, making the girls scream and Spike laugh. While walking alone outside, Dawn runs into Amanda who has a scratch on her head and claims to have been attacked by a vampire. The girl explains that she got away and locked the vampire in one of the classrooms. Having heard rumors about Buffy, Amanda was going to ask for her help, but Dawn volunteers to take care of the problem.\n\nDawn and Amanda break back into the school, but when they reach the classroom, they find the door unlocked and don't see the vampire hiding wedged against the ceiling. The vampire falls as the girls try to leave and it chases them out into the halls until they reach locked doors. Trapped, Dawn turns to a fire extinguisher and when she can't get it to work, she knocks the vampire around with it instead then bolts with Amanda. Buffy and Spike show the girls a crypt and teach them about the living quarters of vampires. While investigating the area, the girls find a dead body, but Buffy shows them that it's a vampire.\n\nAt the school, Dawn and Amanda hide in a classroom and push a set of drawers against the door while Dawn prepares for a plan of escape. Buffy tosses the vampire around while lecturing the girls about successful fighting and keeping a straight head during battle. Meanwhile, Dawn puts Buffy's lessons to use and acts resourcefully until the vampire pins her to the ground and goes in for the bite. The Bringers then suddenly break in through the windows and grab Amanda instead of Dawn. After beating up the vampire a bit, Buffy drops her stake and along with Spike, she leaves the girls trapped alone with the vampire. Back at the house, Willow, Xander and Anya find that Dawn has bolted and Willow rushes to do a spell to find her before it's too late.\n\nDawn uses the room's chemistry supplies to set the Bringers on fire and escape with Amanda. She realizes that Amanda is the true Potential Slayer and willingly hands over the right and her weapon to Amanda. The frightened teen has a hard time grasping these strange realities Dawn explains, but she doesn't have much time to think about it. Xander arrives at the school with Buffy and Spike as the Bringers attack full force. Amanda keeps the Bringers at bay and stakes the vampire that attacked her earlier while Buffy and Spike finish off the Bringers. As Amanda rambles to Buffy about the strangeness she's dealing with, Dawn reveals that Amanda was standing outside the front door when she was hit by the aura cloud from Willow's spell.\n\nAmanda and the other Potential Slayers talk and bond about their successes with fighting the forces of darkness while Dawn secretly watches from the other room. Buffy checks in with Dawn, but she doesn't pick up on Dawn's real problem. While Buffy takes the other girls down to the basement for training, Xander catches on to Dawn's disappointment about not being a Potential. Xander confides in her how hard it is for him to be the powerless member of the gang and he relates to Dawn's pain. He reminds her that she doesn't need to be special with powers, she's \"extraordinary\" just the way she is. In return, Dawn suggests that he does have a power, his ability to notice what's really going on with the people he loves, despite the barriers.\n\nThe role of Amanda (who first appeared in \"Help\") was originally intended as a one-episode part, but was brought back as a recurring character (beginning with this episode) due to Sarah Hagan's connection to episode writer Rebecca Rand Kirshner, who wrote for Hagan's previous series \"Freaks and Geeks\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The plane clears, but the three don't see Willow. The scene repeats as Willow gets off the plane, but she doesn't see her friends waiting for her. A young man spray paints a wall of a construction site as a demon taunts him from the shadows and then attacks the frightened man.\n\nWillow lets herself into the Summers house, which appears to be vacant of her friends. Going up to what used to be her room, but now has been claimed by Buffy, Willow remembers the last time she was in the room. A door closes and Willow begins to investigate, but still her friends are nowhere to be seen. Alone, Willow curls up on the couch. Buffy, Xander, and Dawn return home and after talking about how Willow did leave England, but she had opportunities to divert to a location other than Sunnydale. They hear a noise upstairs and check it out, but find nothing. In the living room, the three talk about the reason for Willow's disappearance.\n\nThe next morning, Willow walks over to the magic shop and finds Anya cleaning up the magic shop. Anya is very cold to her and Willow feels guilty about everything. They talk a bit and Anya fills Willow in on everyone's activities since she's been gone. Willow checks out Xander's construction site and instead of Xander, she finds a skinned body. At the same time, Xander and Buffy are looking at the body and the familiar sight makes them wonder if Willow is back after all. Unbeknownst to them, a disgusted Willow climbs a ladder to exit the site.\n\nWillow walks the halls of Sunnydale High and proceeds down to the basement where she finds Spike acting insanely. He talks to Willow about the dead body, but also carries on a conversation with something else in the room Willow can't see. Buffy and Xander maneuver through the basement and find Spike seemingly talking to himself. Buffy and Xander try to get information from him, but Spike is simultaneously conversing with Willow, so his words make little sense. Spike suspects they can't see each other and that Willow's responsible for it. Buffy and Xander interpret some of Spike's comments to mean that he knows about Willow and they suspect she might have something to do with Spike's unstable condition.\n\nWillow goes to Anya at her apartment for help in finding the demon that skinned the man at the construction site. Anya helps Willow cast a spell to locate demons all over Sunnydale. After the spell is complete, Willow asks Anya to teleport to one particular location to a cave just outside the town. But Anya reveals that she can't for non-vengeance business as a result of her recently undoing a spell. Instead, Willow takes the long way and walks there herself. At the Summers house, Dawn immediately begins searching on the computer for demons that skin people. Although Buffy thinks it's a waste of time, Dawn soon finds a demon that meets their specifications named Gnarl. The demon paralyzes its victims with its nails, and then eats strips of skin from the body and drinks the blood.\n\nRealizing they need to search for a trail of blood, Buffy decides to recruit Spike to smell the way. He leads them to a cave where the demon can be found. Willow is already there investigating the cave and Gnarl spots her. The rest of the gang enters the cave as well, but they don't see Willow. The demon scratches Dawn's stomach and paralyzes her. Buffy and Xander take Dawn out of the cave and cover up the entrance, unintentionally trapping Willow with Gnarl. Stuck in the cave, Willow listens to the demon taunt her from the shadows. He slices her abdomen with a nail and, thus paralyzed, Willow is helpless against him as he sucks at the wound and starts to slice away slivers of her skin to eat.\n\nBuffy and Xander carry a completely paralyzed Dawn into the living room while Buffy researches Gnarl and the way to save Dawn. Anya is called to stay with Dawn while they prepare to return to the cave to kill the demon and save Dawn. Anya talks about seeing Willow and reveals that Willow may be at the cave, whilst she moves a paralysed Dawn into funny poses. Panicked that Willow is trapped in the cave, Buffy grabs Anya to join them at the cave. Once Anya reveals that she knows about Gnarl, Buffy insists she come along. Gnarl continues to eat Willow's skin as he tells her that her friends have abandoned her and she's all alone for him to eat. Buffy arrives and attacks Gnarl while Anya tends to a badly injured Willow who still can't see her friends. While Buffy fights Gnarl, Anya informs Willow that her friends didn't leave her alone.\n\nBuffy pokes the demon in the eyes with her thumbs, successfully killing it and ending the paralysis of both Willow and Dawn. Buffy and Xander look where they think Willow is while Anya runs for help, and slowly the spell making them invisible to each other wears off. Willow is relieved to see her friends and glad that they didn't abandon her.\n\nIn the morning, Willow meditates and uses magic from the earth to re-grow the skin she lost. Buffy stops by and talks with Willow. Willow reveals that her fear of seeing her friends and their judgment of her led to the invisibility problem from which they all were suffering. Buffy confesses that she briefly suspected Willow of the grotesque killing, but Willow doesn't blame her for that. Willow struggles to start meditating again, but she's still weak. Buffy offers her Slayer strength to her friend and joins in the meditation.\n\nCamden Toy, the actor who portrayed the flesh-eating demon Gnarl, had previously portrayed one of the 'Gentlemen' in the season four episode, \"Hush\". He would also have a recurring role of the \"Ubervamp\" Turok-Han later in the season, as well as playing the Nosferatu-like character \"The Prince of Lies\" in the \"Angel\" episode \"Why We Fight\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the preceding single which was as his humorous Slim Shady persona, \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was a serious song inspired by the events of Eminem's childhood and relationships. It depicts Eminem venting his anger towards his mother, Debbie Mathers, for the way she raised him. In the chorus, Eminem sarcastically apologizes to his mother for hurting her and making her cry, but takes it back by showing the world what his mother, according to him, was like.\n\nIt became the second Top 10 single from the album, reaching number four on the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and one of the highest-charting singles of his career. The song did not reach number one on any foreign charts, but was certified Platinum in Australia. \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was also used in the initial theatrical trailer to Eminem's film \"8 Mile\", released in November 2002.\n\n\nAllmusic highlighted this song. David Browne was lukewarm: \"The unhealed scars of his childhood are pored over in \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\": In the chorus, he apologizes for making his mama cry, but in the verses, he lashes out at her (\"you selfish bitch\") and vows to be a better dad than his own absentee father (\"I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\"). The song is both fragile and furious, and the syncopated music-box arrangement matches it in tension.\" J-23 was positive: \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" features the album's most personal rhymes as he lets us know just how he feels about his parents. His third verse, dealing with his mother, is truly something to behold.\" \"NME\" also praised the single: \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\", a stunning outpouring of grief-stricken anger against his mother.\" RapReviews agreed: \"The jokes don't last very long though, because Eminem's next song \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" is a direct attack on his mother for not really being one.\" \"Rolling Stone\" praised the song's production: \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" feature electric-guitar rhythms fraternizing with hip-hop-sensible drum patterns\" and he noted that his (Eminem's) relationship with his estranged mother creates \"Cleanin' Out My Closet,\" possibly the record's most powerful moment.\"\n\nTwo remixes of the song feature as European bonus tracks on the \"Straight from the Lab\" mixtape later released as a compilation: a Drum and bass remix (which was produced by DJ Green Lantern) and a remix combining the song with \"God is a Girl\" by Groove Coverage entitled \"(God Is) Cleanin' Out My Closet.\"\n\nIn the mashup video \"Atomic Closet\" (a fusion of Eminem's original \"Cleaning Out My Closet\" and Blondie's \"Atomic\"), Blondie's hit was heavily sampled as the background song, with Eminem rapping throughout. The video was directed by Dr. Dre and Philip Atwell.\n\nThe B side \"Stimulate\" appears on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the soundtrack \"Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture 8 Mile\", and also appears on \"Straight from the Lab\".\n\nThe song was mashed up with \"Hotel California\" by The Eagles, which appears on DJ Vlad and Roc Raida's mashup mixtape, \"Rock Phenomenon\".\n\nJon Connor's 2012 mixtape \"The People's Rapper LP\" included a remix of the song, as well as other Eminem remixes.\n\nIn October 2012, New York City hip hop artist Angel Haze released a reworked version of \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" using her own lyrics, in which she graphically recounts her experience with childhood sexual abuse.\n\nEminem’s 2013 album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, featured a song titled \"Headlights\" which serves as an apology to Eminem’s mother for things he said about her in songs, Cleanin’ Out my Closet is the only song mentioned by name.

He suggests that the older, grand-humanistic ideologies derived from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been exhausted, and that new, more parochial ideologies would soon arise. He argues that political ideology has become irrelevant among \"sensible\" people, and that the polity of the future would be driven by piecemeal technological adjustments of the extant system.\n\nThere is a 1930s literature derived from debates about the continued relevance of the Marxist scheme of class-generated ideologies, even in the less reductionist version set forth in most of Karl Mannheim's \"Ideology and Utopia,\" although his essay on \"Utopia\" does envision a loss of both utopian and ideological vision. Fascism rather than communism originally posed the question, insofar as the simplification of Fascism as \"ideology\" of the capitalist class lost credibility. One current of thought took up the theme of \"mass society\" and contended that the modes of control and resistance both had little to do with the ideology concept (Emil Lederer, \"The State of Mass Society\"). Although much of this was conjoined with conservative arguments about the \"revolt of the masses,\" there was also a current that looked to pragmatic problem solving where Fascism (and increasingly Communism) could be resisted or contained. Mannheim's \"planning\" writings ambiguously fostered this trend. Daniel Bell belonged to the next generation, when ideas about the institutionalisation of intelligence in ordinary democratic political processes became more sophisticated, as in the work of \"pluralist\" political theorists like David Truman, Robert Dahl and Daniel Bell. Technocratic notions at home on the Right played little part.\n\n\n"}

He was principal author of the standard work of neurology, \"Brain's Diseases of the Nervous System\", and longtime editor of the homonymous neurological medical journal titled \"Brain\". He is also eponymised with \"Brain's reflex\", a reflex exhibited by humans when assuming the quadrupedian position.\n\nBrain was educated at Mill Hill School and New College, Oxford, where he began to read history, but disliked it. The First World War having begun in 1914, the following year he joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit as an alternative to volunteering for combat, and was sent to York, moving later to the King George Hospital in London, attached to the X-ray department. On the introduction of conscription in 1916 his work enabled him to be exempted as a conscientious objector.\n\nAfter the war he returned to New College, and studied medicine, obtaining his BM BCh in 1922 and a DM in 1925; he specialised in neurology. Apart from his clinical practice, he was a member on a large number of government committees pertaining to physical and mental health, and was involved in the care of Winston Churchill on the latter's deathbed in 1965.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1931 and was President of the College from 1950 to 1956.\n\nHe was knighted in 1952, made a baronet on 29 June 1954, and on 26 January 1962 was created Baron Brain, of Eynsham in the County of Oxford. In March, 1964 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1964 he gave the presidential address (\"Science and Behaviour\") to the British Association meeting in Southampton. In this address he discussed how humanity was approaching the anthropocene and he reiterated Alfred North Whitehead's warning that \"A muddled state of mind is prevalent. The increased plasticity of the environment for mankind, resulting from the advances in scientific technology, is being construed in terms of habits of thought which find their justification in the theory of a fixed environment.\"\n\nHe married Stella Langdon-Down and had a daughter, Janet, and two sons, Christopher (b. 1926) and Michael (b. 1928). Christopher succeeded him as the 2nd Baron Brain and 2nd Baronet Brain.\n\nHe became a Quaker in 1931 and gave the Swarthmore Lecture in 1944, ‘Man, society and religion’, in which he stressed the importance of a social conscience.\n\n"}
{"id": "2271789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271789", "title": "Naumkeag", "text": "Naumkeag\n\nNaumkeag is the former country estate of noted New York City lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate located at 5 Prospect Hill Road, Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The estate's centerpiece is a 44-room, Shingle Style country house designed principally by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White, and constructed in 1886 and 1887.\n\nThe estate is noted for its large gardens, which were designed in the mid-20th century by noted landscape designer Fletcher Steele in conjunction with Choate's daughter Mabel. A National Historic Landmark District, Naumkeag is now owned by The Trustees of Reservations, who operate it as a nonprofit museum.\n\nNaumkeag was designed by architect Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White in 1885 as the summer estate for Joseph Hodges Choate (1832–1917), a prominent New York City attorney and American ambassador to England from 1899 to 1905, and then his daughter Mabel. The house is built in the Shingle Style with a wood-shingled exterior featuring brick and stone towers, prominent gables and large porch, and interiors with fine woodwork. It contains the Choate family's furniture, Chinese porcelain, and artwork collected from America, Europe, and the Far East.\n\nThe house sits within of terraced gardens (including The Rose Garden, The Afternoon Garden, and The Chinese Garden) and landscaped grounds surrounded by of woodland, meadow, and pasture. Its grounds were first designed in the late 1880s by Nathan Barrett, then replanned and expanded between 1926 and 1956 by the noted landscape designer Fletcher Steele. Barrett's original designs included two terraces, perennial beds (now the Chinese Garden), and an evergreen topiary. Steele's additions include the Afternoon Garden (1926); arguably his most famous design, the Blue Steps (1938); and the Chinese Garden (1936–1955).\n\nColonial settlement of the Prospect Hill section of Stockbridge began with the town's founding as a Native American mission community in the 1730s. The future site of Naumkeag was probably acquired by New York lawyer David Dudley Field in the 1870s, and purchased by Joseph Hodges Choate in 1884. Choate's family had vacationed in Stockbridge (where Choate's law partners also summered), and had picnicked on the property. Choate persuaded Field (whom he had opposed in the Boss Tweed legal cases) to part with on the south side of the hill.\n\nChoate was a longtime friend of architect Charles McKim, but most of the architectural design work was done by McKim's partner Stanford White. Although design work began shortly after the purchase, construction was delayed by the death of Choate's son. The house was completed in 1887 at a cost of about $35,000. White was also instrumental in providing the decorations and furnishings of the house, traveling to Europe with the Choates for the purpose.\n\nThe house underwent a variety of alterations and additions, some guided by architects George de Gersdorff and Charles Platt. The library was expanded in 1897, enclosing a space that had once served as a south-facing porch. The number of bathrooms was raised from four to seven in the early years of the 20th century. These changes, which included the addition of a porch to the master bedroom, necessitated the addition of a dormer on the third floor and a number of new windows. During the period of Mabel Choate's ownership only modest changes were made.\n\nJoseph Choate first offered the landscape design to Frederick Law Olmsted, but rejected his proposal to place the house halfway down the hill, where a favorite oak tree was located. The landscaping contract was instead given to Nathan Barrett, a self-taught designer then best known for his municipal work. Barrett's vision of the landscape was implemented between 1884 and 1894. His design included formal flower gardens near the house, and had a broad meadow slope down the hill, with an orchard and the family cemetery plot at the bottom. For the main fountain Choate commissioned White's friend and sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to produce a work; the result was \"Young Faun with Heron\".\nBetween 1895 and 1925 minor changes were made to the gardens under the guidance of Percival Gallagher and Marian Coffin. Design decisions in the later years were dominated by Choate's daughter Mabel, especially after Choate's death in 1917. Mabel acquired full control of the estate after her mother's death in 1929. Mabel Choate began her long and fruitful collaboration with designer Fletcher Steele in 1926. Upon her death in 1958 the estate was bequeathed to the Trustees of Reservations, to be \"an authentic representation of the times and manner of living which it now [1958] reflects.\"\n\nNaumkeag's main house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975; the listing was expanded and the entire estate was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2007. Its designation was made for the architecture and content of the house, which are well-preserved examples of a Gilded Age country estate, and for the innovative landscape design work of Fletcher Steele.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first locomotive to employ inside cylinders, and subsequently the 2-2-0 type became known as \"Planets\". On 23 November 1830 \"No.9 Planet\" ran the approximately from Liverpool to Manchester in one hour.\n\nIt only lasted in service about ten years; having been rebuilt in 1833, it was withdrawn circa 1840–1841.\n\nSix further of the type were ordered by the L&MR from Robert Stephenson & Co. Three more were supplied by Murray & Wood in Leeds, to whom Robert Stephenson & Co. had sent the drawings for their manufacture.\n\nThe \"Planet\" (from 1830) and the \"Patentee\" (from 1834, also designed by Stephenson) were the first locomotive types to be built in large numbers.\n\nThe \"Planet\" locomotives appear closer to subsequent types, and conversely look quite different from \"Rocket\" although only a year separated these two designs (Stephenson's \"Northumbrian\" representing an intermediate evolutionary step).\n\nOther improvements include:\n\n\nA working replica was built in 1992 by the Friends of the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Manchester, and is operated by volunteers to provide rides for visitors.

The name (and number) were passed to that locomotive's replacement in 1893, a Waterloo class 2-4-0. That locomotive lasted until 1909, but then remained unused for four years until a George the Fifth class 4-4-0 no. 2197 received the name. This locomotive was withdrawn in 1935.\n\nLMS Royal Scot Class 4-6-0 locomotive 6131 was originally named \"Planet\" when built in 1928, but in 1936 was renamed \"The Royal Warwickshire Regiment\".

He was fourth among eight children between Gregorio and Felipa: Rosario, Concepcion, Gregorio Jr., Emmanuel, Jose Ma., Lourdes, Antonio, and Carmen. He studied in Cagayan de Misamis (former name of Cagayan de Oro) Elementary School where he got the highest honors. He then went to the Ateneo de Manila High School and got his Associate in Arts at the Cebu UP Junior College.\n\nHe received his law degree from the University of Manila in 1938, and in the same year topped the Bar examinations. He worked as a Senate Clerk at the Journal Division from 1934 to 1935, Debate Reporter from 1935 to 1937, and court translator from 1937-1938. He was employed as assistant court reporter at the Court of Appeals from 1939 to 1940, then later Special Prosecutor of the People’s Court from 1945 up to 1946. Peláez practiced law and at the same time professor of law at the University of Manila from 1946 up to 1963. In 1949, he was voted Congressman, representing his home province. During his term as representative (1949–53) he was adjudged one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen by the Congressional Press Club, one of the Ten Most Useful Congressmen by the Philippine Free Press, and one of the two Most Outstanding Congressmen by the League of Women Voters of the Philippines.\n\nSuch achievements in the Lower House of Congress literally brought him to the Senate floor in 1953-60. He was unanimously chosen Most Outstanding Senator by two organizations, the League of Women Voters of the Philippines and the Senate Press Club.\n\nPelaez was elected Vice President in 1961, simultaneously performing the functions of Foreign Affairs Secretary. He resigned in 1963 as Secretary, after a dispute with the Macapagal administration. In the same year, he was chosen Man of the Year by the Examiner and the following year was adjudged the Most Outstanding Alumnus during the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the University of Manila.\n\nPelaez was again elected as representative to Congress in 1965. Two years later he held the office being a senator until the September 1972 proclamation of martial law. While he went back to private life and devoted his time to his family and law practice, he nevertheless continued to take an active interest in public affairs. In 1978, the 63-year-old lawyer of Misamis Oriental was elected Assemblyman in the Interim Batasang Pambansa and served as Minister of State.\n\nPelaez was Chairman and/or ranking member of Philippine delegations to various international conferences among which were: the UN 10th Commemorative Conference at San Francisco in 1955; the UN General Assembly meeting in 1957 and 1962; Interparliamentary Union Conference at London in 1957; in Peru and the Cameroon in 1972. He had been a member, consultant body of the Philippine Delegation to the SEATO in 1963. In 1973, President Marcos designated him as a member of the Philippine panel in the military bases negotiations with the United States. The RP-US Military Bases Negotiation was held in Washington, D.C. in 1975. This was his second time to serve the panel, the first time being in 1956 when he was the spokesman of the panel in the RP-US military bases negotiations then. Peláez served as Philippine ambassador to the United States of America during the Aquino administration. Pelaez served on the Committee of Honor of the Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER)- a United Nations accredited non-governmental organization and participated in the AER's ASEAN agro-industrial regional conference in May 1987 at the Manila Hotel.\n\nPelaez involved himself actively in various civic and professional societies. He served as Chairman of the Cadang-Cadang Research Foundation of the Philippines, Inc., the first Filipino scientific research foundation jointly financed by the government and the private sector for the eradication of cadang-cadang, an infectious viral disease which had threatened to wipe out the coconut industry.

{"id": "2271805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271805", "title": "The Way I Am (Eminem song)", "text": "The Way I Am (Eminem song)\n\n\"The Way I Am\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his third album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" (2000). \"The Way I Am\" was released as the second single from the album on September 7, 2000. It is also featured on his 2005 compilation album, \"\". In the tradition of most of Eminem's follow-up singles, \"The Way I Am\" is one of the songs for which he has sole songwriting credit. It features a much darker and emotionally driven sound than the album's lead single, which was \"The Real Slim Shady\".\n\nThe song is a prominent hardcore hip-hop track for its angst-ridden lyrics and hostile, aggressive delivery by Eminem. It features the first beat Eminem produced on his own, featuring an ominous bass line, a piano loop, and bell chimes. In the song, Eminem lashes out at people he feels are putting too much pressure on him, including overzealous fans and record executives expecting him to top the success of his hit single \"My Name Is\", though in fact he went on to do so with \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as well as other songs. He delivers each line extremely aggressively, almost shouting them out, representing the angry, resentful tone taken by the lyrics. The song contains the line \"When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school, and they blame it on Marilyn...\", referring to either Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold, the bullied perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre which took place the previous year, and the resulting media backlash against Marilyn Manson. The song has also been remixed by Danny Lohner featuring Marilyn Manson, who has performed the song with Eminem live on stage. The song reached number 8 in the United Kingdom, while in the United States it did not fare as well, not charting on the top 50. In 2005 it was re-released on the album \"\". \"The Way I Am\" was certified Gold in Sweden, selling over 20,000 copies.\n\nIn 2008, Eminem released a second autobiography titled \"The Way I Am\".\n\nThe song received very positive reviews. Aspects lauded were the vocal delivery, rhyme pattern, production and political material covered. Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters was positive: \"In \"The Way I Am,\" Eminem expounds, \"Since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse / And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works / And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve / All this tension, dispensin' these sentences.\" So there it is: he's performing therapy.\" AllMusic highlighted the song. Sputnikmusic described this song as \"Amityville's portrayal of the Detroit he grew up in; The Way I Am as a whole\". Same critic listed it in Recommended Downloads and praising the single: \"Built over doomy, gothic arpeggios, rumbling bass, and church bells, Eminem lays down one of the most perfectly formed lyrics of his career, weaving in and out of a tight rhyme scheme that echoes the loping piano motif. Interesting aside: this is one of the first Eminem songs that gives him 100% of the writing credits.\" IGN praised the song: \"Eminem is an angry ass white boy and the vitriol continues on \"I Way I Am,\" in which he soundly states \"I am whatever you say I am/If I wasn't why would I say I am?\" And when he complains that he's \"so sick and tired of being admired…\" one almost believes that he'll hang up the mic and disappear (but Em obviously loves the attention so that's not an option at this point in the game). The throbbing, tubular bell and piano laced beat only add to the intensity of the track (incidentally it was crafted by Em himself and it's one of the more stellar examples of his often hit or miss production techniques).\" Sal Cinquemani called this song: \"He (Eminem) revels in the fact that there's teen violence in upper-class cities on the epic \"The Way I Am.\" The song was named the 35th Best Song of the decade by the magazine \"Complex\". The same magazine, in April 2011, ranked the song at #3 on their 100 Best Eminem Songs list. The line, \"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am\" was inspired by the song As The \"Rhyme Goes On\" by Eric B and Rakim.\n\nThe music video at the beginning plays a slow instrumental of his song \"Kim\", after the \"Kim\" instrumental is played, the song carries on as normal and when the song starts, it shows him about to jump out the window of a tall building, and shows him falling through the sky, in a sequence inspired by the Coen brothers film \"The Hudsucker Proxy\", in which the hero also falls slowly from a skyscraper window. Marilyn Manson appears behind Eminem when the song refers to him — and a few more times thereafter. Other shots show fans coming up to him, asking for his autograph, The scene when EM throws a chair at his Slim Shady LP platinum plaque was inspired by the pressure EM felt by his label to write a hit as the first single for the Marshall Mathers LP. In “The Way I Am” video, Proof is in the scene when EM is doing a radio interview and flips the DJ off. Also, the little boy who asks for Eminem's photo in the public bathroom is his half-brother, Nathan. as well as Eminem in his neighborhood in front of an old house. At the end of the video, when Eminem hits the ground, it bounces him safely like a giant mattress. It Released By Paul Hunter. It was named the 19th Best Music Video of the 2000s by \"Complex\" magazine. In the music video version of the song wind sound effects can be heard when Eminem is singing the intro, the first & last chorus. This can't be heard in the album version.

The tattoo has different meanings in different cultures—it has been variously interpreted as a fertility symbol, a reminder of sayings on how to treat women or police, a recognition symbol among the Romani people, a group of close friends, standing alone in the world, or time spent in prison (with the outer four dots representing the prison walls and the inner dot representing the prisoner). Thomas Edison had this pattern tattooed on his forearm. The five dots tattoo is also most prevalent amongst gangsters. For example, in northern California it is a tattoo that symbolizes the membership of the \"15 Street Locos\", a juvenile institution gang, created and founded in Monterey County, CA and later spread across the county streets. In the US, it is also believed to have spread from Vietnamese gangs, who use it to mean, \"A group of friends\".\n\nThe five dot tattoo resembles the five shields on the Portuguese flag — the shields representing the five Holy Wounds inflicted upon Jesus during his crucifixion — and was formerly worn by many members of the Portuguese armed forces.

{"id": "2271813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271813", "title": "European Research Council", "text": "European Research Council\n\nThe European Research Council (ERC) is a public body for funding of scientific and technological research conducted within the European Union (EU). Established by the European Commission in 2007, the ERC is composed of an independent Scientific Council, its governing body consisting of distinguished researchers, and an Executive Agency, in charge of the implementation. It forms part of the framework programme of the union dedicated to research and innovation, Horizon 2020, preceded by the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7). The ERC budget is over €13 billion from 2014 – 2020 and comes from the Horizon 2020 programme, a part of the European Union's budget. Under Horizon 2020 it is estimated that around 7,000 ERC grantees will be funded and 42,000 team members supported, including 11,000 doctoral students and almost 16,000 post-doctoral researchers.\n\nResearchers from any field can compete for the grants that support pioneering projects. The ERC competitions are open to top researchers also from outside the union. The average success rate is about 12%. Five ERC grantees have won Nobel Prizes. Grant applications are assessed by qualified experts. Excellence is the sole criterion for selection; there are neither thematic priorities, nor geographical quotas for funding. The aim is to recognise the best ideas, and confer status and visibility to the best research in Europe, while also attracting talent from abroad.\n\nAlong with national funding bodies, the ERC aims to improve the climate for European frontier research. The Scientific Council has been keen to learn from the ERC’s peers in national research councils (European and overseas) and to engage in dialogue and appropriate collaboration. Also, some countries – such as Poland – have used the ERC model to establish national basic research funding bodies.\n\nThe idea of having a pan-European funding mechanism for basic research has been discussed and supported for a long time. However, its realisation was held back at the political level because the founding treaties of the European Union was interpreted as allowing union funding only to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry – that is, only funding for applied research rather than basic research. In conjunction with the Lisbon declaration in 2000, leaders of the EU, in particular the European Commissioner for Research at the time, Philippe Busquin, realised that the European Treaty had to be reinterpreted; a transformation of European economy from traditional manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy has to involve the enhanced support at the European level for science of all kinds, including both fundamental and applied research.\n\nIn 2003, a report from the ERC Expert Group (ERCEG), chaired by Professor Federico Mayor, described how the ERC could take shape. In 2004, a high-level expert group was commissioned to further explore the possibilities of creating a European Research Council. This group concluded that the EU should establish an institution to support frontier research. A number of other expert groups, such as one commissioned by the European Science Foundation, another charged with the task of analysing the economic implications of the Lisbon declaration and a high level group commissioned by the European Commission, also arrived at a similar conclusion and boosted the idea. With the ice broken, scientists and politicians have since strongly supported the establishment of an ERC. In 2006, the European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers accepted the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for the European Union's support for research, of which the ERC was a flagship component. In the ERC kick-off conference in Berlin, various speakers talked of 'an idea whose time has come', 'a European factory of ideas', 'a champions' league’, 'a great day for Europe and a great day for science', and the beginning of a 'snowball effect'.\n\nThe ERC is governed by the Scientific Council (ScC), consisting of 22 eminent European scientists and scholars (including Nobel prize laureates), and supported operationally by the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA), based in Brussels. The ScC acts on behalf of the scientific community in Europe to promote creativity and innovative research. It is responsible for setting the ERC's scientific strategy, including establishing the annual Work Programmes, designing the peer review systems, identifying the peer review experts, and communicating with the scientific community. The first Scientific Council members were nominated by Commissioner Potočnik in July 2005 and worked intensively to define the key principles and scientific operating practices of the ERC in preparation for the start-up.\n\nThe members of the Scientific Council are selected by an Identification Committee, consisting of highly respected personalities in European research, and appointed by the European Commission. The ScC members term of office lasts four years.\n\nFollowing its formal establishment, the Scientific Council reaffirmed the election of its Chair and ERC president, Professor Fotis Kafatos, and the two Vice-Chairs and ERC Vice-Presidents, Professor Helga Nowotny and Dr. Daniel Estève. After the highly successful Presidency of Fotis Kafatos, Helga Nowotny took over as President in March 2010 with Prof. Carl-Henrik Heldin and Prof. Pavel Exner as Vice-Presidents. In January 2014, after the end of Helga Nowotny's term of office, Professor Jean-Pierre Bourguignon became ERC President. Since then, the ERC also has a third Vice-President, Professor Nuria Sebastian Galles, alongside the two vice-presidents already in office (each of them in charge of one of the ERC scientific domains). In May 2019, internationally-recognized nanomedicine scientist Dr. Mauro Ferrari was named the next president of the European Research Council.\n\nThe ERC Scientific Council has established two Standing Committees: one deals with conflict of interest issues, the other oversees the selection of reviewers and panel lists.\n\nThe Scientific Council is supported operationally by the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA), based in Brussels. The implementing pillar of the ERC, the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), is responsible for supporting the peer review process, implementing the ERC strategy as set by the ScC, executing all financial operations and communicating about the ERC. The ERCEA is currently headed by the Director, Pablo Amor. It employs some 400 staff of which more than 50 hold PhDs.\n\nThe fact that most Scientific staff hold a PhD, have done post-docs and/or have been academics reinforces the feeling among panellists and the Scientific Community as a whole that ERC Schemes are implemented by scientists understanding the pitfalls and hurdles of Research and who are constantly working to better their procedures in order to simplify the application as well as the granting processes, hand in hand with their colleagues from financial units.\n\nThere is also a five-member ERCEA Steering Committee, chaired by the European Commission's Director-General for Research and Innovation, two ScC members, and two Commission officials.\n\nTo create an integrated institution consisting of the ScC and the ERCEA, two integrative mechanisms were initially put in place:\n\n\nUnder the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 the ERC has a budget of €13.1 billion for the period 2014 - 2020. That is a substantial increase from its initial seven-year budget under the EU's seventh Research Framework Programme (2007-2013), when the total allocated to the ERC was €7.5 billion. The ERC budget is supported by the European Commission and is supplemented by contributions from the EU associated countries. Together, the 27 EU member states and the associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nThe ERC's peer-review evaluation process must command the confidence of the research community and is central to the achievement of the ERC's objectives. The ERC Scientific Council divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted as follows. The peer review in the three domains is carried out by a total of 25 panels led by Panel Chairs whose scientific status gives credibility to the selection process. The peer review experts come from all over the world, which makes the ERC peer review process one of the most international of its kind on this scale. There are currently about 900 ERC panel members; together with the 2000 external reviewers, they constitute the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure.\nThe ScC encourages interdisciplinary proposals.\n\nThe two founding principles of the ERC regarding grants are:\n\nThe ERC asks researchers to think big, and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects, or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The grants are flexible, so that all costs for a specific project can be covered, and portable, meaning that if grant holders move to another university or institute, the grant moves with them.\n\nThe applicant can be of any nationality and age, and needs to demonstrate an excellent track record and present a ground-breaking research proposal. The research must be conducted in a Host Institution located within the European Union or an associated country.\n\nThe council offers the following grant schemes, with funding for up to five years:\nThe following charts present annual success rates.\n\nThe Scientific Council has adopted an ‘open access’ policy with regard to the access and availability of publications and research results. This requires all peer-reviewed publications from ERC-funded research projects to be deposited in the appropriate Internet-accessible libraries within six months of publication.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in June 2005 as the lead single from their debut studio album \"Grand Unification\" (2006). It charted at number 9 in the UK. To 'paint your target' is a military expression which refers to identifying and marking a target so that it can be attacked by other forces.\n\nThere are also two recorded versions of \"Paint Your Target\". One, recorded by Chris Sheldon, was released as a single and appeared on both of the music videos. The other, recorded by Colin Richardson, appears on \"Grand Unification\".\n\nThere are two videos for this song, one was banned because of scenes of children running around pretending to shoot each other, however this can still be found on the internet on sites such as YouTube and the second version with the band in a room playing the song. The room in the second version is similar to the one used in Feeders \"Find the Colour\" video. In the banned video, children are simply shown playing at soldiers with CGI muzzle flashes and missiles. Near the end of the song, a girl is nearly hit by a rocket and led away by a disapproving teacher. At the end, the pupils head back inside, although one stays outside briefly; his irises briefly take the shape of a mushroom cloud. The video can be interpreted as an ironic comment on how war and fighting are sanitised in mainstream culture.\n"}
{"id": "2271827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271827", "title": "My Name Is", "text": "My Name Is\n\n\"My Name Is\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his second studio album \"The Slim Shady LP\" (1999). It is also the opening song of that album. The song samples British singer Labi Siffre's 1975 track \"I Got The...\". The song was ranked at #26 on \"VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\". \"My Name Is\" was also ranked #6 on Q Magazine's \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". The song was placed at number 39 by \"Rolling Stone\" on their list of \"100 Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time\" in April 2016. The recording garnered Eminem his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000.\n\nProducer Dr. Dre used a sample of Labi Siffre's \"I Got The ...\" for the rhythm track. Siffre, who is openly gay, said in a 2012 interview that he refused to clear the sample until sexist and homophobic lyrics were removed from the song: \"Dissing the victims of bigotry – women as bitches, homosexuals as faggots – is lazy writing. Diss the bigots not their victims.\" The bass and guitar riff used in the sample was performed by Siffre's session musicians Chas Hodges and Dave Peacock, who later became the duo Chas & Dave.\n\nDuring the time the song was released, Eminem and Insane Clown Posse were having a \"rap feud\". After the release of this song, Insane Clown Posse parodied this song with a song called \"Slim Anus\". \"My Name Is\" was later re-released in 2005 on Eminem's compilation album \"\". The song is mixed with Jay Z's song \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and Beck's song \"Loser\" on the video game \"DJ Hero\", while Eminem himself remixed it with AC/DC's \"Back In Black\".\n\nThe video premiered on MTV \"Total Request Live\" on January 21, 1999. It was directed by Phillip Atwell, who would later direct music videos for several other Eminem songs, including \"Stan\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", and \"Just Lose It\". The video starts out with a stereotypical redneck family watching television, who then come across a show starring \"Marshall Mathers\" (Eminem's real name). As the video goes on, Eminem parodies several TV shows and movies. He also imitates then-President Bill Clinton, Johnny Carson, a porn star, and others. Basketball player Gheorghe Mureșan has a cameo appearance as a ventriloquist with Eminem being used as the dummy in the scene. Dr. Dre, the song's producer, also has a cameo as a doctor. It also shows Eminem imitating a chemistry teacher.\n\nThe video was ranked #71 in NME's \"100 Greatest Music Videos\".\n\nAs of 2019, the music video has been replaced on all official sites (including the official Eminem YouTube account and MTV's holding accounts) with alternative lyrics online making it more advertiser friendly. Lines such as, \"Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else\n'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt,\" are replaced with, \"Well since age twelve I've felt like a caged elf,\" also with lines referencing ripping Pamela Lee's tits off replaced with ripping her lips off and kissing them, saying how they feel soft like silicon.\n\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine singled out the song as an album highlight, while \"Rolling Stone\" noted that \"Eminem is on some serious Dangerfield shit in loser anthems like 'My Name Is'\" and Entertainment Weekly's David Browne wrote that this single and its accompanying video were both \"attention-grabbing\".\n\n\nEminem's mother Debbie Mathers filed a $10 million slander lawsuit against him for insinuating that she does drugs in the lyrics \"99% of my life I was lied to, I just found out my mom does more dope than I do\".\nEminem also berates his mother in the third verse of the song, with the lyrics \"When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits/How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom?! You ain't got no tits!\" Debbie stated in her 2008 book \"My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem\", \"This line was horrible and upsetting, because I'd contracted toxemia-blood poisoning when I gave birth to him and hadn't been able to breast-feed.\" The lawsuit was settled in 2001 for $25,000, of which Debbie received only $1,600, after Judge Mark Switalski ruled that $23,354.25 of the $25,000 settlement should go to Fred Gibson, Debbie's former attorney. Eminem would later reference this in his 2002 song \"Without Me\" with the lyrics, \"I just settled all my lawsuits--fuck you, Debbie!\"\n\n"}

The area of the commune is home to many ethnographic treasures which are preserved by local traditions or through the local cultural association which publishes a monthly magazine called \"Țara Hangului\". The main activities are agriculture, forestry, tourism, and car service. It is a typical mountain village, with the main institutions (school, police, local administration, health service, etc.) and a high rate of unemployment (about 20% according to the latest survey of AJOFM (The Job Service) Neamț). As a result, many inhabitants work abroad in Italy, Spain, Greece, or Germany. Except the national road 15C, all the other internal roads are not suitable for cars with low wheelbase. A running water system is provided by funds from Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD), however, further work still needs to be done on the village's infrastructure and environmental protection. \n\n"}

Meanwhile Buffy struggles with the possibility that Spike may have begun killing innocent people and \"siring\" them as vampires. The Scooby Gang tries to make sense of the strange apparitions of the dead they have been contacted by and wonder whether any or all of the information they gave them was true.\n\nMeanwhile, in London, a man and woman are attacked by cloaked men and Giles receives some troubling information.\n\nAt the Bronze, after staking a vampire who claims he made her, Spike calls Buffy's cell phone from a pay phone and tells her that he is remembering the bad things he has done recently and asks for her help. She agrees to meet with him at a set location. As Spike tries to leave, the duplicate of Spike shows up and tells the real Spike that calling Buffy was not part of the plan, but they'll have to improvise.\n\nSpike leads Buffy into a dark basement and tries to show her what he remembers about killing the girls. The fake Spike is there as well, but Buffy can't see him. While the real Spike tries to show Buffy where he buried the bodies, the fake Spike starts to sing the hypnotizing tune. This causes Spike to vamp out and attack Buffy, cutting her arm with a piece of broken glass. As the two battle the bodies of those Spike recently killed rise from the ground beneath them as newly turned vampires. Buffy struggles with the fledglings while the real Spike gets a pep talk from his morphing version about tasting Buffy's blood. As two vampires hold Buffy still, Spike leans down and tastes Buffy's blood from the cut on her arm. It reawakens all of his memories of killing and he falls to the ground, horrified.\n\nBuffy finishes off dusting the rest of the vampires and turns her attention to Spike. Tearfully Spike offers to be staked. He is confused, scared and hurting because of the lives he has taken. Buffy realizes something isn't right with Spike and something has been messing with his head. Buffy takes Spike back to her house and tells the gang how she needs to keep him close if she intends to get answers they need.\n\nGiles charges into the room in London and finds the dead girl and the nearly dead man that was with her. The man, Robson, warns Giles that something has started and that they need to be gathered.

He is forced to bind her physically and magically. He informs Buffy and Anya that he has been endowed with power from a powerful coven in England, which sent him to combat Willow. As Buffy and Giles talk, Willow subordinates Anya telepathically, so that Anya breaks Giles's binding spells. She throws down Buffy and resumes her magical duel with Giles.\n\nXander and Dawn continue to protect Jonathan and Andrew. Xander is becoming overwhelmed by guilt over his failure to act when Warren shot Buffy and murdered Tara. In Africa, Spike continues to complete stages of his ordeal.\n\nWillow and Giles continue to duel. As she begins to overpower him, Willow also directs a magical attack at Xander, Dawn, and the others, forcing Buffy to leave to protect them. Willow then defeats Giles and drains his magical strength; the power breaks down her emotional shields. Overwhelmed by her pain and all the pain she senses, she announces she will end it by ending the world.\n\nBuffy manages to partially block Willow's attack, but she and Dawn are thrown underground while Xander is knocked unconscious. Andrew and Jonathan flee, planning an escape to Mexico.\n\nAt the Magic Box, Anya comes to and finds a weakened Giles on the ground.

Buffy tries to climb out of the hole by pulling coffins out of the surrounding dirt walls to stack and try to escape on. After Xander comes to, Buffy sends him to find some rope to help them get out.\n\nBuffy and Dawn quarrel over Buffy's protective behavior. Anya appears, telling Buffy that Willow is raising a satanic temple of dark magic from underground, and intends to use its artifacts to end the world by draining its life energies. She declares that Willow cannot be stopped by any magical or supernatural powers, and that Giles is likely dying, then teleports away. Xander hears the conversation, and leaves to confront Willow. Willow speaks to Buffy telepathically, telling her she deserves the right to die as a warrior, and raises earth-creatures to battle Buffy and Dawn.\n\nWillow begins her final ritual of destruction. Xander confronts her and physically tries to stop her from completing the ritual. She repels him with magic force, but, wounded, he renews his efforts. He reminds Willow of their friendship and that he loves her no matter what. He tells her that if she destroys the world, she kills him as well and that he will stay with her until she does. Willow's emotional barriers collapse, her dark powers drain away, and her physical transformation is undone. She collapses in tears.\n\nGiles revives and tells Anya that the magic Willow stole from him overpowered her emotional shields and gave Xander the chance to reach her. Anya is shocked to find that Xander saved the world. Buffy and Dawn reconcile as they clamber out of the pit.\n\nIn Africa, a severely bruised and bloodied Spike successfully completes his ordeal and demands his promised reward, his greatest desire. Accordingly, his soul is returned to him.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for this episode, director James Contner says that while filming the scenes with Willow and Xander on the cliff, the wind churned up dust, which blew into Alyson Hannigan's eyes.

Buffy faces the infamous Count Dracula, who has come to Sunnydale to make her one of his brides. In the process, he turns Xander into a Renfield of sorts, and Giles becomes enthralled with the three sisters, much like Jonathan Harker in the novel. However, after a brief spell during which Buffy is mesmerized by the Count, she regains her usual composure and defeats him.\n\nUnable to sleep, Buffy goes out to patrol the cemetery and after staking a vampire, she returns to bed with Riley. The next day, Buffy and Riley play around at the beach, until Willow magically ignites the barbecue, and a sudden storm forces them all to seek shelter from the rain.\n\nElsewhere, two men deliver a large crate to a residence, but when they drop it, a clawed hand breaks through the wood and attacks one of the men.\n\nGiles has Willow start scanning books into a computer so that they can be resources for the gang to use. He then tells her that he's going back to England because it seems he's no longer needed by Buffy or the Scoobies.\n\nWhile patrolling, Buffy is confronted by a vampire who condenses from mist: he introduces himself as none other than Count Dracula himself. Buffy is starstruck, but when she tries to stake the legendary vampire, he disappears. Xander and Willow arrive to see Dracula before he turns into a bat and flies away. The women discuss how amazing Dracula is, and Riley and Xander both express their jealousy towards the infamous Dark Prince. Willow makes a lame attempt to attract attention to Giles and his usefulness, but the gang seems oblivious.\n\nAs Xander is walking home alone, he encounters Dracula. Using his mysterious charms, the vampire persuades Xander to be his aide and lure the Slayer to him. Riley asks Spike about Dracula, but the former commando is warned that Dracula is too dangerous for him to take on alone. Buffy awakens to find Dracula in her bedroom. (Joyce had earlier invited him into their home.) She is helpless against his powers and unable to stop him from biting her. When she wakes the next morning, she hides the puncture marks in her neck with a scarf.\n\nLater, the gang discusses their plan of attack. Buffy seems distracted and after hearing about the truths of Dracula, she leaves abruptly. Riley follows her and forces her to take off the scarf to show the puncture marks on her neck. Everyone is shocked to see that she has been under the control of Dracula. Since Xander is under Dracula's power, he has a strange hunger for spiders and attempts to defend the powerful vampire to his friends. Xander volunteers to have Buffy stay safely at his place, Willow and Tara use magic to protect the Summers's home, and Giles and Riley go after Dracula.\n\nAnya complains about not going after Dracula herself, until Xander locks her in the closet. Xander takes the willing Slayer to his \"Master\" in hopes of getting immortality in return. After being left alone with Dracula, Buffy tries to take control and stake him, but he is easily able to make her put the stake down. Riley and Giles discover Dracula's castle, remarking how they've never noticed it before, and enter carefully. Dracula talks to Buffy about all the things he will do for her while she struggles to regain control of herself.\n\nXander tries to stop Riley from going after Dracula, but Riley knocks him out with one punch. Giles finds himself victim to the Three Sisters who effectively keep him distracted. Dracula offers his blood to Buffy, and she hesitantly takes a drink. A flash of memories allows Buffy to break his control over her. Riley rescues Giles from the vampire sisters (though Giles is reluctant to leave them), and they go to save Buffy. Buffy and Dracula fight in a vicious battle, and finally Buffy stakes him. After they leave, Dracula comes back from the dust. Buffy is there and stakes him again, knowing he would come back. Dracula attempts to re-form again but is reminded by Buffy that she is \"standing right here\". He slips away in his mist-form.\n\nBuffy talks to Giles, telling him that she wants to be the Slayer again, to learn about her duties and her future. She asks Giles to be her Watcher again, and Giles is pleased. Buffy comes home and announces to her mom that she's going out with Riley. As she enters her room, she finds a girl there going through her stuff. Joyce tells Buffy that she should take her sister with her if she goes out, to which both girls immediately complain, \"Mom!\"\n\nThe vampire who was going to show Buffy a darker side of herself was originally envisioned as \"just another vampire who rode a horse and was all cool,\" says writer Marti Noxon. \"I kept saying, 'Like Dracula - until Joss Whedon said, \"Why not Dracula? He's public domain.\"\n\nNoxon says the scene in which Dracula implies that Buffy would \"make an amazing vampire\" thematically resonates with the questions of identity with which Buffy struggles throughout Season 5.\n\nWhen questioning Dracula's identity, Buffy mentions having encountered \"pimply and overweight\" vampires who named themselves after Anne Rice's vampire character Lestat de Lioncourt. This is the first indication that some vampires appreciate Rice's perspective on vampirism; in contrast, \"School Hard\" and \"Darla\" depicted some vampires as having contempt for Rice's concepts.\n\n\"Buffy vs. Dracula\" was first broadcast on September 26, 2000 on The WB Television Network. During its original broadcast, the episode was watched by 5.8 million viewers and received a Nielsen rating share of 3.9/6. This means that 3.9 percent of all households with a television viewed the episode, while among those households watching TV during this time period, six percent of them were actively watching the program. This was lower than the season three premiere, but higher than the season one and two premieres.\n\nIt was released on DVD as part of the fifth season on December 9, 2003.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2271872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271872", "title": "Broken plural", "text": "Broken plural\n\nIn linguistics, a broken plural (or internal plural) is an irregular plural form of a noun or adjective found in the Semitic languages and other Afroasiatic languages such as Berber. Broken plurals are formed by changing the pattern of consonants and vowels inside the singular form. They contrast with sound plurals (or external plurals), which are formed by adding a suffix, but are also formally distinct from phenomena like the Germanic umlaut, a form of vowel mutation used in plural forms in Germanic languages.\n\nThere have been a variety of theoretical approaches to understanding these processes and varied attempts to produce systems or rules that can systematize these plural forms. However, the question of the origin of the broken plurals for the languages that exhibit them is not settled, though there are certain probabilities in distributions of specific plural forms in relation to specific singular patterns. As the conversions outgo by far the extent of mutations caused by the Germanic umlaut that is evidenced to be caused by inflectional suffixes, the sheer multiplicity of shapes corresponds to multiplex attempts at historical explanation ranging from proposals of transphonologizations and multiple accentual changes to switches between the categories of collectives, abstracta and plurals or noun class switches.\n\nWhile the phenomenon is known from several Semitic languages, it is most productive in Arabic.\n\nIn Arabic, the regular way of making a plural for a masculine noun is adding the suffix (for the nominative) or (for the accusative and genitive) at the end. For feminine nouns, the regular way is to add the suffix . However, not all plurals follow these simple rules. One class of nouns in both spoken and written Arabic produce plurals by changing the pattern of vowels inside the word, sometimes also with the addition of a prefix or suffix. This system is not fully regular, and it is used mainly for masculine non-human nouns; human nouns are pluralized regularly or irregularly.\n\nBroken plurals are known as (, literally \"plural of breaking\") in Arabic grammar. These plurals constitute one of the most unusual aspects of the language, given the very strong and highly detailed grammar and derivation rules that govern the written language. Broken plurals can also be found in languages that have borrowed words from Arabic, for instance Persian, Pashto, Turkish, Kurdish, Azerbaijani, and Urdu. Sometimes in these languages the same noun has both a broken plural Arabic form and a local plural. E.g. in Pashto the word for \"purpose\" () can be pluralised in either its Arabic form for more formal, High Pashto. (Cf. the treatment of Latin words in English; e.g. the plural of \"index\" is either \"indices\" or \"indexes\", the latter being more informal.)\n\nIn Persian this kind of plural is known by its Arabic term (, literally \"broken plural\"). However the Persian Academy of Literature (Farhangestan) does not recommend the usage of such Arabic plural forms, but instead the native Persian plural suffix .\n\nFull knowledge of these plurals can come only with extended exposure to the Arabic language, though a few rules can be noted. One study computed the probability that the pattern of vowels in the singular would predict the pattern in the broken plural (or vice versa) and found values ranging from 20% to 100% for different patterns.\n\nA statistical analysis of a list of the 3000 most frequent Arabic words shows that 978 (59%) of the 1670 most frequent nominal forms take a sound plural, while the remaining 692 (41%) take a broken plural. Another estimate of all existing nominal forms gives over 90,000 forms with a sound plural and just 9540 with a broken one. This is due to the almost boundless number of participles and derived nominals in \"-ī\", most of which take a sound plural.\n\nSemitic languages typically utilize triconsonantal roots, forming a \"grid\" into which vowels may be inserted without affecting the basic root.\n\nHere are a few examples; note that the commonality is in the root consonants (capitalized), not the vowels.\n\n\nIn the non-semitic Persian language it is current to use:\n\n\nIn Hebrew, though all plurals must take either the sound masculine ( ) or feminine ( ) plural suffixes, the historical stem alternations of the so-called segolate or consonant-cluster nouns between CVCC in the singular and CVCaC in the plural have often been compared to broken plural forms in other Semitic languages. Thus the form \"my king\" in the singular is opposed to \"kings\" in the plural.\n\nIn addition, there are many other cases where historical sound changes have resulted in stem allomorphy between singular and plural forms in Hebrew (or between absolute state and construct state, or between forms with pronominal suffixes and unsuffixed forms etc.), though such alternations do not operate according to general templates accommodating root consonants, and so are not usually considered to be true broken plurals by linguists.\n\nBroken plurals were formerly used in some Ethiopic nouns. Examples include \"ˁanbässa\" \"lion\" with \"ˁanabəst\" \"lions\", \"kokäb\" \"star\" with \"kwakəbt\" \"stars\", \"ganen\" \"demon\" with \"aganənt\" \"demons\", and \"hagar\" \"region\" with \"ˀahgur\" \"regions\". Some of these broken plurals are still used in Amharic today, but they are generally seen as archaic.\n\n\n"}

Though primarily a magazine devoted to fashion and lifestyle, \"Details\" also featured reports on relevant social and political issues. In November 2015 Condé Nast announced that the magazine would cease publication with the issue of December 2015/January 2016.\n\n\"Details\" was launched as a downtown culture magazine in 1982. Alan Patricof bought the magazine in 1988. Condé Nast bought the magazine a year later for $2 million. Its current format stems from an October 2000, relaunch of the title, following a transfer of the magazine from Condé Nast to sibling division Fairchild Publications.\n\nBetween its last issue at Condé Nast and first at Fairchild, publication of \"Details\" was temporarily suspended. This allowed for extensive redesign and strategic repositioning of the magazine.\n\nFrequent contributors included Augusten Burroughs, Michael Chabon, and Bill Cunningham.\n\nIts editor was Dan Peres, the former husband of Australian actress Sarah Wynter. He was appointed to the post in 2000.\n\nPrevious contributors have included Beauregard Houston-Montgomery.\n\nIn 2004, \"Details\" published a piece titled \"Gay or Asian?\" that featured a photo of an East Asian man, and \"tips\" on how to tell the difference. Some of the text that accompanied the photo: \"One cruises for chicken; the other takes it General Tso-style. Whether you're into shrimp balls or shaved balls, entering the dragon requires imperial tastes.\"\n\nThe article generated protests over its racism and homophobia—and over how it erased the existence of gay Asian men. To protest, LGBT Asian American individuals and groups came together and held demonstrations.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1999 the magazine produced sampler CDs which were sent out to current subscribers free of charge. While the CDs concentrated on then current music, older songs were included as well. The initial CD was produced by Andrea Norlander of MTV, who oversaw concept, musical content, design, and marketing of the project.\n"}

He was the five-time Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives for Oregon's 4th congressional district.\n\nA former faculty member of the University of California, San Diego, Robinson now runs a privately funded laboratory known as the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in Cave Junction, Oregon, a newsletter called \"Access to Energy\", and publishes the \"Robinson Self-Teaching Home School Curriculum\".\n\nAs the Republican nominee for the Fourth District in Oregon, Robinson ran and lost to Democratic incumbent Peter DeFazio in five consecutive elections: 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. He served as Chairman of the Oregon Republican Party from August 2013 to February 2015.\n\nArthur Robinson was born in Chicago. He received a B.S. in chemistry from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1963, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, San Diego in 1968. His doctoral thesis was titled, \"Experiments on the synthesis and spectral characterization of cytochrome-related molecules\".\n\nRobinson was one of the few students ever to be appointed to the faculty of the University of California, San Diego immediately after getting his Ph.D., but resigned four years later.\n\nHe was a co-founder, along with Linus Pauling and Keene Dimick, of the Institute of Orthomolecular Medicine, later renamed the Linus Pauling Institute in 1973.\n\nRobinson was the president, director, and a research professor with tenure at the institute.\n\nIn June 1978, Robinson was asked to consult with the Executive Committee of the Linus Pauling Institute regarding important decisions involving the Institute. The members of the Executive Committee included Robinson, Pauling, and Executive Vice President Richard Hicks. The same day Robinson was asked to consult, he (Robinson) dismissed Hicks by terminating the fund raising services agreement employing Hicks, claiming that Hicks had failed to generate the substantial donations expected of him.\n\nDisturbed by Robinson's swift actions against Hicks, Pauling declared that he no longer had \"trust and confidence in Robinson\", and asked him to resign immediately. Robinson requested thirty days to consider the resignation and ultimately refused. Pauling called a meeting of the Board of Trustees regarding Robinson's refusal to resign. The board granted Robinson a leave of absence, and passed all executive authority to Pauling, later electing him president and director of the institute.\n\nRobinson responded to the dismissal by charging that he, not Pauling, had done the experimental work at the institute, and that \"Linus has not personally contributed significant research work on vitamin C and human health\". Robinson filed a lawsuit against the Institute for $25.5 million, finally settling for $575,000.\n\nRobinson later moved to Oregon and founded the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (OISM) there in 1980.\n\nRobinson is the president of the OISM, which is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Cave Junction, Oregon. The OISM's mission statement and purpose is, \"research, development, and public education on the biochemistry of molecular clocks and the degenerative diseases of aging, elementary science education, the effects of environment on health and welfare, and disaster preparedness\". The institute faculty has included Salk Institute biochemist Fred Westall, the late Nobel prize-winning biochemist Robert Bruce Merrifield, and the late Manhattan project physicist Martin Kamen.\n\nRobinson (in collaboration with the late Frederick Seitz) circulated what has been designated \"Oregon Petition\" urging the United States government to reject the global warming Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and similar policies, \nstating that \"the proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment,\" the advance of science, and human \"health and welfare\". The OISM website states that \"several members of the Institute's staff are also well known for their work on the Petition Project\", and that the petition has \"more than 31,000\" signatures by scientists. Robinson asserted in 2008 that the petition has over 31,000 signatories, with 9,000 of these holding a PhD degree. Most signatories with a PhD hold their degree in engineering. The 2009 report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)—a group that \"disputes the reality of man-made climate change\"—lists 31,478 degreed signatories, including 9,029 with PhDs. The list has been criticized for its lack of verification, with pranksters successfully submitting the names of Charles Darwin, a member of the Spice Girls and characters from \"Star Wars\", and getting them briefly included on the list.\nAccording to Bloomberg.com, starting in about 2013 Robinson began collecting \"thousands of vials of human urine\" which he claims hold \"the key to extending the human life span and wresting control of medicine from what he calls the 'medical-industrial-government complex'.\" As of early 2016, there were 14,000 urine samples stored in freezers at the OISM lab. According to Zachary Mider of Bloomberg, it is \"hard to judge the credibility\" of Robinson's claims. Although Robinson earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego in the 1960s, \"he hasn't published peer-reviewed research on diagnostic medicine in decades.\" In reply Robinson stated, \"we've completed experiments here, which we could easily publish, but we want to wait until they are perfect.\"\n\nIn his monthly newsletter \"Access to Energy\", Robinson has reported on experiments showing that ionizing radiation can be good for you, advocates for a revival of cheap nuclear power, attacks climate science as a \"false religion\" that will enslave mankind, and condemns public education, instead favoring home schooling. \nThe institute also publishes material relating to civil defense and disaster preparedness.\n\nIn May 2010, Robinson won the Republican primary for Oregon's 4th congressional district, taking 79% of the vote to businesswoman Jaynee Germond's 20%. He faced Democratic incumbent Peter DeFazio in the November 2010 general election. \nSix weeks before the election, $600,000 worth of TV advertisements started to appear in the district, portraying his opponent as \"a puppet of the Democratic leadership\". It was later revealed that the advertisements, reportedly a surprise to Robinson, were paid for by conservative billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. (Mercer provided \"six-figure financial support\" to Robinson again in 2012 and 2014.)\nRobinson was defeated by 145,091 votes (53.6%) to 120,307 (44.5%) but it was the \"best performance\" by a Republican in the district \"in decades\". Robinson vowed to try again in 2012.\n\nRobinson, running unopposed, became the Republican nominee for Oregon's 4th congressional district, to again face incumbent DeFazio, who had defeated Robinson's son Matthew in a landslide in the Democratic primary. In the general election, DeFazio defeated Robinson by 212,866 votes (59.1%) to 140,549 (39%).\n\nRobinson ran for a third time for Oregon's 4th congressional district in 2014. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced another rematch with DeFazio in the general election, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Robinson lost the election with 116,534 votes to DeFazio's 181,624.\n\nRobinson ran for a fourth time for Oregon's 4th congressional district in 2016. He ran against Jo Rae Perkins, a former Linn county Republican party chairwoman, in the primary election and won with 67 percent of the vote. In the general election on November 8. Robinson once again faced DeFazio, who won his primary election with 93 percent of the vote. DeFazio prevailed once more, 55%-40%.\n\nRobinson challenged DeFazio for a fifth time in Oregon's 4th congressional district. He faced four primary challengers this time, Perkins, again, plus former Eugene mayoral candidate Stefan Strek, Curry county commissioner Court Boice, and Michael Polen. Robinson won the nomination with 45.7% of the vote. \nDeFazio defeated Robinson 56%-41%. Robinson has already declared his candidacy to face DeFazio in 2020.\n\nIn addition to believing that global warming is a hoax, Robinson opposes abortion and supports gun rights, cutting taxes, increasing border security and building new power plants. He argues for balancing the federal budget, defunding earmarks and ending special-interest influence in Washington. He also supports ending the Federal Reserve System. Robinson is against bailouts to Wall Street banks. He also supports a strong national defense, but with a more restrained foreign policy. Robinson is a signatory to \"A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism\", a petition circulated by the Discovery Institute to promote intelligent design.\n\nIn 2011, Robinson alleged that Oregon State University (OSU) was part of a conspiracy to retaliate against him for his political activism by expelling his three children, all of whom were graduate students there. When asked what proof he has of the university discriminating against his children, Robinson stated, \"I don't have definitive proof, [...] That is what I believe. Basically, I know what happened. I cannot tell you the motives of the people doing it.\" In a statement, OSU would not comment on matters concerning the students without their consent, but declared all the other claims, including those about the faculty, to be unfounded.\n\nRobinson is a non-denominational Christian and lives in Cave Junction, Oregon. He was married to Laurelee Robinson until her death in 1988. His six children were all home schooled. As a hobby, Robinson buys unwanted pipe organs from churches and reassembles them on his property.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2271900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271900", "title": "Nationality law", "text": "Nationality law\n\nNationality law (or citizenship law) is the law in each country and in each jurisdiction within each country which defines the rights and obligations of citizenship within the jurisdiction and the manner in which citizenship is acquired as well as how citizenship may be lost. A person who is not a citizen of the country is generally regarded as a foreigner, also referred to as an alien. A person who has no recognised nationality or citizenship is regarded as stateless. \n\nNationality law can be broadly categorised into three principles, \"jus soli\", or right by birth on the soil, \"jus sanguinis\" or right of the blood, jus matriomii, or right of marriage. Laws may be based on any of these principles, but commonly is a combination of all three principles. Generally speaking, new world countries have a strong jus soli heritage (along with common law countries, until very recently, with the exception of the United States and Canada).\n\nJus soli is the principle, whereby birth on a country's territorial jurisdiction; eg, land, or in some cases, vessel registered as being registered as under the jurisdiction of that country (aeroplanes, ships), confers nationality of the country of birth to the child, in most countries this originated from the English common law tradition that all persons born on the King's land owed an allegiance to the King, and this law was inherited by the colonies and subsequently codified into their own domestic laws, see United States, Canada, Australia, etc.\n\nJus soli laws aren't always absolute. Sometimes countries with jus soli laws require lawful residence in the country before the authorities will observe this right, such as in Cambodia or Thailand. Sometimes jus soli laws only operate generationally, such as in some Middle Eastern countries, where a child born in the territory will only acquire citizenship if the child's father (regardless of nationality) was born in the same territory. Sometimes jus soli will be restricted by age.\n\nThere is also an intersection between the principles, where only persons of a certain race or blood, will acquire nationality at birth. For instance in Liberia, African born persons will acquire nationality, whereas those of non-African origin will not be entitled to this privilege.\n\nJus sanguinis is the principle whereby someone's blood dictates nationality of that person. For instance, in Italy; citizenship may be transmitted perpetually if one can find an Italian ancestor up until the founding of the Italian state in their lineage. Whereas other states may restrict their jus sanguinis transmission of nationality up to the registration of the second generation down the family line.\n\nSome states automatically confer nationality on the basis of marriage. Cape Verde is a prominent example where upon marriage, and request for the citizenship, nationality is automatically conferred. Countries have in the past regarded marriage as an important status changing event in people's' lives and encouraged the special relationship that exists between spouses, sentiments which continue to be valued today. The common practice within and among states at the beginning of the 20th century was that a woman should have the nationality of her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her previous nationality, often with the reciprocal recognition by the other country. Even after the nationality of a married woman was no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and men becoming subject to military service obligations. There has been a shift towards a principle that neither marriage nor dissolution of marriage automatically affecting the nationality of either spouse, nor of a change of nationality by one spouse during marriage automatically affecting the nationality of their spouse. However, in many jurisdictions spouses can still obtain special and fast processing of applications for naturalisation.\n\nBy international custom, each sovereign state generally has the right to freely determine who it will recognise as its nationals and citizens. Such determinations may be made by custom, statutory law, or case law (precedent), or some combination. In some cases, the determination may be governed by public international law—for example, by treaties and the European Convention on Nationality.\n\nNevertheless, state's rights to determine who their nationals are is not absolute and, in particular, States must comply with their human rights obligations concerning the granting and loss of nationality. In particular, citizens must not be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality. The right to a nationality and the prohibition against depriving ones nationality is codified in article 15 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nArticle 1 of the Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws states:\n\nThe Inter-American Court of Human Rights went further in limiting state's right to determine nationality:\n\nMost states today allow for aliens to acquire a nationality via a process known as naturalization on the basis of long-term residence and other conditions. This process and the conditions it entails are detailed in the states' nationality laws. Some nationality laws have special provisions to make it easier for diaspora populations to become citizens.\n\nSeveral countries' nationality laws have special provisions in them to simplify naturalization of favored ethnic groups. The laws in these countries appear to reflect a desire by governments to guarantee a safe haven to diaspora populations, particularly those assumed to be living under precarious conditions. A non-exhaustive list of such countries laws follows.\n\nArticle 14 of the Constitution of Armenia (1995) provides that \"[i]ndividuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure.\" This provision is consistent with the \"Declaration on Independence of Armenia\", issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that \"Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia\".\n\nCitizenship act of the Republic of Belarus (2002) states that permanent residence term requirements may be waived for ethnic Belarusians and descendants of ethnic Belarusians born abroad.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Bulgaria, Article 25(2): \"A person of Bulgarian origin shall acquire Bulgarian citizenship through a facilitated procedure.\"\n\nChapter Two of the \"Bulgarian Citizenship Act\" is entitled \"Acquisition of Bulgarian Citizenship\". The first section of that chapter is entitled \"Acquisition of Bulgarian Citizenship by Origin\", and provides at article 9 that \"[a]ny person ... whose descent from a Bulgarian citizen has been established by way of a court ruling shall be a Bulgarian citizen by origin.\" Separately, article 15 of the \"Act\" provides that \"[a]ny person who is not a Bulgarian citizen may acquire Bulgarian citizenship ... if he/she ... is of a Bulgarian origin\".\n\nThe immigration law of China gives priority to returning Overseas Chinese ethnic Chinese who were living abroad. As a result of the intersection between this provision and other factors such as the China's poor human-rights record that discourage foreign nationals in general from wanting to move there, practically all immigrants to China are ethnic Chinese, including many whose families lived outside of China for generations.\n\nThe Chinese government encourages the return of Overseas Chinese with various incentives not available to others, such as \"tax breaks, high salaries and exemptions from the one-child policy if they had two children while living abroad\".\n\nThe \"rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese\" are afforded special protection according to Articles 50 and 89(12) of the Chinese Constitution.\n\nIn April 2015, the Hong Kong Government announced a pilot scheme named \"Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents\" (ASSG).\n\nThe Croatian law on citizenship (), article 11, defines emigrants () and gives them privileges by excluding them from certain conditions imposed on others.\n\nThe Croatian diaspora makes use of this to obtain dual citizenship or to return to Croatia.\n\nThe Czech Republic grants citizenship, and thus the right of residence, to anyone whose parents are or were Czech citizens (unless the individual is also a citizen of a country that has a treaty with the Czech Republic barring dual citizenship of the Czech Republic and that country). Moreover, people of Czech origin might be granted the right to permanent residence (Czech origin is a reason worth of consideration).\n\nIn 1995, the Czech Republic amended its Citizenship Law to provide the Interior Ministry with the discretion to waive the usual five-year residency requirement for foreigners that had been resettled in the Czech Republic by 31 December 1994. This amendment was aimed particularly at several hundred ethnic Czechs which had been brought by the Czech government from the Ukrainian region of Volhynia, and was of a limited duration.\n\nThe amendment was consistent with what the Czech Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has identified as \"the Czech government's policy principles regarding the resettlement of foreigners of Czech origin living abroad.\"\nA private fund, the People In Need Czech TV Foundation, worked with government authorities between 1995 and 2001 to effect this resettlement in the specific instance of Russian and Kazakh citizens of Czech origin, and had resettled approximately 750 such persons as of 2000.\n\nArticle 36 (3) of the Constitution of Estonia states that \"Every Estonian is entitled to settle in Estonia.\"\n\nThe \"Finnish Aliens Act\" provides for persons who are of Finnish origin to receive permanent residence. It is usually Ingrian Finns from the former Soviet Union who exercise this right, but American, Canadian or Swedish nationals with Finnish ancestry are eligible.\n\nThe Finnish Directorate of Immigration states on its Returnees webpage that;\n\nGhana, in \"The Right of Abode\" law, allows for people of African descent to settle in the country.\n\nVarious phenomena throughout Greek history (the extensive colonization by classical Greek city states, the vast expansion of Greek culture in Hellenistic times, the large dominions at times held by the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire, and the energetic trading activity by Greeks under the Ottomans) all tended to create Greek communities far beyond the boundaries of modern Greece.\n\nRecognizing this situation, Greece grants citizenship to broad categories of people of ethnic Greek ancestry who are members of the Greek diaspora, including individuals and families whose ancestors have been resident in diaspora communities outside the modern state of Greece for centuries or millennia.\n\n\"Foreign persons of Greek origin\", who neither live in Greece nor hold Greek citizenship nor were necessarily born there, may become Greek citizens by enlisting in Greece's military forces, under article 4 of the \"Code of Greek Citizenship\", as amended by the \"Acquisition of Greek Nationality by Aliens of Greek Origin Law\" (Law 2130/1993). Anyone wishing to do so must present a number of documents, including \"[a]vailable written records ... proving the Greek origin of the interested person and his ancestors.\"\n\nIn 2010, Hungary passed a law granting citizenship and the right of return to descendants of Hungarians living mostly on the former territory of the Hungarian Kingdom and now residing in Hungary's neighbouring countries. Slovakia, which has 500,000 ethnic Magyar citizens (10% of its population) objected vociferously.\n\nA Person of Indian Origin (PIO) is a person living outside of India and without Indian citizenship, but of Indian origin up to four generations removed. It is available to persons of Indian origin anywhere in the world as long as they have never been citizens of Pakistan or of Bangladesh (a reservation excluding Muslims who joined Pakistan during or after the 1947 partition). This unusual type of citizenship by descent is an intermediate form of citizenship in that it does not grant the full portfolio of rights enjoyed by Indian citizens.\n\nThe Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 and Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 make provision for an even newer form of Indian nationality, the holders of which are to be known as Overseas Citizens of India (OCI). Overseas citizenship is not substantially different from PIO rights.\n\nHolding either PIO or OCI status does, however, facilitate access to full Indian citizenship. An OCI who has been registered for five years, for instance, need be resident for only one year in India before becoming a full citizen.\n\nIrish nationality law provides for Irish citizenship to be acquired on the basis of at least one Irish grandparent. Note that for the purposes of Irish nationality law a person born anywhere on the island of Ireland (including Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom where British nationality law applies: thus, people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to both British and Irish citizenship), is considered \"Irish.\" The entitlement to citizenship of all people born on Ireland and its islands was stipulated by the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State, and the 1937 Constitution of Ireland and reinforced by 1998 Belfast Agreement. A person born outside Ireland with entitlement to Irish citizenship through a grandparent born in Ireland may pass that right on to her or his own children. To do so, however, that person must register her or his birth in Ireland's Foreign Births Register prior to the children's births. Irish law also automatically grants citizenship at birth to any individual born abroad to a parent who was born in Ireland, without the need to register with the DFA prior to the granting of citizen's rights like holding an Irish passport.\n\nSeparately from this right, the Irish minister responsible for immigration may dispense with conditions of naturalisation to grant citizenship to an applicant who \"is of Irish descent or Irish associations\", under section 15 of the \"Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986\". With rare exceptions the applicant must be resident in the island of Ireland before applying for naturalisation.\n\nThe Law of Return is legislation enacted by Israel in 1950, that gives all Jews, persons of Jewish ancestry up to at least one Jewish grandparent, and spouses of Jews the right to immigrate to and settle in Israel and obtain citizenship, and obliges the Israeli government to facilitate their immigration. Originally, the law applied to Jews only, until a 1970 amendment stated that the rights \"are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew\". This resulted in several hundreds of thousands of persons qualifying for immigration to Israel (mainly from the former Soviet Union) but not being recognized as Jews by the Israeli religious authorities, which on the basis of halakha recognize only the child of a Jewish mother as being Jewish. People who would be otherwise eligible for this law can be excluded if they can reasonably be considered to constitute a danger to the welfare of the state, have a criminal past, or are wanted fugitives in their countries with the exception of persecution victims. Jews who convert to another religion also lose the right of return. Since 1950 2,734,245 Jews have immigrated to Israel.\n\nA special visa category exists exclusively for foreign descendants of Japanese emigrates (Nikkeijin) up to the third generation, which provides for long-term residence, unrestricted by occupation, but most Nikkeijin cannot automatically acquire Japanese citizenship, and must instead go through the process of naturalization. However, the Minister of Justice can waive the age and residence requirements if an applicant for naturalization has a special relationship to Japan, such as a Japanese parent.\n\nFrom the Constitution of Lithuania, Article 32(4): \"Every Lithuanian person may settle in Lithuania.\"\n\nThe Kola Norwegians were Norwegians who settled along the coastline of the Russian Kola Peninsula from approximately 1850 to the closure of the border in the 1920s. It is estimated that around 1000 Norwegians lived on the Kola peninsula in 1917. The Kola Norwegians were deported to or put in camps in other parts of Russia during the course of World War II.\n\nIt was only after 1990 that many of the Kola Norwegians again dared to emphasize their background. Only a few had been able to maintain a rusty knowledge of Norwegian. Some of them have migrated back to Norway. There are special provisions in the Norwegian rules of immigration and citizenship which eases this process for many Kola Norwegians. These provisions are in general stricter than in some other countries giving \"Right of return\". In order to obtain a permit to immigrate and work in Norway a Kola Norwegian will have to prove an adequate connection to Norway such as having at least two grandparents from Norway. Citizenship will then be awarded according to regular rules. As of 2004 approximately 200 Kola Norwegians had moved back to Norway.\n\nRepublic Act No. 9225, approved 29 August 2003, provided that all Philippine citizens who become citizens of another country shall be deemed not to have lost their Philippine citizenship. It further states that natural-born citizens of the Philippines who have lost their Philippine citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign country are hereby deemed to have re-acquired Philippine citizenship upon taking an oath of allegiance to the Republic, and that their children whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted, below eighteen (18) years of age, shall be deemed citizens of the Philippines.\n\nFrom the Constitution of Poland, Article 52(5): \"Anyone whose Polish origin has been confirmed in accordance with statute may settle permanently in Poland.\"\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the Portuguese parliament approved unanimously an amendment to its nationality laws which would permit the descendants of Jews expelled from Portugal in the 16th century to become Portuguese citizens.\n\nRomania extends citizenship to all former citizens, as well as to the children and grandchildren of those who have lost their Romanian citizenship, regardless of ethnic background.\n\nRussia offers citizenship to individuals descended from Russian ancestors who can demonstrate an affinity for Russian culture and, preferably, speak Russian. Concern about Russia's shrinking population prompted the program. This has had a positive effect because this has not only reversed Russia's population decline but has also increased the birth rate. Officials estimate that 25 million members of the Russian diaspora are eligible for citizenship. The Foreign Ministry has sent emissaries to countries around the world to urge the descendants of Russian emigrants to return home. So far 70% of Russians have come from Ukraine. Many of these people are in the age group of 17 to 25 looking for a better education and a better place to start a family. With a recent increase of Russia's life expectancy and living standard more people have been willing to come back to Russia. As of the 2014 war in Ukraine this has triggered a mass exodus of ethnic Russians in Ukraine into Russia. A small amount of these people have also come from Romania and a few Siberian people's reuniting with their families who have been split since the Cold War. Mostly immigrants have come from former communist countries. Some people returning are the descendants of Russians who fled Russia during the Russian revolution.\n\n\"Overseas Korean\" are eligible for dual citizenship. \n\nArticle 23 of the 2004 citizenship law provides that the descendants of emigrants from Serbia, or ethnic Serbs residing abroad, may take up citizenship upon written declaration.\n\nThere are three categories of Spanish citizenship:\n\n\n\"De origen\" is [almost exclusively] acquired at the moment of birth, mainly to a Spanish parent, and can never be lost. \"Por residencia\" is acquired through a predetermined period of legal residency in Spain. This distinction is important because Spanish nationality laws primarily follow \"iure sanguinis,\" including those relating to the right of return.\n\nThe third category, \"por opción\" (by choice), is given to some people of Spanish origins that, though not complying with the requisites to attain the original citizenship, are able to prove close ties to Spain; this option is given mainly to the children of people that have attained or recovered Spanish citizenship after their birth, but it has age limits and one must exercise this choice prior turning 20 (in some countries, like Argentina, prior turning 23, as majority of age is attained at 21 there). Most of the \"por opción\" clauses do not confer original status (except those included in the Historical Memory Law), thus it can be lost, and, in case one possesses nationality other than those described below as historically related to Spain (e.g., United States), renounce their current nationality in front of Spanish consular officials.\n\nIn practice this renunciation has little practical effect, and in some cases no effect, as only renunciations made to one's own country's officials has an effect on the linked nationality.\n\nThe Historical Memory Law (Spanish: \"Ley de Memoria Histórica\"), which took effect in December 2008, introduced temporary two-year changes to current Spanish nationality laws. Those whose father or mother were born original Spaniards (regardless of their place of birth, whether they are still living, or whether they currently hold Spanish nationality) and those whose grandparents emigrated due to political or economic reasons will have the right to \"de origen\" Spanish nationality. Until and while the Law of Historic Memory takes effect, the following laws will also apply:\n\n1. Natural-born Spanish emigrants (mainly exiles from the Spanish Civil War and economic migrants) and their children are eligible to \"recover\" their \"de origen\" Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. They also have the right to maintain any current nationality they possess.\n\n2. Regardless of their place of birth, the adult children and grandchildren of original Spaniards (original Spaniards are those who, at the moment of their birth, were born to people who possessed Spanish citizenship) can also access Spanish nationality on softer terms than other foreigners: they require just 1 year of legal residence, and they are exempted from work restrictions. This law in practice also benefits the great-grandchildren of emigrant Spaniards as long as their grandparents (born outside of Spain) are/were original Spaniards.\n\n3. Ibero-Americans and citizens of other countries historically related to Spain (Portugal, Andorra, Philippines, and Equatorial Guinea) also have a Right of Return: They can apply to Spanish nationality after 2 years of Legal residence (the usual time is 10 years for most foreigners) and they have the right to keep their birth nationality.\n\n4. Those of Sephardic Jewish origin also have the right to apply for nationality after a year of legal residency in Spain. Upon the rediscovery of Sephardi Jews during the campaigns of General Juan Prim in Northern Africa, the Spanish governments have taken friendly measures towards the descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 under the Alhambra Decree and persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition. The motivation for these measures was a desire to repair a perceived injustice, the need of a collaborative base of natives in Spanish Morocco, and an attempt to attract the sympathy of wealthy European Sephardis like the Pereiras of France. The Alhambra Decree was revoked.\n\nIn November 2012, the Spanish government announced that it would eliminate the residency period for Sephardic Jews, and permit them to maintain dual citizenship, on the condition that such citizenship applicants presented a certificate of their Sephardic status from the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain.\n\nSpanish diplomacy exercised protection over Sephardis of the Ottoman Empire and the independent Balkanic states succeeding it. The government of Miguel Primo de Rivera decreed in 1924 that every Sephardi could claim Spanish citizenship. This right was used by some refugees during the Second World War, including the Hungarian Jews saved by Ángel Sanz Briz and Giorgio Perlasca. This decree was again put to use to receive some Jews from Sarajevo during the Bosnian War.\n\nIn October 2006, the Andalusian Parliament asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would ease the way for morisco descendants to gain Spanish citizenship. The proposal was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the United Left. Such a measure might have benefited an indeterminate number of people, particularly in Morocco and other Maghreb countries. However, the call went unheeded by the central Spanish authorities (see Morisco#Descendants and Spanish citizenship).\n\nTurkey's immigration laws permit people of ethnic Turkish descent to obtain Turkish citizenship without the traditional five-year residence requirement required of others.\n\nThe immigration law of Taiwan (officially the Republic of China) gives priority to returning Taiwanese and overseas Chinese who are not citizens of the People's Republic of China, Chinese who were living abroad, and encourages their return. However, although Republic of China have not ceded the claim on mainland China, the government does not consider the people in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau as Republic of China nationals.\n\nOverseas ethnic Chinese can register as Republic of China national and apply for a Republic of China passport, however, they do not automatically have a right of return to Taiwan area if they don't have a household registration there.\n\nNot all Republic of China nationals have a right of return to Taiwan area even if they hold a Republic of China passport - specifically, those without a household registration in Taiwan area do not automatically have the right of return, may be refused entry, removed or deported from Taiwan area, and an entry permit is needed before 2011.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian law, anyone who was a citizen of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic who was residing in Ukraine at the time of its declaration of independence and any stateless person living on the territory of Ukraine at the moment of its declaration of independence was granted citizenship. Anyone born abroad to at least one parent with Ukrainian citizenship, including permanent residents of Ukraine, is entitled to Ukrainian citizenship. Children born within the territory of Ukraine to at least one Ukrainian parent, stateless persons with at least one Ukrainian grandparent, and children adopted by Ukrainian citizens are also eligible for citizenship.\n\nThe British Nationality Act 1948 conferred full and equal citizenship and settlement rights in Britain on all 800 million subjects of the worldwide British Empire. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, amending legislation passed in 1962, removed the right of entry from 200,000 south Asians long resident in British East Africa who had become the victims of the Africanization drive in newly independent Kenya and wished to move to Britain. The act required \"substantial connection\" to Britain, defined as (a) birth or the birth of a parent or grandparent in the United Kingdom, (b) a parent or grandparent who was Naturalised in the United Kingdom, (c) a parent or grandparent who became a citizen of the United Kingdom or its colonies by adoption (d) had acquired British Nationality under legislation passed in 1948 or 1964. Further provisions extended rights to stepchildren. The wording of this legislation refers to 'Citizenship', 'Naturalisation' and 'Residence', and at no point refers to any specific ethnicity or ethnic group.\nAnnouncing his support for right of return legislation in Britain, MP Quintin Hogg stated that, \"All the great nations of the earth have what the Jews call a Diaspora,\" and affirmed that nations \"special and residual obligation(s) toward them,\" which include recognizing their right to citizenship.\n\nThe Immigration Act 1971 affirmed the principles of the 1968 legislation, giving the right of immigration to the grandchildren of British citizens and nationals born in the Commonwealth nations. It was in effect long enough to enable the descendants of ethnic Britons to return to Britain from the former colonies.\n\nThe British Nationality Act 1981 differentiated between British Citizenship, British Overseas Citizenship, and British Dependent Territory Citizenship, recognizing the right of settlement only for British citizens. It is notable that it was enacted after the contraction of the Empire was completed, and was offered to all substantial populations of descendants of ethnic Britons in the former colonies.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the latest of a series of such Acts, establishes nationality law. This is codified in Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the United States Code. Section 101(a)(22) there states, \"the term ‘national of the United States’ means (A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2271915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271915", "title": "Fokker D.XXI", "text": "Fokker D.XXI\n\nThe Fokker D.XXI fighter was designed in 1935 by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker in response to requirements laid out by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (\"Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger\", ML-KNIL). \n\nThe D.XXI was designed as an inexpensive, rugged, and compact fighter aircraft that would possess respectable performance for its era. Entering operational use in the early years of the Second World War, it provided yeoman service for both the \"Luchtvaartafdeling\" (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force. Additionally, a few examples were constructed by the El Carmolí factory before it fell into rebel hands during the Spanish Civil War. Following the invasion and occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940, several captured Dutch D.XXIs were subsequently placed into service with the Luftwaffe.\n\nOn 14 November 1934, design proposals for a new fighter aircraft were submitted by Fokker to the Luchtvaartafdeling (Dutch Army Aviation Group). Fokker's design team, led by Erich Schatzki, and based at the firm's newly completed plant in the southern district of Amsterdam, had sought to incorporate and combine various new concepts and recent features from successful fighter aircraft, including the previous C.X and D.XVII aircraft. The proposed aircraft was a low-wing monoplane which adopted an entirely enclosed cockpit; initial design work had been conducted in cooperation with British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Limited, and it had been originally envisaged that the type would be powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel IV. Projections of the aircraft's performance included a maximum speed of 420 km/h at an altitude of 4,350 meters, a range of 888 km, and an altitude ceiling of 10,000 meters. The planned armament included rifle-calibre machine guns or 20mm cannons, which were to be embedded into the wings and fuselage.\nIn early 1935, the Luchtvaartafdeling signed a contract for a single prototype of the proposed fighter to be constructed for an evaluation to be performed by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. This prototype, designated \"FD-322\", which was powered by a single Bristol Mercury VI-S radial engine which drove a three-blade, two-pitch propeller, performed its maiden flight at Welschap Airfield, Eindhoven, on 27 March 1936. According to aviation author G.H. Kamphuis, the prospects for series production of the new fighter looked doubtful shortly after the first flight was performed due to a high level change in Dutch defence policy; Minister for Foreign Affairs H. Colijn informed the Defence Ministry that, in response to the changing international situation, a higher priority would be placed on building up a substantial bomber capability over new fighter aircraft. The change in policy emphasising bombers over fighters was somewhat controversial, in part due to order for new fighters and reconnaissance aircraft being both under consideration at this time, while a requirement for a new training aircraft had also been identified.\n\nIn addition to the Luchtvaartafdeling's interest in a trainer aircraft, the service had also attached great importance to the concept of a heavily armed 'cruiser' aircraft capable of performing multiple mission types. Further doubts and confusion were added by the emergence of a competing aircraft proposal in the form of the Koolhoven F.K.58, which had also been designed by Ir. Schatzki. The F.K.58 was somewhat more advanced than the D.XXI, possessing a retractable undercarriage and a higher top speed of 520 kmh. It was decided that the D.XXI and F.K.58 should participate in a series of comparative tests against one another, leading to the D.XXI prototype being dispatched to Soesterberg Air Base, Utrecht, in November 1936. However, head-to-head testing between the two types was delayed by the F.K.58, which did not perform its first flight until September 1938.\n\nDuring 1937, the Dutch government gave funding and its approval for a limited expansion of the Army Aviation Group, which resulted in an order being placed for 36 Fokker D.XXI fighters, to be powered by the 830 h.p. Bristol Mercury VII or VIII engines. According to Kamphuis, Dutch interest in the D.XXI had been revived, in part, due to an examination of the first aircraft by an evaluation board, which itself had been conducted due to interest expressed by the Finnish Air Force, which itself would result in export sales being made to Finland. On 20 July 1938, the first Luchtvaartafdeling D.XXI conducted its first flight, after which it participated in test flights prior to deliver to Soesterberg. On 8 September 1939, the final aircraft of the first batch of 36 was delivered.\n\nEven as the domestic demand for the D.XXI was being questioned, the type had attracted the attention of a number of foreign governments. In 1937, the Finnish government decided to place an order for an initial batch of seven aircraft, further negotiations were also conducted towards the acquisition of a manufacturing license, under which Finland proceeded to domestically produce further aircraft as well. Between 1939 and 1944, the State Aircraft Factory (Valtion Lentokonetehdas) at Tampere manufactured a total of 93 aircraft.\n\nThroughout 1940 and 1941, the Finnish State Aircraft Factory set about reconditioning the aircraft that had been used in the Winter War for continued service; an additional 50 D.XXIs were ordered in 1941, which were powered by the Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp Junior engine, acquired via Sweden. These can be identified by their longer cockpit glazing, smooth cowl, and large ventral air intake under the cowl. The two fuselage-mounted machine guns on these D.XXIs were relocated in the wings and the vertical tail surface was increased in size to offset the new engine. Owing to the increased loaded weight, the R1535-powered D.XXI had a slightly reduced performance and was not as maneuverable as the Mercury-powered versions. In 1944, five additional Finnish D.XXIs were assembled from spares.\n\nThe Danish government ordered a pair of D.XXI fighters along with arrangements for its own manufacturing license. The Danish D.XXI fighters were powered by a 645 h.p. Bristol Mercury VI-S radial and carried a Madsen 20 mm cannon under each wing. Ten aircraft were completed by the Royal Army Aircraft Factory in Copenhagen prior to the German invasion of Denmark in April 1940. The Second Spanish Republic also acquired a manufacturing license for the D.XXI. Reportedly, a total of 50 fuselages were manufactured on the Spanish production line; unfortunately, the Spanish plant in which the fighter was being produced was overrun by Nationalist forces prior to the completion of any of the Spanish-built aircraft. There are conflicting reports as to if any Spanish D.XXIs ever flew, some sources state that a single example managed to escape capture after the production facility's capture.\n\nThe Fokker D.XXI was a low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. Following standard Fokker design practice of the period, it featured a welded steel tube fuselage that was largely covered by fabric, including the flight control surfaces; element forward of the trailing edges of the wings were covered by detachable aluminum panels instead. The wings were of a wooden construction, being composed of two box spars attached to ribs made of plywood. The aircraft was outfitted with a fixed spatted undercarriage with cantilever legs; braking was provided by independently-operated pedals using compress air.\n\nThe cockpit of the D.XXI was fully enclosed by a plexiglas hood featuring large sliding sections, and was entirely jettisonable in an emergency situation to enable pilots to bail out. Pilots were protected against turnover injuries by means of a pylon built into the structure of the aircraft set behind the seat. Fuel was housed in a 77-gallon tank located aft of the engine, wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks could also be installed. The main armament consisted of two pairs of 7.92mm M36 FN-Browning machine guns, two being housed within the wings and the other pair within the forward fuselage, requiring the latter to shoot through the propeller blades; guns installed within the fuselage carried 500 rounds each while wing-mounted guns had 300 rounds each.\n\nUpon its entry to service in 1938, the D.XXI represented a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of aging biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker quickly proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft, being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive.\n\nDuring the early production of the D.XXI, Fokker's design office considered a number of developments to the basic design, including a wing re-design. A number of alternative engines were considered, including such power plants as the 650 h.p. Rolls-Royce Kestrel V and the 750 h.p. Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp Junior. During 1938, work on three extensively modified versions known as the 150, 151 and 152 were initiated. These aircraft were to be powered by the 1,375 h.p. Bristol Hercules, the 1,050 h.p. Rolls-Royce Merlin and the 1,090 h.p. Daimler-Benz DB 600H. Retractable landing gear was incorporated into these redesigns.\n\nThe Fokker D.XXI was first used in combat by the Finnish Air Force during the 1939–1940 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. Upon the war's outbreak, a total of 41 aircraft were in Finnish service, all of which being powered by the Mercury VIII engine. On 1 December 1939, the D.XXI achieved its first victory with the shooting down of a Soviet Tupolev SB. Against the aircraft of the Soviet Air Force, the Fokker was more evenly matched, and its rugged design with a radial engine and fixed undercarriage made it well suited for Finnish conditions. The performance of the Finnish D.XXI allegedly won the admiration of many Soviet pilots.\n\nAs the Winter War continued and newer models of Soviet fighters appeared, the Fokker D.XXI proved to be increasingly underpowered and too lightly armed (with only four 7.92 mm/.312 in machine guns) to compete; plans to arm the Fokkers with 20 mm cannons were dropped and only one fighter was armed as such (two 20 mm cannons and two 7.92 mm/.312 in machine guns). Another fighter was equipped with retractable landing gear, but due to less than anticipated performance improvement, was not continued in the series. The fixed undercarriage lent itself to both unimproved runways and conversion to skis for winter use, both of which were advantages in the Finnish theater. A total of 12 D.XXI aircraft were lost during the conflict, six being lost to accidents rather than enemy action.\n\nThe conflict between Finland and the Soviet Union was resumed in the Continuation War (1941–44), the D.XXI was again a key element of the Finnish Air Force. During the first air battle, six Mercury-engined D.XXIs shot down a pair of Soviet Ilyushin DB-3 bombers. Several Finnish Air Force pilots became fighter aces with the Fokker D.XXI. The top scoring Fokker ace, Jorma Sarvanto, obtained 12 5/6 victories with the type; many other future aces also scored at least one victory with the Fokker. The highest scoring airframe was FR-110, achieving 10 victories; this aircraft survived the war and is on display at the Central Finland Aviation Museum. Finland continued to operate their D.XXIs until 1949, and classified them as surplus to requirements in 1952.\n\nAlthough the order by the ML-KNIL was cancelled, the \"Luchtvaartafdeling\" (Dutch Army Air Force before World War II) placed an order of 36 aircraft, which were all delivered in time to participate in the war against the Germans in May 1940. On 10 May 1940, the day that Germany launched its invasion of the Netherlands, 28 D.XXIs were serviceable and ready for operations. That first day, six D.XXIs escorted a formation of Fokker T.V bombers to attack the Meuse bridges to hinder the German advance which were intercepted by nine German Messerschmitt Bf 109s; during the ensuing dogfight, one Bf 109 was shot down and two more damaged for the loss of one D.XXI and two T.Vs. That same day, a flight of D.XXIs intercepted and shot down 37 out of 55 inbound Junkers Ju 52 troop transports which had crossed the border during the early morning.\n\nDue to many aircraft becoming unserviceable due to battle damage after the first day, it was decided to regroup at Buiksloot, north of Amsterdam, on 11 May. For the following four days, missions out of Buiksloot were flown by D.XXIs flying in both solo and small formations to escort friendly units as well as in the search-and-destroy role. On 11 May, a minimum of two Bf 109 were recorded as having been downed by D.XXI fighters. Sorties against the numerically superior German forces continued until the middle of 14 May, at which point news of the Dutch capitulation reached Buiksloot, upon which both the remaining aircraft and the airstrip were destroyed to prevent their use by the Germans. Out of the original force of 28 D.XXI aircraft, eight fighters had remained airworthy. The D.XXI, although much slower and more lightly armed than the Bf 109, performed surprisingly well in combat due to its manoeuvrability. It was also one of the few aircraft that could follow a \"Stuka\" bomber into its dive. Nonetheless, the numerical inferiority of the \"Luchtvaartafdeling\" compared to the \"Luftwaffe\" resulted in the destruction of most Dutch D.XXI fighters during the campaign. Some were captured during and after 15 May, but their fates, apart from their capture, are unknown.\n\n\n1 \"Luchtvaartregiment\" (1 aviation regiment)\n1 and 2 \"Jachtvliegersafdeling (JaVa)\" \"(fighter squadron)\n2 \"Luchtvaartregiment\"\n\n\nRebuild Fokker Holland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK9yB1Sr7lo\n"}
{"id": "2271919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271919", "title": "Leopoldo Fregoli", "text": "Leopoldo Fregoli\n\nLeopoldo (Luigi) Fregoli (; 2 July 1867 in Rome – 26 November 1936 in Viareggio) was a stage star and Italian actor.\n\nFregoli was thought to be the greatest, most versatile quick-change artist of his day. He was famous for his extraordinary ability in impersonations and his quickness in exchanging roles – so much so that while he was performing in London in the 1890s unkind rumours spread that there was more than one Fregoli. He quickly quashed these rumours by inviting journalists and doubters backstage to see him at work: Fregoli had no secrets. He even went to see the host of imitators he inspired (\"The Great Trickoli\" and \"Fregolina\" were some examples) and offered them advice about how to improve their performances.\n\nOriginally an amateur entertainer, he took his first steps to professionalism while serving in the Italian army in Abyssinia under General Baldissera in 1890. A troupe of theatrical performers the general hired to entertain his soldiers did not materialise. Fregoli offered to fill in and was an immediate success. General Baldissera subsequently had Fregoli posted, not as a soldier but as a performer, to the theatre at Massowah, which he used to entertain soldiers. Fregoli became the director and stage manager of the theatre and casino. After a year he returned to Italy and performed in Rome, Genoa and Florence. In the audience at Florence was a government registry clerk, Ugo Biondi, who was so impressed with Fregoli's performance that he sought him out and asked for some lessons in how to follow in his footsteps. Fregoli generously complied and Biondi went on to be another great quick change artist – first claiming to be a pupil, but later set up as the 'original' Fregoli.\n\nFrom Italy Fregoli went to Brazil, Spain, and the United States. While he was in Madrid he was watched in performance by Alfred Moul, the general manager of the Alhambra Theatre in London's Charing Cross Road (which was being refitted at that time in the Moorish style under the direction of the great designer Owen Jones). Moul had heard of Fregoli's genius and wanted to be the first impresario in Britain to sign him up. He subsequently claimed that Fregoli (and his team of supporting assistants) were being paid £350 per week to perform at the Alhambra – a remarkable amount for the time. But this was nothing compared to what Fregoli was to generate in ticket sales.\n\nThe Alhambra was scheduled to reopen early in March 1897 with the premiere of Sir Arthur Sullivan's new ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\". There were a few problems with this work (it was rather over-long in its original form) and so it was thought that for a week or two, Leopoldo Fregoli could perform (he needed little in the way of permanent sets, etc.) until Sir Arthur was satisfied his work was just right. Such was Fregoli's success that it was to be late in May of that year before the Sullivan piece was finally performed.\n\nFregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski one after another. He would exit stage left as a street musician and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - wanted to see him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.\n\nWhile there is no doubt Fregoli enjoyed himself and his success, he seems to have been essentially a modest man and he did not wish to carry on in London forever. Late in May 1898 he left for Argentina, promising to be back in London the following February. Whether he did so is presently unclear. Several of his performances were later filmed.\n\nHis greatest success was in the Olympia Theatre in Paris, where he performed for more than a year. He continued to come back to Paris until 1910. He then for many years toured Italy and South America.\n\nRather suddenly, in 1922, while performing in Niterói, a city across the bay, opposite Rio de Janeiro, he decided to quit the world of quick change.\n\nHe returned to Italy and subsequently inspired Futurist theatre performers, but very little information is available about him in English. He did write an autobiography (published by Rizzoli) and was the subject of another book (Fregoli, 1867-1936. Sa vie et ses secrets by Jean Nohain, Francois Caradec and Fregoli ). The poet Joan Brossa and the painter Antoni Tàpies made an artist's book relating to Fregoli.\n\nHe is buried in Italy with the words \"His last transformation\" on his gravestone.\n\nThe Fregoli delusion or Fregoli syndrome is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature with the delusional person believing the person they believe to be in disguise is persecuting them.\n\nThe Italian magician and Quick-change artist Arturo Brachetti is one of the more classic followers of Fregoli's style. In 1979 he was the first quick change performer in the world after Fregoli. He reinvented this art and new tricks for changing. His extensive career covers a wide artistic range of versatility, acting, magic, Chinese shadows. He is listed in the Guinness World Records as the quickest and prolific performer in the world.

It is at the top of Headington Hill overlooking the city in the Thames Valley below. The life of the large residential area is centred upon London Road, the main road between London and Oxford.\n\nThe site of Headington shows evidence of continued occupation from the Stone Age, as the 2001 field excavations in Barton Lane found, suggesting a date in the 11th century BC. Pottery was found on the Manor Ground, suggesting an Iron Age settlement there in the 7th century BC. Roman kilns from about AD 300 have been found, including one now on display at the Museum of Oxford. Anglo-Saxon burial remains from about AD 500 have also been discovered.\n\nHeadington's toponym is derived from the Old English \"Hedena's dun\", meaning \"Hedena's hill\", when it was the site of a palace or hunting lodge of the Kings of Mercia. In a charter of 1004, Ethelred II of England, \"written at the royal ville called Headan dune\", gave land in Headington to Frideswide's priory, which included the quarry and the area around it.\nHenry I granted a chapel at Headington to the Augustinian canons regular of the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford, when the priory was founded in 1122. The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew was built in the middle of the 12th century and enlarged in the 13th century. The bell tower was started in the 13th or 14th century and completed in about 1500. St. Andrew's was repaired in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Gothic Revival architect J.C. Buckler restored the building and lengthened the nave in 1862–1864.\n\nHeadington developed rapidly in the early 20th century, significant amounts of housing developing around the medieval village, now known as Old Headington, around the original parish church of St Andrew. In 1927, it became an urban district separate from the Headington Rural District and in 1929 it was added to the city of Oxford. The other side of the London Road is called New Headington.\n\nOxford United were formed as Headington F.C. in 1893, adding the suffix United in 1911 after merging with Headington Quarry. Until 2001 their home ground was the Manor Ground, which had its main entrance on London Road. In 2001 Oxford United moved to the Kassam Stadium near Blackbird Leys. The Manor Ground has since been demolished and a private hospital built on the site.\n\nThe City of Oxford Silver Band began as the Headington Brass Band having been founded in the 19th century.\n\nIn 2002 a re-warding of the City created a ward called Headington representing both sides of the London Road, from Bury Knowle Park to Headley Way, with two elected representatives. The first councillors for this ward were David Rundle (2002–) and Stephen Tall (2002–2008). Ruth Wilkinson was elected to succeed Stephen Tall in May 2008, and Mohammed Altaf-Khan to succeed David Rundle in 2014.\n\nHeadington has a large and growing population. Headington's main employment sectors are medicine, education, and research. In the centre of Headington are a number of shops, pubs, cafés, restaurants, and other services. The area also includes the main campus of Oxford Brookes University, Ruskin College (which moved in its entirety from central Oxford to its Headington site in 2012), and the city's main hospitals, including the John Radcliffe, Nuffield and Churchill.\n\nHeadington's most famous modern landmark is The Headington Shark, made by John Buckley for local broadcaster Bill Heine in 1986.\n\nHeadington has a number of green spaces including Headington Hill and Bury Knowle parks. Close by is Shotover Hill, a heath and woodland area with views over Oxfordshire, and listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Warneford Meadow a wild grassland, bought in 1918 by public subscription for the adjacent Warneford Hospital, has been registered as a Town Green and has thus escaped development.\n\nHeadington has a non-league football team, Headington Amateurs, who play at the Barton Recreation Ground. Oxford United traditionally also played in the area at the Manor Ground: indeed they were originally known as Headington United. However they moved to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, leaving Headington behind.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, author of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", lived at 76 Sandfield Road in Headington from 1953 until 1968.\n\nC. S. Lewis, author of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", moved to the district in 1921 (he was born in Northern Ireland in 1898) and lived there until moving to The Kilns at nearby Risinghurst in 1930. He lived there until his death in 1963. Lewis is buried at Holy Trinity Church at Headington Quarry.\n\nElizabeth Jennings, a renowned poet, spent her latter years living at Unity House (8 St Andrew's Lane), which was formerly the home of Emily Ann Yockney, the sister of Lord Nuffield (William Morris).\n\nA more recent resident was John Simpson, senior editor of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". A number of Oxford academics have lived in Headington over the years. They include Lord Krebs, David Marquand and Anthony Kenny. Sir Isaiah Berlin, the historian A. B. Emden, the chemist Dalziel Hammick, Lord Elton, Michael Ernest Sadler and John Johnson (the University Printer) were also among them. Others included the author Elizabeth Bowen, Robert Maxwell and Lord Nuffield (William Morris) and Anne Diamond, the television presenter and author. Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer, lived in Old Headington until his death in 2017. Emma Watson, Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter films, lives in Headington. She also attended Headington School. Joan Clarke Murray, one of the Enigma code breakers, lived at 7 Larkfields from about 1991 until her death in 1996.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located East of Mangalore city center. BC Road-Kaikamba of Bantwal is one of the fastest developing areas in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka. Along with BC Road-Kaikamba, Panemangalore & Melkar regions are also urbanized. They are also developing as the eastern suburbs of Mangalore. Towards east of Mangalore, the stretch upto BC Road-Kaikamba region forms a continuous Mangalore Urban Agglomeration area which is currently the second biggest in Karnataka after Bangalore. Bantwal is the fourth largest urban area in Dakshina Kannada district after Mangalore, Ullal (both comes under Mangalore Urban Agglomeration area) & Puttur in terms of population.\n\nBantwal town is often called Vatapura Kshetra by some communities. Bantwal means Banta Wala, which means where Bunts live in Tulu language. It is situated on the banks of River Nethravati on the National Highway - 73. The adjacent town of B.C. Road (Bantwal Cross Road) serves as the commercial center.\n\nPreviously, the town of Bantwal was known for trade with the Persian Gulf states, being so close to Mangalore. However, flooding caused by the river Netravathi during the monsoons compelled traders and newer settlements to move to the adjacent city of B.C. Road due to its higher altitude. Gradually, most Government offices shifted to B.C. Road.\n\nPrior to 1852, Bantwal Taluk was the largest taluk in the entire of Canara Province (then comprising North Canara, Udupi, Mangalore and Kasaragod Districts) with 411 villages and a total population of 1,69,416. In 1852, a portion of it was formed into the Taluk of Puttur. Bantwal was an entrepot for the produce of the province on its way to the Mysore Country and had derived a great benefit of late years from the extension of the coffee trade. It contained about thousand scattered houses inhabited by Billava, Bunts, Bhandary, Ganigas, Kulals, Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Konkani Catholics and a few Jains.\n\n India census, Bantwal had a population of 36,829. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Bantwal has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 76% of the males and 72% of females literate. 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. tulu language is the main language spoken here. In addition to Kannada, Konkani and the town also has Beary speaking populations.\n\nAccording to the 2011 India census, Hindus make up 61.27% of total population, Muslims 32.47% and Christians 5.95%.\n\nThe town is still considered an important trade center for groceries, tobacco, hardware and gold.\n\nBantwal is located along the coast of river Netravathi. Every year due to heavy rains the river floods. The taluk is flanked by the state of Kerala in the south, and the towns of Belthangady and Puttur in the east, the city of Mangalore in the west and Karkala in the north. It covers an area of about 720 km square. National Highway 73 cuts through B. C. Road. The highway serves as the conduit for several arterial routes leading to neighboring towns with Mangalore. Mangalore is connected with other cities in Karnataka such as Mysore and Bangalore via NH-73. It is well connected to Uppala through Uppala-Mudipu-Bantwal Highway.\n\nThe Grama Panchayats in Bantwal taluk are Golthamajalu, Kolnadu, Sajipa Muda, Kurnadu, Maani, Navooru, Pudu, Sangabettu, Amtady, Maavinakatte, Sarapady, Thumbe, Veerakumba and Vittla (Vittal).\nThe Netravati River passes through the taluka. Water supply to Mangalore city is provided by a vented dam at Thumbe to Netravathi. There is a bridge over the Netravati river at Panemangalore.\n\nSome other places in Bantwal taluk of interest are Kadeshivalaya, Ajilamogaru, Alike, Karanje, Naraharibetta, Nandavara, Modankap, Agrar and Loretto.\n\nMany buses ply to nearby places such as Mudipu, Moodabidri, Surathkal, Mulki, Kinnigoli, Vitla operate from the B.

It provided a link over the River Itchen and water meadows, from the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DN&SR), to the LSWR's main line. The DN&SR was originally intended to continue down the east side of the Itchen to Southampton, but had stalled at Winchester due to lack of funds. The viaduct crossed the valley to link the DN&SR to the LSWR, which ran (and still runs) down the west side of the valley.\n\nThe viaduct was last used by the railway on 2 April 1966. The line it carried closed as a result of the Beeching Axe, although all of it, with the exception of a few bricks on the walls, is still standing and is open to walkers and cyclists. It forms part of the National Cycle Network Route 23.\n\nThe structure has 33 spans. Although it appears to be a brick structure, the viaduct in fact has a solid concrete core in its pillars, with the bricks simply performing an aesthetic function. The bricks came from the Poole Brickworks in Wellington, Somerset, and the blue engineering capping bricks from Blanchards at Bishop's Waltham. It was long suspected that the viaduct's structure contained concrete, but not until recent borings into the structure were made was it realised that the majority of the bridge was made of the material. This makes it amongst the earliest modern structures to have a solid concrete core.\n\nUnsuccessful attempts have been made to have the structure listed in order to attract National Lottery funding to assist in its preservation. The structure is of some historic interest due to its method of construction, and the importance of the route in the lead up to D-Day. It also provides a footpath and cycleway across the Itchen, and acts as a partial screen between the water meadows and the elevated M3 motorway at the foot of Twyford Down. In 2007 Winchester City Council announced a £500,000 rolling programme of repairs over 12 years. However the City Council had held back on any repairs since Sustrans was interested in taking over the Viaduct as part of its Hampshire cycle route system. In March 2012 Hampshire County Council provided a further £250,000 in funding to assist in bringing the viaduct into use as part of National Cycle Route 23, running between Reading and the Isle of Wight. Restoration was undertaken by the combined expertise of Sustrans, Winchester City Council and Hampshire County Council. The Friends of Hockley Viaduct provided a replacement home signal and its lattice post, and an original nearby telegraph post has been restored and re-erected. Sustrans has signed a 40year maintenance contract with the City Council.\n\nThe newly restored Hockley Viaduct was officially opened on 26 February 2013 by the World Champion cyclist Dani King, born and brought up in Eastleigh. Over 100 invited guests attended a display concerning the history and restoration of the Viaduct in Winchester Guildhall before either cycling to the Viaduct alongside Dani King or riding down to it in a King Alfred Buses double decker for the official opening. A red ribbon, held by Winchester Mayor Frank Pearson and former Councillor George Beckett, was breasted by Dani and her entourage.\n\n"}

Again the material was only loosely sketched and we didn't really have any idea how the album would turn out. We'd spent a month or so getting the ideas together living in a small house in the Lake District of England and rehearsing the ideas in a school hall, specially hired, just outside the village of Hawkshead\".\n\nThe first single from the album was \"Tears\", released on 1 June 1986.\n\n\"Strange Times\" was released 1 September 1986 on the Geffen label. Initial American pressings of the record came with a bonus 12\" with six additional tracks, two of which are covers. The American cassette also had the same bonus tracks, split up so that each side of the cassette contained half of the bonus tracks. The record did not have a \"B\" side; it was credited as Side A and Side A+.\n\nThe album was never released on CD in any territory until 1993. Although Geffen released it as a two-disc set with all of the bonus tracks in the UK and Germany, the decision was made to omit one of the bonus tracks (\"Ever After\") from the American version to facilitate its release on a single disc.\n\nThe album's second single, \"Swamp Thing\", was released on the same day as the album.\n\n\"Strange Times\" was praised by the critics who reviewed it. Ian Gittins of \"Melody Maker\" called it \"a marvellous departure\" from their previous work and \"a wonderful record\". Robert Palmer of \"The New York Times\" described it as \"the band's most inventive and winning album yet and as a fine a record as any pop-rock guitar band has made this year. [...] it should delight just about anyone\".\n\nBurgess later said, \"\"Strange Times\" is my favourite. Personally, I believe it was the best lyrical work I'd done with the band and some of the best vocal performances, and I think the Chameleons really began to mature and move forward with this album\".\n\nIn a post on his Instagram account on 22 March 2018, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher cited \"Strange Times\" as an early influence on his songwriting: “...I’d forgotten how much this album meant to me. It came out in ‘86. I was 19!! I've been listening to it every day since and I have to say it's blown my mind..again! It must have influenced my early years as a song writer because I can hear ME in it everywhere!!...”\n\n\n\n"}

She is a recipient of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Grossman now lives in New York City. She received a B.A. and M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, did graduate work at UC Berkeley, and received a Ph.D. from New York University. Her career as a translator began when in 1972 a friend, Jo-Anne Engelbert, asked her to translate a story for a collection of short works by the Argentine avant-garde writer Macedonio Fernández. Grossman subsequently changed the focus of her work from scholarship and criticism to translation.\n\nIn a speech delivered at the 2003 PEN Tribute to Gabriel García Márquez, in 2003, she explained her method:\nGrossman's translation of Miguel de Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\", published in 2003, is considered one of the finest English-language translations of the Spanish novel, by authors and critics including Carlos Fuentes and Harold Bloom, who called her \"the Glenn Gould of translators, because she, too, articulates every note.\" However, the reaction from Cervantes scholars has been more critical. Tom Lathrop, himself a translator of \"Don Quixote\", critiqued her translation in the journal of the Cervantes Society of America, saying: Both Lathrop and Daniel Eisenberg criticize her for a poor choice of Spanish edition as source, leading to inaccuracies; Eisenberg adds that \"she is the most textually ignorant of the modern translators\".\n\nShe received the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation in 2006.

He was a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese or Modern English style, both of which originated in England and had long-lasting international influence.\n\nDresser was born in Glasgow, Scotland, of a Yorkshire family. At age 13, he began attending the Government School of Design, Somerset House, London. He received training in design and took botany as his specialization. He lectured on the new subject of Art Botany to complete his studies before his appointment in 1855 as Professor of Artistic Botany in the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington.\nHe wrote a series of articles that appeared in the \"Art Journal\" in 1857, \"Botany as Adapted to the Arts and Art Manufactures\". In 1858 he sold his first designs.\n\nIn 1850 the University of Jena, Germany, where Schleiden held the chair, granted a conventional doctorate to Dresser on his submission of his books \"Rudiments of Botany \"(1859) and\" Unity in Variety \"(1859) and a short paper on plant structure; as Dresser did not attend the university his doctorate was awarded \"in absentia.\"\nFrom this early date his design work widened to include carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, and textiles printed and woven. He claimed to have designed \"as much as any man\" at the International Exhibition London 1862. As early as 1865 the \"Building News\" reported that in the early part of his career he had been active as a designer of wallpapers, textiles and carpets, and the most active revolutioniser in the decorative art of the day.\nHe wrote several books on design and ornament, including \"The Art of Decorative Design\" (1862), \"The Development of Ornamental Art in the International Exhibition\" (1862), and \"Principles of Design\" (1873), which was addressed in the preface to \"working men\". In 1899 \"The Studio \"magazine found it was possible to quote this book \"page after page and not find a line, scarcely a word, that would not be endorsed by the most critical member of the Arts and Crafts Association today.\" In effect Dresser set the agenda adopted by the Arts and Crafts movement at a later date.\n\nIn 1873 he was requested by the American Government to write a report on the design of household goods.\n\nEn route for Japan in 1876 he delivered a series of three lectures in the Philadelphia Museum and School of Industrial Art and supervised the manufacture of wallpapers to his design for Wilson Fennimore. He was commissioned by Messrs Tiffany of New York to form a collection, whilst in Japan, of art objects both old and new that should illustrate the manufactures of that country.\n\nIn four months in 1876/1877 Dresser travelled about 2000 miles in Japan, recording his impressions in \"Japan, its Architecture, Art and Art-Manufactures\". He represented the South Kensington Museum whilst in Japan, and was received at court by the Emperor, who ordered Dresser to be treated as a guest of the nation – all doors were open to him. He was requested by the Japanese Government to write a report on 'Trade with Europe'. His pioneering study of Japanese art is evident in much of his work which is considered typical of the Anglo-Japanese style.\n\nFrom 1879 to 1882 Dresser was in partnership with Charles Holme (1848–1923) as Dresser & Holme, wholesale importers of Oriental goods, with a warehouse at 7 Farringdon Road, London, next door to those of the American inventor and abolitionist, Thaddeus Hyatt (1816–1901).\n\nBetween 1879 and 1882, as Art Superintendent at the Linthorpe Art Pottery in Linthorpe in Middlesbrough he designed over 1,000 pots. If his ceramic work from the 1860s onwards (for firms such as Mintons, Wedgwood, Royal Worcester, Watcombe, Linthorpe, Old Hall at Hanley and Ault) is considered, he must be amongst the most influential ceramic designers of any period. Much of his other work remains to be identified, although wallpaper designs for American, and textiles for French and German manufacturers have recently been located. A significant Dresser collection is held by the Dorman Museum in Middlesbrough. A Heritage Lottery Funded project draws attention to this.\n\nSome of Dresser’s metalwork designs are still in production, such as his oil and vinegar sets and toast rack designs, now manufactured by Alessi. Alberto Alessi goes so far as to say Dresser 'knew the techniques of metal production better than any designer who has come to Alessi'.\n\nOne of his Old Hall designs is thought to have inspired Alan Garner's 1967 novel \"The Owl Service\".\n\nOn a design note: Christopher Dresser is not Art Deco. It is many years before the Art Deco style started but is quite often confused as such.\n\n\n"}

They chat about Buffy's nervousness about her new job and the struggle she may face while trying to balance her Slayer job with her duties as a school counselor. In one of the caskets, the three find a deceased woman that they suspect of being a vampire, and rightfully so, as the woman comes to life and is promptly staked. At the high school the next day, Buffy talks with various students who all have their own problems, including trouble with bullies and violence, anxiety, homosexuality and plain boredom. Willow and Xander walk together and talk about Buffy's struggles and Willow's worries about her role in dealing with the impending Hellmouth danger. With Xander's support, Willow walks towards Tara's grave.\n\nBuffy talks with more students, including her own sister, but one girl, Cassie Newton, stuns Buffy when she confesses that she's going to die next Friday and that there will be lots of coins. As she leaves for class, Cassie compliments Buffy's shirt and warns her against spilling something on it. Buffy reports Cassie to Principal Wood, but he's not as helpful as she'd like. After spilling coffee onto her white shirt, Buffy is apprehensive and sends Dawn to befriend Cassie. Dawn catches up with Cassie and they talk about Cassie's friend Mike, who has continuously asked Cassie to an upcoming dance and been rejected every time.\n\nWillow investigates Cassie on the computer, and finds Cassie's website filled with sad, morbid poetry. Though Buffy is convinced that Cassie has a precognitive ability and given up hope for survival, Xander and Willow are both skeptical despite all the experiences they had with the paranormal. Dawn returns home from school and thinks the reason for Cassie's problem is Mike, but Buffy and the others don't pay much attention. Willow finds a website on Cassie's father that shows his troubled past with the law and alcohol. Buffy and Xander visit Cassie's father and confront him with their suspicion that he may get drunk and hurt his daughter. Mr. Newton confidently denies the accusation after he goes on about how his ex-wife only allows him to spend one weekend a month with his daughter. Buffy then finds out that Mr. Newton's weekend with Cassie was the previous one, therefore not only does he not have the chance to hurt Cassie, but if Cassie's prediction is true, then he will not see her again before her death. Satisfied that Mr. Newton is not involved, Buffy and Xander leave and bump into Cassie. She had been waiting for them outside of her father's house, and although she appreciates Buffy's efforts to find the cause, she knows there's nothing Buffy can do. Xander asks her if she's planning to kill herself, but Cassie denies it. She talks about all the things she wishes she could do and makes it clear that she doesn't want to die; it's just what is going to happen on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of guys in red cloaks walk around a circle and burn pictures of Cassie on a tray in the middle. Still motivated to help Cassie, Buffy reads poetry from Cassie's site and continues to investigate with the rest of the gang despite Xander and Willow's skepticism, and Dawn becomes close with Cassie and Mike. Buffy goes to the school basement and asks a still insane Spike if he knows anything about Cassie. He doesn't. As Buffy turns to leave, Spike asks her to stay, but she tells him that her presence seems to worsen his condition and leaves.\n\nUpstairs, Principal Wood and another administrator search through student lockers for anything suspicious. Buffy catches Mike in the halls and stops him to see if he may have intentions of hurting Cassie because she rejected him. He makes it clear he doesn't mind, and is thinking about asking Dawn to the dance instead. Coins fall from one of the lockers, drawing Buffy's attention. Buffy takes one of the coins and the number of the locker where they came from and talks to the student the locker belongs to. The student confesses that some of his friends want to hurt Cassie.\n\nDawn and Cassie walk away from the school as Cassie reveals how she knows Buffy sent Dawn to befriend Cassie. However, Cassie then states that it doesn't matter as the two are now clearly real friends. Just then a student named Peter approaches, and Cassie, knowing she won't see Dawn again, tells Dawn that nothing that is about to happen is her fault. Peter asks Dawn about the dance, but not to ask her to go with him. When an irritated Dawn turns back toward Cassie, she is gone. At the school that night, the cloaked group gathers again around a circle of coins and one of the boys reveals to be Peter. He checks with the others to make sure the school is secure and that no one can get in or out. Then, he pulls a bound, blindfolded and gagged Cassie out to the circle and holds a meat cleaver to her neck. She is to be sacrificed to a demon that will provide the boys with \"infinite riches\".\n\nAs Peter starts the ritual, Buffy reveals herself as one of the cloaked people. She doesn't think the ritual was a success, but a large demon appears behind her, proving her wrong. Buffy fights the demon and Spike shows up with a flaming torch to help, having temporarily regained his sanity. Buffy uses the torch to burn the demon while Spike cuts Cassie free from her bonds. After he rips her gag off, Cassie says to him, \"Someday she'll tell you.\" Desperately, Peter drags himself toward the fried demon, demanding his money. The burned demon leans up and bites Peter on the shoulder once before exploding into dust.\n\nBuffy and Cassie walk away together, leaving Peter on his own. A crossbow booby trap set by one of the cloaked boys nearly kills Cassie, but Buffy stops the bolt. Buffy tells Cassie that one person can make a difference, to which Cassie responds, \"And you will,\" before gasping and falling to the ground, dead.\n\nThe next day, the Scooby Gang gathers at Revello Drive and solemnly talks about how Cassie died because of a congenital heart defect. She was always going to die, no matter what happened, and Cassie knew that Buffy would be at her side when her prediction came true. Buffy feels that she has failed, but a devastated Dawn corrects her, saying Buffy didn't fail since she tried to save Cassie; it was because of her that Dawn and Cassie were friends. The gang are now convinced as Buffy of Cassie's unique gift; they all sadly realize that even though they may be able to avert outcomes, but not on fate. Buffy returns to work, knowing that while she will always try her best, sometimes she just can't help anyone.\n\n\n"}

It broadcasts at 95.1 MHz FM and streams online at WVUR's website. The station features a range of students, staff, members of the public, and faculty members who contribute to the station. Each semester some students participate with the Source on a regular basis, making it one of the largest organizations on campus. The Source plays a wide variety of music including rock, alternative, jazz, punk, airhorn, and indie. Many students have specialty shows in which they play their own mix in addition to the regular automated rotation. WVUR Sports is an integral part of the station. Hundreds of VU Athletics games are broadcast each year on the air and online. The Evening Source also exists, providing the area with news at five pm.\n\nThe Source 95 is an entirely student-operated variety station. Its primary programming is music, which includes a standard rotation based on a combination of standard alternative fare and the CMJ Top 200/Indie/College Radio format, other genre-specific shows, and free-form shows during evenings and weekends. The station also includes talk with \"The Morning Show\" and news and weather with periodic updates throughout all programming, as well as \"The Evening Source\" news show. Programming also includes more than 100 sports broadcasts per year. \"WVUR Sports\" broadcasts Valparaiso University sporting events live on the air and on the WVUR online webcast.\n\nThe station won Indiana Association of Student Broadcasters awards in recent years, including Radio School of the Year in 2006, 2008, and 2010.\n\nIn May 1949, a group of students submitted a proposal to the Valparaiso University Board of Directors to build an educational FM radio station in the basement of Guild Hall. However, after ten years without progress, VU law school student Jack Lawson led a committee to plan a radio station. With the help of DePauw University radio station WGRE, the committee obtained information necessary to found a radio station. After experimenting in November 1959 with a closed-circuit station nicknamed \"WPRX\" reaching only Wehrenberg Hall, President O. P. Kretzmann addressed the student body at 11 p.m. on November 11, 1960, on 600 AM. The low-power station broadcast out of Benton Hall and reached all but one dormitory. WVUR's first six years included transmission via telephone cables, and in 1966 WVUR became the first FM station in the city of Valparaiso, operating on frequency 89.5.\n\nPermission was granted in February 1961 to construct a non-commercial educational FM station. Due to legal concerns, the station was turned over from the students to the administration. Though this move sparked heavy opposition, the transition began during the 1965–1966 academic year. On September 25, 1966, the FCC granted a license to WVUR-FM 89.5 MHz \"The Voice\", making it the first radio station in the city of Valparaiso. The studio was still located in Benton Hall and included a new lounge nicknamed \"The Penthouse\". The studios relocated to Heimlich Hall during the 1970–1971 academic year and moved again to the Journalism Center on January 11, 1978. On September 24, 1982, a new tower was constructed atop Brandt Hall, which brought increased wattage and the station's current frequency and name: WVUR 95.1 FM \"The Source\".\n\nIn August 1998, WVUR relocated to Schnabel Hall. In 1999, the station began web streaming sporting events. During the 2001–2002 academic year, the station upgraded to a computer automated system and commenced broadcasting 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, including during all academic breaks. The station also began taking requests by phone. In 2017 the station removed its on-air phone and thus stopped taking requests by phone.\n\nIn 2006, WVUR began posting podcasts, media from concerts, and assorted other media such as station-made remixes on its website. On January 16, 2007, the station added a modern rock/alternative format to complement the current CMJ Indie rotation. Fall Out Boy's This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race was the first official song to play in the new format.\n\nIn 2012, WVUR started to stream its full broadcast online 24/7, expanding the sports-only stream to include music, talk, and all other programming. The Source officially began full streaming at 9:51 a.m. on May 2, 2012. The first song officially played both on the air and online in this new era was Foster The People's Don't Stop (Color on the Walls).\n\nIn 2015, new general manager Andrew Whitmyer found the format insufficient for the station's needs and switched to a full mix station.\n\n\n"}

Buffy tries to convince a reluctant Xander that Spike needs their help and a place better than the basement to live. Spike's just about as reluctant as Xander, but Buffy thinks this plan is the right thing for him. Buffy and Dawn talk privately about Buffy's feelings for Spike and why she's helping him in light of the pain he's caused her. Dawn starts to rant about love and relationships and Buffy leaves so she can return to work. An attractive jock on the football field then catches Dawn's attention and she falls off the bleachers while distracted by him.\n\nBuffy fights with and kills a demon at Anya's apartment that was sent by D'Hoffryn. Anya thanks her for the help, but doesn't want it to seem like she needs help. Buffy explains that the gang needs Anya's help and she wants to protect her friends, Anya included. At the high school, Dawn prepares to confront her dream guy, named R.J., and once she finds him, she tries to start up a conversation with him. He's with another player, O'Donnell, and two cheerleaders talking about cheerleader tryouts and most of Dawn's awkward comments don't quite fit with the crowd. Later, Dawn tries out for the cheerleading team wearing Buffy's old cheerleading uniform, but she falls and makes a fool out of herself. At home that night, Dawn locks herself in the bathroom and cuts up the cheerleading uniform while Buffy tries to get her to come out.\n\nBuffy tries to offer help and support, but considering Buffy's track record with guys, Dawn isn't interested. The next day at school, Dawn overhears O'Donnell inform R.J. that he won't be starting quarterback for the game and she confronts O'Donnell. She yells at him at first, but then in a moment of anger, she shoves him and he falls down a flight of stairs. Dawn has a meeting with Principal Wood and Buffy about the incident and informs them that the jock just tripped and fell down the stairs. Buffy realizes though that Dawn may have been motivated by her love for R.J. and actually pushed O'Donnell down the stairs.\n\nR.J. catches up with Dawn after her meeting and they talk then R.J. invites her out on a date. At the Bronze, the gang sit around and talk about Spike's progress at Xander's place as they spot R.J. dancing with a \"slutty-looking\" girl. They're all beyond shocked when they see that the girl is Dawn. Buffy confronts her sister and lays down the law about Dawn's clothes and behavior, but Dawn puts up quite a fight for her right to do whatever she wants. Unable to get past Buffy to return to the dance floor, Dawn leaves and encounters one of the cheerleader girls in the alley. They begin to fight over R.J. and have to be broken up by Buffy.\n\nBuffy watches as Principal Wood lectures R.J. about not doing his own homework and then Buffy catches him for another lecture. She gets on his case about the way he's treating girls but, quickly, something comes over Buffy and she starts to swoon over him like a lovesick schoolgirl. Buffy catches Dawn as she returns home that night and tells her about her meeting with R.J. Buffy offers encouragement to her sister by explaining that she has a chance with R.J. and that he really likes her.\n\nAt school the next day, Buffy pulls R.J. out of class and takes him to an empty room. While Dawn walks the halls peeking into rooms in search of R.J., Buffy adoringly listens to R.J. talk about football and his troubles at school and then starts kissing him just as Dawn peeks into the room. Dawn runs outside in tears and into Xander. He tries to comfort her, but realizes that Buffy would possibly be more help and goes to find her. He's surprised to find her on top of R.J. and promptly takes her home for a much needed intervention with the others. At the Summers house that night, Buffy and Dawn fight about their love with R.J., while Xander, Willow and Anya try to keep the peace until they can reverse the love spell obviously affecting the sisters.\n\nWillow searches for information on R.J. and instead finds information on R.J.'s older brother, Lance, who Xander remembers from high school. Xander and Spike go to find R.J.'s brother and despite his popular status at high school, he isn't quite his attractive, popular self anymore. After some chatting, the guys realize that R.J.'s jacket has been handed down through the family. R.J. shows up at Buffy's house looking for her, but Willow and Anya tell him to leave. As R.J. walks away, Willow and Anya start to look at him lovingly and then argue about which of them he loves more. Buffy and Dawn jump into the fight, and soon Dawn is hurt and depressed that her friends and sister are taking her guy away, while the other three plot to win R.J. Buffy goes to kill Principal Wood (who had disciplined R.J.), Willow works on a spell to make R.J. a woman, Anya takes off to rob banks and Dawn lays herself across the railroad tracks.\n\nXander stops Willow from completing her spell, and then brings her along to stop Buffy from killing Principal Wood with her old rocket launcher. Spike tackles Buffy before she can kill the principal, and although she puts up a fight, he gets the weapon away from her. Using Willow's locator spell, they find Dawn on the railroad tracks just as a train is headed for her. Buffy jumps in and rescues her sister just before the train hits; scared at the thought of losing her sister, Buffy shows that the spell wasn't that strong, and admits that she's willing to give up R.J. if it means that much to Dawn. Finally, Xander and Spike jump R.J. on the street and steal his jacket, then burn it in the fireplace at the Summers home. All the girls feel terrible about the way they acted and the things they almost did, while Xander remembers an incident he had with a love spell in \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\". Willow questions what Anya did to prove her love to R.J.; Anya dodges the subject with a quick lie and turns off the radio as a news report is heard about a wanted bank robber on the loose.\n"}
{"id": "2272003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272003", "title": "Barèges", "text": "Barèges\n\nBarèges (; , Gascon dialect: \"Barètge\") is a French commune in the Hautes-Pyrénées department in the Occitania region of south-western France. It is situated in the valley of the Bastan on the former Route nationale 618 (the \"Route of the Pyrénées\") on the western side of the Col du Tourmalet.\n\nIts spa has been known since the beginning of the 17th century and is the highest in the Pyrenees. It is famous also for the ski resort of Barèges, part of the \"Domaine du Tourmalet\", as well as its landscapes.\n\nThe inhabitants of the commune are known as \"Barégeois\" () or \"Barégeoises\" ().\n\nBarèges village is a small mountain village in the French Pyrenees located in the heart of the \"Val de la Batsus\" at the foot of the Col du Tourmalet and the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, which stretches along the right bank of the \"Bastan\". The commune is located some 20 km south of Bagneres-de-Bigorre and 12 km north-west of Aragnouet.\n\nThe town is bounded in the north-west by the \"Bastan\" river which flows from east to west in a narrow valley through the main village (at an altitude of 1250 m) and through its main inhabited areas. The Bastan forms the northern border of the commune with the commune of Sers.\nThe rest of the territory of the commune is mostly a vast plateau surrounded by several peaks that form most of its other borders with:\n\nThe village sits on the D918 road, which to the west leads down the valley to Lourdes, Tarbes and Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées Airport. To the north-east, the road continues up the valley to the Col du Tourmalet and onwards to Arreau and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.\n\nThe Bastan river, known locally as the \"Gave de Bastan\", is a right tributary of the \"Gave de Gavarnie\" and has its source in the north-east of the commune near the Col du Tourmalet whose slopes and the slopes of the surrounding peaks supply water. The Ruisseau d'Aygues Cluses rises in the south-east of the commune and flows north to join the Bastan. The Ruisseau de la Glère flows north from the Lac de la Glère in the south-west of the commune to join the Bastan east of the village. Two small streams rise south of the village and flow north to join the Bastan: the Ruisseau de Rioulet and the Ruisseau du Pontis.\n\nThe mountainous plateau that forms the largest area of the commune is dotted with small lakes that feed the streams flowing to the Bastan.\n\nIn February 2013 an avalanche blocked the Bastan at the height of the Barèges Spa and the town was evacuated. On 31 May 2013 snow accumulated and there was an avalanche below the Lienz which covered nearly 200 metres of the bed of the Bastan. After a heatwave on 15 and 16 June followed by thunderstorms and incessant rain on 17 and 18 June there was rising water associated with snow melt. Hampered by the remains of the avalanche, the waters of the Bastan overflowed the road on the right bank, the Place de Barèges (Town Square), then the HLM parking, camping area, and seven houses but there were no injuries reported. The Thermal Baths of Barzun were also heavily damaged. The stricken town was evacuated on June 19 through an unusual opening of the Col du Tourmalet which is always under snow.\n\nIn the 7th century the people of Barèges Valley were subjected to women - there was a custom that men served their wives with all marks of respect.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Corbeil in 1258, James I of Aragon renounced his claim to Occitania inherited from his ancestors, the Counts of Barcelona. In return King Louis IX of France agreed to waive his own claims to the Catalan counties. Effectively, as the descendants of Charlemagne, the kings of France have always retained their rights over the old Marca Hispanica. OIn this way the \"Vallée libre de Barèges\" (Free Valley of Barèges) was established.\n\nAdministratively, the town of Bains was a dependency of the village of Betpouey located downstream on the Bastan. A small mountain village was built around a thermal springs. It is not known when its hot springs were discovered. Tradition has it that the shepherds were the first users. They had noticed that sick or injured sheep came to soak in the hot and sulphurous waters.\n\nIts warm sulphurous waters first became generally known in 1675 when they were visited by Madame de Maintenon and Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine, son of Louis XIV.\n\nThe commune owes its current name to Madame de Maintenon who, during her stay in 1675 in the village of Bains, dated her letters \"Barèges\" although that designation belonged to the whole Barèges Valley or, in the political sense, the valley of Bastan and that of the Gave de Gavarnie. The town was just called \"Les Bains\" in reference to its thermal baths.\n\nIn 1680 Louvois, Secretary of State and Minister of State for Louis XIV came to the Barèges Baths to treat a leg fracture. On returning to Versailles he obtained credits from Colbert for the first military hospital for the comfort of hydrotherapy.\n\nIn 1762 a flood from the Bastan took away 17 houses in the small spa town.\n\nBarèges appears as \"Bareges les Bains\" on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.\n\nIn 1946 the old town of \"Bains\", now more commonly known as simply \"Barèges\", was separated from its former parent of Betpouey as the interests of Betpouey and the tourism in Barèges did not match. In addition the remoteness of the village made administrative tasks difficult, especially in winter due to new activities in the development of winter sports. The commune of Barèges was then created retaining the simple name popularized by Madame de Maintenon and the subsequent success of its thermal baths.\nFollowing very heavy rain (with a red meteorological vigilance rating for Flood in the department) linked to late melting of most of the winter snow, the village of Barèges was seriously damaged on 18 and 19 June 2013. The Bastan river overflowed so violently that several buildings and parts of roads were destroyed with the cutting of electricity and telephone services. No deaths were however reported. The President of the Republic, François Hollande, visited to see the damage on 7 July 2013.\n\nList of Successive Mayors\n\nIn 2010 the commune had 201 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1946. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.\n\nBarèges is situated at the perimeter of the National Parc of the Pyrénées. In and around the village all mountain sports are practiced, such as paragliding, walking, cycling, canyoning/caving, mountain climbing, mountain biking, and more.\n\nBarèges is also the second oldest ski resort in France, and when the funicular was opened in 1936 the resort became a tourist destination. The resort, now linked with La Mongie, is the largest ski area in the French Pyrénées.\n\nThe historic Funicular of Ayré started from the centre of Barèges and had an intermediate stop on the height of the plateau of Lienz. Later in 1947 it was extended and allowed to reach an altitude of 2005 m on the northern flank of Ayré Peak (which rises to 2416 m). In the early 1950s Électricité de France (EDF) implanted a huge construction site a little higher still (at 150 m below the top of the Ayré) to make an 11 km long tunnel to store water from the Néouvielle massif and from the Gavarnie for the Capdelong Dam and bring them through the mountains to the Pragnères hydroelectric plant. The existing funicular could not be extended and a cable car was built by EDF, first for its own use to connect to the tunnel construction site base camp and the refuge of Glère nearby (the remains of the tunnel construction and the base camp have not yet, in 2013, been cleaned).\n\nWith the development of tourism, the EDF cable car was then slightly modified to be also used by skiers and hikers visiting the refuge. When the piste which now descends to the refuge was established in the early 1980s, the cable car, which was no longer used for the transportation of engineers controlling the work (who were much less numerous than during construction) was downgraded. When it no longer met safety standards and it was no longer necessary to go to the refuge due to the new piste, the cable car was stopped completely and dismantled in the 1990s.\n\nThe old Funicular of Ayré was also closed in 2000 due to aging structures and safety, despite the maintenance and modernization of buildings and equipment that had taken place over the decades. As of 2013 it has not reopened but a new project is being supported by the council, much of the population, and the friends of the station to restore the structures and aging equipment to modern standards (this is the largest and most expensive part of the work required excluding the subsequent operating costs), to modernise and diversify activities in the resort, and to reopen year round tourism.\n\nA cable car (1954–1968) and then a Gondola lift (1968–2002) also connected Barèges to Laquette (altitude 1715 m). As it no longer met safety standards it was removed. The only vestige of the cable car is the departure station on the right bank of Bastan above Barèges in the Aygat locality which was also used for the Gondola lift going up to the plateau of Lienz.\n\nIn order to ski since 2002 the ascent has been by car or bus from the D918 road (along the Bastan) to the departure point for the lifts at \"Tournaboup\" which has been built with ample parking, ticketing, and an ESF office. It is sometimes possible to access \"Super Barèges\" via the Col du Tourmalet (the road is often closed in winter or requires special equipment). The pass road is dangerous and the small resort does not allow extended parking for numerous ski vehicles so this station has been closed to non-resident passenger vehicles which must remain parked at Tournaboup and reach Super Barèges by the Caoubère and Tourmalet chairlifts which connect Barèges to La Mongie.\n\nBarèges-Gavarnie is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for French Mutton. This AOC was created in 2003.\n\n\"Barège\" is a type of goat wool which was originally made in Barèges. The undercoat from the goat fleeces yield a kind of lightweight wool and used as a Cashmere wool for a particular weave in gowns, scarves, and necklaces.\n\nBarèges gowns are cited by Victor Hugo in \"Les Misérables\", and in both \"Madame Bovary\" and \"Sentimental Education\" by Gustave Flaubert.\n\nGeorge Sand wrote on 28 August 1825, when in Bagneres-de-Bigorre, in a letter to her mother: \"Je vous porterais du barège de Barèges\" (I would bring you some barège from Barèges).\n\nFrom upstream to downstream on the Bastan:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the only episode other than \"Once More, with Feeling\" where the title appears on screen.\n\nSeveral encounters take place around Sunnydale on one night, which are told in real time. Uniquely among \"Buffy\" episodes, the main characters do not interact with one another. According to the staff writers, this was intended to enforce the idea of \"being alone.\" \n\nOn patrol, Buffy discovers that her latest vampire foe is an old high school classmate named Holden Webster. Upon recognizing her, \"Webs\" stops their fight and takes on a friendly demeanor – seeming pleasantly surprised to have run into her and asking how she has been. Because she doesn't immediately remember him, Webs begins to jog her memory about the half dozen times they interacted with each other. Buffy finally recalls him, and the two begin to reminisce. The vampire, a psychology major in life, proceeds to psychoanalyze Buffy, and she opens up to him about her innermost conflicts and problems while at the same time fighting. She slays him in the end, but not before he identifies Spike as the vampire who (recently) sired him.\n\nBack at Revello Drive, Dawn prepares for a night alone at home. An unnaturally loud banging sets her nerves on edge. She talks with her friend Kit on the phone, asking, \"See? Do you hear that?\" when the banging begins again.

Dawn manages to exorcise the malevolent force and Joyce appears to warn her that when the time comes, Buffy won't choose her.\n\nIn a story entirely devoid of dialogue, Spike picks up a woman at a bar, walks her home, and feeds on her, leaving her dead on her own doorstep.\n\nJonathan and Andrew return from Mexico to dig up an artifact hidden near the Hellmouth. Andrew is secretly in contact with what appears to be the ghost of Warren, while Jonathan is having a personal revelation that he misses high school and still cares for his old friends. After they dig up the artifact, Andrew, on Warren's instructions, insults and kills Jonathan, causing his blood to spill all over a 'door' in the dirt.\n\nIn the library, Willow is visited by the ghost of Cassie, a girl Buffy once helped, who claims to have been sent by the dead Tara. The ghost relays Tara's message that Willow will end up killing everyone if she ever uses magic again, and recommends suicide as a solution. This tips Willow off that she has not been talking to Cassie, and she demands to know who the being really is. The being reveals itself as The First and threatens Willow and all her friends before vanishing.\n\n\nThis episode was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\n\n"}

On 21 February 2012 Pamela, Neda and Nika decided to start solo careers and leave Feminnem and effectively disbanded the group.\n\nParmać was born 28 April 1985 in Split, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia and took dance lessons from an early age. At the age of thirteen she performed as member the band \"Kompas\". In 2004 she entered the Hrvatski Idol competition (the Croatian version of Pop Idol). Her self-confident approach and ability to improvise appealed to the audience, as best seen in her rendition of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\", when she continued to perform despite forgetting the lyrics. She finished third, with the show being won by Žanamari Lalić. Together with two other finalists, she went on to create Feminnem.\n\nAntolos was born 10 August 1989 in Rijeka, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia.\n\nRamljak was born 24 December 1979 in Čapljina, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia.

The organization promoted the founding of birth control clinics and encouraged women to control their own fertility. In 1942, the league became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nThe League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921, and incorporated under the laws of New York State on April 5, 1922. Birth Control Leagues had already been formed in a number of larger American cities between 1916 and 1919 due to Sanger's lecture tours and the publication of the Birth Control Review. By 1924, the American Birth Control League had 27,500 members, with ten branches maintained in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colorado, and British Columbia.\n\nIn June 1928, Margaret Sanger resigned as president of the American Birth Control League, founding the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control and splitting the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau from the League. In 1939 the two were reconciled and merged to form the Birth Control Federation of America. In 1942 the name was changed to Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nIts headquarters were located at 104 Fifth Avenue, New York City from 1921–30 and at various offices on Madison Avenue from 1931–39. It was not associated with the National Birth Control League, founded in 1915 by Mary Coffin Ware Dennett, or the later Voluntary Parenthood League.\n\nThe American Birth Control League was also instrumental in regards to African Americans and birth control.\n\nThe ABCL was founded on the following principles, here excerpted from Margaret Sanger's \"The Pivot of Civilization\":\nWe hold that children should be\n\n\nTherefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to prevent conception except when these conditions can be satisfied.\n\nAt its founding, the ABCL announced the following purposes:\n\nMargaret Sanger listed the following aims of the organization in the appendix of her book \"The Pivot of Civilization\":\n\nIn 1921, the ABCL organized the First American Birth Control Conference at New York City, November 11–18, 1921.

The ABCL arranged the holding of the Sixth International Birth Control Congress in the United States in 1925. The ABCL published leaflets, pamphlets, books, and a monthly missal named \"Birth Control Review\". Margaret Sanger served as the first president of the organization. Frances B. Ackerman served as the first Treasurer. Anne Kennedy was the Executive Treasurer. Lothrop Stoddard and C. C.

It is believed to have been composed shortly after 1170. \nOddr Snorrason made use of it in his \"Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar\", in a section known as \"Albani þáttr ok Sunnifu\" (\"tale of Alban and Sunniva\") and also as \"Seljumanna þáttr\". Oddr's original work was composed in Latin but only survives in an Old Icelandic translation. The legend was also included in the later compilation \"Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta\". The tale is directly based on that in \"Acta sanctorum in Selio\", and thus slightly younger, although likely still belonging to the 12th century.\n\nAccording to the legend, Sunniva was the heir of an Irish kingdom, but had to flee when an invading heathen king wanted to marry her.\nShe and her brother Alban (post-Reformation accounts add two sisters, called Borni and Marita) and their followers settle the previously uninhabited islands of Selja and Kinn in Norway during the rule of the pagan Jarl Hákon Sigurðarson (r. 962–995). \nTheir Norwegian neighbors on the mainland suspect the Christians of stealing sheep and complain to Jarl Hákon. Hákon arrives on Selja with a group of armed men, intending to kill the inhabitants. When the Christians realize what is happening they hide in caves on the island and pray to God to collapse the caves to spare them from being ravaged by Hákon and his men. The caves collapse and kill all the Irishmen.\nThe legend has two farmers, Tord Eigileivsson and Tord Jorunsson who anchored at Selja to spend the night on a journey to Trondheim, witnessing a supernatural light over the island and discovering a bleached skull with a sweet smell. Arriving in Trondheim, the two men tell their experience to Olaf Tryggvason and bishop Sigurd. After another account of similar events by a different witness, \nthe king and bishop travelled to Selja and found many sweet-smelling bones. They excavated the cave and recovered the body of Saint Sunniva incorrupt and looking as if the saint were asleep. The bones were collected and placed in a casket, and the body of Sunniva was placed in timber shrine.\n\nThe Benedictine Selje Abbey was built at the site around 1100 and dedicated to Saint Alban (the third-century British saint, who in medieval Scandinavian tradition became conflated with the 10th-century Irish saint at Selje); the local veneration of Sunniva can be traced to about that time, possibly influenced by that of Saint Ursula and the 11,000 virgins, but was at first subordinate to that of her brother. However, the original dedication to Alban at Selje may not have been to the British saint, but a German saint of the same name.\nRekdal (2004) draws further connections of the legend to early medieval Norse-Gaelic contact, especially to St. Donnan, whose legend gives an account of the saint and his brothers being killed by pagans on the island of Eigg in 617.\n\nSunniva's relics (allegedly again found incorrupt) were moved to the new cathedral in Bergen in 1170, and as a result, her veneration spread throughout Norway. During the fires in Bergen of 1170/71 and of 1198 the relics of Sunniva were taken from the cathedral and set down at Sandbru. This reportedly halted the advance of the fire and was hailed as a miracle. The shrine with her relics remained in Bergen's Christ Church until 1531, when the church was demolished in the turmoils of the Reformation, and the shrine was transferred to Munkeliv monastery. The shrine was lost when that monastery was destroyed in its turn in 1536.\n\nThe feast day of Alban and Sunniva and their companions, known as \"Seljumannamesse\", is 8 July. Sunniva also has a separate feast day commemorating her translation to Bergen in 1170, on either 31 August or 7 September.\n\nNorwegian author Sigrid Undset, who had converted to Roman Catholicism at age 42 in 1924, visited the remains of Selja monastery in 1926 and was inspired to write a novella based on the legend, completed by 1928, for which she commissioned fifteen watercolour illustrations by her friend Gøsta af Geijerstam. The book was first published in German in 1932. An edition with Undset's original Norwegian text appeared only in 2000.\n\nNumerous institutions in Norway are named for Sunniva, including the Catholic church in Molde, various schools—including St Sunniva School in Oslo—several Norwegian ships, the St. Sunniva dormitory in Bergen, and the Sunniva Centre for Palliative Care (\"Sunniva senter for lindrende behandling\") in Bergen. Selje introduced a municipal coat of arms depicting Sunniva in 1991.\n\nFor an exhibition dedicated to Sunniva in Bergen Museum, under the title of \"St. Sunniva and the holy shrine\" (\"Sankta Sunniva og det heilage skrinet\"), on 7 September 2011, a reconstruction of the shrine was made and transferred to the museum in a procession involving a reconstructed longboat, commemorating the historical translation of the saint's relics.\n\"Sunniva\" is in use as a feminine given name in Norway.\n\n\"Sunniva\" is the Latinized form from \"Acta sanctorum in Selio\". The Old Icelandic form is \"Sunnifa\" (manuscript spelling \"Sunniuæ\"). All are renditions of the Old English name \"Sunngifu\", \"Sunnigifu\", from \"sunne\", 'sun', and \"gifu\", 'gift'. The Old English name is on record in the Yorkshire Domesday Book, as \"Sonneuæ\".\n\nModern forms of the name include \"Synnøve\", \"Synøve\", \"Sønneva\", \"Sønneve\", \"Sunneva\", \"Synneva\", \"Synneve\", all given in Norway, but \"Synnøve\" being the most widespread (also adopted as \"Synnöve\" in Sweden), with 5021 Norwegian women called \"Synnøve\" recorded in 2015. The popularity of the name surged in the early 20th century, with a peak of close to 0.7% of given girls' names during the 1920s. Since the 1920s, its popularity has declined steadily, falling below 0.1% by the 2000s. The short form \"Synne\", however, has instead become the most popularly given form of this name; originating in the 1960s, it peaked in popularity in the late 1980s at 0.7% of girls' names, but since the 1990s has declined below 0.5%.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2272076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272076", "title": "Gold Coast Indy 300", "text": "Gold Coast Indy 300\n\nThe Gold Coast Indy 300 was an open-wheel motor race event that took place at the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia from 1991 to 2008. The challenging track, alongside a strip of beaches, had several fast sections and four chicanes. The event had various names during its history for sponsorship reasons; in its final year it was known as the Nikon Indy 300.\n\nThe race had been an annual event since 1991 originally as part of the CART IndyCar World Series, being the first race in the series to be held outside of the Americas, then following the split between CART and the newly formed Indy Racing League (IRL) in 1996 and the subsequent dissolution of CART in 2003, as part of the Champ Car World Series. Following the merger of the Indy Racing League and Champ Car World Series in February 2008 the future of the race had been secured until 2013 as an IRL IndyCar Series event; however the race was omitted from the 2009 IndyCar Series season calendar, and subsequently dropped by the IRL completely.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Gold Coast Indy 300 was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an \"event and festival\".\n\nThe event arrived in Australia on the back of lobbying from a consortium of businessmen from the state of Queensland. The event's early years were dogged by controversy as Australia's motor sport governing body, the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS), initially refused to sanction the event. The Queensland State Government had been largely supportive of the event, whereas support at local level from the Gold Coast City Council varied, and was occasionally openly hostile to the event. \n\nFrom 1991 to 1997, the Gold Coast Grand Prix was typically held in March, and several times served as the CART season opener. In 1996, the Australian Grand Prix (Melbourne) moved from the fall to the spring. It created an undesirable scheduling conflict which eventually saw the Gold Coast Indy move permanently to October, starting in 1998. By the late 1990s, as political tensions subsided, the race become a well-attended and popular event on the Gold Coast calendar with tens of thousands of spectators attending each of the four days of the event.\n\nThe 1993 race was particularly notable as 1992 Formula One champion Nigel Mansell's first race in American championship car racing, which he won in front of a large number of travelling British fans and media. It was also the first of a record seven race wins at the event for Newman/Haas Racing. In the 2002 event there was a frightening incident when a nine-car pile-up occurred at the start in very wet conditions, however no significant injuries were sustained. In 2003 a massive thunderstorm struck the area during the race, leading to a red flag and shortened race distance. \n\nThe event lost some of its lustre from 2004, as the split between American open wheel racing series started to draw teams from the Champ Car World Series across to the IRL IndyCar Series, whose calendar was considerably more domestic than the well-travelled Champ Car World Series. The falling popularity of open wheel racing in America further devalued the event, with NASCAR dominating the U.S. racing scene. The waning interest led to the V8 Supercars (the leading touring cars category in Australia and a support category since 1994) move from a non-championship to championship event in 2002 and take equal top billing with Champ Car, an unprecedented move across the Champ Car calendar. Traditionally the CART/Champ Car race was the final event of the programme, but in later years the final V8 Supercars race held this place.\n\nIn the first sixteen years of the event, there were sixteen different winners. In 2007 Sébastien Bourdais became the first driver to win the race twice, adding to his 2005 victory.\n\nOn 5 March 2008, it was announced that the IndyCar Series would travel to Australia for the first time, but due to contractual issues the race would not count towards the 2008 championship and would be a stand-alone demonstration event, in light of the recent merger between Champ Car and the IRL. Australian driver Ryan Briscoe nonetheless became the first local winner of the event, in what remains the final running of the event to date.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, after extensive negotiations with the IRL broke down, the Queensland Government reached a new five-year deal with A1 Grand Prix to stage a race at Surfers Paradise, severing its eighteen-year history with American open wheel racing. On 25 February 2009 it was announced that the event, which would combine one of the first few rounds of the 2009–10 A1 Grand Prix season and the 11th round of the 2009 V8 Supercar Championship Series, would be produced through a partnership between IMG and the Queensland Government. The event was also renamed as the SuperGP for 2009, with the iconic Indy name becoming obsolete.\n\nHowever, on 17 October 2009, A1GP Chairman Tony Teixeira announced that the United Kingdom operating arm of the series went into liquidation in June, with access to the A1GP cars and their ability to pay its suppliers having been impeded. That prevented the cars from leaving Europe in time to be on track in Surfers Paradise on 22 October. Therefore, A1GP withdrew from participation in the 2009 Nikon SuperGP, with V8 Supercars instead running additional races. A1GP refunded Gold Coast Motor Events Co. the sanction fee paid, and donated A$50,000 to a charity designated by the board.\n\nFollowing A1GP's withdrawal, V8 Supercars became the permanent and sole lead category of the event, which became known as the Gold Coast 600 as of 2010. This event continues to the current day, albeit on a shorter 2.96 km version of the original Surfers Paradise circuit. The original longer circuit has also now been rendered unusable by the light rail network, which now extends along Surfers Paradise Boulevard beyond the existing second chicane.\n\nIn June 2016 the Gold Coast Bulletin reported that \"secret government talks\" were underway to bring back the IndyCar race for 2017 or 2018, and that an area consortium had been given rights to negotiate with IndyCar for an Australian race with a preference for the Gold Coast. IndyCar management would not comment other than to say they were investigating potential overseas venues. With Supercars later signing an extension of their exclusive deal for the event from 2017 to 2019, combined with the prohibitive shorter track layout, and costs of bringing the series to Australia, there are several barriers preventing the revival of the event.\n\n\"Events which were not championship rounds are indicated by a pink background.\"\nNotes:\n\n\n\n"}

His parents were Beate Baumann (1774-1852) and Gottieb Wilhelm Hoffmann (1771-1846), chairman of the Unitas Fratrum congregation in Korntal.\n\nChristoph Hoffmann had a Pietist-Christian background and enjoyed a Christian education with the Brethren congregation in Korntal. As a young man he studied theology in Tübingen. An opponent of the much better known liberal theologian David Friedrich Strauss, Hoffmann was elected to the First National German Parliament, which met in Frankfurt am Main in 1848.\n\nThe failure of his efforts to create a better Christian State through politics caused him to return to the roots of Christianity as expressed by Jesus. He became convinced that Jesus had called for a radical change of attitude in people. The better state of being after such a change of attitude he saw as the Kingdom of God which was to be established. To this end he applied for the position of a missionary inspector with the Protestant St. Chrischona Pilgrim Mission of Basel in 1853, but left the position after two years.\n\nHoffmann dedicated his life to collecting people striving for such a \"kingdom\" and setting up communities in which their striving would express itself in daily life. Initially (1854) known as the \"Friends of Jerusalem\", the group in June 1861 formed itself into an independent Christian religious organisation known as \"Deutscher Tempel\", its members identified themselves as Templers. In 1868 the Templers started to create settlements in Palestine.\n\nThe Templers could buy in Jaffa some houses and land from failed colonists around George Adams, returning to the USA in 1869. On 5 March 1869 also Peter Martin Metzler, a missionary of St. Chrischona and personal acquaintance of Hoffmann from his times at the Pilgrims' Mission, sold his Jaffa-based mission station, including an infirmary and most of his real estate and other enterprises to the new colonists, before he left Jaffa.\n\nWhile the Lutheran Evangelical State Church in Württemberg condemned and fought the Templers as apostates, the Prussian position was somewhat milder. Their settlement in the Holy Land found a warm support through Wilhelm Hoffmann (*1806-1873*), who was no apostate from the official church, like his younger brother Christoph. Wilhelm Hoffmann served as one of the royal Prussian court preachers at the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church in Berlin and was a co-founder and first president of Jerusalem's Association (), a charitable organisation founded on 2 December 1852 to support Samuel Gobat's effort as bishop of the Anglo-Prussian Bishopric of Jerusalem. Between 1866 and 1869 Wilhelm Hoffmann dispatched his son Carl Hoffmann (1836-1903) as pastor of the German Protestant congregation of Jerusalem.\n\nHoffmann fell out with the Temple Society's co-leader Georg David Hardegg (*1812-1879*), so that in June 1874 the Temple denomination underwent a schism with Hardegg and about a third of the Templers seceding from the Temple Society and later mostly returning to an official German Protestant church body. Hoffmann died in the Templer settlement Rephaim near Jerusalem on 8 December 1885.\n\nHoffmann's literary output focusses on his vision of a New Jerusalem, a community based Kingdom of God that would eventually spread over all the nations:\n\nHoffmanns son Christoph (1847-1911) got leader of the Palestinensian templers in 1890, while from 1884 to 1890 \"Christoph Paulus\" was the leader.\n"}
{"id": "2272099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272099", "title": "British New Wave", "text": "British New Wave\n\nThe British New Wave is a style of films released in Great Britain between 1959 and 1963. The label is a translation of \"Nouvelle Vague\", the French term first applied to the films of François Truffaut, and Jean-Luc Godard among others.\n\nThe British New Wave was characterised by many of the same stylistic and thematic conventions as the French New Wave. Usually in black and white, these films had a spontaneous quality, often shot in a pseudo-documentary (or \"cinéma vérité\") style on real locations and with real people rather than extras, apparently capturing life as it happens.\n\nThere is considerable overlap between the New Wave and the \"angry young men\", those artists in British theatre and film such as playwright John Osborne and director Tony Richardson, who challenged the social \"status quo\". Their work drew attention to the reality of life for the working classes, especially in the North of England, often characterised as \"It's grim up north\". This particular type of drama, centred on class and the nitty-gritty of day-to-day life, was also known as kitchen sink realism.\n\nLike the French New Wave, where many of the filmmakers began as film critics and journalists, in Britain critical writing about the state of British cinema began in the 1950s and foreshadowed some of what was to come. Among this group of critic/documentary film makers was Lindsay Anderson who was a prominent critic writing for the influential \"Sequence\" magazine (1947–52), which he co-founded with Gavin Lambert and Karel Reisz (later a prominent director); writing for the British Film Institute's journal \"Sight and Sound\" and the left-wing political weekly the \"New Statesman\". In one of his early and most well-known polemical pieces, \"Stand Up, Stand Up\", he outlined his theories of what British cinema should become.\n\nFollowing a series of screenings which he organised at the National Film Theatre of independently produced short films including his own \"Every Day Except Christmas\" (about the Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market), Karel Reisz's \"Momma Don't Allow\" and others, he developed a philosophy of cinema which found expression in what became known as the Free Cinema Movement in Britain by the late 1950s. This was the belief that the cinema must break away from its class-bound attitudes and that the working classes ought to be seen on Britain's screens.\n\nAlong with Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson, and others he secured funding from a variety of sources (including Ford of Britain) and they each made a series of socially challenging short documentaries on a variety of subjects.\n\nThese films, made in the tradition of British documentaries in the 1930s by such men as John Grierson, foreshadowed much of the social realism of British cinema which emerged in the 1960s with Anderson's own film \"This Sporting Life\", Reisz's \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\", and Richardson's \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\".\n\nBy 1964, the cycle was essentially over. Tony Richardson's \"Tom Jones\", Richard Lester's \"A Hard Day's Night\" and the early James Bond films ushered in a new era for British cinema, now suddenly popular in the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2272102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272102", "title": "Protoplanetary nebula", "text": "Protoplanetary nebula\n\nA protoplanetary nebula or preplanetary nebula (PPN) is an astronomical object which is at the short-lived episode during a star's rapid evolution between the late asymptotic giant branch (LAGB) phase and the subsequent planetary nebula (PN) phase. A PPN emits strongly in infrared radiation, and is a kind of reflection nebula. It is the second-from-the-last high-luminosity evolution phase in the life cycle of intermediate-mass stars (1–8 ). \n\nThe name protoplanetary nebula is an unfortunate choice due to the possibility of confusion with the same term being sometimes employed when discussing the unrelated concept of protoplanetary disks. The name protoplanetary nebula is a consequence of the older term planetary nebula, which was chosen due to early astronomers looking through telescopes and finding a similarity in appearance of planetary nebula to the gas giants such as Neptune and Uranus. To avoid any possible confusion, suggests employing a new term preplanetary nebula which does not overlap with any other disciplines of astronomy. They are often referred to as post-AGB stars, although that category also includes stars that will never ionize their ejected matter.\n\nDuring the late asymptotic giant branch (LAGB) phase, when mass loss reduces the hydrogen envelope's mass to around 10  for a core mass of 0.60 , a star will begin to evolve towards the blue side of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. When the hydrogen envelope has been further reduced to around 10 , the envelope will have been so disrupted that it is believed further significant mass loss is not possible. At this point, the effective temperature of the star, \"T\", will be around 5,000 K and it is defined to be the end of the LAGB and the beginning of the PPN. \n\nDuring the ensuing protoplanetary nebula phase, the central star's effective temperature will continue rising as a result of the envelope's mass loss as a consequence of the hydrogen shell's burning. During this phase, the central star is still too cool to ionize the slow-moving circumstellar shell ejected during the preceding AGB phase. However, the star does appear to drive high-velocity, collimated winds which shape and shock this shell, and almost certainly entrain slow-moving AGB ejecta to produce a fast molecular wind. Observations and high-resolution imaging studies from 1998 to 2001, demonstrate that the rapidly evolving PPN phase ultimately shapes the morphology of the subsequent PN. At a point during or soon after the AGB envelope detachment, the envelope shape changes from roughly spherically symmetric to axially symmetric. The resultant morphologies are bipolar, knotty jets and Herbig–Haro-like \"bow shocks\". These shapes appear even in relatively \"young\" PPN. \n\nThe PPN phase continues until the central star reaches around 30,000 K and it is hot enough (producing enough ultraviolet radiation) to ionize the circumstellar nebula (ejected gases) and it becomes a kind of emission nebula called a PN. This transition must take place in less than around 10,000 years or else the density of the circumstellar envelope will fall below the PN formulation density threshold of around 100 per cm³ and no PN will result, such a case is sometimes referred to as a 'lazy planetary nebula'. \n\nIn 2001, Bujarrabal et al. found that the \"interacting stellar winds\" model of Kwok\net al. (1978) of radiatively-driven winds is insufficient to account for their CO observations of PPN fast winds which imply high momentum and energy inconsistent with that model. This has prompted theorists (Soker & Rappaport 2000; Frank & Blackmann 2004) to investigate whether an accretion disk scenario, similar to the model used to explain jets from active galactic nuclei and young stars, could account for both the point symmetry and the high degree of collimation seen in many PPN jets. In such a model, the accretion disk forms through binary interactions. Magneto-centrifugal launching from the disk surface is then a way to convert gravitational energy into the kinetic energy of a fast wind. If this model is correct and magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) do determine the energetics and collimation of PPN outflows, then they will also determine physics of the shocks in these flows, and this can be confirmed with high-resolution pictures of the emission regions that go with the shocks. \n\n\n"}

It was originally intended to air on March 18, 2003, a day before the \"Angel\" episode \"Orpheus\", but was postponed due to the start of the Iraq War. The gang investigates Spike's trigger; Principal Wood and Giles team up without Buffy.\n\nNew York, 1977: Spike is fighting Nikki Wood, a Slayer whom he kills, seen in the fifth season episode \"Fool for Love\", in a park at night in pouring rain while her son watches from his hiding place behind a bench. Spike has the opportunity to kill her but the kid distracts him and he lets her go with the promise that they'll meet again. \"Love the coat,\" he adds with a smile, before he leaves. When he's gone, a clearly troubled Nikki finds her son and calms his fears by telling him, \"The mission is what matters.\"\n\nThe scene switches to an alley in present-day Sunnydale. Buffy, Principal Robin Wood, and Spike are fighting a bunch of vampires. Buffy and Spike manage to kill their quarry, but a vampire has knocked Wood to the ground, and is about to kill him. Spike saves Wood by killing the vampire from behind, then helps him up. Wood thanks him, but the camera zooms in on the stake he's holding, and we see blood dripping.\n\nPreviously, the First Evil had programmed Spike with a post-hypnotic suggestion in his mind that allows it to turn Spike violent using an old song, \"Early One Morning\", as a trigger. This way the First was able to command him to kill again. Buffy wants to find out how to turn it off so that she can fully trust Spike against the First, but Giles opposes Buffy. In his opinion, Spike is dangerous and must be contained or disposed of.\n\nAt the same time, the Scoobies go to the basement of Buffy's house, where Willow makes a spell with the Prokaryote stone, a magical artifact that penetrates Spike's mind and makes him more conscious of how the trigger works. During this process information about Spike's human past is revealed, including how he turned his sick mother into a vampire only to be rejected by her newly vampiric self. The song that his mother used to sing makes him relive the whole episode and switch into his evil, soulless self. He unwittingly hurts Dawn in the process and scares them all, except Buffy. Meanwhile, Willow receives a phone call from a girl named Fred and quickly leaves for Los Angeles. She apologizes to Buffy for her quick departure, but promises to be back as soon as she can.\n\nAfter the previous incident, Wood privately convinces Giles that Spike must die. Giles learns that Wood is the son of Nikki, now dead, and that Spike killed her. The two plan for Giles to distract Buffy while Wood takes care of Spike.\n\nGiles takes Buffy on patrol and begins asking her indirect questions and making obscure references to her role against the First. In the meantime, Wood takes Spike to his hideout with the promise to protect him, but upon arrival Wood reveals to Spike that he knows Spike murdered his mother and that he's going to kill the monster inside him. Spike says he has no remorse over killing Wood's mother, and that it was \"all part of the game\". Wood then plays the song \"Early One Morning\", which triggers Spike's violent, monstrous self and the two fight. As the fight progresses, Spike continues to relive the events that transpired between him and his mother, due to the Prokaryote Stone. Wood takes advantage of Spike's flashbacks, and using weapons, knocks Spike around until he cannot stand and he then attempts to stake him.\n\nAt this point, Spike regains control of his own mind, having faced his own anger and regret on turning his mother into a vampire and then being forced to kill her. Wood is now almost helpless against the much stronger Spike, who gives him a violent beating and demonstrates that the song has no more power over him. Spike tells Wood that the difference between his mother and Spike's mother, is that Spike's mother actually loved him back.\n\nWhile Giles and Buffy are talking in the cemetery, they become involved in a fight with another vampire. Buffy realizes that Giles has been trying to distract her while Wood kills Spike. She kills the vampire, leaves Giles and rushes to Wood's place. Buffy finds Spike at Wood's place, with Wood badly hurt, but alive. Spike tells her that he gave Wood \"a pass\" because he killed Wood's mother, but if Wood tries anything again, he'll kill him. Buffy goes inside and tells Wood that she needs Spike alive, and that she has no time for personal vendettas. She promises him that if he tries anything like this again, she'll let Spike kill him. As she walks away, she says she has a mission to win this war - \"The mission is what matters\" - echoing Robin's mother's words when he was a child.\n\nOnce at home, Buffy tells Giles that his and Wood's plan failed, and shuts the door on him, saying \"I think you've taught me everything I need to know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the end of the war the family moved to Brooklyn and his father returned to work as a professor of psychiatry. His mother taught at a Hebrew school. \n\nScheinman first experience with robots was watching \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" around age 8 or 9. The movie frightened him and his father suggested building a wooden model as therapy. As a child and teenager Scheinman designed and constructed a voice-controlled typewriter; this Science Fair project both gave him entry into MIT as an undergraduate in engineering as well as providing a foundation for his later inventions. He was a graduate of the now-defunct New Lincoln High School in New York. In the late 1950s, and while in high school, Scheinman engineered a speech-to-text machine as a science fair project. \n\nScheinman attended MIT as an undergraduate, starting at age 16 and completed a degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1963. He was president of the Model Airplane Club and had a summer job at Sikorsky Aircraft. His Bachelor's thesis was on controlling the depth of a model hydrofoil wing in the MIT towing tank.\n\nAfter graduation, on the advice and recommendation of his advisor, Holt Ashley, he got a job Boeing, where he worked on a lunar gravity simulator. He left to travel the world for a while, and then enrolled at Stanford University's graduate program, initially in Aeronautics and Astronautics, switching later to Mechanical Engineering, while still taking courses in A&E. He complete his Masters degree in one year and stayed on to work on an engineer's degree. He had summer jobs working on the Apollo program, with project on the Command Module heat shield and the Saturn rocket turbopumps.\n\nScheinman was awarded a research assistantship at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, working for Bernard Roth on building hands and arm for computers. The lab had an electric prosthetic arm developed circa 1962 by Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, known as the Rancho arm, which they had interfaced to a computer. (The arm was originally designed to be controlled with buttons pressed by a user's tongue.) Scheinman was assigned to maintaining the arm but it proved hard to use, with poor accuracy and inverse kinematics that were difficult to compute. He became involved with new robot designs. One was the Orm arm, (Norwegian for \"snake\") which he built with Larry Leifer. It consisted of seven stacked plates, with each plate connected to the next by four small pneumatic actuators. Each actuator of which could be inflated or deflated by setting or resetting a bit in a computer word. That arm also proved difficult to control. \n\nHis next goal was a fast arm, which became the Stanford Hydraulic Arm. The hydraulic arm needed the full attention of the PDP-6 computer used to control it, which normally was time-shared, and the arm proved too powerful, with its motions shaking the computer room and requiring special isolation. Donald L. Pieper, in his 1968 PhD thesis lists its purpose as \"smashing things.\" Pieper thesis also recommended specific configurations of robot linkages that would allow easier arm solutions. \n\nIn 1969, Scheinman invented the Stanford arm, an all-electric, 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an arm solution in closed form. The three wrist axes intersect at a point, as prescribed by Pipers thesis. This allowed the robot to accurately follow arbitrary paths in space under computer control and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and arc welding. The robot also had brakes on each axis, allowing it to be controlled with time-shared computer. The design became his engineer's degree thesis.\n\nAfter completing his engineer's degree, Scheinman went to work for RacChem, designing automatic machines that would use RacChem's shrink plastic products. After about a year, Stanford asked him to come back as an employee of the AI lab and build the robot he had designed. He completed the first arm, the Gold arm, and was asked to build a second, the Blue arm, to allow experiments in arm coordination with vision. Other organizations wanted the arm, including SRI and Boston University, so Scheinman built kits for them that could be completed by a commercial machine shop.\n\nAround 1972, Scheinman was asked by MIT's Marvin Minsky to design a more compact arm. Minsky had funding from DARPA for a new robot and had visions of using it for remotely supervised surgery. Scheinman spent the summer at the MIT AI lab, designing a new arm that became the MIT Arm, completing the design back at Stanford. Like the Stanford arm, new arm featured a wrist with all axes intersecting, allowing a closed form arm solution, but now all the axes were revolute, unlike the Stanford arm which had a prismatic joint. The arm had a shell structure made of sheet metal, instead of beams, that contained all the wiring. It also used specially designed gear trains, in part to minimize backlash, and custom electric motors, rather than only off the shelf components.\n\nIn 1973, Scheinman started Vicarm Inc. to manufacture his robot arms, hiring Brian Carlisle and Bruce Shimano, who later helped found Adept Robotics. Vicarm got orders for copies of the Stanford arm and MIT arm from various research organizations, including universities, General Motors, the National Bureau of Standards, AT&T and the Naval Research Laboratory. The company soon offered a controller for the robots, using a Digital Equipment Corporation LSI-11, with 6502 microprocessors controlling the servos for each joint, including the end effector. They also developed a language, VAL, for controlling the robot. \n\nWhile studying at Stanford, Scheinman was awarded a fellowship sponsored by George Devol, the inventor of the Unimate, the first industrial robot. Scheinman traveled with Devol and Joe Engelberger to Unimation and several of its customers, observing robot applications, including loading and unloading machines, handling material and early attempts to do spot welding. These early robots were hydraulic and programmed by teaching the robot a series of individual points that the robot would repeat each cycle. Some path control could be achieve by teach many intermediated points, but true path following was not possible. \n\nThe Vicarm and its controller were small enough to be portable and Scheinman brought one to Unimation and set it up on Engelberger's desk, demonstrating the true path control that Unimation's robots could not achieve. He also brought an arm to an early robot trade show at the University of Illinois but was told it was a toy and could not be in the show, so he set it up on the front steps with an extension for power, attracting many researchers who understood its programmability advantage. Engelberger then invited him to bring the robot into his booth at the show. \nScheinman was then approached by General Motors (GM) who wanted a bigger version of his arm for a robotic assembly concept they were developing, but were concerned about his small company's ability to supply them, encouraging Scheinman to find a larger partner. In 1977, Scheinman sold his design to Unimation, who further developed it, with support from GM, as the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly (PUMA). He served for a couple of years as General Manager of Unimation's West Coast division. \n\nIn 1979, Scheinman was approached by Philippe Villers, then at Computervision, to join a new robotics and machine vision company he was forming a co-founder and vice-president. Automatix, which started operations in January 1980, was based in Massachusetts, but Scheinman ran its west coast office, where he developed RobotWorld, an automation system based on the concept that robots should operate in their own work space, where there would be no potential conflicts with humans. It consisted of cooperating small modules suspended from a 2-D linear motor that formed the roof of the workspace. The west coast office also supported other Automatix product development by designing components such as robot wrists. In the early 1990s, Automatix decided to stop selling robots because the application engineering required for each robot installation could exceed the cost of the robot itself by a factor of three or four and wasn't profitable. The RobotWorld product line was sold to Yaskawa, which offered them for biological lab automation and small part assembly. Scheinman worked for Yaskawa as a consultant for several years, and seven to eight hundred RobotWorld-based systems were sold.\n\nHis niece is jazz violinist Jenny Scheinman. He was married to Sandra Auerback in August 2006. His engineer son Dave Scheinman is head of hardware for 3D printing company Carbon_(company) \n\nVictor Scheinman died on September 20, 2016, in Petrolia, California at the age of 73. Up to the time of his death, Scheinman continued to consult and was a visiting professor at Stanford University in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.\n\nIn 1979, Scheinman and his Vicarm were featured in a \"Fortune Magazine\" cover story on robotics.\n\nScheinman received the Robotic Industries Association's Joseph F. Engelberger Robotics Award in 1986 and the ASME Leonardo Da Vinci Award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1990.\n\nOn April 19, 2002, General Motors' Controls, Robotics, and Welding (CRW) organization donated the original prototype Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly (PUMA) robot to the Smithsonian.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, broadcast of the American game-show Jeopardy!, Scheinman was the subject of the $1600 \"answer\" for the category \"Robotics\": \"In the 1970s Victor Scheinman developed the PUMA, or programmable universal manipulation THIS\" (question: \"what is THIS?\" — answer: \"arm\".).\n\n"}

Specifically, Millman's theorem is used to compute the voltage at the ends of a circuit made up of only branches in parallel.\n\nIt is named after Jacob Millman, who proved the theorem.\n\nLet e be the voltage generators. Let formula_1 be the resistances on the branches with voltage generators formula_2. Then Millman states that the voltage at the ends of the circuit is given by:\n\nThat is, the sum of the short circuit currents in branch divided by the sum of the conductances in each branch.\n\nIt can be proved by considering the circuit as a single supernode. Then, according to Ohm and Kirchhoff, the voltage between the ends of the circuit is equal to the total current entering the supernode divided by the total equivalent conductance of the supernode. The total current is the sum of the currents in each branch. The total equivalent conductance of the supernode is the sum of the conductance of each branch, since all the branches are in parallel.\n\nOne method of deriving Millman's theorem starts by converting all the branches to current sources (which can be done using Norton's theorem). A branch that is already a current source is simply not converted. In the expression above, this is equivalent to replacing the formula_4 term in the numerator of the expression above with the current of the current generator, where the kth branch is the branch with the current generator. The parallel conductance of the current source is added to the denominator as for the series conductance of the voltage sources. An ideal current source has zero conductance (infinite resistance) and so adds nothing to the denominator.\n\nIf one of the branches is an ideal voltage source, Millman's theorem cannot be used, but in this case the solution is trivial, the voltage at the output is forced to the voltage of the ideal voltage source. The theorem does not work with ideal voltage sources because such sources have zero resistance (infinite conductance) so the summation of both the numerator and denominator are infinite and the result is indeterminate.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1962 by Joseph F. Engelberger and George Devol and was located in Danbury, Connecticut. Devol had already applied for a patent an industrial robotic arm in 1954; was issued in 1961. \n\nDevol collaborated with Engelberger, who served as president of the company, to engineer and produce an industrial robot under the brand name Unimate. They introduced their new robot in 1961 at a trade show in Chicago.\nThe first Unimate prototypes were controlled by vacuum tubes used as digital switches though later versions used transistors. Further, parts available off-the-shelf in the late 1950s, such as digital encoders, were not adequate for the Unimate, so with Devol's guidance and a team of skilled engineers, Unimation designed and machined practically every part in the first Unimates. They also invented a variety of new technologies, including a unique rotating drum memory system with data parity controls.\n\nIn 1960, Devol personally sold the first Unimate robot, which was shipped in 1961 to General Motors. GM first used the machine for die casting handling and spot welding of car bodies. The first Unimate robot was installed at GM's Inland Fisher Guide Plant in Ewing Township, New Jersey in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die-casting machine and stack them. Soon companies such as Chrysler, Ford, and Fiat saw the necessity for large Unimate purchases.\n\nThe introduction of robotics to the manufacturing process effectively transformed the automotive industry, with Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company soon following General Motors' lead and installing Unimates in their manufacturing facilities. The rapid adoption of the technology also provided Unimation with a working business model: after selling the first Unimate at a $35,000 loss, as demand increased, the company was able to begin building the robotic arms for significantly less and thus began to turn a substantial profit. \n\nThe PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly\", or Programmable Universal Manipulation Arm\") was developed by Victor Scheinman at Unimation in 1978. Initially developed for General Motors, the PUMA was based on the earlier Vicarm design Scheinman invented while at Stanford University.\n\nUnimation produced PUMAs for years until being purchased by Westinghouse (ca. 1980), and later by Swiss company Stäubli (1988).\n"}

{"id": "2272257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272257", "title": "WBPX-TV", "text": "WBPX-TV\n\nWBPX-TV, virtual channel 68 (UHF digital channel 22), is an Ion Television owned-and-operated station licensed to Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications), as part of a duopoly with Woburn-licensed Ion Plus owned-and-operated station WDPX-TV (channel 58). The two stations share studios on Soldiers Field Road in Boston's Allston neighborhood and transmitter facilities on Parmenter Road in Hudson, Massachusetts.\n\nWPXG-TV (virtual channel 21, UHF digital channel 23) in Concord, New Hampshire, operates as a full-time satellite of WBPX; this station shares transmitter facilities with Lowell, Massachusetts-licensed Daystar owned-and-operated station WYDN (channel 48) on Fort Mountain near Epsom, New Hampshire. WPXG covers areas of southern New Hampshire, northeastern Massachusetts and southwestern Maine that receive a marginal to non-existent over-the-air signal from WBPX, although there is significant overlap between the two stations' contours otherwise. WPXG is a straight simulcast of WBPX; on-air references to WPXG are limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during programming. Aside from the transmitter, WPXG does not maintain any physical presence locally in Concord.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on January 3, 1979 as WQTV, under the ownership of Arlington Broadcasting. It carried programming from the Financial News Network, along with public domain movies and most network programs that were preempted by WBZ-TV (channel 4), WCVB-TV (channel 5) and to a lesser extent WNAC-TV (channel 7; later WNEV-TV; now WHDH). Channel 68 was the first UHF television station to employ what is known as \"circular polarization\" antenna transmission, which was intended to improve signal reception to inner city viewers, many of whom had difficulty receiving television reception due to surrounding tall structures. The station's transmitter, containing its \"helical\" broadcast antenna, was installed by helicopter in September 1978 on top of the Prudential Tower.\n\nWQTV began running a subscription television service in conjunction with Universal Subscription Television called BEST TV (\"BEST\" being an acronym for \"Broadcast Entertainment Subscription Television\"), based in Waltham. By the summer of 1979, the service's name was changed to Starcase, and by late 1981 it was renamed Star TV. Subscription television programming initially began after 7 p.m., with the service's programming gradually expanding to take up most of the broadcast day by 1980. Channel 68 was the answer for many viewers that wanted uncut movies but lived in areas that were not wired for cable television. The lure of uncut movies and late night adult entertainment created many electronic hobbyists eager to \"home-brew\" their own television descrambling devices.\n\nIn February 1983, Universal Subscription Television abruptly went out of business on WQTV due to a significant loss of paying subscribers to prevalent infringement of its subscription television signal. It was very easy to duplicate the signal due to its simplistic scrambling method, known as \"gated sync suppression,\" and its \"decoding key\" hidden in the audio channel subcarrier. This key was easily defeated with a decoder built around an FM stereo demodulator chip known as the LM1800. All of WQTV's subscribers were transitioned to another area subscription television service known as Preview, operated by Warner Communications' New England Subscription Television on Worcester's WSMW-TV (channel 27, now WUNI). WQTV flipped to a general entertainment format consisting of off-network drama series, old sitcoms, and movies. The station also continued to run most network shows that were preempted by WBZ-TV, WCVB-TV and WNEV-TV.\n\nIn 1984, WQTV overextended themselves by adding somewhat stronger programming to the station. These were mostly shows that previously aired on WSBK-TV (channel 38) or WLVI-TV (channel 56) to which those respective stations had lost the rights. Some of the shows run on WQTV included \"The Honeymooners\", \"The Munsters\", \"The Addams Family\", \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"Here's Lucy\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"Bonanza\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Partridge Family\", \"The Carol Burnett Show\", \"Star Trek\", \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", \"Sergeant Bilko\", \"Kojak\" and \"The Rockford Files\".\n\nIn the fall of 1985, WQTV dropped the rejected network programs and added more drama series to the lineup. The station began to aggressively market themselves at that point. But the station continued to lose money and experienced severe financial problems by November. Right after Christmas, the station laid off most of its staff and dropped all its cash programming. Arlington Broadcasting (which also owned WTTO in Birmingham, Alabama and WCGV-TV in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) placed the station up for sale and turned the dropped programming back over to the syndicators. A few shows such as \"The Honeymooners\", \"Mary Tyler Moore\", \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"Perry Mason\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" would move to other stations, while the rest of the shows simply no longer aired in the market. For a few days it was thought that WQTV would go dark, but the station was somehow able to remain on the air. Due to this uncertainty, \"TV Guide\" stopped including programming information for WQTV in its listings for several months. WQTV kept a couple of barter shows, public domain movies, and a few religious and minority-targeted shows. They also reinstated all the pre-empted network shows that had previously aired on the station.\n\nThe station was sold to \"The Christian Science Monitor\" during the summer of 1986, and in the fall, WQTV began broadcasting \"Monitor\" programming for thirty minutes a day. The following spring, WQTV brought back several previously aired syndicated programs that were not available in the Boston market such as \"Star Trek\", \"Carol Burnett\", and \"Rockford Files\", which aired during the 6 to 11 p.m. timeslots. The rejected network shows and public domain movies remained temporarily. That April, WQTV was relaunched as a family-oriented independent station. The station added a number of shows that other stations lost rights to such as \"Leave It To Beaver\", \"McHale's Navy\" and \"My Three Sons\". The station also bought back many of the shows it previously held the local rights during the period from 1983 to 1985. Other programming featured on the station included \"Captain Kangaroo\", \"Danger Mouse\" and \"Disney's Wonderful World\". The station also dropped the preempted network programs, which would move to WHLL (now WUNI). WQTV began to brand itself as \"The New QTV 68\", with an emphasis on family entertainment, billing itself as \"Boston's Fastest-Growing Television Station\". In addition, the station expanded the time allotted for the \"Monitor\" programs to two hours.\n\nIn the summer of 1989, WQTV condensed the entertainment programming into the late afternoon and evening hours, as the station began to focus on programs produced by the cable-exclusive (outside of Boston) Monitor Channel, which consisted of cultural, religious, news and information programs. By 1990, the station was down to a few hours of entertainment programs during the evening and overnight hours, and by 1992, the Monitor Channel was WQTV's only source of programming. However, the Monitor Channel shut down later that year after its transponder was sold to the parties behind USA Network to launch the Sci-Fi Channel, which left the station with reruns of the network's programming. In early 1993, the \"Monitor\" programs were finally dropped in favor of previously dropped off-network sitcoms and drama series that did not secure rights to air on other stations in the market.\n\nIn the fall of 1993, Boston University bought the station and for the third time relaunched it as a commercial general entertainment independent station, under the new call letters WABU. The station's schedule consisted of older cartoons, sitcoms and family dramas, though the retooled station briefly ran a few preempted CBS shows from WHDH-TV. A considerable amount of in-house local programming was added to the schedule during this time, especially during the primetime hours. BU managed to lure prominent local media personalities away from the major stations to host public affairs and news programs; among them were \"ECU with Gail Harris\", \"Business World with Jim Howell\", \"D.O.C.: Doctors On Call\" with Dr. Odysseus Argy, \"The Job Show\", \"Adler Online\" with Charles Adler, \"Consider This\" with Ted O'Brien and Delores Handy, and some children's programming on weekends (such as \"Lil' Iguana\" and \"The Story Shop\").\n\nMovies aired under the \"Cinema 68\" umbrella branding, at first airing in primetime after the aforementioned regularly scheduled local shows that aired in the 8 p.m. hour. By 1997, public affairs shows were moved to later weekday time slots, as well as during the day on weekends, with \"Cinema 68\" being moved up to 8 p.m. on weeknights. WABU was also the first Boston station to carry \"Judge Judy\" upon its September 1996 debut, where it aired in an hour-long block at 6 p.m. The station was outbid by Viacom the following year for future syndication rights, resulting in \"Judge Judy\" moving to Viacom-owned WSBK-TV in September 1997. From April to June 1999, which marked the last few months of BU's ownership, Dana Hersey arrived at WABU to host \"68 Film Loft\", a revival of the legendary \"Movie Loft\" which had been a staple of WSBK's prime time lineup for over two decades. The \"Movie Loft\" title could not be adopted since the rights to the name were still owned by, and eventually used again on, WSBK.\n\nWABU built a news department as soon as BU assumed station ownership. Beginning on February 14, 1994, the station broadcast two-minute news updates airing at the top of every hour between 11:58 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. known as \"Newsbreak 68\". Ted O'Brien and Delores Handy were the principal anchors, who always appeared separately, with other on-air staff appearing over time. Kristen Daly (later of WLVI's \"The Ten O'Clock News\") joined the anchor roster in 1998. Occasionally, meteorologists would provide in-depth weather forecasts, but general five-day forecasts were the norm. From 1996 to 1998, WABU was also the over-the-air flagship station of the Boston Red Sox, taking over from longtime Red Sox flagship station WSBK-TV. WFXT (channel 25) sports anchor Butch Stearns first surfaced as a part of Channel 68's Red Sox coverage before he joined the Fox station. All WABU news programming was cancelled in the summer of 1999, during the station's transition into becoming Pax TV affiliate WBPX.\n\nFrom the beginning, WABU was planning to extend the reach of its programming. On November 30, 1993, not long after BU acquired channel 68, the station announced that it was purchasing WNHT in Concord, New Hampshire, which returned to the air as WNBU on September 1, 1995. The station then purchased WCVX in Vineyard Haven in 1994 and relaunched the station as WZBU.\n\nIn 1999, Paxson Communications (the forerunner to Ion Media Networks) bought WABU and its satellites, immediately turning them into part-time affiliates of Pax TV (now Ion Television), while retaining some syndicated programs; the stations' call letters were also respectively changed to WBPX, WPXG and WDPX later that year. Eventually, the syndicated programs were dropped, turning WBPX and its satellites into full-time Pax owned-and-operated stations by 2000.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, the \"Boston Herald\" reported that NBCUniversal was considering acquiring WBPX to serve as the market's new NBC owned-and-operated station, after announcing in January that it was pulling the affiliation off of WHDH (channel 7). However, NBCUniversal instead purchased WBTS-LD (now WYCN-LD), which would become the network's new owned-and-operated station on January 1, 2017.\n\nIn the FCC's incentive auction, WDPX-TV sold its spectrum for $43,467,644 and indicated that it would enter into a post-auction channel sharing agreement. WDPX now channel-shares with former parent station WBPX-TV; as WBPX's signal does not reach Vineyard Haven, WDPX has changed its city of license to Woburn.\n\nThe stations' digital signals are multiplexed:\nWBPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 68, on April 16, 2009. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 32. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 68, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.\n\nWBPX's signal was previously relayed on translator stations WMPX-LP (channel 33) in Dennis and W40BO (channel 40) in Boston. On December 15, 2014, Ion reached a deal to donate WMPX-LP and W40BO to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar network.\n\n\n"}

She accepts the assistance of a stranger wearing a priest's collar and driving a truck and is horrified to discover that she has fallen into a trap. The man, who introduces himself as Caleb, terrifies her and burns his mark into her neck. He gives her a message for the Slayer (which the viewer does not hear at this time), stabs her in the stomach, and forces her out of the car. Minutes later, Faith and Willow find the girl on their way back to Sunnydale after re-ensouling Angel in Los Angeles and take her to the hospital.\n\nAt his apartment, Xander's erotic dream about the teenage Potentials is cut short when the girls wake him up to fix the toilet.\n\nAt the hospital, Faith asks Willow why the Scooby Gang failed to warn her about the threat of the Bringers. Faith subsequently encounters Spike chasing a young woman and mistakenly believes Spike is evil again. The young woman, now in her vampire form, attacks Faith, who (borrowing a stake from Buffy) quickly slays her.\n\nBack at the house, Faith encounters a cold reception from both Dawn and Giles, and Spike explains that the tension is not all because of her. Meanwhile, the First Evil reveals Buffy's form to Caleb who is residing in the basement of a winery.\n\nThe next day, Andrew tries to bring the interested Potentials up to speed on Faith's history. While they are quick to point out that Faith had killed a volcanologist, not a Vulcan, they watch Faith exercise in the back yard with fascination over this other Slayer.\n\nAt Sunnydale High School, Robin calls Buffy into his office where he fires her from her school job, emphasizing the need for her to focus on the mission.\n\nIn the Summers' home, Faith sneaks down into the basement to smoke a cigarette and have a moment away from the \"wanna-bes\" who, in her opinion, have way too much energy and are needy for more stories from her about her life. Spike sees her and also asks for a cigarette. She and Spike talk, and bond over their respective periods of being dangerous. Faith reveals they met once before years ago when Faith was in Buffy's body, and Spike reveals that he and Buffy had been more than just friends at one point. Buffy, having been fired by Principal Wood so she can focus more on the mission at hand, comes down and seems a bit unnerved at seeing the two of them so cozy. Dawn calls down that Willow has reported from the hospital: Shannon is awake. Buffy goes to the hospital, where Shannon tells Buffy of Caleb's message: he has something of Buffy's.\n\nLater at the house, Buffy tries to motivate the terrified Potentials to accompany her when she attacks Caleb (who, meanwhile, is re-enacting scenes of his past murders with the First Evil). Buffy alone is confident in her plan; Giles, Spike, her friends, and the Potentials all question her decision. Buffy and Faith, on a recon mission, follow a Bringer through the woods. They discuss Faith's intentions and her recent experiences with Angel before locating Caleb's stronghold in an old winery.\n\nAt the Summers' home, Xander directs the Potentials on the methods of attacking in battle. When Rona criticizes Buffy's intentions, Xander strongly defends his friend. Leaving Willow and Giles to stay behind to protect the more inexperienced girls, Buffy leads Spike, Faith, Xander, and the more experienced Potentials (including Kennedy, Molly, Rona, Chao-Ahn, Amanda, Diane, and several others) to the vineyard; they divide into two groups: an assault team and a back-up team. After an initial clash with the Bringers, Caleb appears. He has super-strength: he quickly knocks aside Buffy and Spike, and breaks Rona's arm. Xander and Faith arrive with the back-up team, but Faith is soon knocked unconscious. Caleb kills Diane and Molly, and Buffy orders a retreat after managing to knock Caleb down. Xander starts to yell that everyone needs to get out, but is then attacked himself by Caleb. Caleb says \"So, you're the one who sees everything? Let's see what we can do about that.\" He stabs his thumb into Xander's eye as Xander screams. Spike tackles Caleb, giving them enough time to get Xander and leave the vineyard.\n\nAlone and distraught, Buffy leaves the injured girls and walks through the empty streets as Caleb tells the First, in Buffy's form, that their victory is imminent.\n\n"}

He cofounded Kaspersky Lab in 1997 and helped identify instances of government-sponsored cyberwarfare as the head of research. He has been an advocate for an international treaty prohibiting cyberwarfare.\n\nKaspersky graduated from The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School in 1987 with a degree in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His interest in IT security began when his work computer was infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program to remove it. Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship. He became the CEO in 2007 and remains so as of 2020.\n\nKaspersky was born on 4 October 1965 in Novorossiysk, Soviet Union. He grew up near Moscow, where he moved at age nine. His father was an engineer and his mother a historical archivist. As a child he developed an early interest in math and technology. He spent his free time reading math books and won second place in a math competition at age 14. When he was fourteen, Kaspersky began attending A.N. Kolmogorov boarding school, which is run by Moscow University and specializes in math. He was also a member of the youth division of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the age of 16, Kaspersky entered a five-year program with The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, which prepared intelligence officers for the Russian military and KGB. He graduated in 1987 with a degree in mathematical engineering and computer technology. After graduating college, Kaspersky served the Soviet military intelligence service as a software engineer. He met his first wife Natalya Kaspersky at Severskoye, a KGB vacation resort, in 1987.\n\nKaspersky's interest in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, while working for the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.\n\nIn 1991, Kaspersky was granted an early release from his military service and left the defense ministry to take a job at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time. There, he and his colleagues improved the software and released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992. At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.\n\nIn 1994, Hamburg University in Germany gave Kaspersky's software first place in a competitive analysis of antivirus software. This led to more business for Kaspersky from European and American companies. Kaspersky Lab was founded three years later by Kaspersky, his wife and Kaspersky's friend. Natalya, who pushed Eugene to start the company, was the CEO, while Eugene was the head of research. The following year, the CIH virus (AKA the Chernobyl virus) created a boon for Kaspersky's anti-virus products, which Kaspersky said was the only software at the time that could cleanse the virus. According to \"Wired\", \"their software was advanced for the time.\" For example, it was the first software to monitor viruses in an isolated quarantine.\n\nKaspersky's company grew quickly in the late 1990s. From 1998 to 2000, its annual revenue grew 280 percent and by 2000 almost sixty percent of revenues were international. By 2000, it had a staff of 65 people, starting from 13 in 1997. The antivirus product was renamed to Kaspersky Antivirus in 2000, after an American company started using the product's original name, which wasn't trademarked.\n\nAs the head of research, Kaspersky authored papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments ideas on how to sabotage their political opponents. After the American film \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (AKA \"Die Hard 4.0\") (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which is believed to be the first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.\n\nKaspersky Lab developed a reputation for discovering cybersecurity threats. In 2015 Kaspersky and Kaspersky Lab discovered a group of hackers known as Carbanak that were stealing money from banks. They also exposed Equation Group, which developed advanced spyware for monitoring computer use and was believed to be affiliated with the National Security Agency in the U.S. According to \"The Economist,\" it was these discoveries, Kaspersky's \"relentless salesmanship\" and the company's anti-virus product that made Kaspersky Lab uncommon as an internationally recognized Russian company.\n\nKaspersky became CEO of Kaspersky Lab in 2007. According to a 2008 article in \"USA Today,\" he traveled to 20 to 30 countries per year promoting Kaspersky Lab products. In early 2009, \"CRN\" said his personality contributed to the company's growth from \"relative obscurity to now nipping at the heels of its larger, better-known rivals.\" At the time, Kaspersky Lab was the fourth largest endpoint security company. It introduced new products for the enterprise market and expanded its channel programs.\n\nIn 2011, Kaspersky made a decision against taking the company public, saying it would make decision-making slow and prevent long-term R&D investments. This led to a series of high-level departures from the company, including his ex-wife and co-founder. Another series of departures occurred in 2014 due to disagreements over how to run the company.\n\nKaspersky Lab has defended itself against allegedly frivolous patent claims more aggressively than most IT companies. In 2012, it was the only one of 35 firms named in a suit by patent troll Information Protection and Authentication (IPAC) to take the case to court, rather than pay a fee. The case was ruled in Kaspersky's favor. Also in 2012, another company, Lodsys, sued Kaspersky and 54 other companies for patent infringement, and that case also resulted in the claimant dropping the case against Kaspersky. According to an article in \"TechWorld,\" the company's aversion to settling these claims is most likely because Eugene \"just hates\" patent trolls. In his blog he called them \"parasites\" and \"IT racketeers.\"\n\nKaspersky himself is the co-author of several patents, including one for a constraint-and-attribute-based security system for controlling software component interaction.\n\nAs of 2015, Kaspersky Lab employed more than 2,800 people. As of 2012, Kaspersky was working on developing software to protect critical infrastructure, like power plants, from cyberwarfare.\n\nKaspersky is influential among politicians and security experts. He has warned about the possibility of cyberwarfare that targets critical infrastructure. He speaks at conferences advocating for an international cyberwarfare treaty, that would ban government-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\nAfter the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky proposed that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have some parts of the Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.\n\nKaspersky said anonymity on the Internet could be protected by using a proxy, whereby a responsible international body maintains a record of which online identities correspond to which real-world ones. For example, a person's identity would be revealed in cases of malicious activity. Some security experts believe that a centralized database of the real-world identities of Internet users would be \"a privacy disaster and a highly attractive target for thieves.\" \"The Age\" said it \"sounds a little too close for comfort to a Big Brother scenario\" and \"Wired\" said Kaspersky's views were highly aligned with the Russian government's agenda.\n\nMany organizations have been considering reducing privacy to improve security as a result of Kaspersky's arguments. In a more recent \"Slashdot\" interview Kaspersky said the Internet should be divided into three zones: a red zone for voting, online banking, and other \"critical transactions\" that would require an Internet ID; a grey zone that may require only verification of age to access the site, but not identity; and a green zone for blogs, news, and \"everything related to your freedom of speech.\" He proposes \"special proxies\" for red zone websites that allow disclosure of the user's identity only in the case of suspected malfeasance.\n\nKaspersky's prior work for the Russian military and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, allegations of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after he got his first clients in America. He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.\n\n\"Wired\" said Kaspersky's critics accuse him of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian telecommunications companies for example are required by federal law in Russia to cooperate with the government's military and spy operations if asked. Kaspersky said his company has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called the accusations \"cold war paranoia.\" According to \"Wired,\" Kaspersky staffers argue \"not unconvincingly\" that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with the Russian FSB, the KGB's successor, is limited. According to Gartner, \"There's no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state... but there is still a concern that you can’t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.” \"Computing\" mocked some of the more extreme accusations of espionage, but said it would be unlikely for a Russian business to grow to the size of Kaspersky Lab without relationships within the Russian government. NPR journalists also said it was unlikely Kaspersky was using its software for espionage, because it would be risky for the company's business, but said Kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in Russia-based cybercrime.\n\nIn August 2015, Bloomberg reported that Kaspersky Lab changed course in 2012. According to the publication, \"high-level managers have left or been fired, their jobs often filled by people with closer ties to Russia’s military or intelligence services. Some of these people actively aid criminal investigations by the FSB using data from some of the 400 million customers\". Bloomberg and \"The New York Times\" also said Kaspersky was less aggressive about identifying cyberattacks originating from Russia than from other countries, allegations Kaspersky refutes. For example, he allegedly ignored or downplayed a series of denial-of-service attacks in December 2011 that were made to disrupt online discussion criticizing Russian politicians. Kaspersky also allegedly ignored a Russian-based spyware called Sofacy, which is believed to have been used by Russia against NATO and Eastern Europe. On the other hand, Kaspersky also published information on the Russia-based Crouching Yeti cyberattacks two days before Bloomberg accused him of ignoring Russia-based cyberattacks. At the time, the company had published eleven reports on malicious Russian programs. Competitor FireEye said it is awkward even in the U.S. to investigate cybercrimes performed by one's own government.\n\nA March 2015 article in Bloomberg said an increasing number of executive staff at Kaspersky Lab previously worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies. According to \"News & Observer\", Kaspersky \"published a mammoth response, tearing down Bloomberg's accusations and accusing them of throwing facts out the window for the sake of a juicy anti-Russian narrative.\" Competitor FireEye said many U.S. IT companies also have executives that formerly worked for government military and intelligence agencies. NPR reported that Kaspersky has been doing an increasing amount of business with Russian cybersecurity agencies to catch cybercriminals. Kaspersky confirmed that Russian agencies are among its government customers.\n\nIn May 2017, the allegations resurfaced when US National Security Agency (NSA) director Mike Rogers told a US Senate Intelligence committee that the NSA was reviewing the US government's use of Kaspersky software for fear it would allow Russian intelligence services to conduct spy operations or launch cyber attacks against American digital infrastructure. \"ABC\" reported that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a secret report in February on possible connections between Kaspersky Lab and Russian intelligence, and that the FBI was currently investigating the matter. According to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director Vincent Stewart, his agency is \"tracking Kaspersky and their software.\" In a press release, Eugene Kaspersky denied that his software is currently, or could be, used for such purposes, stating that \"As a private company, Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyber-espionage efforts.\" He also stated that the US does not want to use his company's software for political reasons, and called the allegations \"unfounded conspiracy theories.\"\n\nKaspersky is one of many Russian \"oligarchs\" named in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nIn August 2015, two former Kaspersky employees alleged that the company introduced modified files into the VirusTotal community anti-virus database to trick its rivals' programs into triggering false positives. The result of the false positives was that important uninfected files would be disabled or deleted. The allegations also claimed that Kaspersky himself had ordered some of the actions, specifically targeting competitors, including Chinese companies he felt were copying his software. Emails dated 2009, two years after Kaspersky became CEO, were allegedly leaked to Reuters, one of which allegedly had Kaspersky threatening to go after competitors by \"rubbing them out in the outhouse,\" using a phrase popularized by Vladimir Putin. The company denied the allegations.\n\nKaspersky was ranked #1,567 on \"Forbes\" \"Billionaires List 2017\" with a net worth of US$1.3 billion (as of March 2017). He first made the list in 2015 when his net worth reached US$1 billion.\n\nKaspersky lives in Moscow, Russia with his wife and five children. He and his first wife were divorced in 1998. On 21 April 2011, his son, Ivan, then 20, was kidnapped for a $4.4 million ransom. Kaspersky worked with a friend at the FSB and Russian police to trace the ransomer's phone call. They set up a trap for the ransomers, where they rescued his son and arrested many of the kidnappers. The incident had an influence on Kaspersky's sense of personal security. He now travels with a bodyguard and security detail.\n\nKaspersky is one of the richest people in Russia. His net worth is about $1 billion. According to \"Wired,\" he has \"cultivated the image of a wild man with cash to burn.\" He has an interest in racing and drives his sports cars on race tracks as a hobby. He sponsors various \"quirky or scientific projects\" such as the Ferrari Formula One racing team or archaeological excavations in Akrotiri (prehistoric city). Kaspersky owns a BMW M3. Kaspersky describes himself as an \"adrenaline junkie.\" He has gone hiking on volcanoes in Russia and reserved a trip to space on the Virgin Galactic. He travels often and writes about his experiences in his personal blog. He also enjoys photography as a hobby.\n\nKaspersky is known for shunning formal attire, typically dressing in jeans and a shirt. He supports university projects and competitions in the IT security field.\n\n"}

It features over 10,000 animals of more than 850 species on more than 20 hectares. The internationally renowned zoo with an attached aquarium and invertebrate exhibit is active in preservational breeding of animals that are in danger of becoming extinct. In addition, in-the-wild conservation efforts and research focussing on animals of Madagascar, Wallacea, and Vietnam are actively promoted and supported via cooperation with Cologne University and local projects, such as in the case of Przewalski's horses.\n\nThe zoo was founded in 1860. The world wars led to a phase of stagnation, and the zoo had to close for two years entirely, after virtually being destroyed in World War II. It reopened in 1947; the aquarium was added in 1971. In 1985, the large primate house, one of the main attractions, was opened. Today, the zoo also features a free-flight rainforest hall with free-ranging birds and reptiles opened in 2000, a large elephant park, a house for hippos with great underwater views and, and as the latest addition, a farm with rare native species and petting zoo.\n\n\nMammals\n\nBirds\nNote that not all these species are present/on display at all times.

Less-endangered species may be kept to train for more endangered relatives.\n\nBirds\nMammals\n\nCologne Zoological Garden is one of the pioneers of international conservation efforts of zoos. Cologne Zoo manages on the one hand a number of projects on its own. On the other hand, the Zoological Garden of Cologne supports partner organisations for other projects with expertise and financial resources. The Zoo combines every new major construction project with a related natural conservation project in situ.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2018, Cologne Zoo was able to donate around 1,6 Mio. euro for wildlife conservation with grants for various projects. It also strongly promote wildlife conservation locally in the Rhineland area, cooperating with local organisations.\n\nAs a scientific zoo, Cologne Zoo fulfil numerous tasks. On the one hand, it is an attractive location that combines entertainment, fun, relaxation and education. And on the other hand, it is aware of the problems that wildlife face and have therefore become an important global player in nature and wildlife conservation initiatives in recent years. Cologne Zoo effectively coordinates its actions and initiatives through national associations such as the Association of Zoological Gardens (VdZ) and internationally active and networked organisations such as the European Zoo Association (EAZA) and the World Association of Zoos (WAZA).\n\nCologne Zoo's work focus on breeding endangered species under conditions appropriate to their species. As part of this, it coordinates breeding programmes and maintains breeding registers worldwide for numerous species. Nearly half of the species Cologne Zoo manages this way are listed as “endangered” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. The goal is to provide genetically variable and viable wildlife stocks and prepare animals for release into the wild if possible.\n\nThe zoo's engagement here has kept species such as the European bison, California condors, bali mynas, Przewalski's horses and sable antelopes from extinction. Cologne Zoo is also active in research and collaborates with the University of Cologne and other research institutions. Much of the knowledge about wildlife comes from research on such animals that are in human care.\n\nOn August 25, 2012, the Siberian Tiger Altai attacked his zookeeper and fatally injured her. The animal had entered through an open security lock into a covered part of his enclosure, which the zookeeper was cleaning. The cat was shot by director Theo Pagel with a rifle to allow rescue workers access to the carer.\n\n"}

The Sixth Form was part of the Stroud Post 16 Consortium which included Archway School and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College. It is situated in Downfield Lane, Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. The sixth form block underwent extensive building work to accommodate the ever-rising number of students and includes a new Lecture Theatre with state-of-the-art audio visual system.\n\nIn 1996, Marling School and its sister school Stroud High School, embarked on a process of collaboration at Sixth Form level, thereby enriching the curriculum and options available to students from both schools. From 2000-2010 the sixth form operated under the name Downfield Sixth Form before control of sixth form provision was regained by both schools.\n\nEntry requirements of 5 GCSE's at Grade B or above, including Maths and English, and similarly a grade B or above in subjects chosen to study at AS/A2 level.

{"id": "2272360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272360", "title": "Asterix and Cleopatra", "text": "Asterix and Cleopatra\n\nAsterix and Cleopatra is the sixth book in the Asterix album series by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. It was first published in serial form in \"Pilote\" magazine, issues 215–257, in 1963.\n\nThe book begins with an argument between Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, and Julius Caesar. As a triumphant invader, Caesar belittles the Egyptian people and suggests that Egypt, as a realm, is past its best. Infuriated, Cleopatra makes a wager with Caesar promising to build a new palace in Alexandria within three months. Cleopatra summons Edifis, who claims to be the best architect in Egypt. She promises Edifis that if he builds the palace on time he will be covered with gold; if he fails, he will be a meal for the sacred crocodiles.\n\nEdifis responds to this assignment by enlisting the help of the Gauls, Asterix, Obelix, Getafix, and Dogmatix. Thanks to Getafix and his magic potion, the work goes forward on schedule, despite multiple attempts by Edifis's arch rival, Artifis, to sabotage the construction after Edifis says he doesn't want his help, claiming Artifis works people too hard. Artifis tells the workers to demand less whipping, which would slow construction. However Getafix gives the workers magic potion. Artifis bribes the stone-delivery man to throw his load away, before Obelix beats him up, causing him to reveal the truth, a henchman tries to lock the Gauls inside a pyramid, but Dogmatix helps them find their way out. He subsequently tries to frame the Gauls by sending a poisoned cake to Cleopatra, but Getafix makes an antidote enabling the Gauls to eat it, then cures the taster and claims eating too much rich food was giving him a bad stomach. Edifis is kidnapped and hidden in a sarcophagus in the house of Artifis, but Obelix frees him. Artifis and his henchman are forced to work on the palace, but without magic potion.\n\nJust before the palace is due to be completed, Caesar intervenes by sending legions to try to arrest the Gauls, after he realises the three Gauls are in Egypt when a spy disguises himself as a worker, and sees the effects of the magic potion. The Gauls fight off the Roman soldiers, but the commanding officer proceeds to shell the building with his catapults. In desperation, Asterix and Dogmatix deliver the news to Cleopatra. A furious Cleopatra then hurries to the construction site to berate Caesar. Caesar's legions are ordered to fix the damage they caused (without any magic potion to help them) and the palace is successfully completed on time. Cleopatra wins her bet and covers Edifis with gold. Edifis and Artifis reconcile and agree to build pyramids together, and Cleopatra gives Getafix some papyrus manuscripts from the Library of Alexandria as a gift. The Gauls return, but Vitalstatistix criticises Obelix trying to give an Egyptian style point to menhirs.\n\n\"Asterix and Cleopatra\" has been adapted for film twice: first as an animated 1968 film entitled \"Asterix and Cleopatra\", and then as a live-action 2002 film called \"\".\n\nAn audiobook of \"Asterix and Cleopatra\" adapted by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on Hodder and Stoughton's \"Hodder Children's Audio\".\n\nIn most \"Asterix\" books, Obelix is not permitted to drink the Magic Potion, because he fell into a cauldron of Magic Potion in his childhood, resulting in a permanent effect, and Getafix fears that giving Obelix any more potion would have an unpredictable effect on him. However, in this book Getafix makes an exception due to an extraordinary requirement (the need to force open a solid stone door inside a pyramid which apparently, even Obelix's regular level of strength is incapable of doing). Obelix notices no difference, but keeps asking for more potion in subsequent volumes.\n\nObelix's dog, Dogmatix, is named for the first time in this story. It is also the first story in which Dogmatix takes a significant role (rescuing the heroes from a maze inside a Pyramid).\n\nThe recurring pirate characters appear in this book, though on this occasion they sink their own ship rather than endure a fight with the Gauls. The captain's son Erix (seen in the previous book \"Asterix and the Banquet\") is mentioned as having been left as a deposit to pay for the short-lived ship. After he and his crew have been forced to take jobs as galley slaves on Cleopatra's barge, the captain expresses the unusual determination to wreak revenge on the Gauls — in other books, he simply wishes never to encounter them again.\n\n\nOn Goodreads, it had a score of 4.29 out of 5.\n\n"}

From 1989 to 1990, he served as the last President of Poland in exile. He succeeded Kazimierz Sabbat, and resigned his post following Poland's regaining independence from the Soviet sphere of influence and the election of Lech Wałęsa as the first democratically elected President of Poland since before the Second World War. \n\nRyszard Kaczorowski was born on 26 November 1919, in Piaski District , Białystok, Poland. His parents were Wacław Kaczorowski, of Jelita and Jadwiga (née Sawicka). In 1920, when Białystok was overrun by Soviet forces during the Polish-Soviet War, it briefly served as headquarters of the Polish Revolutionary Committee headed by Julian Marchlewski, which attempted to declare the Polish Soviet Socialist Republic. \nThe city again changed hands after the Battle of Białystok, when the city was liberated by the 1st Legions Infantry Division and 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment. The family witnessed certain dramatic results of the battle from a small wooden house typical at Argentyńska Street.\n\nHe completed his education at a school of commerce. He was also a Scouting instructor of a local branch of the Polish Scouting Association. Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, he secretly recreated the scouting movement – which was banned by the Soviet authorities – and became a head of the Białystok banner of the Szare Szeregi. In 1940, he was arrested by the NKVD and sentenced to death, which was later changed to ten years in a concentration camp in Kolyma. He remembered later:On the third of May we organized a bonfire in the cell. And since we were on death row, we could not be punished any more, so the guard who opened the window and shouted \"quieter!\" he hit a clay bowl we had on hand. The bowl splattered, the guard hid, and we sang so that I think the whole prison heard.\n\nFollowing the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement of 1941, he was set free and enlisted in Anders' Army. After its evacuation from the Soviet Union, Kaczorowski joined the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division, where he completed divisional secondary school. He fought in most major battles of the Polish 2nd Corps, including the Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war, he remained in the United Kingdom as a political emigrant. Following demobilisation, he completed an academic course in foreign trade at the Regent Polytechnic. Until 1986, he worked in business as an accountant. From 1955-67, he was the Chief Scout, and, subsequently, President of the émigré Polish Scouting Union (ZHP). As such, he presided the Polish delegation for the 1957 Jamboree.\n\nKaczorowski was also active in Polish political circles and a member of the National Council of Poland, a parliament-in-exile. In 1986, he was appointed the Minister for Home Affairs within the Polish government in exile. As the April Constitution of Poland of 1935 (the legal basis for the government) allowed the president to appoint his successor \"in case the seat is emptied before the peace is settled\", acting president in exile Kazimierz Sabbat named Kaczorowski as his successor in January 1988. Sabbat died suddenly on 19 July 1989 and Kaczorowski automatically succeeded him. He handed over the insignia of the presidential power of the Second Republic to President Lech Wałęsa on 22 December 1990, signifying both a recognition of the legitimacy of the government in exile and its continuity with the Third Polish Republic.\n\nRyszard Kaczorowski's last home was in London. He had two daughters with wife Karolina, Jadwiga Kaczorowska, who has two children Zenek and Wanda Szulc, and Alicja Jankowska who has three children, Ryszard, Marcin and Krystyna Jankowska. He was frequently present in Poland and was treated according to the Polish law on former presidents of the state, granting him a presidential pension, Biuro Ochrony Rządu protection and a chancellery. He was an honorary chairman of numerous social and historical organisations, as well as an honorary citizen of almost thirty cities in Poland, including: Warsaw, Gdańsk, Gdynia, Kielce, Kraków, Opole, Zielona Góra and his hometown of Białystok.\n\nDuring his retirement, Kaczorowski did not hold any public positions, although it was reported that in November 1994 Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak proposed to President Wałęsa to appoint Kaczorowski as Minister of Defence (as, under the then-constitution, the President appointed the Ministers of Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs, regardless of the Prime Minister's will). Although he was a self-described follower of Józef Piłsudski (\"Piłsudczyk\"), Kaczorowski chose to not get involved in any partisan or strictly political activity during his retirement.\n\nOn 9 November 2004, Kaczorowski was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as an Honorary Knight Grand Cross by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom for \"his exceptional contribution to the community of Polish emigrees and their descendants living in the UK\".\n\nHe died on 10 April 2010 in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia, along with the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński and 94 others. He was the oldest victim of the crash. On 19 April 2010, Kaczorowski's coffin was taken to St John's Cathedral for a funeral mass, before being buried in a crypt at the National Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw.\n\n\n"}

Along with four other models (Tylene Buck, Kim Kanner (Shakira), Midajah and Pamela Paulshock), she accompanied members of the nWo to ringside for their matches.\n\nHunter trained to become a professional wrestler with Killer Kowalski in Boston. She was the only female in the class and soon began working on the independent circuit and overseas. Hunter formed a tag team with fellow Kowalski graduate Nikki Roxx in World Xtreme Wrestling known as The Killer Babes. She then worked as the manager for Slyck Wagner Brown. Together they held both Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling's 3PW Tag Team Championship and Jersey All Pro Wrestling's JAPW Tag Team Championship. April was the first female in pro wrestling history to hold the (male) tag team title.\n\nShe traveled to Canada for the first time in December 2005, working for Action Wrestling Entertainment and wrestling against Sarah Stock.

In filmmaking, a location is any place where a film crew will be filming actors \"and\" recording their dialog. A location where dialog is not recorded may be considered a second unit photography site. Filmmakers often choose to shoot on location because they believe that greater realism can be achieved in a \"real\" place; however, location shooting is often motivated by the film's budget.

He studied under Francis Chantrey and Edward Hodges Baily, and then, in 1836 went to Rome to pursue his study of classical sculpture, staying for two years.\n\nIn 1844, he participated in an exhibition held at Westminster Hall to select artists to decorate the rebuilt Palace of Westminster. \nIt proved to be the turning point of his career, leading to many commissions for public monuments not only for the new Houses of Parliament - for which he made statues of the Lord Chancellors Clarendon and Somers, and of Chaucer but also for Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral. He made the colossal bronze of Robert Peel for Manchester; with figures representing the city, illustrative of manufactures and commerce, and another, symbolising the arts and sciences, at the base of the pedestal.\n\nHis monument to Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination was set up in the south-west corner of Trafalgar Square in 1858 and inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. The statue, which depicted Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862.\n\nIn June 1864, Calder Marshall was commissioned to make an allegorical group representing \"Agriculture\", one of the four representing various \"skills\" to be installed on the Albert Memorial. A model was completed within two months. His ideas - unlike those of the other sculptors working on the groups - received a generally positive reception from the Executive Committee overseeing the monument, and the sculpture was completed by April 1868. It shows a female personification of Agriculture, directing the attention of farmers to the benefits of modern technology, symbolised by a steam cylinder and cog, and a retort.\n\nCalder Marshall was the most prolific exhibitor of statuary at the Royal Academy in the Victorian age.\n\nA number of his works were reproduced - often in reduced sizes - in Parian Ware porcelain by Copeland, one representing \"Sabrina\" proving especially popular.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2272393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272393", "title": "Chip Hilton", "text": "Chip Hilton\n\nWilliam \"Chip\" Hilton is the central character in a series of 24 sports novels for adolescent boys written by the successful college basketball coach and 1968 Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Clair Bee (1896–1983). In addition to Bee's authorship of the Chip Hilton series, he was also the author of several basketball and coaching technique books. The Chip Hilton series was published between 1948 and 1966 by Grosset & Dunlap, with Bee's last manuscript, \"Fiery Fullback,\" published in 2002.\n\nThe series hero excels in football, basketball and baseball, and is often placed in the position of persuading his less-than-perfect teammates to play his way and share his values—with winning championships being the result. Stories have two or three subplots, sometimes unrelated to sports, and one title is distinguished for tackling racism. The Chip Hilton books sold 2.2 million copies, and, in 1997, the NCAA founded the Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the series was re-issued by a Nashville religious book publishing house with the co-operation of Bee's children. The original series is highly collectible, with some titles being worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nUnlike other Grosset & Dunlap boys series books of the period, the Chip Hilton stories are distinguished by a greater degree of psychological interest. The staidly perfect Chip serves as a foil for his much more human fellow characters. Chip Hilton excels at all major sports, except hockey and soccer. Like most series books heroes, he does have a love interest, but spends much of his time with his buddies: \"Biggie,\" \"Soapy,\" \"Speed\" and \"Fireball\" in pursuit of sports. His occasional girl friend is Mitzi, the head cashier at his employer's drug store, about whom he once daydreamed while looking in a storefront at a display for dancing lessons. Chip was based on Seton Hall basketball player Bob Davies, and Chip's coach, Henry \"The Rock\" Rockwell, was based on Bee himself.\n\nChip Hilton books are always about football, basketball, or baseball. The most notable book in the series is \"Hoop Crazy,\" which examines the difficulties facing a black player wanting to join the basketball team. This is the only Chip Hilton book addressing social issues, and it does so in a compelling manner, although some of the early works did mention a great \"negro\" athlete, Miner, who played for one of the Big Reds' major rivals, Steeltown. Miner was presented as a gifted athlete without controversy over his participation; portraying an African-American athlete as accepted by teammate and foe alike. The reference is all the more interesting considering that the first books were written in the late 40s and early 50s when many pro teams, and even leagues, were yet to feature a black athlete. \"Tournament Crisis\" dealt with a team member who was Chinese and struggled to be included as a part of the team. He is initially depicted as angry and hard to like, and Chip works to help him and bring him around.\n\nIn the 1960s, interest in the Chip Hilton books waned because of (according to Bee) rising book prices and the influence of television. As a result, Bee never submitted his last manuscript, \"Fiery Fullback\", to Grosset & Dunlap. After Bee's death in 1983, his children sought a publisher for the manuscript, but found that many believed Chip too \"white-bread,\" and out of touch with contemporary readers. Suggestions to update the hero by giving him an earring and turning his baseball cap backward were nixed by Bee's children. At last, Broadman & Holman, a Nashville religious book publishing house, found Chip's old-fashioned values attractive and agreed to publish the manuscript while resurrecting the entire series. All 23 titles began appearing in paperback editions in 1998 as updated by Bee's children, and a special hardcover edition of Bee's final manuscript was published in 2002 without change from the original.\n\nSome critics and purists charged the publisher with literary tampering and an excess of political correctness, however only minor details were changed—not plot or basis for characters. Social themes and sports strategy were updated. Chip had a cat, read \"Sports Illustrated\", watched ESPN, and used a computer to do his homework. His best friend was now an African American; Asian and Hispanic character names were introduced. The publisher also wanted some religious content so Chip attended church regularly and prayed.\n\nThe original series of 23 Chip Hilton books has become a popular collectible, with the last few books fetching the highest prices because of their relatively limited print runs. The first six Chip Hilton titles were originally issued in fire-engine red, smooth textured bindings, with blank outer covers and full color picture dust jackets. These first six titles were later re-issued with blank rougher tweed cover bindings and picture dust jackets, as were the first editions of issues #7 through #19. There is an \"urban legend\" circulating that volume #7 was also originally issued in a fire-engine red binding, but this is unverified.\n\nAll 23 original titles were then re-issued in picture cover versions (later than the stated publication dates for issues #1-#19), without dust jackets, using the original dust jacket illustrations for the picture cover illustrations, with some variations existing for many issues with regard to some of the back cover images and back cover book title listings.\n\nThere is an active market in the original Chip Hilton hardback books on the eBay auction site, with usually 60-70 copies or partial sets for sale at any one time, with prices ranging from as low as $1–$2 for rough condition copies of the more common copies of tweed binding edition books without dust jackets up to several hundred dollars or more for fine condition copies of \"Hungry Hurler\" (#23), of which apparently only about 12,000 copies were printed.\n\nIn the new paperbacks, the first printing of the first 12 books carry a holographic image of a Chip Hilton logo.\n\nSince 1997, the NCAA has presented The Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award to a Division I men's basketball player who has demonstrated outstanding character, leadership, integrity, humility, sportsmanship and talent both on and off the court, similar to the fictional Chip Hilton character.\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Derry, New Hampshire-licensed Justice Network affiliate WWJE-DT (channel 50); Entravision Communications, which owns Worcester, Massachusetts-licensed UniMás affiliate WUTF-TV (channel 27), operates WUNI under a joint sales agreement (JSA). WUNI and WWJE share studios and transmitter facilities on Parmenter Road in Hudson; under the JSA, master control and some internal operations of WUNI are based at WUTF's studios on 4th Avenue in Needham.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on January 1, 1970 as WSMW-TV, an independent station that featured English-language general entertainment programs including old movies (including the entire series of Abbott and Costello movies and the Bowery Boys/Dead-End Kids movies starring Huntz Hall), cartoons, religious shows (including the Jacob Brothers and \"The PTL Club\"), a cooking show (\"Cooking with Bernard\"), science fiction shows (such as Gerry Anderson's \"UFO\"), dramas (including \"Maverick\" and \"Thriller\"), as well as sitcoms (including \"The Phil Silvers Show\" and \"Petticoat Junction\"). Though WSMW-TV was within the Boston market, it was far enough from Boston itself that the station was able to air some of the same shows as the Boston stations, in a similar situation to WMUR-TV (channel 9), the ABC affiliate in Manchester, New Hampshire. The station's call letters stood for State Mutual (Insurance Co.) in Worcester, the corporate owner of the station.\nWSMW also broadcast sports programs; from its debut through the end of the 1971–72 NBA season, the station was the television home of the Boston Celtics. In 1970 and 1971, WSMW broadcast (same-weekend tape-delayed coverage of) New England Patriots preseason games. WSMW also offered extensive coverage of college basketball throughout the 1970s, mostly games of the College of the Holy Cross and Assumption College, with some Boston College, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Bentley College games included on the schedule. The broadcast team of play-by-play man Bob Fouracre and analyst Bob Cousy worked these games. During the college football season, the station carried a taped two-hour broadcast of a game from earlier in the day on Saturday nights at 10:30 p.m. These games were typically Holy Cross home games, and when Holy Cross was on the road, games from UMass. Fouracre worked these games, and the analyst most of the time was Gino Cappelletti. WSMW also broadcast \"Bay State Bowling\", a weekly candlepin bowling program on Sunday evenings for most of the 1970s, which was hosted by Fouracre.\n\nIn 1970, shortly after the cancellation of the long-running \"Bozo's Circus\" on WHDH-TV, WSMW-TV debuted their own version of the Bozo the Clown series franchise, \"Bozo's Big Top\". Tom Matzell played Bozo, alongside Gene Sanocki as Bozo's sidekick Professor Tweetyfoofer. Local children were featured on the program daily, with many waiting up to one year or more for their chance to be on the show. This version aired until 1974.\n\nIn the fall of 1980, channel 27 began running the subscription television service Preview at night after 7 p.m. Early in 1983, the station dropped all of its entertainment programs and began running Preview 21 hours a day, with the remaining hours (in the morning) devoted to religious and public affairs programming. In the spring of 1985, WSMW cut Preview's broadcast hours down to 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. on weekdays and after 3 p.m. on weekends; it also brought back some general entertainment programs. Hill Broadcasting bought the station in late 1985, and changed the station's call letters to WHLL. At that time, WHLL dropped Preview and reverted to being a general-entertainment independent full-time.\nInitially, WHLL's schedule consisted of B-grade movies, drama series, public domain cartoons and a few sitcoms, as well as religious programs. While the station again initially shared some of its programming with Boston stations, by the fall of 1986 the duplication had largely been eliminated, and WHLL began to market itself as a Boston station. When cartoons and sitcoms were gone around 1987, the station began running preempted network programming from NBC, ABC, and CBS (that were declined by WBZ-TV channel 4; WCVB-TV channel 5; and WNEV-TV channel 7, now WHDH), which had previously aired on Boston's WQTV (channel 68, now WBPX-TV) and started airing BBC and Nine Network shows as well as airing new cartoons. The graphics were made by Cranston/Csuri and Pacific Data Images in 1989, which was less expense than BBC has. WHLL also began running some first-run syndicated shows by 1988, as well as a good amount of religious programming. During the station's tenure as WHLL, it employed WMJX radio personality David Allan Boucher as its booth announcer.\n\nIn 1992, the station added Spanish-language programming as a part-time affiliate of Telemundo, with the network's programming running from 4 or 5 p.m. until about 1 a.m. By 1993, when the Jasas Corporation acquired the Hill Broadcasting stations, WHLL ran Spanish-language programs after noon; much of the remaining English-language programming consisted of preempted network shows and religious programs. That year, the station became an Univision affiliate and changed its call letters to WUNI. In 1995, the station began carrying Spanish language programming full-time. The station was purchased by Entravision Communications in 2000.\n\nOn February 18, 2011, Rhode Island cable provider Full Channel TV, Inc. dropped WUNI from its systems and replaced the station with Univision's national feed on its digital cable tier; the impetus for the removal was a breakdown in negotiations over claims that Entravision demanded \"a 33% increase in retransmission fees\" as a cash payment to renew its carriage deal with WUNI.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, as part of a channel swap made by Entravision Communications, WUNI and sister station WUTF swapped channel numbers, with WUNI moving to digital channel 27 and virtual channel 66.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWUNI shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 27, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 29. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 27.\n\nThe WUNI-TV tower is a former television broadcast tower located in Boylston, Massachusetts. It is the tallest broadcast tower in Massachusetts, standing above ground level, and above mean sea level. The tower is owned by Entravision Communications and formerly broadcast WUNI until its move to Hudson.\n\nWUNI presently broadcasts 2½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with a half-hour each on weekdays; the station does not produce a late evening newscast on any night nor any news programs on Saturdays and Sundays). As WSMW, the station produced a nightly 6 p.m. newscast. This program was anchored by Doug White; Walter Cryan of WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island liked White's work on the newscast and hired him away from WSMW-TV; White subsequently became a longtime news anchor at another Providence station, WJAR.\n\nOn April 1, 2003, WUNI launched a half-hour local newscast, \"Noticias Univision Nueva Inglaterra\" (\"Univision News New England\"), at 6 p.m. Sara Suarez was brought from Univision's Denver owned-and-operated station KCEC to serve as anchor and news director. Angel Salcedo, who hosted WUNI's public affairs program \"Enfoque Latino\" for several years, was chosen as Suarez's co-anchor. However, Salcedo left the station shortly afterwards, leaving Suarez as the sole anchor until Carlos Ruben Zapata was hired as Salcedo's replacement. In 2005, Zapata left the station and eventually hired Eduardo Guerrero as co-anchor late that year. Before the newscast debuted, the station signed a news share agreement with New England Cable News, in which the regional cable news channel provided news footage. In addition, several commercial spots for NECN aired on WUNI and Telefutura-affiliated sister station WUTF-TV (which Univision owns, but is operated by Entravision), targeted at both stations' Hispanic audience.\n\nThe agreement with NECN expired in mid-2005, WUNI then signed a content sharing agreement with CBS owned-and-operated station WBZ-TV (channel 4). WBZ is acknowledged with an on-air credit when news footage supplied by the station appears on WUNI's newscasts, as well as at the end of the broadcast, before the copyright tag.\n\nIn April 2007, WUNI began producing news updates under the title \"Despierta Boston\" (which was anchored by Maria Gonzalez), during Univision's morning news/talk program \"Despierta América\" at :25 minutes past the hour from 7 to 9 a.m. The station used a modified version of the \"Despierta America\" logo branding, while using an alteration of the graphics and music package used on the 6 p.m. newscast. While \"Despierta Boston\" was relatively successful, economic problems led to Entravision discontinuing the morning updates in early 2009. The station also laid off Eduardo Guerrero (once again resulting in Sara Suarez anchoring solo) and 10-year veteran sports journalist Omar Cabrera.\n\nOn July 14, 2007, the station began airing the weekend edition of Univision-owned San Juan, Puerto Rico station WLII's newscast \"Las Noticias Univision\"; this was subsequently dropped.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the final film for Donald O'Connor, Gloria DeHaven, and Edward Mulhare; Mulhare died on May 24, 1997, almost six weeks before the film's release.\n\n\"Out to Sea\" was directed by Martha Coolidge, with a screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs. The original music score was composed by Michael Muhlfriedel and David Newman.\n\nCompulsive gambler Charlie Gordon cons his brother-in-law, widower Herb Sullivan, whose wife Susie was Charlie's sister, into an all expenses-paid luxury Holland America Mexican cruise. The catch, which Charlie does not reveal to Herb until the ship has left port, is that they are required to work as dance hosts. They must sleep in a cramped cabin in the bowels of the ship, and if they do not dance, they will get fired and have to pay nearly $3,000 (later Herb finds out it's really over $5,000) for the cruise or get thrown off the ship.\n\nRuled over by tyrannical, control-freak cruise director Gil Godwyn (\"a song and dance man raised on a military base\"), they do their best, despite Charlie's not actually being able to dance. Each meets a lady of interest. One is the luscious heiress Liz LaBreche, whose wealth attracts Charlie every bit as much as the rest of her does even though her wealth isn't real. The other is lovely widow Vivian who was a successful book editor and who is under the impression that Herb is really a doctor, not a dancer. Vivian came on board on the ship with her daughter and her newlywed husband to help her start dating again. After finally telling her the truth, Herb soon finds himself quite attracted to Vivian, and eventually the feeling becomes mutual. However, Herb is still very much in love with Susie which conflicts his very growing feelings for Vivian, leading him to eventually stand her up on the day that they were supposed to view the rare solar eclipse together. Charlie doesn't know that Liz is broke and came onboard the ship to land a rich man.\n\nBy the time Charlie literally drags ship owner Mrs. Carruthers across the dance floor in a clumsy manner, yet surprisingly greatly pleases Mrs. Carruthers. Charlie sets up Mrs. Caruthers to meet in the latter's room under difference circumstances that neither are true. He being told he's about to get a big promotion and her thinking he's romantically interested in her. This was set in motion to enable Charlie to continue his charade and he and Liz spend the night together. During the eclipse, Charlie and Liz propose to each other and make plans to get married immediately. Liz's mom is ecstatic to having landed a rich guy, yet Liz has lost interest in how much money Charlie may have and is truly falling in love with him. However, Gil, figuring out that Charlie was in his room busts him in front of Liz and her mother who promptly dumps him and they decide to leave the cruise immediately. They make their getaway with Vivian on a plane.\n\nHerb decides against starting a new relationship with Vivian until Charlie reminds him that Susie was \"his\" sister long before she was Herb's wife, emphasizing that Susie would never want Herb to spend the rest of his life completely alone and unhappy.\n\nHerb and Charlie both realizing they are really in love with the women decide to go after them. Herb and Charlie are preparing to launch a lifeboat to get off the ship. Gil finds them and Herb finally stands up to him and tells him off. This sets off Gil who goes on a total tirade as Herb & Charlie leave, however Mrs. Caruthers is there with two other dance hosts and hears him say disparaging remarks about her. She promptly fires him, calling him an asshole and giving his job to one of the other dance hosts. Herb and Charlie find the plane trying to fly and call out to all to come back. They set off a flare that Vivian sees and reminds him of a story he told her. The plans lands and everyone tells the truth about everything. Charlie and Liz still continue dating, but Charlie made some good money that he won on a poker game from a rich guy that he had originally torn up to impress Liz and he later taped it back together. Herb and Vivian are together as well.\n\nEnd credits show bloopers and that Gil is now just a dance host and is absolutely miserable.\n\nThe movie received an unenthusiastic review from Janet Maslin in \"The New York Times\". She described the film as a \"weak but genial romp.\" She credits Brent Spiner as a funny \"scene-stealer\" and says that Ms DeHaven is \"almost as pretty\" in this film as she was in Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" (1936), and says that Donald O'Connor's dancing \"draw[s] a well-deserved round of applause\".\n\nThe film currently holds a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10.

The family descended from the Sussex branch of the Thames Valley family of Whistler, as did Rex Whistler and his brother the glass engraver Sir Laurence Whistler.\n\nWhistler was educated at Merchant Taylors School, London and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, before studying medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. After practising as a surgeon (like his maternal grandfather James Watts, MRCS, of Battle, Sussex), he was ordained deacon in 1884 and priest in 1885. He then served successively as curate of Woolton, Liverpool (1884–1885), Chaplain of the Fishermen's Chapel, Hastings (1885–1888), Vicar of All Saints' Church, Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire (1888–1894), Rector of Elton, Huntingdonshire, 1894–1895, Vicar of Stockland Bristol, Somerset (1895–1909), and finally Rector of Cheselbourne, Dorset (1909–1913).\n\nWhistler was married on 3 March 1886 to Georgiana Rosalie Shapter Strange, daughter of William James Stevenson Strange, a master wool-dyer by then retired. His brother Alfred James Whistler married Georgiana's sister Mary Maud Strange. The two women's brother, W. R. P.Strange, had been Vicar of Stockland before Whistler.\n\nWhistler's interest in the history of England before the Norman Conquest appears in his prolific work as a historical novelist. His works were popular in their day, but the archaism of language he adopted makes them less accessible to modern readers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The town was established in 1899 on Selukwe goldfield, which itself was discovered in the early 1890s not long after the annexation of Rhodesia by the Pioneer Column.\n\nThe town lies in well wooded, hilly and picturesque country at an altitude of about 1,440 metres (4700') and is well watered having a typical annual rainfall of 89 cm (3'). On a clear day it is quite possible to see the hills around Masvingo and Great Zimbabwe, the latter being over 145 km (90 miles) away.\n\nSelukwe was established in 1899 by the British South Africa Company and Willoughby's Consolidated Company. Its name was derived from a nearby bare oval granite hill that resembled the shape of a pigpen (selukwe) of the local Karanga people.\n\nThe district remains an important centre for gold, chrome and platinum mining, but is perhaps best known as the home district of the former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Douglas Smith who owned a farm near Gwenoro Dam.\n\nThe town is the terminus of a branch rail line from Gweru (formerly Gwelo), 32 km (21 miles) to the north. Shurugwi is one of Zimbabwe's largest producers of chrome; other metals also are mined there. Its healthful climate and scenic location attract tourists and retired people. The largest employers are ZIMASCO, Unki mine, a subsidiary of Anglo-American through its platinum wing, Angloplats, the government through education, agriculture and health.\n\nMost farmers are peasant farmers who grow maize and other high grain producing crops. Animal husbandry is also practised to some extent.\n\nThe town is located on a mineral-rich Archaean greenstone belt, known in this area as the Selukwe Schist Belt, making it one of the most mineral-rich towns in the country. Chromite, gold and nickel are all mined around Shurugwi. The town is also located on one of the most beautiful places in Zimbabwe, Wolfshall Pass, commonly known as Boterekwa due to the winding of the road as it negotiates its way up and between mountains. This is very similar to the pass close to Louis Trichardt in South Africa since both were constructed by an Italian firm, the difference only being that there are tunnels in Louis Trichardt. It has been a scene of many road accidents with most of them fatal. The most notable of these accidents occurred in 1966 when a bus load of students from Chrome Secondary School overturned. Only three teachers survived the crash.\n\nMost of the infrastructure in Shurugwi is very old. There was only one hotel in the town center – the Grand Hotel, which used to operate as a bar before it was turned into a shop for building materials and motor spare parts. Slowly the town of Shurugwi is being transformed to suit all kinds of business activities unlike what it used to be only gold trade center. The population have doubled as compared to the last decade. Apart from mining, it is now growing into an agriculture sector.\n\nThere are a number of schools in Shurugwi including Parkinson High, Chrome High, Shurugwi 2, Batanai High School, Charles Wraith Primary, Railway block primary, Selukwe peak primary, Ironsides primary etc. Most of the better schools are found in Shurugwi rural area, such as Pakame Mission, one of the oldest schools in the country, a Methodist run mission school which is about 40 km (25 miles) by road on the South towards Zvishavane, close to Guruguru Mountain, a volcanic solid rock mountain in Shurugwi Rural Areas; Tongogara High School, a government operated boarding school 40 km (25 miles) to the East and Hanke Adventist High School, an SDA run school 10 km (6 miles) on the North of Tongogara. Next to Hanke there is a school called Svika High named after a nearby Svika mountain which are the rural areas of Francis Nhema the Zanu Pf Member of Parliament for Shurugwi North. All these schools offer up to Advanced Level (\"A-Level\") education.\n\nThere are also some post-independence-era schools with basically poor standards of education with pass rates of below 5% on Ordinary Level (O-levels) which is due to a lack of quality teachers who normally do not want to teach in rural areas. Rusununguko Secondary School which is along the Chivi/Beit Bridge road is one of the few schools to attain A-level status in its class.\n\nShurugwi also has rural primary schools such as Vungwi Primary School, Matamba Primary School, Tumba Primary Schools,Dhlemiti Primary school,Chironde Primary school,Zvizhazha Primary School,Mavedzenge Primary School,Musavezi Primary School and Nhema Primary School. Most of the graduates leave Shurugwi after primary/secondary education to pursue further education, usually A levels, in other towns as far as Harare. A relative minority ultimately end up studying at the University of Zimbabwe and other post independent universities in Zimbabwe or even at universities abroad. Shurugwi has produced a considerable number of professionals, notably in the fields of Chartered Accountants, lawyers, engineers, and medical doctors. There is a private college Institute of Business Technology popularly known as IBT College, founded by Dr Godfrey Gandawa, that offers academic school forms 1 to 6, and professional and computing courses at national foundation certificate, national certificate and national diploma levels with HEXCO examination status.\n\nMhangami Primary School is an Anglican church run school. Originally called St Pius, it was renamed Mhangami in honour of the local Chief Mhangami. The school was established in 1943 and offers up to grade 7.\n\n"}

He was the chief of the War Affairs section of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nGiven his relatively high station, Arao acted as the representative of the plotters to some extent, hoping to enlist the aid of Minister of War Korechika Anami. Meeting with Anami on the night of August 13 (two days before the surrender), Arao was informed that the Minister stood behind the Emperor's decisions, and that in any case, Japan could not afford to continue fighting. Unthinkable as it was, surrender was the only option.\n\nAs one of his chief contributions to the \"coup\", Arao drafted an 'Instruction to the Troops' which was to be broadcast to all of Japan's soldiers, encouraging them to keep fighting. This was originally supported and approved by General Anami; however, while he spoke with the War Minister, several of the more rash members of the conspiracy broadcast an earlier, more inflammatory, draft.\n\nThe following morning, Arao and the other conspirators met to plot the actual details of their plan to take over the Imperial Palace, placing the Emperor under house arrest, and preventing the surrender speech from being delivered. Arao drafted the orders that were to be given to those elements of the Imperial Guards Division and other groups involved in the \"coup\". The conspirators then met with Anami once more; the Minister, having wavered back and forth several times in his support of their plan, once again told them the \"coup\" would have to be abandoned. He said that Army Chief of Staff Yoshijirō Umezu felt that employment of armed forces within the Palace grounds would be sacrilege.\n\nThough he was one of the original conspirators, Arao in the end turned his back on the \"coup\", and helped write the generals' agreement document stating that those military commanders who signed swore to abide by the Emperor's decision.\n\nUnlike many of the other conspirators, Arao survived through the events of August 15, 1945, and would, many years later, continue to admire General Anami, and the devotion and strength it took to bring the war to an end in the way he did.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2272520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272520", "title": "Matsudaira clan", "text": "Matsudaira clan\n\nThe was a Japanese samurai clan that descended from the Minamoto clan. It originated in and took its name from Matsudaira village, in Mikawa Province (modern-day Aichi Prefecture). During the Sengoku period, the chieftain of the main line of the Matsudaira clan, Matsudaira Motoyasu became a powerful regional daimyo under Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi and changed his name to Tokugawa Ieyasu. He subsequently seized power as the first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate which ruled Japan during the Edo period until the Meiji restoration of 1868. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, many cadet branches of the clan retained the Matsudaira surname, and numerous new branches were formed in the decades after Ieyasu. Some of those branches were also of \"daimyō\" status.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the \"han\" system, the Tokugawa and Matsudaira clans became part of the new nobility.\n\nThe Matsudaira clan originated in Mikawa Province. Its origins are uncertain, but in the Sengoku era, the clan claimed descent from the medieval Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. According to this claim, the founder of the Matsudaira line was Matsudaira Chikauji, who lived in the 14th century and established himself in Mikawa Province, at Matsudaira village.\n\nThe location of Matsudaira village is within the borders of the modern city of Toyota, Aichi. A number of locations associated with the early history of the clan were collectively designated a National Historic Site of Japan in the year 2000. These include:\n\n\nIn its territory in Mikawa Province, the Matsudaira clan was surrounded by much more powerful neighbors. To the west was the territory of the Oda clan of Owari Province; to the east, the Imagawa clan of Suruga. Each generation of Matsudaira family head had to carefully negotiate his relationship with these neighbors.\n\nBefore the Edo period, there were 19 major branches of the Matsudaira clan: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Each of these branches (with the exception of the Kaga-Matsudaira, which relocated to Kaga Province) took its name from the area in Mikawa where it resided. Also, many of the branches often fought with each other.\n\nIt was the main Matsudaira line residing in Okazaki Castle which rose the highest during the Sengoku period. During the headship of Matsudaira Hirotada, it was threatened by the Oda and Imagawa clans, and for a time was forcibly brought into Imagawa service. After the death of Imagawa Yoshimoto and the fall from power of the Imagawa clan, Hirotada's son Matsudaira Motoyasu was successful in forming an alliance with Oda Nobunaga, the hegemon of Owari Province. Motoyasu is better known as Tokugawa Ieyasu, who became the first Tokugawa shōgun in 1603.\n\nSeveral of the pre-Edo branch families survived into the Edo period; some of them became \"daimyōs\". The Takiwaki-Matsudaira family became \"daimyōs\" of the Ojima Domain, and from 1868 to 1871, ruled the Sakurai Domain. The Nagasawa-Matsudaira, also known as the Ōkōchi-Matsudaira, had several branches, one of them ruled the Yoshida Domain of Mikawa Province. A prominent Nagasawa-Matsudaira is the early Edo-period politician Matsudaira Nobutsuna. The Fukōzu-Matsudaira ruled the Shimabara Domain. The Sakurai-Matsudaira ruled the Amagasaki Domain. The Ogyū-Matsudaira had many branches, one of which ruled the Okutono Domain. Nagai Naoyuki was a prominent Bakumatsu-era descendant of the Ogyū-Matsudaira of Okutono. Other pre-Edo branches of the family became hatamoto.\n\nThe Tokugawa surname was not granted to all of the sons of the shōgun or the heads of the six main Tokugawa branches. Only the inheritor received the Tokugawa name, while all of his siblings would receive the Matsudaira surname. For example, the last shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu was not the firstborn heir of his father (Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito). Consequently, Yoshinobu was known as Matsudaira Shichirōma during his minority. Some of these sons, particularly of the 3 main Tokugawa branches (the \"Gosanke\"), formed their own families, and received their own fiefs. These included Takamatsu, Shishido, Fuchū, and Moriyama (branches of the Mito Tokugawa); Saijō (a branch of the Kii Tokugawa); and Takasu (a branch of the Owari Tokugawa). Notable Matsudaira of these branches include Matsudaira Yoritoshi of Takamatsu, and Matsudaira Yoritaka of Fuchū. Yoritsune Matsudaira and his son Yoriaki Matsudaira, who were 20th-century composers, were descendants of the Matsudaira of Fuchū.\n\nThe Yūki-Matsudaira clan was founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu's son Yūki Hideyasu. Several branches of the Yūki-Matsudaira came into existence during the Edo period. Though the Yūki-Matsudaira retained control of Kitanoshō (later renamed Fukui), the main Yūki line was not there, but in Tsuyama instead. Branches of the family ruled the Fukui, Hirose, Mori, Matsue, Tsuyama, Akashi, Itoigawa, and Maebashi domains. Famous Yūki-Matsudaira include Matsudaira Naritami and Matsudaira Yoshinaga, two \"daimyōs\" of the late Edo period. Matsudaira Yoshinaga in particular was very important to Japanese politics of the early Meiji period, and his leadership put the Fukui Domain on the side of the victors in the Boshin War (1868–69).\n\nThe Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan was founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu's half-brother Hisamatsu Sadakatsu. Due to his close relation to Ieyasu, Sadakatsu was allowed the use of the Matsudaira surname. Eventually, some of the branches of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira were also allowed the use of the Tokugawa family crest, as well as being formally recognized as Tokugawa relatives (\"shinpan\"), rather than simply being a \"fudai\" family. Branches of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira ruled the Kuwana, Imabari, and Iyo-Matsuyama domains. Famous Hisamatsu-Matsudaira include the political reformer Matsudaira Sadanobu, the final Kyoto Shoshidai Matsudaira Sadaaki, and shogunate politician Itakura Katsukiyo. In the Meiji era, the heads of all the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira branches received titles in the new nobility.\n\nThe Ochi-Matsudaira clan was founded by Matsudaira Kiyotake, the younger brother of the 6th shōgun Tokugawa Ienobu. The Ochi-Matsudaira ruled the Hamada Domain. The family lost most of its territory in 1866, when the castle town was occupied by Chōshū Domain forces under Ōmura Masujirō during the Chōshū War. Matsudaira Takeakira, the last \"daimyō\", escaped Hamada and went to Tsuruta, one of the domain's non-contiguous territories; there he set up the Tsuruta Domain, which existed until the abolition of the domains in 1871. In the Meiji era, Takeakira's son Matsudaira (Ochi) Takenaga received the title of viscount.\n\nThe Hoshina-Matsudaira clan was founded by Hoshina Masayuki. Masayuki, a son of the second shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada, was adopted by Hoshina Masamitsu, the lord of the Takatō Domain. Masayuki was recognized as a relative of the Tokugawa family by his half-brother Tokugawa Iemitsu; after Iemitsu's death, Masayuki served as a regent for his nephew, the underaged shōgun Tokugawa Ietsuna, thus effectively running the shogunate. It was at this time that Masayuki received rulership of the fief of Aizu (with an income of 230,000 \"koku\"). Two generations later, during the reign of the 3rd lord Masakata, the family was allowed the use of the Matsudaira surname and crest. The family remained prominent in shogunate affairs and in security duty in Ezo (Hokkaido). It also sponsored several schools of martial arts, as well as working to develop and spread the production of local crafts. In the Bakumatsu period, the 8th lord Matsudaira Katataka assisted with security duties during and after the arrival of the Perry Expedition; Katataka's successor, 9th lord Matsudaira Katamori served as \"Kyoto Shugoshoku\", but his clan was later defeated in the Boshin War. The Aizu-Matsudaira survived the Meiji Restoration, and were ennobled with the title of viscount. Katamori's son Morio Matsudaira served as an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The family survives to the present day. Isao Matsudaira, who was governor of Fukushima Prefecture in the 1980s, was a descendant of this family. Princess Chichibu Setsuko, the wife of Emperor Hirohito's brother Prince Chichibu Yasuhito, was another.\n\nOver the course of the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate granted the use of the Matsudaira surname to certain families as an honorific. These families included both \"fudai\" and \"tozama daimyō\" families. The Date clan of Sendai, the Shimazu clan of Satsuma, the Mōri clan of Choshu, the Maeda clan of Kaga (and its branches at Daishōji and Toyama), the Yamanouchi clan of Tosa, the Kuroda clan of Fukuoka, the Asano clan of Hiroshima (and its branch at Hiroshima-shinden), the Nabeshima of Saga, the Ikeda of Tottori (as well as its branches of Okayama, Shikano, Wakazakura, Hirafuku, as well as hatamoto-level Ikeda), and the Hachisuka of Tokushima were all \"tozama\" families that had the use of the Matsudaira surname. The Yanagisawa clan of Yamato and Honjō clan of Miyazu were two \"fudai\" families among those who had the right to use the Matsudaira surname. In addition, if a Tokugawa princess married into another family, her husband had the right to use the Matsudaira surname and the Tokugawa crest for one generation.\n\nProminent Matsudaira in the present day include Ryūmon Matsudaira (actor), and Sadatomo Matsudaira (anchor for NHK), among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\nGerman\nJapanese\n\n"}

The principality became part of the scattered holdings of the house of Orange-Nassau from the time that William the Silent inherited the title of Prince of Orange from his cousin in 1544, until it was finally ceded to France in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht. Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant Royal House of the Netherlands. The area of the principality was approximately long by wide, or .\n\nThe Carolingian counts of Orange had their origin in the 8th century, and the fief passed into the family of the lords of Baux. The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the Kingdom of Arles after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by Charles IV when he was in Arles for his coronation as king of Arles.\n\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers (Mary of Baux-Orange and Jean de Châlons of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of Dauphiné.\n\nIn 1544, William the Silent, count of Nassau, with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of René of Châlon who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars. René, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange. René's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Châlon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the House of Orange. This pitched it into the Protestant side in the Wars of Religion, during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the Eighty Years' War began with William as Stadtholder of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in Delft in 1584. It was his son, Maurice of Nassau (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a Huguenot stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as William III of England, was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of Louis XIV under François Adhémar de Monteil Comte de Grignan, in 1672 during the Franco-Dutch War, and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule. In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between Frederick I of Prussia and John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'. In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed François Louis, Prince of Conti, a relative of the Châlon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the Treaty of Utrecht, Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the Treaty of Partage, did John William Friso's successor William IV, Prince of Orange, renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the Dauphiné.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French \"département\" of Drôme in 1790, then Bouches-du-Rhône, then finally Vaucluse.\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the United Provinces was not revived but replaced into the Kingdom of the United Netherlands, under a King of the House of Orange-Nassau. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna took care of a French sensitivity by stipulating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands would be ruled by the House of Oranje-Nassau – \"Oranje\", not \"Orange\" as had been the custom until then. The English language, however, continues to use the term \"Orange-Nassau\".\n\nNowadays, both Georg Friedrich of Prussia and Dutch crown princess Amalia carry the title \"Prince(ss) of Orange\", Amalia in the official form of \"Prinses van Oranje\".\n\nThe territory of the principality is 180 square kilometers. It measures 19 km long and 15 km wide, and is oriented with its base on the eastern bank of the Rhône extending east to west towards . It also includes several enclaves in the Dauphiné.\nThe principality comprised the following towns:\n\nThe capital of the principality was the castle, fortress and town of Orange. The castle and fortress sat on an outcropping of rock from the with the town below. The natural defense provided by the escarpment allowed the princes to control all the approaches to Orange and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean. It also made the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time until Louis XIV overwhelmed it with his armies in 1672.\n\nIn the 12th century, , daughter , \nrebuilt the Roman walls of the town and rehabilitated the ancient \"castrum Aurasice\". In the 14th century, the Les Baux princes of Orange consolidated the donjon and rampart of the chateau in order to resist the assaults the \"grandes compagnies\" that were devastating Provence at the time. The population of the town was concentrated around the fortress in an area much smaller than the ancient Roman town. Prince Jean de Chalon added three wings to the dungeon in the last years of the century, which gave it a square shape.\n\nBy the 17th century, the chateau had suffered damage due to the French Wars of Religion. Much of the essential defenses were in need of complete rebuilding. The incumbent prince of Orange, the celebrated general Maurice of Nassau, executed a plan by the architect Servole to build a fortress incorporating the modern science of fortification he had pioneered in his wars in the Netherlands. The fortress was composed of three parts: the 14th century castle, the curtain wall, and the \"Vignasse\", an esplanade, says Joseph of Pisa, capable of containing 10,000 men at arms. The entire complex and the city were surrounded by moats and Bastion fort walls to protect against cannon fire similar to the fortifications of towns in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen completed, the citadel consisted of 11 bastions connected by curtain walls and ditches. It was built with walls of extraordinary thickness extending over the whole hill. It was heavily fortified and garrisoned. In 1672, in reprisal for the young William III, prince of Orange and \"stadtholder\" of Holland defending the interests of his nation and of the Protestant religion, Louis XIV instructed the count of Grignan to lay siege to the citadel and to destroy it. It was necessary to use gunpowder to demolish the enormous walls of which one can see today some vestiges on the hill. In 1991, an excavation was carried out to study this architectural and military features.\n\nDue to its connection with the Dutch royal family, Orange gave its name to other Dutch-influenced parts of the world, such as the Orange River and the Orange Free State in South Africa, and Orange County in the U.S. state of New York. The town of Orange, Connecticut is named after the principality.\n\nThe orange portion of the flag of Ireland, invented in 1848, represents Irish Protestants, who were grateful for their rescue by William III of England (\"William of Orange\") in 1689–1691. The flag of South Africa from 1928 to 1994 had an orange upper stripe and was very similar to the old Dutch flag, also called Prince's Flag, because it was inspired by the history of the Afrikaners, who are chiefly of Dutch descent.\n\nThe flag of New York City and the flag of Albany, New York (which was originally known as Fort Orange) also each have an orange stripe to reflect the Dutch origins of those cities. In turn, orange is included in the team colors of the New York Mets, the New York Knicks, and the New York Islanders. It is also a team color of the San Francisco Giants, which was a New York team until 1957.\n\nThe color orange is still the national color of the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Dutch flag originally had an orange stripe instead of a red, and today an orange pennant is still flown above the flag on Koningsdag. Dutch national sports teams usually compete in orange, and a wide variety of orange-colored items are displayed by Dutch people on occasions of national pride or festivity.\n\n"}

He passed through Edinburgh University to the Scottish bar, and was chief authority on genealogical cases.\n\nMaidment's hobby was the collection of literary rarities. He edited and published editions of ancient literary remains including \"A Book of Scottish Pasquils, 1568-1715\", a selection from the papers of the family of Boyd of Kilmarnock from the 16th and 17th centuries, state papers and miscellaneous correspondence of Thomas, Baron Melros (from the 17th century), letters and state papers during the reign of King James the Sixth, chiefly from the manuscript collections of Sir James Balfour of Denmylne, constitutions, charters etc. of the nunnery of Sciennes, 1512–88, and \"Scottish Ballads and Songs: Historical and Traditionary\".\n\nMaidment was also a poet and a friend of Sir Walter Scott. A collection of his poems is held at the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas.\n\nHe was born in London about 1795; his father was a solicitor. Called to the Scottish bar in 1817, he soon took a high position as an advocate in cases involving genealogical inquiry, and was much involved in disputed peerage cases. He lived at 25 Royal Crescent on the northern edge of the Second New Town in Edinburgh.\n\nHe died in Edinburgh, 24 October 1879, and was buried with his family in the Dean Cemetery. The grave lies in the first northern extension.\n\nHe was an extensive collector, and the sale, in May 1880, of his library occupied fifteen days.\n\nHe was married to Isabella Jane Stewart (1822-1862). They had several children before she died aged only 40.\n\nMaidment showed an early taste for antiquarian and historical research, and he became friends with Sir Walter Scott, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, and other men of letters. His publications were very numerous, though many were anonymous, and several were privately printed in small editions. He published generally with John Stevenson and his son Thomas George Stevenson. He edited works for the Bannatyne, Maitland, Abbotsford, and Hunterian Clubs, and for the Spottiswoode Society; and he was the main editor of John Kay's \"Edinburgh Portraits\", 2 vols. 1837. One of his major works is the \"Dramatists of the Restoration\",’ 14 vols.

{"id": "2272547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272547", "title": "Marshfield, Gloucestershire", "text": "Marshfield, Gloucestershire\n\nMarshfield is a town in the local government area of South Gloucestershire, England, on the borders of the counties of Wiltshire and Somerset. Toponomy derives from the Old English language word \"March\" meaning a border, hence Border Field would be the literal translation. It is not to do with \"marsh\" in the sense of bog.\n\nMarshfield is at the southern end of the Cotswold Hills, north of Bath, east of Bristol and south of Gloucester. The A420 road bypasses the town on its northern side. To the north of Marshfield is a long stretch of flat-looking fields bordered by dry-stone walls. To the south, the view and the country is quite different, for one is quickly into the wooded valleys and hedge-lined fields of Bath and North East Somerset.\n\nHigh Street is the single main thoroughfare of Marshfield and is approximately 350 m in length and straight. The eastern part of the town contains the parish church, Manor House and Home Farm, a group of historic buildings noted for their architectural features.\n\nAlmost every house along the high street is more than 100 years old, from the Georgian architecture Gothic toll house at the western end to the groups of medieval barn, dovecote, and early Georgian stable range which go with the manor house and Home Farm. Near the toll house stand the fine almshouses of 1612, built for the use of eight elderly villagers by two sons of Marshfield, Nicholas and Ellis Crispe, who had gone to London and made their fortunes largely through the West Indies trade. They endowed the houses with funds to provide a free residence, garden, and £11 yearly. Many houses date from Tudor era and Stuart times (a few were originally timber-framed) and have gables and mullioned windows. Several have bow fronts and there are five examples of shell-pattern door arches typical of Queen Anne work. The finest front in the high street is perhaps the Catherine Wheel some of whose buildings at the rear are much older than 1700.\n\nThe Malting house is a typical example of the village's former prosperity in that trade. Other notable high street buildings include the former Old Meeting, a Presbyterian / Independent, later Unitarian chapel of 1752, the gabled range of the Hospice, the Red House, the former police station (now number 123), numbers 44, 83, 115, and 126.\n\nThe former vicarage, now known as \"Marshfield House\", whose front was rebuilt in the 1730s by Mrs Dionysia Long, is particularly handsome with its barn, stable block, and large walled garden fringing the market place. It has four storeys, including a basement and extensive attics. The vicarage did not have electricity until the 1950s, in fact only two of the floors had electricity in the early 1980s. The last vicar to inhabit the old vicarage was Rev John Miskin Prior. Following his departure from the village in 1982, a new vicarage was built on land in Church Lane, and the old vicarage was sold as a private residence.\n\nThe Crown, the Lord Nelson, the Old Inn, and several farms still in the heart of the village are also noteworthy: Weir farm in Weir lane, with its gables, was once a malting house, and Pitt farm, at Little end, is 17th century.\n\nThe Tolzey or Town House was built in 1690 for the people of Marshfield by John and Mary Goslett. As well as being the old town's administrative headquarters (the parish council still meets here) it also housed a Marshfield fire engine and served as a lock-up.\n\nCastle farm is about half a mile to the north of Marshfield. In its farmyard is an ancient longhouse with the original fireplace and the dividing screen between the human and animal dwellings. On the neighbouring land where lynchets show in some fields, many Bronze Age and Stone Age implements have been picked up and a skeleton in a stone coffin discovered.\n\nFormerly there were two mansions to the south of the village; the Rocks, now a ruin, and Ashwicke Hall. The Rocks, covering belonged to the Taylor family, and was originally of Jacobean design. It was visited by the late Queen Mary during her stay at Badminton House in the Second World War. Ashwicke, ancient seat of the Webb family, was bought and rebuilt by John Orred in 1857, replacing an older house that stood nearby. After his death it was bought by the Horlocks who later moved to the Manor House. The hall then passed through other hands and the Firth family sold it to its last private owner, Major Pope, in 1909. The two houses employed many people from the parish in the past and the footpath running from the village to Ashwicke is a reminder of those days of service. On this former estate is the Rocks East woodland training centre which has several guided walks and wooden sculptures.\n\nThe town is rich in history because of its location in the heart of Cotswold wool country, near to Bath and Bristol. Located within an agricultural area, Marshfield gained market status in 1234. The layout conforms to that of a typical market town with long narrow burgage plot gardens extending back from the narrow frontages, and served by two rear access lanes (Back Lane and Weir Lane).\n\nThe majority of buildings lining the street are of 18th-century origin although several buildings date from the 17th century. The building style is largely Georgian. The facades of the buildings are unified by the consistent use of local stone and other materials, which adds character to the village.\n\nMarshfield was a casualty of the Battle of Lansdown (July 1643) during the Civil War. A Royalist army under Prince Maurice and Sir Bevil Grenville were hoping to link up with Charles I at Oxford and avoid a confrontation with the Parliamentary Forces gathered at Bath under Sir William Waller. Marshfield, which had about 300 houses at that time, on 4 July was used as an overnight billet and provision store for the King's army of 6000. Next day the royalists were tempted into an abortive Battle at Lansdown, each side withdrawing with heavy losses. Sir Bevil Grenville (whose monument now stands on the site of the battle) died in Cold Ashton rectory and as the Royalists fell back on Marshfield for repairs almost every house had wounded men on its hands. When the depleted army moved on the reinforced Cromwellian army soon followed. There was little time to stow away the church's simple treasures before the invading despoilers were at work. As a piece of local doggerel composed 200 years later had it \"The empty niche above the door, where Mary's image stood, And ravaged reredos testify to their revengeful mood.\"\n\nIt is not known just what damage may have been done as a result of the Civil War. Canon Trotman, a prominent authority in Marshfield's more recent past, speculated publicly about the likely missing treasures. He noticed the large stones on either side of the east window, with rough infilling under them. The large stones evidently formed canopies for figures now missing and which have been the marble figures found in 1866 during alterations at the Angel Inn (now 42 high Street) and later removed from the parish. Two or three other figures probably completed the statuary. Canon Trotman further presumed that the figure of the Virgin may have been taken from its niche in the porch by the Parliamentary troops, but adds forcefully, \"Even they could scarcely have done more havoc with the church than the hand of the so-called restorer in 1860 who, while substituting the pitch pine seats...for the old carefully locked pews and capacious gallery, effaced at the same time much that should have been interesting to us today.\" Canon Trotman (1906).\n\nWith Cromwell's victory in the Civil War, the period of the Commonwealth ensued during which time marriage was treated as a secular rather than religious ceremony. John Goslett as a magistrate therefore married 92 couples during that period from the parish and around, in may cases the banns having been called on three successive market days in the market Place at Marshfield (as an alternative banns could still be read in church). There was clearly no long-term disadvantage in all this for Mr Goslett for a tablet to his memory was nevertheless placed in the church, beside the east window of the north aisle.\n\nDavid Long, from Pennsylvania, reports that on the flat open land between his village and the lane you can often find musket balls, on the battlefield of Lansdown. Looking towards the battle site from the field it would appear to be a logical distance away particularly as they would have been firing uphill at about 45 degrees thus landing some distance from the battle site.\n\nThe wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon the cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor. And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-doorAlfred Noyes, The Highwayman.\n\nSomewhere near to the Three Shire Stones on the Fosse Way near Marshfield there lies, even to this day, a stone that marks the spot of what the Bath Journal calls \"wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\". The stone marked E.R. 1761 referred to one Edmund Roach aged 38 years who was set upon by a highwayman. 'We are this instant informed, that one Edmund Roach, of Marshfield, a Chandler (candlemaker) was found dead near Westwood, on the Turnpike road leading from this city to Colerne gate; and from all circumstances that yet appear, was murdered and robbed, marks of violence appearing about his head, his pockets pulled out, and his silver watch and money gone. He is supposed to have had in his pockets four 36 shilling pieces and some guineas. All the marks of the watch that can yet be recollected are, the dial plate pretty much soiled, the black enamel figures on it much worn off and had lately a new spring put in it, a pale narrow old silk string of ribbon, a brass key, and a common brass seal set with glass, and a head engraved on it'. The report indicates a reward for the highwayman if found with information requested by Mrs. Eleanor Roach.\n\nOn 27 July 1761, Since our last a man has been apprehended on suspicion of the murder and robbery of Mr. Roach last Saturday se'en night in the evening; he says he formerly belonged to the regiment of Royal Gloucestershire Hussars Y. Buffs, (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) but, having a rupture, was discharged, and that he supported himself by travelling about the country, his account of supporting himself, however was so lame, he is committed to a place of security at Devices for further examination. This could have been the former Roundway Hospital near Devizes, Wiltshire. Roundway wasn't opened until 1845 so maybe he was taken to a Village lock-up near there.\n\nSunday morning last a tallow chandler and a dealer in horses of Marshfield in the county of Glouscestershire was found dead near Westwood on the road leading from this city to Colerne in the county of Wiltshire. He left Bath Saturday evening on horseback and his horse strayed the same night to Colerne. Monday coroners inquest sat on the body and brought in their verdict of wilful murder several marks of violence occurring particularly violent blow on the back part of his head supposed to occasion his death (Which blow it is thought was given by a large knotty stick that was found, bloody, near the place he was murdered and the print of a women's foot was plainly to be distinguished on the lower part of his belly. His pockets were turned inside out and his watch and money (amounting to £10:00) taken from thence- Monday evening, a woman enquiring for lodgeings, at Colerne for herself and husband was asked concerning her place of abode and not giving satisfactory answers caused some suspicion. She was thereupon strictly examined to touching the said murder and robbery. After some hesitation she confessed that her husband and some others had robbed the aforesaid Mr Roach and gave intelligence as to where her husband was to be met with. He was accordingly apprehended the next morning at Kington St. Michael in the said county of Wilts. He appears to be a seafaring man and on his examination confessed the robbery but denied the murder declaring that he found the deceased lying dead on the road having (as he supposed) been killed by a fall from his horse, he added, that he thought it no crime to rob a dead man he appears very resolute and yesterday a tinker was apprehended who has confessed his being concerned in the said murder and robbery and has impeached two other accomplices, besides that above mentioned who are likewise sailors. Diligent search is making after them.\n\nMr. Roach was buried at Marshfield with the following epitaph on his headstone:\n\n\"BY MURD'ROUS BLOW MY THREAD OF LIFE WAS BROKE.\nDREADFUL THE HOUR! AND TERRIBLE THE STROKE!\nBUT HEAVEN PERMITTED! AND I MUST NOT LIVE.\nREPENT, THOU CURST DESTROYER OF MY LIFE.\nBEHOLD ME HERE, BEHOLD MY BABES AND WIFE!\nSEE, FROM THY BLOODY HAND WHAT WOES ARISE.\nWHILE CALLS FOR VENGEANCE PIERCE THE ANGRY SKIES.\nTHOU TOO MUST SUFFER, THO 'THOU' SCAPE THE LAWS.\nFOR GOD IS JUST AND WILL AVENGE MY CAUSE.\nMY CHILDREN DEAR, MY WIFE, MY WIDOWED FRIEND.\nMAY PEACE AND SAFETY ON YOUR STEPS ATTEND.\nMAY VIRTUE GUIDE, AND TRUTH YOUR LIVES EMPLOY,\nTHEN SLOW OR SUDDEN DEATH WILL END IN JOY.\n\nOne rendezvous for Dick Turpin on the London-Bath road was reputed to be Star Farm, formerly a posting-house, half a mile east of Marshfield. On 7 July 1763. A highwayman robbed a gentleman's servant of 5/- at Tog Hill turning, amongst other robberies. He is described as being a short young man, much pitted with the small pox ; well mounted on a dark brown horse with a flick tail and blind in one eye. One of the stirrups is new and the other old, and the highwayman had on a brown surtout coat. He later that day fatally injured a pig killer at Wickwar, named Daniel Neale the highwayman.\n\nOn 29 January 1798 three highwaymen well-mounted and armed, stopped Mr Stephen Toghill of Marshfield at Lynch Hill and with dreadful imprecations, demanded his money, which he hesitating to comply with one of them struck him on the arm with such violence as to deprive him of the use of it. Another with a knife cut his breeches from the waistband through his pocket down to the knee and robbed him of notes amounting to £43. Mr Toghill has offered a reward of £50 for discovering the offenders.\n\nThe village fire engine was purchased in 1826 for £50:00 and was still in use in 1931. It had to be operated by a gang of men on either side of it using a hand pump.\nIn 1896 the Fire Brigade had its capabilities tested to the utmost. Two houses with thatched roofs, in the main streets, caught fire at Mid-day, when all hands were engaged in the fields, but the Brigade mustered quickly in sufficient force to prevent fire spreading to other houses.\n\nSt Mary's parish church with its tower provides an important focal point that can be observed from numerous points in the village and is a landmark visible from miles around. The church is on the eastern side of the village. A church has stood on that site for more than 1,000 years. The first was dedicated to St Nicholas, and at west Marshfield there was another, of which no traces remain, to St Pancras. It is thought that a field called St Pancras Close marks the site. In Bristol Museum there is an ancient deed of about 1125 confirming to the Abbot of Tewkesbury various tithes and ecclesiastical benefices, among them Marshfield church, at that time very much smaller than the church we see today.\n\nIt is recorded in the annals of Tewkesbury Abbey that on 1 June 1242, in the reign of Henry III, Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester, in whose diocese Marshfield then stood, came to dedicate a newly built church at Marshfield. The monks of Tewkesbury Abbey restored and rebuilt the church in the perpendicular style in about 1470. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the right of presentation of the benefice was given to the warden and fellows of New College, Oxford, by Queen Mary, in lieu of property of which they had been robbed by Henry VIII of England. The college's first incumbent came into residence in 1642, only to be disposed during the English Civil War. New College still has the benefice in its gift.\n\nA chalice of 1576 and a paten probably dating from 1695 are in regular use, and Communion plate given by the Long family in 1728, including two large flagons, is used for the Christmas Eve midnight service each year. The church was restored in 1860 and more carefully in 1887 and 1902-3 under Canon Trotman. The chapel of St Clement in the north aisle was restored to its original design in 1950 as a memorial to the late Major Pope of Ashwicke Hall, a considerable benefactor of Marshfield. A new cemetery to the north of the village was opened in 1932, the churchyard being full.\n\nThe Parish Register dates from 1558, the first years of Elizabeth I's reign. The first two volumes were indexed and fifty copies printed by a London antiquarian in the time of Canon Trotman. For the first 150 years entries were generally written in Latin and initially only baptisms were recorded, burials being first entered in 1567 and marriages five years later.\nNon-conformist worshippers in the village are served by Baptist and Congregational chapels, and by Hebron Hall. Conversion of an old barn into the present church hall was done in 1933 at a cost of £650.\n\nAccording to inscriptions on the village's War Memorial 27 villagers died in action during the two Wars, 20 men during World War I 1914 - 1918 and 7 men during World War II 1939 - 1945.\n\nA Community Centre was built in 1991 following a long running campaign to secure the land and the funding. It was developed to provide the village with a full sized sports hall, a second smaller hall, a large kitchen and a light and open foyer area.\nIn 2003, the Community Centre was extended to provide a carefully designed, bespoke building for the Marshfield Pre-School. During 2011, this was further improved by the development of a special sensory garden, just for pre school to enjoy.\nThe Community Centre is available for rent to local groups and other groups/organisations further afield.\n\nEvery Boxing Day at 11:00am increasing numbers of visitors come to the village to see the performance of the celebrated Marshfield Mummers or The old time paper boys. Seven figures, led by the Town Crier with his handbell, dressed in costumes made from strips of newsprint and coloured paper, perform their play several times along the high street. Beginning in the Market place after the Christmas Hymns which are led by the vicar the mummers arrive to the sound of the lone bell. The five-minute performances follow the same set and continue up to the almshouses. The final performance is outside of one of the local public houses where the landlord delivers a tot of whisky for the \"Boys\".\n\nThere is evidence of mummers' plays since circa 1141. The Marshfield play was discontinued in the 1880s when a number of the players died of influenza but it was resurrected after the Second World War. In the past centuries the mummers were probably a band of villagers who toured the large houses to collect money for their own Christmas festivities. During the latter half of the 19th century the play lapsed, presumably for lack of interest. The play was not entirely forgotten however. Then, in 1931, the Reverend Alford, vicar of Marshfield, heard his gardener mumbling the words 'Room, room, a gallant room, I say' and discovered that this line was part of a mummers' play. The vicar's sister Violet Alford, a leading folklorist, encouraged the survivors of the troupe and some new members, including Tom Robinson (whose place was later taken by his brother), to revive the tradition. There was some dispute between Miss Alford and the elderly villagers as to how the play should actually be performed, and the resulting revival was a compromise which differs in several respects from other versions: St George has apparently become King William and Father Christmas appears as an extra character. The costumes, as well as the play's symbolism, are relics of an ancient and obscure original- perhaps the earliest performers were clad in leaves or skins, symbolizing the death and rebirth of nature.\n\nThe Paper Boys' play is a fertility rite with traces of medieval drama and incorporates the story of St George and the Dragon. It was never written down, and over the centuries, it gradually changed through the addition of ad libs and misunderstandings. The nonsensical corruptions of the text reveal its origins as a story told by illiterate peasant folk, unaware of all its allusions. There have to be seven characters as seven was thought to be a magic number. They include Old Father Christmas (the presenter of the play), King William who slays Little Man John who is resurrected by Dr Finnix (Phoenix, a rebirth theme). There's also Tenpenny Nit, Beelzebub who carries a club and a money pan and Saucy Jack who talks about some of his children dying—there are many references in mummers' plays about social hardship.\n\nThe Paper Boys have to belong to families that have lived in Marshfield for generations and they must have the Marshfield accent. When a role becomes available, precedence is given to the relatives of present members of the troupe. Because it is a fertility rite, women are not allowed to participate. Each costume comprises a garment made of brown cloth covered in sewn-on strips of newspaper—hence the name 'Paper Boys'. Each mummer maintains his own costume, repairing it as necessary. It is thought that, in the distant past the costumes bore leaves instead of paper strips.\n\nMarshfield is justly proud of its special local tradition revived now for more than 40 years and looks forward each year to the social gathering each Boxing Day. The mummers have been featured on radio and television and at events of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. A few years ago they featured on the Rev. Lionel Fanthorpes \"Fortean TV\" aired on Channel 4. In 2002 they featured in a programme by Johnny Kingdom.\n\nUntil 25 October 1962, two fairs were held annually in Marshfield, one on 24 March and the other on 24 October. The fairs were first held in 1266 when the Abbot of Keynsham purchased the right and this privilege was confirmed in 1462. The rights of the fair must have passed to the Lord of the Manor at some time because in more recent times they were let to a manager at a yearly rental. In about 1885 the fair was rented by Mark Fishlock from Squire Orred of Ashwicke Hall.\n\nCattle, sheep, and pigs which were brought in for sale were penned in hurdles in front of the houses on one side of the High Street and White hart lane, causing much confusion, and clearing up afterwards. The streets at that time was unpaved. The farmers paid 1d per head for sheep and 2d per head for cattle sold at the fair, but no charge was made for animals not sold. Until more recent times the dealers and farmers bartered among themselves. Tolls had to be paid for all sheep sold at the rate of 4d a score, this being manorial right of the fair. In May 1901 the fair was taken out of the street to a field adjoining Back Lane. It was a large fair at that time and about four or five thousand sheep and 300 cattle were brought on foot from miles around to be sold. The Market Place was generally filled with sideshows of all sorts.\n\nThere were often accidents and during the October 1905, one Thomas White, aged 45, was killed on the roundabouts. Gradually the weekly markets at Bath, Chippenham, and Bridgeyate took the business away from Marshfield fairs: they no longer paid their way therefore and so ended.\n\nFor much of 1940 The Maltings, at 78 High Street was home to several well known cultural figures who were trying to escape the effects of the war. -\n\nThe Hazlitt family also have connections to the village. In 1766 William Hazlitt senior, father of William Hazlitt became minister of the meeting house. John Hazlitt, a noted painter of miniature portraits, was born in the village.\n\nIn Oakford Lane leading down to St Catherine's Valley lived Major Jeremy Taylor who was a Captain in the 23rd Hussars (Tank Regiment) and was decorated in World War II. He grew up on the estate in its heyday. He later worked as an Animal Wrangler in the film \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and performed the \"long\" camel riding shots for Peter O'Toole.\n\n"}

The highway extends for from Interstate 89 exit 13 in South Burlington to US Route 7 at the Burlington city limit. I-189 is the only spur on the entire length of I-89.\n\nI-189 serves as an Interstate-grade connector between I-89 and a commercial district along US 7 (Shelburne Road). It is signed as an east–west highway. Prior to 2010, only one directional sign had been posted on the highway - on the eastbound side after the on-ramp from US 7. Sign replacements and additions in late 2010 added directional signs on both the eastbound and westbound sides of the route.\n\nThere was once a plan for the highway to continue north into the city of Burlington along the waterfront and service an industrial area. Construction was delayed due to the presence of a toxic barge canal and eventually cancelled as the city largely left behind its industrial past in favor of tourism in the 1980s. The roadway was abandoned just beyond the US 7 interchange. As a result, Jersey barriers are in place on I-189 west directing traffic onto the US 7 off-ramp, orphaning approximately of road, along with a few ramps.\nThe Federal Government previously gave the state a deadline to make a final decision on building the extension or they would lose matching funds. As of Spring 2012, consensus is for a two-lane parkway named the \"Champlain Parkway\" that will run northerly from Home Avenue for about , then curve onto existing city streets in order to funnel traffic into downtown away from US 7. I-189 would extend westward, then turn to the north, terminate at Home Avenue, and connect to the parkway.\nIn August 2014, the parkway received its land use permit, clearing the way for the project to begin. Opposition to the $30 million project and changes to its design have led to delays in construction, which has not begun as of 2018.\n"}

The sponsors believed that she would clear older Tenko's huge debt, a speculation which was successful. \n\nShe guest starred as herself in two Metal Hero Series: episode 29 of \"Uchuu Keiji Gavan\" and episode 24 of \"Choujinki Metalder\". She debuted in North America at the Radio City Music Hall in 1994, and subsequently achieved worldwide fame. She was famous to the extent that \"Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic\", an American magical girl-inspired cartoon series based on her character, was created and Mattel produced a line of fashion dolls named after her. In 1996, she became an honorary goodwill ambassador of the African Wild Animal Conservation Fund.\n\nShe was the subject of controversy after making a visit to North Korea in April 1998. It was reported that she met the former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il but she reportedly denied this in interviews. She has stated that the purpose of her visit was to perform at the \"Friendship Art Festival\" held in Pyongyang and to meet Korean artists. She again visited North Korea in 2000 and performed for Kim Jong Il. She was asked to stay in North Korea but refused.\n\nOn July 24, 2007, it was reported that she performed \"The Spike Illusion\", but that the trick went wrong causing serious injury. After being released, she continued the show for a further thirty minutes before terminating it early due to her injuries.\n\nShe was invited to attend the funeral of Kim Jong Il in December 2011, but she declined.\n\n\"Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic\", the cartoon series based on her by Saban, is centered on Princess Tenko leading a team of warriors (Bolt, Hawk, Steel and apprentice Ali) called the Guardians who tried to amass the scattered and stolen magical Starfire Gems, each of which had a special power. Standing against them were twin villains Janna and Jason, who had the power to combine into a two-headed dragon. The cartoon ran for a single season of 13 episodes from 1995 to 1996. At the end of each episode, the real Princess Tenko would appear on stage and perform an illusion or teach a magic trick.\n\n"}

She started her career as a child actress playing bratty bubblegum-chewing Violet Beauregarde in the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"; Allison on \"The Electric Company\"; and Amy Jennings, Nora Collins, and Amy Collins in the soap opera \"Dark Shadows\".\n\nNickerson was born on April 1, 1957, in New York City, to Flo, a clerical worker, and Fred Nickerson, a mail carrier. The family, along with older sister Carol and her son, moved to Miami. Nickerson, at the age of two, worked on a television commercial for a Florida heating company. At the age of four, she was discovered at a fashion show by Broadway Theatre producer Zev Buffman of drama school the Neighborhood Playhouse A few years later, she was in the play \"Peter Pan\" as Wendy's daughter starring Betsy Palmer at Miami's Coconut Grove Playhouse. Buffman selected Nickerson to go on the road with the play, first to Washington, D. C.. When Denise was nine, the play ended. Her parents moved Carol and Nickerson back to New York City at 56th and Lexington in a studio apartment while they (and Shane, Carol's son), stayed with her grandmother in Massachusetts.\n\nNickerson made appearances in the 1960s on such shows as \"The Doctors\" as Kate Harris, and opposite Bill Bixby in an unsold television pilot called \"Rome Sweet Rome\" on \"The New Phil Silvers Show\". Nickerson's big break came in 1968 when she joined the cast of ABC Daytime's \"Dark Shadows\", appearing as recurring characters Amy Jennings, Nora Collins, and Amy Collins from 1968–1970. Upon leaving \"Dark Shadows\", she appeared in the 1971 television movie \"The Neon Ceiling\".\n\nIn 1971, Nickerson, aged 13, was cast as the nymphet Lolita in the ill-fated musical, \"Lolita, My Love\" during its run in Boston, which closed on the road.

Its vision is to make London \"a world-class cycling city\". It is one of the largest urban cycling organisations in the world, with over 11,000 members.\n\nLCC was formed in 1978, through the merger of several London-based pro-cycling groups, some supported by Friends of the Earth. The organisation was officially founded on 28 September 1978 at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese public house on Fleet Street, and its first offices were at 40 James Street, London W1.\n\nThe organisation has grown steadily in membership and staffing over the years, and now employs 15 people to promote cycling, lobby government at all levels, and support its members. In 2006, the organisation became a charity to take advantage of more favourable tax conditions. Its head office is now located at Unit 201 Metropolitan Wharf, 70 Wapping Wall, London E1W 3SS.\n\nLCC is not allied to any political party, but works with other organisations and individuals campaigning for more enlightened use of public space in the capital — such as Living Streets, CTC, Sustrans and RoadPeace.\n\nThe majority of LCC's funding comes from membership subscriptions and charitable grants, although some of its staff are funded by local and regional government for the purposes of promoting cycling in London. For example, LCC administers grants for the Community Cycling Fund for London, which allocates money from Transport for London and the Big Lottery to promote local cycling groups. Since 2007, LCC has handed out over £1 million to such groups, and through this service has offered advice and support to hundreds of cyclists, often from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nLCC publishes a magazine for its 11,000 members, called the 'London Cyclist'. The publication was originally called the 'Daily Cyclist', the name being a light-hearted parody of British newspapers. The magazine serves to keep members in touch with the organisation's campaigns, and is also sent to many decision-makers in the capital.\n\nA number of independent cycling clubs affiliate to the London Cycling campaign which gives them the chance to support LCC's work and improve cycling for everyone in London, these clubs include London Clarion Cycle Club, London Dynamo and Islington Cycling Club. \n\nCurrent campaigns include:\n\n\nLCC campaigns are backed up by a network of local LCC member groups at the London borough level. Local LCC groups liaise with their local Borough Council, relevant Transport for London Streets Management section, Sustrans and other statutory and non-statutory authorities to comment on local plans and developments that affect cyclists, pedestrians and the local environment.\n\nThere is a local group for each London borough. Groups also organise cycle rides and other social events. \n\n\n"}

It is the third single and final track from the album.\n\nThe song was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the Grammy Awards of 2006, but lost to The Black Eyed Peas song \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". No music video was filmed for this song. Eminem, Dre and 50 Cent would later return to work together on the song \"Crack a Bottle\" from \"Relapse\". On \"Encore\", \"One Shot 2 Shot\" segues into the skit \"Final Thought\", which then segues into Encore, which also segues into the \"Curtains Down\" skit.\n\nAfter the song is over, \"Encore\" features a line by Eminem alerting listeners of Dr. Dre's upcoming album \"Detox\". Eminem tells his audience \"Don't worry about that \"Detox\" album. It's coming. We're gonna make Dre do it.\" In the song, Eminem hints at his career aspirations with the line, \"10 Multi-Platinum albums later three Diamond worldwide, we hit the charts with a bullet, and still climb.\" After \"Encore\", the next track on the album is a skit in which Eminem returns to the stage, stating that he forgot \"one more thing\", starts shooting at the crowd, and shoots himself through the mouth. The album's last lines are \"See you in hell, fuckers\" in a robotic voice, created by Eminem using an electrolarynx. Many critics thought that it might have meant Eminem will totally stop his music career. Others see it as him getting rid of his alter ego \"Slim Shady\", and coming back as a whole new rapper. Eminem had stated that, at that moment in time, he was not certain about the future but that he would still be involved in the music industry.\n\nThe edited version fades out before the shooting segment begins. It was later confirmed that the shooting was meant to represent the death of Slim Shady. Shady however returned in \"Relapse\", coming back after Eminem was released from a rehabilitation center. The skit was hinted in the earlier skit \"Em Calls Paul\", in which he tells his manager Paul Rosenberg through the phone that he has a good idea for the ending - \"I have this idea about how I want to end the show\" - in the same electrolarynx voice. In the skit, he also lies to Paul that he didn't get a new gun, referencing an earlier skit on the album where Paul hears rumours about him having a new gun as well as a skit on \"The Eminem Show\", where Paul was stressed over Eminem bringing his gun to the studio.\n\n\"HipHopDX\" praised the song: \"The best might be last [...] as Dre and 50 join Eminem for the title track and a surefire hit song.\" \"NME\" was negative: \"‘Encore/Curtains Down’ is the archetypal ‘gang’s all here’ show-closer, only with much more swearing and ‘the gang’ in this case being Dr Dre and 50 Cent, who are really the only two of Eminem's collaborators who deserve to share his applause. A round of applause which, by the way, hidden-significance-spotters, ends with Eminem blowing his brains out.\" RapReviews was positive: \"the album finally closes with a sure shot banger 'Encore/Curtains Down.' The Doctor lays the beat, Eminem drops the hook, and Eminem and Dre foray flames back and forth:\n\n[Dr. Dre] 'The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense itI don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches'\n\n[Eminem] 'We keep the party rockin' off the hingesWe ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus'\n\n[Dr. Dre] 'But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talkDoc is all washed up, knock it offWho the fuck is Doc impressin'?Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impressionYou must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the recordWe gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a secondThat's why we always save the best cut lastTo make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass'\"\n\n\"USA Today\" stated that Eminem \"closes out [...] trading lines with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre.\" \"The New York Times\", however, stated that the \"Em-and-Dre tag-team title track\" was not the \"most exciting thing\" on the album.\n"}

During his long and prolific career he published some 700 papers and two dozen books. His best known work is in electrochemistry but his output also extended to environmental chemistry, photoelectrochemistry and bioelectrochemistry. In the 1990s he experimented with cold fusion and transmutation, topics on which his unorthodox views provoked controversy.\n\nJohn Bockris was born on 5 January 1923, in Johannesburg, South Africa. His father was Alfred Bockris, and his mother Emmeline Mary MacNally. He attended a sequence of schools in Brighton, including the preparatory school Withdean Hall from 1934 to 1937, and Xaverian College, a Catholic secondary school, from 1937 to 1940. His father was not present during his childhood: His mother and aunt earned their income from tailoring.\n\nIn 1940 Bockris began his scholarly education at Brighton Technical College, which after World War II became Brighton University. Bockris wanted to study for a degree in Physics but this was not possible due to wartime staff shortages. Instead he took a two-year general degree in the natural sciences. In 1943, after a year of further study, he was accepted by Imperial College, London as a graduate student. He avoided conscription into the British armed forces due to his South African nationality.\n\nBockris relates that his supervisor, Harold Ellingham, provided minimal guidance and soon left the university altogether. Despite these obstacles, Bockris finished the research for his thesis, \"Electrochemistry of Non-aqueous Solutions,\" in two years, and received his doctorate in September 1945.\n\nUpon completion of his doctorate, at the age of 22, Bockris was immediately appointed to the faculty of Imperial College on the recommendation of Harry Emeléus. Over the course of the next eight years he supervised 28 graduate students with whom he co-authored a sufficient number of publications to qualify for his D.Sc., which he obtained in 1952. Among these students was Roger Parsons, a future fellow of the Royal Society, whom Bockris held in high regard.\n\nBockris moved to USA in 1953 to join the University of Pennsylvania as Professor of Chemistry, where he built a large and active research group. It was here that he published his best known work: the first model of the electrode-electrolyte surface to include the dipole moment of the solvent, and his two-volume textbook \"Modern Electrochemistry\" After 18 years in Philadelphia, however, departmental politics became such that Bockris felt the need to move. During next appointment, at Flinders University of South Australia from 1971 onwards, his interests broadened to include photoelectrochemistry and environmental chemistry. In 1979 Bockris made his final move to Texas A&M University where he remained until his retirement in 1997. In his later years his research focus veered further toward sources of energy and he embraced positions on some controversial topics that acquired a certain celebrity but damaged his professional reputation. \n\nElectrode kinetics remained a major component of his research program throughout. Bockris also conducted investigations of high temperature chemistry, the determinants of electrolyte solubility, and hydrogen/metal interactions.\n\nBockris was a prolific scholar, collaborator, and mentor. By the end of his career, he had authored, coauthored or edited more than 700 papers and two dozen books, and 85 students had obtained a Ph.D. degree with his supervision.\n\nIn 1970, Bockris, then a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said he had found a method for using sunlight to free hydrogen from water and coined the term \"hydrogen economy\" to describe the application of the anticipated technology. In 1975 he published a book on the subject. In 1982, at Texas A&M, he announced a \"quantum leap\" in his hydrogen-fuel technology through a \"secret catalyst\" that split water into hydrogen and oxygen even without the energy of sunlight. In 1984, he said he had found a material that facilitated complete conversion of sunlight to electricity. All of these \"discoveries\" were eventually attributed to basic errors in his research, although Bockris himself never acknowledged his mistakes.\n\nBockris performed a series of cold fusion experiments in the wake of the announcement in 1989 by Pons and Fleischmann that their electrolysis of heavy water had produced results consistent with nuclear fusion. Many groups attempted similar experiments: Bockris' research group was one of few to provide results that supported those of Pons and Fleischmann, reporting decisive evidence of tritium production. Their results were greeted with widespread skepticism. Gary Taubes wrote an editorial in Science suggesting that their cells might have been spiked with tritiated water. An academic tribunal at Texas A&M eventually ruled out fraud, declaring that intentionally spiked experiments gave different results. Bockris, seemingly inured to criticism, published his side of the controversy in a stubborn defense of academic freedom.\n\nThough his professional reputation declined after this episode, the International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Reactions \nhas continued to hold Bockris in high esteem, awarding him its Preparata Medal in 2012.\n\nIn 1993, Bockris claimed to be experimenting with the transmutation of elements, specifically of base metals into gold. The scientist received a degree of media attention for these extraordinary claims, to the extent that other academics at Texas A&M felt that the institution's reputation was suffering from the connection to the discredited \"science\" of alchemy. An editorial by Mike Epstein in the Journal of Scientific Exploration describes what happened next:\n\nEpstein's conclusion, however, was a defense of academic freedom:\n\nThe petition failed, and Dr. Bockris was eventually absolved by a four-professor panel of violating Texas A&M standards in proposing, conducting or reporting controversial research.\n\nIn 1997, Bockris was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in the field of Physics for his work in cold fusion and transmutation. The awardee declined to accept the trophy in person.\n\n\n\n"}

At that time, a doctoral thesis had to be defended outside of Latvia, so she defended hers in Minsk. This explains the fact that formally Taimiņa's doctorate was issued by the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. After Latvia regained independence in 1991, Taimiņa received her doctorate in mathematics from the University of Latvia, where she taught for 20 years.\n\nDaina Taimiņa joined the Cornell Math Department in December 1996.\n\nWhile attending a geometry workshop in 1997, she saw fragile paper models of hyperbolic planes, designed by geometer William Thurston. She decided to make more durable models, and did so by crocheting them. Due to her success in this she was invited, together with her husband David Henderson, a math professor also at Cornell, to give a presentation at a Cornell workshop.\nCrocheted mathematical models later appeared in three geometry textbooks they wrote together, of which the most popular is \"Experiencing Geometry: Euclidean and non-Euclidean with History\".\n\nAn article about Taimiņa's innovation in \"New Scientist\" was spotted by the Institute For Figuring, a small non-profit organisation based in Los Angeles, and she was invited to speak about hyperbolic space and its connections with nature to a general audience which included artists and movie producers. Taimiņa's initial lecture and following other public presentations sparked great interest in this new tactile way of exploring concepts of hyperbolic geometry, making this advanced topic accessible to wide audiences. Originally creating purely mathematical models, Taimiņa soon became popular as a fiber artist and public presenter for general audiences of ages five and up. In June 2005, her work was first shown as art in an exhibition \"Not The Knitting You Know\" at Eleven Eleven Sculpture Space, an art gallery in Washington, D.C. Since then she has participated regularly in various shows in galleries in US, UK, Latvia, Italy, Belgium, Ireland. Her artwork is in the collections of several private collectors, colleges and universities, and has been included in the American Mathematical Model Collection of the Smithsonian Museum, Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, and Institut Henri Poincaré.\n\nHer work has received wide interest in media. It has been written about in 'Knit Theory' in Discover magazine and in \"The Times\", explaining how a hyperbolic plane can be \"knitted\" by increasing the number of stitches:\n\nMargaret Wertheim interviewed Daina Taimiņa and David Henderson for Cabinet Magazine \nLater, the Institute For Figuring published a brochure \"A Field Guide to Hyperbolic Space\". In 2005 the IFF decided to incorporate Taimiņa's ideas and approach of explaining hyperbolic space in their mission of popularizing mathematics, and curated an exhibition at Machine Project gallery, which was the subject of a piece in the Los Angeles Times.\nTaimiņa's way of exploring hyperbolic space via crochet and connections with nature, combatting math phobia, was adapted by Margaret Wertheim in her talks and became highly successful in the IFF-curated Hyperbolic Crochet Coral Reef project.\n\nTaimiņa's book \"Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes\" (A K Peters, Ltd., 2009, ) won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.\nIt also won the 2012 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America.\n\nTaimiņa also contributed to David W. Henderson's book \"Differential Geometry: A Geometric Introduction\" (Prentice Hall, 1998) and, with Henderson, wrote \"Experiencing Geometry: Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History\" (Prentice Hall, 2005).\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the consort of \"amir\" Chupan (1319–1327), Il-Khan Arpa (r. 1335–36), and Il-Khan Suleiman (r. 1339–1343). In 1338–39, she was briefly the Ilkhanid \"khatun\" (queen regnant) during internal conflicts (and fragmentation), appointed by a Chobanid faction led by Hassan Kuchak.\n\nShe was born as daughter of Öljaitü and his Khongirad wife Eltuzmish Khatun. Upon her brother's accession in 1316, Sati Beg was betrothed to the \"amir\" Chupan, one of the most powerful individuals in the Ilkhanid court. They were wed on 6 September 1319; their marriage produced a son, Surgan. When Chupan and Abu Sa'id came into conflict in 1327, Sati Beg was returned to the Ilkhan. Chupan was executed that same year at Abu Sa'id's insistence; Sati Beg and Surgan were spared.\n\nFollowing Abu Sa'id's death in 1335, the Ilkhanate began to disintegrate. By 1336, Sati Beg and Surgan had taken the side of Arpa Ke'un, Sati Beg herself marrying him. However, after his death, they joined forces with the founder of the Jalayirid dynasty, Hasan Buzurg. After the latter seized control of western Persia, Surgan was made governor of Karabakh (in modern Azerbaijan), where he and his mother moved to. However, when a grandson of Chupan, Hasan Kucek, defeated Hasan Buzurg in July 1338, Sati Beg and Surgan defected to his camp. Taking advantage of her family ties, Hasan Kucek raised her to the Ilkhanid throne in July or August of that year. Her viziers were also from famous families in Iran. Her nominal authority did not extend beyond the Chobanid domains of northwestern Persia.\n\nHasan Buzurg, who still controlled southwestern Persia and Iraq, requested the assistance of another claimant of the Ilkhanid throne named Togha Temur. The latter invaded the Chobanid lands in early 1339. Hasan Kucek, however, promised Sati Beg's hand in marriage to him in exchange for an alliance. This proved, however, to be a ruse; the intent was merely to alienate Hasan Buzurg from Togha Temur. The Jalayirids withdrew their support, and Togha Temur was forced to retreat without gaining Sati Beg. Meanwhile, Hasan Kucek was growing suspicious of Sati Beg and her son. Realizing that she was too valuable to be removed completely, he deposed her and then forced her to marry his new candidate for the throne, Suleiman Khan.\n\nHasan Kucek was murdered late in 1343; Sati Beg's son Surgan found himself competing for control of the Chobanid lands with the late ruler's brother Malek Asraf and his uncle Yagi Basti. When he was defeated by Malek Asraf, he fled to his mother and stepfather. The three of them then formed an alliance, but when Hasan Buzurg decided to withdraw the support he promised, the plan fell apart, and they fled to Diyarbakr. Surgan was defeated again in 1345 by Malek Asraf and they fled to Anatolia. Coinage dating from 1342/1343 in Hesn Kayfa and Arzan (in Georgia) (dated 1345) in Sati Beg's name; this is the last trace of her. Surgan moved from Anatolia to Baghdad, where he was eventually executed by Hasan Buzurg; Sati Beg may have suffered the same fate, but this is unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "2272653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272653", "title": "Suit (album)", "text": "Suit (album)\n\nSuit is the fourth studio album by American rapper Nelly. It was intended to be released on August 17, 2004, before being delayed and released on September 13, 2004, by Universal Records. Production for the album was handled by several producers, including The Neptunes, Jazze Pha, Doe, AHM, Jayson \"Koko\" Bridges, Kuya Productions, Soulshock and Karlin, Ryan Bowser, Big Boi and Beat Bullies. Released in conjunction with \"Sweat\", Nelly intended to release a single album before conceptualizing and releasing two albums simultaneously, both of which would contrast each other's themes. Nelly characterized \"Sweat\" as \"more up-tempo\" and \"energetic\" while describing \"Suit\" as more of \"a grown-up and sexy vibe [...] it's more melodic\".\n\nThe album produced three singles: \"My Place\", \"Over and Over\" and \"'N' Dey Say\". Its lead single, \"My Place\", was a commercial success, topping the New Zealand, Australian and UK single charts, becoming Nelly's second number one on the former and latter charts. It peaked at number four on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Over and Over\" featuring country singer Tim McGraw was also a success, peaking at number three on the Hot 100, and topping several charts worldwide, including the Irish, Australian and UK Singles Charts. \"My Place\" and \"Over and Over\" were certified gold and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 and one million copies, respectively. \"Suit\" final single, \"'N' Dey Say\", achieved moderate chart success, peaking at number sixty-four on the Hot 100 and number six on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Suit\" was generally well received by music critics, who compared it with \"Sweat\", praising both album's contrasting themes and musical content, though with some criticism also targeted towards their content, in regards to inconsistencies. \"Suit\" topped the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart in its opening week, selling 396,000 copies, becoming Nelly's third consecutive US number-one album. It went on to be certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of three million copies. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards, losing to Kanye West's \"The College Dropout\".\n\nWhile recording material for his third studio album, Nelly had his intention of producing one album. Songs were being recorded at a steady pace, with Nelly composing more ideas, to which he established the idea of two albums released simultaneously to house all the tracks. On April 27, 2004, Nelly's representative initially described the upcoming albums as thematically dissimilar, \"one is more melodic and party-oriented in the vein of records like \"E.I.\" and \"Tip Drill\", while the other was described as having a \"harder edge\". Nelly would release singles accompanied by music videos from both albums. Talking to MTV News, Nelly went on to describe the differences between both albums; their titles of \"Sweat\" and \"Suit\" were announced on May 27, 2004. He noted \"Sweat\" as \"more up-tempo\" and \"energetic\", while characterizing \"Suit\" as more of \"a grown-up and sexy vibe [...] it's more melodic\".\n\n\"Sweat\" and \"Suit\" were intended to be released on August 17, 2004, but was pushed back and released on September 14 in the United States, Canada and Japan. \"Suit\" was released on September 13, 2004 in the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe lead single \"My Place\" interlopes composition from \"Isn't It a Shame\" by girl group Labelle and Randy DeBarge's 1982 \"I Like It\". It also samples elements of The Del-Vikings' 1957 soul ballad \"Come Go with Me\", which Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic recognized as a large influence to the song. Bordering between the genres of hip-hop and R&B, the song is primarily an \"adult-oriented Southern-tinged hip-hop love song,\" with guitars, synthesizers, and \"mixed high\" and \"mixed low\" beats. Other tracks that bare similar characteristics to \"My Place\" include \"Paradise\" (which also utilizes a \"finger-picked guitar\" throughout), \"Pretty Toes\" and \"She Don't Know My Name\". Birchmeier declared \"My Place\" as the successor to Nelly's 2002 \"Dilemma\". \"Over and Over\" is a break-up ballad, that combines Nelly’s sedate side with Tim McGraw’s \"twanging\" guitar and vocals, with McGraw providing an overdubbed hook. \"'N' Dey Say\" samples Spandau Ballet’s 1983 \"True\"; lyrically, the track and \"Paradise\" both engage in the themes of \"hope and the promise of something better\". \"Nobody Knows\" featuring Anthony Hamilton was chosen as the \"most sonically inventive track\" on \"Suit\" by Todd Burns of Stylus Magazine, who depicted its \"orchestral stabs\" and MIDI strings, which \"interweave uneasily\".\n\n\"My Place\" featuring Jaheim was released on July 20, 2004 as the album's lead single. It written by Nelly, Eldra DeBarge, Etterlene Jordan, Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff, Randy Edelman, William DeBarge, Jaheim Hoagland, Dorian Moore and produced by Doe. The song topped both the New Zealand and Australian singles charts, becoming Nelly's first number one on the former chart, and his second on the latter, following \"Dilemma\". \"My Place\" remained on the charts for fifteen and thirteen weeks, respectively. The song became his second number one on the UK Singles Chart on the week of September 11, 2004, again following \"Dilemma\". On the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, it peaked at number four. \"My Place\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Recorded Music NZ, for shipments of 500,000 and 7,500 units, respectively. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments of 70,000 copies.\n\n\"Over and Over\" featuring country singer Tim McGraw was released as the second single on October 12, 2004. It was written by Nelly, Jayson \"KoKo\" Bridges, James D. Hargrove and Samuel McGraw and produced by Bridges. The song achieved commercial success, topping several charts, including the Irish Singles Chart, Australian Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart. It is the second single from the album to top the latter and former charts, following \"My Place\". The song remained at number one in Australia for five consecutive weeks, and stayed atop in the UK for one week. \"Over and Over\" peaked within the top five on the New Zealand Singles Chart and the Hot 100, Nelly's second top five hit on the Hot 100 from the album . \"Over and Over\" was certified two times platinum by the ARIA, denoting shipments of 140,000 copies. The RIAA awarded the song with a single platinum certification, for shipments of one million copies.\n\n\"'N' Dey Say\" was released as the album's third and final single on May 23, 2005. The song was written by Nelly, Jayson Bridges and G. Kemp and produced by the former. It achieved its highest peak of number three on the Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders); it reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and number eight on the Belgian Singles Chart (Wallonia). The song reached the top twenty on the Irish Singles Chart, Finnish Singles Chart, New Zealand Singles Chart and Australian Singles Chart. \"'N' Dey Say\" peaked at number sixty-four on the Hot 100, achieving moderate chart success in other territories.\n\n\"Suit\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 62, based on 16 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Giving the album an A–, \"Entertainment Weekly\" David Browne lauded \"Suit\", writing that Nelly \"sounds convincing and appealing\" throughout the album. Browne went on to further praise specific songs including the \"summer-breezy\" \"Play it Off\" and the \"cozy hip-hop soul\" housed \"In My Life\". RapReviews.com's Steve Juon presented a similar response, giving the album a nine-out-of-ten rating. Juon depicted \"Suit\" as being more formal compared to \"Sweat\" which takes creative risks. He praised the overall material quality within both \"Suit\" and \"Sweat\", as well as their contrasting themes, going on to note the albums as \"one of the best double albums\" in hip-hop. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic was hesitant of the simultaneous release of two album's, as they may suffer from being one dimensional, but liked the musical content within both \"Suit\" and \"Sweat\", noting the former's to be more diversified. Birchmeier summed up \"Suit\" as \"a brief album with absolutely no filler\", describing its tracks as \"fun\" and \"catchy.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, Jason King of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that tracks on \"Suit\" have the \"sole intention of ending up as your next ringtone\". King noted some songs to \"crumble\" due to their \"simplistic approach\", while tracks like \"Flap Your Wings\" as \"addictive\". Stylus Magazine's Todd Burns praised several tracks on \"Suit\", including \"Over and Over\" and \"Nobody Knows\", praising the former for combining Nelly's sedate side with Tim McGraw’s guitar and vocals. Despite this, Burns saw the album's highlights as \"minimal at best\", and closed his review disapproving of the album's mainstream approach. In a negative review, \"The Guardian\" \nAlexis Petridis showed distaste for both Nelly's vocal technique and \"Suit\" tracks. Petridis described the album's songs as \"gummy R&B ballads\", while noting Nelly's egotism to overtake his abilities as an artist. \"Suit\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards, losing to Kanye West's \"The College Dropout\".\n\nIn its opening week, \"Suit\" debuted atop the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 396,000 copies, becoming Nelly's third consecutive US number-one album following \"Country Grammar\" (2000) and \"Nellyville\" (2002). On the same week of \"Suit\" release, Nelly's \"Sweat\", released in conjunction with the former album, debuted at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 342,000 copies. The combination of both album's opening figures of 737,000 surpasses that of \"Nellyville\", which debuted with 714,000 copies sold. With the debuts, Nelly became the first act to achieve the feat of obtaining album's number one and number 2 on the US Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart simultaneously. He is the second artist, following American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, to achieve the same feat but on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Guns N' Roses attained the accomplishment in 1991 with \"Use Your Illusion II\" and \"Use Your Illusion I\", with the former debuting at number one and the latter at number 2, selling 770,000 and 685,000 copies, respectively. The following week of \"Suit\" release, it fell to number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 160,000 copies, being replaced by Green Day's \"American Idiot\" (2004). In its third week, \"Suit\" sold 118,000 copies, dropping to number 5. In the album's fourth week of release, its sales increased to 122,000 copies, the only album of the week to have its sales rise; it sustained its position at number 5. In its fifth week, \"Suit\" sales further increased to 144,000 units, gaining the title of Greatest Gainer, and rising from number 5 to number 3 on the chart. The album's sales continued to increase in its sixth week of release, selling 153,000 copies, moving from number 3 to number 2. It had passed one million copies in sales in the US that week. On November 1, 2004, \"Suit\" went on to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 500,000 copies. On January 19, 2005, the album was certified three times platinum by the RIAA, for shipments of three million copies.\n\nOn the Canadian Albums Chart, \"Suit\" debuted at number one, becoming Nelly's first album to top the chart in the country. The album debuted at number 6 on the New Zealand Albums Chart on the week of September 20, 2004, remaining at number 6 for two weeks, and dropping out of the chart after thirteen weeks. On the Australian Albums Chart, \"Suit\" reached at number 7, remaining on the chart for five weeks. Along with \"Sweat\", \"Suit\" is Nelly's third consecutive album to peak within the top ten of the latter three charts. The album has been certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and Recorded Music NZ, for shipments of 35,000 and 7,500 copies, respectively. The album reached the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and German Albums Chart, at number 8. It has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for shipments of 300,000 copies, on May 20, 2005. \"Suit\" peaked at number 11 on the Swiss Albums Chart on the week of September 26, 2004, dropping off the chart after eight weeks. It remained on the Dutch Albums Chart for seven weeks, debuting and peaking at number 17. The album was less successful in other territories, charting within the top thirty on the Austrian Albums Chart and Norwegian Albums Chart at number 29. \"Suit\" reached at number 34 on the Swedish Albums Chart, number 43 on the Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders) and number 72 on the French Albums Chart. The album's lowest charting position was on the Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia), at number 83. It remained on it for three weeks.\n\nNotes\n\nCredits adapted from Allmusic.\n\n\n\n"}

They produce award winning drama and entertainment shows for the international market including \"Hollyoaks\", \"The Only Way is Essex\", \"Geordie Shore\" and \"Free Rein\". \n\nThe company's first major production was the soap opera \"Brookside\" for Channel 4, which ran from the channel's foundation in 1982 until 2003, when it was taken off air due to declining ratings. A 3-part spin-off ('soap bubble') of \"Brookside\" was produced in November 1987 called \"Damon and Debbie\".\n\nIn 1995, the company began producing a second soap opera for Channel 4, \"Hollyoaks\", which still runs.\n\nBoth \"Brookside\" and \"Hollyoaks\" were created by Redmond himself, and in 2003 the company took over production of another series he had created, the children's drama \"Grange Hill\", which had first been broadcast on BBC1 in 1978 and had been made in-house by the BBC until Mersey Television took over.\n\nThe company moved production of the series to their Liverpool base, with the fictional school no longer being established as in London but instead an unspecified UK location.\n\nIn 1991 Mersey Television under the name of North West Television made an audacious bid during the ITV \nto takeover television right in the North West England from holders Granada Television. Granada had held the North West franchise ever since the inception of independent television in the 1950s, and Granada was one of the biggest and the most established of the ITV companies. Granada was also a popular production company and it came second only to the BBC to find the most respected British television company amongst the British public.\n\nThe bid was supported financially by Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television and the bid had aimed to provide a more balanced television service for the North West, in particular featuring more content from Liverpool as opposed to Manchester. However, although North West Television bid more money for the franchise totalling £35 million as opposed to Granada's £9 million, the licence stayed with Granada as the Independent Television Commission declared that the Mersey Television bid did not meet the required quality threshold.\n\nFurthermore, Granada were aware of Mersey Television's attempts to gain the North West franchise and built defences to avoid the loss of the licence they had owned for many years. New franchises which had no experience of owning an ITV franchise (Mersey Television was one such example) would have to a pass a \"quality hurdle\" that Granada executives actually helped the ITC adopt. Granada also had a well known catalogue of productions including \"Prime Suspect\", \"Cracker\", \"World in Action\" and \"Coronation Street\" and if Mersey Television had gained the franchise, then Granada would have sold these to satellite television, but it never happened.\n\nMersey Television was bought by All3Media in June 2005 and, in a contractual requirement, renamed \"Lime Pictures\" in 2006. Since then the company has produced the following series:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2272667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272667", "title": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Indiana", "text": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Indiana\n\nThe Diocese of Lafayette in Indiana () was established by Pope Pius XII on October 21, 1944, from the territory of the Diocese of Fort Wayne. At that time, there were 54 parishes. The diocese contained approximately 31,700 Roman Catholics at its inception.\n\nBishop William Leo Higi presided over the diocese from June 6, 1984, until March 12, 2010, when the Holy See announced his successor, Timothy L. Doherty, then a priest of the Diocese of Rockford. Doherty was consecrated bishop of the diocese on July 15, 2010, and has presided over it since, becoming its sixth Ordinary.\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Indiana began with the Diocese of Vincennes which was created in 1834 by Pope Gregory XVI. It was in this diocese that many French missionaries came to this very anti-Catholic area. The most notable of these missionaries was Theodore Guerin who made her way to southern Indiana with her Sisters of Providence in 1841. Guerin and others in the Sisters formed St. Mary of the Woods College at Terre Haute, Indiana with many alumni throughout the state to preach and spread the Church. From the 1840s to the early 20th century many different parishes were built throughout the area along with Catholic schools which not only broadened the spread of Catholicism, but also created the need for a new diocese. In the late 19th century, the Holy See formed the Diocese of Fort Wayne, separate from the Diocese of Vincennes. The area that was to eventually become Lafayette was at that time part of this new See added to Indiana.\n\nAfter many years in the Vincennes dioceses, and later in the Fort Wayne Diocese, the area of north central began to grow in Catholicism and it became apparent that a new diocese was to be formed. On January 18, 1945, Bishop John George Bennett was consecrated the first bishop of the newly formed Diocese of Lafayette. Bishop Bennett encouraged Catholics of the area to go out and actively help to develop this new diocese. In 1957, Bishop Bennett died while remaining in charge of the Lafayette Diocese. It was announced before his death, while he was ill, that the successor to Bennett would be Bishop John Joseph Carberry.\n\nBishop Carberry continued the work of his predecessor in the growth of the Diocese, while maintaining his own style of leadership. On March 15, 1964, Bishop Carberry announced that a census would be held on November 15. The census found that the diocese had 73,822 Catholics and signified a move from mostly rural populations to scattered suburban areas. On January 20, 1965, it was announced that Bishop Carberry would be transferred to the Diocese of Columbus (later on, Bishop Carberry would be Archbishop of St. Louis and be appointed a Cardinal).\n\nIn August 1965, Raymond Joseph Gallagher was appointed as the next bishop. Bishop Gallagher not only attended the final sessions of the Second Vatican Council but made sure that new parishes were being erected where the growth of Catholic's were the greatest. Within the first five years of being Bishop, Gallagher dedicated many churches in northern Indiana. Bishop Gallagher was part of the Catholic Church during a time when social issues such as birth control were at their height. In 1968 Pope Paul VI issued an encyclical letter forbidding artificial birth control. Throughout the reign, the Diocese grew, and Bishop Gallagher became very successful in his mission.\n\nWith Gallagher's retirement in 1982, Bishop George Avis Fulcher was appointed by Pope John Paul II. Within three weeks of his installation as Bishop, he was appointed to the US Bishops' Committee for the implementation of the Pastoral Letter on Peace. While driving to a conference on Canon Law in January 1984, Bishop Fulcher died when his car crashed off US-41 at Gobbler's Knob north of Rockville. With the sudden death, the Diocese was left in shock and would not have another Bishop appointed until April of that year.\n\nWilliam Leo Higi was chosen by John Paul II to succeed Fulcher and was installed on June 6, 1984.\n\nDuring Bishop Higi's reign, he not only expanded the Diocese by dedicating new churches, but also added the second high school to the diocese, St. Theodore Guerin High School in Noblesville. In addition to working within the diocese, he also made connections to Haiti with many outreaches the third-world country. After over twenty-six years as head of the diocese, Bishop Higi retired in May 2010.\n\nIt was announced that Timothy Doherty would succeed Higi as the sixth bishop of the diocese. Bishop Doherty was consecrated bishop of the diocese on July 15, 2010, becoming the sixth and current bishop of the See of Lafayette.\n\n\nFrom its beginning in 1944, the patron of Lafayette Diocese has been the Immaculate Conception because the seat of the diocese, The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Lafayette shares the namesake. The feast day for the Immaculate Conception is on December 8. It was in the early first decade of the 21st century that the diocese began contemplating adding another patron. With the formation of St. Theodore Guerin High School in Noblesville in 2004, Guerin was officially named another patron of the Diocese of Lafayette.\n\n\n\n\nThe Diocese of Lafayette publishes a weekly newspaper, \"The Catholic Moment\", which was established on January 21, 1945. Its circulation is about 28,000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2272668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272668", "title": "Sringeri Sharada Peetham", "text": "Sringeri Sharada Peetham\n\nThe Sringeri Peetham is one of the major Hindu monastic institutions that has historically coordinated Smarta tradition and monastic activities through satellite institutions in South India, preserved Sanskrit literature and pursued Advaita studies. It is one of the centers of the Dashnami monastic order. The Sringeri Peetham has been a library and a source of historic Sanskrit manuscripts. Along with other Hindu monasteries, the contemporary Sringeri matha has been active in preserving the Vedas, sponsoring students and recitals, Sanskrit scholarship, and celebrating annual Adishankaracharya jayanti usually in May, Guru Purnima (Vayasa Purnima) usually in april.\n\nThe Sringeri Sharada Peetham, also called Sringeri Pitham or Sringeri Matha, is about east of Udupi and northeast from Mangaluru across the Western Ghats, and about west-northwest from the state capital, Bengaluru. In historical texts, Sringeri is also referred to as Risyasringagiri of the Ramayana fame, whose legend is also recited in the Mahabharata.\n\nAdi Shankara is traditionally believed to have established four Advaita monasteries on the Indian subcontinent. These were the Dwarka monastery in Gujarat to coordinate religious studies in the west, Badari in Uttarakhand for the north (Jyotirmatha), Jagannatha Puri in Odisha for the east (Govardhana), and Sringeri Sharada in Karnataka for the south. He also began the tradition of appointing independent leading \"gurus\" for each of the four monasteries and their succession planning by naming sri Hastamalakacharya to head Dwaraka, Totakacharya to head Badari, sri Padmapadacharya to lead Puri and Sureshwaracharya to lead Sringeri. \n\nA hagiographic legend states that Adi Shankara envisioned this place as the holy site where a snake unveiled his hood like an umbrella to protect a frog from the hot sun. According to tradition, the Sringeri matha is one of four major temples site established by Sankara. As per Hindu legend, the place is associated with sage Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandankamuni. Beyond such legends, Adi Shankara (8th-century) is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smartha tradition of Hinduism. Shankara taught the nondualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived Advaita Vedanta tradition.\n\nSureshwaracharya, believed to be the same as Maṇḍana Miśra, was installed as the successor of Shankaracharya before the latter resumed his tour to found his three pithas at Puri, Dwaraka and Badarinath. The math holds one of the four Mahavaakyas, \"Aham-Bramhasmi.\" The math has a lineage of Jagadgurus, stretching back straight to Sri Adi Shankaracharya himself. The present and 36th Jagadguru acharya of this peetham is Jagadguru Bharathi Teertha Mahaswami. His guru was Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswami. The successor-designate (the 37th Jagadguru acharya) was appointed in 2015, and was given the Yogapatta (monastic name) Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Mahaswami.\n\nThe history of Sringeri Peetham from the time of Adi Shankara to about the 14th-century is unclear, in part because the sources are contradictory about the dates and events, in part because of the loss of records, and also because the pontiffs of the monastery adopted the same name which has created confusion in understanding the surviving records. The early inscriptions that mention Sringeri, all in Nagari script and the regional Kannada language, are donative or commemorative. Though useful in establishing the significance of the matha, they lack details to help establish the early history. According to Hermann Kulke, the early history of Sringeri is unknown and the earliest epigraphical evidence in the region is from the 12th-century and belongs to the Jainism tradition.\n\nThe history of Sringeri Peetha after the 13th-century, in the Vijayanagara Empire era is found in the matha's literature as well as in \"kadatas\" (ledger records and inscriptions of various forms) and \"sanads\" (charters).\n\nA Sringeri monk and scholar named Vidyaranya (sometimes referred to as Madhava Vidyaranya, or Madhavacharya) was an ideological support and the intellectual inspiration for the founders of the Vijayanagara Empire. He helped Harihara I and his brother Bukka to build a Hindu army to overthrow the Muslim rule in the Deccan region, and re-establish a powerful Hindu kingdom from Hampi. In his counsel, the Vijayanagara founders lead an expansive liberation of much of the southern Indian peninsula from the Sultanates that had formed after several invasions by the Delhi Sultanate. The monk's efforts were supported by the 10th and 11th pontiff of Sringeri peetham. Vidyaranya later became the 12th pontiff of the Sringeri peetham in 1375 CE. Shortly after the start of the Vijayanagara empire in 1336 CE, the rulers began building the Vidyashankara temple at the Sringeri peetham site. This temple was completed in 1338. The Vijayanagara rulers repaired and built numerous more Hindu and Jain temples in and around the Sringeri matha and elsewhere in their empire. This is a period where numerous inscriptions help establish the significance of the Sringeri peetham from the 14th-century onwards.\n\nThe Vijayanagara rulers Harihara and Bukka gave a \"sarvamanya\" (tax-exempt) gift of land in and around Sringeri in 1346 CE to the Sringeri matha guru Bharati Tirtha, in a manner common in the Indian tradition for centuries, to help defray the costs of operating the monastery and temples. The grant is evidenced by a stone inscription by the king who reverentially refers to the 10th pontiff of Sringeri matha as a \"guru\" (counsellor, teacher). This grant became a six-century tradition that ended in the 1960s and 1970s when the Indian central government introduced and enforced a land-reform law that redistributed the land. The Vijayanagara empire gift also began a regional philanthropic tradition of endowments by the wealthy and the elderly population to the Sringeri matha. The \"matha\" managed the land and therefore operated as a sociopolitical network and land-grant institution for over 600 years beyond its religious role and spiritual scholarship. This relationship between the monastery and the regional population has been guided by a mutual \"upcara\" (hospitality, appropriate conduct) guideline between the \"matha\" and the populace. According to Leela Prasad, this \"upcara\" has been guided by the Hindu Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras texts preserved and interpreted by the \"matha\", one composed by a range of authors and generally dated to be from the second half of the 1st-millennium BCE through about 400 CE.\n\nThe Vijayanagara kings visited the Sringeri monastery many times over some 200 years and left inscriptions praising the monks, revering their knowledge of the Vedas and their scholarship. The monastery also provided the Vijayanagara empire administration with guidance on governance. The descendant rulers of the Vijayanagara empire regularly visited the monastery and made a series of endowments to the Sringeri matha as evidenced by various inscriptions. They also established the \"agrahara\" of Vidyaranyapuram with a land grant for the Brahmins, and in 15th-century established the earliest version of the Saradamba temple found at the Sringeri peetham site. The tradition of establishing satellite institutions under the supervision of the Sringeri peetham started in the Vijayanagara empire period. For example, Vidyaranya organized a \"matha\" in Hampi.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Vijayanagara empire and the destruction of Hampi by a coalition of Deccan sultanates, the Vijayanagara empire territories faced a political turmoil. The Deccan region was largely divided among five Islamic sultanates. The coastal regions of Karnataka that included the Sringiri matha ultimately came under the control of the Nayakas of Keladi from the Lingayatism tradition, who has previously served as governors for the Vijayanagara emperors. The Keladi dynasty supported the Sringiri peetham for nearly 250 years, from 1499 to 1763, when the Keladi Nayakas rule was ended by Hyder Ali seeking to create a sultanate from Mysore.\n\nThe Sringeri matha received gifts and grants from the Keladi Nayakas, as evidenced by ledger records and literature preserved by the monastery. Unlike the copious epigraphical evidence from the Vijayanagara era, few inscriptions from the Keladi era history are available and the history of this period is mostly discernible from the literary records. The lands held by the monastery and the goods meant for its operation were treated by the Nayakas as tax-exempt and not subject to any tariffs. Additionally, the 17th-century records show that the matha received special gifts from the Lingayat rulers on festive occasions such as \"acharavicharas\" and Diwali. Some of the Nayaka princes studied at a school run by the monastery.\n\nThe Sringeri matha was supported by the Maratha rulers when they came to power in the post-Aurangzeb Mughal era. The monastery provided the Marathas with counsel in return as evidenced by over two dozen letters, mostly in the Marathi language and some in Sanskrit using Kannada script. These have been preserved by the monastery. According to the letters and ledger entries, the Maratha rulers delivered gifts and bestowed grants to the monastery between 1738 and 1894. The letters of the Maratha rulers are typically in Marathi, while the replies from the Sringeri pontiff are in Sanskrit. In addition to these records, the monastery literature mention land grants from the Marathas as well as records of the visit by the \"jagadguru\" (pontiff) to Maratha ruled regions and towns such as Pune and Nasik.\n\nThe religio-political significance of the Sringeri monastery was such that both the Marathas and the Muslim ruler Hyder Ali sought \"cordial relations\" with it. According to Leela Prasad, after the Maratha ruler Raghunatha Rao invited the Sringeri matha's Jagadguru to visit him and the pontiff accepted the invitation, when Hyder Ali – whose hostility to the Marathas had been legendary – heard about the trip, Hyder Ali sent the Jagadguru gifts and an escort consisting of a palanquin, five horses, an elephant and cash for the travel expenses.\n\nAfter the third Anglo-Mysore war in 1791 between the armies of the British and Marathas coalition and those of Tipu Sultan, a part of the defeated contingent of the Marathas, called the Pindaris, returned through Sringeri. They looted the monastery temples of its gold and copper, statues, killed some Brahmin priests, and destroyed property. The news reached Tipu Sultan, who sent funds to restore the damage. Tipu Sultan, a Muslim, also sent a letter requesting the Jagadguru to perform penance and Hindu worship for \"good showers and crops\". Scholars have interpreted this event both as an evidence of Tipu Sultan's religious tolerance and the predatory habits of some contingents in the Maratha army, or alternatively as a strategic political move by Tipu Sultan to request the monastery to perform \"superstitious rites\" to \"conciliate with his Hindu subjects and to discomfort his Maratha enemies\", quotes Leela Prasad.\n\nThe Pindari sacking led to a protest by the pontiff of the Sringeri matha who started a fast to death on the banks of the Tunga river. According to Shastri, after the Maratha Peshwa ruler learned about the Pindari sacking, he took corrective action and sent his contingents to locate the loot, the statues, gold and copper, to return it along with compensation. In the years and decades that followed the Pindari sacking of 1791, the cordial relations and mutual support between the Sringeri monastery and the Maratha rulers returned.\n\nThe Sringeri monastery has been a historic politico-religious center at least from the 14th-century. Along with the Vijayanagara emperors and the Mysore Muslim rulers such as Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, the colonial British authorities and their Nayak and Wodeyar dynasty appointees considered the monastery to be a strategically important hub for regional politics. Its operations were a target of surveillance, its collection of Hindu texts on Dharma and its counsel given its regional significance were sought by the British authorities.\n\nThe Sringeri matha includes two major temples. One is dedicated to Shiva and is called the Vidya Shankara temple, the other to Saraswati and is called the Sharada Amba temple. The earliest version of the Shiva temple was built in the 14th-century, of goddess Saraswati in the 15th-century.\n\nThe Vidyashankara temple is a fusion of pre-Vijayanagara Hindu temple architecture traditions with Hoysalas and Vijayanagara styles, giving it an unusual appearance. The temple has an apsidal shape with its interior chambers and sanctum set on the square principle while the spire and outer walls use an almost circular plan. The temple is set on a high plinth like the Hoysala temples, with the basement adorned with sculpted animals and balustrades with yalis flanking the steps. The outer walls of the Shiva temple have large sculptured panels at right angles to each other and these show the major gods and goddess of Vedic tradition and post-Vedic Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Saurism (Surya) and Ganapatya (Ganesha) traditions of Hinduism. The base of the temple have relief friezes depicting a large variety of stories from Hindu epics and puranas. The sanctum has a linga, the southern side of the sanctum features Brahma-Sarawati, the western side Vishnu-Lakshmi, and the northern side Shiva-Parvati.\n\nThe temple can be entered from four directions. Inside the temple is a large mandapa with intricately carved pillars, several antechambers with artwork, a sanctum with linga and a circumambulation passageway around it. The passageway opens to smaller shrines dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses from various Hindu traditions. According to George Michell, the current Vidyashankara temple reflects the 16th-century additions.\n\nSaraswati, the goddess of knowledge and arts in the Hindu tradition, is the presiding deity of the monastery. The monastery tradition states that Adi Shankara installed a sandalwood image of Saraswati as Saradamba in a simple shrine, one that was replaced with its current copy in gold during the Vijayanagara era. The shrine was rebuilt in the 15th-century and expanded in early 20th-century. The temple has a maha-mandapa (main hall) with images of \"saptamatrikas\" (seven mothers) sculpted by Tamil artists in the Tamil style. The goddess sits in a golden chariot. Along with Saraswati in the sanctum, the temple has small shrines for Ganesha and for Bhuvaneshvari. The Saradambda temple and nearby structures additionally house a library, a Vedic school, a shrine for Adi Shankara, and other facilities of the monastery. It has been the historic epicenter of Sringeri's annual Navaratri festival celebrations, as well as the chariot festival held in February or March every year. The temple also gives the site its name, with \"Sarada peetha\" meaning \"seat of learning\". The temple was renovated to its current form in 1916.\n\nSringeri matha has preserved and been a source of ancient Sanskrit manuscripts to scholars. In the contemporary monastery, a library is located on the first floor of the Saradamba temple. It has about 500 palm-leaf manuscripts and a large collection of paper manuscripts, most of which are in Sanskrit. These manuscripts are not only related to Advaita philosophy, but to classical subjects such as Sanskrit grammar, \"Dharmasutras\", ethics, and arts.\n\nThe Sringeri Sharada Peetham, over its 1200 years of operations has evolved a structure to manage the monastery, its succession and its branches. Some of the key positions and features include:\n\nThe Sringeri Sharada Peetham has a network of branches in India. Some of the major branches include those in Varanasi, Haridwar, Nasik, Gaya, Mysore, Hyderbad, Madurai, Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tirupati, Coimbatore, Ramesvaram, Kalady, Ramnad and Bengaluru. The monastery also supervises a number of Vedic studies and Sanskrit schools in various parts of India. The monastery owns some agriculture land and this is farmed by the monks and monastery workers.\n\nJagadguru Vidhushekara Bharathi was appointed as Uttaradhikari of the Sringeri Sharadha Peetham by Jagadguru Bharathi Teertha Mahaswami on 23 January 2015. The last five \"Jagadgurus\" were:\n\n\n\n"}

He was born at a farm near Housatonic, and suffered severe illness. For a time this illness Attendance at school in his father's house for a few months, and in the village for four months at the age of fourteen, gave him all the common-school education he received.\n\nFor a time, failure in his eyesight seemed to bar him from further education; however in 1791, after stints in local boarding schools, he matriculated at Yale University. Near the end of his first semester, he was elected member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He graduated in 1793.\n\nIn 1796 Yale President Dwight proposed to nominate him as a tutor, but he had already been admitted to the Bar, and declined the offer. He opened an office in his native town. He practiced in Litchfield and Fairfield counties. After thirty-six years, he was appointed for five successive years Chief Judge of the County Court for Litchfield County, before he was displaced for political reasons. He was made Judge of Probate for the district of New Milford in 1805, and held the place by successive annual appointments for sixteen years. He was Justice of the Peace for thirty-two years. He was elected Representative to the General Assembly eight times. In 1808, he was elected a member of the Connecticut Society of Arts and Sciences, and was Vice-President of the Connecticut Historical Society from its first establishment.\n\nHe married May 18, 1806, Charlotte Taylor, the daughter of Nathaniel Taylor, Esq., and they had seven children.

A local party of Jeffersonians was early organized in New Milford and supported by two of his brothers, but this circumstance did not abate the form of his allegiance to federalist principles, nor on the other hand did it weaken the tenderness of his fraternal love.\n\nHenry Clay and Daniel Webster were the objects of his profoundest admiration. He rarely wrote for publication. He contributed however a few papers of great value for the newspapers, and for the New Englander of November, 1858, a review of Mr. J. C.

(stylized as fox21 television studios., formerly known as Fox Television Studios) is an American television production company that is a subsidiary of Disney Media Networks' Walt Disney Television owned by The Walt Disney Company.\n\nFox Television Studios (FTVS) was formed in 1997 alongside its existing fellow corporate units, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Twentieth Television under executive David Grant. The studio was designed to house smaller production units, starting with the Greenblatt-Janollari Studio (G-JS). Greenblatt-Janollari started producing shows in the 1998-1999 season with 3 comedy series for ABC and CBS. While funded by Fox, G-JS was presented as an \"independent mini-studio\". With Fox Entertainment Group holding a 20% stake in New Regency Production's parent corporation, Fox Studios formed a joint venture, Regency Television, by 2000, managed by Gail Berman. Another production unit formed was Fox Television Studios Productions (FTSP) under Lisa Berger. Early output by the individual units, or \"pods\" were FTSP's \"Son of the Beach\" for FX, \"The Hughleys\" by G-JS and Regency had \"Malcolm in the Middle\".\n\nThe pod model faded into five divisions: alternative, scripted, international, Fox World and Regency TV. The alternative division was responsible for \"Talkshow with Spike Feresten\" and \"The Wanda Sykes Show\", along with E!'s \"The Girls Next Door\" franchise. The scripted division produced \"The Shield\", along with a number of television films and miniseries.\n\nFox World division had acquired rights to \"The Coach\" in early 2002 from France’s TF1 and its Quai Sud production entity. In mid-2002, Fox Alternative Productions was formed by Fox TV Studios and headed by David Martin with its first show to be \"The Coach\".\n\nAfter a while, the only division operating was the scripted unit. Next FTVS attempted international co-productions of direct-to-series broadcast series. The company had a hit with \"Burn Notice\" on USA Network. In August 2010, Dave Madden was appointed to head the unit, where he evenly increased its production slates until he was appointed as president of entertainment for Fox Broadcasting in August 2014.\n\nFox 21 was formed in 2004 by 20th Century Fox Television executives Dana Walden and Gary Newman to develop and back smaller-budgeted but unique and daring shows. Fox 21's first executive was Jane Leisner. The unit's early hits were the FX series \"Sons of Anarchy\" and The CW reality series \"Beauty and the Geek\".\n\nThe studio also co-produced The Muppets' Wizard of Oz with Touchstone Television, The Jim Henson Company and The Muppets Studio.\n\nAfter originally being passed over for programming the new network, MyNetworkTV, Fox 21 was in consideration along with Twentieth Television and independent producers as of December 2006 in a potential reprogramming from telenovela to low-cost reality and game shows.\n\nBert Salke, who moved from his Brancato/Salke production company based at ABC Studios, took charge of the unit in 2010 and led an increase in show productions starting with the Showtime series \"Homeland\". In early 2015, Mythology Entertainment signed a first look deal with the company and its sister studio 20th Century Fox Television while announcing the head of its TV division.\n\nThe company produces or had produced the USA Network series \"Rush\", the FX series \"Terriers\", \"Tyrant\" and \"The Bastard Executioner\", the A&E action series \"Breakout Kings\", the Comedy Central series \"Brickleberry\", the WGN America series \"Salem\", the TNT series \"Legends\" and the Lifetime series \"Witches of East End\".\n\nIt was announced in December 2014 that Fox 21 and Fox Television Studios would merge into Fox 21 Television Studios. This situation came as a result of FTVS' president David Madden being promoted to Fox Broadcasting Company and the fact that both units were focusing on the same market, cable TV. The combined operation is headed by Fox 21 president Bert Salke.\n\nFox 21 signed Okay Goodnight production company to multi-year first-look agreement in January 2020 starting with \"The Dreamers\" novel adaptation together with The Littlefield Company.

{"id": "2272710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272710", "title": "Rust v. Sullivan", "text": "Rust v. Sullivan\n\nRust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), was a case in the United States Supreme Court that upheld Department of Health and Human Services regulations prohibiting employees in federally funded family-planning facilities from counseling a patient on abortion. This ruling was made after the Department issued a regulation in 1988 expanding its interpretation of the Title X provision that no family planning funds \"shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\"\n\nMany physicians and clinics challenged the regulation, arguing that it violated their First Amendment right to free speech and the right of women to seek an abortion under \"Roe v. Wade\". The case reached the Supreme Court, where a 5–4 verdict allowed the regulation to go into effect, holding that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the Public Health Service Act, and that the First Amendment is not violated when the government merely chooses to \"fund one activity to the exclusion of another.\"\n\nThere were several arguments for why the supreme court case could have violated the First Amendment. The argument used in defense of the government not violating the First Amendment and not staying neutral was coined \"government speech\" The argument was that when the government decided to not fund Planned Parenthood facilities which engaged in abortions, it was participating in \"government speech\" which means they were speaking on its own behalf and simply holding the views of those who elected them, not regulating private speech.\n\nThe case concerned the legality and constitutionality of Department of Health and Human Services regulations on the use of funds spent by the U.S. federal government to promote family planning (Title X). With Title X of the Public Health Service Act, Congress prohibited the funds from being \"used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\" In 1988, the Republican-appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that prohibited projects receiving these funds from not only providing abortions, but also counseling, advising, or promoting the idea that a woman seek an abortion. These regulations were challenged on the grounds that they were not permissibly within the scope of the statute and that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments. In Rust v. Sullivan (1991), the petitioners stated that they had experienced an infringement of their First Amendment constitutional rights, as grantees of federal funds for family-planning services under Title X of the Public Health Service Act (the \"Act\"). Under Section 1008 of the Act, the grantees are prohibited from using any of the funds for family-planning services related to abortion. Further compliance by the Act requires the grantees to provide written policies to their sub-recipients on the prohibition of the funds for any abortion-related services. Planned Parenthood and the state and city of New York sued on the grounds that not receiving government funding meant that abortions in turn would not be funded.\n\nRust v. Sullivan began on the issue of abortion counseling. In February 1988, the Reagan administration added regulations that focused specifically on discussing abortion practices. Planned Parenthood and the state and city of New York said that these regulations infringed on doctors’ First Amendment rights, interfered with a woman's privacy right when it comes to abortion, and prevented a woman from being able to hear competent and sound medical advice. Arguers protested that if a facility receives government funding, it does not mean that the government can regulate the services in that facility. For example, a library that receives funds through the Library Services and Construction Act does not permit the Federal Government to say that the books in that library can or cannot have certain books. Additionally, universities that receive Federal funds do not have their curriculum dictated by the Federal Government.\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter. The court ruled that \"a doctor employed by the project may be prohibited in the course of his project duties from counseling abortion or referring for abortion. This is not a case of the government suppressing a dangerous idea, but of a prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of its scope.\" The court found that \"Title X of the Public Health Service Act of 1970 may be read to bar not only abortions but also abortion counseling.\" Rehnquist wrote for the majority in finding that the regulations were based upon a permissible interpretation of the statute under the \"Chevron\" test, that they did not violate First Amendment free speech rights, and that they did not violate the right of women to terminate a pregnancy as established in \"Roe v. Wade\" under the Fifth Amendment substantive due process doctrine.\n\nIn the dissenting opinion, Justice Blackmun said \"the Court for the first time upholds viewpoint-based suppression of speech, solely because it is imposed on those dependent upon the government for economic support. I conclude that the Secretary’s regulation of referral, advocacy and counseling activities exceeds his statutory authority, and also that the regulations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of our Constitution.\" Justices Marshall, Stevens, and O’Connor joined Blackmun's dissenting opinion. Stevens wrote separately that \"not a word in the statute...authorizes the (HHS) Secretary to impose any restrictions on the dissemination of truthful information or professional advice by grant recipients.\"\n\nSection 1008 of the Public Health Service Act specified that none of the federal funds appropriated under the Act's Title X for family-planning services \"shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\" In 1988, respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations requiring, \"inter alia\", that recipients of the federal funding \n(1) not engage in any counseling regarding abortion as a method for family planning; and\n(2) maintain an objective integrity and independence from abortion activities by the use of separate facilities, personnel, and accounting records.\n\nThe Court held that the regulations were a permissible construction of the statute and consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments.\n\n(1) The regulations were a permissible construction of Title X. The regulations did not violate the First Amendment free-speech rights of private Title X fund recipients, their staffs, or their patients by impermissibly imposing viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on government subsidies. Section 1008's abortion prohibition was constitutional because the government might make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and implement that judgment by using subsidies of public funds. \"Maher v. Roe\", 432 U.S. 464, 474 (1977). The use of public subsidies by the government was not rendered “discrimination” simply by the government's favoring one viewpoint over another.\n\n(2) The Secretary's construction of Title X must be accorded substantial deference by this Court because: (a) HHS was the agency charged with administering Title X, and (b) the Court could not look to § 1008 of Title X for interpretation. Section 1008 was ambiguous because it did not speak directly to abortion issues regarding counseling, and did not provide any guidance as to what was meant by “program integrity”. Moreover, the title neither defined § 1008's \"method of family planning\" phrase, nor enumerated what types of medical and counseling services were entitled to funding. The Secretary's construction of § 1008 would not be disturbed since (a) it was a plausible construction of the statute's plain language, (b) it did not conflict with Congress' expressed intent, and (c) the legislative history either was ambiguous as to Congress' intent on those issues or supported the Secretary's interpretation. The legislative history demonstrated that Congress had intended that Title X funds be kept separate and distinct from abortion-related activities. An agency must be given ample latitude to adapt its rules to changing circumstances. Thus, an interpretation that was different from previous interpretations deserved deference if it complimented the changes in circumstances. The Secretary's change of interpretation was amply supported by a \"reasoned analysis\" as the new regulations were more in keeping with Title X's original intent, which was supported by the testimony of client experience under the prior policy.\n\n(3) The Doctors' argument, that if the Government chooses to subsidize one viewpoint over a subject (here, abortion), then it must also balance that viewpoint by subsidizing its opposite, had clearly been rejected by the Court. Comparing, \"e.g.\", \"Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington\", 461 U.S. 540 (1983). The regulations do not force the Title X grantee, or its employees, to give up abortion-related speech; they merely require that such activities be kept separate and distinct from the activities of the Title X project. \"F.C.C. v. League of Women Voters of California\", 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984); \"Regan\", 461 U.S. at 546, distinguished.\n\n(4) Although it could be argued that the traditional doctor-patient relationship should enjoy First Amendment protection from government regulation, even when subsidized by the government (comparing, \"e.g.\", \"United States v. Kokinda\", 497 U.S. 720, 726 (1990)), that question need not be resolved, since the Title X program's regulations did not significantly impinge on the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n(5) The regulations did not violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy. The government had no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because it was constitutionally protected, and might validly choose to allocate public funds for medical services relating to childbirth but not to abortion. \"Webster v. Reproductive Health Services\", 492 U.S. 490, 510 (1989). Such allocation placed no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman wishing to terminate her pregnancy, and left her with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family planning services at all. See \"Harris v. McRae\" (1980). Nor did the regulations place restrictions on the patient/doctor dialogue which violated a woman's right to make an informed and voluntary choice under \"City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health\" (1983) and \"Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\" (1986). A doctor's ability to provide abortion-related information and a woman's right to receive such information remained unfettered outside the context of the Title X project.\n\nThe court's ruling was much broader than just abortion and family planning services; if the government pays for a program, it can attach substantive restrictions on speech by employees of the program. Thus federal funds for family planning programs could promote only childbirth options without violating the Constitution. Other views regarding abortion services could not be admitted within Title X's narrowly defined scope.\n\nSeveral family planning clinics challenged the Rust v. Sullivan regulations and requested declaratory judgements before the rules went into effect so that the clinics would not have to choose between receiving government funding or freedom of speech. Many clinics would find it economically unrealistic to separate their family-planning facilities from those for abortion services, and, therefore, would have to eliminate one part of their program. Title X projects now must be deemed “physically and financially separate” from facilities that do provide abortion counseling or services. Title X Projects can not provide counseling that deals with abortion as a method of family planning, provide referrals for abortion as a method of family planning, advocate abortion in any manner (including lobbying for its legalization or taking legal action to make abortion more accessible), or provide public speakers who promote abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nWomen and health organizations tried to force Congress to pass legislation that would overturn the regulations on abortions. An amendment to Title X was passed by Congress that said all pregnancy counseling, including family planning with abortion services, should be allowed at a government funded clinic when a pregnant patient wants it. However, President Bush vetoed this bill. The House narrowly failed to override the veto, so the bill failed.\n\nThe Bush administration decided to modify the regulations anyway. Among other things, the changes would have made it so that physicians could refer patients for abortions if it would prevent serious medical harm to the patient. However, the Bush administration did not follow proper administrative procedures that are required for issuing new regulations. As a result, Bush's changes was declared void by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Before any new policy could be made, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was elected to be the next President of the United States. Clinton promised during his campaign that his administration would eliminate the rule. President Bush did not try to reenact these policies between November and his last days as President of the United States in January 1993. The Rust v. Sullivan precedent stands as the current precedent on federal government leeway in utilizing funding policy to restrict the discussion of disfavored topics.\n\nBeginning over abortion rights and women's privacy rights, Rust v. Sullivan was a challenge to whether or not the government could regulate services provided in government funded facilities. Although the regulations were repealed, the Rust v. Sullivan decision remains a powerful defense of government restrictions on speech.\n\n\n"}

The Newshub brand replaced 3 News on the TV3 network and the Radio Live news service heard on MediaWorks Radio stations on 1 February 2016.\n\nThe first \"Newshub\" bulletin to air was at midnight on 1 February 2016 on Radio Live and was presented by Leanne Malcolm; the first \"Newshub\" TV bulletin to air was \"Newshub Midday\" the same day, presented by Jeff McTainsh.\n\nThe flagship 6:00 pm bulletin of \"Newshub\" is currently presented by Mike McRoberts and Samantha Hayes. \"Newshub Live at 6pm\" replaced the news bulletin as the same time, previously known as \"3 News at 6pm\". Melissa Davies & Tom McRae present the weekend edition at 6pm and are also back up anchors for Samantha Hayes and Mike McRoberts. Other back up anchors on Newshub Live at 6pm have included Hamish Clark and Simon Shepherd.\n\nNewshub Late is a night news show which usually airs weeknights around 10:30 pm, but can run later depending on the evening schedule. The bulletin was presented by Samantha Hayes until her promotion to an anchor of the 6pm news. Current anchors for \"Newshub Late\" include Sacha McNeil. This is TV3's fourth late night news show with the original show being \"Nightline\" between 1990 and 2013, \"The Paul Henry Show\" in 2014 and \"Newsworthy\" in 2015.\n\nLaunched on 20 March 2017, as \"Newshub Live at 4pm\", the bulletin airs for half an hour on weekdays at 4:30 pm and is presented by Susie Nordqvist. It was aired at 4 pm until 16 August 2019, where it moved to the 4:30 pm time slot.\n\n\"The AM Show\" is a New Zealand morning news and talk show that airs on Three and simulcast on Magic Talk. It is presented by Duncan Garner, with news anchor Amanda Gillies, sports presenter Mark Richardson, and social media presenter Aziz Al-Sa'afin. The show replaced \"Paul Henry\" after it was announced the frontman of the show, Paul Henry, was resigning and therefore the show was going to be replaced. The announcement was made by MediaWorks in November 2016, and Paul Henry last aired on 16 December 2016. The AM Show premiered on 13 February 2017.\n\n\"The Project\" is a New Zealand current affairs show hosted by Jesse Mulligan, Kanoa Lloyd, and Jeremy Corbett. It premiered on Three in early February 2017, and airs from 7pm to 7:30 pm. The show replaced \"Story\". The show's format is taken from the Australian version of the show, \"The Project\", which is a ratings hit on Network Ten.\n\n\"Newshub Nation\" is Three's in-depth political current affairs show focusing on the major players and forces that shape New Zealand. The show is presented by Simon Shepherd and Emma Jolliff and airs on Saturday mornings at 9:30am and Sunday mornings at 10:00 am. It is replayed on Magic Talk at 7PM Saturday night. Emma Jolliff died on February 6, 2020.\n\nThe TV3 6pm news bulletin was known as \"3 News\" or \"3 News at 6pm\" up until 31 January 2016. 3 News was originally known as \"3 National News\" and first went on air on Monday 27 November 1989 when TV3 began broadcasting. For the first year of broadcast, \"3 National News\" was a thirty-minute bulletin screening at 6:30 pm, which the same time slot as Holmes on TV1. The original bulletin was presented by former BCNZ and TVNZ anchor Philip Sherry, joined by sportscaster Greg Clark and weathercaster Belinda Todd.\n\nAmong the reports in the first day's bulletin were:\n\n\nIn 1991 TV3 extended \"3 National News\" to a 1-hour bulletin starting at 6pm, this occurred during the Gulf War but TV3 continued to screen a 1-hour bulletin following the war. TV3 used their 1-hour news bulletin of 3 National News as a selling point over One Network News which was still a 30-minute bulletin followed by the Holmes show, One Network News did not become a 1-hour bulletin until 1995. During the nine years that the bulletin was known as \"3 National News\" it had three different hosts. Original anchor Philip Sherry was replaced by Joanna Paul in 1990; Paul had previously been the anchor of the launch news update and weekend bulletins. When Paul opted not to renew her contract with the network, TV3 hired former TVNZ newsreader and It's in the Bag game show host, John Hawkesby.\n\nIn 1998, TV3 revamped its presentation, shortening the show's name to \"3 News\" and adding another presenter. They initially planned for Hawkesby and ex-TVNZ journalist Carol Hirschfeld to co-host. The planned Hawkesby-Hirschfeld team never eventuated, with John Campbell taking the male anchor role when Hawkesby walked out of TV3 to host One News. TV3 later sued TVNZ for \"interfering with the relationship\" between Hawkesby and TV3. The two parties settled out of court at the end of 2000 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn 2005, Hirschfeld and Campbell left their anchor positions to collaborate on current affairs show Campbell Live. They were replaced by Hilary Barry and Mike McRoberts. The same year, 3 News won the Best News Award at the Qantas Television Awards. In 2005, TV3's parent company Mediaworks New Zealand launched Radio Live.\n\nA new \"3 News\" studio set began use on 15 September 2008, this coincided with an updated graphics package using the 2005 – 2008 graphics as its base. On 4 July 2011, 3 News revamped its presentation package starting with the early morning show of the time \"Firstline\", to have the \"floating tiles\" look, which was in use up till the launch of Newshub on 1 February 2016.\n\nIn November 2012, 3 News won the Best News award at the 2012 New Zealand Television Awards.\n\nOn 27 January 2014, 3 News refreshed its split screen graphic, finance graphics and full frame graphics. At the same time, 3 News also updated their printed fake newsroom backdrop which they used while they temporarily broadcast from a green/blue screen set.\n\nIn early April 2015, it was announced that 3 News' Sunday bulletin would be reduced to half an hour and would be followed by a shortened version of the network's midweek current affairs programme 3rd Degree, which was later renamed \"3D\". The first of these shortened Sunday bulletins was broadcast on 24 May 2015.\n\nOn 19 December 2015, Studio 1 was decommissioned temporarily to prepare the studio for the launch of Newshub. During the refit of Studio 1, they broadcast from a green screen studio placed in the Paul Henry show set during the summer off-air time.\n\nThe last 3 News broadcast occurred on 31 January 2016 before the news brand renamed to Newshub.\nThe new look Studio 1 launched on 1 February 2016 designed by Jago Design, who also designed Studio 3, which is used for Paul Henry.\n\n\"Paul Henry \"was a cross-platform, morning breakfast news programme broadcast live on TV3 and Radio Live on weekdays between 6:00am and 9:00am. It was presented by Paul Henry with Ingrid Hipkiss as news anchor, and Jim Kayes as sports anchor. The show began to air on 7 April 2015 (replacing \"Firstline\") and retained its name after other 3 News shows were renamed to \"Newshub\".\n\n\"Story\" was a 30-minute current affairs show presented by Duncan Garner and Heather du-Plessis Allan. The show aired Monday to Thursday nights at 7:00 pm, with a less formal chat / entertainment show on Friday evenings at 7 pm. \"Story\" was first launched on 10 August 2015 and replaced \"Campbell Live\". On 16 December 2016, \"Story\" had its final show. \"Story\"s frontman, Duncan Garner, and co-host, Amanda Gillies, moved to the breakfast timeslot, for \"The AM Show\".\n\n\"Campbell Live\" was a half-hour-long New Zealand current affairs programme that was broadcast on weeknights on TV3 at 7:00 pm (following 3 News) and was hosted by New Zealand television personality, John Campbell. Backup presenters included Lachlan Forsyth, Carolyn Robinson and Rachel Smalley. It was first broadcast on 21 March 2005 and had its last show broadcast on Friday, 29 May 2015. It was replaced with \"Story\" that screened on Monday through Thursday nights, hosted by Duncan Garner and Heather du-Plessis Allan.\n\n\"Nightline\" was the late night edition of \"3 News\" broadcast. It was broadcast live on TV3 at approximately 10:30 pm and was anchored by Sacha McNeil. Backup anchors included Ingrid Hipkiss, Samantha Hayes, Susie Nordqvist or Carolyn Robinson. The show concluded on 20 December 2013, being replaced on 27 January 2014 with \"The Paul Henry Show,\" of which the final show aired on 19 December 2014. However an interim replacement simply named \"3 News\" was aired for several weeks at the beginning of 2014, and again in 2015 (before \"Newsworthy\" began) and 2016 (before \"Newshub Late\" began).\n\n\"Firstline\" was a morning news programme produced by \"3 News\". The show was cancelled in April 2015 and was replaced by \"Paul Henry\". It was anchored by Rachel Smalley, with Sam Ackerman as the sports anchor. The show began on Monday 7 March 2011 off the back of ongoing Christchurch earthquake coverage.\n\n\"The Paul Henry Show\" was a weekday late night news & entertainment programme hosted by Paul Henry. The show discussed the day's news with Henry's trademark take on events and also featured Janika ter Ellen as news anchor. Airing from 27 January to 19 December 2014, the show replaced the former \"Nightline\" in the late night weekday slot., It was replaced by \"Newsworthy\".\n\n\"Newsworthy\" was the late night edition of \"3 News\" in 2015 and broadcast live on TV3 at around 10:30 pm. It was anchored by Samantha Hayes and David Farrier. Backup anchors included Sacha McNeil and Jenny Suo. The show started on 8 June 2015 with mixed reviews, and the final show was broadcast on 18 December 2015.\n\n\"Sports Tonight\" was a sports information programme, broadcast live on TV3 weeknights following \"Nightline\". \"Sports Tonight\" was hosted by \"3 News\" sports journalist Howard Dobson. Substitutes included Jeff McTainsh, Andrew Gourdie or Sam Ackerman. The show was cancelled at the end of 2012, and its last programme aired on 21 December 2012.\n\n\"60 Minutes New Zealand\" was the local arm of the popular television franchise 60 Minutes. It was broadcast on Sunday evenings at 7:30 pm. The programme was presented by \"3 News\" anchor Mike McRoberts. The programme was cancelled at the end of 2012.\n\n\"3D Investigates\", originally named \"3rd Degree\", was created as a replacement for \"60 Minutes\". It was hosted by Duncan Garner and Guyon Espiner. It was later changed to a half-hour format and renamed \"3D Investigates\". Hosted by Duncan Garner and Samantha Hayes, it was TV3's flagship weekly current affairs programme, featuring stories from some of New Zealand's top journalists, including Paula Penfold, Sarah Hall, Melanie Reid, Phil Vine and Samantha Hayes.\n\n\"3D Investigates\" brought a human face to the issues that mattered to Kiwis, confronting the people who needed to be confronted, probing the secrets that needed to be uncovered, and celebrated New Zealanders who were living extraordinary lives. At the end of 2015 3D was cancelled.\n\n\"The Vote\" was produced by TV3's News and Current Affairs division with funding from NZ On Air. It screened once every four weeks in the same time slot as \"3rd Degree\" (later \"3D\"), TV3's former one-hour current affairs programme. The Vote was cancelled at the end of 2013.\n\n\"Three60\" was (at the time) TV3's newest current affairs show which focused on international news, politics & business. Three60 was presented by \"Newshub\" anchor Mike McRoberts and airs on Sunday mornings at 9:30am. The show has since been cancelled.\n\n\"Newshub Midday\" (formerly \"3 News @ 12\") was a half-hour bulletin broadcast live on TV3 weekdays at 12:00 pm. The show was anchored by Jeff McTainsh. Backup presenters include Simon Shepherd, Tom McRae and Melissa Davies.\n\n\"Newshub Midday\" was axed in June 2016, airing its last show on 1 July that year. It was replaced by a digital current affairs bulletin called \"Newshub Explains\", which began on 18 July 2016.\n\nNewshub Breaking News Specials are often aired during local and international, one-off and breaking news events. Newshub has aired specials for the following events:\n\n\"Newshub\" uses the international and domestic news sources of ITV News, Sky News, Channel 4 (UK), CBS News, Reuters, Seven News and Sky News New Zealand.\n\n"}
{"id": "2272724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272724", "title": "Entry by troops", "text": "Entry by troops\n\nEntry by troops is a term that developed in the Baháʼí Faith to describe a process of expansion when the Baha'i Faith would emerge from relative obscurity as a \"steady flow of reinforcements\" of \"troops of peoples of divers nations and races\" would embrace it (Letter dated 25 June 1953, Shoghi Effendi, Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957. Bahá'í Publishing Trust, Wilmette, 1980. p. 117 [18] The term first appeared in Baháʼu'lláh's Suriy-i-Haykal.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith currently claims more than five million members, in almost every country of the world.\n\nEntry by troops is seen as a process, not a singular event. It is seen as foreshadowing of a large-scale embracing of the Baha'i Faith, when a majority of the world will recognize and accept the teachings of Baha'u'llah. As Shoghi Effendi says,\n\nThis effort was launched in order to raise up Local Assemblies and National Assemblies all over the world so that a Universal House of Justice could be elected that would be representative of a worldwide Baha'i membership. The efforts of worldwide expansion that characterized the Ten Year Crusade from 1953 to 1963 were followed by massive enrollments in some parts of the world. Because there is no Baha'i clergy, Baha'u'llah has enjoined every believer to share and explain His teachings to the best of their ability. In some cases, individuals settled and lived out their lives in other countries. Almost every country in the world which had no Baháʼís was at least visited by a travelling teacher. \n\nIn 2000, the Universal House of Justice published \"Century of Light\", which reviewed the accomplishments and setbacks of the previous century. A major conclusion of the book was the need to focus on long-term teaching goals. For example, a 1975 letter from the Universal House of Justice said the following:\n\nThe Universal House of Justice has announced consecutive multi-year plans. From 1996 to 2000, the Four Year Plan focused on strengthening \"communities, institutions, and believers.\" From 2000 to 2001, the Twelve Month Plan focused on creating activities and further building an administrative structure. In this time the Regional Baháʼí Council (RBC) was created in very large countries, where an intermediary was necessary between the National and Local to help National Assemblies communicate and interact with local communities. From 2001 to 2006, the Five Year Plan has focused on three so-called core activities, which comprise devotional gatherings, children's classes, and study circles. An additional aspect newly created was the categorizing of areas into \"clusters\" that comprise groupings of communities, such as a metropolitan area or county. From 2006 to 2011 the Five Year Plan introduced Junior Youth Activities recognizing the pre-adolescent years as crucial in a person's spiritual growth.\n\nThe practice of study circles has helped introduce large numbers of individuals to the teachings of Baha'u'llah by training tutors to lead discussions using books containing excerpts from the Writings. In India, which has the largest population of Baháʼís in the world, a single cluster had two thousand individuals become Baháʼís within a six-month period. Within the following year, one thousand of them had finished Ruhi book 2. Similar trends have been observed in Mongolia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh among others (all in relatively large numbers); and in Eastern Europe and even Britain (all in somewhat smaller numbers). Many other communities around the world have experienced increased growth and activity since 2000. It should be noted, however, that numbers alone don't indicate depth of devotion to carry out Baha'u'llah's teachings or commitment to helping to fortify Baha'i communities.\n\nA letter written to a Baháʼí on behalf of Shoghi Effendi has a section that gives a clear perspective of the Baháʼí attitude toward mass conversion.\n"}

It was produced by Caravan Pictures. It is based on the 1991 novel \"Angie, I Says\" by Avra Wing, which was a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of 1991. The film received mixed to negative reviews and was a box office bomb, grossing only $9.4 million against its $26 million budget.\n\nAngie (Geena Davis) is an office worker who lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York and dreams of a better life. After learning that she is pregnant by her boyfriend Vinnie (James Gandolfini), she decides that she will have the baby, but not Vinnie as a husband.\n\nThis turns the entire neighborhood upside down and starts her on a journey of self-discovery, including a love affair with a man named Noel (Stephen Rea) who she meets at an art museum. Even her best friend Tina (Aida Turturro) has trouble understanding her.\n\n\n20th Century Fox films head Joe Roth, production president Roger Birnbaum and producer Larry Brezner had “Angie, I Says” under development. Todd Graff had written the screenplay for Madonna. The adaptation was placed into turnaround. Roth and Birnbaum had left for an independent label at Disney, Caravan Pictures, and were able to get the “Angie, I Says” adaptation moved over. Because of scheduling conflicts with her role in Abel Ferrara’s movie \"Dangerous Game\", which is also produced by her company, Maverick, she dropped out of the then Jonathan Kaplan-directed movie. Madonna had wanted them to push back production on the film, but given that it was a winter story, Caravan wanted to film it in winter, then debut it in winter. She bowed out as they also took issue with her lack of acting experience. The lead role was then offered to Geena Davis.\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews and was a box office bomb. In addition, Geena Davis, who won an Oscar six years before for \"The Accidental Tourist\" received mixed to negative reviews. Critics felt she could have been better in this movie or another set in Brooklyn. The film was famous for introducing three actors who would star on the TV show \"The Sopranos\": James Gandolfini, Aida Turturro, and Michael Rispoli. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B\" on scale of A+ to F.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2272745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272745", "title": "Gromia", "text": "Gromia\n\nGromia is a genus of protists, closely related to foraminifera, which inhabit marine and freshwater environments. \"Gromia\" are ameboid, producing filose pseudopodia that extend out from the cell’s proteinaceous test through a gap enclosed by the cell’s oral capsule. The test, a shell made up of protein that encloses the cytoplasm, is made up of several layers of membrane, which resemble honeycombs in shape — a defining character of this genus. \n\n\"Gromia\" were first discovered in shallow waters, with members of the best-characterized species Gromia oviformus often found inhabiting rock surfaces, sediments or seaweed holdfasts . However, research from the 1990s and early 2000s identified gromiids inhabiting depths up to 4,392 m, leading to several new deep-sea Gromia species being described and recognized . A recent study of the deep sea species \"Gromia sphaerica\" revealed that it produces traces on the seafloor which resemble the fossils of early Bilateria (animals with bilateral symmetry), which called into question whether such fossils can serve as reliable documentation of early animal diversification in the Precambian era \n\nDeep-sea gromiids have also been shown to be important for carbon cycling and denitrification .\n\n\"Gromia\" were first described in the 1835, with \"G. oviformis\" gaining prominence because it was often found in the intertidal zones on the British coast . Initially, Gromia were regarded as members of Foraminifera or Filosea, as noted in a review by Cifelli (1990) . \"Gromia\" became better characterized throughout the 1960s, when electron microscopy revealed more details on their morphology, including the honeycomb membranes . The first molecular studies involving Gromia, which sampled G. oviformis, used small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA genes and concluded that Gromia were members of Cercozoa, a large group of amoebae with tests and filose pseudopodia . Follow-up studies on this group placed Gromia within the Gromiidea class, again based on SSU rRNA genes Eventually, when molecular studies combined data from several genes — actin, polyubiquitin, RNA polymerase II and small subunit rRNA genes —Gromia was shown to be a sister group to Foraminifera . Moreover, within the genus \"Gromia\", studies of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes of various deep sea gromiids has revealed species diversity within \"Gromia\", with molecular data tending to correlate with distinct morphologies of the various species’ tests .\n\n\"Gromia\" were long thought to only inhabit shallow waters, until samples from the Arabian Sea from depths below 1,000 m revealed the first deep sea gromiid — Gromia spherica . Additional species of deep sea \"Gromia\" protists were later described in waters from the Arabian sea, the European Arctic sea, and off the coast of Antarctica, among other locations, and characterized both morphologically and through molecular studies of their small subunit rRNA genes .\n\nGromiids inhabit sediments or surfaces of flora in both shallow waters and the deep sea. The best characterized species of shallow-water \"Gromia\", \"G. oviformis\", inhabits intertidal zones and other regions of shallow waters, often found attached to rocks, kelp, weeds, Cladophora algae, or within sediments . \"G. oviformis\" has been shown to tolerate a temperature range of 0 - 30°C.\n\nDeep-sea gromiids have been found in the Arabian sea , off the coast of Antarctica and in the water of the Northwest Atlantic ocean . They were often collected from the 1000-3,100 m range . Oxygen levels in gromiid habitats tend to exceed 0.2ml/l and are therefore not limiting to the organisms’ growth. The temperature tolerance of deep-sea Gromia is uncertain. \n\n\"Gromia\" are thought to acquire nutrients from the organic matter in sediments on the sea floor, as they are often found in areas with abundant phytodetritus . Their apertures face down on sediment surfaces and they use their pseudopodia to feed .\n\nGromiids found in the deep sea near Oman and Pakistan are often found with Foraminifera, filamentous prokaryotes and bacteria living on their cell surface . Gromiids provide substrates and serve as a surface for attachment to their epibionts.\n\n\"Gromia\" members are quite large, ranging from 0.4 mm to 30 mm . Their proteinaceous tests vary in shapes, from spherical (\"e.g.\" \"G. oviformis\"), “sausage shaped,” “grape-shaped” or pear-shaped (\"e.g. G. pyriforminis\") . Test shape is often used for classifying \"Gromia\" species, and their morphology tends to align with the molecular data used to differentiate species. The interior of the test is layered with membranes with a honeycomb pattern. These honeycomb membranes are a unique feature of \"Gromia\". \n\nAn oral complex containing an aperture, which is an opening in the test, allows the filose pseudopodia to extend out . The pseudopodia are non-granular, and can form connections to make net-like structures . Gromia use their pseudopodia to crawl along the surface of sediments . Stercomata, or waste pellets, as well as mineral grains accumulate inside the cell — another characteristic feature of Gromia ).\n\n\"Gromia\" have been observed to undergo both asexual and sexual reproduction. In sexual reproduction observed in \"G. oviformis\", the shells of adult organisms fuse . Gametogenesis and fertilization follow, after which the zygotes mature into amoebulae and exit the parental shells. \n\nGromiids are hypothesized to be important for carbon cycling, as they are often found in carbon-rich sediments and feed on detritus . In addition, gromiids have been shown to store high levels of intracellular nitrate, suggesting a role for gromiids in denitrification .\n\nGromiids have also enriched our understanding of evolutionary history. The ability of the giant, deep sea species \"G. sphaerica\" to produce tracks on the sea floor has been used to propose a re-evaluation of the use of fossils with similar traces as evidence for dating the origins of animals with bilateral symmetry \n\nChromista, Harosa, Rhizaria, Cercozoa, Endomyxa, Grommidea, Gromia, Gromiidae, \"Gromia\" \n\n\"Gromia oviformis\" Dujardin, 1835\n\n\"Gromia appendiculariae\" Brooks & Kellner, 1908\n\n\"Gromia dubia \"Gruber, 1884\n\n\"Gromia dujardinii\" Schultze, 1854\n\n\"Gromia fluvialis\" Dujardin, 1837\n\n\"Gromia granulata\" Schulze, 1875\n\n\"Gromia solenopus\" Zarnik, 1907\n\n\"Gromia granulata\" Schulze, 1875\n\n\"Gromia hyalina\" Schlumberger, 1845\n\n\"Gromia paludosa\" Cienkowski, 1876\n\n\"Gromia schulzei\" Norman, 1892\n\n\"Gromia terricola\" Leidy, 1874\n\n\"Gromia sphaerica\" Gooday, Bowser, Bett & Smith 2000\n\n"}

{"id": "2272750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272750", "title": "New Tricks", "text": "New Tricks\n\nNew Tricks is a British television procedural crime drama, created by Nigel McCrery and Roy Mitchell, produced primarily by Wall to Wall (until its final year, when it was handled by Headstrong Pictures), and broadcast on BBC One. The programme originally began with a pilot episode on 27 March 2003, before a full series with commissioned for 1 April 2004, with it concluding after twelve series on 6 October 2015. The main cast, which changed over time, included the involvement of Alun Armstrong, James Bolam, Amanda Redman, Dennis Waterman, Denis Lawson, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Tamzin Outhwaite, and Larry Lamb.\n\nThe premise of the series focused on the work of the Unsolved Crime and Open Case Squad (UCOS) - a fictional division within London's Metropolitan Police Service tasked with re-investigating unsolved crimes. UCOS primarily functioned with a senior police detective overseeing the work of three retired police officers who would handle each case, and who could bring in police support when needed. Each episode focused on a different investigation, with characters often coping with problems at their age but using their wisdom to overcome hurdles in the original investigation of cold cases. Both creators, McCrery and Mitchell, devised the title of the programme around the proverb \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\".\n\n\"New Tricks\" began as a one-off episode broadcast on 27 March 2003. This attracted sufficient viewers for the BBC to commission a series of six episodes, which began on 1 April 2004. Eight-episode series were subsequently commissioned for 2005, 2006 and 2007. A fifth series was commissioned by the BBC after the audience share rose week upon week for the previous series. In 2007, an episode from the fourth series received viewing figures of 9.25 million, becoming the second most-watched programme on BBC One that week, and the most-watched \"New Tricks\" episode to that point. The fifth series continued this good run – on two occasions it was the most-watched programme in Britain for the week, and the seventh episode gained a new series high rating of 9.36 million—second only to the \"X Factor\" that week. The fifth series aired from 7 July to 25 August 2008. The sixth series finished location filming on 8 May 2009 in central London and began airing on 16 July 2009. The opening episode of series six was watched by 8.07 million, despite clashing with Five's \"The Mentalist\" (1.64m) and ITV's \"Living With Michael Jackson\" (3.64m). The second episode clashed with \"The Mentalist\" and the relaunch of \"The Bill\" on ITV, and was watched by 7.59 million.\n\nSeries 7 and 8 were commissioned by the BBC in September 2009, ensuring that the show would run until 2011. The seventh series began airing on 10 September 2010 and completed its run on 12 November. The eighth series opened on 4 July 2011 with 9.2 million viewers, the show's highest rating for three years, and the first since the fifth series to break the 9 million barrier. The third episode of series 8, \"Lost in Translation\", was the show's highest rated episode to date with 9.7 million viewers, becoming the most-watched television programme of the week in the UK. Episode 7, \"The Gentleman Vanishes,\" surpassed this figure with 9.87 million viewers, and was again the top programme of the week.\n\nThe BBC confirmed in September 2011 that a further two series, each of 10 episodes, had been commissioned, to be broadcast in 2012 and 2013. James Bolam, who played the part of Jack Halford, left the show, claiming that it had \"become stale\", making his final regular appearance in the first episode of Series 9 and a guest appearance in Series 10, episode 8. In the fourth episode, Denis Lawson joined the cast, as the new character of retired DI Steve McAndrew. Prior to the ninth series premiere, both Amanda Redman and Alun Armstrong announced that they would be leaving the show after the 10th series. The first programme of series nine was broadcast on 27 August 2012, and gained 8.52 million viewers, which was the highest rating of the week. \"Only Fools and Horses\" actor Nicholas Lyndhurst and former \"EastEnders\" actress Tamzin Outhwaite appeared in Series 10, which was broadcast in Britain between 30 July and 1 October 2013. The opening episode of the 10th series gained an audience of 8.86 million viewers, making it the 12th most-watched programme of the year.\n\nEpisode 1 of season 11 was broadcast at 21:00 GMT on BBC One and BBC One HD on 18 August 2014. Ratings fell considerably from series 10 to series 11 when most of the original cast left; series 10 had an average per-episode viewership of 8.35 million, while series 11 managed an average per-episode viewership of 5.75 million.\n\nA 12th series of the show began filming in the Autumn of 2014, and started broadcasting on 4 August 2015. It was also revealed that Dennis Waterman would be leaving the series in the early episodes. In February 2015 it was announced that the 12th series would be the last. It was shot at West London Film Studios.\n\nThe series was broadcast in at least 25 countries, and was also available on DVD and via online streaming. \"New Tricks\" was produced by Wall to Wall Television for the BBC between 2003 and 2014, and Headstrong Pictures thereafter.\n\nIn 2011, James Bolam left the show to be replaced by Denis Lawson. In 2012, both Alun Armstrong and Amanda Redman departed to be replaced by Nicholas Lyndhurst and Tamzin Outhwaite, respectively. In September 2014, Dennis Waterman announced that he would be leaving the show after filming two episodes of the next series. Larry Lamb replaced him for the rest of the final series.\n\nRoy Mitchell, creator of the series, being a supporter of the English football team West Bromwich Albion, named numerous characters after past and then-current players. The original three main male characters derived their names from the club's oldest stand, \"The Halfords Lane Stand\", at The Hawthorns football ground in West Bromwich.\n\nThe theme tune of the programme is sung by cast member Dennis Waterman. The song is \"It's Alright\" (written by Mike Moran). Production music was composed by father and son team Brian and Warren Bennett with technical assistance from Olivia Davies. The British release of the first series DVD contains a cover version of \"End of the Line\" sung by Dennis Waterman at the end of the pilot episode.\n\nSeries 1 to 12 of \"New Tricks\" are available on DVD on Region 2 (UK). These titles are distributed by Acorn Media UK.\n\n"}

It predates the \"Mahōtsukai Sunny\" (whose name became Sally in the Sally the Witch anime) manga, printed in 1966. However, that title's anime adaptation is the first magical girl anime, as \"Himitsu\" \"no Akko-chan\" was not broadcast until 1969.\n\nThe original anime ran for 94 episodes from 1969 to 1970. It was animated by Toei Animation and broadcast by TV Asahi (then known as NET). It has been remade twice, in 1988 (61 episodes, featuring Mitsuko Horie in the role of Akko-chan and singing the opening and ending themes) and in 1998 (44 episodes).\n\nThree movies were produced. \"Circus Da Ga Kenyatta\" in 1969, and Himitsu \"no Akko-chan Movie\" and \"Himitsu No Akko-Chan:\" \"Umi da! Obake da!! Natsu Matsuri\" both released in 1989. It was adapted into a live action film released in September 1, 2012.\n\nCurrently, an adaptation of the series is running as a web manga, \"ひみつのアッコちゃん μ\" (\"Himitsu no Akko-Chan μ\", pronounced \"myu\".) It is written by Hiroshi Izawa, and drawn by Futago Kamikita.\n\nAtsuko Kagami is an elementary school girl who has an affinity for mirrors. One day, her favorite mirror which was given to Akko by her mother (or in some versions, by her father, as a present from India) is broken, and she prefers to bury it in her yard rather than throw it to the trash can.\n\nIn her dreams, she is contacted by a spirit (or in some cases the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom) who is touched that the girl would treat the mirror so respectfully and not simply throw it away. Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught enchantments, such as \"Tekumaku mayakon, tekumaku mayakon\" and \"Lamipasu lamipasu lu lu lu lu lu\", that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes.\n\nVoiced by Yoshiko Ōta (1969), Mitsuko Horie (1988), Wakana Yamazaki (1998) in the animes, and played in live-action by Haruka Ayase (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only media in the franchise to be officially translated into English is the 1980s run of the manga, translated as \"Akko-Chan's Got a Secret!\" The series briefly aired in its original Japanese on California channel KWHY-TV in the mid 1970s as Akko Chan's Secret.\n\nOtherwise largely unknown in the English-speaking world, \"Himitsu no Akko-chan\" enjoyed a good deal of success when it was exported to the European market in the 1980s. All three \"Akko-chan\" series have been screened on TV in Italy.\n\n"}

{"id": "2272780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272780", "title": "Paperweight", "text": "Paperweight\n\nA paperweight is a small solid object heavy enough (usually a glass marble), when placed on top of papers, to keep them from blowing away in a breeze or from moving under the strokes of a painting brush (as with Japanese calligraphy). While any object (like a stone) can serve as a paperweight, decorative paperweights of glass are produced, either by individual artisans or factories, usually in limited editions, and are collected as works of fine glass art, some of which are exhibited in museums. First produced in about 1845, particularly in France, such decorative paperweights declined in popularity before undergoing a revival in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nDecorative glass paperweights have a flat or slightly concave base, usually polished but sometimes frosted, cut in one of several variations (e.g. star-cut bases have a multi-pointed star, while a diamond cut base has grooves cut in a criss-cross pattern), although a footed weight has a flange in the base. The ground on which the inner parts rest may be clear or colored, made of unfused sand, or resemble lace (latticinio). The domed top is usually faceted or cut and made of lead glass and may be coated with one or more thin layers of colored glass, and have windows cut through it to reveal the interior motif. The exact shape or profile of the dome varies from one artist or factory to another, but in fine examples will act as a lens that, as one moves the weight about, attractively varies the inner design's appearance. A magnifying glass is often used to gain appreciation of the fine detail of the work within. In a modern piece, an identifying mark and date are imperative.\n\nPaperweights are made by individual artisans or in factories where many artists and technicians collaborate; both may produce inexpensive as well as \"collector\" weights.\n\nWorkmanship, design, rarity, and condition determine a paperweight's value: its glass should not have a yellow or greenish cast, and there should be no unintentional asymmetries, or unevenly spaced or broken elements. Visible flaws, such as bubbles, striations and scratches lessen the value.\n\nAntique paperweights, of which perhaps 10,000 or so survive (mostly in museums), generally appreciate steadily in value; as of August 2018 the record price was the $258,500 paid in 1990 for an antique French weight.\n\nAntique paperweights were made in the \"classic\" years between 1845 and 1860 primarily in three French factories named Baccarat, St. Louis, and Clichy. Together, they made between 15,000 and 25,000 weights in the classic period. Weights (mainly of lesser quality) were also made in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere, though Bacchus (UK) and New England Glass Company (US) produced some that equaled the best of the French. Modern weights have been made from about 1950 to the present.\n\nIn the US, Charles Kaziun started in 1940 to produce buttons, paperweights, inkwells and other bottles, using lamp-work of elegant simplicity. In Scotland, the pioneering work of Paul Ysart from the 1930s onward preceded a new generation of artists such as William Manson, Peter McDougall, Peter Holmes and John Deacons. A further impetus to reviving interest in paperweights was the publication of Evangiline Bergstrom's book, \"Old Glass Paperweights\", the first of a new genre.\n\nA number of small studios appeared in the middle 20th century, particularly in the US. These may have several to some dozens of workers with various levels of skill cooperating to produce their own distinctive \"line\". Notable examples are Lundberg Studios, Orient and Flume, Correia Art Glass, St.Clair, Lotton, and Parabelle Glass.\n\nStarting in the late 1960s and early 70s, artists such as Francis Whittemore, Paul Stankard, his former assistant Jim D'Onofrio, Chris Buzzini, Delmo and daughter Debbie Tarsitano, Victor Trabucco and sons, Gordon Smith, Rick Ayotte and his daughter Melissa, the father and son team of Bob and Ray Banford, and Ken Rosenfeld began breaking new ground and were able to produce fine paperweights rivaling anything produced in the classic period.\n\nCollectors may specialize in one of several types of paperweights, but more often they wind up with an eclectic mix.\n\nMillefiori (Italian - \"thousand flowers\") paperweights contain thin cross-sections of cylindrical composite canes made from colored rods and usually resemble little flowers, although they can be designed after anything, even letters and dates. These are usually made in a factory setting. They exist in many variations such as scattered, patterned, close concentric or carpet ground. Sometimes the canes are formed into a sort of upright tuft shaped like a mushroom that is encased in the dome. The year of manufacture is sometimes enclosed in one of the canes.\n\nLampwork paperweights have objects such as flowers, fruit, butterflies or animals constructed by shaping and working bits of colored glass with a gas burner or torch and assembling them into attractive compositions, which are then incorporated into the dome. This is a form particularly favored by studio artists. The objects are often stylized, but may be highly realistic.\n\nSulfide paperweights have an encased cameo-like medallion or portrait plaque made from a special ceramic that is able to reproduce very fine detail. These are known as incrustations, cameo incrustations, or sulphides. They often are produced to commemorate some person or event. From the late 1700s through the end of the 1900s, an amazing variety of glass objects, including paperweights, were made with incrustations. The finest collection of incrustations ever assembled was by Paul Jokelson, collector, author and founder of the Paperweight Collectors' Association. A part of his collection was gifted to the Corning Museum of Glass, with the remaining portion being sold in London in the 1990s. Although still produced today, their heyday was before the classic period.\n\nMost paperweights, which are considered works of art, use one of the above techniques; millefiori, lampwork or sulphide — all techniques that had been around long before the advent of paperweights. A fourth technique, a crimp flower, usually a rose, originated in the Millville, New Jersey area in the first decade of the twentieth century. Often called a Millville rose, these weights range from simple folk art to fine works of art, depending on the maker.\n\nFine weights not made with any of the major techniques include swirls, marbries and crowns. Swirl paperweights have opaque rods of two or three colors radiating like a pinwheel from a central millefiori floret. A similar style, the marbrie, is a paperweight that has several bands of color close to the surface that descend from the apex in a looping pattern to the bottom of the weight. Crown paperweights have twisted ribbons, alternately colored and white filigree which radiate from a central millefiori floret at the top, down to converge again at the base. This was first devised in the Saint Louis factory and remains popular today.\n\nMiniature weights have a diameter of less than two inches or so, and magnums have a diameter greater than about 3.25 inches.\n\nCalifornia-style paperweights are made by \"painting\" the surface of the dome with colored molten glass (torchwork), and manipulated with picks or other tools. They may also be sprayed while hot with various metallic salts to achieve an iridescent look.\n\nVictorian portrait and advertising paperweights were dome glass paperweights first made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania using a process patented in 1882 by William H. Maxwell. The portrait paperweights contained pictures of ordinary people reproduced on a milk glass disk and encased within clear glass. This same process was also used to produce paperweights with the owner's name encased or an advertisement of a business or product. Pittsburgher Albert A. Graeser, patented a different process for making advertising paperweights in 1892. The Graeser process involved sealing an image to the underside of a rectangular glass blank using a milk glass or enamel-like glaze. Many paperweights of the late 19th century are marked either J. N. Abrams or Barnes and Abrams and may list either the 1882 Maxwell or 1892 Graeser patent date. It has been theorized that Barnes and Abrams did not actually manufacture advertising paperweights for their customers, but instead subcontracted the actual manufacturing task out to Pittsburgh area glasshouses. The Paperweight Collectors Association Annual Bulletins published in 2000, 2001 and 2002 describe these in detail.\n\nBohemian paperweights were particularly popular in Victorian times. Large engraved or cut hollow spheres of ruby glass were a common form.\n\nThe United States has a number of museums exhibiting outstanding paperweight collections. Many collectors consider the finest of these to be the Arthur Rubloff collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, which expanded its exhibition in 2012. The Bergstrom-Mahler Museum in Neenah, Wisconsin, exhibits the Evangeline Bergstrom collection. The Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, exhibits the Amory Houghton collection. The Yelverton Paperweight Centre in Devon, England, a collection of over 1,000 paperweights, closed in 2013.\n\nAnother museum with a notable exhibition of outstanding American paperweights is in the Museum of American Glass at the Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center in Millville, New Jersey. In 1998, Henry Melville Fuller donated 330 twentieth-century paperweights to the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\nThere are many paperweight collectors worldwide. Several collectors' associations hold national or regional conventions, and sponsor activities such as tours, lectures, and auctions. Famous collectors include the literary figures Colette, Oscar Wilde and Truman Capote. Empress Eugenie (Napoleon III's wife), Empress Carlotta (wife of Maximilian I of Mexico) and Farouk, King of Egypt were also avid collectors. The collecting histories of Rubloff, Bergstrom, and Houghton were similar. They had two things in common — a passion for their collecting, and the privilege of having sufficient financial resources to build extensive collections of very rare and expensive weights. Another famous collector was Lothar-Günther Buchheim, the German author and painter. He is best known for his novel \"Das Boot\" (1973), which became an international bestseller and was adapted in 1981 as an Oscar-nominated film. His collection of about 3,000 paperweights can be seen at his museum in Germany - Museum der Phanthasie - in Bernried, Bavaria, Starnberger See (Lake). Marnie Bjornson has amassed one of the most notable collections in Canada, focusing on the history of the Icelandic communities of Manitoba.\n\nIn May, 1953 collector Paul Jokelson organized and created the Paperweight Collectors Association(PCA) the world's first collecting group dedicated to glass paperweights. Interest grew rapidly and by May 1954, membership had risen to 280 members and the PCA published its first Bulletin. The PCA held its first Convention in May 1961, in New York City with 100 members in attendance. In September 1968, Paul Jokelson published the first PCA Newsletter. In September 1995, the PCA entered the digital era, going online with the PCA, Inc. website. In December 2010 the PCA Facebook Page was created, allowing for casual observers, aficionados, artists, and collectors to become ever more connected, allowing for the appreciation of this enchanting art to thrive. Today membership spans the globe.\n\nPCA Members receive a newsletter four times a year and a printed Annual Bulletin. The Annual Bulletin is the only publication of its kind and the preeminent source for all things paperweight related. It contains indispensable, up-to-date research on the great paperweight makers of the 19th century and the masters of the art today. The PCA holds a Convention biennially, where collectors, artists, dealers and scholars from around the world meet to share their passion for the art of the paperweight. At the Convention, attendees can expect to see artists demonstrations from some of the world's leading glass artists, see presentations from paperweight scholars and artists, and see some of the world's finest paperweights on display.\n\n\n"}

He is best remembered for his defense of the Purandar Fort against Dilir Khan, a Mughal general who accompanied Mirza Raja Jai Singh in the 17th-century siege on Purandar.\n\nMurarbaji Deshpande was born into a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu or CKP family and his native land was the Kinjaloli near Mahad, Raigad District. He was the gallant commander who commanded 700 mavle (maratha troop) to attack Diler Khan.\n\nThe battle for Purandar fort was a landmark battle of symbolic importance for both the Marathas and Mughals. It was essential for the Marathas to hold off the Mughals for as long as possible, thus demonstrating the difficulty of conquering the mountainous Maratha Empire. It was equally imperative for the Mughals to conquer Purandar as swiftly as possible to demonstrate the futility of resistance of the dominant Mughal empire.\n\nIn the end, superior European cannons fielded by the Mughals, under the leadership of the European mercenary Mannucci, blasted away the walls of Purandar. In spite of crumbling defenses, Murarbaji and his troops sustained a dogged defense. When the Mughals breached the outer walls, Murarbaji and his soldiers, though overwhelmingly outnumbered, mounted a fierce counterattack. Maratha folk history has it that Murarbaji showed incredible skills as a swordsman and was an aggressive and inspiring leader who pushed back and caused a retreat of a larger Mughal force.\n\nDiler Khan, impressed with the bravery of Murarbaji, offered him a truce and employment in the Mughal forces with a handsome salary. Murarbaji turned down the offer due to his loyalty to the ideals of Hindavi Swarajya. He was extremely enraged at this very suggestion and in an act of extreme daredevilry charged with his commandos right into the heart of the Mughal troops, killing hundreds. The remaining Marathas retreated inside the inner walls (baalekilla) of the fort, refusing to surrender and willing to fight to the last man.\n\nThe battle of Purandar showed the Marathas the difficulty in facing the overwhelming force led by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, and revealed to the Mughal the tenacity of the Marathas. Thereafter Shivaji agreed to surrender to Mirza Raja rather than risk the decimation of his forces and the ruin of his homeland. Aurangzeb sought to sign the treaty of Purandar and invited Shivaji to Agra rather than face a protracted and expensive campaign to conquer Marathas. As a part of the settlement Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts and 4,00,000 hons to the Mughals. He also agreed to let his son Sambhaji become a Mughal Sardar and serve the Mughal court of Aurangzeb.\n"}

Classes are taught in Cantonese in the primary school and in English in the secondary school.\n\nIn the 1960s, large numbers of immigrants came to Hong Kong from mainland China. Wooden shacks covered the hills of Kowloon, and fires, landslides and epidemics threatened the inhabitants of those shacks. In 1953, a big fire in Shek Kip Mei left fifty-three thousand homeless. The Government began to focus on the provision of public services such as safe housing, medical care and education.\n\nFr. Peter A. Reilly, a Catholic priest of the Maryknoll Fathers, came to Hong Kong in 1952. He had been a missionary in Wuchow, Kwangsi, since 1941, but alongside other missionaries had been expelled from China when the Communists came to power in 1952. Fr. Reilly set up a mission to serve the poor in a small wooden hut in Kowloontsai, where thousands of refugees lived. He set aside a study room and hired teachers to educate the children of the area.\n\nFr. Reilly applied to the Government for permission to build a subsidised school. To his happy surprise, the Government granted permission not only for him to build the primary school he had hoped for, but also to build a subsidised secondary school, the first of its kind in Hong Kong. Fr. Reilly sought the help of Mrs. Tong Yu Sheung Woon, then headmistress of Yan Pak School, to find students and teachers for the school. The school was built next to the nullah after which Tai Hung Tung is named (\"Tai Hang Tung\" means, literally, \"east of the big nullah\"). On 26 September 1957, Rt. Rev. Bishop Lawrence Bianchi and Governor Sir Alexander Grantham presided over the official opening and blessing of the school. Fr. Reilly became the school's first supervisor, and Mrs. Tong its first principal.\n\nIn 1959, the secondary section produced its first graduates, who achieved excellent results. Many students also received the gift of faith and God's call.\n\nEncouraged by these successes and by the need to provide education for the children in the district, the Maryknoll Fathers applied to the Education Department for an expansion of the school by the acquisition of a site behind it. The request was approved. On 17 February 1966, Rt. Rev. Bishop Frederick Donaghy (former bishop of Wuchow) blessed the New Wing, which provided space for a library, twelve new classrooms, improved science facilities and a hall that could seat five hundred.\n\nIn January 2009, the primary section moved to a new campus at 11 Hoi Lai Street, Sham Shui Po. It became a full-day school in February that year (before that, it had been a half-day school).\n\nFr. Reilly served as supervisor for the rest of his life. He died in St Teresa's Hospital in 1994. Fr. John Geitner took up the post from 1995 to 2011, followed by Fr. Michael Sloboda from 2011 until 2017. Ms. Agnes Garman Yeh is the current supervisor.\n\nMrs. Tong Yu Sheung Woon died in November 2005 in Toronto, Canada, at the age of 94. Currently, the principal of the secondary school is Mr. Ho Lik Sang and the principal of the primary school is Mrs. Ng Wai Man.\n\nIn 2008, two students of the school, Lau Tak Kin and Lau Tak Shing (not related), were awarded second place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) for their invention of an \"anti-bump lock\" that could counter bump keys. Two minor planets (25065 and 25073) were named in their honour. In 2014, another student, Kan Wing Yi, was awarded second place in the Intel ISEF for her invention of biodegradable bandages. A minor planet (31313) was named in her honour.\n\nThe first official alumni unit is the Maryknoll Fathers' School Peer Counsellors Alumni (MFSPCA), established in 1996, which aims to maintain contacts for ex-peer counsellors and mentors of the student mentoring scheme held by the counselling department. The MFSPCA holds activities such as Christmas Snowball, summer outings and a pen-pal scheme for its members.\n\nIn 2005, Maryknoll Fathers' School Alumni Ltd, the official alumni unit for all graduates, was established. Currently the lifetime membership is HKD$1000, alternatively members can pay an annual fee of HKD$50. The alumni unit has a very active unofficial Vancouver chapter.\n\nThe annual Watermelon Cup, held just after final exam in the summer, is a famous activity for graduates to compete in with current MFS students.\n\n"}

However, all physical devices are connected to a circuit through conductive leads and paths, which contain inherent, usually unwanted, inductance. This means that physical components contain some inductance in addition to their other properties.\n\nAn easy way to deal with these inherent inductances in circuit analysis is by using a lumped element model to express each physical component as a combination of an ideal component and a small inductor in series, the inductor having a value equal to the inductance present in the non-ideal, physical device.\n\nIdeally, the impedance of a capacitor falls with increasing frequency at 20 dB/decade. However, due partly to the inductive properties of the connections, and partly to non-ideal characteristics of the capacitor material, real capacitors also have inductive properties whose impedance \"rises\" with frequency at 20 dB/decade. At the \"resonance frequency\" the sum of both is minimal, above it the parasitic series inductance of the capacitor dominates.\n\n"}

{"id": "2272810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272810", "title": "Swisshelm Park (Pittsburgh)", "text": "Swisshelm Park (Pittsburgh)\n\nSwisshelm Park is a neighborhood located in the southeast corner of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is represented on Pittsburgh City Council by Corey O'Connor. Swisshelm Park houses PBF 19 Engine, and is covered by PBP Zone 4 and the Bureau of EMS Medic 7.\n\nA majority of Swisshelm Park is largely surrounded by Frick Park. Squirrel Hill's Nine Mile Run project borders it on the west; to the north is a section of the park adjacent to the Regent Square and the Parkway East. It also includes Duck Hollow, whose roads only connect to Squirrel Hill, in its borders.\n\nThe Sarah Jackson Black Community Center caters to the recreational and civic interests of the neighborhood. The Center also lists the names of the hundreds who fought in the Second World War from the small community, including seven who died in action. Swisshelm Park Parklet is the place for young children to play. The neighborhood adjoins Frick Park, Regent Square, the Squirrel Hill shopping district, and Edgewood Towne Centre.\n\nSwisshelm Park is full of suburban-style ranch and two story brick homes. It is also a tightly knit, family-oriented community. Its residents are active in its many recreational and youth programs. Because many city agencies require its employees to be city residents, the suburban character of the neighborhood has attracted many employees in the Department of Public Safety's Bureaus of Fire, Police and EMS, and the Pittsburgh Public School District.\n\nLong before it had a name, Swisshelm Park was home to the Susquehannock and Iroquois Indians. Like the adjacent borough of Swissvale, Pennsylvania, Swisshelm Park is named after the Swisshelm family, which moved to the area in 1800, although the land was also known to locals as Deniston Park or North Homestead. John Swisshelm (1752–1838), a veteran of Valley Forge, purchased a grist mill from William Pollock in 1808 and built a small log cabin in Nine Mile Run Hollow. The approximate location of the Swisshelm family homestead was just west of what is now S. Braddock Avenue and W. Swissvale Avenue, with the grist mill likely buried where the adjacent parkway now sits. The largely Scotch-Irish settlers in the area took their grain to Swisshelm's grist mill for grinding, which then made its way to Pittsburgh via the old Braddock Road. The grist mill and barn had crumbled and fallen by 1892, while the old Swisshelm house burned down in 1904.\n\nThe Swisshelm name gained fame and prestige from John Swisshelm's daughter-in-law, Jane Grey Cannon Swisshelm, who was a teacher, business owner, prominent feminist, publisher of the Pittsburgh Saturday Visiter - an anti-slavery newspaper - and an organizer of the Underground Railroad. In 1850 Swisshelm made history as the first woman in the Senate press gallery. It was Jane Swisshelm who gave the Borough of Swissvale its name and for whom Swisshelm Park was named.\n\nBefore the coal industry moved into Swisshelm Park, the area was mostly farmland. One prominent land-owner in the area was William. S. Haven - a close friend of Andrew Carnegie and one of wealthiest men in Pittsburgh at the time. Haven's homestead was adjoined by the Swisshelm residence at Nine Mile Run Hollow and occupied what is today the Edgewood Towne Centre. Haven's wife, Helen (Cooper), gained notoriety during the Civil War for her generous support for the Union troops at nearby Camp Copeland (in the Braddock Borough). She is said to have made daily trips to the camp and, at her own expense, provided the troops with home cooked meals while attending to the sick and dying. Other homesteads in the area were owned by Robert Milligan, John McKelvy, Samuel Deniston, Thomas Dickson, Alexander Gordon, J. S. Newmyer, and Col. William G. Hawkins - all of whom now have schools and streets named after them in Swissvale, Edgewood, and surrounding areas.\n\nThe building of the Pennsylvania Railroad through the area in 1852 encouraged industry. The Dickson-Stewart Coal Company began operations in 1866, attracting miners and their families. Swisshelm Park was incorporated into the City of Pittsburgh in 1868, relatively late in the city's history, when Jane Swisshelm was 53 years old. However, as late as the 1930s, residents noted that they were often not considered by others to be \"City residents\", given the rather isolated nature of the neighborhood. Even today, Swisshelm Park remains unknown to many Pittsburgh residents and is frequently mistaken as a suburb.\n\nA 35-acre portion of modern-day Swisshelm Park, including most of the area surrounding what is now Windermere Drive, was once owned by George Jackson, who died in 1854 and left the land to heirs. After the death of his last surviving children Mollie (or Mary) who died in 1889, and Sarah Black who died in 1912, a scandal erupted over the ownership of the land. Sarah left the land to a distant relative, Robert George Jackson, who was then sued in court by Alice Carey Jackson Cannon. Alice sued for partial ownership of the land on the grounds that she was the illegitimate daughter of Mollie Jackson and was therefore entitled to a portion of the estate. Although her true birth origins were kept secret from her through most of her childhood, Alice eventually learned that she was the child of Mollie and City Fire Bureau Chief, Samuel Evans. Having laid bare the secret origins of her birth and producing several witnesses who affirmed her account in court, the judge sided with Alice and awarded her half of the estate, then valued at 1.5 million dollars, in 1915. The former Jackson farm house still stands and the barn was converted to a community center still in use today, the Sarah Jackson Black Community Center. A city real estate map from 1939 shows that Robert George Jackson maintained possession of much of the land, which was divided into subplots and named, \"Ye Old Swissvale Farm\" development. In 1940, Robert George Jackson, a former resident of England, began putting the lots of land on Windermere Drive up for sale to raise money for British bomb refugees during the early stages of World War II. The lots ranged in value from $1,200 to $2,000 apiece, or approximately $20,000 to $32,000 today when adjusted for inflation. Jackson's connection to England might also explain the origins for the name of the street, as Windermere, the largest natural lake in England, has been a popular place in England for holidays and summer homes since 1846, when the first railroad to area was built. Most of the homes on Windermere Drive were built after the war in the early 1950s, with many of the homes supported by steel produced by the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company in nearby Etna, Pennsylvania.\n\nFor decades, a continuing concern of Swisshelm Park residents was the condition and reuse of the Duquesne slag area on the northwestern portion of the neighborhood. Although city planners had at one time considered damming the Nine Mile Run and creating a golf course and recreation area, Duquesne Steel Works purchased the area around 1923 and began dumping slag - which is a glass-like material left over after extraction of metals from the smelting or refining of ore. The slag was brought in from the steel mill in Rankin via train and from the Jones and Laughlin Mill via barge, and it slowly buried the park-like terrain and stream, the Nine Mile Run. By the time the dumping finally ceased, in 1972, a large area had been overtaken by two giant mountains of slag, said to be over 10 stories high, with the polluted stream bisecting the slag heaps. The stream eventually became the largest urban stream restoration in the United States carried out by the US Army Corps of Engineers. In 1996, the Nine Mile Run Greenway Project began at Carnegie Mellon University, which led to the incorporation of the Nine Mile Run Watershed Association, in 2001. In 1997, construction began to re-purpose the land into an upscale housing development, the Summerset at Frick Park residential development project. The master plan for this brownfield redevelopment project aims to make use of 40 acres along the western border of the Swisshelm Park neighborhood (between the western ends of Onodago Street and Goodman Street) to add an additional 217 new residential housing units and to make significant improvements to the adjacent Frick Park.\n\nDuck Hollow is an isolated neighborhood located within Swisshelm Park's boundaries. It is accessible to automobiles only via a connection to the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, traversing an old, weight-restricted bridge. It is bounded by the Monongahela River and railroad tracks, and by towering slag heaps across Nine Mile Run.\n\nSwisshelm Park has three land borders, two with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Regent Square to the northwest and Squirrel Hill South from the north down to the southwest. The other land border is with Swissvale to the east. Across the Monongahela River to the south, Swisshelm Park runs adjacent with Homestead and Munhall.\n\n"}

Armstrong grew up in County Durham in North East England. He first became interested in acting through Shakespeare productions at his grammar school. Since his career began in the early 1970s, he has played, in his words, \"the full spectrum of characters from the grotesque to musicals... I always play very colourful characters, often a bit crazy, despotic, psychotic\".\n\nHis numerous credits include several Charles Dickens adaptations and the eccentric ex-detective Brian Lane in \"New Tricks\". Armstrong is also an accomplished stage actor who spent nine years with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He originated the role of Thénardier in the London production of \"Les Misérables\" and he won an Olivier Award for playing the title role in \"\".\n\nBorn Alan Armstrong in Annfield Plain, County Durham, his father was a coal miner and both his parents were Methodist lay preachers. He attended Annfield Plain Junior School and then went on to Consett Grammar School, where a teacher inspired him to try acting. In the lower sixth, he played Petruchio in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" – a role he would later perform with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nHe took part in the National Youth Theatre summer school in 1964, but his background and his northern accent made him feel out of place. Armstrong auditioned for RADA but was not accepted. He instead studied fine art at Newcastle University. He found the course pretentious and felt that he did not fit in, and he was expelled after two years because he stopped attending classes.\n\nArmstrong had jobs with a bricklayer and as a gravedigger before he decided to try acting again. He started out by working as an assistant stage manager at the Cambridge Arts Theatre. He then went on to a Theatre in Education company affiliated with the Sheffield Repertory Theatre, and he performed in several Radio 4 dramas.\n\nArmstrong made his screen debut in the film \"Get Carter\" (1971). He wrote a letter to MGM, the studio making the film, upon learning that they were making the film in Newcastle and was invited to meet director Mike Hodges, who was keen to cast local actors.\n\nArmstrong has appeared in a number of films, although in this medium he has usually played supporting roles. In \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), he had a small role as one of the British troops at the Battle of Arnhem. He had a supporting role as the bandit leader Torquil in the 1983 fantasy film \"Krull\".\n\nHis first cinematic lead role was as Maxwell Randall, the titular vampire in Alan Clarke's snooker musical \"Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire\" (1987). Armstrong sang \"I Bite Back\".\n\nIn \"Patriot Games\" (1992), Armstrong played an SO-13 officer. In \"Braveheart\" (1995), he played the Scottish noble Mornay who betrayed William Wallace. He was the villainous Egyptian cult leader Baltus Hafez in \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001), and he portrayed Saint Peter with a Geordie accent in \"Millions\" (2004). He also had small roles as the High Constable in \"Sleepy Hollow\" (1999), Cardinal Jinette in \"Van Helsing\" (2004), Magistrate Fang in Roman Polanski's \"Oliver Twist\" (2005) and Uncle Garrow in \"Eragon\" (2006).\n\nArmstrong has played over 80 roles in television productions in the course of his career. During the 1970s, he appeared in various TV series, including episodes of \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, Porridge\" and \"The Sweeney\".\n\nHe was cast in two mini-series dealing with coal miners in North East England. He played Joe Gowlan in \"The Stars Look Down\" (1974) based on the novel by A. J. Cronin and he appeared in Ken Loach's \"Days of Hope\" (1975) set in his native County Durham. In a 2007 interview, Armstrong singled out \"Days of Hope\" as a favourite: \"I loved that because it was my own history and background that was being dramatised and, in a way, nothing gets better than that\".\n\nIn the comedy series \"A Sharp Intake of Breath\", he played a variety of characters who complicate the life of the main character played by David Jason. In 1977, he was the strict Deputy Headmaster in Willy Russell's \"Our Day Out\", a television play about a group of poor schoolchildren on a daytrip. He also starred in the 1981 Yorkshire Television drama \"Get Lost!\"\n\nArmstrong has portrayed characters from the works of Charles Dickens. He played Wackford Squeers and Mr. Wagstaff in the eight-hour Royal Shakespeare Company stage adaptation of \"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\" that was filmed for television in 1982. He has appeared in two versions of \"Oliver Twist\": the 1999 ITV mini-series as Agnes Fleming's father Captain Fleming and the 2005 Roman Polanski film as Magistrate Fang. He has had roles in four BBC Dickens adaptations, as Daniel Peggotty in \"David Copperfield\" (1999); as Inspector Bucket in \"Bleak House\" (2005); as Jeremiah and Ephraim Flintwinch in \"Little Dorrit\" (2008); and as Hiram Grewgious in \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" (2012). Armstrong has been a fan of Dickens since reading \"David Copperfield\" aloud in school. He particularly remembered Dan Peggotty's houseboat on the beach, and in order to play the role he turned down an offer from Clint Eastwood, with whom he had worked on \"White Hunter Black Heart\".\n\nIn the BBC drama series \"Our Friends in the North\" (1996), he played Austin Donohue, a character based on the politician T. Dan Smith. Armstrong portrayed 18th century politician Henry Fox in the BBC serial \"Aristocrats\" (1999). In the 2000 TV film \"\", he portrayed George Oldfield, the Assistant Chief Constable for Crime at West Yorkshire Police whose health deteriorated during the investigation as he received messages purportedly from the killer. He was nominated for a Royal Television Society award for his role in \"This Is Personal\".\n\nIn the second series of \"Bedtime\" (2002), he played a widower concerned about his son's suspicious behaviour. He and Brenda Blethyn co-starred in \"Between the Sheets\" (2003) as a frustrated married couple in sex therapy. In an adaptation of \"Carrie's War\", he played a strict man who reluctantly takes in two children evacuated to Wales during World War II.\n\nArmstrong is known for his role as Brian Lane in the BBC One series \"New Tricks\" about a group of former police detectives who help investigate unsolved and open cases for London's Metropolitan Police. The character of Brian Lane is an obsessive and socially inept recovering alcoholic who has a great capacity for remembering details of old cases and colleagues. In August 2012, Armstrong announced he would leave the show after the tenth series. The announcement followed comments by the cast in an interview with the \"Radio Times\" that criticised some of the series' writing, and which drew an angry rebuttal from the show's writer-director Julian Simpson.\n\nDuring the run of \"New Tricks\", Armstrong continued to take on other projects. He starred in the 2004 TV film \"When I'm 64\" about a lonely retired schoolteacher who starts a relationship with another man. He chose the role, despite his apprehension about filming a love scene with co-star Paul Freeman, because he thought it was a lovely and thought-provoking story. He also starred in \"The Girls Who Came to Stay\" (2006), about a British couple who take in two girls exposed to the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and \"\" (2008), as the husband of \"Clean-Up TV\" activist Mary Whitehouse.\n\nFor three series from 2009 to 2011, he played William Garrow's mentor John Southouse in the BBC period legal drama \"Garrow's Law\". In 2012, he played the Earl of Northumberland in the BBC2 adaptations of \"Henry IV, Parts I and II\". His son Joe Armstrong played Northumberland's son Hotspur. In the 2014 Showtime horror series \"Penny Dreadful\", Armstrong played Vincent Brand, an actor who gives Frankenstein's monster a job at the Grand Guignol. He guest starred in the 2014 Christmas special of \"Downton Abbey\", and took the role of Clifford Bentley in ITV cop drama Prime Suspect 1973.\n\nIn addition to his film and television work, Armstrong has acted in many theatre productions. One of his early roles was Billy Spencer in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" at the Royal Court Theatre directed by Lindsay Anderson in 1971. In 1975, he played Touchstone in \"As You Like It\" directed by Peter Gill at the Nottingham Playhouse.\n\nArmstrong spent nine years with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1979 to 1988. On tour and at the Donmar Warehouse in 1979–80, he played Dogberry in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and Azdak in \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\".\n\nIn 1981, Armstrong joined the cast of the eight-hour production of \"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\" as Wackford Squeers. The company went on tour to perform on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre. The play was filmed for television at the Old Vic Theatre in 1982.\n\nIn productions at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, and the Barbican Theatre in 1982–83, Armstrong played Trinculo in \"The Tempest\" and Petruchio in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" with Sinéad Cusack as Kate. In 1983, he played Ralph Trapdoor in \"The Roaring Girl\" starring Helen Mirren. He performed the roles of Leontes in \"The Winter's Tale\" and John Proctor in \"The Crucible\" on a national tour that included Christ Church, Spitalfields in 1984 and on tour to Poland in 1985. In 1985–86, he played Thersites in \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nIn the autumn of 1985, Armstrong took on what is perhaps his best-known stage role: Thénardier in the original London production of \"Les Misérables\". Thénardier and his wife, played by Susan Jane Tanner, are innkeepers whose shady practices are revealed in the song \"Master of the House.\" Armstrong described Thénardier as \"a gruesome and comic character.\"\n\nArmstrong was one of the first to be cast, along with fellow Royal Shakespeare Company members Sue Jane Tanner and Roger Allam. He was involved in fleshing out his role, particularly in the second act song \"Dog Eats Dog.\" He was surprised by the success of \"Les Misérables\" \"because it is different to other musicals. Different because it is a sung musical throughout and also a little operatic; I didn't think it would be very popular.\" He left the production after a year because he became bored with the repetition and wanted to move on to other things.\n\nHe sings on \"Original London Cast Recording\". He reprised the role, paired with Jenny Galloway as Mme. Thénardier, in \"Les Misérables - The Dream Cast in Concert\" at the Royal Albert Hall in October 1995, which was filmed and released on DVD. He also appeared in the 25th anniversary concert, though Matt Lucas performed the role of Thénardier.\n\nArmstrong received nominations in two categories for the 1985 Olivier Award: Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Musical for \"Les Misérables\" and Actor of the Year for \"The Crucible\" and \"The Winter's Tale\". In 1988, he was again nominated for the Olivier Award for the roles of Barabas in an RSC production of \"The Jew of Malta\" and the Captain in a National Theatre production of \"The Father\" by August Strindberg. The \"New York Times\" review of \"The Father\" said: \"At its imploding center is the superb actor Alun Armstrong... 'To eat or be eaten, that is the question,' says the captain. By evening's end, Mr. Armstrong seems to have been devoured alive by his inner demons...\"\n\nDuring the short run of the musical \"The Baker's Wife\" at the Phoenix Theatre in 1989–90, he played the role of the baker Aimable Castagnet. The production, directed by Trevor Nunn, received positive reviews but did not attract large audiences and closed after 56 performances. He was nominated for an Olivier Award for Outstanding Performance of the Year by an Actor in a Musical.\n\nArmstrong won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical in 1994 for his performance as Sweeney Todd in the 1993 London revival of the at the National Theatre. The play also won for Best Musical Revival and his co-star Julia McKenzie won Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nAt the Donmar Warehouse, Armstrong appeared as Albert Einstein in Terry Johnson's \"Insignificance\" in 1995, and he played Hamm in Samuel Beckett's \"Endgame\" in 1996. He starred as Willy Loman in a 1996–97 National Theatre production of \"Death of a Salesman\". In 1997–98, he appeared in a production of the comedy \"The Front Page\" directed by Sam Mendes at the Donmar Warehouse. The \"Independent\" review noted: \"As for Alun Armstrong, we don't meet him until late in the second of three acts but he dominates the entire evening. He barks, bleats and bellows across the stage, grabbing Hildy and the show by the scruff of the neck and hurtling through to a zinger of a climax.\"\n\nArmstrong took the lead role at short notice in Shelagh Stephenson's play \"Mappa Mundi\" in 2002, replacing Ian Holm who withdrew due to illness. In 2006, he returned to the stage to star in Trevor Nunn's production of \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\" at the National Theatre. At the Proms in 2012, he played Alfred Doolittle in a performance of \"My Fair Lady\" starring Annalene Beechey and Anthony Andrews. Armstrong stars in a 2014 production of Ionesco's black comedy \"Exit the King\" at the Theatre Royal, Bath's Ustinov Studio.\n\nArmstrong and his wife, Sue, have three sons: Tom, Joe (also an actor), and Dan. Father and son played older and younger versions of the same character in the 2010 BBC drama \"A Passionate Woman\", and they played Northumberland and his son Hotspur in the 2012 BBC adaptation of \"Henry IV\". Dan was a musician in the band Clock Opera. Armstrong appeared in the music video for their song \"The Lost Buoys\".\n\nIn July 2009, Armstrong was awarded two honorary degrees in recognition of his contributions to the arts. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia and an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Sunderland. The theatre at the Civic Hall in Stanley, County Durham, near Armstrong's hometown, was named after him in 2014.\n\nArmstrong is an avid supporter of AFC Wimbledon football club, as is his character in \"New Tricks\".\n\n\n"}

It plays in a manner similar to \"Operation Wolf\" and features a cameo appearance by Spider-Man. The Kingpin was the final boss in all versions except for Game Boy, which used Jigsaw.\n\nAlso in 1990, MicroProse produced a Punisher computer game for DOS and Amiga. It features three different modes of gameplay: driving the Punisher's \"Battle Van\", walking through NYC's streets and select buildings, and scuba diving.\n\nA Game Boy game with Jigsaw as the main villain and cameos from Spider-Man.\n\nA coin-operated arcade game titled \"The Punisher\" was released in 1993 by Capcom. The game is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up in the vein of Capcom's \"Final Fight\", where the player can control the Punisher or Nick Fury on their quest to kill The Kingpin, and would engage various foes in hand-to-hand combat, occasionally drawing firearms in lieu of melee combat. A home conversion developed by Sculptured Software was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.\n\nIn 2004, a violent Punisher action game designed for adult players was released by Volition, Inc. Players take control of the vigilante hero to track down criminals and make them pay for their deeds. The game's story is a loose mixture of the 2004 film, as well as the 2000 mini-series, \"Welcome Back, Frank\", written by Garth Ennis and pencilled by Steve Dillon, wherein the character has no aversion to committing acts of extreme violence. Thomas Jane, who portrayed the title role in the 2004 Punisher film also provides the voice of The Punisher in the game.\n\nA PlayStation 3 Punisher game was developed by Zen Studios and released by Sony Computer Entertainment on July 2, 2009, for PlayStation 3. The game includes many characters from the comics such as Nick Fury, Dum Dum Dugan, Outlaw, and Yelena Belova.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2272842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272842", "title": "Malaysia Cup", "text": "Malaysia Cup\n\nThe Malaysia Cup () is an annual association football tournament in Malaysia. The cup was first held in 1921. Even though it is the nation's oldest cup tournament, it is currently a secondary cup to the Malaysia FA Cup as the Malaysia FA Cup is the cup which is given the nation's slot for continental cup tournament. The competition was previously managed by Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) before it was transferred to Football Malaysia LLP (now known as Malaysian Football League (MFL)) in the 2016 season.\n\nA new format was introduced for 2016 season where only the best eleven teams from Malaysia Super League (MSL) and five others from Malaysia Premier League (MPL) qualified to play in Malaysia Cup that season where the final position for the qualification was determined after the least game of first round of MSL and MPL. After all 16 teams has been identified, the team will be divided into four groups which then will compete in the tournament for the cup.\n\nThe Malaysia Cup was played at the end of each year's football season until the 2016 season where it was changed to be played near the end of the football season in order to promote competitive league within Malaysian football league.\n\nThe current title holder is Johor Darul Ta'zim, who won the 2019 edition.\n\nThe Piala Malaysia is one of Asia’s longest-running football competitions. Established in 1921, it was known as the Malaya Cup from 1921 to 1967, after the donation of a trophy from the British Royal Navy ship H.M.S. Malaya. The tournament was renamed the Piala Malaysia in 1967. For much of its history, the Cup was contested by Malaysian state teams, military teams as well as foreign invitees Singapore and Brunei. Malaysian club teams were allowed entry into the competition from 2000.\n\nIn January 1921, the British Royal Navy battleship H.M.S. Malaya called at Port Swettenham (now Port Klang), Singapore, Malacca, Penang and Port Dickson. During its stay, the crew competed in friendly matches in football, rugby, hockey, sailing and golf against local clubs.\n\nThree months later, the Chief Secretary of the Federated Malay States government received a letter from Captain H. T. Buller of H.M.S. Malaya, which offered two cups to be competed for in football and rugby as tokens of their gratitude for the reception they received in Malaya. The offer was accepted and various club representatives met to organise the tournament.\n\nA Malaya Cup committee was set up and it was decided to run the football competition in northern and southern sections. The first tournament were entrusted to be run by the Selangor Club. The first ever Malaya Cup match was played on 20 August 1921, with Selangor defeating Penang 5–1 in front of an estimated crowd of 5,000 in Kuala Lumpur. The inaugural tournament were played by six teams and won by Singapore where each Singapore players received a gold badge for their victory.\n\nThe popularity of the tournament was already apparent in its early years where in 1923, a newspaper described it as “by far the greatest sporting event of the year (in Malaya)”. The final was played outside Kuala Lumpur for the first time in 1925, when Singapore defeated Selangor 2–1 at the Anson Road Stadium. Singapore also maintained a record of appearing in every Malaya Cup final from the first in 1921 to 1941, when the competition was disrupted by World War II.\n\nIn September 1926, representatives from the football associations of Singapore, Selangor, Perak, Negri Sembilan and Malacca agreed to form a Malayan Football Association (MFA). The MFA was based in Kuala Lumpur, with John Sime of Singapore as its first president, and was represented on the Malaya Cup committee which organised the competition. The MFA saw little activity until 1932, when it was revived and reformed as the Football Association of Malaya (FAM). The FAM also took control of the organisation of the Malaya Cup from its founding committee. The same year, the British Services were allowed to enter their own teams, joining Kedah and Johor which were both in the competition by 1930.\n\nThe Malaya Cup resumed in 1948, and the post-war era saw Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis enter the competition. In 1957, the final was played for the first time at the newly constructed Merdeka Stadium. The majority of the finals would be held at the Merdeka Stadium until the 1990s.\n\nIn 1959, the Malaya Cup departed from the traditional one round tournament to a two-round home and away format in three zones, East, South and North.\n\nIn 1967, the H. M. S. Malaya Cup was retired and replaced with a new trophy, the Piala Malaysia, in line with political developments and since then the competition has been known as the Piala Malaysia. The old Malaya Cup now resides at the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWhere previous tournaments had been segmented into geographical zones, the 1979 edition saw every team play each other in a 17-team competition. New entries were Federal Territory (later renamed Kuala Lumpur), the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, as well as the independent sultanate of Brunei. A one-round league competition was introduced in Malaysia in 1979. The top four teams at the end of the league will face off in two semi-finals before the winners made it to the finals. In 1981, the quarter-finals stage were introduced. When the league began, it was intended primarily as a qualifying tournament for the Piala Malaysia.\n\nHowever, only in 1982, the league trophy was awarded to the winners of the league stage. Since then, the Piala Malaysia has been held after the conclusion of the league each year, with only the best-performing teams in the league qualifying for the Piala Malaysia.\n\nIn 2003, MPPJ FC became the first club and a non state team to win the cup. Prior to that year, the two teams which made the final had always been representative sides of the regional Football Associations, or military teams.\n\nTeams representing two of Malaysia's neighbouring countries have been involved in the competition. Brunei won the cup in 1999 and continue to be involved though in recent years they have been represented by the club side DPMM FC, whereas initially their team was organised by the Football Association of Brunei. Singapore used to enter a team organised by the Football Association of Singapore. Their team won the cup 24 times and are the second most successful side in the competition's history after Selangor. However, after their last win in 1994, Singapore withdrew from the competition following a dispute with the Football Association of Malaysia over gate receipts and have not been involved since. In 2011, Football Association of Singapore announced that Singapore would be back to join the Piala Malaysia in 2012. On 5 December 2011, Football Association of Singapore had unveiled the new squad list and line up planned for the 2012 edition of Piala Malaysia where LIONSXII was sent to compete.\n\nIn 2015, Football Malaysia Limited Liability Partnership (FMLLP) was created in the course of privatisation of the Malaysian football league system. The partnership saw all 24 teams of Liga Super and Liga Premier including FAM as the Managing Partner and MP & Silva as a special partner (FAM's global media and commercial advisor) to become stakeholders in the company. FMLLP owns, operates and runs five entities in Malaysian football under its jurisdiction, which include Liga Super, the Liga Premier, the Piala FA, the Piala Malaysia and the Piala Sumbangsih. It aims to transform and move Malaysian football forward.\n\nBelow are the list of champions and finalists for Piala Malaysia since its inception in 1921.\n\n"}

Tolkien's inaugural O'Donnell Memorial Lecture of October 21, 1955. The lecture sheds light on Tolkien's conceptions of the connections of race, ethnicity, and language.\n\nIt was first published in \"Angles and Britons\" in 1963, and then was later republished in \"The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays\".\n\nTolkien begins with an overview of the terms \"British\", \"Celtic\", \"Germanic\", \"Saxon\", \"English\" and \"Welsh\", explaining the last term's etymology in \"walha\".\n\nTolkien also addresses the historical language contact between English and Welsh since the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, including Welsh loanwords and substrate influence found in English, and conversely English loanwords in Welsh. Comparing the Germanic \"i\"-mutation and the Celtic affection, Tolkien says:\n\nIn the final part of the lecture, Tolkien explores the concept of phonaesthetics, citing the phrase \"cellar door\" as a recognized beautiful-sounding phrase in English, adding that to his own taste, in Welsh \"\"cellar doors\" are extraordinarily frequent\". Tolkien describes the working of phonaesthetics inherent in the moment of association of sound and meaning:\n\nTolkien alludes to his view that such tastes are inherited, \"an aspect in linguistic terms of our individual natures. And since these are largely historical products, the predilections must be so too.\" To refer to such an inherited taste of language, Tolkien introduces the term \"native tongue\" as opposed to \"cradle tongue\".\n\nTolkien notes in his lecture that \"Most English-speaking people … will admit that 'cellar door' is beautiful, especially if dissociated from its sense and from its spelling. More beautiful than, say, 'sky', and far more beautiful than 'beautiful' … Well then, in Welsh, for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent\". This heavy interest in and appreciation of Welsh influenced his own languages, notably his elvish languages like Sindarin and Quenya.\n\nThis lecture is considered Tolkien's \"last major learned work\". There were several important aspects to it: firstly, it \"includes a valuable contribution to the study of the place of Britons in Anglo-Saxon England\", secondly, a warning against racial theories, thirdly, a hypothesis of \"inborn\" linguistic tastes which then leads into a discussion of his own views of aesthetics in language, and finally, it provided a (correct) hypothesis on the origins of the word \"w(e)alh\", which in turn provided an explanation of what happened to Celtic when the Anglo-Saxons invaded.\n\n"}

It is also one of the largest shopping malls in the United States. The mall is located approximately 27 miles from the Chicago Loop and attracts more than 27 million visitors each year. The mall features 234 stores and is anchored by J.C. Penney, Lord & Taylor, Macy's (formerly Marshall Field's), Nordstrom and the country's largest Sears store at , though in 2015, a portion of the second level was subleased to Level 257, a Pac Man-themed restaurant. It also has 8 other restaurants which are Red Robin, Uncle Julio’s, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Level 257, Panda Express, The Cheesecake Factory, Kinfork BBQ, and Texas de Brazil.\n\nThe mall was originally developed by Taubman Centers, which later sold the mall to CalPERS, Miller Capital Advisory, and GM Pension Trusts. Taubman continued to manage the mall until December 31, 2012, when GM Pension Trusts sold its stake in the mall to Simon Property Group, which took over management effective January 1, 2013.\n\nConstruction began on Woodfield Mall in July 1969 and the mall opened on September 9, 1971, with 59 stores, growing to 189 stores with 1.9 million retail square feet by 1973, along with a large 135-foot-tall water tower to supply water to the mall and the nearby village. It was the largest mall in the United States at the time of its opening. It is the 12th-largest mall in the U.S. to this date. It is currently the largest mall in the Chicago metropolitan area, with 234 stores and restaurants. Woodfield is part of a group of three malls located in Schaumburg, Illinois, along with Woodfield Village Green, and The Streets of Woodfield. Woodfield is a major tourist destination in the state of Illinois. In 2000, Chicago's visitors voted Woodfield Mall as their favorite suburban attraction.\n\nWoodfield Mall is named after former Sears board chairman General Robert E. Wood and Marshall Field and Company founder Marshall Field. It debuted on September 9, 1971, on of prairie land, previously occupied by farms, cows, and a village tavern. Singer Carol Lawrence, actor Vincent Price, and two marching bands entertained at the debut. At the time of its opening, it claimed to be the world's largest shopping center. By the end of September 1971, another 28 stores and restaurants had opened and that first business year finished with 138 specialty retailers. Many of those retailers—Johnston & Murphy, Stride Rite, and New York & Company (formerly Lerner New York) are still at Woodfield Mall today.\n\nOriginally of retail space, the GLA of the mall today is . This makes it the fifth largest shopping mall in the U.S., ninth largest in terms of shopping area. The mall contains a total of 234 stores.. \n\nIn 1973, a new Lord & Taylor wing was constructed, along with 50 additional new retailers. \n\nSbarro opened in 1984 and A&W opened in 1985. The 5-plex opened for business on July 30, 1971. The mall also had a pair of free-standing twin cinemas, Woodfield Theatres 1 & 2 and Woodfield Theatres 3 & 4, at the perimeter of the mall near Golf Road. The 1 & 2 was opened with 2 G-rated films, including a Disney movie, and the 3 & 4 later opened; both were closed and demolished in the 1990s, replaced by additional retail. The Woodfield Mall Cinemas 5-plex closed in 2000, and was last operated by Cineplex Odeon Corporation. After it closed, the space was turned into a theme restaurant called Mars 2112, which was very short-lived. The former theater area was converted into an Improv Comedy Club in 2006, the first location in Illinois. The Loews Theatres at the Streets of Woodfield, an outdoor shopping center next to Woodfield Mall, made its debut as a 20-screener on December 10, 1999. The Streets of Woodfield was built between 1999 and 2000, replacing another indoor mall, One Schaumburg Place, which opened in 1991. The Streets of Woodfield featured Carson's, Dick's Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan's), and GameWorks. The freestanding Loews Theatres complex was eventually rebranded by the AMC Theatres chain in 2016. \n\nIn 1994, Panera Bread and Hooters opened northwest of the mall. In celebration of its 20th anniversary in 1991, Woodfield added 23 more stores, including The Disney Store, and then in 1995, Woodfield grew again with a $110 million wing that included 50 new specialty stores. Rainforest Cafe was added to the mall in October of that same year. In 1996, the mall received a three-level Nordstrom and a larger replacement Lord & Taylor. Of these new-for-1995 stores, nearly 40 were flagship concepts and designs, with about 27 of them the largest in their chains. In 1997, Joe's Crab Shack opened on the northeast edge of the mall, but it was one of 41 locations in the chain to close in 2017. IKEA opened a three-story location across from Woodfield Mall on November 18, 1998.\n\nWhile all of this expansion continued at Woodfield Mall, the surrounding village of Schaumburg grew as well. In 1970, the population was 19,000; in 1980, it mushroomed to 55,000; and, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Schaumburg had over 75,000 people in 2000. Schaumburg Mayor Al Larson observed that, \"Woodfield established a focal point for development throughout all of the northwest suburbs. Without Woodfield, we wouldn't have office towers in Itasca or corporate development in Hoffman Estates.\"\n\nIn 1995, Woodfield Associates commissioned a brand new $128,000 paint job for the mall water tower. Woodfield paid an additional $97,000 for the exterior painting. Both the interiors and exteriors of the water tower were completely repainted. The tower was completely drained of water before the new paint job could be applied. Afterwards, the interior and exterior of the tower were thoroughly cleaned and rust spots were treated properly. The painting of the interior began after the cleaning and treatment, followed by the painting of the exterior. For the exterior, Woodfield chose a base layer of light gray, along with four continuous, teal “W”s ( for Woodfield ) around the bowl of the tower. The entire painting process took around 350 gallons of paint.\n\nIn 2004, the fountains, the waterfall and the aquariums were removed from the mall. The Woodfield “Fish Music” however, was only the beginning for Suzanne Ciani. As a subtle pleasure, the underwater sounds of Ms. Ciani’s music played in a continuous loop for visitors who explored the tunnel and the aquariums. Her contribution was nothing less than first class.\n\nIn 2005, only ten years after the water tower received a new look, it was again repainted and has not been repainted since. The current scheme includes small, black text reading \"Woodfield Mall\" with large white clouds in the background, along with a representation of Schaumburg's skyscrapers in blue right below the text. Blue sky can be seen above the clouds, covering the very top of the bowl.\n\nThe mall is a highly visited tourist destination in the Chicago metropolitan area, with about 27 million annual visitors. Woodfield is often used as a test market for retailers; a recent example was the 2004 opening (and nationwide debut) of Ruehl No.925 by clothier Abercrombie & Fitch.\n\nOn September 20, 2019 a black SUV drove through the mall, with little reported casualties.\n\nIn 2001, Red Robin opened in the Lord & Taylor wing and The Cheesecake Factory opened in the JCPenney wing. That same year, Olive Garden opened on the Northeast Corner outside the mall. \n\nOn August 24, 2001, an Apple Store opened in the Lord & Taylor Wing.\n\nOn September 18, 2002, Hot Topic opened on the 2nd Floor in the JCPenney wing, six days after Orland Square Mall in Orland Park opened.\n\nIn September 2006, the Marshall Field's location at the mall was renamed Macy's after the acquisition of Marshall Field's.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, Woodfield renovated their McDonald's, which opened in 2000. Also, that same year, Pink by Victoria's Secret opened to the public. On October 1, 2012, LongHorn Steakhouse opened on the northeast corner outside of the mall.\n\nIn 2013, a Forever 21 and a two-story H&M opened in the Sears Wing. A Microsoft Store also opened in the Lord & Taylor Wing that same year.\n\nIn July 2014, lululemon and Arhaus opened in the Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom Wings.\nIn November of that same year, Columbia Sportswear opened near Lord & Taylor.\n\nIn 2015, a portion of the second level of Sears was subleased to Level 257, a Pac Man-themed restaurant featuring a bowling alley, an arcade and pinball machines. Along with a major renovation, Zara, Timberland, Kids Foot Locker and rue21 opened. Kinfork BBQ opened in December between Nordstrom and JCPenney; it closed in 2019. \n\nIn 2016, Uncle Julio’s officially opened in the JCPenney wing, replacing Ruby Tuesday, which closed in 2012. \n\nIn 2017, Victoria's Secret was substantially remodeled.\n\nIn 2018, a large food court, known as the \"Dining Pavilion,\" opened on the second floor in the east court opposite of the main mall entrance. It features Chipotle Mexican Grill, Blaze Pizza, and more. It replaced two level 2 stores: F.Y.E. (For Your Entertainment), which moved to a smaller location on the lower level near Dunkin' Donuts, and A'GACI ladies' wear. A year before the opening of the Dining Pavilion, a 4th elevator was added.\n\nIn June 2018, Blocks To Bricks, which is a hybrid between a store and museum dedicated to Legos and other construction toys, opened to customers.\n\nOn October 26, 2018, Uniqlo, which is a Japanese clothing chain, opened in the JCPenney wing. Also, a salon was added in the Sears wing near Jimmy John's.\n\nIn November 2018, it was announced that the mall would be open 29 hours straight.\n\nIn December 19, 2019, it was announced that the Rainforest Cafe in Woodfield Mall is scheduled to close on January 1, 2020 due to the expiration of its lease. It will be replaced by the Peppa Pig World of Play amusement center.\n\nIn 1987, Tiffany Darwish performed for 3 consecutive days.\n\nIn 2013, Weezer played at Woodfield Mall at the grand opening of the Microsoft Store. \n\nIn the 1990s, Woodfield closed the \"underground\" food court in the main courtyard of the mall. At first it closed off the opening to the lower eating area and stairway. The removal left a large open area that for a few years you could see the tile outlining the former opening to the food court below. This floor outline was eliminated in renovating the courtyard.\n\nIn January 2015, Woodfield planned and announced a $13.8 million renovation. The makeover consisted of an updated grand court, including the removal of the brick fixtures and leveling out many multi-leveled sections of floor. The renovation also includes new flooring for both lower and upper levels, replacing two existing elevators, and adding one new elevator. The renovation was predicted to be finished by the end of the year.\n\nIn 2017, Woodfield planned and announced a $14 million renovation to introduce a new food court in the Sears wing. The food court introduced a seating area containing 820 seats for quality fast-casual dining restaurants such as Chipotle, Charley's Philly Steak, Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza, and more. \n\nOn September 20, 2019, at around 2:30 PM CDT, a man drove a mid-2000s black Chevrolet TrailBlazer LT through an entrance door of Sears and began driving through the store and into the main concourse of the mall, crashing into kiosks, Clarks, International Diamond Company, and multiple other stores, seemingly targeting Forever 21 and other adjacent stores. The driver was taken into custody by responding police near the center of the mall's first level without further incident. The identity of the suspect was not immediately released. No injuries were reported, but the mall was temporarily on lockdown due to the incident as well as concurrent, but unfounded, reports of an active shooter. The mall was evacuated about one hour after the incident.\n\nThe man, later identified as Javier Garcia of Palatine, Illinois, was charged with terrorism as a result of the incident; he appeared in court on September 29, 2019, and was denied bond. He appeared in court again on October 1, 2019, and is due back in court on January 27, 2020. Garcia's family spoke out arguing that Javier is not a terrorist and that he has schizophrenia, though a police investigation shows evidence that Garcia's attack was premeditated, with investigators releasing - in part - that Garcia \"searched 'Woodfield mall,' the aerial view of the mall and mall premises 124 times between 9/19/19 at 14:38 and 9/20/19 at 12:55.\" Garcia has since also been charged with an unrelated arson case from September 8, 2019, in his hometown of Palatine.\n\nPace\n\n\n\n"}

This means that the antisolar point lies above the horizon when the Sun is below it, and vice versa. On a sunny day, the antisolar point can be easily found; it is located within the shadow of the observer's head. Like the zenith and nadir, the antisolar point is not fixed in three-dimensional space, but is defined relative to the observer. Each observer has an antisolar point that moves as the observer changes position.\n\nThe antisolar point forms the geometric center of several optical phenomena, including subhorizon haloes, rainbows, glories, the Brocken spectre, and heiligenschein. Occasionally, around sunset or sunrise, anticrepuscular rays appear to converge toward the antisolar point near the horizon. However, this is an optical illusion caused by perspective; in reality, the \"rays\" (i.e. bands of shadow) run near-parallel to each other.\n\nAlso around the antisolar point, the gegenschein is often visible in a moonless night sky away from city lights, arising from the backscatter of sunlight by interplanetary dust. In astronomy, the full Moon or a planet in opposition lies near the antisolar point. During a total lunar eclipse, the full Moon enters the umbra of Earth's shadow, which the planet casts onto its atmosphere, into space, and toward the antisolar point.\n\nThe anthelic point is often used as a synonym for the antisolar point, but the two should be differentiated.\nWhile the antisolar point is directly opposite the sun, always below the horizon when the sun is up, the anthelic point is opposite but at the same elevation as the sun, and is therefore located on the parhelic circle. There are several halo phenomena that are centered on or converge on the anthelic point, such as the anthelion, Wegener arcs, Tricker arcs and the parhelic circle itself.\n"}

This allowed for the creation of the local government or city council. The act was transferred onto the succeeding governments of Ontario in 1840 and 1867. The incorporation remained in effect throughout Toronto's mergers with other cities and towns within southern York County until the creation of Metropolitan Toronto in 1954.\n\nThe \"Metropolitan Toronto Act\" was a provincial act passed on April 2, 1953 to co-ordinate the services in the various municipalities of southern York County. The southern municipalities, being East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Leaside, Long Branch, Mimico, New Toronto, North York, Scarborough, Swansea, Toronto, Weston, and York, were separated from York County and organized under a new regional federation, titled the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.\n\nThe \"Act\" went into effect on April 15, 1953, and Metro's taxation and legislative powers took effect on January 1, 1954. The federation was governed by a council made up of representatives of the member municipalities and a chairman to oversee the council. The first chairman was Fred Gardiner, appointed by the Province of Ontario. Subsequent chairmen were selected by Council itself, and later directly elected.\n\nOn January 1, 1967, seven of the thirteen municipalities were absorbed into the six remaining federation members, being Toronto, Etobicoke, North York, East York, York, and Scarborough. The \"Metropolitan Toronto Act\" was revised in 1990 and finally repealed in 1997 with the amalgamation of the Metro Toronto government and the governments of the municipalities within.\n\nIn 1997, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario enacted a law to amalgamate the Metro Toronto government and the six municipalities within the Metro Toronto boundaries into an enlarged City of Toronto. A referendum in the six constituent municipalities showed residents opposed the merger by more than 3:1. However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments. The governing Progressive Conservatives could thus move forward with the merger notwithstanding the referendum. The \"Act\" took effect on January 1, 1998.\n\nOn December 14, 2005, the first reading of Bill 53 was given in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Also known as the \"Stronger City of Toronto for a Stronger Ontario Act, 2005\", it enacts the new \"City of Toronto Act, 2005\", as well as amends and repeals various public acts related to Toronto, and repeals various private acts also related to the city. The bill received its second reading on April 10, 2006, and was referred to the Standing Committee on General Government, which returned it to the Legislature on May 30, 2006. On June 12, 2006, the bill received its third reading and royal assent after a 58–20 vote.\n\nThis law permitted the Toronto government to enter into agreements with other governments, and increased the scope for the city government to raise revenue. Tax powers in Canada are defined by the constitution and restrict certain powers of direct taxation only to the federal government.\n\n\n"}

Both of his parents were amateur musicians. His father, who played the violin and cello, was his first teacher. His older brother Sigmund was also musically talented, and their little sister, Sophie (born January 1908) was the piano prodigy in the family. Their father decided to move the family to Vienna in 1907 for Sigmund to start his professional career there. At the age of nine, Emanuel received lessons from Friedrich Buxbaum, principal cello of the Vienna Philharmonic, and then studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna. In February 1914, the eleven-year-old prodigy made his concert debut, playing Joseph Haydn's Cello Concerto in D major with the Vienna Philharmonic under Felix Weingartner.\n\nIn 1917, Feuermann went to Leipzig to study with legendary cellist Julius Klengel. In 1919 cellist Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Grützmacher (1866–1919), the nephew of Friedrich Wilhelm Grützmacher, died, and Klengel recommended Feuermann for Grützmacher's position at the Gürzenich Conservatory in Cologne. He was also appointed principal cellist of the Gürzenich Orchestra, by its conductor (who was also the conservatory director), Hermann Abendroth. Feuermann became cellist of the Bram Elderling Quartet. At that time, he also joined a short-lived piano trio with his brother and pianist-conductor Bruno Walter. In 1929, Feuermann became professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin and taught there for the next four years. He performed during this time with violinists Carl Flesch, Szymon Goldberg, Joseph Wolfsthal and composer Paul Hindemith, the latter playing viola in a string trio with Feuermann and Wolfsthal (later Goldberg; see below). He also performed with Jascha Heifetz, William Primrose and Arthur Rubinstein.\n\nOn April 3, 1933, the newly installed Nazi regime dismissed him from his position at the Berlin Conservatory due to his Jewish heritage. He moved to London along with Goldberg and Hindemith, where the trio recorded Beethoven's early Serenade in D major for string trio, Op. 8, and a string trio by Hindemith, for Columbia Records. He toured Japan and the United States then returned to London, where he married Eva Reifenberg (a cousin of Katja Andy) in 1935, with whom he had a daughter, Monica. Following the premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Cello Concerto under Sir Thomas Beecham he lived for some time in Zürich, but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the 1938 Anschluss. Violinist Bronisław Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to British Palestine. From there they moved to the United States later that year.\n\nHe taught privately, and at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, until his death. During these years he collaborated with the pianist Vladimir Sokoloff. Among his notable pupils were Bernard Greenhouse, Suzette Forgues Halasz, Robert Lamarchina, Alan Shulman, David Soyer and August Wenzinger. In the United States, he made several celebrated chamber-music recordings with Heifetz, Rubinstein and others. His relationship with Hindemith suffered when the latter chose Gregor Piatigorsky to premiere his Cello Concerto.\n\nFeuermann died in New York City due to complications during surgery on May 25, 1942, at the age of 39.\n\nKlengel wrote of Feuermann, \"Of all those who have been entrusted to my guardianship, there has never been such a talent...our divinely favoured artist and lovable young man.\" Heifetz declared that talent like Feuermann's comes once every one hundred years. Indeed, after Feuermann's untimely death it took seven years for Heifetz to collaborate with another cellist, Gregor Piatigorsky.\n\nArtur Rubinstein was equally emphatic: \"He became for me the greatest cellist of all times, because I did hear Pablo Casals at his best. He (Casals) had everything in the world, but he never reached the musicianship of Feuermann. And this is a declaration.\" If one can grade (approximately) music playing into technical, artistic, philosophical and divine levels, in his full maturity, Feuermann had touched on the philosophical level. Given enough time, he might touch on the divine level on playing cello. His untimely death never allowed him to reach there. Both Heifetz and Rubinstein were longtime trio partners with Feuermann. During his first tour of the United States in 1935–36, Feuermann reaped enthusiastic reviews from music critics. After a 1938 Proms performance in London, critic Reid Steward of The Strad wrote \"I do not think there can any longer be doubt that Feuermann is the greatest living cellist, Casals alone excepted...\"\n\nThe honorary pallbearers at his funeral included some of the greatest musicians of the time: pianists Rudolf Serkin and Artur Schnabel, violinists Mischa Elman and Bronisław Huberman, and conductors George Szell, Eugene Ormandy and Arturo Toscanini. During the procession Toscanini broke down crying, exclaiming, \"This is murder!\" In 1954, when asked which cellists he particularly admired, Casals said, \"What a great artist Feuermann was! His early death was a great loss to music.\"\n\nIn 1929, Feuermann purchased a cello made by David Tecchler in Rome in 1741. From 1932, he also owned an instrument made by Venetian master luthier Domenico Montagnana in 1735. This instrument, known as the Feuermann cello, is presently in the hands of a Swiss cellist and collector. It was larger and wider than the Tecchler.\n\nFeuermann later owned the De Munck Stradivarius cello of 1730. It was previously on extended loan from the Nippon Foundation to cellist Steven Isserlis from 1998 to 2011, and it is currently on loan to Danjulo Ishizaka since 2014.\n\nFeuermann is also said to have owned and played a Gofriller cello later owned by American cellist Joseph Schuster; from Schuster, it was passed on to Jascha Silberstein.\n\nFeuermann is featured on recordings including:\n\n\n"}

He is one of the very few players to have played for both Newcastle United and Sunderland.\n\nElliott began his career with his hometown club in 1989 as a youth trainee and offered a professional contract just two years later. He was one of a number of youngsters who had been blooded by the Magpies for first team action by Ossie Ardiles in 1991–92, others included Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Lee Clark. He had made his debut the previous season, in a 3–0 league defeat by Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park on 12 March 1991.\n\nHe found opportunities hard to come by in his early years at Newcastle, this mainly being due to the form of regular left-back and crowd favourite John Beresford, a signing from Portsmouth in 1992. However, he was still very much considered to be a key part of the first team squad and one to develop by the manager at the time Kevin Keegan. In the season of 1993–94, he was capped by the England U21 team along with fellow Geordie Lee Clark, whilst also making a total of 15 appearances in the Premier League, his first in the top flight.\n\n1994–95 saw him score his first ever Newcastle goal as a substitute in the opening day fixture against top-flight new boys Leicester City at Filbert Street. He was also on the mark in the home against Leeds United towards the latter end of that season, a season which he temporarily became the club's first choice left-back in the final few months. It looked as if he would be out of the exit door at Newcastle in 1995–96 as he made just six league appearances. Blackburn Rovers showed strong interest in signing him but he remained with the Black and White stripes in order to fight for a first team place.\n\nIn contrast 1996–97 was probably his best ever season in a Newcastle jersey, he scored seven goals as the Magpies finished as the runners-up to eventual champions Manchester United, a club whom Elliott had previously trialled with as a schoolboy. The most memorable of his seven goals was the winner in a 1–0 win against Arsenal at Highbury.\n\nKeegan's managerial departure from Newcastle also yielded the end of Elliott's first spell with his boyhood club. New manager Kenny Dalglish accepted a bid of around £2.5 million for Elliott from Division One champions Bolton Wanderers in July 1997, becoming their record signing at the time. Bolton had, at the time, moved to the new 25,000 all-seater Reebok Stadium arena and this looked to be a new start for Elliott as he faced the prospect of more regular first team football alongside his former Newcastle teammates Alan Thompson, Peter Beardsley and Franz Carr, all of whom were also on Bolton's books at that time.\n\nHowever disaster struck in the first ever match at the Reebok Stadium against Everton, just 30 minutes into the game Elliott landed awkwardly following a challenge by Toffees full back Tony Thomas and was stretchered off with a double fracture to his leg. Understandably Elliott was to miss the rest of that season and part of the next season, in a cruel twist of fate. Bolton had been relegated from the Premiership in his absence following an end of season drama at Chelsea.\n\nIn October 1998, Elliott's luck was to change for the better, he was named in midfield for Bolton's League Cup clash away to Norwich City for his first game since that fateful first night at the Reebok Stadium. He managed to get on the scoresheet at Carrow Road as Bolton advanced to the next round of the competition and later played in a handful of league matches thereafter to boost his fitness levels further.\n\nThe end of that season saw Bolton qualify for the divisions Play-Offs, and they advanced to the final after a tricky semi-final against Ipswich Town over two legs. Elliott was to play at Wembley Stadium with Bolton in the final against Watford, but the club lost the game by two goals to nil. A year later Elliott reached three semi-finals with Bolton, who were now managed by Sam Allardyce. However, on each occasion these ended in defeat, with the Play Off match against Ipswich proving difficult for Elliott as he was sent off for throwing Ipswich forward David Johnson to the ground in what was a highly charged game against the Suffolk club.\n\nThroughout his career at Bolton he was often touted for a possible return to the Premiership with other clubs because he was one of the club's highest paid and most experienced players. However, to his credit, he wanted to help Bolton back into the Premier League, and in his final season he did just that as the club won the 2001 Play Off Final against Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff having finished behind the other two promoted teams Fulham and Blackburn Rovers.\n\nJust two days after that play-off success his contract expired with Bolton and he completed a dream return to Newcastle on a Bosman transfer.\n\nInitially, Elliott was used as a backup player in Newcastle's squad for the 2001–02 season, however he then went on to have limited chances in the 2002–03 season and then failed to make any first team appearances at all during the 2003–04 season.\nHowever, by the 2004–05 season, injuries to the squad merited Elliott a recall to the first team football, he went on the make 17 appearances that season and scored one goal against Manchester City. For season 2005/06 he remained in Newcastle's first team squad albeit not as a first choice. With injuries occurring, he played numerous games in central defence and at left back but the younger academy graduate Peter Ramage was often preferred over Elliott's experience as the season progressed. He was released in the following summer.\n\nFollowing his release, Elliott trained with Newcastle's rivals Sunderland following an unsuccessful trial with Leeds United. With Sunderland short on left back's, Elliott signed a one-month contract prior to the start of the 06/07 Football League Championship season, and made his debut in the 3–1 defeat to Southend United at Roots Hall on 19 August 2006. In a match against Stoke City in 2006 he broke the leg of Rory Delap who at the time was on loan at Stoke from Sunderland.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful spell at the Stadium of Light, Elliott was transferred to Leeds United, who originally rejected his services six months previously. Elliott confirmed after his Leeds debut in the 2–1 victory over Coventry City on 1 January 2007 that his transfer was permanent, not a loan and his contract with the club was to expire at the end of the season, in May 2007. Elliot was released from Leeds at the end of the 2006–07 season having only made 7 appearances for the club.\n\nAfter leaving Leeds, Elliott joined Hartlepool United in July 2007. Elliott was sent off against Doncaster Rovers on 18 August 2007 on his home debut for two yellow cards by referee Mike Dean.\n\nIn July 2008, Elliott went back to Newcastle for his third spell at the club and become the new assistant Fitness and Conditioning coach for the club to work under senior fitness coach Mark Hulse.\n\nIn June 2009, Elliott left Newcastle United due to the turmoil regarding the take over of the club.\n\nSince 2009, Elliott has worked with the US Soccer Federation in the position of Youth National Team Performance Expert (Male and Female).\n\nElliott was a student at Gosforth High School and is a graduate of Northumbria University.\n\nHe regularly takes his two young sons to watch Newcastle United matches from the club's executive box.\n\nRobbie with his friend Phil Gray are currently raising funds for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. In 2012 Elliott, along with Joey Barton, a former Newcastle United midfielder, sponsored a shirt each from Newcastle United's women's team. Elliot sponsored the number three shirt, the number he wore in the men's side.\n\n"}

Saint Paul's College opened its doors on September 24, 1888, originally training students as teachers and for agricultural and industrial jobs.\n\nBy the late 20th century, Saint Paul's College offered undergraduate degrees for traditional college students and distant learning students in the Continuing Studies Program. The school also offered adult education to help assist working adults to gain undergraduate degrees. Saint Paul's College had a Single Parent Support System Program that assisted single teen parents pursuing a college education.\n\nThe college had long struggled with significant financial difficulties, culminating in a court conflict in 2012 with its regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Throughout the 2012–2013 school year, the college sought to merge with another institution, but on June 3, 2013, the board announced the college would close on June 30, 2013.\n\nSaint Paul's eleven-building campus was situated on of green hills. Older buildings were constructed by students and donated by friends of the College. The college has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOn September 24, 1888, James Solomon Russell of the Protestant Episcopal Church founded the Saint Paul Normal and Industrial School, with fewer than a dozen students. The school was intended chiefly to develop African-American teachers, a critical and prestigious job in the late 19th and early 20th-century South. In 1914 the school boasted that \"The location of the school in the heart of the Black Belt of Virginia, with a Negro population of 100,000 almost at its very doors, is most favorable for the prosecution of uplift work.\"\n\nIn 1941 the name of the institution was changed to Saint Paul's Polytechnic Institute when the state granted the school authority to offer a four-year program. The first bachelor's degree was awarded in 1944. In 1957 the college adopted its present name to reflect its liberal arts and teacher education curricula.\n\nIn June 2012, the college's regional accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, stripped the college of its accreditation. Although the college had been on probation, it lost its accreditation for \"violations concerning financial resources, institutional effectiveness in support services, institutional effectiveness in academics and student services, lack of terminal degrees for too many faculty members, and a lack of financial stability.\" The college sued the accreditor, and two months later a court issued a preliminary injunction reinstating the college's probationary accreditation to protect it during further legal proceedings. Although supporters worked on plans to have St. Augustine's University in Raleigh, North Carolina, another historically black university of Episcopal heritage, acquire St Paul's, the deal was abandoned in May 2013. Shortly thereafter, St. Paul's College reported to SACS that it would close on June 30, 2013.\n\nIn 2017 the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which had assumed ownership of most of the former campus, sold the property to a Chinese-related firm that has not announced its plans.\n\nThe college focused on liberal arts, social sciences, education, business, mathematics, and natural sciences. It was committed to the development of \"students who will be equipped to live effectively in a global society.\"\n\nSaint Paul's College developed the Single Parent Support System, the only program of its kind in the United States. Initiated in 1987, the Single Parent Support System (SPSS) was an on-campus residential educational program designed for single parents with two or fewer children between the ages of two months to nine years old.\n\nThe program required students to attend the college year round on a full-time basis and maintain a projected graduation progression of three to four years, with a 2.5 G.P.A. each year. A significant aspect of the SPSS was a faculty mentoring system that assisted participants with choosing a major. Tutorial assistance and counseling services were available, and the college provided seminars that focused on academic success, transition to college, career planning, and parenting. The college also provided child care assistance.\n\nThe college discontinued its athletic programs in July 2011 in an effort to alleviate financial difficulties. The football team had costs of $300,000 to $400,000 annually. The men's sports teams were known as the Tigers and the women's sports teams were known as the Lady Tigers. The college competed in the NCAA Division II in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association.\n\nDaphne Trusty- Women's Basketball Player.

{"id": "2272969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272969", "title": "The Odd Couple II", "text": "The Odd Couple II\n\nThe Odd Couple II is a 1998 American buddy comedy film and the sequel to 1968's \"The Odd Couple\". Written by Neil Simon (who also produced), the film reunites Jack Lemmon as Felix Ungar and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison. The film was the actors' last together, and Simon's final screenplay. It is also significant among sequels for having one of the longest gaps between the release of the original and a sequel in which all leads return.\n\n\"The Odd Couple II\" was released in the United States on April 10, 1998. Each actor made only one more theatrical film after this: \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" for Lemmon and \"Hanging Up\" for Matthau, in which neither actor played a leading role, both in 2000.\n\nIt has been 17 years since Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar have seen one another. Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscar—the woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah.\n\nOn the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his ways—he is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separation—at least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them.\n\nHe and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire. If that were not enough, they get arrested several times by the local police, first for catching a ride in a truck carrying illegal Mexican immigrants. At a bar in town, they meet two extroverted women, Thelma and Holly, and buy them drinks. Accepting an offer of a ride from a stranger even older than themselves, Felix and Oscar end up inside a $150,000 vintage Rolls Royce Silver Wraith and trapped on the wrong side of the road when the stranger dies unexpectedly. Felix and Oscar are arrested a second time by the police.\n\nIrritated, exhausted and convinced that they'll never get to the wedding, they get arrested yet again for consorting with armed reprobate Rednecks who believe Oscar and Felix were flirting with their wild women, Thelma and Holly. The boys are freed and driven directly to the local airport by the police, who are only too pleased to be rid of them, especially the sheriff who tells his deputies not to arrest them again even if they were commit notorious crimes. A woman boarding the airplane is also en route to the wedding and recognizes them. She is Felice Adams, the sister of Oscar's ex-wife, Blanche. Felix's eyes light up when he learns that her husband died of a heart attack. He calls her \"Lise,\" which causes Oscar to ask Felix if she calls him \"Lix.\"\n\nThey finally arrive at the right place, only to find that Brucey is having second thoughts about the wedding due to his parents' bad history with marriage. Felix and Oscar argue with their ex-spouses, after which Oscar persuades his son to go through with it. Felix's suitcase is returned and the wedding goes off without a hitch.\n\nThe next morning, Felix and Felice leave on one flight and part ways with Oscar, who returns to Florida. Oscar is telling his poker friends about the wedding when the doorbell rings. It is Felix, who says things with Felice didn't work out. Felix wonders if he could move in with Oscar until he finds his own place. Oscar refuses, but eventually relents, insisting their days of being roommates will be over if Oscar catches Felix matching any of his socks. Before long Felix cleans up the apartment and Oscar is overcome with a sense of having been through all this before.\n\n\nHoward W. Koch, the producer of the original 1968 film by writer Neil Simon, had frequently discussed his desire for a sequel. Koch was unsuccessful in convincing Paramount Pictures to approve a sequel, despite the original film's success and the return of Simon as the writer. Simon had 37 pages written for \"The Odd Couple 2\", which he said were left \"sitting in the drawer\" for 10 years. John Goldwyn and Paramount studio chairman Sherry Lansing began serious consideration of a sequel in July 1996, before announcing it on March 30, 1997, without the involvement of Koch; instead, Paramount chose Robert W. Cort and Dave Madden as producers for the project. Silverman, Baranski, and Hughes were cast in May 1997.\n\nFilming began on June 9, 1997, in Los Angeles, California. Filming continued throughout the summer in various southern and central California cities, including Arcadia, Guadalupe, Lancaster, Palmdale, Pomona, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Shafter. In August 1997, filming was underway at the same Paramount Studios stage where the original film had been shot. Filming also took place at Hidden Valley, located in Ventura County, California. The film was shot with the title \"The Odd Couple II — Travelin' Light\". The film marked the 10th collaboration between Lemmon and Matthau. Jean Smart described the characters of Thelma and Holly as \"a bad '90s version of the Pigeon sisters,\" characters who appeared in the original film.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial failure. Despite the fact Lemmon and Matthau had success with their \"Grumpy Old Men\" films in the mid-1990s, this project was not as successful as expected. The film grossed $18 million at the North American domestic box office, and although Lemmon and Matthau's previous film \"Out to Sea\" also disappointed, it was better received by critics and had a slightly higher box office gross.\n\nIt holds a total of 24% on Rotten Tomatoes. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a dispiriting, flavorless travesty, the equivalent of moldy tofu mystery meat\".\n\nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on scale of A+ to F.\n\nAt the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Sequel and Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy.\n\n"}

{"id": "2272974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2272974", "title": "Zionist youth movement", "text": "Zionist youth movement\n\nA Zionist youth movement is an organization formed for Jewish children and adolescents for educational, social, and ideological development, including a belief in Jewish nationalism as represented in the State of Israel. Youth leaders in modern youth movements use informal education approaches to educate toward the movement's ideological goals.\n\nMost Zionist youth movements were established in Eastern Europe in the early twentieth century, desiring the national revival of the Jewish people in their own homeland, and soon formed an active and integral part of the Zionist movement. All emphasised aliyah (emigration to the Land of Israel) and community, with many also focussing on a return to nature.\n\nBlau-Weiss is considered to have been the first Zionist youth movement, established in Germany in 1912, and were inspired by the culture of outings and hikes prevalent in the German youth movement. Adopting an official Zionist platform in 1922, the movement stressed an agricultural way of life, leading many of its members to the Kibbutz movement in Mandatory Palestine.\n\nWith the upsurge in European nationalism and anti-Semitism, pogroms in Eastern Europe and the barring of Jewish members from German youth groups incubated the Zionist national consciousness of the Jewish youth, appealing to their idealism.\n\nYouth movements played a considerable role in politics, Jewish education, community organisation and Zionism, particularly between the two world wars. Within Europe, they were the nucleus of the Jewish resistance movements in the ghettos and camps of the Holocaust, and the partisans. They also led the escape (\"Beriha\") from Europe following the war, particularly to Palestine, where most surviving members settled. According to the International School for Holocaust Studies, the stated aim was bringing Jews to Palestine, out of a sense of Zionism. Some also saw immigration to Palestine as a first step towards the survivors' recuperation and return to normal life.\n\nMany of Eastern Europe's movements established themselves as worldwide organisations, although these were less influential. Alumni in Palestine organised their movements there from the 1920s, with an emphasis on pioneering and personal fulfillment (\"hagshama atzmit\"). There they strengthened the settlement organisations, particularly building the Kibbutz movement and most affiliated with or established Israel's political parties.\n\nAfter Israel's establishment in 1948, some of the movements' roles, such as education, were taken on by the State. With the growth and development of the country, movements' aims have been adjusted, despite a lesser public interest in the pioneering ideals of earlier Zionism.\n\nIn the Jewish diaspora, the nature of Zionist youth movements has varied in time and place. During periods when the general Zionist movement has been strong, such as that preceding the Six-Day War, movements have been particularly active. As well as acting towards Zionist causes, the movements have been seen as an important Jewish education and socialisation when it has not been otherwise available. Hence, with the development of stronger community structures, youth movements have often played a lesser role. Many youth, particularly in the large Jewish population of North America, have opted for Jewish social groups without ideological pursuits.\n\nYouth movements employ informal education methods to educate an ideology to their members. This is often achieved through regular meetings that socialise participants within their groups, as well as camps. Particularly on camps, but in all interactions movements create a \"counter-culture\" that produces a particular social environment where members can express themselves freely, although with an underlying focus towards the movement's ideology. Recently, there have been suggestion that youth movement counter-culture is waning, and needs to be revived.\n\nActivities and camps are essentially peer-led, usually by youth leaders who are often a few years older than the participants. Because of this, a friendly relationship is created between leaders and participants that encourages leadership by personal example (\"dugma ishit\"), whereby a leader's method of education is by being a moral, active and ideological member of the movement themself.\n\n\nZionist youth movements, both in Israel and the diaspora, continue to play a large role in community organisation, Jewish education, welfare, politics and activism. While upholding and adjusting their individual movement ideologies, diaspora movements commonly idealise Jewish continuity and identity in opposition to cultural assimilation, and Zionism in the way of an active community involvement while living in Israel (termed by some as \"aliyah nimshechet\" or \"continuing ascent\"), with importance placed upon leadership skills and personal development. In some countries, resistance in response to anti-Semitism is also a significant political focus.\n\nMovements generally focus on education for school-age youths, who are known as \"chanichim\" (Hebrew for educatees; singular \"chanich/a\"), approximately aged 8 to 18. The nucleus of movement leaders (\"madrichim\", singular \"madrich/a\"; literally \"guides\") are graduates (\"bogrim\", singular \"boger/et\") of the movement, although it is popular for senior \"chanichim\" to also lead junior groups.\n\nMuch of a movement's activity is carried out through regular meetings or events, in many countries weekly, as well as camps one or more times a year. Leaders use methods of informal education to inspire and teach \"chanichim\" within a particular ideological framework, or to induce discussion and thought. Such events are also highly social and often involve recreational activity., making the educational and ideological pursuits more enjoyable for participating youths.\n\n\nMost diaspora movements organise programmes in Israel, aiming for personal and ideological development, experience and training, such that participants would either remain in Israel as a form of ideological fulfillment, or return to their diaspora communities and movements in a leadership capacity. Many of these programs cover most of the year following one's graduation from high school, and are known as \"shnat hachshara\" (year of preparation) like their predecessors. Most require of their programmes' participants a two-year commitment to their movement on return from the program in Israel.\n\nMany such programmes are coordinated together with the Department for Jewish Zionist Education of the Jewish Agency for Israel, whose \"Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz\" (Institute for Leaders from Abroad) has been a component in many movements' year programmes since 1946. Year programmes may also include:\n\nAs well as education, the movement experience is directed towards \"hagshama atzmit\", or personal fulfillment of one's ideology, often closely aligned with that of their movement. Typically, for a diaspora movement member, this involves immigration to Israel, seen as an ultimate goal of Zionist ideals. Many movements organise groups of participants to take this difficult step together, forming a \"gar'in\" of \"olim\" (group of immigrants) who are prepared together for the process of \"aliyah\".\n\nIn Israel, it is common for active movement participants to commit a year of movement leadership between completing high-school and conscription into the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n\n"}
