Located in Rota in the Province of Cádiz, NAVSTA Rota is the largest American military community in Spain, housing US Navy and US Marine Corps personnel. There are also small US Army and US Air Force contingents on the base.\n\nNAVSTA Rota has been in use since 1953, when Spanish dictator Francisco Franco strengthened relations with the United States in order to improve local economies. The installation now covers more than on the northern shore of Cadiz, an area recognized for its strategic, maritime importance over the centuries.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Operations deployed Submarine Squadron 16 (SUBRON 16) to Rota on 28 January 1964 and embarked upon . completed its first Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) deterrent patrol with the Polaris missile and commenced the first refit and replenishment at Rota. During the early 1970s, the submarines assigned to SUBRON 16 were completing conversion to the Poseidon missile. That transition was completed when returned to Rota on 14 January 1974. Treaty negotiations between Spain and the United States in 1975 resulted in a planned withdrawal of SUBRON 16 from Spain, and the Chief of Naval Operations ordered studies to select a new refit site on the East Coast of the United States. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in June 1976; it called for the squadron's withdrawal from Spain by July 1979. In November 1976 the Secretary of the Navy announced Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia as that new refit site.\n\nAt its peak size in the early 1980s, NAVSTA Rota was home to 16,000 sailors and their families, to include two permanently forward deployed aviation squadrons, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VQ-2) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron TWENTY TWO (VR-22). VQ-2 was based at Rota from 1959 until 2005, when it relocated to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. VR-22 flew the C-130F and was based at Rota from 1982 until its inactivation in 1993. Through the early 1990s, a patrol squadron of P-3 Orion aircraft based in the United States would also be split-based between NAVSTA Rota and the Naval Air Facility at Lajes Air Base in the Azores to track Soviet naval vessels and submarines in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean. The patrol squadrons would rotate assignment to Rota and Lajes every six months and were augmented by Naval Air Reserve patrol squadrons for shorter durations on a periodic basis.\n\nWith the downsizing of the US Navy during the late 1980s and early 1990s, especially after the end of the Cold War, the base's population dramatically declined. The US Navy maintains approximately of the complex. There are about 4,000 Americans in Rota, including military, civilians, and their families.\n\nAs US Navy started to reduce its presence USAF realized the potential of the airfield as a refuelling stop in Middle East deployments. Rota was used by C-5 and C-141 planes in the Gulf War in 1991. Later the US agreed with Spain to improve air base installations so it could handle more cargo plane operations.\n\nIn April 2011, the commander of the US Navy garrison at the base, Captain William F. Mosk, was relieved of command and reassigned during an investigation into illegal drug use by US servicemen at the installation. Rear Admiral Tony Gaiani relieved Mosk for \"lost confidence in his ability to command\", specifically, to handle issues related to the investigation.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, US Secretary of Defense Panetta announced that the USN will station four Aegis warships at Rota to strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and bolster the missile defense of NATO as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). As of 2015, four US destroyers, including , , and are permanently forward-deployed to Naval Station Rota as part of the Missile Defense System.\n\nNaval Station Rota is home to an airfield and a seaport; the airfield has often caused the base to be misidentified as \"Naval Air Station Rota\". The base is the headquarters for Commander, U.S. Naval Activities Spain (COMNAVACTSPAIN), as well as a primary gateway for Air Mobility Command flights into Europe.\n\nNaval Station Rota is strategically located near the Strait of Gibraltar and at the halfway point between the United States and Southwest Asia. Because of this ideal location, the base is able to provide invaluable support to both US Sixth Fleet units in the Mediterranean and to USAF Air Mobility Command units transiting to Germany and Southwest Asia. The Base and its tenant commands are located within the boundaries of the Spanish \"Base Naval de Rota\". Under the guidance of the Agreement for Defense Cooperation, the US and Spanish navies work together and share many facilities. The US Navy has the responsibility for maintaining the station's infrastructure, including a airfield, three active piers, 426 facilities and 806 family housing units.\n\nFrom Naval Station Rota Spain, the VLF-transmitter Guardamar, which uses Torreta de Guardamar, the tallest man-made structure in the European Union as antenna, is telecontroled.\n\nThe base is used jointly by Spain and the United States. It remains under the Spanish flag and is commanded by a Spanish Vice Admiral. While the Spanish Navy is responsible for external security of the base, both Navies are charged with internal security. NAVSTA Rota is technically a tenant facility of the Rota Spanish Navy base. As a result, certain U.S. military customs are not observed, such as the display of a U.S. Flag, which is only allowed during the annual Fourth of July celebration or occasionally at half mast as a mark of respect with the ad-hoc permission of the Spanish Admiral.\n\nThis Base houses the Fleet Headquarters and the Naval Action Force, as well as the main operational units of the Navy: Naval Action Group 2, Aircraft Flotilla, 41st Escort Squadron.\n\n\nNaval Station Rota provides support for US and NATO ships; supports the safe and efficient movement of US Navy and US Air Force flights and passengers; and provides cargo, fuel, and ammunition to units in the region. The Naval Station is the only base in the Mediterranean capable of supporting Amphibious Readiness Group post-deployment wash-downs. The base port also offers secure, pier-side maintenance and back-load facilities. Rota supports Amphibious Readiness Group turnovers and hosts Sailors and Marines from visiting afloat units. The base also provides Quality of Life support to Morón Air Base, ARG support sites at Palma de Majorca, NATO headquarters in Madrid and the Military Sealift Command's Maritime Prepositioning Squadron 1.\n\nThe mission of US Forces at Rota, as well as other US Navy installations in the Mediterranean such as NAS Sigonella and Souda Air Base is to provide Command, Control and Logistics Support to US and NATO Operating Forces. These three facilities are undergoing a transformation from Maritime Patrol Aircraft airfields to Multi-role “Hubs” providing crucial air-links for USAF strategic airlift and mobility in support of US European Command (EUCOM), Central Command (CENTCOM) and African Area contingency operations under CENTCOM, EUCOM and the evolving Africa Command (AFRICOM).\n\n\nThe Operational Headquarters (OHQ) for the EU Naval Force moved from Northwood, UK to Rota and to Brest, France on 29 March 2019. EU's Operation Atalanta is commanded from Naval Station Rota.\n\nSince the 1980s, various leftist and activist pacifist groups have marched annually to protest the presence of U.S. and Spanish military personnel and equipment at the port of Rota. The most common path marches alongside the seaside streets of the town to protest at the individual U.S. (NAVSTA Rota), Spanish (\"\") and joint gates, where representatives of the groups read proclamations in favour of peace and freedom.\n\n\n"}

The libretto was written by Vladimir Belsky, and is based on a combination of two Russian legends: that of St. Fevroniya of Murom, and the city of Kitezh, which became invisible when attacked by the Tatars. The opera was completed in 1905, and the premiere performance took place at the Maryinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, on February 7, 1907, the last in Rimsky-Korsakov‘s lifetime.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov and Belsky first became interested in writing an opera on the Kitezh legend during the winter of 1898-1899, while they were working on the libretto to \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\". The idea of combining the legend of St. Fevroniya into the story was part of the project from the beginning. The project remained in the minds of both composer and the librettist, but would have to wait until 1903 until serious work could begin. During the period between 1898 and the beginning of 1903, the composer was occupied with the composition of the operas \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\", \"Servilia\", \"Kashchey the Immortal\" and \"Pan Voyevoda\". In his \"My Musical Life\", Rimsky-Korsakov mentions \"In the midst of work on \"Pan Voyevoda\" Belsky and I pondered intensively the subject of \"The Tale of the Invisible City of Kityezh and of the Maiden Fyevroniya\".\" Rimsky-Korsakov had written a rough draft of the first act by the end of summer, and Belsky had completed the libretto by spring. By summer of 1904, Rimsky-Korsakov had finished the composition of the second tableau of Act III and was orchestrating the opera. During the summer of 1905, while writing his \"Principles of Orchestration\", Rimsky-Korsakov also polished the orchestral score to \"Kitezh\", and made a clean final copy to send to the printers.\n\nThe world premiere was given in Saint Petersburg, Russia at the Mariinsky Theatre on 20 February (O.S. 7 February), 1907. The scenic designers were\nKonstantin Korovin and Apollinary Vasnetsov. A year later, the opera was given its premiere at the Bolshoy Theatre, Moscow, Russia on 15 February 1908. Scenic designers were Korovin, Klodt, Vasnetsov. The first performance out of Russia took place at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, February 1926. In South America it was premiered at Buenos Aires's Teatro Colón in 1929. Earl V. Moore led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in the U.S. premiere on May 21, 1932, at Hill Auditorium in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was also performed in New York in 1995 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in a production that featured the orchestra, chorus, and soloists of the Kirov Opera, conducted by Artistic Director Valery Gergiev, and featuring soloist Galina Gorchakova. The first London performance, under Albert Coates, was a concert presentation in 1926. It was not performed in London again until 1994, when Gergiev and his Kirov Opera ensemble gave a performance, in concert again, at London's Barbican. The only staged performance in the UK took place at the Edinburgh Festival with the Kirov and Gergiev in 1995.\n\nSource:\n\n\"Kitezh\" is arguably Rimsky-Korsakov's finest opera, often being referred to as \"the Russian \"Parsifal\"; however, it is not part of the standard operatic repertoire outside of Russia. Stylistically, it is more representative of Rimsky-Korsakov's work than the better-known \"The Golden Cockerel\". In its use of Russian history and legend, Oriental exoticism, and a mix of the real and the supernatural, the work has been called a \"summation of the nationalistic operatic tradition of Glinka and The Five.\" Rimsky-Korsakov considered the work to be his final artistic statement, not planning to write another opera until unexpectedly inspired to write \"The Golden Cockerel\" as a satire of current political events in Russia. Although the composer often made use of fairy tale, \"Kitezh\" is the only one of his operas to make use of supernatural or religious themes. Simon Morrison points out that in spite of the Christian themes, \"[t]his was a secular heaven.\"\n\n'Hymn to the Wilderness', an orchestral depiction of the scenery of forest wilderness.\n\n\"Kerzhenskii Woods\"\nThese wild forests with dense thickets and bogs are the home of Fevronia (and her \"brother\", a treecreeper), who lives in a hut. She is besotted with dreams and poetical fancies, and is a daughter of nature, being on friendly terms with the birds and wild animals, and knowing all the mysteries of the forest. One day she meets a young prince in the forest, who has been hunting and has lost his way. He is Vsevolod, son of Prince Yuri of Kitezh, and he falls for her beauty, spiritual integrity and love of people and of nature. They sing a love duet, in which he places a ring on her finger, but this is interrupted by the sound of the hunting party from afar. He bids her farewell and goes to find the party, while she learns to whom she has become betrothed.\n\n\"Little Kitezh on the Volga\"\nHoliday festivities are going on in the market square in this place, because the wedding procession of Princess Fevronia is expected to come through. The people crowd around the buffoon and laugh at the bear's antics. An old psaltery-player comes and sings a solemn song. The rich townsfolk, who think Prince Vsevolod should have married a girl with better family connections, persuade Grishka Kuterma (the local drunkard) to mock the princess. The procession approaches to the sound of bells, and (in an old custom) the wedding guests throw honey-cakes, ribbons and coins into the crowd as the bride's 'ransom'. The people chase away Grishka and the procession takes up a wedding song.\n\nSuddenly the merrymaking is interrupted as the town is surrounded by an army of invading Tatars. There is a sorrowful lamenting chorus of the people. Fevronia is captured by the Tatars and is racked by anxiety for the fate of her bridegroom and the city of Greater Kitezh, which the Tatars will attack next. Grishka agrees to betray Russia and to lead the Tatars to the city, while Fevronia prays that it be rendered invisible.\n\n\"Scene 1 - Great Kitezh\"\nHearing of the invasion, the people of Greater Kitezh gather in the main square in arms, in dead of night. The prince's huntsman Fyodor Poyarok, whom the Tatars have blinded, tells them of the atrocities committed at Little Kitezh. A boy announces that the Tatars approach. The people prepare for battle, and the Prince leads a battalion which sings a chorus of resolution to fight to the end. Then, a golden fog rises over the Lake and shrouds the city, hiding it from the enemy: only the church bells drone faintly. A fierce battle breaks out on the banks of the river Kherzhenets. A symphonic interlude, composed around the battle-song theme and another representing the Tatar hordes, depicts the grim scene, and introduces:\n\n\"Scene 2 - At the lake Svetlyi Iar\"\nAfter a long trek through the wilderness, Grishka has led the Tatars to the edge of the lake. Unable to see the city for the fog, the Tatars accuse him of treachery and tie him to a tree, intending to kill him in the morning. They make fires and share out their loot. Two of the Tatar leaders, Burundai and Bedyai, quarrel over Fevronia and Bedyai is slain. The Tatars, preparing for night, sing a dismal song about ravens flocking to carnage. They sleep, and Fevronia is heard mourning Vsevolod, who has fallen in battle. Grishka, tormented by fear and remorse, begs her to release him, and she does so believing that kindness will heal his soul. But he is haunted by nightmares, in which the chimes of the Kitezh bells become distorted in his brain. He rushes to drown himself, but stops at the shore as the dawn shows that while the city remains invisible, the reflection of the city can be seen in the water, and the bells ring out ever louder. The Tatars are stricken with fear by the sight and disperse.\n\n\"Scene 1 - Kerzhenskii Woods\"\nIn pitch darkness Fevronia and Grishka, exhausted, struggle through the wilderness. Grishka is delirious, and after singing a song about the devil and dancing wildly he runs off screaming. Fevronia is lulled to sleep by the sounds of the forest. In her dream the scene is transformed, with fantastic blossoming flowers, candles in the trees, and fairy songbirds. The mythical bird of sorrow, Alkonost, appears to tell her she must die. She welcomes death, and her prince appears to lead her to Kitezh. A second bird, Sirin, promises immortality. The enchantment comes out irresistibly in the Symphonic Interlude leading to:\n\n\"Scene 2 - The Invisible City\"\nThe scene is in the legendary city of beautiful people with gracious hearts. Fevronia and Vsevolod, Prince Yuri and Fyodor Poyarok all reappear. Fevronia sends a message of hope to Grishka, telling him that one day he too will find the way to the Invisible City. Vsevolod leads his bride to the altar with wedding songs, and a Hymn of Joy, as a solemn chorus, ends the opera. Good, Love and Justice are victorious.\n\nAct 1<br>\nAct 3<br>\nAct 4<br>\n\nAudio Recordings:\n\n\n\n"}

A deformed spidron is a three-dimensional figure sharing the other properties of a specific spidron, as if that spidron were drawn on paper, cut out in a single piece, and folded along a number of legs.\n\nIt was first modelled in 1979 by Dániel Erdély, as a homework presented to Ernő Rubik, for Rubik's design class, at the Hungarian University of Arts and Design (now: Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design). Erdély also gave the name \"Spidron\" to it, when he discovered it in the early 70s. The name originates from the English names of spider and spiral, because the shape is reminiscent of a spider web. The term ends with the affix \"-on\" as in polygon.\n\nIn his initial work Erdély started with a hexagon. He combined every corner with the after-next one. In his mathematical analysis of spidrons Stefan Stenzhorn demonstrated that it is possible to create a spidron with every regular Polygon greater than four. Furthermore, you can vary the number of points to the next combination. Stenzhorn reasoned that after all the initial hexagon-spidron is just the special case of a general spidron.\n\nIn a two-dimensional plane a tessellation with hexagon-spidrons is possible. The form is known from many works by M.C. Escher, who devoted himself to such bodies of high symmetry. Due to their symmetry spidrons are also an interesting object for mathematicians.\n\nThe spidrons can appear in a very large number of versions, and the different formations make possible the development of a great variety of plane, spatial and mobile applications. These developments are suitable to perform aesthetic and practical functions that are defined in advance by the consciously selected arrangements of all the possible characteristics of symmetry. The spidron system is under the protection of several know-how and industrial pattern patents. It was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition Genius Europe in 2005. It has been presented in a number of art magazines, conferences and international exhibitions. During the last two years it has also appeared, in several versions, as a public area work. Since spidron-system is the personal work by Dániel Erdély but in the development of the individual formations he worked together with several Hungarian, Dutch, Canadian and American colleagues, the exhibition is a collective product in a sense, several works and developments are a result of an international team-work.\n\nSpidron is a registered trademark.\n\nMany spidrons are designed to correspond to deformed spidrons that are also polyhedra.\n\nConsidering the use of spidrons Daniel Erdély enumerated several possible applications:\n\n\n"}

The majority of programming was shared but some was produced specifically for Manchester. At its launch in 2006 it was owned by GCap Media, and later became part of the Global Radio group.\n\nIn September 2015 the station was replaced, along with XFM London, by Radio X.\n\nXFM Manchester was awarded a 12-year (until 2017) FM radio licence on 9 June 2005, beating 18 rival bids. Established local radio presenter Terry Christian was cited in the licence application document but he remained at the relaunched BBC Radio Manchester.\n\nBefore its launch 20 February 2006, XFM Manchester began occasional technical tests consisting of a playlist of songs chosen to appeal to its audience. XFM Manchester was launched at 8 am on 15 March 2006. A collage of Manchester related clips was played, and I Am the Resurrection by The Stone Roses, and Song 2 by Blur. The first presenter on air was Paul Tonkinson. Launch events were held all day across Manchester, including a world record attempt in Albert Square to shake the most number of maracas at any one time.\n\nSome presenters were formerly members of Manchester bands and institutions, including Inspiral Carpets' keyboard player Clint Boon, Elbow's frontman Guy Garvey, The Smiths' bass player Andy Rourke, Factory Records boss Tony Wilson, and The Haçienda's Dave Haslam.\n\nXFM was initially broadcast from studios at Laser House in Salford Quays, the same building as Century 105.4. But after Century was sold by GCap Media to GMG in late 2006, the two stations ceased to share resources, and Xfm Manchester moved to studios at the nearby Exchange Quay, also in Salford. After Global Radio acquired the station, it moved the operations of its own Capital FM Manchester to the same site.\n\nXFM Manchester's 1 kW transmitter is situated on the roof of City Tower, formerly the Sunley Building, overlooking Piccadilly Gardens in the city centre, the same place as Capital FM Manchester and 106.1 Rock Radio's transmitter. All three services share the same broadcast antenna system situated on the centre's tower which is illuminated with red Aircraft warning lights at night. Xfm's analogue signal is available to an estimated 1.3 million people over the age of 15.\n\nIn May 2007, the then-owner of XFM Manchester, GCap Media, announced that all local presenters would be removed from the daytime (10 am-4 pm) lineup. Instead, an interactive show, incorporating listener requests via the website and phone in, 'vox-pops', live music and entertainment news would be broadcast. This show, named XU, was launched later that month. It received mixed reviews, and was eventually dropped a year later, replaced with networked daytime content sourced from XFM London.\n\nIn August 2007, XFM Manchester acquired the rights from 105.4 Century FM to broadcast commentary from all Manchester United games, as an adjunct to the station's usual music programming, with commentary provided by presenters including Mickey Thomas. The contract ran for one season with Key 103 becoming United's official commentary partner for 2008–11.\n\nIn February 2008 GCap Media announced it would be selling the analogue licence for the station. This decision was blamed on GCap's desire to cut costs while trying to fight off a takeover bid by rival group Global Radio. Once Global's takeover of GCap succeeded, the decision to sell Xfm Manchester was reversed.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a leading figure of the new philosophers.\n\nGlucksmann began his career as a Marxist, but went on to reject communism in the popular book \"La Cuisinière et le Mangeur d'Hommes\" (1975), and later became an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russian foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of human rights. In recent years he opposed the claim that Islamic terrorism is the product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West.\n\nAndré Glucksmann was born in 1937 in Boulogne-Billancourt, the son of Ashkenazi Jewish parents from Austria-Hungary. His father was from Bukovina, which later became part of Romania, and his mother from Prague, which later became the capital of Czechoslovakia.\n\nGlucksmann's father was killed in World War II, and his mother and sister were active in the French Resistance. The family \"narrowly escaped deportation to the camps\" during the Holocaust, which influenced Glucksmann's developing ideas of \"the state as the ultimate source of barbarism\".\n\nHe studied at the Lycée la Martinière in Lyon, and later enrolled at École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud. His first book, \"Le Discours de la Guerre\", was published in 1968.\n\nIn 1975 he published the anti-Marxist book \"La Cuisinière et le Mangeur d'Hommes\" - subtitled \"Réflexions sur l'État, le marxisme et les camps de concentration\", in which he argued that Marxism leads inevitably to totalitarianism, tracing parallels between the crimes of Nazism and Communism. In his next book \"Les maitres penseurs\", published in 1977 and translated into English as \"Master Thinkers\" (Harper & Row, 1980), he traced the intellectual justification for totalitarianism back to the ideas articulated by various German philosophers such as Fichte, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. In the years of the Vietnam War, Glucksmann rose to national prominence after expressing his support for Vietnamese boat people. He began working with Bernard-Henri Lévy criticizing Communism. Both had formerly been well known Marxists. Shortly afterwards they became known, along with others of their generation who rejected Marxism, as New Philosophers, a term coined by Lévy.\n\nIn 1985, Glucksmann signed a petition to President Reagan urging him to continue his support for the Contras in Nicaragua. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Glucksmann became an advocate for the use of nuclear power. In 1995 he supported the resumption of nuclear tests by Jacques Chirac. He supported the NATO intervention in Serbia in 1999. He also called for Chechnya to become independent.\n\nIn his book \"Dostoyevsky in Manhattan\", Glucksmann asserts that nihilism, particularly as depicted by Dostoyevsky in his novels \"Demons\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov\", is the 'characteristic form' of modern terrorism. Drawing on Ivan Karamazov's dictum that \"If there is no God, everything is permitted\", Glucksmann argues that:\n\nThe inner nature of nihilistic terrorism is that everything is permissible, whether because God exists and I am his representative, or because God does not exist and I take his place.\n\nHis 2006 book \"Une rage d’enfant\" is an autobiography which talks about how his experiences as a young Jew in occupied France led to his interest in philosophy and his belief in the importance of intervention:\n\nMy style of thinking is to compare what happens on the TV, in the news and so on, and then extract what I can from books of philosophers to understand it. Philosophy for me is like subtitles. The problem comes from current events but the answer is supplied by philosophy.\n\nGlucksmann criticises the notion that Islamic terrorism is a product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West, arguing that the first victims of Islamic terrorism are Muslims:\n\nWhy do the 200,000 slaughtered Muslims of Darfur not arouse even half a quarter of the fury caused by 200-times fewer dead in Lebanon? Must we deduce that Muslims killed by other Muslims don’t count – whether in the eyes of Muslim authorities or viewed through the bad conscience of the West?\n\nGlucksmann supported military action by the West in Afghanistan and Iraq, and was highly critical of Russian foreign policy, supporting for example Chechen independence. However, he was against the Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence from Georgia, arguing that Georgia is essential to maintaining European Union \"energy independence,\" vis-a-vis Russia, through access to oil and gas reserves in the former Soviet republics: \"If Tbilisi falls, there will be no way to get around Gazprom and guarantee autonomous access to the gas and petroleum wealth of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan\".\nAs proof of Russia's plans to use energy blackmail, Glucksmann referenced a biting anti-Gazprom satirical song performed at the annual satirical award show \"Silver Rubber Boot\", which made jokes like: \"If the Eurovision Song Contest denies victory to Russia again, we are going to drive to their concert and block their gas with our bodies!\" Glucksmann cited this as evidence that the Russian people want to cut off gas to Ukraine and Europe. He wrote:\n\nConsider a popular song performed by a military choir in Moscow. Its chorus depicts the \"radiant future\" that Gazprom is preparing: \"Europe has a problem with us? We will cut off its gas...\" The Russian public loves the song.\n\nGlucksmann supported Nicolas Sarkozy for the April–May 2007 presidential election.\n\nIn August 2008 he co-signed an open letter with Václav Havel, Desmond Tutu, and Wei Jingsheng calling upon the Chinese authorities to respect human rights both during and after the Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nHe was a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.\n\nGlucksmann died in Paris on 10 November 2015 at the age of 78.\n\nIn reaction to his death, President François Hollande said that Glucksmann always \"listened to the suffering of peoples\". Former president and opposition leader Nicolas Sarkozy commented on Glucksmann's death by saying: \"[Glucksmann] turned a page in French thought from the second half of the 20th Century\".\n\n\n\"Note: Many of his works were translated into German by his long-term colleague Helmut Kohlenberger.\"\n\n\n"}

The station subsequently relaunched with a more mainstream format, and a new advert featuring a cartoon radio saying \"Don't be afraid!\", which referred to the perceived inaccessibility of its old format. The soft-rock revamp was not a success, culminating in listener-led protests outside the Capital Radio studios. Listeners also lodged objections with the Radio Authority, which found XFM to be acting in a manner contrary to its licence requirements, and a degree of alternative output was eventually restored, particularly through night-time playlists and specialist shows.\n\nFollowing the take-over by Capital, the station dropped its wide-ranging music policy, which was replaced by a format based on USA college stations. The first audience figures after this change showed a sharp decline. The DJs were no longer able to select some of their own tracks, and specialist shows were dropped. The station soon became more male-orientated and featured football coverage and \"laddish\" output. This came to an end after the Radio Authority fined XFM £50,000 for breakfast presenter Tom Binns's joking about bestiality on air.\n\nCapital Radio attempted to increase XFM's listening figures, recruiting DJs such as Zoe Ball, former BBC Radio 1 presenter, and re-recruiting comedians Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant who took voluntary redundancy when Capital bought the station, after the pair rose to significance with the first airing of \"The Office\". Together with talent such as Zane Lowe and Christian O'Connell, this yielded growing listening figures. The music was, and is today, a play-listed mix of popular indie and soft rock. \n\nHost John Kennedy is the only member of the current presenter lineup that has been with the radio station since its very first broadcasts. His new music show, X-Posure is the station's longest running show and is credited as being the first to give radio play to artists including Adele, Florence and the Machine, Razorlight and Mumford & Sons.\n\nXfm has held 28-day Restricted Service Licence FM broadcasts in a number of British cities, including Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow.\n\nIn 2000, Xfm London was added to a number of DAB multiplexes around the country, and in January 2006 its reach expanded when it replaced The Storm on a number of other local multiplexes, creating near-national coverage. It was at one point reported that this 'national' version of Xfm London (known as \"Xfm UK\") would have local content drop-ins within it (e.g. news, travel) over time, but this ultimately never came to pass. Most DAB coverage of XFM carried the London version of the station, but for a time some multiplexes in the North of England instead received a feed of XFM Manchester.\n\nIn 2001, Xfm rehired Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant to run the Saturday afternoon show. Karl Pilkington joined them to 'just push the buttons' but eventually became the focal point of the show. The trio often called the station a 'tin pot station', 'shoddy' and 'not just a small station in London but the smallest station in that building'.\n\nBy 2002, the station had added many specialist shows, such as 'London Express', 'The A-Z of Alternative Music' and 'The Remix'. Afternoon and early-evening shows with Zane Lowe and Tim Lovejoy were innovative and although the daytime playlist consisted of 40 current releases, these were changed frequently, and the overall playlist contained about 90 records. However, in time the specialist shows gradually declined in number, and the playlist was again restricted in number.\n\nOn 9 June 2005, the group was awarded a permanent FM broadcasting licence to serve the city of Manchester as Xfm Manchester. This station went on air in March 2006. Also in 2005, Xfm was among the bidders for the regional North East franchise on 97.5 FM, but this licence was ultimately awarded to Smooth Radio by Ofcom.\n\nOn 4 January 2006, GCap Media relaunched its Central Scotland regional station Beat 106 as Xfm Scotland.\n\nIn 2007, a fourth station joined the network with the launch of a new regional Xfm for south Wales, based at the Cardiff studio also home to Red Dragon FM (now Capital South Wales).\n\nIn May 2007, in an attempt to cut costs, the parent company of Xfm, GCap Media, announced that they would be removing all presenters from the daytime (10 am–4 pm) lineup and replacing them with a jukebox based upon listener requests through their websites. On 6 March 2008 an announcement was made reversing the decision to remove daytime presenters. From 25 March 2008 a new schedule restoring daytime schedules was put in place.\n\nA new schedule was launched on 12 January 2009. Changes at this date included Jo Good leaving the \"Afternoon Show, including Afternoon X List\", and new signing Richard Skinner taking over the \"Morning Show\" from Rick Shaw. The times of the shows were also adjusted, with the morning show only becoming a two-hour show (previously a three-hour show) and the afternoon show becoming a four-hour show (previously a 3-hour show). The weekend schedule was also adjusted at this time, with Rick Shaw moving to present the \"Weekend Morning Show\" on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm and Lliana Bird taking over the afternoon slots. This led to other changes in the weekend schedule, such as Marsha Shandur's \"Sunday Brunch\" ending, and the air times of Marc Haynes \"Certificate X\" changing (from 1 pm – 3 pm to 6 pm – 8 pm). Jo Good left the station during these changes, but rejoined at the end of 2012.\n\nOn 11 February 2008 GCap Media announced that they would be selling the analogue licence for the Manchester, Scotland and South Wales stations, retaining only XFM London. This decision was made in an attempt to shore up profits and concentrate on 'winning brands', calling the former nationalisation strategy into question. After this announcement, in early 2008, breakfast show host Alex Zane admitted on air that the future of the London station was also being reviewed, even making jokey references to perhaps being out of a job soon. The sale of the South Wales station went ahead, with Town and Country Broadcasting relaunching this as Nation Radio; the sale of the Scotland and Manchester stations was suspended when Global Radio entered into discussions to purchase GCap Media.\n\nThe re-appointment of a previous Programme Controller in 2011 led to a number of changes to Xfm's output. Specialist shows such as \"Music:Response\" and \"Mix Master Mike Show\" returned, as did presenter Danny Wallace. In September 2011 a new Xfm schedule began, and included Mary Anne Hobbs moving to a re-launched evening show, \"Music:Response\". A new \"local\" slot was introduced. Broadcaster Richard Skinner left the station after two years. The show \"Import:Export\", produced and directed by Redefined Media, was resurrected and linked to KROQ Los Angeles. Further weekend signings included \"The Sun\" journalist Gordon Smart starting a three-hour Sunday show. Smart's show ended in October 2013 when he left to join the \"Scottish Sun\" as editor. As part of the 2013 schedule Jon Holmes took over the breakfast show. Comedian Josh Widdicombe presented a show on Saturdays between 10 am and 1 pm. It was announced in March 2015 that Russell Brand would be hosting a new Sunday night show, which was to first air on 15 March.\n\nFollowing Heart and Galaxy owner Global's takeover of GCap Media, Xfm Scotland became Galaxy (it went on to become Capital Scotland in 2011), leaving just Manchester and London with local Xfm stations.\n\nFollowing Global's acquisition of Real and Smooth Ltd, the Paisley/Renfrewshire 96.3 FM service previously broadcast as Real Radio XS became a new XFM Scotland in 2014. This service was available across central Scotland over DAB.\n\nUp until the end of the Xfm branding, the London, Manchester and Scotland stations broadcast 43 hours a week of local programming – weekday breakfast and drive, and four hours a day at weekends – with networked programming, primarily from London, at other times. TV platforms followed the London output and all three stations were streamed online.\n\nOn 7 September 2015, it was announced that Xfm would be rebranded as \"Radio X\" on 21 September. The rebrand was carried out in partnership with creative agency We Are MBC. The rebranded station launched with new presenters including Chris Moyles, Vernon Kay, Johnny Vaughan and Ricky Wilson joining some existing XFM presenters on a refreshed schedule.\n\nXFM aired its last day of programming on Sunday 13 September 2015. XFM Scotland ceased broadcasting entirely on the same day with Global Radio handing back the Paisley licence to Ofcom.\n\nA 'holding' service of music and announcements began transmitting on national DAB under the Radio X title the following day, with this service also taking the place of XFM on FM, TV and online until the full launch of the new Radio X at 6:30am on Monday 21 September 2015.\n\nThe first song played on the rebranded Radio X, by Chris Moyles just before 7am on 21 September 2015, was \"Love Machine\" by Girls Aloud, an off-format nod to media reports of a male bias by the new station.\n\nRadio X is now available nationally via Digital One national DAB, with all local-layer XFM carriage dropped (replaced in many cases by Gold). The new national Radio X also replaced XFM on FM in London and Manchester, and on other platforms including TV and online. There is no longer any local output on the Manchester station, and the only variance between the UK, London and Manchester services is split advertising and top-of-the-hour news intros.\n\nThe stations which formerly comprised the Xfm network were:\n\nFormer hosts on the network include:\n\n"}
{"id": "2016621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016621", "title": "Florian Geyer", "text": "Florian Geyer\n\nFlorian Geyer von Giebelstadt (also spelled \"Geier\"; \"c\". 1490 – 10 June 1525) was a German nobleman, diplomat, and knight. He became widely known for leading peasants during the German Peasants' War.\n\nFlorian Geyer was born around 1490 at Geyer Castle in Giebelstadt, Lower Franconia. After the deaths of his father Dietrich (in 1492) and of his two older brothers, Florian Geyer inherited the family castle and fortune. In 1512 and 1513, he was a guest at the court of King Henry VIII in England, where he may have been exposed to the reformist ideas of John Wycliffe and the Lollards. In 1517, after refusing to pay 350-year-old interest claims from Neumünster Collegiate Church, Geyer was excommunicated.\n\nIn 1519, Geyer served under Casimir Margrave of Brandeburg-Kulmbach in the army of the Swabian League against Ulrich Duke of Württemberg and Götz von Berlichingen in Möckmühl. Later that year Brandeburg-Kulmbach sent Geyer to his brother Albrecht Duke of Brandenburg-Prussia, then Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, to support him in the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521). Geyer negotiated the truce which ended it. He remained in Brandenburg-Prussia's service until 1523, travelling to various European courts on diplomatic missions.\n\nIn 1523, Geyer accompanied Martin Luther on a visit to Wittenberg in Brandenburg-Prussia. If not already sympathetic to the Protestant reformation, Geyer was probably won over to Luther's ideals at this meeting.\n\nWhen the German Peasants' War broke out in 1524, Florian Geyer, together with a handful of low-ranking knights and several hundred hastily-trained peasant militiamen, established the Black Company (often called the Black Host or Black Band), which was possibly the only heavy cavalry division in European history to fight on the side of a peasant revolution. By checking Imperial and Protestant knights on the battlefield, the Black Company allowed preacher Thomas Müntzer and his infantry to score a string of victories in Thuringia. Geyer is reputed to have had the words \"Nulla crux, nulla corona\" (\"Neither cross nor crown\") scratched on the blade of his sword. All sides credited him with the wanton destruction of cathedrals and castles, and summary executions of the lords and priests contained therein. These destructions played a part in causing Martin Luther to side with the princes, calling on them to slaughter the rebellious peasants.\n\nAs the Peasants' War dragged on, many of the rebel peasants returned home, and most of the knights who, alongside Geyer, had joined Müntzer deserted or defected. Müntzer himself was defeated at the Battle of Frankenhausen and executed shortly afterwards.\n\nConflicting accounts place Geyer with the company, or alone in Rothingen in the aftermath of the Battle of Frankenhausen. The Black Company was falsely informed of victory at Frankenhausen, and ambushed outside of Ingolstadt. They managed to regroup, retreat, and fortify the town's castle and cathedral. The cathedral was burned with no survivors, and the castle was taken after three assaults. A portion of the Black Company broke free, only to be encircled again in nearby woodlands. If Geyer had been leading the Black Company through the Battle of Ingolstadt, he barely escaped with his life. Geyer may, however, have been stranded at Rothingen the entire time while waiting for an escort from the Black Company, which was only to be barred from entering the town. The later attempts to stamp out memory of the uprising have obscured these details.\n\nWhether or not Geyer was at Ingolstadt, he was one of the last survivors. In the night from 9 to 10 June 1525 he was contacted in Würzburg by two servants of his brother-in-law Wilhelm von Grumbach, who had the stated their intention of helping him rekindle the Peasants' War. While traveling together, they stabbed Geyer to death in the Gramschatz Forest near Würzburg. The location of his remains is unknown.\n\nThe family of Florian Geyer died out in the early 18th century and their castle in Giebelstadt passed into other hands, but is still the site of the annual \"Florian Geyer Festspiele\".\n\nGeyer was heralded as a communist revolutionary in Friedrich Engels' \"The Peasant War in Germany\" (1850). In this work, Engels asserts that the war was primarily a class struggle over control of farms and mines, which subverted the Biblical language and metaphors commonly understood by peasants. In this spirit, a regiment of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, Grenzregiment 3 \"Florian Geyer\", was named after him.\n\nGeyer was also the hero of one of Gerhart Hauptmann's major plays, the historical drama \"Florian Geyer\" (1896), and the inspiration for the German folk song, \"\" (\"We are Geyer's Black Band\"), which has been adopted by union movements as a rousing anthem. \n\nGeyer was also considered a heroic figure by Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party. The 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" was named after him in March 1944, during World War II.\n\n\n"}

He served at the siege of Flushing in 1809, and in the American campaigns of 1812–14, during which he was present at the capture of Fort Castine, and the occupation of the part of the state of Maine east of the Penobscot, and was commanding engineer at the construction of the extensive works thrown up by the British on the Castine peninsula. He attained the rank of captain in 1814, in which year he married the daughter of Captain W. Johnstone. Subsequently he served with the army of occupation in France.\n\nAs commanding royal engineer in Upper Canada, he rendered very important services during the Canadian rebellion in 1837–39, particularly in February 1838, when, at the head of a force of militia and volunteers, in the absence of regular troops, he defeated the designs of the insurgents at Napairee, and the brigands at Hickory Island, for an attack on the city of Kingston. For these services he was knighted. In his capacity as a military engineer, Bonnycastle oversaw the fortification of Fort Henry in modern Kingston, Ontario. He was afterwards commanding engineer in Newfoundland.\n\nHe became a brevet-major in 1837, a regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1840, and retired from the service in 1847. \nHe died in 1848. \n\nThrough his son, Henry William John Bonnycastle (1813–1888) would come a prominent Bonnycastle family of Canadian politicians and adventurers and the founder of Harlequin Enterprises, the world's largest publisher of romance novels.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016623", "title": "Psycho-Pirate", "text": "Psycho-Pirate\n\nThe Psycho-Pirate is the name of two DC Comics supervillains, dating back to the Golden Age of Comics.\n\nBob Frazer portrayed the character for his live-action debut during The CW's 2018 Arrowverse crossover \"Elseworlds\".\n\nThe Charles Halstead version of Psycho-Pirate first appears in \"All-Star Comics\" #23 and was created by Gardner Fox and Joe Gallagher.\n\nThe Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate first appears in \"Showcase\" #56 and was created by Fox and Murphy Anderson.\n\nCharles Halstead is a minor character who first appears in \"All-Star Comics\" #23, created by Gardner Fox and Joe Gallagher. He was originally a linotyper for the \"Daily Courier\" who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the \"Daily Courier\". A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the \"Courier\" with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the \"Courier\", challenging the Justice Society to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by Dr. Mid-Nite. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only the Atom to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure—a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the \"Courier\" just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in \"Showcase #56\", created by Gardner Fox and Murphy Anderson.\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later retconned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on Earth-Two. Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with Doctor Fate and Hourman.\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent Gotham City citizens Bruce Wayne and Alan Scott; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho-Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his Justice Society comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate Flash, who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the Secret Society of Super Villains, having been recruited by the Ultra-Humanite to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the Justice League defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as Limbo.\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the All-Star Squadron and the time-lost Infinity Inc.\n\nIn the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" limited series, the Monitor recruits Hayden—who goes on to help Firestorm recruit his enemy Killer Frost to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm—but Hayden is quickly abducted by the Anti-Monitor. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive Barry Allen. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho-Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of \"Infinity, Inc.\" #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho-Pirate loses all memories of the \"Crisis\" and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain Baron Bedlam in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (\"Outsiders Special\" and \"Infinity, Inc. Special\"), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in Grant Morrison's run on \"Animal Man\", imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the \"Crisis\" and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho-Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the \"Crisis\" back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho-Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in Limbo. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the Force of July. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against Shade, the Changing Man as his team falls under attack from the Suicide Squad; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the \"Underworld Unleashed\" crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon Neron in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of Manhunter before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the \"Fate\" series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the \"Joker: Last Laugh\" crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The Joker initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho-Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the \"JSA Classified\" #1–4 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as Donna Troy and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho-Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\" This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen Nightwing, Superboy, and Wonder Girl attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and Black Adam, who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in \"Justice League of America\" #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are Signalman and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 \"Raven\" miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\nIn the \"Blackest Night\" storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the Hall of Justice. Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a Black Lantern during the event. He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway Conner Kent into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern Superman from Earth 2, however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Earth-2 Superman (Kal-L), causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new depiction of Psycho-Pirate first appears in \"Superboy\" Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by Brainiac with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the H.I.V.E. Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. Psycho-Pirate managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in Metropolis.\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out Hector Hammond and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When Superman arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. Hayden is then surprised by Lois Lane, who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. Hayden, however, disappears in the aftermath of the battle. At the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront Superboy and Doctor Psycho who are in New York City looking for a psychic called Shift. Shift reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.\n\nIn \"DC Rebirth,\" Psycho-Pirate and Hugo Strange are sent to Gotham as part of Amanda Waller's Task Force X. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to Bane, who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When Batman learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the Bronze Tiger, the Ventriloquist, Catwoman, and Punch and Jewelee. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of Santa Prisca and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne). The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence Jay Garrick; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the \"Flashpoint\" Batman from the dead to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers, however, he is a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions onto people. Often it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest any DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" or any living character period. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the \"New 52\" reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths, levitation, draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own, projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he uses to attack, forming a psychic link with another person, projecting his mind over tremendous distances (essentially granting him omnipresence), deflecting psionic attacks, projecting bolts of psionic energy and creating illusions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for directing the films \"The Five Senses\" (1999) and \"Fugitive Pieces\" (2007). He has also worked as director on the television shows \"Six Feet Under\", \"Nip/Tuck\", \"The Tudors\", \"Queer as Folk\", and the HBO World War II miniseries \"The Pacific\". He has also written several films.\n\nIn 2014, he directed episodes five and six of the fifth season of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\", earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for the latter episode. He returned the next season, directing the season premiere and the second episode. He also directed the season premiere as well as the season finale of the seventh season.\n\nJeremy Podeswa was born in 1962 in Toronto, Ontario. He is Jewish, and his Polish Jewish father, a painter, was the only one of his immediate family to make it out of the German Nazi camps alive. He attended the Community Hebrew Academy of Toronto before graduating from Ryerson University's Film Studies program and the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies (now the AFI Conservatory). He has recently identified as queer and states that it is only one part of his identity: \n\n\"...my sexual orientation is one element among others. I believe that the experience of belonging to a minority, whether tied to sexual orientation, religion or race, changes your perspective you can have on of our environment and things in life. My orientation is only one part of me: I am Jewish, my parents are immigrants, I am North American. All these things and many others make what I am. It would be very restrictive, even a mistake, to say that my work or any other filmmaker’s can be reduced to the dimension of sexual orientation.\"\n\nHe was part of a loosely affiliated group of filmmakers to emerge in the 1980s from Toronto known as the Toronto New Wave.\n\nIn 1983, 21-year-old Podeswa used his student loans to make his first short film, titled \"David Roche Talks to You About Love\" —a 22-minute performance about a gay actor and his views on love. The aspiring director then took jobs as a production assistant, assistant editor and a publicist before he started directing his own films. During the eighties and nineties when he just started his career, he made Canadian indie shorts and features such as The Five Senses, Eclipse, and Fugitive Pieces (2008), loosely based on a novel by Anne Michael, which was awarded the opening night slot at the 2007 International Film Festival. The film has since received critical acclaim. Podeswa has recently made a name for himself directing critically acclaimed and commercially successful television shows, such as Six Feet Under, True Blood, Dexter, Game of Thrones and Queer as Folk. Though, he has been successful with his career making and directing TV shows, yet he wishes to go beyond than what he has now. \n\nAltogether, Jeremy Podeswa has won 20 awards while having 34 nominations for his expert works. Podeswa was given two Genie Awards in 2000 as Best Director of \"The Five Senses\", which was awarded Best Picture. He also won a Genie award in 1987, many years before, for having the Best Live Action Short Drama. Podeswa has also won a Broadcast Film Critics Association award for the Best Picture Made for Television. In addition, he won an award at NewFest: New York's LGBT Film Festival for the Best Short. Podeswa won an award at the Newport Beach Film Festival in 2008 for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. In addition he won Best Short at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. His most recent accomplishments occurred in 2015 and 2018, where he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Direction of a Drama Series with Game of Thrones. \n"}

{"id": "2016634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016634", "title": "Elisabeth of the Palatinate", "text": "Elisabeth of the Palatinate\n\nElisabeth of the Palatinate (26 December 1618 – 11 February 1680), also known as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate, or Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey, was the eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine (who was briefly King of Bohemia), and Elizabeth Stuart. Elisabeth of the Palatinate was a philosopher best known for her correspondence with René Descartes. She was critical of Descartes' dualistic metaphysics and her work anticipated the metaphysical concerns of later philosophers.\n\nElisabeth Simmern van Pallandt was born on December 26, 1618 in Heidelberg. She was the third of thirteen children and eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England and sister of Charles I.\n\nMuch of Elisabeth's early life outside of her familial relations is unknown. After a short, unsuccessful reign in Bohemia, Elisabeth's parents were forced into exile in the Netherlands in 1620. Elisabeth stayed with her grandmother Louise Juliana of Nassau in Heidelberg before moving to the Netherlands at the age of nine.\n\nElisabeth had a wide ranging education, studying philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, jurisprudence, history, modern and classical languages. Her siblings nicknamed her \"La Grecque\" (\"The Greek\") based on her skill with the ancient language.\n\nElisabeth also studied the fine arts including painting, music and dancing. She may have been tutored by Constantijn Huygens.\n\nIn 1633, Elisabeth received a proposal of marriage from Władysław IV Vasa, King of Poland. The marriage would have been beneficial to the Palatine fortunes, but the king was a Catholic, and Elisabeth refused to convert from her Protestant faith in order to facilitate the marriage.\n\nEdward Reynolds dedicated his \"Treatise on the passions and the faculties of the soule of man\" (1640) to Elisabeth. Although the exact context of the dedication is unknown, the dedication suggests that Elisabeth had seen a draft of the work.\n\nIn 1642, Elisabeth read Descartes' \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\n\nIn 1646, Elisabeth's brother Philip killed a man in a duel. Elisabeth was sent to stay with family in Germany where she tried to interest professors in Descartes' work.\n\nIn 1660, Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in 1667 she became abbess of the convent. While the convent was Lutheran, Elisabeth was a Calvinist. Although the previous abbess (Elisabeth's cousin) had also been a Calvinist, this difference in faith created some initial distrust.\n\nAs abbess, she presided over the convent and also governed the surrounding community of 7,000 people. While Elisabeth was abbess, the convent became a refuge from religious persecution for people and she welcomed more marginal religious sects, including the Labadists. When Robert Barclay's father David was imprisoned, Elisabeth intervened and helped to get him released.\n\nElisabeth died on February 12, 1680. She was buried in the Abbey Church of Herford.\n\nThroughout her adult years, Elisabeth corresponded with many renowned intellectuals of her time.\n\nBy 1639, Elisabeth was corresponding with Anna Maria van Schurman, a learned woman, called the Dutch Minerva. In an early letter van Schurman offered Elisabeth guidance on what subjects to study, arguing for the usefulness of history.\n\nElisabeth's correspondence with Descartes began in 1643 and continued until Descartes's death in early 1650. At her request, Descartes became her teacher in philosophy and morals, and in 1644 he dedicated to her his \"Principia\".\n\nMany of Descartes's letters to Elisabeth were published in the volumes of his correspondence edited by Claude Clerselier, but Elisabeth refused the request to publish her side of the exchange. Elisabeth's side of the correspondence was first published in 1879 by Louis-Alexandre Foucher de Careil, after he was alerted to its existence by an antiquarian bookseller, Frederick Müller, who had found a packet of letters in Rosendael.\n\nElisabeth also corresponded with a number of prominent Quakers, including Robert Barclay and William Penn.\n\nThere are letters written both by and to her concerning political and financial matters in the English Calendar of State Papers.\n\nSiblings\n\n\nElisabeth met Descartes on one of Descartes' visits to The Hague. Descartes visited The Hague to meet some of the leading intellectual figures in Holland who might support his philosophy. The Hague was often a gathering place to meet other influential, powerful people. As Descartes talked of his ideas, Elisabeth intently listened and became very interested in Descartes' thoughts of the mind and body. After Descartes' visit, it was told to him that Elisabeth had been very interested in his work. Descartes was flattered and told others that he would like to get to know the princess better. Descartes made another visit to The Hague, and was intent on having a conversation with Elisabeth, although this conversation for some reason did not happen.Elisabeth, upon hearing of Descartes' failed attempt to converse with her, wrote to Descartes a letter. In this letter, dated May 16, 1643, Elisabeth writes, \"tell me please how the soul of a human being (it being only a thinking substance) can determine the bodily spirits and so bring about voluntary actions\". Elisabeth is questioning Descartes' idea of dualism and how the soul and the body could interact. Elisabeth rightly questioned how something immaterial (Descartes' idea of the mind) could move something material (the body). Descartes replied to Elisabeth's letter with the answer that this interaction should not be thought of as between two bodies and that it is the kind of union that exists between the two qualities of heaviness and bodies.\n\nElisabeth was not satisfied with this answer, so she wrote to Descartes again. In this letter, dated June 20, 1643, Elisabeth writes that she cannot \"understand the idea through which we must judge how the soul (nonextended and immaterial) is able to move the body, that is, by that idea through which you have at another time understood heaviness ... And I admit that it would be easier for me to concede matter and extension to the mind than it would be for me to concede the capacity to move a body and be moved by one to an immaterial thing.\" Jaegwon Kim cites this as the first causal argument for the doctrine of physicalism in philosophy of mind. In another letter from Elisabeth to Descartes dated July 1, 1643, Elisabeth agrees with Descartes that our senses are evidence that the soul does move the body and the body moves the soul, but that this interaction does not teach us anything about how this happens. In Elisabeth's correspondence with Descartes, we can see that Elisabeth assumes that Descartes does have an account of how the soul and body interact and asks for clarification on how the soul does this. In fact, Descartes did not have an exact account of how this happens, but merely assumed the soul had this capability. This particular correspondence between Descartes and Elisabeth ended with this July 1 letter.\n\nThe correspondence began again, but two years later. In this correspondence, Elisabeth and Descartes discuss an illness Elisabeth suffered from in the summer of 1645. Descartes writes to Elisabeth that he thinks her symptoms are caused by sadness. This could very well have been true, as Elisabeth's brother Philip had challenged a family suitor and then stabbed the suitor in public, resulting in social backlash. This caused Elisabeth much distress and worry. Elisabeth originally intended the letters to be private and has no extant philosophical works. This makes her place in the history of philosophy complex and the subject of debate. This specific correspondence between Elisabeth and Descartes is often ignored by many historians, as they see it as insignificant, but a few regard it as influential in that Descartes and Elisabeth seem to be talking of the \"passions of the soul\", as Descartes referred to them. Some historians have remarked that Elisabeth could have been a philosopher in her own right if it had not been for a lack of a systematic presentation of her philosophical position.\n\nIn addition to Descartes, Elisabeth held correspondence with many others, including various Quakers. Among them most notably were Edward Reynolds, Nicholas Malebranche, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Robert Barclay, and William Penn. While they seemed to have the aim of converting her to their faith, Elisabeth seemed to be focused on the intellectual interest of their ideals and beliefs. She also held a correspondence for a time with the \"Dutch Minerva\", Anna Maria van Schurman, who encouraged Elisabeth to further her studies in history, physics, and astronomy. While their correspondence was not extensive, Van Schurman was a mentor to Elisabeth and guided her in her scholarly studies. She was respected and revered by Princess Elisabeth to a great degree. Elisabeth asked for her advice on new topics and subjects of study often. Van Schurman took the initiative in giving Elisabeth her opinion on the new discoveries of their time. The area in which they seemed to diverge was in their opinion of Descartes. Elisabeth was intrigued by the new Cartesian philosophy and wanted to learn more about it. Van Schurman, however, emphatically refuted the idea when Elisabeth inquired about it, instead defending the scholastic traditional view. As much as she respected Van Schurman, this did not stop Elisabeth from pursuing her interest in Descartes and his doctrine. It has been speculated that Elisabeth's correspondence and deep connection with Descartes effectively ended her communications with Van Schurman.\n\nElisabeth of Bohemia has been a key subject in the feminist history of philosophy. She has garnered attention as prominent female thinker and for her practical role in the development of 17th century female scholars. Feminist scholars study her correspondences and life to understand the limitations placed on 17th century female thinkers. Some scholars cite Elisabeth as an example of how philosophical conceptions of women as philosophers excluded them from the philosophical canon. For feminist scholars, her correspondence with Descartes presents an example of the value of including women in the canon. Some argue that Elisabeth's correspondence with Descartes helps feminist scholars re-conceptualize how women are to be included in the philosophical canon. Feminist scholars are concerned with how Elisabeth's gender informed her philosophy. Many believe that Elisabeth was keenly aware of the limitations of her sex. One scholar states that Elisabeth's health and femininity informed her interest about the immaterial soul's influence on the material body. Elisabeth's influence also extends to the development of other 17th century female thinkers. She utilized her exile court in The Hague to create a network of female scholars. Her network was a space where women could engage in philosophical inquiry through correspondence. Including Elisabeth, the network consisted of Anna Maria van Schurman, Marie de Gournay, and Lady Ranelagh.\n\n"}

While on a dig in Peru, (Hardy, like most Silver Age heroes, is a man of many interests and talents, including archeology), a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. While the others fled, Hardy followed a rare white jaguar into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster, as well as a mystical \"nucleon energy belt\".

The latter has two small rocket packs on either side which gives him the power of supersonic flight. He wears no mask and looks exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy has a mustache, while The Jaguar does not. (Post-Silver Age comics artists tend to give the latter pointed ears and a more cat-like hairstyle, making him vaguely resemble a cross between the Sub-Mariner and the movie version of Wolverine.)\n\nIn many ways The Jaguar is a copy of earlier Archie Comics hero The Fly: magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than the insect kingdom, etc. The Jaguar first appeared two years after The Fly was introduced.\n\nUnlike The Fly, however, The Jaguar is handsome and has many recurring romantic entanglements. These include the immortal feline sorceress Cat Girl, who had command over the cat kingdom, just as he ruled over the whole animal kingdom. (She was also known as The Sphinx and had originally battled The Fly, but it was quickly decided that she would be a more appropriate foe for The Jaguar.) There is also the green-skinned and white-haired undersea siren Kree-Nal, and Hardy's secretary Jill Ross. Like Pete Ross, she secretly knows that Hardy is her beloved hero The Jaguar and uses that knowledge to help him without him knowing it. Nor were these relationships static; in later stories, Jill left to study nursing so that she could better assist in Hardy's veterinary work.\n\nCat Girl lost her magic powers due to exposure to highly toxic strontium-90 from atomic testing, retaining only her telepathic mastery over cats. She took on the new mortal identity of jet-set socialite Lydia Fellin, whose \"family fortune\" was actually a vast treasure trove that she had accumulated over the centuries.\n\nThe Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of \"The Adventures of the Jaguar\", as well as a backup feature in other Archie titles: \"Jughead Jones Comic Digest\" 7; \"Laugh Comics\" 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140–142, 144; \"Laugh Comics Digest\" 25, 27; \"Pep Comics\" 150, 152, 157, 159, and 168. The Jaguar also appears in \"The Adventures of the Fly\" #23. When the \"Archie Adventure Series\" line was canceled and reborn as Archie's \"camped up\" Mighty Comics line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in \"Mighty Crusaders\" #4 and 5. In #5 The Jaguar would team up with Mr. Justice and Steel Sterling as the \"Terrific Three\".\n\nThe Jaguar would again appear as part of Archie's Red Circle Comics revamp in the 1980s, as a founding member of the new \"Mighty Crusaders\". He was also a backup series in \"The Fly\" issues 4–9. In this incarnation it was revealed that the source of The Jaguar's powers was the cherubim-like pre-human god Varigon, Lord of the Animals, a towering golden-winged being with three heads: a bird, a lion, and a bull. Varigon had created the magic belt as a weapon to be worn by his mortal champion in the eternal battle against the scaly green lizard-headed S'ithh, Lord of the Reptiles, who wanted the dinosaurs to rule the Earth once again. The first person to have worn the belt in ancient times was an Incan woman.\n\nIt is later revealed that Ralph is the brother of Rose Raymond, the wife of fellow superhero The Web.\n\nThe most recent appearances of the Ralph Hardy Jaguar have been cameos in \"Archie's Weird Mysteries\" #3 and 14 and a cover story crossover appearance in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" #30.\n\nA teenage female version of The Jaguar, written by William Messner-Loebs, was used in DC Comics' \"Impact\" revamp of the Archie superheroes. She is naive and good-hearted Maria DeGuzman, who came to North America from Rio de Janeiro to study at Elm Harbor University. To her surprise, she inherited from her late aunt the werewolf-like ability to transform into a large, muscular, barefoot and green-eyed Jaguar. Despite wearing a similar, somewhat skimpier skintight red outfit, unlike her male namesake, this ferocious feline's powers are limited to superhuman strength and agility combined with cat-like claws and senses. She eventually marries Impact's version of The Fly at the end of the \"Crucible\" miniseries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the continuity-altering Final Crisis, DC comics once again licensed the Red Circle heroes, this time choosing to bring them directly into the DC Universe. In March 2010 a new Jaguar was set to appear in \"The Shield\" #5, a Brazilian man who could transform into a red tattoo-covered \"werejaguar\".\n\nIn \"New Crusaders\" the role of The Jaguar in the short-lived Red Circle digital comics universe was passed to Ralph Hardy's young apprentice Ivette \"Ivy\" Velez when the shy, Spanish-speaking orphan was given the cat-like golden helmet of Ai Apaec to become the savage new Jaguar.\n\n"}

He was educated at Sydney before enrolling at Trinity College, Toronto, in 1854. Although he was a good student, he left the university two years later and worked as a parliamentary reporter for a Toronto newspaper. In 1860, he was in Halifax, where he founded, together with Joseph C. Crosskill, his own newspaper, the \"Evening Reporter\". In May 1867, Bourinot left this newspaper and worked as a freelance writer for some time, until he secured a job as a clerk at the Senate of Canada in May 1869. In the following years, he steadily advanced through various grades until he was appointed chief clerk of the House of Commons of Canada in December 1880. a post he would occupy until his death 22 years later.\n\nA founding member of the Royal Society of Canada, he also acted as its honorary secretary, and in 1892 served as president of the society. He wrote many books political history, some of which were considered references for decades to come. His \"Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in Canada\" (Montréal, 1884) is considered a standard work, and was cited as recently as 24 October 2013 by the Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable Noel Kinsella. \"How Canada is governed\" (Toronto, 1895) was a widely used textbook, and \"Canada under British rule, 1760 – 1900\" (Cambridge, England, 1900) was also popular. He also wrote books about the history of Nova Scotia, and several more on constitutional law. He also created the work that was posthumously to be called \"Bourinot's Rules of Order\".\n\nBourinot was an advocate of Imperial Federation and a proponent of both a national university and library of Canada. He also was in favour of the right of women to higher education. In his later life, Bourinot received honorary degrees from many Canadian universities and was created CMG in 1890 and KCMG in 1898. He died in Ottawa, Ontario and was buried in Beechwood Cemetery there.\n\nBourinot was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2016702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016702", "title": "HMS Glatton (1795)", "text": "HMS Glatton (1795)\n\nHMS \"Glatton\" was a 56-gun fourth rate of the Royal Navy. Wells & Co. of Blackwell launched her on 29 November 1792 for the British East India Company (EIC) as the East Indiaman \"Glatton\". The Royal Navy bought her in 1795 and converted her into a warship. \"Glatton\" was unusual in that for a time she was the only ship-of-the-line that the Royal Navy had armed exclusively with carronades. (Eventually she returned to a more conventional armament of guns and carronades.) She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, and as a transport for convicts to Australia. She then returned to naval service in the Mediterranean. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Admiralty converted her to a water depot at Sheerness. In 1830 the Admiralty converted \"Glatton\" to a breakwater and sank her at Harwich.\n\nIn 1793-4 \"Glatton\" made one round trip to China for the East India Company. Her captain was Charles Drummond and her First Lieutenant was William Macnamarra. Drummond had commanded an earlier \"Glatton\" and would command a later one too; Macnamarra too would go on to command a later \"Glatton\" on a trip to China for the Company.\n\n\"Glatton\"s letter of marque was dated 22 August 1793. The letter of marque permitted her, while under Drummond's command, to assist in the capture of the French brig \"Le Franc\". It was issued after \"Glatton\" had left Portsmouth on 22 May 1793. \"Glatton\" was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen \"Prince William\", \"Lord Thurlow\", \"William Pitt\", , \"Earl of Oxford\", , \"Fort William\", \"London\", , , \"Marquis of Landsdown\", , , and \"Earl of Abergavenny\", amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.\n\nFrom Portsmouth, \"Glatton\" reached Manilla on 10 November, and then Whampoa two weeks later. On her return voyage, she crossed Second Bar on 17 February 1794, reached St Helena on 18 June, and Long Reach by 12 September.\n\nThe next East Indiaman \"Glatton\", also sailing with a letter of marque, captured a Dutch prow in the Straits of Flores in 1796, and the ship \"Copenhagen\" in 1799.\n\nCaptain Henry Trollope commissioned her in April 1795 and he was responsible for arranging that her original armament consisted entirely of carronades instead of the standard mix of long guns and carronades that other warships carried. His previous command, some eight years earlier, had been the 44-gun \"Rainbow\", which too had been armed entirely with carronades. With her Trollope had in 1782 taken the \"Hébé\", which the British would go to use as the model for the \"Leda\"-class frigates.\n\nCarronades had short, relatively thin barrels and so were half the weight of the equivalent cannon. They did not need as large gun crews and could also fire much heavier shot for their weight than a gun of the same overall weight, but at the cost of the accuracy, velocity and range of the shot. This extremely heavy armament meant that the fourth rate \"Glatton\" could discharge a heavier broadside than the first rate \"Victory\". But, in combat \"Glatton\" would have to endure the fire of the enemy's long guns while closing the gap to point-blank range before she could effectively return fire — if indeed the enemy would allow her to approach so close.\n\n\"Glatton\" was originally armed with twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck and twenty-eight 42-pounder carronades on her upper deck. All were non-recoil, which is to say that they were fixed to the deck. Within a month 32-pounder carronades replaced the 42-pounders. However, \"Glatton's\" ports were too small to allow the larger guns to traverse properly, and she had no bow or stern chasers. Her guns therefore could only be pointed straight out the side. The month after the action in July 1796 (see below), she received two 32-pounders and two 18-pounder carronades for her forecastle. Later, the Navy replaced the twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck with twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns, ending the experiment.\n\nTrollope was extremely happy with \"Glatton\"s seaworthiness, handling and general fitting out. He wrote to John Wells, the shipbuilder and her former owner, \"I sincerely hope... we may meet with a seventy four in the Glatton...she would either take her or sink her in twenty minutes.\"\n\nUnder Trollope, \"Glatton\" first served in the English Channel where she engaged a French squadron on 15 July 1796. The French squadron consisted of a 50-gun ship, five frigates (two of 36 guns and three of 28), a brig, and a cutter. \"Glatton\" drove the French vessels into Flushing, having lost only two men wounded, one of whom died later, and despite having at times been surrounded by the enemy and exchanging fire at less than 20 yards. The French vessels may have included \"Brutus\" (a 74-gun cut down to 46-50 guns), \"Incorruptible\" (50 guns), \"Magicienne\" (32 guns), and \"Républicaine\", and one French vessel apparently sank in Flushing harbour. (It was in this action that Captain Strangeways of the Royal Marines sustained the wound of which he died shortly thereafter, and which the illustration above commemorates.)\n\nIn March–April 1797, Trollope kept \"Glatton\"s crew from joining the Nore mutiny. By threatening to fire on the 64-gun and the 40-gun , which were in open mutiny, he convinced their crews to return to duty. In August Captain Charles Cobb took command.\n\nIn April and May 1798 \"Glatton\" participated, with many other vessels, in the capture of sundry Dutch doggers, schuyts, and fishing vessels. On 4 and 5 May \"Glatton\" was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutters \"Fox\" and \"Marshall Cobourg\", though most were much larger and included , , , , among others. On 28 May \"Glatton\", , \"Ganges\", \"America\", , , \"Director\", , the hired armed cutters \"Fox the First\", and \"Rose\" when they captured \"Janus\". \nAll the British vessels were part of the fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Duncan. Next, many of the same vessels, including \"Glatton\", , \"Fox the First\" and \"Rose\", captured several more Dutch vessels:\n\nOn 18 August 1798, \"Glatton\", \"Veteran\", \"Belliqueux\", \"Monmouth\", , \"Ganges\", , , the sloop , and the hired armed cutter \"Rose\" captured \"Adelarde\".\n\n\"Glatton\" was with other ships from Duncan's fleet, including , , , the hired armed lugger \"Rover\", and cutters \"Liberty\" and \"Hazard\", when they captured \"Harmenie\" on 21 April 1799. \"Glatton\" was in company with \"Kent\", , and when they captured the Dutch hoy \"Johanna\" on 16 May 1799.\n\nThen in August 1799, \"Glatton\" participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. The expedition was under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan and the Duke of York. Some 250 craft of all sizes transported 17,000 troops from Margate Roads and the Downs across the Channel on 13 August. Due to bad weather it was 21 August before they anchored off Kijkduin. The next day Vice Admiral Mitchell sent a summons to Vice Admiral Samuel Story, calling on him to surrender his fleet. When he declined, the Duke of York landed his army near Den Helder on 27 August under covering fire from the fleet. Den Helder was occupied the following day when the garrison evacuated the town. The expedition then took possession of 13 old warships laid up in ordinary. On 30 August, \"Glatton\", , , \"Veteran\", , \"Belliqueux\", \"Monmouth\" and \"Overyssel\", the Russian ship \"Mistisloff\" and the frigates, anchored in line ahead in the Vlieter and Mitchel again summoned Story. This time Story agreed to surrender his squadron of 12 modern warships. The Royal Navy purchased 11 of these. The Dutch surrender, without any resistance, became known as the Vlieter Incident. As a result of the surrender, Duncan's fleet was awarded prize money, in which \"Glatton\" shared.\n\nOn 15 January 1800 a court martial on board \"Glatton\", in Yarmouth Roads, tried Lieutenant James Watson, and the surviving officers and crew for the loss on the Cockle Sands of the 12-gun brig as she left Yarmouth Roads via the Northern Passage for Leith. Eight of the crew had been lost in the incident. The court absolved Watson, his officers, and men for the loss of the vessel, and praised their conduct after the wrecking.\n\nIn November, Captain George Stephen took command of \"Glatton\", followed in 1801 by Captain William Bligh, formerly of HMS \"Bounty\". Bligh was only captain for about a month, but during that month he sailed her to the Baltic where \"Glatton\" participated in the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The battle cost her 17 killed and 34 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty would award the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Copenhagen 1801\" to all surviving claimants from the action.\n\n\"Glatton\" was next under Captain William Nowell and then under Captain William Birchall. In August 1801 she was fitted at Sheerness for a guardship in protected waters. Captain John Ferris Devonshire took command that same month.\n\nCaptain Nathaniel Porlock recommissioned her in May 1802 as a convict ship. Next, Commander James Colnett assumed command and on 23 September \"Glatton\" left England, carrying over 270 male, and 135 female prisoners; of these, seven men and five women died on the journey. She also carried some 30 Free Settlers. A family from the Royal Household boarded the Glatton - this was one of the reasons a Royal Navy vessel was used, to ensure a safe passage. She sailed via a resupply stop at Rio de Janeiro to the penal settlement at Sydney, where she arrived on 13 March 1803. When \"Glatton\" arrived about 100 of the people on board her were suffering to varying degrees from scurvy.\n\nShe then returned to England, arriving on 22 September 1803, that is, after an absence of 364 days. Because she returned via Cape Horn, she had circumnavigated the world; her actual time at sea for this transit was 277 days.\n\n\"Glatton\" was one of only two Royal Navy ships used to transport convicts to Port Jackson.\n\nBetween November and December 1803 she was refitted at Woolwich for service as a man-of-war. Still under Colnett's command, she then served briefly as flagship for Rear Admiral James Vashon.\n\nIn 1804 \"Glatton\" was reduced to a 44-gun fifth rate. On 11 November she, together with , , , , \"Africiane\", , , the hired armed cutter \"Swift\", and the hired armed lugger \"Agnes\", shared in the capture of \"Upstalsboom\", H.L. De Haase, Master.\n\nCaptain Thomas Seccombe recommissioned \"Glatton\" in March 1806 and sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 November. On 19 February 1807, \"Glatton\" captured the Turkish vessels \"San Giovanni Pidomias\" and \"Codro Mariolo\". That same day \"Glatton\" and captured the \"San Michelle\". Four days later, \"Hirondelle\" captured \"Madonna\", with \"Glatton\" sharing by agreement. On 26 February \"Hirondelle\" captured the \"San Nicollo\", and \"Glatton\" again shared by agreement.\n\nOn 1 March, boats from \"Glatton\" cut out a former French corvette in Turkish service from the port of Sigri on the island of Mitylene. The vessel was pierced for 18 guns but only 10 were mounted. The British boarding party lost five officers and men killed and nine men wounded. provided support.\n\nThe next day \"Glatton\" and \"Hirondelle\" captured three other Turkish vessels, names unknown but with masters, Statio, Constantine, and Papeli. Prize money for these vessels, and \"San Michelle\", was paid in October 1816.\n\nOn 4 March \"Glatton\" and \"Hirondelle\" captured another Turkish vessel. One week later, \"Glatton\" captured yet another Turkish vessel, name unknown, Ibrahim, master.\n\nThen on 29 November \"Glatton\" captured several transports off Corfu that were transferring troops from Otranto to Corfu. \"Glatton\" removed some 300 troops before she destroyed the nine vessels they had been on. Two vessels escaped back to Otranto.\n\n\"Glatton\" and the brig-sloop had received information that the French had captured four Sicilian gunboats and taken them into Scylla, near Reggio, Calabria. On 31 January 1808, as \"Delight\" approached the port, a strong current pushed her towards the shore and she grounded. Seccombe went on board \"Delight\" to supervise the recovery effort. As they were trying to free \"Delight\", her boats and those of \"Glatton\" came under intense fire from the shore. The boats were unsuccessful in freeing \"Delight\", and \"Delight\"s captain, Commander Phillip Crosby Handfield, late of \"Egyptienne\", and many of his crew were killed. Although the crew took to the boats, not all were able to escape and a number of the men on her, including Seccombe, became prisoners of war. The French paroled Seccombe, who had been severely wounded, to Messina, where he died on 3 February 1808.\n\n\"Glatton\" came under the command of Commander Henry Hope (acting) and in March 1808 under Commander Charles Irving (acting). Captain George Miller Bligh then took command around December. He brought a convoy home from Malta in July and then sailed her to Sheerness for laying up in October. She sailed briefly to the Baltic in 1811.\n\nFrom 1812 to 1814 \"Glatton\" was under R. G. Peacock (master) at Portsmouth. In 1814 she was converted to serve as a water depot at Sheerness. Between April and June 1830 she was fitted at Sheerness as a breakwater, and in October 1830 \"Glatton\" sailed for the last time, to Harwich, where she was subsequently scuttled to serve as a breakwater.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

According to the European External Action Service, the EU and China relations aim for cooperation in the areas of \"peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges.\" The EU is the PRC's largest trading partner, and the PRC and the ROC are the EU's second and fifteenth largest trade partners after the United States, while the EU has put an arms embargo and numerous anti-dumping measures against the PRC in place.\n\nIn the jointly adopted EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation of 2013, the EU reaffirmed its respect for China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while the PRC reaffirmed its support to EU integration. An annual EU-China Summit is being held each year to discuss political and economic relations as well as global and regional issues.\n\nRelations are governed by the 1985 EU-China \"Trade and Cooperation Agreement\". Since 2007, negotiations have been underway to upgrade this to a new European Union Association Agreement and there are already 24 sectoral dialogues and agreements from environmental protection to education.\n\nPrior to the existence of the European Community, many European states had relations with the Qing dynasty as far as the 19th century.\n\nIn 1979, just after the first direct elections to the European Parliament, the later institution established the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China (D–CN).\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, relations with Europe were not as high a priority for China as its relations with the US, Japan and other Asian powers. However interest in closer relations started to rise as economic contacts increased and interest in a multipolar system grew. Although initially imposing an arms embargo on China after Tiananmen (see \"arms embargo\" section below), European leaders eased off China's isolation. China's growing economy became the focus for many European visitors and in turn Chinese businessmen began to make frequent trips to Europe. Europe's interest in China led to the EU becoming unusually active with China during the 1990s with high-level exchanges. EU-Chinese trade increased faster than the Chinese economy itself, tripling in ten years from USD14.3 billion in 1985 to USD45.6 billion in 1994.\n\nHowever political and security co-operation was hampered with China seeing little chance of headway there. Europe was leading the desire for NATO expansion and intervention in Kosovo, which China opposed as it saw them as extending US influence. However, by 2001 China moderated its anti-US stance in the hopes that Europe would cancel its arms embargo but pressure from the US led to the embargo remaining in place. Due to this, China saw the EU as being too weak, divided and dependent on the US to be a significant power. Even in the economic sphere, China was angered at protectionist measures against its exports to Europe and the EU's opposition to giving China the status of market economy in order to join the WTO.\n\nHowever, economic cooperation continued, with the EU's \"New Asia Strategy\", the first Asia–Europe Meeting in 1996, the 1998 EU-China summit and frequent policy documents desiring closer partnerships with China. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis dampened investors enthusiasm, China weathered the crisis well and continued to be a major focus of EU trade. Chinese leaders were anxious to return the European interest and made high level visits throughout the 1990s, visits that were accompanied by major EU sales to China. Trade in 1993 saw a 63% increase from the previous year. China became Europe's fourth largest trading partner at this time. Even following the financial crisis in 1997, EU-Chinese trade increased by 15% in 1998.\n\nFrance was leading the EU's desire for closer ties in order to establish a multipolar world and was the first, along with Russia, to establish strategic partnerships with China. Relations between the European Union and China have experienced a cool down after China canceled the EU-China yearly summit in November 2008. This was apparently caused due to French President Sarkozy's plans to meet with the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, adopted in 2013, calls for cooperation in the areas of \"peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges.\" In 2016, the EU adopted the \"Joint Communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China\" as its strategy on China.\n\nOn the 16th of October 2018, the European Union Naval Force and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy held for the first time ever a joint military exercise. The exercise took place at a Chinese military base in Djibouti and was completed successfully. Rear Admiral Alfonso Perez De Nanclares said that preparations for future exercises with the Chinese Navy are currently taking place.\n\nChina sent medical aid and supplies to EU countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is \"a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the ‘politics of generosity’.\" Borrell also said that \"China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.\"\n\nThe EU is China's largest trading partner, and China is the EU's second largest trade partner after the United States. Most of this trade is in industrial and manufactured goods. Between 2009 and 2010 alone EU exports to China increased by 38% and China's exports to the EU increased by 31%.\n\nIn 2016, the EU-China bilateral trade in goods were €514.8 billion. Machinery and vehicles dominate both exports and imports. The top five exports of China are computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones, office machine parts and integrated circuits. China's top five imports are crude petroleum, integrated circuits, iron ore, gold and cars.\nFor what concerns the EU imports of AMA/NAMA product groups the part for industrial products counts for a value of €343.725 million and gets the impressive percentage of 98.1% (of a total of €350.535 million). The same applies for exports to China where industrial products keep the highest ranking in the list and count for €159,620 million (93.7% of the total export volume).\n\nTrade of services play an important role in all modern economies. A resilient tertiary service sector, as well as an increased availability of services, may boost economic growth and enhance industrial performance. In an increasingly localised world, services such as finance, insurance, transport, logistics and communications deliver key intermediate inputs and thereby provide crucial support to the rest of the economy.\nThe European Union representing its 28 Member States and China are both members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and participate in the ongoing discussions about the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). The volume of trade in services of all participating countries corresponds to 70% of the world's total volume. TiSA is an important tool to increase the share of services trade by tackling the existing barriers. With TiSA new opportunities for service providers will be offered while fostering growth, jobs and prosperity at all participating Members.\nAccording to the latest statistical information from Eurostat, the EU trade in services balance with China in 2015 present a surplus of €10.3 billion due to a surge of exports (exports reached €36 billion while imports €25.7 billion).\n\nThe SSTL project was launched in 2006 as a pilot project between the European Union and China as the first Asian country. The participating EU member states at the time were the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As from 2010 (when the second phase of the project was launched) other EU member states joined: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain. This project tests safety and security related recommendations of the World Customs Organisation Framework of Standards applied to containers, facilitating the \"Customs-to-Customs\" data exchange, risk management cooperation, mutual recognition of customs controls and trade partnership programmes. The 120 trade lanes involving 200 economic operators between 16 maritime ports will undoubtedly facilitate trade between China and EU participating countries as loading and unloading of containers will require less controls and intervention of Customs authorities.\n\nThere have been some disputes, such as the dispute over textile imports into the EU (see below). China and the EU are increasingly seeking cooperation, for example China joined the Galileo project investing €230 million and has been buying Airbus planes in return for a construction plant to be built in China; in 2006 China placed an order for 150 planes during a visit by French President Jacques Chirac. Also, despite the arms embargo, a leaked US diplomatic cable suggested that in 2003 the EU sold China €400 million of \"defence exports\" and later, other military grade submarine and radar technology.\n\nChina and the EU launched their first science and technology cooperation program in 1983. They also drafted an Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation in 1998 which was renewed in 2004 with the aim of linking research organisations, industry, universities and individual researchers in specific projects supported by the EU budget.\nThe current cooperation of the EU and China in the area of science and technology has been made available by the Horizon 2020 program. The Horizon 2020 initiative by the European Commission addresses the following areas: (i) food, agriculture and biotechnology (FAB); (ii) sustainable urbanization; (iii) energy; (iv) aeronautics; (v) and other areas including ICT, water, health, society, polar research, sme instrument, and space.\n\nDuring the European debt crisis, several European countries required the EU and International Monetary Fund bailouts. China assisted Europe by buying billions of euros' worth of junk Eurozone bonds; in particular from Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Some analysts suggested China was buying political influence in the EU but China maintains they are building strong trade ties and supporting the European economy so that trade issues can move ahead more smoothly.\nThere is a dispute over textile imports into the EU (the Bra wars) with domestic European manufactures losing out to cheaper Chinese imported goods. The EU and China have finally reached an agreement ending the 'conflict of textiles', which poisoned their relations for several weeks. Both parties (the Chinese government on the one hand, European Commission on the other) have finally found a deal that appears to end the dispute between Beijing and Brussels. Under the terms of the agreement, China agreed, in exchange for the release of 80 million items held in European ports, only half of these are deducted from its export quotas for 2006.\n\nThe EU has put in place numerous anti-dumping measures to protect its market from cheap products from China, especially steel.\n\nThe EU arms embargo on China was imposed by the EU on China in response to its suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. China stated its position that the embargo be removed, describing it \"very puzzling\" and amounting to \"political discrimination\". In January 2010, China again requested that the embargo be removed.\n\nA leaked US cable indicated the internal divisions in the EU on the ban during negotiations in 2004. France viewed the ban as anachronistic and refused to consider attaching reforms in China as a condition, stating that \"China would not accept human rights conditionality.\" Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Greece, Italy and the UK were all broadly in the French camp. Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden wished to attach a lifting of the ban to \"specific Chinese steps on human rights.\" All agreed in principle that if certain conditions were met then the ban should be lifted. Various EU heads of state have objected to the embargo or supported its continued existence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has previously indicated her opposition to a lifting of the embargo, whereas her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, had been in favour.\n\nThe European Parliament has been consistently against removing the embargo. However, High Representative Catherine Ashton put forward plans for lifting the embargo in 2010, arguing that \"The current arms embargo is a major impediment for developing stronger EU-China co-operation on foreign policy and security matters.\" Chinese ambassador to the EU Song Zhe agreed, noting that \"it doesn't make any sense to maintain the embargo.\"\n\nThe United States, which also has an arms embargo on China, states that lifting the embargo will create a technology transfer that will increase the capabilities of the Chinese army. The US has been influential in keeping the EU ban in place. The US sees China as a potential military threat and has pressured the EU in keeping it in place. In 2011 the Chinese EU ambassador suggested that in the future \"the EU should make decisions on its own.\"\n\nSimilarly, Japan is equally as against any attempt to remove arms restrictions to China. Japan's government, particularly right-wing members of the cabinet, indicate that any such move will alter the balance of power in Southeast Asia strongly in favour of China at Japan's expense. China described Japan's position as provocative. Meanwhile, Japan stated that the EU's proposal to lift the embargo in 2010 was a mistake in which caused great concern to Japan.\n\nWhilst the embargo remains, China buys much of its arms from Russia. China had turned to Israel for surveillance planes in 2007, but under pressure from the U.S., Israel refused to go through with the deal. Despite the ban, another leaked US cable suggested that in 2003 the EU sold €400 million of \"defence exports\" to China, and later approved other sales of military grade submarine and radar technology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016723", "title": "Redbud Woods controversy", "text": "Redbud Woods controversy\n\nThe Redbud Woods controversy was a dispute between protesters and the administration of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York over the demolition of a patch of woodlands known as the \"Redbud Woods.\" The area received this name because of the many Redbud trees that grew there and whose blossoms gave the woods a pink tint in the springtime. The website of Cornell University Plantations contained, on September 3, 2005, a description of the woods, and used the name Redbud Woods, so it had some official status at Cornell under this name.\n\nEarly in Cornell's history, at the turn of the 20th century, banker and hardware magnate Robert H. Treman, Class of 1878, built his family estate on University Hill, just west of today's West Campus. Treman hired his friend Warren Manning, a pioneer of American landscape architecture, to design the site. The \"Ithaca Daily News\" of November 2, 1901 reported that the west lawn would be \"left to nature as the best gardener.\" Upon his death in 1937, Treman, who preserved all of the Ithaca area's gorges, donated $5000 to the University specifically for the beautification of the campus. Much of his west lawn grew into the Redbud Woods, which retains many original Manning design elements and boasts locally rare yellow oak and hackberry trees as well as an unusually dense stand of redbuds.\n\nRedbud Woods was part of the landscaping of Robert H. Treman's historic estate. In the late 19th century Warren Manning designed the landscape of the Treman family estate (now Von Cramm Hall, 660, and the Kahin Center) so that it would grow into natural woodlands and beautify the campus. The woods, if left to grow untouched, might eventually reach the stage of a climax forest. Over time, Redbud Woods became perceived as a buffer between the University and the surrounding community.\n\nIn 1970, the University proposed to construct a parking lot behind Von Cramm Hall. However, this proposal was dropped after by protests led by Gordon G. Chang.\n\nAs part of its \"West Campus Residential Initiative,\" Cornell decided to relocate approximately 176 parking spots to the area occupied by the Redbud Woods, about 2 blocks from the new dorms. However, in 2001, the Ithaca Common Council named Redbud Woods a historic district. The University sued the city, and in 2005, the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate division ruled in Cornell's favor, allowing construction of the parking lot to proceed.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, then University President Jeffrey Lehman had presented three challenges to the University, the third of which was sustainability. Lehman went on to more fully articulate Cornell's \"institutional commitment to sustainability.\" Some, including many Cornell faculty, students and Ithaca community members, argued that paving a historic urban green space for a surface parking lot was unsustainable. They suggested that parking needs might be satisfied elsewhere on campus and be further mitigated through demand management, promotion of public transit, and planning.\n\nThose in opposition to construction of the lot also argued that paving the woods might increase localized flooding and allow for the leakage of toxic materials, for example motor oil, into the storm sewer system and ultimately into Cayuga Lake, which supplies drinking water for many living in Tompkins County.\n\nMajor protests around the construction of the parking lot continued through the summer of 2005, including the occupation of President Jeffrey Lehman's office on April 28, 2005 by eight students, as well as a protracted direct action occupation of the woods themselves by students, faculty, and community members, in opposition to what appeared to be imminent destruction. Notably, former Ithaca mayor, and Cornell professor emeritus, Ben Nichols was cited during protests against the deforestation plan. \n\nOn July 18, 2005, Cornell University interim president Hunter Rawlings visited Redbud Woods and signed an agreement between the University and many of the Redbud protesters, effectively ending the dispute, although some independent protests continued. Along with a pledge by Cornell to offer free travel passes for buses to all new students entering the University in the fall of 2005 and 2006 who did not purchase parking permits, the agreement included commitments on the university's part to involve the community more in administration decisions, as well as to engage in constructive dialogue concerning sustainability on campus. By August 2005 several thousand new students had taken advantage of the free travel passes, which helped to raise demand on the Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit bus system that services Ithaca and the rest of the county\n\n\"The New York Times\" published three articles about the Redbud Woods controversy in June and July 2005. Locally, \"The Ithaca Journal\" and the \"Cornell Daily Sun\" published many articles over the course of 2004–2005 about the protests.\n\nA key point in the negotiated agreement signed by student protesters (but not community members) was that\nstudents receive free travel passes to encourage sustainable transportation. Cornell began this process for \nincoming students during the semester immediately following the occupation for incoming students, adding to\nfree passes which were already provided to transfer and graduate students. Two years later, free passes\nfor graduate, transfer, and sophomore students were eliminated, and the program only offered going forward to\nfirst year students.\nA faculty and community committee proposed a memorial\nplaque to the Ithaca Common Council in early 2006, to be placed on public land adjacent to\nthe parking lot. Despite opposition from Cornell University, the City of Ithaca approved\nthe plaque on July 5, 2006, and it was installed later that year. The plaque reads:\nRedbud Woods\n\nThe land before you was once home to the extended family of Robert H. \nTreman, creator of parks and protector of green spaces throughout Tompkins \nCounty. The woodland that grew up here was inhabited for decades by diverse \nfauna and more than fifty plant species, including numerous redbud trees. \nRedbud Woods was razed on July 20, 2005 by the Cornell administration to \nbuild a parking lot.\n\nThis plaque has been erected by Ithaca community members in memory of this \ncherished woodland.\n\n<poem>\nRemember the trees…\nRemember all who tried to save them.\n</poem>\n"}

Family owned for seven generations, the company's main products are mid-priced to high-end kitchen knives for domestic and professional use. Wüsthof is one of the leading manufacturers of chef's knives. \n\nWüsthof's \"Classic\" and \"Grand Prix\" series have been recognized as top-rated knife series by Consumer Reports. \n\nAll Wüsthof knives are made in Solingen, where around 400 of the company's 480 employees work. Wüsthof's trademark is a trident in a circle. The brand is sold in over 80 countries worldwide. In North America, traditionally the largest market for Wüsthof products, the company operates two local distribution subsidiaries.\n\nJohann Abraham Wüsthof's Solingen \"”Shears factory, steel and iron works”\" is first mentioned in local records in 1814. The factory, one of many of its kind at the time, operated out of a so-called ‘Kotten’, a small grinding workshop with water-driven grindstones. In the early years, Wüsthof worked on commission for larger firms and did not yet have its own trademark. Johann Abraham's son, Eduard Wüsthof, introduced pocket knives as a second mainstay product in 1836. The 1869 company directory listed the firm's purpose as \"”Factory and warehouse for all kinds of forged shears, pocket and penknives, daggers, table knives and forks, bread, vegetable, butcher knives, etc.”\"\nEduard's sons, Robert and Eduard, moved the company to the premises the headquarters occupy today, and built a steam engine-powered factory that began production around 1880. In 1881, Robert Wüsthof took a selection of shears and pocket knives to New York and established the company's first trade relationship with the USA.\n\nIn 1895, the trident was registered with the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin as the company's trademark. Brand recognition rose as Wüsthof showcased at industrial and commercial exhibitions both at home and abroad, such as the 1902 Düsseldorf exhibition; production increased and further diversified, with facilities for nickel-plating and separate divisions for razor blades, scissors and cutlery. The 1904 Wüsthof catalogue shows, amongst other wares, 1125 different models of pocket knives on 48 pages. In the 1930s, knife production was switched to stainless steel.\n\nAlthough Solingen was heavily destroyed towards the end of World War II, the Wüsthof plant remained mostly intact, and production was resumed soon after the war ended. However, the firm's outdated equipment and reliance on manual labour proved to be a liability; in the 1970s, Wüsthof replaced the old factory building with new facilities with partially-automated production lines, removing pocket knives, shears and cutlery from its product range and concentrating on knives for professional and home use. In 1986, the first robot was installed in the Wüsthof factory.\n\nIn 1987, \"Wusthof-Trident of America, Inc.\" was founded to serve the company's most important export market. Its sister company, \"Wusthof-Trident of Canada\", was established in 2012.\n\nIn 2002 and 2014 the second and third production facilities, located in Lindgesfeld (the Solingen business park), came into operation, and in 2019, Wüsthof opened its first branded store, also in Solingen.\n\nWüsthof knives have been made in Solingen by the family-owned operation since 1814. The company is currently headed by cousins Harald Wüsthof and Viola Wüsthof. It operates three production facilities and an R&D department in the “City of Blades”, where all Wüsthof knives are designed and manufactured.\n\nThe company's international distribution network comprises over 80 countries; around 80 % of Wüsthof's revenues are generated outside Germany. In the US and Canada, distribution is coordinated by the subsidiaries \"Wusthof Trident of America Inc.\" (WUSA), headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, and \"Wusthof Trident of Canada\" (WCAN), located in Ottawa.\n\nWüsthof regularly exhibits at international trade fairs such as Maison et Objet (Paris), Ambiente (Frankfurt), International Home + Housewares Show (Chicago) or Spring Fair (Birmingham).\n\nThe Wüsthof production facilities in Solingen are highly automated, with more than 100 robots performing many steps in the knife-making process, while specific tasks such as the finishing of the edges and surfaces, and the final honing of the blade, are still completed manually.\n\nMost Wüsthof knives are precision-forged, except for the laser-cut (stamped) \"Gourmet\", \"Silverpoint\" and \"Urban Farmer\" series. Forged and stamped knives differ in the steps employed to manufacture the knife blanks: the basic shape and the integral bolster of forged blades are precision forged in a die at 2200 ℉ (1200 °C) and then hardened at 1920 ℉ (1500 °C), while stamped blanks are laser-cut from a stainless steel plate. Wüsthof forged knives have more than 40 steps in their manufacturing process; stamped Wüsthof knives have 14. For blade sharpening, Wüsthof employs its proprietary automated \"PEtec\" procedure (“Precision Edge technology”): the optimum tilt of the blade during the automated sharpening process is computed based on individual laser measurements of each blade, thus ensuring consistent results. German-style knives are sharpened to an angle of 14 degrees per side; Japanese-style knives are sharpened to an angle of 10 degrees per side.\n\nAll Wüsthof knives, except for the \"Silverpoint\" series (made with steel grade X46Cr13), have the formula “X50CrMoV15” etched into their blade, signifying that the single block of corrosion resistant steel alloy it is made from contains 0.5% carbon, 15% chromium and unspecified smaller amounts of molybdenum and vanadium. X50CrMoV15 is the German DIN standard name of the alloy, with material number (W-Nr standard) 1.4116.\n\n\n\nWüsthof offers a variety of products for honing and sharpening knives. The product range comprises honing steels in various lengths with handle designs to match some of the knife series, steel sharpeners coated with industrial diamonds, sharpeners with a ceramic shaft, whetstones and ceramic knife-sharpeners with pre-set angles.\n\nFor knife storage, Wüsthof sells knife blocks, magnetic holders and organisers for use in drawers, as well as hard and soft cases, roll-up bags and blade guards for transport. The company also offers cutting bases made from wood and thermoplastic polyurethane.\n\nBoth the \"Classic\" and \"Grand Prix\" lines were the top rated knives in a test of knives by Consumer Reports in November 2005, and are consistently given high ratings by Cook's Illustrated magazine. The 16 cm Chef's knife from the \"Classic\" series has been voted best chef's knife in 2019 by Ideal Home magazine. \n\nWüsthof has received several Housewares Design Awards in the cutlery category. The 12 cm Asian Utility Knife (2018), the 18 cm Ultimate Everyday Knife (2017), the 23 cm Double Serrated Bread Knife (2014) and the 29 cm Panini Knife (2008), all from the \"Classic\" series, were each rated best in category in the respective years.\n\nWüsthof is an official partner of and supplier to the German (\"Verband der Kȍche Deutschlands\") and Japanese (\"All Japan Chefs Association\") Chefs Associations. In this capacity, it acts as a supplier to the national chef teams of both countries.\n\nWüsthof collaborates with famous chefs worldwide, including Martha Stewart (\"Classic\" range), Gordon Ramsay (\"Classic Ikon\" range), Jamie Oliver (both \"Classic\" and \"Ikon\"), James Martin (\"Culinar\"), Michael Cox, and Emeril Lagasse (\"Emeril\"), who endorse and use Wüsthof knives.\n\n"}

It was the first Soviet nuclear missile that could be launched from a submerged submarine, and also had twice the range of earlier missiles. It replaced the R-11FM and R-13 (SS-N-4) on many Golf and Hotel-class submarines, and was in turn superseded by the R-27 (SS-N-6 'Serb') missile carried by Yankee-class submarines.\n\nDevelopment of the R-15 and R-21 was initially assigned to Mikhail Yangel's Yuzhnoye Design Office (OKB-586) on 20 March 1958.

It was intended for the \"Golf\"-class submarines (Project 629B); the complete missile system was called the D-4 weapon complex.\n\nThe 4th Research Institute had been conducting trials of underwater missile launch systems since 1955 with modified Scuds but the first successful launch was in 1960 and the first flight of a standard R-21 was in 1962. Over the lifetime of the missile, 193 out of 228 launches were successful.\n\nThe R-21 was probably the basis for the design of the North Korean No Dong (Rodong-1) missile.\n\nUnlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch solid rocket to eject the missile from the flooded launch tube before the main motor ignited. This allowed missiles to be launched in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-Inhibited red fuming nitric acid-amine fuel, \"AK-27I/TG-02\". The AK-27I oxidizer was a mixture of 73% nitric acid, 27% nitrogen tetroxide, and an iodine inhibitory passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300 km, and extended to 1650 km later in the life of the missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons.\n\n\nThere was some confusion about the SS-N-4/5/6 series of missiles in the West, the SS-N-5 is normally given the NATO reporting name 'Sark' like the SS-N-4 first carried by the Golf submarines, but some variants were assigned the name 'Serb' normally used for the SS-N-6. Jane's uses 'Sark'.\n\nThe missiles replaced first-generation R-11FM and R-13 missiles on some Golf (Project 629) and Hotel (Project 658) class SSBNs, with three missiles per submarine, between 1963 and 1967. They were succeeded from 1967 by Yankee-class submarines carrying 2400 km-range R-27 (SS-N-6 'Serb') missiles. Seven of the eight Hotel I (Project 658) subs were upgraded to Hotel II (Project 658M) standard, which were retired by 1991.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Second Notice\" has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published. \n\nIn late 1992, the late Henry W. Kendall, a former chair of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) board of directors, wrote the first warning World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, which begins: \"Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course.\" A majority of the Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences signed the document; about 1,700 of the world's leading scientists appended their signature.\n\nIt was sometimes offered in opposition to the Heidelberg Appeal—also signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992—which begins by criticizing \"an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress, and impedes economic and social development.\" This document was often cited by those who oppose theories relating to climate change.\n\nHowever, the Heidelberg Appeal offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of environmental science: \"We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved. But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions.\"\n\nIn contrast, the UCS-led petition contains specific recommendations: \"We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water. ... We must stabilize population.\"\n\nIn November 2017, 15,364 scientists signed World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice written by lead author professor of ecology, William J.

The \"Second Notice\" included 9 time-series graphs of key indicators, each correlated to a specific issue mentioned in the original 1992 warning, to show that most environmental issues are continuing to trend in the wrong direction, most with no discernible change in rate. The article included 13 specific steps humanity could take to transition to sustainability.\n\nThe \"Second Notice\" has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published.

He specializes in painting, stone lithography and sculpture.\n\nParkes studied graphic art and painting at the University of Kansas. As a student, Parkes was fascinated by various graphic processes, and he later became proficient in the difficult medium of the colour stone lithograph. Many of his recent works have been produced as Aurographics, limited edition giclée prints.\n\nHis unique style evolved in isolation, after a period in which he gave up the practice of art altogether and went to India in search of philosophical illumination, a location that he and his wife continue to visit annually.\n\nEarly on, he painted in the generally abstract expressionist style common among his teachers. However, he later began to draw and paint in a meticulous style of detailed representation. This style is realistic in principle, but often uses magical subject matter, with imagery drawn from a range of traditions including the cabalistic and the tantric. Strange beasts encounter mysterious winged women, good and evil fight out their eternal conflict.\n\nSeveral of Parkes' works have been used as cover illustrations, including:\n\nA Parkes sculpture, \"Angel Affair\" (2004), was the Sep/Oct 2004 cover illustration for the Dutch-language \"Fine Arts Magazine\", which also contained a feature article on one of Parkes' exhibitions in the Netherlands.\n\nLisa Starry of Scorpius Dance Theater, Phoenix Arizona in 2007 choreographed a contemporary dance presentation based on the works of Parkes. Also in 2007, Parkes was invited to exhibit a painting of his own vision of Venus at an international exhibition of 35 magic realism artists in Denmark.\n\nIn 2009, one of Parkes' paintings, \"The Three Graces\", is repeatedly mentioned in Dan Brown's novel \"The Lost Symbol\". Parkes was interviewed for his interpretation of the symbolic use of his art in Brown's book by Daniel Burstein.

Established in 1935, it was the first private university and medical school in Mexico. The university was the result of the struggle against the communist and socialist laws and influence in the higher education of Mexico. It was first conceived with the name Universidad del Occidente (\"University of the West\"), but would later be styled to Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara (UAG).\n\nEstablished University in the Community (UNICO) was the first community college in Mexico. It also operates an elementary school, two middle schools, and three high schools and postgraduate studies. The university has become one of the most important educational institutions in Latin America, attracting students from 25 different countries.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) which had recently ended was assisted by agents of the Comintern organization (1919–1943) which had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (1922–1991), even though after the fall of the Soviet Union and the organization officially suspended, they had laid the foundation for Marxism-Leninism. They were looking to replace the free and secular education established in the Constitution of 1917 in Mexico, therefore seeking to make socialist education become obligatory in all levels of education in the country. Articles 3 and 24 of the Constitution enshrine respectively secular education and freedom of belief. Subsequent president General Álvaro Obregón Salido continued and the subsequent Maximato, preaching the class struggle, the abolition of private property and socialist education in official circles.\n\nJosé Vasconcelos Calderón (1882–1959) had insisted as Secretary of Education and dean of the Universidad Nacional supported by the most distinguished thinkers of the time, for a free and secular educational system, but his political defeat in 1929 was part of the removal of obstacles for the advancement of the anti-national thinking, communism and socialism. In that same year President Emilio Cándido Portes Gil (1928–1930) granted autonomy to the Universidad Nacional becoming Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico under pressure from the National Confederation of Students and others.\n\nIn 1932 and 1933 there were meetings of National Education, as the Board of Inspectors and Directors of Federal Education, the Pedagogical Congress, the Convention of the Mexican Confederation of Teachers, the National Pro-Cardenas Convention, the Congress of the Confederation of Political Parties, Veracruz Socialists, the X Congress of the National Confederation of Students and others, whose conclusions stated that:\n\"The State must completely take over the children of workers and peasants, both economically and educationally...\" that \"the time has come, young students, for fully implementing socialism\" (translated) - Garcia Tellez representing Lazaro Cardenas (president of Mexico).\n\nStudents from various parts of the country, especially in the state of Jalisco, opposed this teaching socialism in the university. Foremost among them was Antonio Caso, who argued under the banner of \"academic freedom\" that this freedom was essential to academic life and to the advancement of science and national leadership as stipulated in the Constitution of 1917. National newspapers published the event at the time on front pages; on September 15, 1933 with headlines \"Will be? socialist orientation of the National University\" (\"El Nacional\"), \"Climate for Marxism at the University\" (Excélsior), while the \"Universal\" in its editorial transcribed words if \"The university should not be sectarian ... Lombardo's paper is directly contrary to the spirit and letter of Article 3. of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe maximum leader of the revolution, Plutarco Elias Calles, warned that despite the fuss caused by state-controlled organizations in preparation for the implementation of Marxist teaching, the bulk of the civil society refused, saying it was just a bridge to the establishment of communism in Mexico, so he decided to personally intervene in one of the most critical areas of confrontation: Guadalajara, where the propellers of university autonomy and freedom of education had controlled the student federation. On July 20, 1934 he spoke to the people of Jalisco specifically on the reform of Article 3 of the Constitution, him being a former president, his message was known as the \"Grito de Guadalajara\", he appointed his own successor as president Lázaro Cárdenas del Río. After such serious allegations it reaffirmed the conviction of the libertarian side, yet accelerated the progress of the reform and the 23rd Legislative Commission, headed by Alberto Bremauntz and Alberto Coria, delivered to congress his proposed constitutional amendment, by publishing in the press two days later. The reform of article 3 of the Constitution, during the last year of the presidency of General Abelardo Rodriguez, the issue of socialist education went from college to all social areas, since December 1933. Deputies and senators declare that the reform by the National Revolutionary Party (NRP) through the Institute of Economic Studies would begin in June, the NRP itself was preparing to develop intensive activities across the country to carry out the agreements of the Six Year Plan wherein the elementary and middle school education would be based on socialist doctrines. In its final version, was approved by the Senate on October 11, 1934.\n\nThe strike in October 1933 in Jalisco collided with two conflicting tendencies: the imposition of socialist education by the official side and the autonomy and academic freedom from civil society. The crisis began when the director Enrique Diaz de Leon intended to apply at the University of Guadalajara the conclusions of the Mexican congress on the university, which he started alongside Vicente Lombardo Toledano and agreed to implement the compulsory Marxist education in all of the country, although the constitution stipulated it as secular. The students and civil society of Guadalajara reacted against the provisions and laws that established the Marxist education from primary to university, from the dean Enrique Diaz de Leon co-chaired with Vicente Lombardo Toledano Congress of the Mexican university opened national controversy on the theme, producing the phenomenon of young students who led the start of the protest. There was in Guadalajara many professors for the reform as Case, Azuela, Gomez Morin, Chico Goerne or Brito Frouchier willing to open the controversial high level socialist education as in the National University, but there was a heightened state of young leaders led by Carlos Cuesta Gallardo, Angel Leano Alvarez del Castillo and Antonio Leano Alvarez del Castillo who tried to prevent the application of Article 3 in the former University of Guadalajara.\n\nThe striking students were aware that their rebellion did not face only the dean and his fans, but directly the Governor Sebastián Allende with his capacity for repression by the police and the army, the socialist leader Enrique Diaz de Leon did not inhibit them to extend the strike to all schools and start organizing rallies in squares and markets to inform the people the reasons for their attitude and their main demands which were academic freedom, instead of mandatory imposed socialist education, participation in the university council to co-govern college, university autonomy which removed the government of the university's administration while still meeting the economic budget and the immediate dismissal of Enrique Diaz de Leon as dean because of being sectarian and corrupt. Two days after the strike began, soldiers from 34 Regiments, commanded by General Manuel Limón, evicted students from the university and sent them to jail, totaled at more than 250. Twenty-eight days into the strike congress passed a law proposed by the governor, that decreed the closure of the university which automatically lifted the strike. The formed strike committee turned into a Claiming Student Rights pro Committee and submitted to the government a list of requests which stated, a free university from political interference or religious; moral and political autonomy, appointment of competent teachers, student participation in government and a large social program to benefit the children of workers and peasants who enroll, while reorganizing all schools and universities.\n\nNegotiations continued simultaneously with rallies of students and civil society that supported the release of the approximately 250 students arrested on October 25 and 26. Parents and peers had failed efforts locally and sent telegrams to the President Abelardo Rodriguez, who was also requested by the National Confederation of Students and sectors of the National University of Mexico, yet congress was not willing to lose the country's universities with grants similar to that granted to UNAM \"autonomy\". Having hostage 250 students in jails, the government agreed to reopen negotiations with the mediation University of the National Confederation of Students, reaching an agreements with just a hint of student proposals without imposing socialist education. On November 27 an agreement was signed, the release of prisoners was authorized. The opening of the University of Guadalajara on January 2, 1934 was announced.\n\nReopened the University was appointed a new dean Dr. Manuel R. Alatorre and on February 26, 1934 the new Organic Law was signed on the basis of the agreements in November 1933. Student representation served with delegates from different schools and colleges. The strengthening student action was increasing the need of a final union into a body to replace the former Federation of University Students of Jalisco perished with the old university, having perished its alliance with the former president. That was how on March 15, 1934 the delegates elected by the various societies of students gathered, except for the highschools and elected a board of directors chaired by Carlos Cuesta Gallardo, Angel Leano Alvarez del Casillo, Antonio Leano Alvarez del Casillo, Antonio Perez, Daniel Salazar Hurtado, Joaquin Aceves, Porfirio Barba and Francisco Lopez Gonzalez in positions of greater responsibility. This choice was a determining factor in the sequence of university and political actions of the following months leading to the creation of the 'Autonomous University of the West', later called Guadalajara. The FEJ was not the only student group in the Republic rejecting socialism in education. The same happened with the university in the capital, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Tampico, Zacatecas, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca etc., who were also fighting for the defense of their homes against the imposition of Marxist dogma, making this movement a national student conflict. The student unions publicly supported the parent's associations, labor and peasant organizations.\n\nIn January 1935 the Student Federation of Jalisco (FEJ) returned to the fray with new opposition, the newly created West Front of Socialist Students (FESO) organized by Jose Guadalupe Zuno and Ignacio Jacobo to give back and to reopen the university, and to comply with the mandate to implement Marxist philosophy to all higher education.\n\nEverardo Topete had assumed the governorship of the state, in his government program he confirmed that the \"university reorganization will respond to the spiritual movement in the country initiated the reform of article 3\". On February 27, 1935 new demonstrators approached the Government Palace of Guadalajara to protest against the requests asked by the governor, but on arrival the Government Palace was full of troops under the command of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, identified as the \"red shirts\", which dispersed the demonstrators with clubs and gun fire. The Student Federation of Jalisco (FEJ) issued a statement the next day saying, \"As the sole and authentic representative of the student class in Jalisco the FEJ strongly condemns the killing accomplished by politicians and policemen in the town, of the defenseless demonstrators which were unarmed, largely women, who orderly and peacefully marched through the streets of our city.\" In the following days the governor Topete accused the protesters of \"fanatics\" and \"provocative\" but moderated his attitude due to the messages of condemnation from around the country and abroad by the brutality with which he performed, including the presidency of the republic who became identified as an accomplice to the crime of the government.\n\nGovernor Topete decided to accept and ordered the Secretary of Government, to draft a law reform with these conditions and asked: Do you accept to make a university without the government ever giving any assets or any subsidy...? which they answered: We accept!. Nuñez building 28, was the first seat of the University, they started dividing the foundational tasks like renting houses for schools and colleges, set curricula, organizing the team of teachers and initiate enrollment, while incorporating studies of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).\n\nThe first dean of the Autonomous University of the West was the lawyer Agustin Navarro Flores, under whose leadership the first faculties were organized. On May 5, 1935 named Director of the School of Jurisprudence to Mr. Alberto G. Arce.; On May 15 were designated as Director and Secretary of the School of Medicine medical doctors Adolfo Esteban Saucedo and Cave Brambila; Dr. Agustin Hernandez was the first Director of Dentistry; the engineer Luis Ugarte was of Engineering and Professor Maria Villanueva assumed the leadership of the High School.\n\nOn April 21, 1956 the second dean of the UAG Dr. Fernando Banda, with the Lic. Manuel Calvillo, Director of Schools Incorporated, sent on behalf of Dr. Nabor Carrillo Flores, at that time Rector of the UNAM, the foundation stone of the University City, First Section, where there is now the Institute of Biological Sciences. From 1965 to 1973 the objectives of the first stage of the Master Plan were fully met. The Autonomous University City, whose construction had begun in 1968, was inaugurated on April 30, 1970, for the third dean Dr. Luis Garibay Gutierrez. In 1970 the Central Library building was completed, where technical processes are concentrated and simultaneously the School of Library. In 1972 the works of the Women's School educational complex were completed.\n\nRelations between the Autonomous University of Guadalajara and the federal and local governments were only difficult in its first decades. In 1991 due to the university's 56 years of existence, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari instructed the Secretary of Education to issue the 158th Agreement that grants the university full academic independence and her ability to cast their own titles in all levels of education, which is in effect since July 26 of that year when published in the Official Gazette.\nThe university sought and obtained support from other educational institutions in Mexico and in the international context, especially in Latin America and the United States. In the seventies and eighties, UAG expanded its network of cooperative agreements around the world, also playing a leading role in the founding and development of groups and international organizations such as the Latin American University Group for the Study and Improvement of Education (GULERPE) associations; Ajijic Center for the Improvement of Higher Education in America (CAMESA); the Instituo Ajijic on International Education (IASEI) and the Council. Inter University for Economic and Social Development (CUIDES). In 1987 the International Association of University Presidents (IAUP), elected as its President Dean of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara. UAG plays a leading role in the IAUP and in several international educational organizations.\n\nThe school runs a program called \"Strengthening Teachers\", whose purpose is the academic aspects of the institution. This program includes the participation of professors and experts from other countries who, through short visits, participate in training programs at UAG. Teachers from UAG also provide the opportunity to participate in such programs, with sister universities in other countries.\n\nThe Division of Continuing Education of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara is a specialized developmental training program. Founded in 1972 is the Training Center with diversity and a number of courses. It is divided into four institutes: INDHEX, INDTECNO, IDEA, ICASA. It has five centers for the development of the institutions: EMPRENDE, CEPEP, EDUMALL, educational mission, on the job training.\n\nIt is the oldest private medical school in Mexico. The first class was taught on June 5, 1935, the same year of the school's birthdate, its first residency quarters were located on Tolsa Avenue (current Enrique Diaz de Leon Avenue) in Guadalajara, in an area donated by Ramón Garibay which later became the university's hospital; Later the hospital was named Hospital Ramón Garibay in honor of its patron.\n\nIn 1963, the basic science courses of the Medical School were moved to Lomas del Valle campus that houses the Institute of Biological Sciences. The clinical courses were in the Hospital Ramon Garibay. Later, in 1974, the second university hospital opened; This hospital is named after one of the most prominent founders of the University, Dr. Angel Leano, it was designed with specific requirements for different types of learning, offering new facilities for students during their clinical semesters. Doctor Angel Leano university hospital and Ramón Garibay University Hospital began the internship program and specialty residencies since 1970 in pediatrics, gynecology, obstetrics, anesthesiology and pneumology. Medical School currently offers training in ophthalmology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, ENT, orthopedics and dermatology. There are master's programs in health services administration, morphological sciences, physiology and health.\n\nThe UAG Faculty of Medicine has over 15,000 graduates practicing medicine in all 50 states of the U.S.A, in over 15 countries. The school has affiliation agreements and partnerships with a number of hospitals; in Mexico there are agreements with over 100 hospitals, and with other countries.\n\nEducation program and community care started in 1955 as a project of multidisciplinary practices involving students and professors of medicine, architecture, dentistry, social work, psychology, nursing, law and chemistry for the purpose of helping poor communities. In 1973 it was formally established as the Medicine in the Community (PMC) program as part of a plan called Education in the Community, to support the actions of the Medical Brigade (WB) and the Mobile Hospital Disaster. In 1998 the Primary Care Mobile Unit (UMAP) was created which helped in the development of basic health within the concept of Medicine in the Community (PMC) program, the activities focused on community, education and welfare, allowing an adequate and varied exercise of medical education for the poor and sick.\n\nThe president of the United States of America George H. W. Bush, in the person of Lic. Antonio Leano Alvarez del Castillo, gave an award in 1990 to the UAG, which had graduated 7,500 American doctors as of that year. The Medicine in the Community (PMC) program received a special national award from the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox and his wife, Martha Sahagún, for service in the community at the National Volunteer Awards 2002.\n\nIs approved for listing in the World Health Organization, World Directory of medical schools, United States Department of Education approval (title IV), recognized and approved by the government of Mexico to confer the degree of Physician Surgeon, accredited by the Mexican Council for the Accreditation of Medical Education (COMAEM) the U.S. Department of Education has determined that COMAEM's (Mexican Council for the Accreditation of Medical Education) is comparable to the LCME process, Mexican republic senate recognition, The Institute for International Medical Education (IIME), Mexican Federal Secretary of Public Education (SEP),National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA), Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), Consejo para la Acreditación de la Educación Superior (COPAES), Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) and others.\n\nFrancisco L. Alvarado, M.D., M.S.; Assistant Director for the Illinois Department of Human Services' Division of Rehabilitation Services (DHS/DRS) State of Illinois. In 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton awarded Dr. Alvarado the State Department's for the U.S. - Mexico Foundation's Mexican American Leadership Initiative (MALI)award, recognizing the importance of working together in the spirit of shared responsibility of critical issues facing Mexico and the U.S. The Foundation was formed in 2010 for the purpose of fostering constructive responses and partnerships between the societies of the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nIn 1970 the School of Journalism was created and was later expanded to Communication Sciences. It began shortly to publish its own newspaper, \"Eight Columns\", written and published by students. The emergence of other newspapers, existing academic and student publications and expansion of the school, led to the creation of the Center of Communication University (CECUN) in 1977. In 1978 \"Eight Columns\" became a daily public distribution that reached the state of Jalisco and had an average of 48,000 copies and 80 pages per day.\n\nThe Communications and Development coordinates corporate communication to the media and publishing activities of the different schools and universities, teachers and student facilities.\nThe \"Nexus\" newspaper and the magazine \"Alma Mater\", dedicated to university graduates and their families, and the academic publication \"Teaching\", which is circulated in Latin America and is an instrument of international organizations such as GULERPE, CAMESA and IASEI, in the areas of health and news, are also published. The university press publishes several dozen titles a year intended for educational, cultural or research purposes, with internal circulation.\n\nUniversity in the Community (UNICO) is an institution of higher education that is part of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara since 1992, inspired by the community colleges in the United States. The key features of UNICO are short courses that correspond according to the regulatory legal framework of the Secretaria de Educacion Publica (SEP). Graduates who satisfactorily meet the established academic requirements obtain a Certificate of Study and a Title issued by the Autonomous University of Guadalajara, and a Professional Certificate issued by Secretaria de Educacion Publica (SEP) with official recognition and coverage for exercise throughout the country. UNICO has four campuses, two in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, the third in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco and the fourth in the city of Tecoman, Colima. UNICO has established institutional agreements of academic and student order, with various community colleges of Canada and the United States.\n\nTecos F.C. and other athletic programs play their home games at the Estadio Tres de Marzo which is located in Zapopan, Jalisco. It has a capacity of 30,015. The steel stands were prefabricated and had a capacity of around 3,000 people. By virtue of UAG ascending to the second level of Mexican football in 1973 and according to a ruling from the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación, new concrete stands were constructed on the sides of the pitch. This brought the stadium capacity to 15,000 people, the minimum forum for a second division stadium. In 1975, after the Tecos de la UAG ascended to the Primera División de Mexico, the stands were once again remodeled in order to meet the minimum demands of the division which was 25,000 people.\n\nThe stadium once again went through renovation in order to accommodate the 1986 World Cup which brought the capacity to 30,015 people after new standing room areas were created.\n\nIn 1999, Estadio Tres de Marzo underwent its last major renovation which included improvements such as a new pitch and drainage system. The stadium earned its name from the founding date of the Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara, on March 3, 1935.\n\nThe school's professional soccer team is named Tecos after the university symbol, the Tecolote, which is a word for \"owl\" in Spanish, and which is derived from the Nahuatl word for owl, \"tecolotl\".

The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described the effect. Binary interaction of smaller circulations can cause the development of a larger cyclone, or cause two cyclones to merge into one. Extratropical cyclones typically engage in binary interaction when within of one another, while tropical cyclones typically interact within of each other.\n\nWhen cyclones are in proximity of one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) about a point between the two systems due to their cyclonic wind circulations. The two vortices will be attracted to each other, and eventually spiral into the center point and merge. It has not been agreed upon whether this is due to the divergent portion of the wind or vorticity advection. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described it in a 1921 paper about the motion of vortices in water.\n\nTropical cyclones can form when smaller circulations within the Intertropical Convergence Zone merge. The effect is often mentioned in relation to the motion of tropical cyclones, although the final merging of the two storms is uncommon. The effect becomes noticeable when they approach within of each other. Rotation rates within binary pairs accelerate when tropical cyclones close within of each other. Merger of the two systems (or shearing out of one of the pair) becomes realized when they are within of one another.\n\nBinary interaction is seen between nearby extratropical cyclones when within of each other, with significant acceleration occurring when the low-pressure areas are within of one another. Interactions between their circulations at the 500 hPa level (18,000 feet above sea level) behave more predictably than their surface circulations. This most often results in a merging of the two low-pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone, or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of one or both of the cyclones. The precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones, their distance from each other, and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them.\n\n\n"}

In 1984 they won the Q104 Homegrown Vol. 1 contest; the first prize was the chance to record a single, but they took the opportunity to invest their own money and record a 5-song EP, which eventually sold over 5,000 copies in the Maritimes. In 1985 they won the Labatt's Battle of the Bands, and used the $10,000 first prize to record more material. While the band member lineup had been largely unaltered from the start, drummer Sean Kilbride was the fourth drummer in the group's short history. Ron \"Bumble\" LeBlanc had replaced the original Haywire drummer Scott Roberts in 1984. He remained with the band through their demo stages, EP, and can be heard playing on two cuts of the band's first record with Attic. LeBlanc was replaced by Mac Cole when he decided to move on from the group and pursue a formal education. Cole only played two months with the band, when Haywire's long-time friend Kilbride became available for the job. In the summer of 1986 the group signed up Kilbride and successfully pursued a record contract with Attic.\n\nTheir first full-length album, \"Bad Boys\", went platinum in Canada, while the title track became a Top 40 hit. The following year, they released \"Don't Just Stand There\", which also went platinum and contained their highest charting hit, the hard-driving \"Dance Desire\". A promised third video was not forthcoming from the label, so Haywire financed the video for \"Fire\" themselves. Although this showed great initiative and conviction by the group, this inexplicably did not please Attic. Throughout the late 1980s, Haywire toured with other popular Canadian rockers such as Helix, Honeymoon Suite and Kim Mitchell. They also represented Canada in the World Popular Song Festival in Japan, where \"Dance Desire\" won the award for best song. Despite their success in Canada, and interest Stateside from Doc McGee (Management for Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Skid Row), Q-Prime, and Chrysalis Records, they were unable to secure a US recording contract due to unrealistic demands from their record company.\n\nThe follow-up album, \"Nuthouse\", was recorded in Norway with Bjorn Nessjo at the production helm; one of Europe's most sought-after producers at the time. Unsatisfied with the final mix of the album, Haywire flew back to Canada and remixed it themselves. The final result was guitar-driven, had a much harder edge and was the direction the band had always wanted to pursue, rather than the soft-rock/pop-rock pap their record label thought was necessary. The videos for the first two singles, \"Short End of a Wishbone\" & \"Operator Central\" were the most expensive Canadian videos produced that year. Although it hit platinum sales it was a major change in musical direction and as a result, alienated some of the younger fans they attracted with their first two offerings...while it did garner major AOR radioplay and was well-received, the record company wasn't willing to nurture & develop the new direction and following, and as a result Attic shelved the album without a third video as promised - again. They produced one more album, 1992's \"Get Off\", which was critically well-received, but still did not fuel the support from the record company (financial and otherwise) that they needed. Haywire compromised, and had the first two videos made for the price of one with the label promising a third for the single \"Buzz\". Once again, Attic did not deliver. This was quite short-sighted as the single reached No. 13 without video support (their highest chart ranking, second only to \"Dance Desire\"). After contractual struggles, the group refused to re-sign with their label Attic. To fulfill their contractual obligations with Haywire, Attic released a greatest hits CD in 1993 entitled \"\" without the band's input.\n\nThe band has had their albums re-issued on CD through Unidisc Music. In November 2006, Haywire were awarded the Music Prince Edward Island Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn 2011, Haywire were presented with the Dr. Helen Creighton 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from the East Coast Music Association (ECMA)\n\nHaywire continues to work on a new album and plan a release in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in December 2004 under academic leadership of the Fiji Institute of Applied Studies and financial sponsorship of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji, a Hindu religious organization dedicated to education.\" On 14 February 2016, the Native Lands Trust Board (NLTB) signed a 99-year lease with the university for the 5-hectare property, for which the university paid F$100,000. The university agreed in return to provide two scholarships annually for the children of landowners.\n\nThe University of Fiji honoured its first graduates in March 2017. Fiji's President Ratu Josefa Iloilovatu, who is also the University's Chancellor, spoke at the graduation ceremony, and commended the university for making it compulsory for all students to follow basic courses in Fijian and Hindi: “Our future depends on our ability and desire to understand each other better, to communicate with each other better, and to assist each other. Being able to communicate in each other’s language is vital for this.” Fijian is the language of the country's majority ethnic group, while Hindi is the main language of the largest ethnic minority.\n\nThe university offers courses up to postgraduate level in the following fields: Accounting, Economics, Management, Computing Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Language and Literature, Fijian Language and Culture, Medicine, Law, and Hindi Language and Culture.\n\nIt includes six \"Centres of Excellence\", namely a Centre for Indigenous Studies (CIS), a Centre for International and Regional Affairs (CIRA), the Gandhi-Tappoo Centre for Writing, Ethics and Peace Studies (WEPS), a Centre for Diasporic Studies (CDS), a Centre for Gender Research (CGR), and a Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development.\n\nThe university is governed by the University of Fiji Council.

Vice-Chancellor Rajesh Chandra said on 26 May 2005 that the agreement would effectively link the University of Fiji with international academic networks and would help ensure the quality of instruction.\n\nThe \"Fiji Times\" quoted Professor Chandra on 16 February 2006 as saying that making higher education available to underprivileged communities would lead to equitable development, which would foster social and political stability in the long run.\n\nProfessor Chandra announced plans on 6 March to establish a medical school, and said that if donors could be found, the university would set up another campus in the northern island of Vanua Levu. The medical school, to be called the Dr Umanand Prasad School of Medicine, is the brainchild of Dr. Umanand Prasad, a native of Labasa who has invested F$1 million for a medical school in his home country, after thirty years abroad.

It is a cyclic secondary amine, also classified as a saturated heterocycle. It is a colourless liquid that is miscible with water and most organic solvents. It has a characteristic odor that has been described as \"ammoniacal, fishy, shellfish-like\". In addition to pyrrolidine itself, many substituted pyrrolidines are known.\n\nPyrrolidine is prepared industrially by the reaction of 1,4-Butanediol and ammonia at a temperature of 165–200 °C and a pressure of 17–21 MPa in the presence of a cobalt- and nickel oxide catalyst, which is supported on alumina.\n\nThe reaction is carried out in the liquid phase in a continuous tube- or tube bundle reactor, which is operated in the cycle gas method. The catalyst is arranged as a fixed-bed and the conversion is carried out in the downflow mode. The product is obtained after multistage purification and separation by extractive and azeotropic distillation.\n\nIn the laboratory, pyrrolidine was usually synthesised by treating 4-chlorobutan-1-amine with a strong base:\n\nMany modifications of pyrrolidine are found in natural and synthetic chemistry. The pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural alkaloids such as nicotine and hygrine. It is found in many drugs such as procyclidine and bepridil. It also forms the basis for the racetam compounds (\"e.g.\" piracetam, aniracetam). The amino acids proline and hydroxyproline are, in a structural sense, derivatives of pyrrolidine.\n\nPyrrolidine is a base. Its basicity is typical of other dialkyl amines. Relative to many secondary amines, pyrrolidine is distinctive because of its compactness, a consequence of its cyclic structure.\n\nPyrrolidine is used as a building block in the synthesis of more complex organic compounds. It is used to activate ketones and aldehydes toward nucleophilic addition by formation of enamines (e.g. used in the Stork enamine alkylation):\n"}

{"id": "2016839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016839", "title": "Hội An", "text": "Hội An\n\nHội An (), formerly known as Fai-Fo or Faifoo, is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam's Quảng Nam Province and noted since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nOld Town Hội An, the city's historic district, is recognized as an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. Prominent in the city's old town, is its , dating to the 16th-17th century.\n\nHội An (會安) translates as \"peaceful meeting place\". In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as \"Faifo\". This word is derived from Vietnamese \"Hội An phố\" (the town of Hội An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\".\n\nBetween the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu Bồn River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called \"Hai Pho\" (Seaside Town, 海庯) in Vietnamese.\n\nOriginally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Chùa cầu) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side. \n\nThe early history of Hội An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Huế to beyond Nha Trang. Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented. In the early years, Mỹ Sơn was the spiritual capital, Trà Kiệu was the political capital and Hội An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands.\n\nIn 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain António de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. Hội An was founded as a trading port by the Nguyễn Lord Nguyễn Hoàng sometime around 1595. The Nguyễn lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Trịnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, Hội An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to Hội An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship.\nThe early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at Hội An.\n\nIn the 18th century, Hội An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from Hội An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.\nHội An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguyễn rule (thanks to the Tây Sơn Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of Đà Nẵng. Đà Nẵng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while Hội An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that Hội An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that Hội An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back Hội An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.\n\nToday, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in Hội An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism. \n\nHoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 °C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 °C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 °C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid.\nCalm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South. The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore Cù lao Chàm islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism.\n\nIn 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on Hội An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation.\n\nOwing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after António de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.\n\nThis longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make \"cao lầu\" or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city.\n\nThe Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late-fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered.\n\nAnother attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune.\n\nThe Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.\n\nThe city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket.\n\nThe Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times.\n\nThe Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents.\n\nThe Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of Hội An as a major trading port in South East Asia.\n\nThe Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Huỳnh culture—considered to be the original settlers on the Hội An site—dating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Huỳnh artefacts in Vietnam.\n\nThe Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by Réhahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam.\nAccording to CNN, Hoi An is the \"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, pâté, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. Famous chef, Anthony Bourdain, visited a particular sandwich shop in Hội An, called Banh Mi Phuong, during the making of his food travel TV show ''. In the show he declared their Banh Mi to be the best sandwich he had ever eaten. Consequently, ever since the show was broadcast, Banh Mi Phuong has become famous. Long lines of tourists and locals can be found queueing to buy their Banh Mi on a daily basis.\n\nThe regional dish is Cao lầu, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams.\n\nOther regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), bánh xèo, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.\n\n\n"}

The spark for her activism was an experience at a newborn nursery, where she had been instructed to attend a circumcision of an infant boy. In 1985, when she was working as a nurse on an obstetrical service, Milos was forced to resign by the hospital administration for discussing circumcision with patients. In the same year, she founded NOCIRC.\n\nMilos, who opposes non-therapeutic circumcision of children, bases part of her argument on the fact that the foreskin protects the glans from friction and abrasion throughout life. She also believes that circumcision of infants should be seen as a human rights issue:\n\"Only by denying the existence of excruciating pain, perinatal encoding of the brain with violence, interruption of maternal-infant bonding, betrayal of infant trust, the risks and effects of permanently altering normal genitalia, the right of human beings to sexually intact and functional bodies, and the right to individual religious freedoms can human beings continue this practice.\"\nIn 1990, Milos was honored by the California Nurses Association for her \"unwavering commitment to righting a wrong.\" She received \"NurseWeek\" magazine's Nursing Excellence 2001 Patient Advocacy Award.\n\nAccording to Michael and David Benatar, \"[Milos's] argument begs the question.

The protest, which is often a silent, non-violent means of expressing disapproval, is often interpreted as an exercise of the freedom of association while allowing the speaker to exercise the freedom of speech, albeit with a reduced audience in attendance.\n\nThese were a series of 1968 protests against unequal conditions in Los Angeles Unified School District high schools, beginning on March 6.\n\nIn the beginning of the 19th century there was a change in economic circumstances with the booming Industrial Revolution and young single women, between ages of fourteen to early twenties felt the need to work to relieve financial pressures from their family and to gain a sense of independence of living on their own. They left home and began a new life in the mill boarding houses. While working in the mills they would send some monthly earnings back home to still fulfill the role as a contributing part of the family. However, the majority of their earnings was saved in the bank for their own desires. Most women who made this change came from a modest farming backgrounds and made the move to areas of New England and Mid Atlantic States.\n\nIn the early months of 1834, textile sales were slow and profits were not up to standard to provide sufficient wages for the women mill workers of Lowell, Massachusetts. As a result, wages were cut and the price of room and board went up. The mill factory women saw this wage cut and price increase as an offense to their dignity, social quality, and economic autonomy. The women decided to take action and many started petitions and held meetings during dinner breaks. They pledged that they would quit if the wage rates decreased. On a Friday in February 1834, a sporadic walkout began after a meeting in which an agent of a mill company dismissed a woman factory worker. Protesting began and the women quit work and started parading through the city streets, attempting to persuade other mill women to join. This walkout was short lived and by the middle of the next week the women either returned to work or left town. Only about one-sixth of all women workers in Lowell walked out.\n\nIn October 1836, the women workers in the Lowell, Massachusetts factory mills walked out once again for the same reasons as the strike in 1834. The young women saw the wage-cut and the increasing prices of housing board as a direct assault on their social and economic independence, and they wouldn't let the revolting wage-cut and rising prices undermined their status as \"daughters of freemen\". Furthermore, as influenced by their traditional values, the young women did not accept to be treated as slaves so they protested. In this second walkout however, the women workers were more organized, and the number of workers involved in the strikes were far numerous than the one sixth of all the factory workers in 1834 and this had a greater impact on the success of their operation. The other cause to their success of this second walkout was the economic prosperity of the 1840s; the mills profits were booming and they needed more workers. Therefore, the walkout of 1836 affected the mills greatly because they were short in workers, and the lengthy absence of the women accentuated the impact. As a result, some of the mills were obliged to cut their charges on housing, and they were forced to cooperate with the women workers' organization.\n\nThe women wanted to take a stand for their independence. With the decision making of having walkouts, they portrayed how women started a new revolution with a new idea of feminine autonomy and power. The 1834 and 1836 walkouts symbolized women standing against oppression by employers who wished to lower their wages, as well as increase the price in housing. With these walkouts women took a stand for themselves as well as paved the way for the generations of women to come.\n\n"}
{"id": "2016861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016861", "title": "California State Route 4", "text": "California State Route 4\n\nState Route 4 (SR 4) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, routed from Interstate 80 in the San Francisco Bay Area to State Route 89 in the Sierra Nevada. It roughly parallels the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a popular area for boating and fishing, with a number of accesses to marinas and other attractions. After crossing the Central Valley, the highway ascends up the Sierra foothills. It passes through Ebbetts Pass and contains the Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway.\n\nSR 4, an east–west highway, begins in Hercules at San Pablo Avenue next to the Interstate 80 junction as part of John Muir Parkway. (The actual parkway extends a bit past the western terminus.) The road is an expressway from its starting point until it approaches Martinez, at which point it becomes a full freeway (the California Delta Highway) passing Concord, Pittsburg, and Antioch. The John Muir National Historic Site is located directly north of Route 4 on Alhambra Avenue in Martinez. Alhambra Avenue at SR 4 is also the site of the Franklin Canyon Adobe. Two gauges of BART tracks run in the median of the freeway from the Port Chicago Highway interchange in Concord to just east of the Hillcrest Avenue interchange in Antioch, where the light rail line currently ends at the Antioch station. After Antioch, the freeway turns southward at its intersection with State Route 160, turning into a suburban and rural road bypassing the Bay Area's rapidly growing and outermost eastern suburbs (Oakley, Brentwood and Discovery Bay, California); and continues east across Victoria Island. This section is also known as the John Marsh Heritage Highway.\n\nRoute 4 east continues to Stockton, where it briefly joins I-5 and then enters a separate freeway (known locally as the Crosstown Freeway) routing almost directly through downtown Stockton. The route then runs concurrent with State Route 99 before running eastward into the Sierra through Angels Camp, one of the richest quartz mining sections of the Mother Lode and home of \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\", and Calaveras Big Trees State Park. The route runs through the . Pacific Grade Summit on its way up to the Ebbetts Pass and ends at State Route 89 ten miles (16 km) west of Topaz Lake, on the California–Nevada border. Signage indicating that CA 4 continues up to Woodfords exists in Woodfords heading Westbound, including reassurance shields for both CA 89 and CA 4 on top of the mileage sign just south of town. Eastbound signage for CA 4 stops at the intersection with CA 89. The portion from Arnold to its terminus is designated the Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway, which is eventually one lane.\n\nThrough the mountains, SR 4 is not suitable for large trucks, buses, or RVs, as it becomes very steep and eventually single-track, with no center dividing line shortly after the Mount Reba Turnoff to Bear Valley Ski area, with tight switchbacks. The pass is not plowed for snow, and thus closes during the winter months, often from November through as late as May. Thus, no passage between the Mount Reba Turnoff and Markleeville is possible. The western slope is plowed and rarely closes, even for a few hours, but often has chain restrictions during and immediately following storms, usually just east of Arnold. The eastern slope is not plowed.\n\nSR 4 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and from just west of Stockton to SR 49 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 4 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans from a point east of Arnold to SR 89, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 4 is also known as part of the John Muir Parkway from I-80 in Hercules to I-680 near Martinez, named for the environmentalist John Muir. The stretch through Franklin Canyon was once known as \"Blood Alley\".\n\nAlthough segments of Route 4 had been part of the state highway system since 1909, Route 4 was officially designated as such between US Route 40 (now Interstate 80) and State Route 99 in 1934. Prior to that date, the then-existing segment was officially known as the \"Borden Highway\", and the bridge over the San Joaquin River is still referred to as the \"Borden Highway Bridge\" in tidal tables. Construction of Route 4 did not finish until 1935, however.\n\nThe portion of Route 4 from US Route 40 to State Route 24 was added to the highway system in 1933 as Legislative Route Number (LRN) 106. East of the concurrency with State Route 24 to State Route 49, Route 4 was designated as LRN 75 from 1931-1934. Finally, the segment from State Route 49 to State Route 89 was signed as LRN 24 from 1909 to 1934.\n\nIn the 1970s, a significant portion of the Filipino American community of \"Little Manila\" in Stockton was demolished when the \"Crosstown Freeway\" was constructed, displacing what was once the largest population of Filipinos outside of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2009, a road built by the State Route 4 Bypass Authority, named the State Route 4 Bypass, opened in three phases, bypassing Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the south and west. Many of the signs and local maps designated this extension as simply \"Bypass Road\". A section of Marsh Creek Road was widened to serve as the connection between the bypass built by the authority and the original Route 4 towards Stockton. In 2012, Caltrans handed over authority for State Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the respective cities. In return, it gained control of the bypass and the upgraded section of Marsh Creek Road, which officially became State Route 4. \n\nConstruction is currently underway on widening the freeway section of Route 4 through Antioch, Oakley and Brentwood, with the final configuration as three mixed use lanes and one High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction and auxiliary lanes between interchanges as far as the interchange with Route 160. The median accommodates the eBART extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. All work at the Loveridge Road and Somersville Road/Auto Center Drive interchanges has been completed; however, the HOV lane east of the Loveridge Road overpass remains closed pending completion of construction at the L Street/Contra Loma Boulevard and A Street/Lone Tree Way interchanges. Speed on the freeway through the Antioch portion of Route 4 is limited to 55 miles per hour (90 km/h), as there is severe congestion, as well as areas where no shoulder exists due to temporary concrete barriers in place.\n\nOnly the portion of the bypass from California SR 160 to the Sand Creek Road interchange is a multi-lane freeway. The portion from Sand Creek Road to Vasco Road is single-lane each way and has signal-controlled grade crossings at Balfour Road and Marsh Creek Road. In May 2010, this narrow stretch of the road handled 27,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day. In 2011, Caltrans awarded $25 million toward upgrading the section from Lone Tree Way to Sand Creek Road to a full freeway and constructing an interchange at Sand Creek Road.\n\nSoon after the Sand Creek Interchange was opened in Brentwood in 2015, construction began on widening SR 4 to Balfour Road, the next major interchange planned for Brentwood. In 2017, work commenced on the Balfour Interchange, which will provide a 2-lane overpass for SR 4 and widen it a short distance beyond the Balfour exit.\n\nEffective in early March 2016, reconfiguration of the intersection of SR 4 and SR 160 was officially opened, allowing westbound SR 4 traffic to access northbound SR 160 directly and southbound SR 160 to access eastbound SR 4.\n\nThe freeway segment of SR 4 in Stockton is part of a proposed route to upgrade SR 99 into I-7 or I-9. Under one proposal, the new interstate would go along SR 99 from the split with I-5 at Wheeler Ridge north through Fresno to Stockton, where the proposed route would then turn west via the SR 4 freeway to a terminus at I-5.\n\nIn 2016, Pittsburg moved to install surveillance cameras along their portion of the route, in response to a series of 20 freeway shootings in the area that had taken the lives of six people, and injured 11, in the past year.\n\nThis table reflects the transfer of the State Route 4 Bypass to Caltrans in 2012. \n\nState Route 4 Business is a locally maintained business loop within the city of Angels Camp, California. It was established in August 2013 to attract customers to businesses along the parent route's former alignment, prior to the completion of the Angels Camp Bypass. It runs along South Main Street (co-signed with State Route 49), between State Route 4 and Vallecito Road, then turns east along Vallecito Road.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, the \"Brentwood Press\" newspaper reported that officials representing the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had held a groundbreaking ceremony to start a project that is intended to reduce congestion at the SR-4/I-680 interchange just outside Martinez. The multiphase project will widen SR-4 by adding a third lane in each direction, beginning at Morello Avenue in Martinez and ending at the merge of SR-4 and SR-242. It will also include replacing the 50-year-old Grayson Creek Bridge, which has outlived its serviceable life and does not meet current bridge safety codes. The project will impact about of SR-4. Although no schedule or end date has been announced, the officials said that the estimated cost is about $136 million (in 2018 dollars).\n\n"}

The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Ry.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (\"Municipality Reform\") that merged a number of existing parishes:\n\nRy municipality ceased to exist as the result of \"Kommunalreformen\" (\"The Municipality Reform\" of 2007). It was merged with Galten, Hørning, and Skanderborg municipalities to form the new Skanderborg municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 416 km and a total population of 49,469 (2005).\n\nRy, also known as Ry Station, is located between the lakes of Gudensø, Juulsø and Knudsø along the Guden River (\"Gudenå\"). It is a relatively new town that developed around the railroad tracks. The original town in the area is now known as Old Rye (\"Gammel Rye\").\n\nOld Rye is located 3 km west of Rye. During the Middle Ages it was one of the most important towns in the area. It had the royal status and privileges of being a merchant town, and is thus named in 1536. Starting in the 15th century until 1687, Old Rye was an area Court of Justice.\n\nThe town had a major impact on Danish history in 1534, when King Christian III was chosen there. Denmark was attacked by Lübeck when Frederik I died in 1533. This led to the three-year civil war fought between 1534-1536 called The Count's Feud (\"Grevens fejde\"), which ushered in the Danish Reformation.\n\nThe town's location at the crossroads for traffic between East Jutland and West Jutland, along with the royal glass production facility in nearby Glarbo until ca. 1600, have helped secure the town's position in the years after the Reformation. There is mention in 1553 of a royal coach maker in the area, and there used to be a royal hunting lodge in the area, but it was torn down in 1617. The town has suffered fire several times, f. ex. 1613, 1618 and 1660.\n\nSt. Søren's Church in Old Rye is at the site of a holy spring, and has had the reputation for bringing about miracles. In the Middle Ages many pilgrimages were made here. It is here that King Christian III was chosen in 1534. From 1579 a market was held on the site on the saint's day. According to legend, St. Søren was a local farmer who became a bishop in Cologne.\n\nIn the 19th century Old Rye became a center for the production of wooden shoes, and today there is a Wooden Shoe Museum located at the site of a historic windmill (1872) in the town.\n\nWith the establishment of the railroad from Skanderborg to Silkeborg in 1871, the area's growth, however, became centered on the station town Ry.\n\nLåsby can trace its origin to Viking times.\n\n\"Himmelbjerget\" (affectionately translated as \"Heaven Mountain\"), located in the former municipality, is one of the highest points of elevation in Denmark at 147 meters. The high hill is a popular destination for its beautiful nature and magnificent views. One can sail to \"Himmelbjerget\" from Ry, or from Silkeborg on the historic steamship \"Hjejlen\" (\"The Golden Plover\").\n\nOn top of the hill is a 25 meter tall tower that was erected to honor King Frederik VII and his role in giving the Danish people a constitution in 1849. Close to the top are more monuments, most honoring individuals, but also one to commemorate women's right to vote in 1915.\n\nThe Hotel Himmelbjerget, formerly Hotel Julsø, is the highest located hotel in Denmark, and displays historic memorabilia from the area. It used to house a museum dedicated to Jodle Birge, Danish country-western entertainer.\n\nTo the east of Old Rye is a ca. 23 hectares conservation area of heather-covered hills and oak scrub.

The organization suggests that circumcision be performed only when it is absolutely medically necessary and after alternative non-invasive therapies have failed, or when an adult gives consent, after he has been fully informed about the risks and harm of the procedure. NOCIRC also provides material on their view of circumcision and care of the foreskin. NOCIRC states that their position is based on the understanding that there is not a national or international health association in the world that recommends routine infant circumcision, yet declare that they hold the medical community accountable for \"misconstruing the scientific database available on human circumcision in the world today\". In a 1996 press release, NOCIRC stated that \"We expect this professional organization [the American Academy of Pediatrics] that is concerned with the health of infants and children to reveal the harm of genital cutting and to protect every child's birthright to keep his or her sex organs intact.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics said in 1999 that the perceived benefits of circumcision are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision, but that it should be the decision of informed parents.\n\nNOCIRC publishes a number of brochures for parents, providing their recommendations about infant circumcisions, penile care and several related topics. NOCIRC also distributes an annual newsletter to its members. Most of the organization's material is directly available on their website.\n\nSince 1989, NOCIRC has sponsored and organized international symposia on circumcision, human rights, and genital integrity.

When these gods mate with humans, offspring can be produced, and these children sometimes grow up to be shapeshifters; those who don't transform may instead have other powers. In reference to werecats who turn into lions, the ability is often associated with royalty. Such a being may have been a king or queen in a former life.\n\nIn Africa, there are folk tales that speak of the \"Nunda,\" or the \"Mngwa,\" a big cat of immense size that stalks villages at night. Many of these tales say it is more ferocious than a Lion and more agile than a Leopard. The Nunda are believed by some to be a variation of therianthrope that, by day, is a human, but by night becomes the werecat. No actual evidence of such a creature existing has ever been documented, but in 1938 a British Explorer named William Hichens, working in Tanzania, was told by locals that a monstrous cat had been attacking people at night. Huge paw prints were found to be much larger than any known big-cat, but Hichens dismissed the case, believing it more likely to be a lion with gigantism.\n\nMainland Asian werecats usually become tigers. In India, the weretiger is often a dangerous sorcerer, portrayed as a menace to livestock, who might at any time turn to man-eating. These tales travelled through the rest of India and into Persia through travellers who encountered the royal Bengal tigers of India and then further west. Chinese legends often describe weretigers as the victims of either a hereditary curse or a vindictive ghost. Ancient teachings held that every race except the Han Chinese were really animals in disguise, so that there was nothing extraordinary about some of these false humans reverting to their true natures. Alternatively, the ghosts of people who had been killed by tigers could become a malevolent supernatural being known as \"Chang\" (伥), devoting all their energy to making sure that tigers killed more humans. Some of these ghosts were responsible for transforming ordinary humans into man-eating weretigers. Also, in Japanese folklore there are creatures called bakeneko that are similar to kitsune (fox spirits) and bake-danuki (Japanese raccoon dog spirits). In Thailand a tiger that eats many humans may become a weretiger. There are also other types of weretigers, such as sorcerers with great powers who can change their form to become animals.\n\nIn both Indonesia and Malaysia there is another kind of weretiger, known as Harimau jadian. In Malaysia, Bajangs have been described as vampiric or demonic werecats. In the central area of the Indonesian island of Java the power of transformation is regarded as due to inheritance, to the use of spells, to fasting and willpower, to the use of charms, etc. Save when it is hungry or has just cause for revenge it is not hostile to man; in fact, it is said to take its animal form only at night and to guard the plantations from wild pigs. Variants of this belief assert that the shapeshifter does not recognize his friends unless they call him by name, or that he goes out as a mendicant and transforms himself to take vengeance on those who refuse him alms. Somewhat similar is the belief of the Khonds; for them the tiger is friendly, and he reserves his wrath for their enemies. A man is said to take the form of a tiger in order to wreak a just vengeance.\n\nThe foremost were-animal in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures was the were-jaguar. It was associated with the veneration of the jaguar, with priests and shamans among the various peoples who followed this tradition wearing the skins of jaguars to \"become\" a were-jaguar. Among the Aztecs, an entire class of specialized warriors who dressed in the jaguar skins were called \"jaguar warriors\" or \"jaguar knights\". Depictions of the jaguar and the were-jaguar are among the most common motifs among the artifacts of the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. \n\nN.W. Thomas wrote in the 11th ed. of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" (1911) that according to Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868), the \"kanaima\" was a human being who employed poison to carry out his function of blood avenger, and that other authorities represent the \"kanaima\" as a jaguar, which was either an avenger of blood or the familiar of a cannibalistic sorcerer. He also mentioned that in 1911 some Europeans in Brazil believed that the seventh child of the same sex in unbroken succession becomes a were-man or woman, and takes the form of a horse, goat, jaguar or pig.\n\nIn the US, urban legends tell of encounters with feline bipeds; beings similar to the Bigfoot having cat heads, tails, and paws. Feline bipeds are sometimes classified as part of cryptozoology, but more often they are interpreted as werecats.\n\nAssertions that werecats truly exist and have an origin in supernatural or religious realities have been common for centuries, with these beliefs often being hard to entirely separate from folklore. In the 19th century, occultist J. C. Street asserted that material cat and dog transformations could be produced by manipulating the \"ethereal fluid\" that human bodies are supposedly floating in. The Catholic witch-hunting manual, the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", asserted that witches can turn into cats, but that their transformations are illusions created by demons. New Age author John Perkins asserted that every person has the ability to shapeshift into \"jaguars, bushes, or any other form\" by using mental power. Occultist Rosalyn Greene claims that werecats called \"cat shifters\" exist as part of a \"shifter subculture\" or underground New Age religion based on lycanthropy and related beliefs.\n\nWerecats are increasingly featured in popular culture, although not as often as werewolves.\n\nBy far the most prevalent occurrence of werecats in pop culture is in books. Some novels, novellas, and short stories with werecats are listed below.\n\n\nWerecats also serve as heroes and villains in film and television shows. Notable examples include:\n\nComic books, manga, and anime are other venues for werecats.\n\nWerecats have been featured in a number of games, both video and table-top.\n\n"}

{"id": "2016915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016915", "title": "Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus", "text": "Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus\n\nThe ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), also known as the intermediate nucleus of the preoptic area (IPA), is a small cluster of neurons situated in the anterior hypothalamus, sitting just above and to the side of the optic chiasm in the brain of humans and other animals. The brain's sleep-promoting nuclei (e.g., the VLPO, parafacial zone, nucleus accumbens core, and lateral hypothalamic MCH neurons), together with the ascending arousal system which includes components in the brainstem, hypothalamus and basal forebrain, are the interconnected neural systems which control states of arousal, sleep, and transitions between these two states. The VLPO is active during sleep, particularly during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep), and releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, mainly GABA and galanin, which inhibit neurons of the ascending arousal system that are involved in wakefulness and arousal. The VLPO is in turn innervated by neurons from several components of the ascending arousal system. The VLPO is activated by the endogenous sleep-promoting substances adenosine and prostaglandin D2. The VLPO is inhibited during wakefulness by the arousal-inducing neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The role of the VLPO in sleep and wakefulness, and its association with sleep disorders – particularly insomnia and narcolepsy – is a growing area of neuroscience research.\n\nAt least 80% of neurons in the VLPO that project to the ascending arousal system are GABAergic (neurons that produce GABA). \n\"In vitro\" studies in rats have shown that many neurons in the VLPO that are inhibited by norepinephrine or acetylcholine are multipolar triangular shaped cells with low threshold spikes. These triangular multipolar neurons exist in two sub-populations in the VLPO:\n\nAs adenosine accumulates during wakefulness it is likely that type 2 cells play a role in sleep induction. \n\nThe remaining third of neurons in the VLPO are excited by norepinephrine. Their role is unclear.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Constantin von Economo noted that humans who had encephalitis with lesions in the anterior hypothalamus had insomnia, and proposed a sleep-promoting influence from that area. Animal studies in the mid-20th century in rats and cats confirmed that very large lesions in the preoptic area and basal forebrain resulted in insomnia but did not identify the cell group that was responsible. In 1996, Sherin and colleagues reported the presence of a cell group in the VLPO that expresses cFos (a protein often found in neurons that have recently been active) during sleep, and that these neurons contain the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and galanin. . These same neurons were found to innervate components of the ascending arousal system, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and other components of the lateral hypothalamus; the raphe nuclei; the locus coeruleus (LC); the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT); and the parabrachial nucleus (PB). More recent studies using opto- or chemogenetic activation of VLPO neurons have confirmed that they promote sleep.\n\nThe sleep-promoting effects of the VLPO neurons is thought to be due to release of GABA and possibly galanin that suppresses firing of arousal system neurons. As the VLPO is also inhibited by neurotransmitters released by components of the arousal systems, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, a current theory has proposed that the VLPO and the arousal system form a \"flip-flop\" circuit. This term from electrical engineering denotes a circuit in which mutual inhibition means that each component of the circuit, as it turns on, turns the other off, resulting in rapid transitions from one state (wake or sleep) to the other, with minimal time in transition states. This theory has been used to create mathematical models that explain much of the wake-sleep behavior in animals, including in pathological states and responses to drugs. Orexin neurons in the posterior lateral hypothalamus potentiate neurons in the ascending arousal system and help stabilize the brain in the waking state (and consolidated wakefulness, which builds up homeostatic sleep drive, helps stabilize the brain during later sleep). The loss of orexin neurons in the disorder narcolepsy destabilizes the wake-sleep switch, resulting in overwhelming sleep episodes during the waking day, as well as more frequent awakenings from sleep at night.\n\nThere is a strong circadian rhythm of sleep in mammals. The “master clock” for circadian rhythms in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN has little if any projection directly to the VLPO neurons. Instead, they project strongly to the adjacent subparaventricular zone, which in turn contains inhibitory GABAergic neurons that innervate the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Lesions of the dorsomedial nucleus almost completely eliminate the circadian rhythm of sleep. GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial nucleus innervate the VLPO, and glutamatergic neurons innervate the lateral hypothalamus, suggesting that the dorsomedial nucleus mainly promotes wakefulness during the active period (daytime for humans). \n\nElderly human patients with more galanin neurons in their intermediate nucleus (the human equivalent of the VLPO galanin neurons in rodents) have better, more continuous sleep. A reduced number of VLPO neurons is associated with more fragmented sleep (more awakenings throughout the night).\n\nLesions in the VLPO in rats results in 50-60% decrease in NREM sleep time and prolonged insomnia. More recent research suggests that stress-induced insomnia could be due to an imbalance of input to arousal system and VLPO neurons. \n\nMany sedative/hypnotic drugs act by binding to and potentiating GABA-A receptors. These include older drugs such as ethanol, chloral hydrate and barbiturates, as well as newer benzodiazepines and \"non-benzodiazepine\" drugs (such as zolpidem, which bind to the same receptor but have a different chemical configuration), and even anesthetics such as propofol and isoflurane. As the VLPO inputs to the arousal system use this same receptor, these drugs at low doses essentially act by potentiating the VLPO, producing a sleepy state. Animal studies show that VLPO neurons show cFos activation after sedative doses of these drugs, and that VLPO lesions produce resistance to their sedative effects. However, at high doses that produce a surgical plane of anesthesia, these drugs have much more widespread inhibitory effects, that do not depend upon the VLPO.\nStudies have shown that multiple sedative/hypnotic drugs that act by potentiating GABA-A receptors, including ethanol, chloral hydrate, propofol and gas anesthetics such as isoflurane, at sedative doses increase the activity of the VLPO neurons in mice. This finding suggests that at relatively low sedative doses, these medications may have a common mechanism of action, which includes potentiating the firing of VLPO neurons. High doses used in surgical anesthesia, however, reduce activity of neurons throughout the nervous system. \n"}

The GP60 was EMD's first engine that was classified as a \"third-generation\" locomotive. Hidden behind the electrical cabinet doors on the rear wall of the cab, the GP60 concealed a trio of microprocessors that monitored and managed a host of engine, cooling system and control functions. The engine's on-board microprocessors replaced hundreds of wiring circuits, dozens of relays and all but one module card, making it an improvement among EMD's engines.\n\nPower was provided by a 16-cylinder 710G3A diesel engine, which could produce . This locomotive was 59 feet 9 inches long and featured a fuel tank. The GP60 series shared the same frame as the GP59. Cabless 'B' units of this locomotive model were also built; they were known as GP60B models, purchased exclusively by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Units built with a North American Safety Cab were designated GP60M and all purchased by the Santa Fe. A total of 294 GP60, 23 GP60B and 63 GP60M units were built by EMD. Due to the mainstream focus of railroads on powerful six-axle units, and strict emissions standards, aside from the collaborations with Motive Power Incorporated, the GP60 is the last new EMD \"Geep\".\n\nSanta Fe followed its 40 standard-cab GP60s with an order for 63 custom GP60Ms. The GP60M featured North American Safety cabs, and was the only 60 Series B-B locomotive with this feature. The nose has a headlight that is slightly offset to the right to accommodate the front door. The first new units delivered in the road's revived \"Super Fleet\" Warbonnet Paint Scheme. Santa Fe GP60Ms 100–162 were delivered between May and September 1990. \n\n23 GP60 B units were built, all for Santa Fe. Taking advantage of the cabless configuration, the dynamic brake equipment on the GP60B was moved forward and away from the prime mover. Santa Fe 325–347 were the only GP60Bs. Some of these remain in service with BNSF.\n\nBNSF rebuilt GP60B 347 to a standard GP60 by applying the cab of a Union Pacific SD40-2 to the locomotive in 2010. It was then renumbered to BNSF 170, though it was renumbered again to BNSF 200 in 2014.\n\nRio Grande's first (and last) 60 series units were GP60s 3154–3156, built to SP specs in May 1990. \n\nSouthern Pacific purchased the first, last, and largest fleet of GP60s, ordering 195 units between December 1987 and February 1994. Nearly half of the SP Fleet was lettered for subsidiary Cotton Belt, but an even hundred were directly Southern Pacific.\n\nTwo units built for the Texas Mexican Railway were returned to lessor Helm Financial after Kansas City Southern acquired the \"Tex Mex\". The pair operated for a while in lease service on CSX, then were briefly on the roster of the Vermont Railway System (VRS) as its 381–382 before that carrier deemed them unsuitable for its operations. 381 was even repainted into VRS red and white before being returned to Helm in 2004.

He remained an unrepentant supporter of Nazism after the war and the pro-fascist views he allegedly expressed in his university lectures in the 1960s sparked major student demonstrations in Vienna that resulted in at least one fatality.\n\nTaras Borodajkewycz was born to Wladimir Borodajkewycz, Galician Ukrainian railway employee, and his wife Henriette (née Löwe). During the interwar years, he was an adherent of Catholic-national ideas which attempted to combine Catholic identity and pan-German politics. \n\nIn 1933, Borodajkewycz managed to become the President of the Austrian Katholikentag (Catholics Day). The event was an important gathering of the clerical regime of Engelbert Dollfuss and Austrofascism. Dollfuss was murdered by the Nazis in July 1934; but Borodajkewycz already in January 1934 became an illegal Austrian Nazi and member of the NSDAP. His party number was 6,124,741.\n\nHe was also a member of K.A.V. Norica Wien, a Catholic Studentenverbindung that was member of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen, from which he was expelled in 1945 because of his support of and membership in the NSDAP. Borodajkewycz received his doctorate in history from the University of Vienna in 1932 and worked as an assistant to the right-wing scholar Heinrich von Srbik, leading up to his habilitation in 1937 in religious and intellectual history. After a short period teaching at the University of Vienna and working as an archivist in the Viennese Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv, Borodajkewycz received appointment to a professorship of modern history at the German university in Prague, where he taught from 1943 to 1945.\n\nBorodajkewycz moved back to Austria after World War II and, despite his longstanding association with the NSDAP, was rapidly rehabilitated thanks to favorable political connections in the new Austrian government. He soon resumed his teaching career at the Vienna College of World Trade (\"Hochschule für Welthandel\"), the country's leading finance and business management school. However, his continued sympathies with National Socialism were apparent. He repeatedly made neo-Nazi and antisemitic remarks in his lectures that attracted a devoted following of students who shared his conservative, anti-leftist political leanings. But Borodajkewycz's unreconstructed views, once widely publicized, unleashed a legal battle and a series of social protests that exposed tensions over how post-war Austrian society was dealing with its Nazi past.\n\nBy 1939, the Sicherheitsdienst the intelligence agency of the SS used Borodajkewycz’s still existing excellent Catholic connections to entrust him with intelligence operations against the Vatican. His first task was to assess the chances of who will succeed Pope Pius XI. The Alvarez/Graham study mentions that Borodajkewycz already was an SD-informer at that time and that he volunteered to go to Rome to carry out this task. Throughout the war years, Borodajkewycz continued to be an SD spy against the Vatican.\n\nHints as to the fact that Borodajkewycz offered his espionage activities to the Soviets after 1945 were already voiced by the former Austrian State President Heinz Fischer in his famous book on Borodajkewycz. Fischer maintains that the GRU officer who contracted Borodajkewycz was the then Vienna Station Chief Resident, Colonel Stern. Later studies could show that the involvement of Borodajkewycz with the Soviets was much deeper and that Soviet intelligence agencies provided him with generous funding for his numerous business activities, especially in Western Austria, which at that time – until 1955 - was under Western Allied control. \n\nBorodajkewycz, after 1945, worked as senior book editor for the Salzburg-based book publishing company Otto Mueller Verlag. His major success was the publishing of the book by the Austrian art historian Hans Sedlmayr \"Verlust der Mitte\". \n\nThe Sedlmayr book, published in 1948, was a bestseller. According to Rathkolb, Borodajkewycz received royalties to the tune of 58000 €. Rathkolb emphasized that the cooperation with Hans Sedlmayr dated back to the 1930s.\n\nIn 1962, Heinz Fischer, future President of Austria, attacked Borodajkewycz in a journal article over remarks made during a lecture, which he reported based on a fellow-student's class notes. Since he did not want to identify the student (Ferdinand Lacina, later Austrian minister of finance, who had not graduated yet and might not have been able to do so had he been revealed), Fischer was successfully sued by Borodajkewycz for defamation, and had to pay a fine. Borodajkewycz felt encouraged by the verdict and disclosed his views more openly in his lectures from that time onwards.\n\nIn March 1965, student groups, former resistance members, and unions organized a demonstration to call for Borodajkewycz's removal. The demonstration clashed with a countermarch organized by the \"Ring Freiheitlicher Studenten\", the student organization of the Freedom Party of Austria. Ernst Kirchweger, a former resistance member and concentration camp survivor, who was watching the demonstrations but not participating himself, was seriously injured by a right-wing demonstrator. He died some days after the demonstration, becoming the first political death of the Second Republic.\n\nIn April 1965, the defamation trial against Fischer was reopened, and he was acquitted on the basis of a testimony by Lacina, who had graduated in the meantime. An appeal by Borodajkewicz was rejected. Another lawsuit attempted to implicate Borodajkewicz in Kirchweger's death, but he was exonerated.\n\nUltimately, Borodajkewycz was forced to take early retirement (with full salary), despite strong efforts by the minister of education, Theodor Piffl-Percevic, to defend him. During the following years, he continued to publish articles in right-wing journals.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2016931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016931", "title": "Presidency of Thomas Jefferson", "text": "Presidency of Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe presidency of Thomas Jefferson began on March 4, 1801, when he was inaugurated as the third President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1809. Jefferson assumed the office after defeating incumbent President John Adams in the 1800 presidential election. The election was a realigning election in which the Democratic-Republican Party swept the Federalist Party out of power, ushering in a generation of Democratic-Republican dominance in American politics. After serving two terms, Jefferson was succeeded by Secretary of State James Madison, also of the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nJefferson took office determined to roll back the Federalist program of the 1790s. His administration reduced taxes, government spending, and the national debt, and repealed the Alien and Sedition Acts. In foreign affairs, the major developments were the acquisition of the gigantic Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803, an embargo against trade with both Great Britain and France, and worsening relations with Britain as the United States tried to remain neutral in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars that engulfed Europe. He established a military academy, used the Navy to protect merchant ships from Barbary pirates in North Africa, and developed a plan to protect U.S. ports from foreign invasion by the use of small gunboats (a plan that proved useless when war came in 1812). He also authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nDuring his second term, Jefferson's attention was focused on the trial of then former Vice President Burr for treason, which resulted in an acquittal, and on the issue of slavery, specifically the importation of slaves from abroad. In 1806, he denounced the international slave trade as a \"violation of human rights\" and called upon Congress to criminalize it. Congress responded by approving the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves the following year. Rising tensions between the United States and Britain dominated the final years of Jefferson's second term, as the Royal Navy began impressing sailors from American ships and attacking American shipping. Jefferson rejected war and instead used economic threats and embargoes that ultimately hurt the U.S. more than Britain. The disputes with Britain continued after Jefferson left office, eventually leading to the War of 1812.\n\nDespite the economic and political troubles caused by naval tensions with Britain, Jefferson was succeeded by his preferred successor in the form of James Madison. His legacy remained highly influential until the American Civil War, but his reputation has ebbed and flowed since then. Nonetheless, in surveys of academic historians and political scientists, Jefferson is consistently ranked as one of the nation's most esteemed presidents.\n\nJefferson ran for president in the 1796 election as a Democratic-Republican, but finished second in the electoral vote to Federalist John Adams; under the laws then in place, Jefferson's second-place finish made him the Vice President of the United States. Jefferson strongly opposed the Federalist program, including the Alien and Sedition Acts, and the nation became increasingly polarized. Jefferson and Adams were once again the major presidential candidates of their respective parties in the 1800 presidential election, and Aaron Burr was the Democratic-Republican Party's vice presidential nominee. Adams's campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War. The Democratic-Republicans accused the Federalists of being secret monarchists, while the Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French.\n\nUnder the election system in place at the time, the members of the Electoral College were permitted to vote for two names for president; any tie would be decided in a contingent election in the United States House of Representatives. Jefferson and Burr each received 73 electoral votes, while Adams finished in third place with 65 votes. The House of Representatives, still controlled by the Federalists, held a contingent election in February 1801 to decide whether Jefferson or Burr would accede to the presidency. Though some Federalists preferred Burr, Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton strongly preferred Jefferson. On the thirty-sixth ballot of the contingent election, enough Federalists congressmen abstained from the vote to allow Jefferson to win the presidency. Jefferson regarded his victory as \"America's Second Revolution,\" and he hoped to transform the country by limiting government and weakening the power of elites.\n\nJefferson's first inauguration, on March 4, 1801, was the first to be held in the nation's new capital, Washington, D.C. That morning an artillery company on Capitol Hill had fired shots to welcome the daybreak, and in a first for a newspaper, Jefferson gave a copy of his speech to the \"National Intelligencer\" for it to be published and available right after delivery. He delivered a 1721 word speech in the United States Capitol's Senate Chamber. He was not a strong speaker, and the audience could barely catch his words, which called for national unity. The speech was widely reprinted and celebrated by Democratic-Republicans across the country as a clear statement of the party's principles. The presidential oath of office was administered by Chief Justice John Marshall. Outgoing President Adams had left the capital earlier that day, and did not attend the ceremony.\n\nBy July 1801, Jefferson had assembled his cabinet, which consisted of Secretary of State James Madison, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, Attorney General Levi Lincoln Sr., and Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith. After his decision to pursue the presidency in the contingent election, Burr was excluded from any role in the Jefferson administration. Jefferson sought to make collective decisions with his cabinet, and each member's opinion was elicited before Jefferson made major decisions. Gallatin and Madison were particularly influential within Jefferson's cabinet; they held the two most important cabinet positions and served as Jefferson's key lieutenants.\n\nWhen Adams took office in 1797, he carried many of outgoing President George Washington's supporters over into his new administration. As a result, there was little change in the federal government during the transition between Washington and Adams, the first presidential transition in U.S. history. With Jefferson's election in 1800, there was a transfer of power between parties, not simply a transition between presidents. As president, Jefferson had the power of appointment to fill many government positions that had long been held by Federalists. Jefferson resisted the calls of his fellow Democratic-Republicans to remove all Federalists from their appointed positions, but he felt that it was his right to replace the top government officials, including the cabinet. He also replaced any lower-ranking Federalist appointees who engaged in misconduct or partisan behavior. Jefferson's refusal to call for a complete replacement of federal appointees under a \"spoils system\" was followed by his successors until the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828.\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, Adams had appointed numerous federal judges to fill positions created by the Judiciary Act of 1801. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the appointment of these \"midnight judges,\" almost all of whom were Federalists. Jefferson and his allies sought to reverse the Judiciary Act of 1801, partly because they did not believe the new judicial positions were necessary, and partly to weaken Federalist influence on the courts. Federalists vehemently opposed this plan, arguing that Congress did not have the power to abolish judicial positions that were occupied. Despite these objections, the Democratic-Republicans passed the Judiciary Act of 1802, which largely restored the judicial structure that had prevailed prior to the Judiciary Act of 1801. The Jefferson administration also refused to deliver judicial commissions to some Adams appointees who had won Senate confirmation but had not yet formally taken office. One such appointee, William Marbury, sued Secretary of State Madison to compel him to deliver the judicial commissions. In the 1803 Supreme Court case of \"Marbury v. Madison\", the court ruled against Marbury, but also established the precedent of judicial review, thereby strengthening the judicial branch.\n\nStill unhappy with Federalist power on the bench even after the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1802, the Democratic-Republicans impeached district court Judge John Pickering and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. Federalist congressmen strongly opposed both impeachments, criticizing them as attacks on judicial independence. Pickering, who frequently presided over cases while drunk, was convicted by the Senate in 1804. However, the impeachment proceedings of Chase proved more difficult. While serving on the Supreme Court, Chase had frequently expressed his skepticism of democracy, predicting that the nation would \"sink into mobocracy,\" but he had not shown himself to be incompetent in the same way that Pickering had. Several Democratic-Republican senators joined the Federalists in opposing Chase's removal, and Chase would remain on the court until his death in 1811. Though Federalists would never regain the political power they had held during the 1790s, the Marshall Court continued to reflect Federalist ideals until the 1830s.\n\nJefferson appointed three people to the Supreme Court during his presidency. The first vacancy of Jefferson's presidency arose due to the resignation of Alfred Moore. Determined to appoint a Democratic-Republican from a state unrepresented on the Court, Jefferson selected William Johnson, a young attorney who had previously served as an appellate judge in South Carolina. After the death of William Paterson in 1806, Jefferson appointed Henry Brockholst Livingston, a justice of the New York Supreme Court. After Congress added another seat to the Supreme Court with the Seventh Circuit Act of 1807, Jefferson asked individual members of Congress for their recommendations on filling the vacancy. Though Representative George W. Campbell of Tennessee emerged as the most popular choice in Congress, Jefferson was unwilling to appoint a sitting member of Congress. Jefferson instead appointed Thomas Todd, another individual popular among members of Congress, and who served as the chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Jefferson hoped that his appointments would weaken Chief Justice Marshall's influence on the Court, but, with the partial exception of Johnson, his Supreme Court appointments tended to support Marshall's decisions. Jefferson also appointed seven United States circuit court judges and nine United States district court judges.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, many Federalists hoped that society would remain largely as it had been during the colonial era, but Jefferson wanted to upend the social order. He advocated a philosophy that historians would later call Jeffersonian democracy, which was marked by his belief in agrarianism and strict limits on the national government. In a world in which few believed in democracy or egalitarianism, Jefferson's belief in political equality for white men stood out from many of the other Founding Fathers of the United States, who continued to believe that the rich and powerful should lead society. Under pressure from Jeffersonian Republicans, states achieved universal white manhood suffrage by eliminating property requirements. Expanding suffrage and the mobilization of ordinary people ensured that individuals outside of the elite class had the opportunity to become government officials, especially in the North. Prior to the 1790s, campaigning was considered an interference on each citizen's right to think and vote independently. Without competition for office, voter turnouts were often low, sometimes fewer than 5 percent of eligible men. With the rise of the two-party system, many regions saw voter participation rise to approximately 20 percent in the 1790s and to 80 percent during Jefferson's presidency. Wood writes, \"by the standards of the early nineteenth century America possessed the most popular electoral politics in the world.\"\n\nThe egalitarianism of the age extended beyond voting rights, as the practice of indentured servitude declined and traditional hierarchies in employment and education were challenged. In a reflection of his own belief in egalitarianism, Jefferson broke with many of the precedents set by Adams and Washington. Jefferson accepted visitors without regard to social status, discontinued the practice of delivering speeches to Congress in person, and enforced a less formal protocol at White House events.\n\nIn reaction to the expansion of the franchise, even Federalists began to adopt partisan techniques, such as party organization, newspapers, and the establishment of auxiliary societies. The Federalists peacefully accepted the transfer of power to the Democratic-Republicans in 1800, but most party leaders hoped that it would be just a temporary anomaly. Many Federalists continued to serve in state or local office, though prominent Federalists like John Jay and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney retired from public life. Reflecting the fears of other ambitious young Federalists, John Quincy Adams wrote that the Federalist Party had been \"completely and irrevocably abandoned...it never can and never will be revived.\" As Jefferson's presidency continued, Adams's prediction proved accurate, and the Federalists struggled to compete outside of New England.\n\nMuch of Jefferson's early agenda focused on undoing the Federalist program of the 1790s. Upon taking office, he repealed the remaining provisions of the Alien and Sedition Acts and pardoned all ten individuals who had been prosecuted under the acts. He also began dismantling Hamilton's fiscal system with help from Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin. Jefferson's administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing \"unnecessary offices\" and cutting \"useless establishments and expenses\". After the repeal of these taxes, over 90 percent of federal revenue came from import duties. Despite Jefferson's earlier opposition to the national bank, Gallatin persuaded Jefferson to retain the First Bank of the United States. With the repeal of the Federalist program, many Americans had little contact with the federal government, with the exception of the postal service.\n\nJefferson's ultimate goal was to abolish the national debt, which he believed to be inherently dangerous and immoral. Though Gallatin and Jefferson did not find as much Federalist governmental waste as they had expected, their fiscal cuts and the benign economic conditions that persisted for much of Jefferson's presidency allowed them to run budget surpluses. Jefferson shrank the army and the navy, deeming them largely unnecessary in peacetime. He transformed the navy into a fleet consisting of inexpensive gunboats used only for defense, with the idea that they would not provoke foreign hostilities. His administration discharged numerous soldiers, leaving the army with 3,350 officers and enlisted men. At the end of his two terms, Jefferson had lowered the national debt from $83 million to $57 million. In 1806, believing that the country would soon abolish its national debt, Jefferson proposed enlarging the army and passing a constitutional amendment to explicitly allow Congress to spend funds on internal improvements and education, but these proposals were not acted on by Congress. That same year, Congress authorized the construction of the National Road, a route designed to connect the East Coast to St. Louis, although construction on the road did not begin until 1811.\n\nIn the early 1800s, much of the American frontier was subject to the competing claims of settlers, land speculators, and Native Americans. The Yazoo lands of western Georgia were no exception, and they emerged as point of major tension during Jefferson's administration. In what became known as the Yazoo land scandal, Georgia had engaged in a massive real estate fraud by selling large tracts of Yazoo land before passing a law retroactively invalidating the grants. With the Compact of 1802, the federal government purchased western Georgia (now the states of Alabama and Mississippi), agreed to seek to extinguish all Native American claims in the region, and also agreed to settle all claims against the land from those who had been defrauded in the scandal. In 1804, Jefferson sought to compensate those defrauded in the Yazoo land scandal by giving them some of the lands acquired in the compact, but Congressman John Randolph successfully mobilized opposition to the proposal, castigating it as a giveaway to land speculators. The incident marked the start of a factionalism within the Democratic-Republican Party that would prove problematic for Jefferson and his successors, as Randolph's \"tertium quids\" freely criticized presidents of their own party. Controversy over the Yazoo lands would continue until 1814, when Congress finally agreed to compensate the claimants.\n\nEven before the 1803 purchase of the Louisiana Territory, Jefferson had begun planning for an expedition to the lands west of the Mississippi River. Jefferson considered it important for the United States to establish a claim of \"discovery\" to Oregon Country by documenting and establishing an American presence there before Europeans could establish strong claims. Jefferson also hoped the expedition would discover the long-sought-for Northwest Passage to the Pacific Ocean, which would greatly promote commerce and trade for the country. In 1804, he appointed his personal secretary Meriwether Lewis, along with William Clark, as the leaders of a western expedition, dubbing it the \"Corps of Discovery\". Jefferson chose Lewis to lead the expedition rather than someone with only the best scientific credentials because of Lewis' military experience in the woods and \"familiarity with the Indian manners and character.\" Jefferson possessed the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, and before the expedition he tutored Lewis in the sciences of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, astronomy, and navigation.\n\nIn May 1804, the Corps of Discovery, consisting of about 40 men, departed from St. Louis and traveled up the Missouri River. Guided by Sacagawea and various Native American tribes along the way, the expedition, traveling on the Columbia River, reached the Pacific Ocean by November 1805. After the winter thaw the expedition began their return trip on March 22, 1806, and returned to St. Louis on September 23 that year, adding a wealth of scientific and geographical knowledge of the vast territory, along with knowledge of the many Indian tribes. Two months after the expedition's end, Jefferson made his first public statement to Congress giving a one sentence summary about its success before asserting the justification for the expenses involved. The American Philosophical Society ultimately became the repository for many of the expedition's findings, including seeds, fossils, plant, and other specimens. In 1808, businessman John Jacob Astor established a transcontinental fur trading company, and in 1811 his company established Fort Astoria, the first American settlement on the Pacific Coast.\n\nIn addition to the \"Corps of Discovery\", Jefferson organized other western exploration expeditions, some of which traveled through Spanish territory. William Dunbar and George Hunter led an expedition on the Ouachita River, Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis led the Red River Expedition, and Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. All of the exploration expeditions sent out under Jefferson's presidency produced valuable information about the American frontier.\n\nJefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university that could produce a competent officer engineering corps that would not have to rely on foreign sources for top grade engineers. An academy would also help to replace many of the Federalist officers who Jefferson dismissed when he took office. Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act on March 16, 1802, thus founding the United States Military Academy at West Point. The Act documented in 29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military.\n\nIn reaction to the Electoral College tie between Jefferson and Burr in 1800, Congress approved an amendment to the United States Constitution providing a new procedure for electing the president and vice president, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification in December 1803. The Twelfth Amendment was ratified by the requisite number of states (then 13) to become part of the Constitution in June 1804.\n\nOne new state, Ohio, was admitted to the Union while Jefferson was in office. The exact date upon which Ohio became a state is unclear. On April 30, 1802, the 7th Congress had passed an act \"authorizing the inhabitants of Ohio to form a Constitution and state government, and admission of Ohio into the Union.\" On February 19, 1803, the same Congress passed an act \"providing for the execution of the laws of the United States in the State of Ohio.\" Neither act, however, set a formal date of statehood. An official statehood date for Ohio was not set until 1953, when the 83rd Congress passed a Joint resolution \"for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union\", which designated March 1, 1803, as that date. It was the first state created from the Northwest Territory.\n\nFor decades prior to Jefferson's accession to office, the Barbary Coast pirates of North Africa had been capturing American merchant ships, pillaging valuable cargoes and enslaving crew members, demanding huge ransoms for their release. Before independence, American merchant ships were protected from the Barbary pirates by the naval and diplomatic influence of Great Britain, but that protection came to end after the colonies won their independence. In 1794, in reaction to the attacks, Congress had passed a law to authorize the payment of tribute to the Barbary States. At the same time, Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794, which initiated construction on six frigates that became the foundation of the United States Navy. By the end of the 1790s, the United States had concluded treaties with all of the Barbary States, but weeks before Jefferson took office Tripoli began attacking American merchant ships in an attempt to extract further tribute.\n\nJefferson was reluctant to become involved in any kind of international conflict, but he believed that force would best deter the Barbary States from demanding further tribute. He ordered the U.S. Navy into the Mediterranean Sea to defend against the Barbary Pirates, beginning the First Barbary War. The administration's initial efforts were largely ineffective, and in 1803 the frigate was captured by Tripoli. In February 1804, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a successful raid on Tripoli's harbor that burned the \"Philadelphia\", making Decatur a national hero. Jefferson and the young American navy forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli which ultimately moved it out of the war. Jefferson also ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli, which restored peace in the Mediterranean for a while, although Jefferson continued to pay the remaining Barbary States until the end of his presidency.\n\nJefferson believed that western expansion played an important role in furthering his vision of a republic of yeoman farmers. By the time Jefferson took office, Americans had settled as far west as the Mississippi River, though vast pockets of land remained vacant or inhabited only by Native Americans. Many in the United States, particularly those in the west, favored further territorial expansion, and especially hoped to annex the Spanish province of Louisiana. Given Spain's sparse presence in Louisiana, Jefferson believed that it was just a matter of time until Louisiana fell to either Britain or the United States. U.S. expansionary hopes were temporarily dashed when Napoleon convinced Spain to transfer the province to France in the 1801 Treaty of Aranjuez. Though French pressure played a role in the conclusion of the treaty, the Spanish also believed that French control of Louisiana would help protect New Spain from American expansion.\n\nNapoleon's dreams of a re-established French colonial empire in North America threatened to reignite the tensions of the recently concluded Quasi-War. He initially planned to re-establish a French empire in the Americas centered around New Orleans and Saint-Domingue, a sugar-producing Caribbean island in the midst of a slave revolution. One army was sent to Saint-Domingue, and a second army began preparing to travel to New Orleans. After French forces in Saint-Domingue were defeated by the rebels, Napoleon gave up on his plans for an empire in the Western Hemisphere. In early 1803, Jefferson dispatched James Monroe to France to join ambassador Robert Livingston in purchasing New Orleans, East Florida, and West Florida from France. To the surprise of the American delegation, Napoleon offered to sell the entire territory of Louisiana for $15 million. The Americans also pressed for the acquisition of the Floridas, but under the terms of the Treaty of Aranjuez, Spain retained control of both of those territories. On April 30, the two delegations agreed to the terms of the Louisiana Purchase, and Napoleon gave his approval the following day.\n\nAfter Secretary of State James Madison gave his assurances that the purchase was well within even the strictest interpretation of the Constitution, the Senate quickly ratified the treaty, and the House immediately authorized funding. The purchase, concluded in December 1803, marked the end of French ambitions in North America and ensured American control of the Mississippi River. The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States, and Treasury Secretary Gallatin was forced to borrow from foreign banks to finance the payment to France. Though the Louisiana Purchase was widely popular, some Federalists criticized it; Congressman Fisher Ames wrote, \"We are to give money of which we have too little for land of which we already have too much.\" \n\nHaving been dropped from the 1804 Democratic-Republican ticket, Burr ran for the position of Governor of New York in an April 1804 election, and was defeated. Federalist Party leader Alexander Hamilton was a key factor in Burr's defeat in running in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election, having made callous remarks regarding Burr. Believing that his honor was offended, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. On July 11, 1804, Burr mortally wounded Hamilton in a duel at Weehawken, New Jersey. Burr was indicted for Hamilton's murder in New York and New Jersey causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained President of the Senate during Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase's impeachment trial. The two Burr indictments were \"quietly allowed to die\".\n\nAfter Aaron Burr was disgraced in the duel of 1804 and his own presidential ambitions were ended, he was reported by the British ambassador as wanting to \"effect a separation of the western part of the United States [at the Appalachian Mountains]\". Jefferson believed that to be so by November 1806, because Burr had been rumored to be variously plotting with some western states to secede for an independent empire, or to raise a filibuster to conquer Mexico. At the very least, there were reports of Burr's recruiting men, stocking arms, and building boats. New Orleans seemed especially vulnerable, but at some point, the American general there, James Wilkinson, a double agent for the Spanish, decided to turn on Burr. Jefferson issued a proclamation warning that there were U.S. citizens illegally plotting to take over Spanish holdings. Though Burr was nationally discredited, Jefferson feared for the very Union. In a report to Congress January 1807, Jefferson declared Burr's guilt \"placed beyond question\". By March 1807, Burr was arrested in New Orleans and placed on trial for treason in Richmond, Virginia, with Chief Justice John Marshall presiding. On June 13, Jefferson was subpoenaed by Burr to release documents that favored Burr's defense. Jefferson stated he had no loyalty to Burr and only released a few documents Burr had requested having invoked executive privilege. Jefferson refused to appear at Burr's trial. The weak government case led to Burr's acquittal, but with his reputation ruined he was never able to mount another adventure. Burr later died on his Staten Island residence in October 1836.\n\nAfter early 1802, when he learned that Napoleon intended to regain a foothold in Saint-Domingue and Louisiana, Jefferson proclaimed neutrality in relation to the Haitian Revolution. The U.S. allowed war contraband to \"continue to flow to the blacks through usual U.S. merchant channels and the administration would refuse all French requests for assistance, credits, or loans.\" The \"geopolitical and commercial implications\" of Napoleon's plans outweighed Jefferson's fears of a slave-led nation. After the rebels in Saint-Domingue proclaimed independence from France in the new republic of Haiti in 1804, Jefferson refused to recognize Haiti as the second independent republic in the Americas. In part he hoped to win Napoleon's support over the acquisition of Florida. American slaveholders had been frightened and horrified by the slave massacres of the planter class during the rebellion and after, and a southern-dominated Congress was \"hostile to Haiti.\" They feared its success would encourage slave revolt in the American South. Historian Tim Matthewson notes that Jefferson \"acquiesced in southern policy, the embargo of trade and nonrecognition, the defense of slavery internally and the denigration of Haiti abroad.\" According to the historian George Herring, \"the Florida diplomacy reveals him [Jefferson] at his worst. His lust for land trumped his concern for principle.\"\n\nJefferson's non-recognition of Haiti did little to advance his goal of acquiring East Florida and West Florida, which remained under the control of Spain. Jefferson argued that the Louisiana Purchase had extended as far west as the Rio Grande River, and had included West Florida as far east as the Perdido River. He hoped to use that claim, along with French pressure, to force Spain to sell both West Florida and East Florida. In 1806, he won congressional approval of a $2 million appropriation to obtain the Floridas; eager expansionists also contemplated authorizing the president to acquire Canada, by force if necessary. In this case, unlike that of the Louisiana Territory, the dynamics of European politics worked against Jefferson. Napoleon had played Washington against Madrid to see what he could get, but by 1805 Spain was his ally. Spain had no desire to cede Florida, which was part of its leverage against an expanding United States. Revelations of the bribe which Jefferson offered to France over the matter provoked outrage and weakened Jefferson's hand, and he subsequently gave up on Florida.\n\nIn keeping with his Enlightenment thinking, President Jefferson adopted an assimilation policy towards American Indians known as his \"civilization program\" which included securing peaceful U.S. – Indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral for repayment. Various tribes accepted Jefferson's policies, including the Shawnees led by Black Hoof and the Creek. However, Jefferson dreamed of a transcontinental nation, and he became increasingly skeptical of assimilation efforts. As his presidency continued, Jefferson prioritized white settlement of the western territories over peaceful assimilation.\n\nWhen Jefferson assumed power, the Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa were leading raids against American settlements in the Ohio Valley, with munitions provided by British traders in Canada. Attempting to form a confederation of Indian people in the Northwest Territory, the two brothers would be a continual source of irritation to westward settlers. The Indian Nations followed Tenskwatawa who had a vision of purifying his society by expelling American settlers, the \"children of the Evil Spirit\". The success of the Indians gave Britain hope that it could create an Indian satellite nation in parts of the American territory. The raids became a major cause of the later War of 1812.\n\nIn the 1790s, many anti-slavery leaders had come to believe that the institution of slavery would become extinct in the United States in the foreseeable future. These hopes lay in part on the enthusiasm for the abolition of slavery in the North, and in the decline of the importation of slaves throughout the South. The Constitution had included a provision preventing Congress from enacting a law banning the importation of slaves until 1808. In the years before Jefferson took office, the growing fear of slave rebellions led to diminished enthusiasm in the South for the abolition of slavery, and many states began to enact Black Codes designed to restrict the behavior of free blacks. During his presidential term, Jefferson was disappointed that the younger generation was making no move to abolish slavery; he largely avoided the issue until 1806. He did succeed in convincing Congress to block the foreign importation of slaves into the newly purchased Louisiana Territory.\n\nSeeing that in 1808 the twenty-year constitutional ban on ending the international slave trade would expire, in December 1806 in his presidential message to Congress, he called for a law to ban it. He denounced the trade as \"violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, in which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe.\" Jefferson signed the new law and the international trade became illegal in January 1808. The legal trade had averaged 14,000 slaves a year; illegal smuggling at the rate of about 1000 slaves a year continued for decades. \"The two major achievements of Jefferson's presidency were the Louisiana Purchase and the abolition of the slave trade,\" according to historian John Chester Miller.\n\nAmerican trade boomed after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in the early 1790s, in large part because American shipping was allowed to act as neutral carriers with European powers. Though the British sought to restrict trade with the French, they had largely tolerated U.S. trade with mainland France and French colonies after the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1794. Jefferson favored a policy of neutrality in the European wars, and was strongly committed the principle of freedom of navigation for neutral vessels, including American ships. Early in his tenure, Jefferson was able to maintain cordial relations with both France and Britain, but relations with Britain deteriorated after 1805. Needing sailors, the British Royal Navy seized hundreds of American ships and impressed 6,000 sailors from them, angering Americans. The British began to enforce a blockade of Europe, ending their policy of tolerance towards American shipping. Though the British returned many seized American goods that had not been intended for French ports, the British blockade badly affected American commerce and provoked immense anger throughout the nation. Aside from commercial concerns, Americans were outraged by what they saw an attack on national honor. In response to the attacks, Jefferson recommended an expansion of the navy, and Congress passed the Non-importation Act, which restricted many, but not all, British imports.\n\nTo restore peaceful relations with Britain, Monroe negotiated the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty, which would have represented an extension of the Jay Treaty. Jefferson had never favored the Jay Treaty, which had prevented the United States from implementing economic sanctions on Britain, and he rejected the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty. Tensions with Britain heightened due to the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, a June 1807 naval confrontation between an American ship and a British ship that ended in the death or impressment of several American sailors. Beginning with the Napoleon's December 1807 Milan Decree, the French began to seize ships trading with the British, leaving American shipping vulnerable to attacks by both of the major naval powers. In response to attacks on American shipping, Congress passed the Embargo Act in 1807, which was designed to force Britain and France into respecting U.S. neutrality by cutting off all American shipping to Britain or France. Almost immediately the Americans began to turn to smuggling in order to ship goods to Europe. Defying his own limited government principles, Jefferson used the military to enforce the embargo. Imports and exports fell immensely, and the embargo proved to be especially unpopular in New England. In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations aside from Britain and France.\n\nMost historians consider Jefferson's embargo to have been ineffective and harmful to American interests. Even the top officials of the Jefferson administration viewed the embargo as a flawed policy, but they saw it as preferable to war. Appleby describes the strategy as Jefferson's \"least effective policy\", and Joseph Ellis calls it \"an unadulterated calamity\". Others, however, portray it as an innovative, nonviolent measure which aided France in its war with Britain while preserving American neutrality. Jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of \"republican virtue.\" He maintained that, had the embargo been widely observed, it would have avoided war in 1812.\n\nLike both of his predecessors, Jefferson ran for a second term. The election of 1804 was the first to be held after the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, which instituted the current electoral system in which separate electoral votes are cast for the presidency and vice presidency. With Burr having little chance at re-nomination, the party's congressional nominating caucus chose Governor George Clinton of New York as Jefferson's running mate. The Federalists nominated Charles Cotesworth Pinckney for president and Rufus King for vice president. The Federalists made attacks on Jefferson's alleged atheism, his support for democratization, and his affair with Sally Hemings the centerpiece of their campaign, arguing that Jefferson's affair with an enslaved woman was hypocritical given his continuing support for slavery. The Democratic-Republicans enjoyed a marked advantage in party organization, while the Federalists and their ethos of government-by-the-elite were becoming increasingly unpopular. Jefferson won every state except for Connecticut and Delaware, taking 162 of the 174 electoral votes.\n\nJefferson, who believed that incumbents should not serve indefinitely, followed the two-term tradition precedent established by Washington, and declined to seek a third term. Instead, he endorsed his advisor and friend James Madison for the presidency. Jefferson's assertive foreign policy created intra-party criticism from the tertium quids, led by Randolph. Randolph and other powerful Democratic-Republican leaders opposed to Madison, including Samuel Smith and William Duane, rallied around the potential candidacy of James Monroe. Additionally, Vice President Clinton, who had accepted the vice presidential nomination again, announced his own candidacy for President. It took all of Jefferson's prestige and charm to convince dissident Democratic-Republicans not to bolt from the party out of disdain for Madison. In the end, Madison, headed off the intra-party challenges and defeated Federalist nominee Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, winning 122 of the 176 electoral votes in the 1808 election.\n\nMeacham opines that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren. Jefferson's reputation declined during the Civil War due to his support of states' rights. In the late 19th century, his legacy was widely criticized; conservatives felt his democratic philosophy had led to that era's populist movement, while Progressives sought a more activist federal government than Jefferson's philosophy allowed. Both groups saw Hamilton as vindicated by history, rather than Jefferson, and President Woodrow Wilson even described Jefferson as \"though a great man, not a great American\".\n\nIn the 1930s, Jefferson was held in higher esteem; President Franklin D. Roosevelt and New Deal Democrats celebrated his struggles for \"the common man\" and reclaimed him as their party's founder. Jefferson became a symbol of American democracy in the incipient Cold War, and the 1940s and '50s saw the zenith of his popular reputation. Following the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s, Jefferson's slaveholding came under new scrutiny, particularly after DNA testing in the late 1990s supported allegations he had a relationship with Sally Hemings. Noting the huge output of scholarly books on Jefferson in recent years, historian Gordon Wood summarizes the raging debates about Jefferson's stature: \"Although many historians and others are embarrassed about his contradictions and have sought to knock him off the democratic pedestal ... his position, though shaky, still seems secure.\"\n\nPolls of historians and political scientists generally rank Jefferson as one of the best presidents, often just outside the top three. The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents, and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of the American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president. Though historians tend to think highly of Jefferson's overall performance as president, a 2006 poll of historians ranked the Embargo Act of 1807 as the seventh-worst mistake made by a sitting president.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016938", "title": "Rotten Row", "text": "Rotten Row\n\nRotten Row is a broad track running along the south side of Hyde Park in London. It leads from Hyde Park Corner to Serpentine Road. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Rotten Row was a fashionable place for upper-class Londoners to be seen horse riding. Today it is maintained as a place to ride horses in the centre of London, but it is little used as such.\n\nRotten Row was established by William III at the end of the 17th century. Having moved court to Kensington Palace, William wanted a safer way to travel to St. James's Palace. He created the broad avenue through Hyde Park, lit with 300 oil lamps in 1690– the first artificially lit highway in Britain. The lighting was a precaution against highwaymen, who lurked in Hyde Park at the time. The track was called \"Route du Roi\", French for King's Road, which was eventually corrupted into \"Rotten Row\".\n\nIn the 18th century, Rotten Row became a popular meeting place for upper-class Londoners. Particularly on weekend evenings and at midday, people dressed in their finest clothes to ride along the row and be seen. The adjacent South Carriage Drive was used by society people in carriages for the same purpose. In 1876, it was reconstructed as a horse-ride, with a brick base covered by sand.\nThe sand-covered avenue of Rotten Row is maintained as a bridleway and forms part of Hyde Park's South Ride. It is convenient for the Household Cavalry, stabled nearby at Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, to exercise their horses.

The picture was made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Delmer Daves and produced by Frank Ross. The screenplay was written by Philip Dunne based on characters created by Lloyd C. Douglas in \"The Robe\".\n\nThe movie presents Victor Mature as Demetrius, a Christian slave made to fight in the Roman arena as a gladiator, and Susan Hayward as Messalina, a reprobate who is the wife of Claudius, the uncle of the depraved emperor Caligula. The cast also features Ernest Borgnine, William Marshall, Michael Rennie, Jay Robinson as Caligula, Debra Paget, Anne Bancroft in one of her earlier roles, and Julie Newmar as a briefly seen dancing entertainer. The film is in Technicolor and CinemaScope.\n\nThe film begins with a clip from the previous film, showing its central characters Marcellus and Diana going to be martyred for their Christian beliefs on the order of Emperor Caligula. Before being executed, Diana hands the Robe of Christ to Marcellus' servant Marcipor (David Leonard), telling him that it is \"for the Big Fisherman,\" meaning Peter, who was a fisherman before being called as an apostle.\n\nPeter (Michael Rennie) hands the Robe to Demetrius while at the funeral of Marcellus and Diana before leaving on a journey to live in 'the north'. Caligula (Jay Robinson) becomes interested in the Robe, thinking that it has magic powers and will bring him the 'eternal life' that Jesus had spoken of. He accosts his uncle Claudius (Barry Jones), wanting to know what had happened to it.\n\nDemetrius, looking out for his Lucia (Debra Paget) and the Robe and refusing to reveal its location, is arrested for assaulting a Roman soldier and sentenced to the arena. Demetrius fights and saves his opponent. The tigers are then set on him, but he kills them. Caligula then assigns him to be Messalina's bodyguard. Later, Messalina is accused of wanting Caligula dead and plotting his murder, but manipulates her way out of the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Lucia disguises herself to gain entrance to the gladiator school to see Demetrius. However, the two are forcibly separated on orders of Messalina (Susan Hayward), Claudius' wife. Lucia is then assaulted by Dardanius (Richard Egan) and the other gladiators, forcibly kissing her and trying to carry her to private chambers. Demetrius in desperation prays for God to save her, and suddenly it appears that Dardanius has broken Lucia's neck. All present are shocked at Lucia's apparent death, especially Demetrius, and he loses all his faith in Jesus Christ as God.\n\nPreviously, he had avoided killing anyone in the Emperor's games because of his religion, but all that now changes. His next time in the arena, not only does he fight, but he ferociously kills all the gladiators that took part in the attack on Lucia. The Roman spectators, including the Emperor, are thrilled. Demetrius is freed, and allowed to join the Praetorian Guard. Caligula asks if Demetrius renounces Christ; he does, and once Demetrius does this, Caligula frees him and inducts him into the guard with the rank of Tribune.\n\nAs a Roman tribune, Demetrius rejects the teachings of Christ (and of Isis when encountering Messalina praying to her statue), beginning an affair with Messalina. When Peter comes to visit them, he turns him away too. The affair continues for several months. Eventually Caligula finds out about their affair, and sends Demetrius to get the Robe from the Christians.\n\nDemetrius is taken to a small house, where he is surprised to find Lucia, lying on a bed clutching the Robe. He finds out that she never had died, after all, but that when he prayed for God to save her, her sudden coma had accomplished her rescue. Now, months later, she is still unconscious. Demetrius realizes he has made a mistake, prays to God, and Lucia awakens.\n\nDemetrius takes the Robe to the Emperor, who takes it below to a prisoner. He has the prisoner killed and tries to resurrect him using the Robe. Furious that he cannot, Caligula accuses Demetrius of having brought him a fake, declaring both the Robe and Christ are frauds. Demetrius is horrified to learn that the Emperor had a prisoner killed in order attempt to use the power of the Robe to bring him back to life, and steps toward Caligula to attack him. He is stopped by the guards and on Caligula's orders is sent back to the arena.\n\nWhen the Emperor tries to have Demetrius executed, the Praetorian Guard (already angry at Caligula over worse pay and conditions) finally turns against Caligula and kills first Macro, the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and then Caligula himself. Claudius is installed as Emperor by the Praetorian Guard almost immediately after Caligula is killed.\n\nSoon after his installation, Emperor Claudius says that he is neither a god, nor likely to become one anytime soon. Claudius says that he maintained the appearance of being weak to survive Caligula's rule, and that he would now take on the role of Emperor to the best of his ability. He gives Demetrius his final orders as a Tribune: to go to Peter and the other Christians, and tell them that as long as they do not act against the Empire they have nothing to fear from Claudius. Messalina re-vows her constancy to her husband. Demetrius and Glycon (William Marshall) (another virtuous gladiator) take the Robe to Peter, and the trio leaves the Imperial Palace together.\n\nThe sequel was planned even before \"The Robe\" had been released. It was originally known as \"The Story of Demetrius\". Filming was completed by September 1953. i\n\n\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\" was a massive commercial success. In its initial release, the film earned $4.25 million in US theatrical rentals, against a budget of less than $2 million. Overall, it grossed $26 million in North America, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1954.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"we've got to hand it to Producer Frank Ross and Philip Dunne, the writer who put this one together out of whole cloth instead of 'The Robe' ... they have millinered this saga along straight Cecil B. Devotional lines, which means stitching on equal cuttings of spectacle, action, sex and reverence.\" \"Variety\" called the film \"a worthy successor\" to \"The Robe,\" \"beautifully fashioned with all the basics of good drama and action that can play, and quite often do, against any setting, period or modern.\" Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"As long as Mature is merely bluffing at being a gladiator, and trying at the same time to remain true to the principles of Christianity, the drama of the picture limps along ... Once Mature suddenly goes on a rampage as a fighter in the arena, 'Demetrius' takes on new life. It holds onto that animation most creditably even when its central character reforms.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" stated, \"Because there is less of the religious aspect of its Lloyd C. Douglas predecessor, and much more of the man-versus-lions-versus-men-versus-women-versus-vino of the early Cecil B. DeMille school herein, I suspect that, moviewise at least, 'Demetrius and the Gladiators' is a more enjoyable, less stuffy entertainment.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote, \"Excellent! As a general rule, it is too much to hope that a sequel to an outstanding picture will be as good as the original, but 'Demetrius and the Gladiators,' which is a CinemaScope sequel to 'The Robe,' is one of the rare exceptions to the rule, for it not only matches the spectacular production quality of the original but also surpasses it in entertainment appeal.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"This sequel to \"The Robe\" seems much less inhibited by religious awe than its predecessor. Its spectacle is more lusty; its vulgarity unabashed. Twice it turns back reverently to \"The Robe\" (in flashback) as to a chastening altar, but happily soon regains its own noisy bounce in describing suggestive doings in dirty ancient Rome.\"\n\n"}

The district covers all of the city of Stafford and is controlled by the city, making it the only school district in Texas that is not an independent school district operated by an independent school board.\n\nThere are five schools on the campus of Stafford Municipal School District. The Primary/Elementary School building houses grades Pre-K through 4, the Intermediate School building houses grades 5 through 6, and the Middle/High School building houses grades 7 through 12. The administration building and athletic facilities are on the same campus as the school buildings. As of the beginning of the new 2019-2020 school year, a new building is being built. The purpose of the building is unknown, but some people think that this new building will be a 5-7 grades. The building will also have 3 layers. That would mean that the other schools, for example the intermediate might have another use other than 5-6 grades.\n\nThe Stafford MSD area is served by the Houston Community College System.\n\nIn 2018, the school district was rated an overall B by the Texas Education Agency.\n\nIn 1977, Stafford schools broke away from the Fort Bend Independent School District, which caused several rounds of federal litigation and by 1981 it was finally declared that the Stafford Municipal School District was constitutional. Almost all of Stafford was in the Fort Bend District, with a minuscule portion in the Houston Independent School District. All of Stafford is now zoned to the Stafford Municipal School District, which is the only school district in all of Texas that is controlled by a city.\n\nWhile Stafford MSD is a part of the City of Stafford and took all of the land in the city in 1977 when it was created, Stafford MSD cannot annex any territory without the consent of the other school districts which own that territory. Because of this, the City of Stafford, for a period of over 20 years ending in 2006, did not annex any territory in its extraterritorial jurisdiction as that would mean portions of its territory would fall within these independent school districts: Alief, Ft.

He is best known for playing Vincent Chase in the television series \"Entourage\" (2004–2011). He has appeared in films such as \"Drive Me Crazy\" (1999), \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (2006) and \"Trash Fire\" (2016).\n\nGrenier was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the son of Karesse Grenier and John Dunbar. His parents were never married. He was raised by his mother in New York City. His father was from Ohio, and has English, German, Scottish and Irish ancestry. His mother was born in New Mexico, to a family of mostly Mexican (Indigenous, Spanish) and some French descent.\n\nA DNA test on the series \"Finding Your Roots\" showed Grenier to have approximately 8% Native American ancestry and that his direct matrilineal line is Native American. The program determined that his ancestor Diego de Montoya (born in Texcoco, New Spain, in 1596) was the leader of an \"encomienda\", a protectorate of Puebloan peoples in Pueblo San Pedro in New Mexico. He shares this ancestor with author and commentator Linda Chavez, making them ninth cousins.\n\nGrenier graduated from Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts and attended Bard College in New York.\n\nIn 1997, Grenier left Bard to embark on a film career. He made his film debut in the independent drama, \"Arresting Gena\", then in 1999 played opposite Melissa Joan Hart in \"Drive Me Crazy\" and in 2001 starred in James Toback's \"Harvard Man\".\n\nIn 2004, Grenier played Vincent Chase in the HBO series \"Entourage\", gaining his most substantial notability and success. The series followed the triumphs and trials in the life of Chase, as the movie star character and his friends lived the good life in Los Angeles. It ran for eight seasons, from 2004–2011, and was nominated for numerous Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. In 2006, he played Nate Cooper, the boyfriend of Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) in \"The Devil Wears Prada\".\n\nIn 2013, he starred in the post-apocalyptic film \"Goodbye World\" alongside Gaby Hoffmann. It premiered at the 2013 Los Angeles Film Festival where it received good reviews. The film made its cinematic release in the United States on April 4, 2014.\n\nGrenier stepped back in front of the camera in 2015 to reprise his role of Vincent Chase in the \"Entourage\" film adaptation. Filming began in January 2014 and the film was released in June 2015. He is a campus advisor for Academy for Global Citizenship in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAs a vehicle for Grenier to transition between acting, directing and producing, with some partners, he started Reckless Productions in 2001. The company focused on producing socially minded films. One of its first, \"Shot in the Dark,\" chronicled Grenier's journey to reconnect with his estranged father, Dunbar, with whom his mother broke up when he was still a baby. Grenier and Dunbar remained estranged for 18 years until he began work on the documentary in an attempt to forge a relationship with him. The two eventually reunited and continue to remain in contact. This was Grenier's directorial debut and the film premiered at the 2002 Tribeca Film Festival. HBO distributed the documentary and it premiered on the channel on June 3, 2007.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, Grenier premiered a new television series, \"Alter Eco\", for which he was the producer. The show aired on the Discovery communications channel, Planet Green, and featured Grenier and a team of green experts showing changes that can be made to live a more eco-friendly and sustainable lifestyle.\n\nOn September 27, 2010, HBO premiered \"Teenage Paparazzo\", another documentary directed by Grenier and produced by Bert Marcus. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film focused on 13-year-old paparazzo, Austin Visschedyk, and the celebrity obsessed world in which he operates. It also featured interviews with celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Alec Baldwin, and Whoopi Goldberg. Grenier worked on the documentary for three years as a producer as well. Aside from HBO, \"Teenage Paparazzo\" premiered on 40 other outlets around the globe. In addition to its theatrical release, Grenier took the documentary to College campuses nationwide in the Teenage Paparazzo \"Experience Tour.\" The tour included a call for art to be included in a traveling gallery that challenged the traditional understanding of celebrity and modern media.\n\nIn 2010, Grenier began working as a producer alongside producer Bert Marcus and director Matthew Cooke on the full-length feature documentary, \"How to Make Money Selling Drugs\". The film was a tongue-in-cheek look at what is considered to be one of the worst domestic policy failures in recent American history. It featured actual dealers and even celebrities commenting on the subject including; 50 Cent, Eminem, Susan Sarandon and David Simon, head writer of acclaimed HBO series \"The Wire\". It was released in the summer of 2013 on Amazon.com in addition to iTunes and received positive reviews.\n\nAn advocate of sustainable living, Grenier and his business partner, film producer Peter Glatzer founded the lifestyle brand SHFT.com in 2010. SHFT is a brand which promotes sustainability through film, design, art and culture and lives both online and offline. Its mission is to nudge sustainable ideas and products into pop culture, and to provide context for an inspiring, modern, sustainable way of life.\n\nSHFT has partnered with brands such as; Ford Motor Company, AOL/Huffington Post, Virgin America, Stonyfield Farm, The W Hollywood, The Weather Channel, and Estée Lauder. In its second year, SHFT won two Webby Awards for best website in its category.\n\nIn 2014, Grenier and Glatzer partnered with Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture to create SHFT Mobile Kitchen Classroom – a teaching kitchen on wheels for high-school students in New York City. Through lessons on cooking, science, technology, and sustainability, it is designed to help teenagers understand how the food choices they make relate to broader issues of personal and environmental health.\n\nGrenier plays guitar, bass, drums and harmonica. He was a member of two New York bands: the lead singer in Kid Friendly and the drummer in The Honey Brothers before moving on to build Wreckroom, a music incubator and recording studio in May 2012.\n\nHis intentions were to create a space for friends to write, perform and record music. However, the equipped studio eventually evolved, becoming a breeding ground for fresh talent. Over fifty artists made use for twenty spaces from the basement in Brooklyn. The next year, Grenier started Wreckroom Records and described as \"the manifestation of a boyhood dream.\" Importantly to Grenier, Wreckroom requires that artists participate in the community. As he told Billboard in 2015, \"You don't just come in, take your record and go and promote yourself. You become part of the family.\"\n\nArtists are vetted by Grenier and his team: Damien Paris, Mike Frankel and Brian Koerber. Selected musicians join the team for a full day session, in which they professionally record an original song and film a live-style music video. Wreckroom releases EPs in addition to a video series of cover songs, titled \"Under the Covers\" and two bands, Missouri \"punk 'n' roll\" trio Radkey and metal-spined Brooklyn five-piece The Skins, released EPs on the label in 2013. Wreckroom also hosts curated music showcases in both Brooklyn and Austin, the latest a 3-day takeover of Arlyn Studios in 2016.\n\nThe Skins were one of the first bands to record in the Wreckroom and their talent led Grenier to not only sign the group to Wreckroom but also to agree to manage the band. The group is based in Brooklyn and consists of siblings Bayli, Reef, and Kaya Mckeithan, along with guitarists Daisy Spencer and Russell Chell.\n\nOn World Environment Day 2017, Grenier was appointed as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme. Grenier was chosen due to his work with the Lonely Whale Foundation. https://www.lonelywhale.org/ In his new role, Grenier will advocate for reducing single-use plastic and for the protection of marine species, as well as encourage his followers to make conscious consumer choices to reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nIn 2009, Grenier launched an eco-themed app for the iPhone and Android mobile platforms. The app, called Ecohero, incorporated a barcode-scanning technology to help consumers weigh products' environmental and health impact. Ecohero also contained other functions, such as a carbon calculator and eco-encyclopedia.\n\n"}

He returned for a short spell at Beşiktaş the next season, but received a seven-month suspension for celebrating a goal against arch-rivals Fenerbahçe by putting his hands down his shorts, a gesture he described as \"a private moment of joy\". The Beşiktaş board were forced to cancel his contract as a result. The incident did not diminish his popularity with Beşiktaş fans, who still look back fondly on his lob shot against Dynamo Kiev in the third round of the UEFA Cup in 2003.\n\nFollowing this incident he played in Qatar and went on trial at clubs in countries like the USA and Scotland.\n\nNouma works as an actor, and made his film debut in a Turkish movie, \"Dünyayı Kurtaran Adamın Oğlu\" (\"The Son of the Man Who Saved the World\").\n\nHe also does a morning radio show at \"Metro FM (Turkey)\".\n\nHe is particularly famous for his eccentric behaviour both on and off the pitch.

{"id": "2017016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017016", "title": "Tyler (Masonic)", "text": "Tyler (Masonic)\n\nTyler (or Tiler) is the name of the office of \"outer guard\" of a Masonic Lodge. Masonic lodges may meet in rooms in taverns and other public meeting places, and all Lodges appoint a Tyler to guard the door from the outside against ineligible masons or malicious or curious people, to check the eligibility of latecomers, and to ensure that candidates for ceremonies in the Lodge are properly prepared. Although a junior Officer of the Lodge and often a highly experienced Past Master, he may often be considered akin to a sergeant: in some cases the Tyler may not be an unpaid member of the lodge, but a mason from another lodge employed for the purpose. Other duties often involve preparing the room for meetings, supplying regalia and equipment, serving as bar steward or acting as permanent, and sometimes resident, caretaker of the furniture and premises.\n\nIn some Jurisdictions the Tyler is appointed by the Worshipful Master, while in others he is elected by the members of the Lodge. He is charged with examining the Masonic credentials of anyone wishing to enter the Lodge and keeping unqualified persons from infiltrating Masonic meetings, and admitting only those qualified to attend the current business.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the Tyler is required to be outside the Lodge door for large portions of the meeting, although usually in a position to overhear the proceedings. The position has often been given to a deserving Mason who has fallen on hard times, such as the original Grand Master Anthony Sayer, or to a senior Lodge member who can help and advise those kept waiting outside.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the Worshipful Master has the authority to permit or direct the Tyler to \"tyle from within\" during the non-ritualistic portions of a meeting. If tyling from within, the Tyler must first secure the outer doors of the Tyler's anteroom. He would then leave the inner door open between the lodge room and the Tyler's anteroom, and sit at the seat closest to the door, still holding his drawn sword. Tyling from within enables the Tyler to participate in the business portions of the meeting, voice his opinions, volunteer for committees, deliver reports, and receive instruction if any be given. In other jurisdictions, such as the United Grand Lodge of England, the Tyler is always expected to be outside the closed door of the lodge; on the rare occasions when the Tyler enters the lodge room, another lodge member (typically the Inner Guard or, in the U.S., the Junior Deacon) goes outside to take temporary responsibility for guarding the door.\n\nThe origins of the term are uncertain and a number of hypotheses have been presented over time. Masonic lodges originally met in inns or taverns, and Tyler is an Old English word for the keeper of an inn door. Alternatively, the name may simply come from the occupation of tyler—a person who lays roof and floor tiles. More fanciful suggestions have included:\n\n\nWilliam Hogarth's famous print of \"Night\" shows a drunken Mason being helped home by the Tyler, from one of the four original Lodges in 1717 at the Rummer & Grapes tavern.\n\n"}

The area that was opened to settlement included all or part of the Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of the US state of Oklahoma. The land run started at high noon on April 22, 1889, with an estimated 50,000 people lined up for their piece of the available two million acres (8,000 km).\n\nThe Unassigned Lands were considered some of the best unoccupied public land in the United States. The Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 was passed and signed into law with an amendment by Illinois Representative William McKendree Springer that authorized President Benjamin Harrison to open the two million acres (8,000 km²) for settlement. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act of 1862 which allowed settlers to claim lots of up to , provided that they lived on the land and improved it.\n\nThe removal of Native Americans to Indian Territory started after the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828. The federal government was unwilling to help the tribes in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi fight against state laws passed against them. President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830.\n\nThe Choctaws were the first tribe to concede to removal in 1830. They agreed to give up their land and move to the designated Indian Territory. The main portions of the Choctaw tribe moved to Indian Territory from 1830-1833, with the promise that they would be granted autonomy. Many perished on the journey to the new territory.\n\nThe Creeks were the next tribe to move to Indian Territory. In 1829 a council was held and it was agreed that they would submit to state laws and stay on their lands. However, pressure from settlers and the state government lead to the Creek Tribe surrendering its lands to the state of Alabama. By 1836, the entire Creek Tribe had been removed to Oklahoma after the killing and pillaging of white settlers and a civil war within the tribe.\n\nThe Cherokees were the third tribe to be removed to Indian Territory. Tribal leaders Chief John Ross, and other high ranking families did the most they could to keep their lands. Jackson actively refused to enforce the ruling in the Worcester v. Georgia case, ruling that the Cherokee Nation was a community that had its own boundaries and the citizens of Georgia could not enter their lands without consent of the Cherokee Tribe. The necessity to leave Georgia to Oklahoma became inevitable to Chief John Ross. Eventually the U.S. military came and forced the removal of the Cherokees to Indian Territory. By the end of 1838, the Cherokee tribe had been fully removed to Oklahoma. Out of the 18,000 that made the trip from 1835 to 1838, about 4,000 perished.\n\nThe Chickasaws elected to leave their lands freely and did not suffer like the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was progressing by frontier standards in that they were educating children, building churches, and farming. They were faced with the problem of the federal government not being able to protect them from the state government of Mississippi. Beginning in 1832 a collection of treaties were signed, granting them better terms than the other tribes had received. They left for Oklahoma in the winter of 1837–38 and paid the Choctaws to be able to settle on their lands.\n\nThe Seminole Tribe was tricked into signing a removal treaty and the Seminole War is what followed. This was the bloodiest and costliest Indian war in United States history. Chief Osceola and his tribe hid in the Everglades in Florida, and the military sought to hunt them down. Many were captured and sent to Oklahoma in chains. Osceola surrendered and died in prison. The war and removal reduced their population by 40%, and only 2,254 were left in 1859 according to the 1859 census.\n\nAfter the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes, they were later joined by tribes of the plains who were forced into the territory after wars with the U.S. military. The Quapaws and Senecas were placed in Northeast Oklahoma with the Cherokees. They were later joined by the Shawnees, Delawares, and Kickapoos by 1845. After the entrance of Texas into the Union, the Caddos, Kiowas, and parts of the Comanche tribe were placed in Indian Territory after treaties with the Civilized Tribes. By 1880, the Wyandots, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Wichitas, and other smaller tribes had been removed from surrounding states and placed into Oklahoma.\n\nAmericans at this time were facing the troubles of land overpopulation in the east where millions of people were occupying only thousands of square miles of land. The Civil War had also just ended, sparking people's need to occupy the west. The only problem was the Indian Territory was not open to settlers at this crucial time. Americans called for their legislators to open the Indian Territory and certain Native Americans like Elias C. Boudinot encouraged other Native Americans to participate in the effort to welcome westward expansion. As a result, thirty-three bills were presented before congress introducing legislation to open the territory for settlement in the course of ten years from 1870 to 1879.\n\nLegislation was passed through Congress in 1866 that permitted railroads to be laid in sections of on either sides of the Indian Territory. The two companies in charge of creating these railroads were the Atlantic and the Pacific, although their contracts were eventually rescinded due to not finishing the projects in the agreed time. Railroad companies that came up after them took it as their responsibility to finish the project, and saw a way to strengthen their contracts by introducing the movement of white settlement in the Indian Territory. The Railroads employed people like C. C. Carpenter to spread false information in newspapers of the Indian Territory being open to settlement through Congress's Homestead laws. The articles were a success as a large movement of black and white settlers began to move to the Oklahoma Territory. The President of that time, Rutherford B. Hayes, issued warnings to the boomers to not move into the Indian land, and issued commands to the military to use force to ensure this.\n\nA number of the people who participated in the run entered the unoccupied land early and hid there until the legal time of entry to lay quick claim to some of the most choice homesteads. These people came to be identified as \"Sooners\". This led to hundreds of legal contests that arose and were decided first at local land offices and eventually by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Arguments included what constituted the \"legal time of entry\". While some people think that the settlers who entered the territory at the legally appointed time were known as \"boomers\", the term actually refers to those who campaigned for the opening of the lands, led by David L. Payne.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma's fight song, \"Boomer Sooner\", derives from these two names.\nCaptain David L. Payne grabbed hold of this booming movement to occupy and create the Oklahoma Territory. He and other enthusiasts created the Oklahoma Colony, allowing settlers to join with the fee of a minimum of one dollar. Then once settled in the Oklahoma Territory they organized themselves as a town-site company that sold lots of land from a range of $2–25 depending on the demand of the Boomer Movement. Cattlemen, afraid that these boomers would take their land, worked to keep them out alongside the military. Settlers thought it their right to occupy the lands as they had purchased it with cash and by doing so, their title was invested in the U.S. government. Even so, the military was at constant work to arrest the boomers unlawfully on Indian Territory, although they were generally released without having to go on trial.\n\nOn November 28, 1884, Captain David L. Payne met his end at a hotel in Kansas due to poison found in his glass of milk. It is speculated that it was organized by cattlemen unhappy with the success of the Boomer Movement.\n\nWilliam Couch was a former lieutenant under Payne. He did not possess the brash personality of his predecessor, however, he had a kindred personality and spoke with strength. He rigorously studied all treaties, court cases, and laws regarding the Oklahoma land issue in order to present logical and concise boomer claims. He had led unsuccessful movements into Indian Territory, but under military and legal pressure the Oklahoma movement stagnated. It was rebooted with the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad line across the middle of Indian Territory from Arkansas City, Kansas to Gainesville, Texas. Certain that the lands would be opened to settlement shortly after the construction of the railroad was completed in the spring of 1887, the Oklahoma movement again slowed down.\n\nBy December 1887 the inaction of Congress reignited the movement behind the leadership of William Couch. After a conference of boomers was held in Kansas, the conference sent delegates Sydney Clarke, Samuel Crocker, and William Couch to Washington to promote the passage of an act to open Oklahoma lands for settlement. After Couch and company presented the bill to Congress, it faced opposition from state representatives George T. Barnes of Georgia, Charles E. Hooker of Mississippi, and Colonel G.W. Hawkins of the Chickasaw Nation. They opposed it based on the premise that the U.S. government had promised the land to the Indian Nations living there and the government did not have the right to open up land in the territory to settlement.\n\nThe Springer Oklahoma Bill, which was proposed by Illinois representative William M. Springer, was meant to use the Homestead Act to open the lands for settlement. Arguments over the payment for the lands went up until the legislative session ended and the bill was not passed. In December, Couch presented the Springer Oklahoma Bill to Congress again, which led to the passage of the Indian Appropriation Bill. With this bill, Congress paid $1,912,952.02 to the Seminole and Creek Nations in exchange for 2,370,414.62 acres of unassigned land. A section giving the president the authority to open the land to white settlement was added.\n\nAfrican Americans had been trying to find communities they could settle without the worries of racism against them. During the time that the Land Rush took place, black families were building their own way of life and culture since the Reconstruction era. Even in the Oklahoma Territory, the five main Native American Tribes had to sign agreements with the US government that they would no longer practice slavery, and if they continued, they would be exempted from their land by the United States.\n\nDuring the Land Rush, it was a growing belief within the African American community that this opening of free land was their opportunity to create communities of their very own, without the influence of racism. Their intentions were to make Oklahoma a state just for them. One organization that took advantage of this movement was the Oklahoma Immigration Organization owned by W. L. Eagleson. Eagleson spread the announcement of recolonization to the black community throughout the United States, especially focused in the South.One attempt to make Oklahoma a black state was to appoint Edward Preston McCabe as the Governor of the Oklahoma Territory. This would make it easier for black families to settle within the region during the land rush. This plan fell through the cracks, as there seemed to be less and less excitement of immigrating to the new land, and instead McCabe had to settle to being a treasurer in Logan County of Oklahoma.\n\nThe attempts of people like Eagleson and McCabe were not completely futile as their support of the black family did enthuse many to continue to move to the Oklahoma Territory. These movements did become townships, such as Kingfisher.\n\nAfter the passage of the Indian Appropriation Bill, President Benjamin Harrison made the declaration that on April 22, 1889, at 12 o'clock noon that the Unassigned Land in Indian Territory would be open for settlement. At the time of the opening, which was indicated by gunshot, and the line of people on horse and in wagons dispersed into a kaleidoscope of motion and dust and oxen and wagons. The chase for land was frenzied and much chaos and disorder ensued. The rush did not last long, and by the end of the day nearly two million acres of land had been claimed. By the end of the year, 62,000 settlers lived in the Unassigned Lands located between the Five Tribes on the east and the Plains Tribes on the west.\n\nBy the end of the day (April 22, 1889), both Oklahoma City and Guthrie had established cities of around 10,000 people in literally half a day. As \"Harper's Weekly\" put it:\nAt twelve o'clock on Monday, April 22d, the resident population of Guthrie was nothing; before sundown it was at least ten thousand. In that time streets had been laid out, town lots staked off, and steps taken toward the formation of a municipal government. \nMany settlers immediately started improving their new land or stood in line waiting to file their claim. Many children sold creek water to homesteaders waiting in line for five cents a cup, while other children gathered buffalo dung to provide fuel for cooking. By the second week, schools had opened and were being taught by volunteers paid by pupils' parents until regular school districts could be established. Within one month, Oklahoma City had five banks and six newspapers.\n\nOn May 2, 1890, the Oklahoma Organic Act was passed creating the Oklahoma Territory. This act included the Panhandle of Oklahoma within the territory. It also allowed for central governments and designated Guthrie as the territory's capital.\n\nWith the signal of troops to cross into the territory, over a dozen Santa Fe trains pulled into Oklahoma Territory, and most others traveled by other means—on horseback, in wagons, and on foot. Establishing a claim involved placing a stake with the claimant's name and place of entry at a U.S. land, one of which was located in Guthrie and the other in Kingfisher. The settler had to live on the claimed section of land for a five-year period before they could attain the title to the property. That period could be shortened to fourteen months if the settler paid a price of $1.25 per acre.\n\nGuthrie, Oklahoma City, Kingfisher, El Reno, Norman, and Stillwater were six of the townsites established in 1889 and they were given county seats. Guthrie was named capital of the Territory and later was capital of the state of Oklahoma for a brief period. Oklahoma City then became the permanent capital of the state. On April 23, Oklahoma City contained more than 12,000 people. Within an hour of land being opened, 2,500 settlers occupied lands in their township that they initially named Lisbon, but would later be called Kingfisher.\n\n\n\n"}

Copeland\n\nRoyal Samuel Copeland (November 7, 1868June 17, 1938), a United States Senator from New York from 1923 until 1938, was an academic, homeopathic physician, and politician. He held elected offices in both Michigan (as a Republican) and New York (as a Democrat).\n\nBorn in Dexter, Michigan, to parents Roscoe P. Copeland and Frances J. Holmes, Royal Copeland graduated from Dexter High School and attended Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University). In 1888, he taught school in Sylvan Township, Michigan.\n\nHe graduated in 1889 from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor with a degree in medicine. After graduate studies in Europe, Copeland practiced medicine in Bay City, Michigan, from 1890 to 1895. Copeland was admitted to the Homeopathy Society of Michigan on May 21, 1890, and was made secretary of the society in October 1893. He was a professor of Ophthalmology and Otology in the University of Michigan Medical School's Homeopathic Department from 1895 until 1908.\n\nDuring his time as a medical professor in Ann Arbor, Copeland was active in municipal politics. A Republican, he served as mayor of Ann Arbor from 1901 to 1903. He was president of the Ann Arbor Board of Education from 1907 to 1908. He also served for several years as president of the Ann Arbor Board of Park Commissioners.\n\nOn July 15, 1908, Copeland married Frances Spalding. The same year, Copeland moved to New York City to take a position as dean at the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital, a position he left in 1918 to serve as President of the New York City Board of Health. He gained much positive public attention for keeping New York City residents calm during the influenza outbreak of 1918.\n\nIn 1922, Copeland ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate, defeating first-term Republican Senator William M. Calder. Franklin D. Roosevelt served as his honorary campaign manager for this election. Copeland was re-elected in 1928 over Republican challenger Alanson B. Houghton, the U.S. Ambassador to Britain and a former U.S. Representative. Copeland was again re-elected in 1934, this time defeating future U.S. Congressman E. Harold Cluett.\n\nDuring his three terms in the Senate, Copeland served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration from 1933 to 1936 and chairman of the Committee on Commerce from 1935 to 1938. In 1935-1936 Copeland served as Chairman of the highly controversial Copeland Committee, which gave a scathing review of air traffic safety and the operation of the Bureau of Air Commerce. Copeland served as primary author and sponsor of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 which entrenched special protections for pseudoscientific homeopaths. He was the primary sponsor of the Copeland \"Anti-kickback\" Act, which targeted kickbacks to federal contractors, subcontractors and officials from construction employees.\n\nCopeland was close to the regular Democratic organization in New York, the boss-led Tammany Hall. He was a conservative Democrat and not especially supportive of the New Deal policies of his fellow New Yorker, Franklin Roosevelt. He was also a friend of Harry S. Truman when they both served in the U.S. Senate. Copeland was known for his successful efforts to bring air conditioning to the Senate.\n\nIn 1937 he lost the Democratic nomination for Mayor of New York City to Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney, and the Republican nomination to incumbent Republican Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia.\n\nCopeland died at his apartment in Washington, DC on June 17, 1938. According to news reports, he died of a circulatory collapse brought on by overwork during the longer than usual Senate session that ended on the day of his death.

The inaugural committee had seven members representing the four schools. The purpose of the HKFS is to promote student movements and to enhance the student body's engagement in society. Since the 1990s, the federation has taken an interest in daily events in Hong Kong, and no longer restricts itself to the areas of education and politics.\nThe HKFS council (代表會) is convened by representatives of the university student unions. The representatives are elected by the university students. A standing committee is appointed by the council.\n\nIn 1971, the Senkaku Islands dispute arose. The administration of the Senkaku/Diaoyutai Islands was transferred from the United States to Japan. On 14 February 1971, Hong Kong students established the Hong Kong Action Committee in Defence of the Diaoyutai Islands (香港保衛釣魚台行動委員會). The Action Committee held demonstrations in front of the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong. Twenty-one people were arrested, seven of whom were university students. On 17 April, the Hong Kong University Students' Union held a peaceful demonstration involving about 1000 students. On 7 July, the HKFS held a demonstration on a larger scale. In 1971, the HKFS was an illegal organisation and some students were arrested by the Royal Hong Kong Police. On 13 May 1975, the federation held its last protest over the issue.\n\nDuring 1975 and 1976, the standing committee of the HKFS voiced its support for the Cultural Revolution in mainland China. The committee criticised Mak Chung Man, who led students to protest against the communists and said he was \"against all the Chinese\". Students resented this statement and the issue became the main topic of debate during the HKFS elections of 1976.\n\nIn April 1977, the Hong Kong University Students' Union suggested the removal of the words \"anti-right wing\" from the action guide of the HKFS but the standing committee refused to vote. All delegates from the Hong Kong University Students' Union withdrew from the HKFS in protest.\n\nIn April 1979, the HKFS commemorated the May Fourth Movement. The event was poorly attended.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the HKFS began to support democracy in Taiwan and mainland China. In 1981, the \"Hong Kong Standard\" revealed that the HKFS had been placed on a \"Red List\" in a classified Standing Committee on Pressure Groups (SCOPG) report for being \"pro-communist\". In March 1983, the HKFS reported the Shue Yan College to the Hong Kong Independent Commission against Corruption but no prosecution was launched. After 1984, the HKFS changed from supporting communism to fully supporting democratic development.\n\nIn February 1989, about 4000 students boycotted their classes to protest against the policy of the Hong Kong Education Department. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the HKFS took part in China-wide demonstrations and strikes. On 20 May, when the tropical cyclone signal number 8 was hoisted, thousands of students took part in a massive demonstration. After the 4 June massacre, all of the HKFS represented university students stopped attending classes. In 1991, there were protests (said by police to be illegal) to support the dissident, Wang Dan.\n\nIn 2003, 2004 and 2005, the HKFS took an active part in the 1 July marches.\n\nIn 2014, the HKFS, led by Alex Chow and Lester Shum, was a participating organisation in the Umbrella Movement. The movement demanded genuine democracy in future chief executive elections. Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok were occupied by suffragists for two months.\n\nSome democratic activists criticised the HKFS for failing to lead the movement. In early 2015, five of the member organisations held disaffiliation referenda. Four passed, reducing the number of member organisations from eight to four. The results are as follows:\n\nAmidst this push for localism in Hong Kong, the HKFS was, for the first time, absent from the Victoria Park candlelight vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.\n\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Students is formed by the student unions of four institutions:\n\nFormer members were:\n\n"}

It is the first installment of the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" film series and consists of two parts, \"Evangelion: Death\" and \"Evangelion: Rebirth\". It was released, along with the follow-up, \"The End of Evangelion\", in response to the success of the TV series and a strong demand by fans for another ending. It has since been re-edited and re-released several times.\n\nThis first part, \"Evangelion: Death\", is a 're-cap' editing together scenes from the first 24 episodes of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" in the form of a clip show, along with additional animation created after the show's original broadcast. This includes scenes from the original show re-drawn shot-for-shot, entirely new shots augmenting existing sequences, and linking segments based around the premise of the four main characters playing Pachelbel's Canon as a string quartet. Some of the additional shots and re-drawn animation would later be re-edited into the new extended cuts of Episodes 21-24 included on the Japanese Laserdisc and American and European \"Platinum Collection\" releases of the TV series, commonly known as the \"Director's Cut\" versions in the West. The part ends with credits accompanied by a double string quartet arrangement of Pachelbel's Canon.\n\nThe second part, \"Evangelion: Rebirth\", consists of approximately 24 minutes of entirely new animation that would eventually form the first third of the film \"The End of Evangelion\", released four months later. Serving as a preview while the film was still in production, \"Rebirth\" only covers the initial preparations of the Human Instrumentality Project and the invasion of the Geofront by the JSSDF, ending with the arrival of the Mass Production Evas. Because of its unfinished state, there are differences between \"Rebirth\" and the portion it covers of the finished \"Episode 25\"' that makes up the first half of \"The End Of Evangelion\". These differences include editing, shots that were later re-drawn entirely, and soundtrack cues that were replaced or further edited. The part ends with credits accompanied by the song Tamashii No Refrain by Yoko Takahashi.\n\n\"Death and Rebirth\" was co-produced by Kadokawa Shoten, Gainax, TV Tokyo, Sega, and Toei Company.\n\nBetween March and October 1997, \"Death and Rebirth\" grossed .

One notable change was the alteration of the sound effect between the scene featuring Kaji to one of Shinji informing Asuka of his death. According to the DVD commentary, English ADR director Amanda Winn-Lee, also the voice of Rei in the dub, felt the sound was not a proper \"gunshot\" and replaced it with a more overt effect. However, the Japanese screenplay mentions that the sound effect is not a gunshot at all, but rather the sound of a slap (the following scene implies Asuka has slapped Shinji's face).\n\nEvangelion: Death(True) screened on January 2, 1998 on the Japanese satellite TV channel WOWOW; this version of \"Evangelion: Death\" was personally re-edited by Masayuki, removing some of the extra footage new to the feature. This was released on home video for the first time as part of the \"Archives of Evangelion\" DVD box set in 2015.\nAnother theatrical presentation titled Revival of Evangelion was released on March 8, 1998, consisting of Death(True) (a further edit of \"Death(True)\", with a few removed shots edited back in) followed by a 4 minute intermission and then the finished \"The End of Evangelion\". \"Revival\" and \"End\" were released on the ninth and tenth discs of the \"Renewal of Evangelion\" box set with the latter titled \"Evangelion – The Feature Film\". \"Revival of Evangelion\" and the original theatrical cut of \"Death and Rebirth\" were both released on Blu-Ray alongside other materials as part of the 2015 \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" box set. \"Death(True)\" is also the version most widely released in the west, having been opted by Netflix for its distribution service.\n\nChris Beveridge from \"Mania\" gave it an overall \"A−\" score.

Overall, the collection contains 20 statues of Hercules, about 30 of Venus, and 100 of the Caesars and their families, among them a bust of Julius Caesar. Besides, it includes sculptures of the gods from Roman mythology and Roman copies of Greek statues.\n\nAccording to the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the namesake of the collection and then the museum, the Roman Torlonia family, received ownership of the collection around 1800 or in the early 19th century. The previous owners, the Giustiniani family, had taken out a loan from the Torlonia dynasty and secured it with the collection, but then defaulted on paying back the loan. (According to earlier information by the same newspaper, however, Prince Giovanni Torlonia himself was the founder of the collection when, in 1810, \"he bought some works and unearthed others on his land in Portus\".)\n\nAlessandro Torlonia, heir to Giovanni, opened the collection to visitors in their family palace on Via della Lungara, close to the Tiber River, in 1893. In the 1960s, the museum was dismantled and the 77-room palace was converted into a 93-unit apartment building. The collection was put into storage and has not been publicly displayed. In May 2005 the government attempted to buy the collection for 1.2 billion but the offer has been declined.\n\n"}

It belongs to the National Trust and is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe house was built by Stephen Proctor between 1598 and 1604, partly with stone from the abbey ruins. It is an example of a late Elizabethan prodigy house, perhaps influenced by the work of Robert Smythson. After Proctor's death in 1619, Fountains Hall passed into the possession of the Messenger family, who sold it to William Aislabie of neighbouring Studley Royal 150 years later. Fountains Hall became redundant as the Aislabie family remained at Studley Royal. It was leased to tenants and at one time parts of it were used for farm storage.\n\nThe hall was renovated and modernised between 1928 and 1931, and the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) often stayed there as guests of Lady Doris Vyner, sister to the then-current Duke of Richmond and Gordon.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Fountains Hall and other estate buildings were used to house evacuees. Studley Royal became the wartime home of Queen Ethelburga's School from Harrogate and the school's \nsanatorium was at Fountains Hall. The stable block and courtyard was used for dormitories while one corner became the school chapel, at which Sunday Evensong was regularly said by the Archdeacon of Ripon. \nThe hall has a balcony although it cannot be used because the staircase is considered unsafe for the public.\n\nThe Vyners lost a son and a daughter in the Second World War; Charles was a Royal Naval Reserve pilot missing in action near Rangoon. Elizabeth was a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service and died of lethargic encephalitis while on service in Felixstowe, Suffolk. There is a sculpture remembering them which can be seen as one comes out of the house down the stone steps.\n\nWHEN YOU GO HOME\nTELL THEM OF US\nAND SAY\nFOR YOUR TOMORROW\nWE GAVE OUR TODAY\nFROM THIS THEIR HOME, THEY WENT FORTH TO WAR.\nElizabeth Vyner WRNS - Died on Active Service June 3rd 1942 Aged 18 years. Also her brother Charles De Grey Vyner Sub Lieut (A) RNVR Reported missing from Air Operations Off Rangoon May 2nd 1945 Aged 19 Years.\n\nAfter the war the hall again fell into a state of dilapidation. \n\nThe National Trust acquired the Fountains Estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983 and has restored the hall. Part of it has been divided into flats, one of which is a holiday lets. Visitors to Fountains Abbey can view the oak-panelled stone hall and an adjoining exhibition room, and there are plans to restore the chapel.\n\nThe Hall has several reported hauntings. Years ago, when the best route into the main area of Fountains Hall was through a side entrance, visitors would report the sensation of an invisible figure running at them as they walked along the corridor and brushing past them as they walked through to the main part of the house. The Great Hall at Fountains Hall has the sound of musicians rehearsing a piece of music - the sound of a spinet and wind instruments are heard through the walls together with a woman's voice going through the same musical phrase several times and indistinctly, yet as soon as the door to the Great Hall is opened the music stops. \n\nThe bedroom adjoining a former staff flat on the first floor is haunted by a \"shining golden lady\" in eighteenth century dress. A former resident of the Hall during its time as staff accommodation commented that this apparition would appear to children living there at that time when they were sick in bed - she would come and sit beside them and stroke their hair. Previous occupants of the same rooms on the first floor have also reported the ghost of a dog and another apparition of a dark figure carrying a lighted candle. \n\nThe main staircase at the back of the Hall is haunted by the sound of two children at play - their voices are heard and the sound of them moving up and down the staircase, with the sound of rainfall in the background even if the weather outside is sunny.\n\nFountains Hall was the location used for the outdoor shots of Baddesley Clinton for the 1603 raid in the first episode of the 2017 BBC One miniseries \"Gunpowder\" about events surrounding the Gunpowder Plot.\n\nSome exterior shots for the 1993 film adaptation of \"The Secret Garden\" were filmed here.\n\n"}
{"id": "2017098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017098", "title": "A Thousand Plateaus", "text": "A Thousand Plateaus\n\nA Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia () is a 1980 book by the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the French psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\". While the first volume, \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), sought to \"short-circuit\" a developing \"bureaucracy of analytic reason\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), this book was intended to be a \"positive exercise\" in nomadology and rhizomatic philosophy - philosophy with utility that freely moves between addressed subject matters.\n\nThe book has been considered to be a major statement of post-structuralism and postmodernism, especially starting in the late 20th century. Brian Massumi's English translation was published in 1987, a year after the twelfth \"plateau\" was published separately in English as \"Nomadology: The War Machine\" (New York: Semiotext[e], 1986).\n\nLike the first volume, \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972), \"A Thousand Plateaus\", as the second volume of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\", is politically and terminologically provocative, but focuses more so on systematic, environmental and spatial philosophy. A \"plateau\", borrowed from ideas in Gregory Bateson's research on Balinese culture, is \"a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities\". Deleuze and Guattari discuss concepts such as the rhizome, performativity in language, smooth and striated space, the state as State-space representation|systematic variables and as the capitalist and centralized apparatus, face and \"faciality\", the body without organs, minority languages and literature, binary branching structures in language, deterritorialization and reterritorialization, arborescence, pragmatics, lines of flight, assemblages, events of \"becoming\", strata, stratification and destratification, the war machine, the signified, signifier and sign, abstract machines, and coding/recoding.\n\nThe book is written in a non-linear, allusive fashion. The reader is explicitly warned not to set down roots and read \"A Thousand Plateaus\" in order, but to choose a new \"plateau\" or page and begin again \"from ground zero\" at each plateau, as long as they read the introduction first and the conclusion last.\n\nIn \"plateaux\" (chapters) of the book, they discuss psychoanalysts (Freud, Jung, Lacan—who trained Guattari, and Melanie Klein), composers (Chopin, Debussy, Mozart, Pierre Boulez, and Olivier Messiaen), artists (Klee, Kandinsky, and Pollock), philosophers (Husserl, Foucault, Bergson, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Gilbert Simondon), historians (Ibn Khaldun, Georges Dumézil, and Fernand Braudel), and linguists (Chomsky, Labov, Benveniste, Guillaume, Austin, Hjelmslev, and Voloshinov).\n\nThe book starts with an introduction titled \"Rhizome\" that explains rhizomatic philosophy (addressing not just the book itself but all books as rhizomes), and ends with a conclusion, \"Concrete Rules and Abstract Machines\", that makes the abstract/concrete binary clear. In between are thirteen chapters or \"plateaux\", each dated non-linearly, sometimes precisely (\"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics), sometimes less so (\"10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals\"). In the sixth chapter, \"Year Zero: Faciality\" (\"visagéité\"), the notion of face is discussed as an \"overcoding\" of body, but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (\"paysagéité\").\n\nIn the same mode as \"Anti-Oedipus\", Deleuze and Guattari evaluate and criticize psychoanalysis: in the first plateau, they discuss the work of Sigmund Freud, especially referring to the case histories of the Wolf Man and Little Hans.\n\nOwing to their mode of literary theory, \"A Thousand Plateaus\" also frequently discusses literature. In \"1874: Three Novellas\", they discuss Henry James' \"In the Cage\" (1898) and \"The Story of the Abyss and the Spyglass\" by Pierrette Fleutiaux, but they also evoke F. Scott Fitzgerald's essay \"The Crack-Up\" (1945) (which Deleuze previously discussed in \"The Logic of Sense\"), because as a famous novelist, his depression and frustration in the essay is dramatized. The works of Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Henry Miller, D. H. Lawrence, Carlos Castaneda, H. P. Lovecraft, Herman Melville and Chrétien de Troyes are also discussed.\n\n\"A Thousand Plateaus\" is considered a major statement of post-structuralism and postmodernism. Mark Poster writes that the work \"contains promising elaborations of a postmodern theory of the social and political.\" Writing in the foreword to his translation, Massumi comments that the work \"is less a critique than a positive exercise in the affirmative 'nomad' thought called for in \"Anti-Oedipus\".\" Massumi contrasts \"nomad thought\" with the \"state philosophy... that has characterized Western metaphysics since Plato\".\n\nDeleuze critic Eugene Holland suggests that the work complicates the slogans and oppositions developed in its predecessor. Whereas \"Anti-Oedipus\" created binaries such as molar/molecular, paranoid/schizophrenic, and deterritorialization/reterritorialization, \"A Thousand Plateaus\" shows how such distinctions are operations on the surface of a deeper field with more complicated and multidimensional dynamics. In so doing, the book is less engaged with history than with topics like biology and geology. Massumi writes that \"A Thousand Plateaus\" differs drastically in tone, content, and composition from \"Anti-Oedipus\". In his view, the schizoanalysis the authors practice is not so much a study of their \"pathological condition\", but a \"positive process\" that involves \"inventive connection\".\n\nBill Readings appropriates the term \"singularity\" from \"A Thousand Plateaus\", \"to indicate that there is no longer a subject-position available to function as the site of the conscious synthesis of sense-impressions.\" The sociologist Nikolas Rose writes that Deleuze and Guattari articulate \"the most radical alternative to the conventional image of subjectivity as coherent, enduring, and individualized\".\n\nIn 1997, the physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont asserted that the book contains many passages in which Deleuze and Guattari use \"pseudo-scientific language\". Writing about this \"science wars critique,\" Daniel Smith and John Protevi contend that \"much of their chapter on Deleuze consists of exasperated exclamations of incomprehension.\" Similarly, in a 2015 interview, British philosopher Roger Scruton characterized \"A Thousand Plateaus\" as \"[a] huge, totally unreadable tome by somebody who can’t write French.\" At the beginning of a short essay on postmodernism, Jean-François Lyotard lists examples of what he describes as a desire \"to put an end to experimentation\", including a displeased reaction to \"A Thousand Plateaus\" that he had read in a weekly literary magazine, which said that readers of philosophy \"expect [...] to be \"gratified with a little sense\". Behind this \"slackening\" desire to constrain language use, Lyotard identifies a \"desire for a return to terror.\"\n\nDigital media theorist Janet Murray links the work to the aesthetic of hypertext.\n\nGaming and electronic literature expert Espen Aarseth draws parallels between Deleuze and Guattari's idea of the rhizome and semiotician Umberto Eco's idea of the net.\n\nChristopher Miller criticizes Deleuze and Guattari's use of \"second-hand\" anthropological sources without providing the reader with contextualization of the colonialist \"mission\" that led to their writing. Timothy Laurie says that this claim is inaccurate, but that Deleuze & Guattari should extend that same \"rigor\" to uncovering the political and economic entanglements which contextualize academic philosophy.\n\n\"A Thousand Plateaus\" was an influence on the political philosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's book \"Empire\" (2000).\n\nThe sociologist John Urry sees Deleuze and Guattari's metaphor of the nomad as having \"infected contemporary social thought.\"\nThe philosopher Manuel DeLanda, in \"A New Philosophy of Society\" (2006), adopts Deleuze's theory of assemblages, taken from \"A Thousand Plateaus\".\n\n\n"}

It is the first instalment in the \"Molly Moon\" six-book series. Amber Entertainment and Lipsync Productions produced a film adaptation, \"Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism\", which was released on April 11, 2015.\n\nMolly Moon, an orphan at Hardwick House Orphanage in Briersville, England, is living a \"boring and plain\" life with her best friend Rocky Scarlet, another orphan. She is described as being plain looking with a large \"potato\" nose, wobbly knees and green eyes. She is usually beaten down upon by Ms. Adderstone, the woman in charge of the orphanage, and Hazel, a snobby orphan girl. During school, Molly and Rocky have a fight and Molly storms away to the town library. As she walks in, she finds a man yelling at the librarian about a book he ordered, but ignores him. While looking in a curious compartment of the restricted section, she finds a book on hypnotism, placed in the wrong section because the \"H\" was ripped off the spine. Intrigued, she steals it and sneaks out of the library. She takes it to the orphanage to read it.\n\nShe fakes being ill so that she can study the book better. Curiously, she finds that chapters 7 and 8 (\"Voice-Only Hypnosis\" and \"Long Distance Hypnosis\") are missing. Not long after her discovery of the book, she learns that Rocky has been adopted and taken to America with his new family. Determined to see her friend again, she gains the actual ability to hypnotize from the lessons in her book, first successfully hypnotizing the orphanage dog, Petula. Later on, she is able to hypnotize both Ms. Adderstone and their orphanage chef Edna. Using her ability, Molly wins a large sum of money from a local talent competition, by hypnotizing the crowd into believing that she is a talented singer and dancer. She uses the money to fly to New York City, taking Petula with her. Before leaving, she buys a large gold pendulum, where the mysterious professor from the library learns about her, after he bought some anti-hypnosis glasses. She also hypnotizes Ms. Adderstone and Edna to be nice to all children.\n\nSoon after arriving, Molly hypnotizes her way onto Broadway, landing the lead role in a musical called \"Stars on Mars\". However, she steals this part from a real child star, named Davina Nuttel, in the process. The show is a roaring success, and catches the attention of a man named Simon Nockman, who has passed himself off as a \"professor\" of hypnosis, but is truly just a criminal. He theorizes Molly must have obtained the book and learned hypnosis, and formulates a plan. After one performance of \"Stars on Mars\", Nockman kidnaps Petula, threatening to kill her if Molly does not comply with his orders, and she cannot hypnotize him because he always wears the anti-hypnotic glasses he bought in Briersville. He orders her to use her talents to steal some rare jewels from a bank for him.\n\nHaving no choice, Molly agrees. All goes as planned with the robbery until she finds Rocky, who much to her surprise has also learned hypnosis. He had previously stolen and learned from the missing chapters of Molly's hypnotism book, \"Long Distance Hypnosis\" and \"Voice-Only Hypnosis\". He also reveals that he had intended to take Molly with him when he was adopted, but had not been able to hypnotize his parents. Since then, he left them as they were not much fun. Working together, the two successfully pull off the robbery, but later form a plan to return the jewels. Rocky uses his power of voice-only hypnotism to hypnotize Nockman into giving up his life of crime. He then helps Molly return the stolen jewels by placing them in hollow garden gnomes and placing them around the city. However, Molly keeps one diamond, which Petula found in her jacket.\n\nMolly gives her part in \"Stars on Mars\" back to Davina, and returns home with Rocky. Out of sympathy for the broken man, she takes Nockman with her. Before leaving, they work together to record a commercial, using their hypnotic powers to convince people to be kind to their kids. However, when they return, they find Ms. Adderstone and Edna have disappeared, believing that the children there will be happier without any grownups around to tell them what to do, leaving the orphanage in chaos. The older children, once close, have fought amongst themselves, and the younger children have hidden themselves away upstairs, too scared of the older children and the rats they think are living in the orphanage to venture down into the kitchen. With Nockman's help, Molly and Rocky get the orphanage back into a livable condition, and get the sweet-natured Ms. Trinklebury, the orphanage maid, to run it along with Nockman. The orphanage is renamed 'Happiness House' and the money that Molly earned in New York is used to buy new things and redecorate the orphanage. However, it is implied that Nockman has returned to his old ways as he steals a camera, a lollipop and five pounds from children in the orphanage.\n\nAt the end of the book, Molly is mysteriously summoned to the library by the librarian, Lucy Logan. Lucy explains that she is the descendant of Professor Logan, the man who originally wrote the hypnotism book, and is a skilled hypnotist herself. She had purposely hypnotized Molly into finding Professor Logan's hypnotism book and keeping it for a month. Now, Molly has come back to return it.\n\nIn an epilogue, it is revealed what happened to Ms. Adderstone and Edna; Ms. Adderstone left to become a pilot, and Edna is now an Italian chef.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor Georgia Byng completed the book in 2001 while nursing her new-born child. David Heyman, producer of the Harry Potter films, bought the book's film rights in 2002. That same year, HarperCollins bought the rights to publish the book in the United States for a six-figure amount.\n\nIn 2003, 85,945 copies of the book were sold by HarperCollins. In 2004, sales for the book increased to 102,589. The book won the Massachusetts Children's Book Award in 2006.\n\nIn a starred review, \"Publishers Weekly\" stated the novel \"offers delightfully dastardly villains, a sympathetic heroine who lives out every child's dream and plenty of fast-paced action.\" Terry Miller Shannon from Kidsreads.com, in a positive review, felt that themes of friendship and responsibility added meaning to the story. A reviewer from \"Kirkus Reviews\" stated that although \"Molly’s solutions to problems are amusing\", \"[t]he salvation of archetypically evil (and archetypically disgusting) villains is dissatisfying\". Susan Rogers, writing in \"School Library Journal\", compared the novel to \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", stating \"Molly Moon's story doesn't match their clever and elegant way with words, but it does have something they lack-a satisfying and very moral ending.\" Mary Thomas, in \"CM: An Electronic Reviewing Journal of Canadian Materials for Young People\", gave the book two stars out of four, calling the book trite and derivative.\n\nA film based on the movie titled \"Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism\" was released on April 11, 2015.\n\n"}

Lahousen became a member of a circle of hand-picked officers opposed to Hitler who ran the intelligence agency. Canaris appointed him chief of Abwehr section II, which dealt primarily with the Brandenburgers and sabotage.\n\nLahousen handled the successful sabotage aspects of the invasion of Poland in September 1939. But because Canaris did not give as much a priority to sabotage as to espionage, Lahousen ordered that agents destined for Britain be trained primarily for spying, with disastrous results. Saboteurs who landed in the United States during Operation Pastorius in June 1942 were betrayed to the FBI by one of their number, arrested, tried by military tribunal, and executed.\n\nIn 1943, Lahousen was sent to the Eastern Front and thus escaped the final days of the Abwehr, which, along with Canaris, had fallen into disfavour. Lahousen later claimed that he was the one who supplied the bomb used on the Smolensk plot (Operation Spark, 13 March 1943). The assassination attempt carried out by Fabian von Schlabrendorff failed.\n\nAfter the failure of the assassination attempt and putsch (20 July plot), Claus von Stauffenberg and thousands of other accused plotters, including Canaris, were executed. Due to his service at the front, Lahousen escaped notice. On 19 July 1944 Lahousen was heavily wounded by an artillery hit.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Lahousen voluntarily testified against Hermann Göring and 21 other defendants at the Nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945–1946. Lahousen was the first witness for the prosecution, his prominence due to being the sole survivor of the 'Abwehr resistance'. Among other things, he gave evidence about the murder of hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war and the Einsatzgruppen death squads, who murdered more than a million Jews in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Ukraine.\n\n"}

Kane spent 36 years as a news anchor in Philadelphia, and is the only person to have anchored at all three Philadelphia owned and operated television stations. Early in his career, he was the only broadcast journalist to travel to every stop on the Beatles' 1964 and 1965 American tours. He has authored three books about the Beatles, as well as a memoir and a novel. Now semi-retired, he is a special contributor for KYW News Radio.\n\nKane was born in Brooklyn, New York. His parents changed the name years before his broadcasting career. Kane's father was an electrical contractor. His mother, Mildred Kane, fought multiple sclerosis for 14 years before her death at age 40. His work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society began because of his mother's involvement with the disease. He began his career in broadcast journalism in Miami, Florida at age 16, first at WQAM and later at WAME and WFUN. While working at WAME, Kane became the first U.S. news correspondent to break the story of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961.\n\nAs the only broadcast journalist to travel to every stop on the Beatles' 1964 and 1965 tours, Kane authored the book \"Ticket to Ride\" in 2003. Kane also authored \"Lennon Revealed\", a \"New York Times\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" Bestseller in 2005. Kane is considered one of the premiere American experts on the life of John Lennon. On July 30, 2013, Kane's internationally distributed book, \"When They Were Boys: The True Story of the Beatles' Rise to the Top\" was released.\n\nKane was also one of the contributors to Yoko Ono's 2005 book \"Memories of John Lennon\", in which he recalled how Lennon cohosted the Philadelphia \"Helping Hand Marathon\" fundraiser in 1975 and gave a weather forecast on Kane's television newscast.\n\nIn 1965, he came to Philadelphia as an anchor for WFIL Radio and as main anchor for its sister station WFIL-TV, Philadelphia's ABC affiliate. Kane was the later the primary anchor for the (then new) \"Action News format\". WFIL-TV would change its call letters to WPVI-TV in 1971 after Capital Cities Communications purchased the station from Triangle Publications. Kane is credited with coining the phrase \"The Big Story\" at the top of \"Action News\", something WPVI uses to this day. Kane would leave WPVI in 1977, in order to take daily limousine trips to New York City and join WABC-TV.\n\nKane was an anchor on New York's WABC-TV's \"Eyewitness News\" for one year from 1977 to 1978; during that time, he was the lead anchor the night after the infamous New York City blackout of 1977 and also anchored news updates for ABC News.\n\nHe returned to Philadelphia in late 1978 and joined WCAU-TV, then a CBS-owned station, as the primary anchor of \"Channel 10 News\" at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. In 1993 he moved to KYW-TV, an NBC affiliate which became the new CBS station in Philadelphia in 1995. He also hosted a short-time weekly program produced by KYW-TV called \"The Bulletin with Larry Kane\" (not to be confused with the defunct \"Philadelphia Evening Bulletin\" newspaper). Kane anchored the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts at KYW until December 23, 2002.\n\nKane covered local Philadelphia politics through hosting several public affairs programs. Kane was an anchor at WCAU when sources considered reliable tipped erroneously that Philadelphia mayor William J. Green was subject of federal investigation for improprieties. The story was later retracted, and Green sued CBS.\n\nIn 1994, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Kane into their Hall of Fame. On November 22, 2002, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia presented him with their \"Person of the Year\" award, their highest honor.\n\nUntil its 2017 shutdown, he hosted \"Larry Kane: Voice of Reason\", a weekly news analysis program on the Comcast Network. Kane continues to do special reports for KYW, an all-news AM radio station in Philadelphia.\n\nA veteran of 23 political conventions since 1964, Kane published in 2000 his first book \"Larry Kane's Philadelphia\", a regional bestseller.\n\nIn 2011, Kane released his first novel, \"Death by Deadline\", a cautionary mystery about the dangers of bad information, and the risks of out-of-control local TV news operations.\n\nRecognized as a leading proponent of the rights of the disabled, Kane is campaign chairman of the Delaware Valley Multiple Sclerosis Society. For 35 years Kane has broadcast weekly features on radio and TV in connection with the National Adoption Center to find homes for waiting children. He is also involved in many other non-profit endeavors.\n\nKane resides in suburban Philadelphia with his wife Donna. Donna is the president of Dynamic Images Inc., a multifaceted production company, and an officer of DJNY and its Unique Quest training product. Larry and Donna have a son, Michael, who lives in Connecticut with his wife Kate. They also have a daughter, Alexandra, who lives in suburban Philadelphia with her husband, Doug.

The first restaurant, Benihana of Tokyo, was named for the red safflower that was the name for the coffee shop owned by his parents in Tokyo.\nAoki's concept was for the meals to be theatrically prepared by a knife-wielding, joke-telling chef at a teppanyaki table surrounded by a wooden eating surface in front of the guests (Teppan meaning \"steel grill\" or \"griddle\" and yaki meaning \"grilled\" or \"broiled\"). It did not do well until early 1965, when Clementine Paddleford of the \"New York Herald Tribune\" gave it a rave review. The Beatles and Muhammad Ali were among the celebrities who then descended on the four-table restaurant.\n\nWithin a year Aoki opened a bigger restaurant that featured samurai armor, heavy wooden ceiling beams, and sliding shōji screens to provide some privacy.\n\nIn 1968, it opened its first restaurant outside of New York City in Chicago.\n\nIn 1976, Aoki brought in consultant Hardwicke Companies (its founder Charles H. Stein was the original developer of Six Flags Great Adventure as well as operated various New York restaurants including Tavern on the Green) as a partner to run the company. In 1980, Aoki terminated the relationship and settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint of insider trading of Hardwicke stock.\n\nIn 1982, Benihana National Corporation went public with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the restaurants continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including the opening of the upscale Big Splash restaurant and a frozen food division Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name.\n\nIn 1995, the company acquired 17 restaurants from Benihana of Tokyo.\n\nThe company has since expanded by purchasing the Haru and RA Sushi restaurants, which operate under those names. Haru is based in New York City; RA has locations across the country, and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its original four locations scattered around the greater Phoenix area. Although Benihana owns these concepts, they are independently operated and were developed autonomously. It also acquired the Samurai and Kyoto restaurants which it has incorporated into its other brands.\n\nIn 2004, the company issued a class of preferred stock to BFC Financial corporation to renovate its restaurants and expand. The stock diluted Aoki's control of the chain and the family sued, citing that Benihana had no compelling need for the cash, other forms of capital were available, and that the terms of the preferred stock issued to BFC were onerous. A member of the board of directors was also a director of BFC, a company that held controlling interests in BankAtlantic, Blue Green, and Levitt Homes. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the decision.\nBenihana's famous figural \"tiki mugs\" for exotic cocktails, the most common of which depicts \"Hotei,\" a chubby buddha-like figure with arms raised in the air, have become collectible.\n\nAoki died in 2008 at the age of 69. \n\nIn 2009, Richard C. Stockinger became chief executive to replace Joel A. Schwartz, and in 2010 became president as Juan C. Garcia resigned.\n\nBenihana agreed in 2012 to be purchased by the private equity firm of Angelo Gordon & Company for $296 million.\n\nOn February 5, 2014, the Board of Directors of Benihana Inc. named Steve Shlemon the company's new President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn 2016, Benihana Inc. named Thomas J. Baldwin CEO and president. Baldwin had been director of Benihana and served as an advisor to the operator's principal investor, Angelo, Gordon & Co.\n\nIn \"Benihana of Tokyo, Inc. v. Benihana, Inc.\", financial issues and a change of corporate control led three of the members of the Benihana, Inc.'s board of directors to consider the issuance of convertible stock and its sale to a potential buyer. Eventually, the entire board approved resolutions ratifying a stock purchase agreement with the buyer and authorizing the stock issuance. Afterwards, the company filed an action against almost all of Benihana, Inc.'s directors, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties.\n\nOn January 30, 2011, Benihana (Kuwait) filed a defamation lawsuit against a blogger for writing about his experience on his website. Las Palmas, the company that owns Benihana in Kuwait, took legal action against the reviewer for his \"negative\" attitudes towards the restaurant and for recording the videos without permission. The company alleged that the blogger worked for an advertising company and might have personal motives that could be linked to his work to denigrate Benihana and praise its competitors located in the same area.\n\nBenihana operates or franchises restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, and the Caribbean and Central and South America.\n\n\n\n"}

These English settlers were described as \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\", referring to their taking up Irish law, custom, costume and language. The introduction to the text of the statutes claim,\nOriginal Anglo-Norman: \"... ore plusors Engleis de la dit terre guepissant la lang gis monture leys & usages Engleis vivent et se governement as maniers guise et lang des Irrois enemies et auxiant ount fait divers mariages & aliaunces enter eux et les Irrois enemyes avauntditz dont le dit terre et le lieg people de icelle la lang Engloies ligeance a nostre seignour le Roy Duc et lez leis Engleis illoeques sont mis en subjection et retrets...\"\n\n... now many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies; and also have made divers marriages and alliances between themselves and the Irish enemies aforesaid; whereby the said land, and the liege people thereof, the English language, the allegiance due to our lord the king, and the English laws there, are put in subjection and decayed...\nThe statutes tried to prevent this \"middle nation\", which was neither true English nor Irish, by reasserting English culture among the English settlers.\n\nThere were also military threats to the Norman presence, such as the failed invasion by Robert Bruce's brother Edward Bruce in 1315, which was defended by the Irish chief Domhnall Ó Néill in his Remonstrance to Pope John XXII, complaining that \"For the English inhabiting our land ... are so different in character from the English of England ... that with the greatest propriety they may be called a nation not of middle medium, but of utmost, perfidy\". Further, there was the de Burgh or Burke Civil War of 1333–38, which led to the disintegration of the estate of the Earldom of Ulster into three separate lordships, two of which were in outright rebellion against the crown.\n\nThe prime author of the statutes was Lionel of Antwerp, better known as the Duke of Clarence, and who was also the Earl of Ulster. In 1361, he had been sent as viceroy to Ireland by Edward III to recover his own lands in Ulster if possible and to turn back the advancing tide of the Irish. The statutes were enacted by a parliament that he summoned in 1366. The following year, he left Ireland.\n\nMany of the \"statutes\" (or \"chapters\") of the 1366 parliament repeated \"ordinances\" made by a great council held in 1351, also in Kilkenny.\n\nThe statutes begin by recognising that the English settlers had been influenced by Irish culture and customs, as quoted above. They forbade the intermarriage between the native Irish and the native English, the English fostering of Irish children, the English adoption of Irish children and use of Irish names and dress. Those English colonists who did not know how to speak English were required to learn the language (on pain of losing their land and belongings), along with many other English customs. The Irish pastimes of \"horlings\" and \"coiting\" were to be dropped and pursuits such as archery and lancing to be taken up, so that the English colonists would be more able to defend against Irish aggression, using English military tactics.\n\nOther statutes required that the English in Ireland be governed by English common law, instead of the Irish March law or Brehon law and ensured the separation of the Irish and English churches by requiring that \"no Irishman of the nations of the Irish be admitted into any cathedral or collegiate church ... amongst the English of the land\".\n\nThe mistrust the English had of the Irish is demonstrated by Statute XV, which forbade Irish minstrels or storytellers to come to English areas, guarding against \"the Irish agents who come amongst the English, spy out the secrets, plans, and policies of the English, whereby great evils have often resulted\".\n\nWhile the Statutes were sweeping in scope and aim, the English never had the resources to fully implement them. Clarence was forced to leave Ireland the following year (and died the year after that), and Hiberno-Norman Ireland continued to gain a primarily Irish cultural identity. Only at the beginning of the 17th century would another attempt to colonise Ireland begin to make appreciable gains. The Statutes of Kilkenny ultimately helped to create the complete estrangement of the two \"races\" in Ireland for almost three centuries.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was most active in his hometown of Lyon. Garnier is considered the forerunner of 20th century French architects. \n\nAfter learning painting and drafting at the École Technique de la Martinière in Lyon (1883-86), Garnier studied architecture at the École nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon (1886-89) and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1890-99). In 1899 he won the Prix de Rome for a design of a national bank. The prize enabled him to reside at the Villa Medici in Rome for four years, until 1904. During his stay in Rome he began working on the project of an industrial city that became his main contribution to town planning. \n\nIn 1901, after extensive study of sociological and architectural problems, he began to formulate an elaborate solution to the perceived issues concerning urban design. His basic idea included the separation of spaces by function through zoning into several categories: industrial, civic, residential, health related, and entertainment. Garnier's drawings for an ideal industrial city called \"Une cité industrielle\" were initially exhibited in 1904, but only published later in 1918. \n\n\"Une Cité Industrielle\" was designed as an utopian form of living, for 35,000 inhabitants. It was located between a mountain and a river to facilitate access to hydroelectric power. This plan was highly influenced by the writings of Émile Zola, in particular his socialist utopian novel \"Travail\" (1901). The plan allowed schools and vocational-type schools to be near the industries they were related to, so that people could be more easily educated. There were no churches or law enforcement buildings, in hope that man could rule himself. The idea of functional separation was later taken up by the members of CIAM, and would ultimately influence the design of cities like Brasilia. \n\nIn 1904 Garnier returned to Lyon, where he received a commission for a livestock market and slaughterhouse (1906-24), later named Halle Tony Garnier. In 1910 he was commissioned for the design of the Édouard-Hérriot Hospital, completed in 1927. Further projects included several villas, the Stade de Gerland (Gerland stadium) (1914-18) and the low-cost housing \"Quartier des Etats-Unis\" (1919-35) on United-States avenue in the 8th arrondissement of Lyon. \n\nIn the 1920s Garnier continued the work on several major projects started before the war. In 1939 he moved from Lyon to Roquefort-la-Bédoule, where he died in 1948. He is buried in the Croix-Rousse cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

Commercial operation of the plant began in April 2010. The scheme diverts water from the Nam Theun, a tributary of the Mekong River, to the Xe Bang Fai River, enabling a generation capacity of , from a difference in elevation between the reservoir and the power station.\n\nIt is the largest hydroelectric project so far in Laos, exporting power to Thailand and supplying the local area with electricity. At the time of signing in 2005, NT2 was the largest foreign investment in Laos, the world's largest private sector cross-border power project financing, the largest private sector hydroelectric project financing, and one of the largest internationally financed IPP projects in Southeast Asia. The dam also marked a return by the World Bank to funding large-scale infrastructure, after a decade-long hiatus.\n\nAccording to the government of Laos, \"the project is an essential part of the country's development framework and the project's implementation is likely to be the first real possibility for (Laos) to reduce gradually its dependence on Official Development Assistance\".\n\nThe project has significant environmental and social impacts, and comprehensive measures have been designed to mitigate these. According to a group of social and environmental experts who advise on the project, these measures could become a global model. Although \"Newsweek\" referred to it as a \"kinder and gentler dam\", the project also attracted criticism.\n\nBy 2015, it was possible to see the effect of the dam and criticism mounted. A group of non-governmental organisations said: \"Ten years after the start of the construction of the Nam Theun 2 Dam in Central Laos, it is clear that this mega project has disastrous impacts on people and their environment.\"\n\nThe Nam Theun 2 project was identified in the 1980s and a concession was awarded in 1993. It was subjected to a long anti-dam campaign. The project was frozen after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, but preparation resumed in 1999. In October 2002 a concession contract between the Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) and the government of Laos was signed, followed by the signing of power purchase agreements (PPA) in November 2003 between NTPC on the one hand and, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the Laotian state-owned power company Electricite du Laos (EDL) on the other. Financial closing was reached in June 2005. The Nam Theun River diversion was begun in March 2006 and then closed in April 2008 following completion of the Nakai Dam wall. Impoundment of the Nakai Reservoir occurred over the 2008 wet season and the reservoir was close to full supply level by the end of 2008. Test hydro power generation began in mid-2009 and the commercial operation date was achieved in April 2010.\n\nNT2 enables Laos to export of electrical energy to the EGAT. The project also supplies of capacity for domestic use in Laos.\n\nNam Theun 2 is a trans-basin diversion power plant that uses water from the Nam Theun River and releases the water into the Xe Bang Fai River.

At the end of the concession period, the project facilities will be transferred to the government free of charge.\n\nThe project was developed by NTPC, which is owned by a consortium composed of EDF (40%), Electricity Generating PCL (EGCO) of Thailand (35%), and the Government of Laos (25%). Governments and government-owned enterprises own a majority of NTPC. This arrangement is atypical of an IPP. Normally the power generating company is privately owned.\n\nLaos is a People's Democratic Republic (PDR) with a one-party system under the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. It is one of the few communist states in the world.\n\nThe government has multiple roles related to NT2, some of which may be conflicting: It partially owns NTPC and thus has an interest in the financial profitability of the project; it is supposed to monitor compliance with environmental and social safeguards under the concession contract; and it buys some of the electricity generated from the project through the state-owned power company EDL and thus has an interest in low electricity prices.\n\nSome of the owners of NTPC are also contractors engaged in the construction of the dam. For example, EDF International is the lead contractor for the project under a turnkey contract. It has engaged various sub-contractors for specific parts of the project.\n\nConstruction costs were initially estimated at US$1,250 million plus US$331.5 million for contingencies. More recently construction costs have been given as US$1.3 billion.\n\nThe project base cost is funded through US$330 million of equity and US$920 million of debt. It is financed through equity, loans and guarantees from 26 financial institutions, including\n\nAll financing in hard currencies is guaranteed through political risk insurance provided by the above-mentioned three export credit agencies, the ADB (US$50 million), the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group (US$50 million), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group (US$91 million). Specifically, MIGA has provided a US$86 million guarantee to Fortis Bank of Belgium against the risks of expropriation, breach of contract, war and civil disturbance, as well as transfer inconvertibility in both Laos and Thailand. According to MIGA, its guarantee \"was key to lowering the project's risk profile, which in turn enabled the government and developers to attract commercial financing at better rates and gave the investor the assurance needed to go ahead with the deal\".\n\nThe government's initial equity contribution of US$83 million (25%) was largely funded by donors, including a US$20 million grant from the International Development Association of the World Bank Group, the ADB (US$20 million), France, and the EIB.\n\nAccording to the government \"the Project is an essential part of the country's development framework and the Project's implementation is likely to be the first real possibility for (Laos) to reduce gradually its dependence on Official Development Assistance.\" In the same vein, the then Managing Director of the World Bank, Shengman Zhang, said in 2003 \"We see Nam Theun 2 not as a project \"per se\", but as a vehicle through which to make a considerable progress in the effort of poverty reduction.\" \n\nThe project generates three forms of revenue:\n\nGovernment revenue is estimated at US$1.9bn to US$2bn in nominal terms over 25 years. It has been estimated that at a 10% discount rate the net present value of the revenues will be six times higher than the net present value from the debt service, if all government equity was funded through concessionary lending. Revenues are expected to increase progressively from approximately US$10M in 2009 to US$110 to 150M per year at the end of the concession period in 2033. Thereafter the government will receive all revenues accruing to the project.\n\nThe Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between EGAT and NTPC was designed as to stabilize the cash flow despite hydrological variation and consequently variation in power output. Revenues will be partially in USD and partially in Thai baht. Power demand from Thailand is expected to be strong. In December 2007, Thailand and Laos signed an agreement increasing the total power to be supplied by Laos to Thailand from all sources in 2015 from 5,000 MW to 7,000 MW.\n\nThe World Bank works with the Lao government to improve public financial management practices and increase transparency in order to increase the likelihood that revenues will be used to benefit the poor, including through investment in health and education. The government has agreed with the World Bank to implement a Poverty Reduction Fund that is being initially sourced from International Development Association funds, and then from the government's taxes, royalties, and dividends once the project commences operation. Special administrative units are being established to deal with the effective management and allocation of the funds earned by the project.\n\nIn 2007 Laos was ranked on the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International 168 out of 179 countries assessed, making it one of the most corrupt countries on the index.\n\nEnvironmental and social impacts of the project include downstream impacts, impacts on biodiversity, resettlement, and reservoir sedimentation. More details can be found in the Environmental and Social Impact assessment, and in the summary provided for the various impacts below.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation NT2 has a multi-layer environmental and social monitoring and evaluation mechanism consisting of the following elements:\n\n\nThe comprehensive environmental and social measures designed to mitigate potential environmental and social impacts could become a \"global model\", according to a group of social and environmental experts who advise on the project.\n\nAccording to the NGO International Rivers, there have been substantial shortcomings in the mitigation of impacts. According to the organization, compensation payments and replacement land for villagers affected by construction activities have been \"inadequate, unfair or non-existent\". Poor resettlement planning has led to housing and infrastructure delays. Plans to restore the livelihoods of villagers on the Nakai Plateau and along the Xe Bang Fai have yet to be finalized. And the budget for the downstream program in particular is said to be inadequate.\n\nBruce Shoemaker, editor of \"Dead in the Water\", claims that the scientific consensus is that the dam's costs outweigh its benefits and that the dam represents a \"complete failure of water governance in [the] Mekong region.\"\n\nAccording to data in the World Bank publication \"Good dams, bad dams\", the ratio of area flooded and people resettled per megawatt of installed electricity generating capacity (flooded area of 41 hectare per MW and five persons resettled per MW) is neither very high nor very low, compared to 48 other large dams analyzed. Using this specific analytical framework, Nam Theun 2 could neither be considered a \"good\" or a \"bad\" dam.\n\nThe flow of water in the Xe Bang Fai (XBF), which will receive the water diverted through NT2, will increase significantly, thus affecting the population living downstream of the release point.\n\nThe exact number of people affected is disputed. While NTPC speaks of 40,000 affected people, the NGO Environmental Defense speaks of up to 150,000 people. The impacts have been widely studied and have been discussed with local communities. Possible negative impacts on the downstream population include the washing away of river bank gardens, changes in water quality, and impacts on fisheries. The impacts will only be exactly known once the project has been completed.\n\nNTPC has promised to stop power production when floods occur on the Xe Bang Fai. However, it is as yet unknown exactly how long this flooding period will last for each year. The length of the period will affect the project's profitability.\n\nWater quality may be negatively impacted through fouling of biomass in the reservoir. Because the impacts are unknown, monitoring systems will be included and a commitment has been made to \"adaptive management\".\n\nLivelihood development programs are underway for the villagers living downstream on the Xe Bang Fai, in districts such as Mahaxai. The programs are focused on agriculture, fish ponds, and handicrafts to help them generate income beyond that derived from fishing. The objective is to help villagers generate money from a variety of different sources to compensate for any changes in fishing catches after the river diversion. Affected communities expect to receive irrigation systems to allow for a second, dry season rice crop, drinking water systems, and access to electricity. The provision of this infrastructure would not be the responsibility of NTPC, but of the government.\n\nAccording to a joint progress report issued by the World Bank and the ADB in December 2007, implementation of the downstream program – particularly on implementing livelihood programs – remained a challenge. Lessons from the 20 villages where the programs have been piloted in a participatory manner are being applied as other villages were included. Micro-credit schemes that are being developed were not yet on a sustainable financial footing.\n\nThere is relatively little information on downstream impacts on the Nam Theun River, where water flows will be significantly reduced. No permanent villages lie along the Nam Theun some 50 km downstream below the dam. Fishermen and hunters, however, do use this stretch of the river. Fish diversity and abundance is expected to be affected by reduced water flows and sediment content. Monitoring of the villages along the river conducted by NTPC has not yet detected any significant impacts to the fishery.\n\nThree existing protected areas on the Nakai plateau (the Nakai-Nam Theun, the Hin Nam Nor, and the Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Areas), together nine times larger (4,106 km) than the flooded area, are expected to be better managed through significant resources made available under the project – more than 60 times what the government has spent on its entire national parks system so far. The flooded areas are not considered critical natural habitat. Formerly there was significant illegal logging in the protected areas, which the government claims has now been largely brought under control despite growing evidence that villagers are using logging to supplement falling incomes.\n\nDetailed fish surveys showed that there are no fish species living only in the stretch of the river that will be inundated. A management plan for the Asian elephants in the area has been drawn up. A Watershed Management Protection Authority (WMPA) has been established with the specific purpose of protecting the watershed of the reservoir and the protected areas in it. WPMA will receive US$1M annually from NTPC through the concession period.\n\nSeventeen villages and their 6,300 inhabitants moved from the area that became the NT2 reservoir on the Nakai Plateau to custom-built villages built in consultation with the resettled communities. NTPC and the Lao Government have committed to doubling the income of resettled villagers, through livelihood programs, five years after they have been relocated. This means that people who used to make US$410 per household a year in 2005 should make at least US$820 per household a year by 2012.\n\nConstruction of the villages and major facilities (new roads, water pumps, toilets, schools, mills, and electricity) was completed by mid-2008. Consultations on house design, location, and construction materials were held and continue to ensure the outcomes reflect the needs of the local people. According to a World Bank report, the health of villagers who have already been resettled has significantly improved due to better water and sanitation, regular health check-ups and the provision of mosquito nets, as documented by various assessments. Experts are helping the resettled villagers to adopt improved practices to increase agricultural and income productivity. The report stresses that the pace of the development of the livelihood activities must be accelerated including engaging additional technical assistance to help villagers develop the most effective cropping systems possible.\n\nAt current sedimentation rates, the reservoir has a lifetime of more than five centuries. If substantial logging occurred in the upstream basin, the lifetime would be accordingly reduced and could affect the financial and economic viability of the project. This would especially be the case if sediments remained in the active storage area in the upper part of the reservoir instead of being washed into the dead storage area closer to the dam in the lower part of the reservoir. The establishment of the relatively well-funded Watershed Management Protection Authority is expected to protect forest cover and thus limit erosion in the watershed of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2017185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017185", "title": "The Light in the Piazza (musical)", "text": "The Light in the Piazza (musical)\n\nThe Light in the Piazza is a musical with a book by Craig Lucas and music and lyrics by Adam Guettel. Based on the 1960 novella by Elizabeth Spencer, the story is set in the 1950s and revolves around Margaret Johnson, a wealthy Southern woman, and Clara, her daughter, who is developmentally disabled due to a childhood accident. The two spend a summer together in Italy. When Clara falls in love with a young Italian man, Margaret is forced to reconsider not only Clara's future, but her own deep-seated hopes and regrets as well.\n\nThe score breaks from the 21st century tradition of pop music on Broadway by moving into the territory of Neoromantic classical music and opera, with unexpected harmonic shifts and extended melodic structures, and is more heavily orchestrated than most Broadway scores. Many of the lyrics are in Italian or broken English, as many of the characters are fluent only in Italian.\n\n\"The Light in the Piazza\" was developed as a musical at the Intiman Playhouse in Seattle in June 2003 and then at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago in early 2004. After 36 previews, the Broadway production opened on April 18, 2005, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center, where it ran for 504 performances and closed on July 2, 2006. The musical was directed by Bartlett Sher, choreographed by Jonathan Butterell, with lighting by Christopher Akerlind, set by Michael Yeargan and costumes by Catherine Zuber. The cast featured Victoria Clark, Kelli O'Hara, Matthew Morrison, Michael Berresse and Sarah Uriarte Berry. Chris Sarandon joined the cast as Signor Naccarelli later in the run, Aaron Lazar was a replacement in the role of Fabrizio Naccarelli and Katie Rose Clarke was a replacement in the role of Clara Johnson. In the pre-Broadway production in Seattle and Chicago, Kelli O'Hara played the role of Franca rather than Clara (who was played by Celia Keenan-Bolger), and Steven Pasquale had played Fabrizio, but could not open on Broadway due to a conflict with the television series \"Rescue Me\" that he had just joined.\n\nOn June 15, 2006, shortly before its closing night, the show was broadcast on the PBS television series \"Live from Lincoln Center\", and drew more than two million viewers. The cast consisted of Victoria Clark (Margaret Johnson), Katie Rose Clarke (Clara Johnson), Aaron Lazar (Fabrizio), Chris Sarandon (Signor Naccarelli), Patti Cohenour (Signora Naccarelli), Michael Berresse (Giuseppe Naccarelli), Sarah Uriarte Berry (Franca), and Beau Gravitte (Roy Johnson).\n\nA United States national tour starring Christine Andreas as Margaret, Elena Shaddow as Clara, and David Burnham as Fabrizio Naccarelli started at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, California, in August 2006 and ended in Chicago on July 22, 2007.\n\nA Japanese production of the musical was produced in December 2007, having a limited engagement of about a month. It starred Kaho Shimada as Margaret Johnson.\n\nAn Australian concert version had a one-night presentation at the Lyric Theatre, Star City in Sydney on August 17, 2008. The cast consisted of members of the Australian company of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", with Jackie Rees as Margaret, Kathleen Moore as Clara and James Pratt as Fabrizio. The production was directed by John O'May.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Guettel reconfigured the musical as a smaller chamber piece for the Weston Playhouse Theatre Company in Vermont, where Sarah Uriarte Berry reprised her role as Franca.\n\nThe show had its opera house premiere in October 2008 at Piedmont Opera in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It starred Jill Gardner as Margaret and Sarah Jane McMahon as Clara, directed by Dorothy Danner and conducted by James Allbritten.\n\nThe first Los Angeles area local premiere was seen at the Covina Center for the Performing Arts in 2009. It starred Christopher Callen as Margaret, Brooke Tansley as Clara and Craig D' Amico as Fabrizio (all Broadway veterans) under the direction of Brady Schwind.\n\nThe Lethbridge Symphony Orchestra in Alberta presented the musical at the Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre October 19–21, 2009, which was the Canadian première. Directed by Fran Rude and musical direction by Ken Rogers this production starred Diane Llewelyn-Jones as Margaret, Nicole Higginson as Clara and Steven Morton as Fabrizio.\n\nThe Berkeley Street Theatre in Toronto saw the Canadian première by Acting Up Stage running in February 2010.\n\nThe Arena Stage (Washington, DC) production ran from March 5, 2010 through April 11, 2010, with Hollis Resnik as Margaret.\n\nThe European premiere was directed by Paul Kerryson at the Curve theatre, Leicester, UK, in May 2009, starring Lucy Schaufer as Margaret and Caroline Sheen as Clara, with design by George Souglides, musical direction by Julian Kelly, lighting design by Giuseppe di Iorio, sound design by Paul Groothuis.\n\nA highly acclaimed production at Theo Ubique Cabaret Theater in Chicago opened on March 11, 2012, starring Kelli Harrington as Margaret and Rachel Klippel as Clara. Harrington's performance won the Jeff Award for Best Actress. The run was extended through June.\n\nThe 2013 Shaw Festival production ran in rep at the Court House Theatre in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, Canada. Previews began July 4, 2013 with the official opening July 26, 2013;\nthe show closed on October 13. The musical was directed by Jay Turvey and starred Patty Jamieson as Margaret Johnson.\n\nFront Porch Theatricals (Pittsburgh) staged a performance in August 2015. It received rave reviews from both local and national critics with BroadwayWorld hailing the overall production and Josh Grosso in the role of Fabrizio. The cast included Becki Toth as Margaret and Lindsay Bayer as Clara. It was directed by Stephen Santa.\n\nOn April 4, 2016, the entire original Broadway cast reunited for a benefit concert version of the musical at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, where it originally played.\n\nThe musical was produced in London at Royal Festival Hall from June 14, 2019 to July 6, starring Renée Fleming as Margaret Johnson and Dove Cameron as Clara. Daniel Evans directed. This production then moved to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles in October, the Lyric Opera of Chicago in December with Solea Pfeiffer taking over as Clara.\n\n\nAct 1\n\nIn the early morning of their first day in Florence, Margaret reads from her guidebook to Clara as the piazza around them is waking up and coming to life (\"Statues and Stories\"). A breeze carries Clara's hat off her head and across the square where a young Italian man, Fabrizio, catches it, mid-air, and returns it to her. The two are instantly smitten. But Margaret steers her daughter away from the encounter, bringing her next to the Uffizi Gallery where the reaching figures in the paintings speak to Clara of her own yearnings (\"The Beauty Is\"). Fabrizio appears, hoping to arrange a time to meet with Clara, but once again Margaret intervenes.\n\nAlone, Fabrizio sings in Italian his declaration of love at first sight for Clara, along with a heartfelt cry of fear that she could never love anyone as lost and without position as he (\"Il Mondo Era Vuoto\"). Fabrizio begs his father and his brother Giuseppe to help him dress more presentably for Clara. Giuseppe attempts to teach Fabrizio some dance steps as well (\"American Dancing\").\n\nAt the Duomo, Fabrizio once again catches up with Margaret and Clara, and this time Fabrizio's father, Signor Naccarelli, is able to help penetrate Margaret's resistance to any further involvement. They all agree to meet at sunset to take a walk and admire the view of the city from above at the Piazzale Michelangelo (\"Passeggiata\").\n\nMargaret and Clara are invited to have tea at the Naccarelli home. Giuseppe's wife, Franca, takes Clara on a tour of the apartment, and alone in a separate room, she warns Clara about how quickly love can stale in marriage (\"The Joy You Feel\"). Though the Naccarellis are universally impressed with Clara, Margaret tries without success to share her deep reservations. When she looks in Fabrizio's eyes and sees the love there, she cannot bring herself to disappoint him, as much as she feels she must; for there is something about Clara that none of these people know. Clara secretly makes plans to meet Fabrizio at midnight near the hotel.\n\nMargaret calls her husband Roy, who is back in the states. She tries to tell him what is happening with Clara and Fabrizio, but he is brusque and not very understanding, cutting short the conversation. Margaret, alone in her hotel room, reflects on the loneliness in her marriage (\"Dividing Day\"). She checks in Clara's room, and finds that she is missing.\n\nOn her way to meet Fabrizio, Clara becomes lost in the maze-like streets of Florence. She loses all poise and control, becoming hysterical and screaming like a child (\"Hysteria\"). Her mother takes her back to the hotel and, as Clara sleeps, reveals the source of her disquiet. When Clara was a young girl, she was kicked in the head by a Shetland pony, and the accident has caused her mental and emotional abilities to develop abnormally. Margaret feels that she must take Clara away from Florence at once, and she steps down into the lobby to have a drink. While she is away, Fabrizio comes to the room, distraught; he cannot find the right words to express his feelings, and Clara urges him to use any other means; Clara accepts Fabrizio's proposal of marriage, and the two are embracing, half undressed, as Margaret walks in on them (\"Say It Somehow\").\n\nAct 2\n\nMargaret takes Clara to Rome to distract her and put an end to the affair. Back in Florence, the Naccarelli household is in complete chaos. As the family despairs, Signora Naccarelli translates in an aside; Fabrizio believes he has ruined everything with Clara, his father attempts to comfort him, and Giuseppe and Franca desire finer details (\"Aiutami\").\n\nNo matter what Margaret tries, her daughter refuses to give her an inch, culminating in a painful confrontation wherein Margaret slaps Clara across the face. Clara erupts with a torrent of feeling, centered on Fabrizio and the nature of love (\"The Light in the Piazza\"). This causes Margaret to relent, to set aside her doubts and considerations, and to no longer stand in the way of the wedding. The two return to Florence.\n\nClara is instructed in the Latin catechism in preparation for converting to Catholicism while around her everyone in the extended family sings of their feelings, stirred up by the immediate presence of such intense, young love (\"Octet Part 1\"). Franca, in an attempt to arouse her husband's jealousy, kisses Fabrizio right on the mouth, and Clara witnesses it, breaking into a furious rant that ends with her throwing a drink on Franca. As Clara breaks down, Franca commends her for her bravery and declares her own desire to fight for Giuseppe. She toasts the upcoming union and is joined by the rest of the family (\"Octet Part 2\").\n\nAt the wedding rehearsal, Clara and Fabrizio are filling out the necessary forms when Signor Naccarelli sees something on Clara's form that causes him to call off the wedding and take his family away at once. Clara wants to know what is wrong with her, but her mother says there is nothing at all wrong. With Clara sobbing and broken, alone in one of the pews of the church, Margaret reveals her worst fears and her shame at having been the source of her daughter's lifelong suffering. She resolves to do whatever it takes to give Clara a chance for happiness (\"The Beauty Is [Reprise]\").\n\nMargaret tries to reason with Signor Naccarelli, who saw Clara's childlike handwriting as she completed her marriage form. Seemingly unconcerned with her immaturity or her handwriting, Signor Naccarelli admits that he saw Clara write her age on the forms – 26 – and that this makes her an unsuitable bride for his son who is only 20. Relieved that he has not discovered their secret, Margaret begs him to change his mind, but he will not. She invites him to take a walk with her, and the two wander from one end of Florence to the other as the sun slowly sets and the night comes on (\"Let's Walk\"). By giving him time to mull things over and by not pressuring him, Margaret succeeds in putting the wedding back on track; Signor Naccarelli says he will meet them at the church the following morning.\n\nFrom the hotel room, Margaret calls Roy to tell him about the wedding. As might be predicted, he insists that Clara cannot handle the responsibilities of marriage. Clara, in her wedding dress, stands in the shadows, overhearing her mother's side of the conversation. Margaret says, \"Just because she isn't normal, Roy, doesn't mean she's consigned to a life of loneliness. She mustn't be made to accept less from life just because she isn't like you or me.\" Shattered, Clara slips out of the hotel room and runs once more through Florence (\"Interlude\"), meeting Fabrizio at the church in order to tell him that she cannot marry him; she won't allow herself to cause him any pain. Fabrizio assuages all of her fears (\"Love to Me\").\n\nMoments before the wedding, Clara tells Margaret she can't leave her; Margaret assures her she can. Left alone, Margaret breaks open all the repressed doubts and yearnings that she has carried for years on end about love, realizing at last that the chance of love somehow outweighs the terrible risks. She joins the wedding ceremony (\"Fable\").\n\n\"CurtainUp\" called the musical a \"gorgeously staged and musically sophisticated adaptation... the Guettel sound is nevertheless plush and enjoyable with a genuine musical theater sensibility... Lucas has made room for the young lovers' voices and retained enough of the psychological complexities to prevent this from being the dated soap opera it could easily have been.\" Michael Feingold, in his review for the \"Village Voice\", commented: \"It has some considerable shortcomings...but its main distinction is that its humanity separates it from the bulk of current musical theater.\"\n\nCritic John Simon, in \"New York\" magazine, wrote: \"Anyone who cares about the rather uncertain future of this truly American genre should – must – see the show, think and worry about it, and reach his or her own conclusions ... Craig Lucas's book seems perfectly adequate to me, but the emphasis must be on Adam Guettel's music and lyrics ... the music, though fluctuating between the Sondheimesque and offbeat but still Broadwayish and the art-songlike and even operatic, is steadily absorbing, even if only intermittently melodious. One duet, \"Let's Walk\", is an unqualified hit, but the rest, without fully cohering, is also arresting. Ted Sperling and Guettel's jaunty orchestrations add to the slightly disorienting but wholly fascinating harmonies and instrumentation.\"\n\nBen Brantley, in \"The New York Times\", deemed the show \"encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled... the production comes into its own only in the sweetly bitter maternal regrets and dreams of Margaret Johnson.\" He further made special mention of the \"gorgeous autumn-leaf-strewn set\", the \"lush golden lighting\" and \"the delectable period costumes\".\n\nIn reviewing the revival starring Renee Fleming in 2019, Chris Jones said the show employed, \"the most soul-satisfying score written for Broadway so far this century.\" He concluded, \"'Piazza' is still very much alive and, in this staging, as vital as ever.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2017190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017190", "title": "Tachikoma", "text": "Tachikoma\n\nProduction I.G was unable to use the Fuchikoma design in the 2002 \"Stand Alone Complex\" anime television series due to copyright conflicts. However, Masamune Shirow was able to design a legally safe equivalent to the spider-tanks for the new show, which he named the \"Tachikoma\". There are distinct differences in the design, most significantly in the eye-equivalents and the vertically oriented abdomen. Still, the tanks are easily recognizable as descendants of the original Fuchikoma. Their AI personalities and roles in the new series are indistinguishable from their predecessors in the manga.\n\nTachikoma are as large as an average sedan, are painted blue and have four \"eyes\" fitted on the surface of their bodies. Three are on the \"head\" and one is beneath the abdomen. Each eye has three pinholes, loosely resembling a bowling ball. These eyes sometimes become expressive in the typical anime style. Tachikoma are controlled by individual AIs, are capable of speech and generally exhibit a childish, curious, joyful and active personality, although they are consummate professionals in the field. They normally operate as independent units and receive orders from human agents, but they can also be directly piloted from a cockpit in their abdomen. The Tachikoma's design is implicitly based on that of the jumping spider in terms of bio-mechanical modelling, and system technical design was based on the Fuchikoma.\n\nTachikoma have two arms and four legs. They can move by walking, or they can drive at high speed by using the wheeled footpads on each of their four legs. Each wheel appears to be angled and omnidirectional, allowing the Tachikomas to move in any direction with their drive system, which can control all degrees of freedom in its task space. Other abilities of the Tachikoma include jumping great distances, sticking to vertical or inverted surfaces, engaging a thermoptic camouflage mechanism, and grappling/rappelling using their adhesive string launchers. Tachikoma maintain control of their legs while using wheels to drive down a road, and shift their weight around turns. They can also roll briefly on to two legs while driving to avoid an obstacle or pass through a narrow space. To make balance easier, they can move their heavy abdomens with a ball joint.\n\nStandard Tachikoma equipment includes a 7.62×51mm light machine gun mounted in the right arm, a secondary weapon hardpoint in the \"snout\" (a 50 mm grenade launcher, capable of launching both explosive and gas grenades which can be replaced by a six-barrelled 12.7×99mm Gatling gun), a universal cybernetic connector on an extensible, prehensile cable in the left arm, liquid wires that can be used for grappling, rappelling or for restraining purposes and a built-in thermoptic camouflage system.\n\nThough they possess individual artificial intelligence, every night they are synchronized, so they start the next day with identical consciousnesses that are each the sum of their total collective experience and development. This leads to identity confusion, since each Tachikoma has the same memories. Though the Tachikoma have identical memories, their personalities and opinions are distinct. It is explained in the last episode of the first season that it is their curiosity that lets them be different from each other.\n\nThese individual personalities are distinct among Tachikoma. One considers itself Batou's personal Tachikoma, which has a personality of a hyperactive child. It is special, given that Batou pampers it with natural oil and refuses to operate any other while on assignments. The second Tachikoma is more logical, acting as the straight man to the first. The third Tachikoma appears somewhat slower than the others, and at times has difficulty keeping up with the other Tachikomas when discussing such in-depth topics as what it means to be \"alive\". There is also a fourth Tachikoma with a distinctive personality, who is a bookworm and an intellectual. Its body was taken apart during the experimentation incident, but its AI has presumably been saved for further analysis. During finale of the first \"S.A.C.\" season, while all but three of the Tachikomas are either locked away in a lab or dismantled for study, three surviving Tachikoma units abandon their civilian posts to assist the Major and Batou.\n\nDr. Asuda is the government researcher who single-handedly developed the neurochip used in the Tachikomas' AI and is considered by the Tachikomas to be their father. In the episode \"Afternoon of the Machines – PAT,\" Asuda tries unsuccessfully to defect from Japan, because as a state-funded scientist, he is not allowed to hold patents on his inventions. Following his re-capture, the Tachikoma who is with The Major and Batou asks whether Dr. Asuda is its father. Desiring to leave a record of his achievement, Asuda inserted a trace of himself in the Tachikomas' memory during their reconstruction post-season 1. To prevent another collapse in the AI structural integrity, he decided to delete this last bit of sentimentality.\n\nIn episode 12 of the \"\", one slightly malfunctioning Tachikoma goes on a joy-ride through the city, where it meets a young girl named Miki who is looking for a lost dog. The episode is mostly comedy but turns serious, with the Tachikoma attempting to understand sadness and death. In a later episode, the Tachikomas argue among themselves over which met Miki, since they all have the same memory. Yet when Batou calls for his Tachikoma only his actual Tachikoma raised its hand. As it leaves with Batou, it suddenly remarks with quiet surprise that it indeed must have been the one that met Miki.\n\nBatou has the most affection for the tanks, picking out one tank as his \"personal unit\" and spoiling it with natural oil instead of synthetic. This is what causes his to go haywire later, when the natural oil dissolves some of the proteins in the Tachikoma's AI neurochip. On the other hand, Togusa, the least cyberized of the Section 9 staff, holds a less idealist view: \"they're just machines.\" Aside from leading to an indignant outburst from the Tachikomas (who accuse Togusa of bigotry), it sets up something of an antagonistic relationship between Togusa and the tanks, which is revisited in an episode in season two. Major Motoko Kusanagi holds the most pragmatic view of all. Her only regret following the Tachikomas' suicide attack is that she didn't get a chance to dive their AI, and discover whether or not what they had acquired was really a \"ghost\". In the manga, she expresses concern over the evolution of the Tachikomas' AI and orders it monitored to catch any undesired emotional developments or an unwanted \"rise of the robots.\"\n\nBy the end of the series, the Tachikoma fleet start approaching sapience; all are sent back to the lab for dissection, amidst fears that they are no longer fit for combat duty. It is the use of natural oil in Batou's personal Tachikoma (all other units used synthetic lubricant) that acted as a catalyst for the behavioral anomalies that began to manifest as sapience. Major Kusanagi subsequently bans the use of natural oil prior to the later decision to halt deployment of Tachikomas in field ops.\n\nThree Tachikoma survive the mandatory decommissioning, (one blue, calling itself \"Batou's Personal Tachikoma\", and two others, repainted yellow and silver) and prove their worth when they abandon their new civilian jobs to save their imperiled comrades, without explicit orders to do so. The silver Tachikoma is destroyed on sight after it rescues Batou from attack by an Armed Suit, a bipedal power-actuated armored exoskeleton. The blue and yellow Tachikoma combine their efforts to save him, and conduct a desperate and ultimately suicidal attack against the Umibozu, while Batou watches from a nearby terrace with a stricken look on his face. This selfless act is the last thing they ever do. Those sent to the lab for structural analysis were restored from backups, their AI given a slew of upgrades and loaded into a new fleet, which appears in the second season.\n\nIn the second season, \"\", the enforced synchronizations among Tachikomas are limited to essential data only. Motoko Kusanagi allows them to maintain their own personality after the events in the first season. They can still share information and sensation via synchronization should they choose to. The Tachikomas are also outfitted to perform complex networking tasks including net-diving to aid Section 9. Several episodes featured the Tachikomas operating in the net using a representational avatar, instead of their map symbol of a triangle in a circle. It is indicated that while operating within the net, they could not inhabit their physical units.\n\nIt is hinted that Tachikoma units developed ghosts. During the finale of \"2nd GIG\", while ordered to create a repository in cyberspace for the memories (and hopefully, ghosts) of all refugees of Dejima, they secured instead their own memories within the netspace and sacrificed their AI satellite to prevent a nuclear explosion. A fellow AI, the bioroid Proto, saw this and announced to the viewers that Tachikomas do indeed have ghosts.\n\nDuring the early portion of the film \"\", the Uchikomas are seen being used by Section 9 in a way similar to the way the un-learned Tachikomas had been used. It was revealed that the engineers at Section 9 failed to reproduce the phenomenon whereby the AI develops an advanced state of self-awareness. However, the reappearance of the Major also brings the return of the Tachikomas. Initially they are seen in their cyberspace avatar forms, sporting different decals and individual names such as Max, Musashi, Loki, and Conan (names directly lifted from the Major's AI partners in the \"Man-Machine Interface\" manga). Eventually they are reintroduced to physical bodies, and rejoin Section 9 as full members.\n\n, also known as \"Tachikoma Specials\" or \"Tachikoma Days\", are a series of shorts attached to the end of every episode of \"\". Each short takes features the antics of the Tachikoma think tanks of Section 9 and involves plot points from the episodes. \"\" also has Tachikomatic Days at the end of each episode and most of the DVD and iTunes releases of both series.\n\n\"Tachikomatic Days\" did not air on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim broadcast of \"Stand Alone Complex\" and \"2nd GIG\". However, they are shown on Adult Swim's free webcast programming service Adult Swim Video. On Australia's Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, the \"Tachikomatic Days\" shorts are broadcast with each episode. The UK's AnimeCentral broadcasts \"Tachikoma Days\" with each episode.\n\nNumerous Tachikoma merchandise items have been released by various companies, including a 1/24-scale plastic model kit produced by Wave in December 2005, and a 1/35-scale model produced by Kotobukiya in 2014.\n\n"}

It replaced Caledonia High School for the school year 1992/1993, which was converted into River Heights Public School. The school contains a gymnasium, cafeteria, workshop, library, day care centre, three science labs, twelve portables, an exercise room, music room, drama room, art room, guidance office, and five computer labs. There is a greenhouse in a courtyard located in the east quad. The surrounding grounds contain a baseball field, a soccer field and a football field with a track surrounding it. The fields are used by youth soccer teams during the sport seasons. The school is in close proximity to the new HCCC (arena)/library/Lions Hall and baseball diamond. It temporarily served as a home to the new population of River Heights Public School in fall 1991 while renovations and an expansion were created, it also held a \"church\" congregation as their \"church\" was being built. This was strange because MPSS is a public school. It is home to the SHSM (Specialist High Schools Major) program offering red seals (upon completion of the requirements) at graduation in hospitality, green industries, and construction. In the school year 2016–2017, all but two of the schools sports teams won their zones and progressed so SOSSA. Two of these teams (football and track and field) progressed to OFSSA. \n\nDue to the large number of Indigenous students attending the school, classes such as Cayuga language, native history, and native arts are offered. It also runs the Hockey Canada Skills Academy program at the HCCC during both semesters. There are three types of classes offered in the arts program: drama, music (including instrumental and guitar), and art (including visual art, media art, and photography). There are various communications, business and computer programming courses offered along with a full array of maths and sciences. As far as extracurricular clubs, there is the concert band, interact club, both general and executive students council (the executive attends OSLC every year), anime club, drama club, reach for the top, crime stoppers, yearbook, and many others. Sports teams include: lacrosse, badminton, cross country, hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, track and field, and tennis.\n\nThe 2018/2019 academic year saw over 900 students enrolled. The school is home to the largest Indigenous student body in the Grand Erie School District, at 29% or 260 students as of 2018/19.

In November 2005, he was acquired by the Pittsburgh Steelers, playing with them during their Super Bowl XL winning season. He finished up his playing years with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL before moving on to his coaching career. Seigler played under the tutelage of National Championship Head Coach Dennis Erickson and Mike Riley in the college ranks.

The 47th Disney animated feature film, it was released in standard and Disney Digital 3-D versions. The film is loosely based on characters from the children's book \"A Day with Wilbur Robinson\", by William Joyce. The voice cast includes Jordan Fry, Wesley Singerman, Harland Williams, Tom Kenny, Steve Anderson, Laurie Metcalf, Adam West, Tom Selleck, and Angela Bassett. It was the first film released after then-Pixar executive John Lasseter became chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios.\n\nLewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor who grew up in an orphanage, whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He works all night on a machine to scan his memory to locate his birth mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage when he was a baby. While taking the scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it has been sabotaged by the Bowler Hat Guy and falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner.\n\nWilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, however Lewis realizing that he can simply use the time machine to see his mother instead has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis does not stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinson family except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Having followed Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris try to kidnap him, but the Robinsons beat them back. The Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he is from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust.\n\nLewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \"Goob\" Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis' work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during an important Little League game and failed to make an important catch that cost the game. Goob became so bitter as a result that he was never adopted and remained in the orphanage long after it closed. Doris is \"DOR-15\", one of Lewis' failed and abandoned inventions. They both blamed Lewis for their misfortunes and decided to ruin his career by stealing the memory scanner and claiming credit for it. Leaving Lewis behind, they take off with the scanner, drastically altering the future to a world where Doris' clones have enslaved humanity. Lewis repairs the second time machine, confronts Doris and destroys her by promising to never invent her, restoring the future to its Utopian self. After persuasion from Lewis, Wilbur tries to ask the adult Goob to join the family, but he has disappeared, apparently ashamed at what he has done.\n\nBack in Wilbur's time, Lewis finally meets Cornelius face to face. Cornelius explains how the memory scanner started their successful career, and persuades Lewis to return to the science fair. Wilbur takes Lewis back, but makes one stop first: as he promised, he takes Lewis back to the moment when his mother abandoned him. Though Lewis approaches his mother, he ultimately decides not to interact with her, realizing the family he will come to have with Wilbur and others.\n\nWilbur drops Lewis off in his own time and leaves. Lewis heads to the fair, but en route wakes up Goob just in time for him to make the winning catch. Back at the fair, Lewis asks for one more chance to demonstrate his scanner, which this time succeeds. He is adopted by Lucille, one of the science fair judges, and her husband Bud, who nicknames him \"Cornelius\" and takes him home.\n\nThe film ends with a quote which reiterates the message of not dwelling on failures and \"keep moving forward\", attributed to Walt Disney.\n\nOriginally titled \"A Day with Wilbur Robinson\", production began in June 2004, and was scheduled for a 2006 release. While the film was in production, Disney announced on January 24, 2006 that it would be acquiring Pixar, and as a result, John Lasseter became the chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios. When he saw an early screening for the movie, he told the director Stephen Anderson that he did not find the villain scary or threatening enough, and suggested that he make some changes. Ten months later, almost 60% of the film had been scrapped and redone. The villain had improved and was given a new sidekick, a dinosaur chase had been added, and the ending was changed.\n\nOver 600 REAL D Cinema digital 3D-equipped theaters presented Disney Digital 3-D version of the film. The 3D version was preceded by the 1953 Chip 'n Dale 3D short \"Working for Peanuts\".<ref name = \"/Film\"></ref> The final credits of the 3D version were left two-dimensional, except for the names of those who converted the film to 3D.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray versions were both released on October 23, 2007. Both versions feature 1.78 widescreen aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, plus music videos, the \"Family Function 5000\" game, deleted scenes, and other bonus features. The DVD's audio commentary contains Anderson's narration, occasionally interrupted by himself as the Bowler Hat Guy. The Blu-ray also includes uncompressed 5.1 audio and a BD-J game, \"Bowler Hat Barrage!\". A 3D Blu-ray was released on November 8, 2011.\n\nAs of January 2008, the DVD had sold approximately 4 million copies.\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critics consensus states, \"\"Meet the Robinsons\" is a visually impressive children's animated film marked by a story of considerable depth.\" Metacritic reported the film had a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 27 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"Realmovienews\" stated that it has \"a snappy plot that demands close attention as it whizzes back and forth in the space-time continuum, touching on serious ideas and proposing some rather disturbing alternate realities. And the witty story twists are handled with rare subtlety and intelligence. In the end it may get a little weepy and inspirational. But it's so charming that we don't mind at all\". Danny Minton of the \"Beaumont Journal\" said that \"The Robinsons might not be a family you want to hang out with, but they sure were fun to meet in this imaginative and beautiful 3-D experience\". Andrew L. Urban of \"Australian Urban Cinefile\" said that \"Walt Disney stood for fantasy on screen and this is a loving tribute to his legacy\". Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" named it the 10th best film of 2007.\n\nConversely, A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"\"Meet the Robinsons\" is surely one of the worst theatrically released animated features issued under the Disney label in quite some time\", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"C\" and said \"This is one bumpy ride\".\n\nThe film grossed $25,123,781 on its opening weekend, falling behind \"Blades of Glory\". Over its theatrical run, it grossed $97,822,171 in the United States and Canada and $71,510,863 in other territories, totaling $169,333,034 worldwide.\n\nThe soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on March 27, 2007. Contributors to the album beyond the Danny Elfman score include the Jonas Brothers, Rufus Wainwright, Rob Thomas, Jamie Cullum, The All-American Rejects, and They Might Be Giants. The track \"Little Wonders\", recorded by Rob Thomas, reached number 5 on the \"Billboard\" AC chart and the top 20 in Australia and Canada.\n\nThe song \"This Much Fun\" by Cowboy Mouth, which was featured in the trailer, was not featured in the film or on the soundtrack. The song \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\" was originally from the Disneyland attraction General Electric's Carousel of Progress.\n\n\"Disney's Meet the Robinsons\" video game is available from Buena Vista Games for PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, and PC. The independent England-based company Climax Group developed their own adaption for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nDisneyToon Studios originally planned to make a sequel to the film, tentatively titled \"Meet the Robinsons 2: First Date\". However, when John Lasseter became Walt Disney Animation Studios' new chief creative officer, he called off all future sequels DisneyToon originally planned, including sequels to \"Chicken Little\" (2005) and \"The Aristocats\" (1970), and refocused on spin-off films and original productions.\n\n"}

It is the 48th Disney animated feature film. Directed by Chris Williams and Byron Howard, the film stars the voices of John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Malcolm McDowell, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson, Greg Germann, Susie Essman and Mark Walton. The film's plot centers on a white dog named Bolt who, having spent his entire life on the set of a television series, thinks that he has super powers. When he believes that his human, Penny, has been kidnapped, he sets out on a cross-country journey to \"rescue\" her.\n\n\"Bolt\" was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Despite a relatively marginal box-office performance, the film received a strong positive critical reception and is renowned for playing an important role in instigating what is widely referred to as the Disney Revival, as well as setting the studio in a new creative direction that would lead to other critically acclaimed features such as \"Tangled\" (2010) and \"Frozen\" (2013). \"Bolt\" was also Disney Animation's first feature film to be produced under the complete creative guidance of then-Pixar executive John Lasseter in his role as chief creative officer for the studio, as well as the first computer-animated feature film to implement non-photorealistic rendering.\n\nThis was one of the final film roles for James Lipton before his death on March 2, 2020, the other being \"Igor\", which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was nominated for a series of awards, such as the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nA White Shepherd puppy named Bolt is adopted by an eight-year-old girl named Penny. Five years later, Bolt and Penny star in a hit television series called \"Bolt\", in which Bolt uses various superpowers to protect Penny from the villain. To gain a more realistic performance, the show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real and that he really has superpowers, including a devastatingly powerful sonic scream-like \"superbark\". After a cliffhanger episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in Hollywood but knocks himself unconscious in the process and is trapped inside a box of foam peanuts which is shipped to New York City.\n\nIn New York, Bolt resumes his search for Penny and, much to his dismay and confusion, finds out the hard way that his \"superpowers\" are useless. He encounters Mittens, a feral cat who bullies pigeons out of their food. Bolt compels Mittens to guide him back to Penny — Mittens being convinced her captor is a lunatic — and the two start their journey westward by truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Penny is distraught over Bolt's disappearance but is convinced by the studio to continue filming with a less experienced lookalike dog.\n\nSurprised at his first feelings of hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute but needy dog, obtaining food for them both at an RV park. They are joined by Rhino, a fearless hamster and fanatical \"Bolt\" fan. Rhino's unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog's illusions about himself, but allows Mittens to figure out Bolt is from a television show. She tries to tell Bolt this, but Bolt simply becomes frustrated. Attempting to \"superbark\" her repeatedly, the noise draws the attention of an Animal Control patrol and Bolt and Mittens are both captured and taken to an animal shelter.\n\nBolt, freed from the patrol van by Rhino, finally realizes and accepts that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) exhorts him to heroism. They rescue Mittens from the shelter, and as they continue west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship in which she teaches Bolt how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for the three of them to stay in Las Vegas, but hearing Bolt is still drawn to find Penny, she tells him Penny is only an actor, and humans never truly love their pets, and eventually betray and abandon them, as happened to her. Bolt refuses to believe her and continues on alone to Hollywood; with Rhino's encouragement his two friends follow shortly after.\n\nBolt reaches the studio and finds Penny embracing his lookalike, unaware that Penny still misses him and her affection for the lookalike is only a part of a rehearsal. A broken-hearted Bolt leaves, but Mittens, on a gantry in the studio, sees Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt lookalike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some flaming torches, setting the sound stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives and the two reunite inside the burning studio, but are unable to escape before Penny begins to suffocate from the smoke. Penny begs Bolt to go but Bolt refuses to leave her. Bolt uses his \"superbark\" through the building's air vent, alerting the firefighters to their location and allowing both of them to be rescued in time.\n\nPenny and her mother quit when their overeager agent proposes they exploit the incident for publicity purposes. The show continues with a replacement \"Bolt\" and \"Penny\" and a new storyline involving alien abduction. Penny adopts Mittens and Rhino, and she and her family move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler, happy lifestyle with Bolt and her new pets.\n\n\nOriginally, the film was going to be titled \"American Dog,\" and was written and directed by Chris Sanders. Eventually, Sanders was removed from the project and replaced by Chris Williams and Byron Howard. The film's previous plot told the story of a dog named Henry, a famous TV star, who one day finds himself stranded in the Nevada desert with a testy, one-eyed cat and an oversized, radioactive rabbit who are themselves searching for new homes, all the while believing he is still on television. In 2006, after becoming Chief Creative Officer at Disney Animation, John Lasseter along with other directors from Pixar and Disney attended two screenings of the film and gave Sanders notes on how to improve the story. According to Lasseter, Sanders was replaced because he resisted the changes that Lasseter and the other directors had suggested. Lasseter was quoted as saying \"Chris Sanders is extremely talented, but he couldn't take it to the place it had to be.\" After Sanders left and the original title was removed, the animation team was told to complete the filming in 18 months instead of the usual four years that is normally required to produce a computer-animated feature. On June 8, 2007, Disney announced that the film, now under its current name, would be released on November 21, 2008 in Disney Digital 3-D.\n\nThe look of the film was inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper and the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. New technology in non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) was used to give it a special visual appearance, a technique later used in \"Tangled\" (2010). To give the film's 3D backgrounds a hand-painted look, the company artists used new patented technology designed specifically for the film.\n\nBolt's characteristics are based on an amalgam of breeds, although the designers started with the American White Shepherd. Joe Moshier, lead character designer, said, \"they American White Shepherds have really long ears, a trait that I tried to caricature in order to allow the animators to emphasize Bolt's expressiveness.\"\n\nThe design of Rhino in his plastic ball was based on executive producer John Lasseter's pet chinchilla, which was brought to an animators' retreat during the film's production.\n\nThe score to \"Bolt\" was composed by John Powell. The soundtrack featured the film's score and two original songs – \"I Thought I Lost You\" by \"Bolt\"'s stars Miley Cyrus and John Travolta (nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song on 2009) as well as \"Barking at the Moon\" by Rilo Kiley singer Jenny Lewis. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2008.\n\nAlthough Motörhead has a song in the film, they do not seem to appear in either the soundtrack or the score. Motörhead's song \"Dog-Face Boy\" (from their \"Sacrifice\" album) is in a mailroom scene where a young worker is listening to it on his headphones and inadvertently wraps Bolt up in a box that gets shipped off to New York City.\n\nTrack listing:\n\"Bolt\" was theatrically released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Beginning in its fourth week in theaters, the film was accompanied by Pixar's \"Cars Toons\" short \"Tokyo Mater\".\n\n\"Bolt\" was released on Region A Blu-ray Disc in the United States on March 22, 2009. The BD set included standard DVD and digital copy versions of the film. Single-disc DVD and Special Edition DVD with Digital Copy versions followed in Region 1 on March 24. This marked the first time a major home-video release debuted on Blu-ray Disc before DVD. \"Bolt\" was released on both Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom on June 15, 2009.\n\nA short film called \"Super Rhino\" is included in the DVD and Blu-ray versions of the film. The DVD has sold 4,581,755 copies, generating $81.01 million in sales as of December 31, 2009.\n\nThe 3D Blu-ray version of the film was released in November 2010, in France and UK. A month later it was released worldwide, exclusively to select Sony TVs. In US, it was released on November 8, 2011.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 89% based on 185 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \"\"Bolt\" is a pleasant animated comedy that overcomes the story's familiarity with strong visuals and likable characters.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a 67/100 approval rating based on 29 reviews following under the category \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nPerry Seibert of TV Guide gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote the film \"amuses both those who make up the film's target audience and the parents along for the ride. This winning mix of exciting action, heart-tugging sentiment, and gentle character comedy makes \"Bolt\" yet another solid addition to Disney's history of family-friendly fare.\" Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a B+ stating that \"\"Bolt\" is the studio's first film since \"Lilo & Stitch\" that feels like it's trying to recapture the old Disney instead of aggressively shedding it in favor of something slick and new. And yet it comes with a healthy cutting-edge Pixar flavor as well.\" Kenneth Turan of \"The Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"[\"Bolt\"] also has an intriguing plot that is kind of the family animation version of the Jim Carrey-starring \"The Truman Show\".\"\n\nOn its opening weekend, the film opened number 3 with $26.2 million behind \"Twilight\" and \"Quantum of Solace\". On its second weekend, it rose to No. 2 behind \"Four Christmases\" with a 1.4% increase. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $114.1 million by its closing date on February 22, 2009. An additional $195.9 million was made internationally , for a worldwide total of $310 million.\n\n\"Bolt\" was nominated for the following awards:\n\nDisney Interactive Studios produced a video game based on the film, released in November 2008 for Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. The game focuses on Bolt's fake TV life, not the actual storyline. A separate game was released for mobile phones, and a third game, \"RhinoBall\", was released as an application on Apple's App Store.\n\n"}

The extreme case of low cardinality is Boolean data (e.g., does a resident in a city have internet access?), which has two values, True and False. Bitmap indexes use bit arrays (commonly called bitmaps) and answer queries by performing bitwise logical operations on these bitmaps. Bitmap indexes have a significant space and performance advantage over other structures for query of such data. Their drawback is they are less efficient than the traditional B-tree indexes for columns whose data is frequently updated: consequently, they are more often employed in read-only systems that are specialized for fast query - e.g., data warehouses, and generally unsuitable for online transaction processing applications.\n\nSome researchers argue that bitmap indexes are also useful for moderate or even high-cardinality data (e.g., unique-valued data) which is accessed in a read-only manner, and queries access multiple bitmap-indexed columns using the AND, OR or XOR operators extensively.\n\nBitmap indexes are also useful in data warehousing applications for joining a large fact table to smaller dimension tables such as those arranged in a star schema.\n\nBitmap based representation can also be used for representing a data structure which is labeled and directed attributed multigraph, used for queries in graph databases.codice_1 article shows how bitmap index representation can be used to manage large dataset (billions of data points) and answer queries related to graph efficiently.\n\nContinuing the internet access example, a bitmap index may be logically viewed as follows:\nOn the left, Identifier refers to the unique number assigned to each resident, HasInternet is the data to be indexed, the content of the bitmap index is shown as two columns under the heading \"bitmaps\". Each column in the left illustration is a \"bitmap\" in the bitmap index. In this case, there are two such bitmaps, one for \"has internet\" \"Yes\" and one for \"has internet\" \"No\". It is easy to see that each bit in bitmap \"Y\" shows whether a particular row refers to a person who has internet access. This is the simplest form of bitmap index. Most columns will have more distinct values. For example, the sales amount is likely to have a much larger number of distinct values. Variations on the bitmap index can effectively index this data as well. We briefly review three such variations.\n\nNote: Many of the references cited here are reviewed at (John Wu (2007)). For those who might be interested in experimenting with some of the ideas mentioned here, many of them are implemented in open source software such as FastBit, the Lemur Bitmap Index C++ Library, the Roaring Bitmap Java library and the Apache Hive Data Warehouse system.\n\nFor historical reasons, bitmap compression and inverted list compression were developed as separate lines of research, and only later were recognized as solving essentially the same problem.\n\nSoftware can compress each bitmap in a bitmap index to save space. There has been considerable amount of work on this subject.\nThough there are exceptions such as Roaring bitmaps, Bitmap compression algorithms typically employ run-length encoding, such as the Byte-aligned Bitmap Code, the Word-Aligned Hybrid code, the Partitioned Word-Aligned Hybrid (PWAH) compression, the Position List Word Aligned Hybrid,<ref name=\"doi_10.1145/1739041.1739071\"></ref> the Compressed Adaptive Index (COMPAX), Enhanced Word-Aligned Hybrid (EWAH) and the COmpressed 'N' Composable Integer SEt. These compression methods require very little effort to compress and decompress. More importantly, bitmaps compressed with BBC, WAH, COMPAX, PLWAH, EWAH and CONCISE can directly participate in bitwise operations without decompression. This gives them considerable advantages over generic compression techniques such as LZ77. BBC compression and its derivatives are used in a commercial database management system. BBC is effective in both reducing index sizes and maintaining query performance. BBC encodes the bitmaps in bytes, while WAH encodes in words, better matching current CPUs. \"On both synthetic data and real application data, the new word aligned schemes use only 50% more space, but perform logical operations on compressed data 12 times faster than BBC.\" PLWAH bitmaps were reported to take 50% of the storage space consumed by WAH bitmaps and offer up to 20% faster performance on logical operations. Similar considerations can be done for CONCISE <ref name=\"doi_10.1016/j.ipl.2010.05.018\"></ref> and Enhanced Word-Aligned Hybrid.\n\nThe performance of schemes such as BBC, WAH, PLWAH, EWAH, COMPAX and CONCISE is dependent on the order of the rows. A simple lexicographical sort can divide the index size by 9 and make indexes several times faster. The larger the table, the more important it is to sort the rows. Reshuffling techniques have also been proposed to achieve the same results of sorting when indexing streaming data.\n\nBasic bitmap indexes use one bitmap for each distinct value. It is possible to reduce the number of bitmaps used by using a different encoding method. For example, it is possible to encode C distinct values using log(C) bitmaps with binary encoding.\n\nThis reduces the number of bitmaps, further saving space, but to answer any query, most of the bitmaps have to be accessed. This makes it potentially not as effective as scanning a vertical projection of the base data, also known as a materialized view or projection index. Finding the optimal encoding method that balances (arbitrary) query performance, index size and index maintenance remains a challenge.\n\nWithout considering compression, Chan and Ioannidis analyzed a class of multi-component encoding methods and came to the conclusion that two-component encoding sits at the kink of the performance vs. index size curve and therefore represents the best trade-off between index size and query performance.\n\nFor high-cardinality columns, it is useful to bin the values, where each bin covers multiple values and build the bitmaps to represent the values in each bin. This approach reduces the number of bitmaps used regardless of encoding method. However, binned indexes can only answer some queries without examining the base data. For example, if a bin covers the range from 0.1 to 0.2, then when the user asks for all values less than 0.15, all rows that fall in the bin are possible hits and have to be checked to verify whether they are actually less than 0.15. The process of checking the base data is known as the candidate check. In most cases, the time used by the candidate check is significantly longer than the time needed to work with the bitmap index. Therefore, binned indexes exhibit irregular performance. They can be very fast for some queries, but much slower if the query does not exactly match a bin.\n\nThe concept of bitmap index was first introduced by Professor Israel Spiegler and Rafi Maayan in their research \"Storage and Retrieval Considerations of Binary Data Bases\", published in 1985. The first commercial database product to implement a bitmap index was Computer Corporation of America's Model 204. Patrick O'Neil published a paper about this implementation in 1987. This implementation is a hybrid between the basic bitmap index (without compression) and the list of Row Identifiers (RID-list). Overall, the index is organized as a B+tree. When the column cardinality is low, each leaf node of the B-tree would contain long list of RIDs. In this case, it requires less space to represent the RID-lists as bitmaps. Since each bitmap represents one distinct value, this is the basic bitmap index. As the column cardinality increases, each bitmap becomes sparse and it may take more disk space to store the bitmaps than to store the same content as RID-lists. In this case, it switches to use the RID-lists, which makes it a B+tree index.\n\nOne of the strongest reasons for using bitmap indexes is that the intermediate results produced from them are also bitmaps and can be efficiently reused in further operations to answer more complex queries. Many programming languages support this as a bit array data structure. For example, Java has the codice_2 class.\n\nSome database systems that do not offer persistent bitmap indexes use bitmaps internally to speed up query processing. For example, PostgreSQL versions 8.1 and later implement a \"bitmap index scan\" optimization to speed up arbitrarily complex logical operations between available indexes on a single table.\n\nFor tables with many columns, the total number of distinct indexes to satisfy all possible queries (with equality filtering conditions on either of the fields) grows very fast, being defined by this formula:\n\nA bitmap index scan combines expressions on different indexes, thus requiring only one index per column to support all possible queries on a table.\n\nApplying this access strategy to B-tree indexes can also combine range queries on multiple columns. In this approach, a temporary in-memory bitmap is created with one bit for each row in the table (1 MiB can thus store over 8 million entries). Next, the results from each index are combined into the bitmap using bitwise operations. After all conditions are evaluated, the bitmap contains a \"1\" for rows that matched the expression. Finally, the bitmap is traversed and matching rows are retrieved. In addition to efficiently combining indexes, this also improves locality of reference of table accesses, because all rows are fetched sequentially from the main table. The internal bitmap is discarded after the query. If there are too many rows in the table to use 1 bit per row, a \"lossy\" bitmap is created instead, with a single bit per disk page. In this case, the bitmap is just used to determine which pages to fetch; the filter criteria are then applied to all rows in matching pages.\n\n"}

His literary work marked the transition to modern Albanian literature in Italy.\n\nSchirò was born in Piana dei Greci (now Piana degli Albanesi). While still young he was encouraged by his cousin Cristina Gentile Mandalà (1856–1919) to value his native Arbëreshë language and culture. She would assist him later in collecting local folktales and published a compilation of folktales herself. At the age of nine he wrote poem inspired by nationalism and dedicated to Albania's most important national hero Skanderbeg.\n\nIn 1890, he graduated with a law degree at the University of Palermo. However, his main passion remained classical and Italian folklore and literature, which he taught in 1888–1894 at the Garibaldi secondary school in Palermo. At the university he befriended Luigi Pirandello, who would become a world-famous novelist and playwright.\n\nHe wrote poems in both Italian and Albanian, and soon began to collaborate with literary and political writings in various periodicals. In 1887, he founded the magazine \"Arbri i rii\" (\"La giovine Albania\"/The young Albania), which was followed in 1890 with \"Archivio albanese\" (Albanian archive) and in 1904 with the short-lived \"La bandiera albanese\" (The Albanian flag).\n\nHis literary breakthrough was \"Rapsodie albanesi\" (Albanian Rhapsodies) in 1887, which made him known to Albanologists and Albanian patriots. In 1891, he published an imaginary love idyll \"Mili e Haidhia\" (Mili and Haidhia), which would eventually be published in three editions (1900 and 1907), including notes on traditions, legends, customs and traditions of Piana dei Greci. The work is considered to be a masterpiece of early 20th century Albanian verse and is probably his best work.\n\nA collection of patriotic songs \"Kënkat e luftës\" (The songs of battle), dedicated to Albanian independence, came out in Palermo in 1897, followed by the historical idyll \"Te dheu i huaj\" (To the foreign land) in 1900 about the epic escape of Albanians in the 15th century from their homeland and their arrival in Sicily. He also published work on Arbëreshë folklore in \"Canti sacri delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia\" (Sacred Songs of the Albanian Colonies in Sicily) in 1907, and \"Canti tradizionali e altri saggi delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia\" (Traditional Songs and Other Essays of the Albanian colonies of Sicily) in 1923.\n\nIn October 1895, Schirò along with fellow Italo-Albanians Girolamo de Rada and Anselmo Lorecchio organised a congress on Albanian national, cultural and linguistic self-determination that convened in Corigliano Calabro and it was followed by a second congress in Lungro during February 1897. Schirò's views on the Albanian question during the late Ottoman period were in support of revolution against the empire so as to take advantage of sympathy toward Albanians in the European press and influence European diplomacy toward supporting an uprising. For Schirò, the existence of the Ottoman Empire was on borrowed time and he was against Albanian-Ottoman cooperation to safeguard Albanian interests as for him it was counterproductive to achieving Albanian independence.\n\nIn 1900 he was appointed professor of Albanian language and literature at the \"Istituto Regio Orientale\" (Royal Oriental Institute) in Naples, where he would remain until the end of his life. From 1912 to 1914 Schirò worked in Albania as an inspector for Italian schools. Those were the years of the birth of an independent Albania, proclaimed in November 1912 after nearly 500 years of Ottoman rule.\n\nMeanwhile, he had laid the foundation of the \"Società nazionale albanese\" (Albanian National Society) to affect public opinion in favour for the independence of Albania, and for the same purpose composed a poem \"Fiamuri i Arbërit\" (The Albanian flag) and the book \"The Albanians and the Balkan question\", both in 1904. While devotedly Albanian, Schirò also admired Italy's cultural potential. He often advocated Italy's role, with its strong Arbëreshë minority, as a protector of the weak Albanian state against the hostile intentions of its Balkan neighbours. In 1913, Schirò participated in the Albanian Congress of Trieste for recognition of the political and economic independence of Albania.\n\nSchirò was fascinated with the early Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. In \"Kënkat e litorit\" (The Songs of the Littoral), published in 1926, he glorified the rise of the movement. In local politics, he was an unyielding opponent of Nicola Barbato, the socialist leader of his hometown Piana dei Greci. He supported the local Mafia boss Francesco Cuccia for mayor in April 1922. Schirò publicly defended the Mafia administration of Cuccia several times, considering it \"the most suitable for the peaceful development of the best qualities of its people,\" able to open \"a new period in our history.\" In a speech from the balcony of City Hall, he praised Cuccia to have had the merit and the courage \"to have done away with that red flag of socialism from our community.\"\n\nThe death of his son Mino, murdered in a political intrigue in July 1920, shed a heavy shadow over his final years. He dedicated the poem \"Mino\" to his son's death. Schirò died on 17 February 1927 in Naples.\n\nHis absolute belief in Italy as a potential protector and custodian of the culture of Albania conflicted with the aspirations of Albanian nationalists, which advocated absolute independence, including from Italy. Despite his accomplishments, Schirò was less appreciated by literary historians in Communist Albania and political criteria interfered with objective literary criticism.\n\nSchirò is considered to be one of the greatest figures of contemporary Sicilian Arbëresh literature. According to the scholar in Albanian literature and folklore, Robert Elsie, Schirò “first succeeded in blending the romantic elements of Arbëresh folk verse with the artistic precision of Italian classical and neo-classical poetry to form a harmonious and balanced poetic corpus. What Girolamo De Rada had done for Arbëresh literature in the 19th century, Giuseppe Schirò accomplished in the 20th.”\n\n"}

It was the first All-Star Game since the 1997 All-Star Game to use the Eastern Conference–Western Conference format.\n\nThe All-Star festivities began on February 1 with the YoungStars Game, pitting the best rookies on League rosters against each other. Months ago, it was decided that the assistant coaches of the team with the best points percentages in their respective conferences through the games of Wednesday, January 8, were selected as coaches for the Eastern Conference and Western Conference YoungStars, respectively. The YoungStars players were selected by the NHL's Hockey Operations Department, in consultation with League general managers.\n\nThe game's format changed from the previous season as it will be played using five skaters and one goaltender per team. The duration of the game will consist of three 20-minute periods, running time with three-minute stops after goals with a 20-minute break between periods. If the score is tied after three periods, a sudden-death shootout will determine the winner.\n\nThe Washington Capitals' Brian Sutherby won the Most Valuable Player for the Eastern Conference YoungStars by scoring two goals and an assist as the East cruised to an easy 8–3 victory. Hometown favourite Stephen Weiss also scored a goal and an assist for the East to thrill the Panthers fans in attendance.\n\nA traditional event followed the YoungStars game, with the NHL Skills Competition. The Western Conference won the competition 15–9, made memorable by hard-shooting defenseman Al MacInnis of the St. Louis Blues winning his seventh Hardest Shot event, and Colorado Avalanche's Patrick Roy allowed only a single goal through both of the Goaltending Competitions.\n\n\nOn Sunday, February 2, the actual All-Star Game began. The Eastern Conference was forced to name five injury replacements to their roster, as Ed Belfour, Brian Leetch, Mario Lemieux, Saku Koivu and Mats Sundin were all out with injury. The Atlanta Thrashers' Dany Heatley opened the scoring for the Eastern Conference by scoring past Colorado Avalanche's Patrick Roy just five and a half minutes into the first period.\n\nColorado's Peter Forsberg and Dallas Stars' Mike Modano scored the next two goals to give the Western Conference a 2–1 lead. However, Heatley would score his second consecutive goal on Roy, tapping in a rebound of a shot by Washington Capitals' Jaromir Jagr to tie the score at 2, a bit more than halfway through the first period. Five minutes later, Minnesota Wild's Marian Gaborik scored by banging in Los Angeles Kings' Mathieu Schneider's rebound past Tampa Bay Lightning's Nikolai Khabibulin to restore the Western lead at 3–2, which remained at the end of the first period. Goaltenders Roy and Khabibulin would then be replaced by Chicago Blackhawks' Jocelyn Thibault and New Jersey Devils' Martin Brodeur for the West and the East, respectively.\n\nThe change of goaltenders made little difference for Heatley, as he finished his hat trick with a wrist shot past Thibault to tie the game at 3. For the third consecutive time, the West replied when Vancouver Canucks' Ed Jovanovski caught a deflection off the skate of Washington Capitals' Sergei Gonchar. Heatley then scored his fourth goal of the game by converting a pass from hometown hero Florida Panthers' Olli Jokinen and shooting it over Thibault's glove. Heatley's four goals in an All-Star game tied the previous records of Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Vincent Damphousse and Mike Gartner and became the first player in All-Star history to score four goals with no one else scoring in between them.\n\nNo more goals were scored in the second period, and Ottawa Senators' Patrick Lalime came in to play goal for the Eastern Conference, while Dallas Stars' Marty Turco came in for the West. St. Louis Blues' Al MacInnis scored past Lalime's glove to give the West a 5–4 lead, a minute and a half into the third period.\n\nJokinen tied the game by taking a pass from Jaromir Jagr and skating in on a partial breakaway and putting a hard wrist shot past Turco to tie the game at 5. With ten minutes left in regulation, neither team were able to score on the two goaltender. The third period ended in a 5–5 tie and the winner of the 53rd NHL All-Star Game would have to be decided in overtime for the first time since 1988.\n\nPatrick Lalime and Marty Turco remained in goal for the overtime, and preserved a scoreless extra period. For the first time in history, an NHL All-Star Game would be settled in a shootout. The Vancouver Canucks' Markus Naslund, Dallas Stars' Bill Guerin and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim's Paul Kariya would score against Lalime for the Western Conference. On the other side, Turco only let in one goal in the shootout, which was scored by Dany Heatley. (Heatley's shootout goal did not count towards his regulation total of four, leaving him tied for the record.) The Western Conference won the game with a 6–5 shootout victory. Heatley, with a total of five points, was named All-Star MVP.\n\nThe NHL carried over the uniform design from the previous All-Star Game. Since the uniforms introduced the year before used the colors of the conference logos, the Western Conference used the same blue jersey worn by the 2002 North American team. However, due to the contrast issues from the 2002 game, the burgundy jersey worn by the World team was replaced with a white version worn by the Eastern Conference team. Both uniforms continued to feature black as the primary trim color, with silver and white accents. The player names and numbers on the back of the Western team's uniforms were rendered in black, however, leaving the uniforms completely devoid of the conference's burgundy color.

The song was also featured in the 1968 film \"The Green Berets\", based on Moore's book which starred John Wayne. A new edition of \"The Green Berets\" was published in April 2007 and his last book, \"Wars of the Green Berets\", co-authored with Col. Mike 'Doc' Lennon, was released in June 2007.\n\nAt the time of his death, Moore was residing in Hopkinsville, Kentucky (home to Fort Campbell and the 5th Special Forces Group) where he was working on his memoirs as well as three other books.\n\nBorn in Boston, Moore was raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where he attended Middlesex School. He also attended Belmont Hill School.\n\nDuring World War II he served as a nose gunner in the U.S. Army Air Corps, flying combat missions in the European Theater. For his service, he was awarded the Air Medal. Moore graduated from Harvard College in 1949, and one of his first jobs was working in television production and then at the Sheraton Hotel Company co-founded by his father, Robert Lowell Moore. While working in the hotel business in the Caribbean, he recorded the early days of Fidel Castro in the non-fiction book \"The Devil To Pay\".\n\nThanks to connections with Harvard classmate Robert F. Kennedy, Moore was allowed access to the U.S. Army Special Forces to write about this elite unit of the United States Army. It was General William P. Yarborough who insisted that Moore go through special forces training in order to better understand \"what makes Special Forces soldiers 'special'.\" He trained for nearly a year, first at \"jump school\" for airborne training before completing the Special Forces Qualification Course or \"Q Course\", becoming the first civilian to participate in such an intensive program. Afterwards, Moore was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group on deployment to Vietnam. His experiences in-country formed the basis for \"The Green Berets\", a bestseller that helped secure him international acclaim (see United States Army Special Forces in popular culture).\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s Moore travelled widely, spending time in such places as Dubai, Iran, Rhodesia and Russia. Having gathered the information needed he wrote \"The Crippled Eagles\" (later published as \"The White Tribe\") and \"The Moscow Connection\". Due to political controversy, \"The Crippled Eagles\" was rejected by publishers and did not appear until the early 1990s. (Rumor has it that the printing was quietly but firmly discouraged by the U.S. State Department). He also wrote the non-fiction books \"Rhodesia\" and \"Major Mike\" (with U.S. Army Major Mike Williams).\n\nMoore travelled to Uzbekistan in December 2001 to research the CIA-Northern Alliance war against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, publishing the account in the bestseller \"The Hunt for Bin Laden\".\n\nIn 2003, continuing his interest in writing about the war on terror, Moore traveled to Iraq to research Operation Iraqi Freedom and the downfall of the Saddam Hussein regime for his book, \"Hunting Down Saddam\". Before his death, he completed \"The Singleton: Target Cuba\" with Ret. USASF Major General Geoffrey Lambert, a novel about Fidel Castro and biological warfare.\n\nShortly after the publication of \"The Hunt for Bin Laden\", the veracity of the book was disputed, particularly regarding the involvement of Jack Idema. Idema, who was one of Moore's major sources, provided what later proved to be fabricated accounts of his exploits. In order to portray himself as having a greater role in the operation, Idema apparently went as far as to rewrite much of Moore's and Chris Thompson's text prior to publication under the direct authorization of Random House editor Bob Loomis. Special Forces soldiers who were on the mission (including those whom Moore interviewed) disputed Idema's claims.\n\nWith Idema thus discredited, Moore eventually disavowed \"The Hunt for Bin Laden\" and the book remains out of print. Despite the unfortunate fate of the book, Moore continued to enjoy the respect of the Special Forces community.\n\n\"The Green Berets\" is a 1968 film based on Moore's 1965 book. Parts of the screenplay bear little relation to the novel, although the portion in which a woman seduces a Vietnamese communist leader and sets him up to be kidnapped by Americans is from the book. John Wayne requested and obtained full military co-operation and materiel from President Johnson. To please the Pentagon, who were attempting to prosecute Robin Moore for revealing classified information, Wayne bought Moore out for $35,000 and 5 percent of undefined profits of the film.\n\n\nAt the 2007 5th Special Forces Group reunion banquet Col. Chris Conner confirmed Moore as a lifelong member of 5th SFG. At the same banquet Moore was made a Kentucky colonel.\n\nRobin Moore died in Hopkinsville, Kentucky on February 21, 2008 after a long illness. Eulogies were given by Rudi Gresham, General Victor Hugo, Major General Thomas R. Csrnko, Alexander N. Rossolimo and Moore's brother John. A Presidential citation was presented to Helen Moore by General Hugo. Full military honors were rendered immediately after the service.\n\nMajor General Gary L. Harrell, deputy commanding general of the United States Special Operations Command, issued this statement in praise of Moore:\n\n"}

He was a member of the U.S. ice hockey team that won a silver medal at the 1956 Winter Olympics and a gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics.\n\nWhile attending the University of Minnesota, Mayasich set the NCAA tournament record for most points scored in a game with eight against Michigan in 1954. Mayasich won the Western Collegiate Hockey Association scoring title in 1954 and 1955 and was an All-American three years in a row at his university.\n\nMayasich was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976 and the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989. Number 8 has been retired in his honor by the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey program, the only former Golden Gopher to be so honored. In 2011, Mayasich was ranked No 1 on the Minneapolis Star Tribune's list of \"Minnesota's 100 Greatest Players in High School Hockey History\".\n\nJohn was part of the 75th MSHSL ALL STAR TEAM. 3/9/19\n\nMayasich was born in Minnesota, to Croatian parents who had immigrated from the former Yugoslavia.\n\nHe attended Eveleth High School in Eveleth, Minnesota and participated in a number of sports. During his high school hockey career he set many individual records and helped his team achieve additional team records that stand even today. Among those records are the 46 total points he recorded at numerous state tournament games and helping his team win four consecutive state championships from 1948-51.\n\nMayasich played on both the 1956 Olympic silver medal team in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy and the 1960 Olympic Gold Medal team in Squaw Valley, California.\n\nHe is the Minnesota Gophers' all-time leading scorer with 144 goals and 154 assists in 111 games played, an average of about 1.3 goals per game. Mayasich also held scoring records in the high school ranks. While he still holds most state tournament records, a pair of Gophers, Dave Spehar and John Pohl, have since broken his all-time career scoring mark. Coach Doug Woog pointed out, \"We drew the parallel with Dave Spehar,\" Woog said. \"He (Spehar) was the most contemporary state tournament phenom; he had three hat tricks. John had seven. His numbers are phenomenal.\"\n\nMayasich briefly played some minor league hockey for the Green Bay Bobcats and Minneapolis Millers, earning extra money, but his professional career was in the broadcasting industry. After earlier positions, John joined Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc. (St. Paul) as General Manager of KS95 FM, guiding its growth to become one of the highest rated major market FMs in the country. In 1983, Mayasich was promoted to President of Hubbard's radio division, and served in that position until his retirement in 1997. He has remained active as a consultant to Hubbard.\n\n\n\n"}

A member of the Democratic Party, in 1992 she was the first woman elected to the U.S. Congress from the Commonwealth of Virginia. She served for one term (1993–1995) in the 103rd Congress.\n\nByrne grew up in Salt Lake City and attended both the University of Utah and Mount Vernon College in Ohio. Shortly after her family moved in 1971 to Northern Virginia, Byrne entered the public arena as an activist in community organizations and the Parent Teacher Associations for her children's schools. She served as President of the Fairfax Area League of Women Voters and Chairwoman of the Fairfax County Commission on Fair Campaign Practices.\n\nIn 1985, Byrne co-founded Quintech Associates, Inc., a project-based human resources consulting firm to the high-tech community. She served as president of Quintech until her election to Congress in 1992.\n\nShe is married to Larry Byrne, who is President of Byrne and Associates, an international consulting firm. They have two grown children, daughter Alexis and son Jason, and three grandchildren.\n\nByrne served in the Virginia House of Delegates for six years, having defeating two-term Republican incumbent Gwen Cody in 1985. She served until elected to the US House of Representatives in 1992 from the newly created (Virginia was awarded an additional House seat as a result of the 1990 U.S. Census.) \nShe is the first woman to have been elected to Congress from Virginia. 1992 was known as the \"Year of the Woman\" for the large number of women elected to Congress in that election. While a member of the 103rd Congress, she served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee and Subcommittees on Surface Transportation, Water Resources; and Investigations and Oversight. Representative Byrne was also a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, serving on the subcommittee on employee benefits and compensation.\n\nThe freshman Democratic members of the 103rd Congress elected her to the leadership position of freshman caucus whip. She introduced and passed more legislation than any other freshman representative. In addition, two of her measures on childhood immunization passed into law early in the first session of the 103rd Congress. Byrne played a role in preventing cuts in federal workers' wages and benefits. Additionally, she helped lead the effort to improve federal oversight of the nation's 1.7 million miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines. Byrne's legislative efforts included Medicaid reform; increasing opportunities of IRA holders to see their savings for first-time home purchases and college costs; cost savings on federal highway projects through value engineering; and enhancing the international market for American high technologies. She helped obtain funds for rail from Tysons Corner to Dulles Airport.\n\nThomas M. Davis, then chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, defeated her for re-election in 1994's \"Republican Revolution.\" His campaign charged that Byrne was too liberal for the swing district she represented and that her voting record was too supportive of President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn 1996, Byrne sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate to challenge incumbent Senator John Warner. Future Virginia Governor Mark Warner (no relation) won the nomination at the 1996 Virginia Democratic Convention, garnering 1,889 delegates to Byrne's 231. He lost to Senator Warner.\n\nIn 1998 Byrne took a job at United States Information Agency advising its director on the au pair program.\n\nByrne returned to elected office when she was elected to the Senate of Virginia in 1999, winning a very close election against two-term incumbent Republican Jane Woods (45.52% to Wood's 45.39%). She left the Senate after one term, choosing not to seek reelection after she was drawn into the same district as another Democratic incumbent during redistricting. In the Senate of Virginia she sponsored legislation to prohibit people from sleeping in rooms except bedrooms, a response to complaints of students and poor immigrants crowded into residential houses.\n\nByrne was the 2005 Democratic Party candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Republican Party candidate Bill Bolling defeated her in the November 8, 2005 general election by 1.2%.\n\nIn the United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006, Byrne endorsed future Senator James Webb for the Democratic nomination, while many local party activists supported his primary opponent, Harris Miller.\n\nIn 2008, Byrne ran for the Democratic nomination for Virginia's 11th congressional district, the seat she held from 1992 to 1994. She was the first to enter the race, well before the incumbent Thomas M. Davis, a Republican, had announced he would choose not to seek reelection. In the primary election on June 10, 2008, she faced Gerald Connolly, Doug Denneny and Lori Alexander. Connolly, Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, defeated Byrne by 58% to 33%, and went on to defeat Republican Keith Fimian in the general election.\n\nByrne has supported public/private partnerships for transportation, including the Dulles Greenway project when she was in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\n\n"}

It is a stochastic gradient descent method in that the filter is only adapted based on the error at the current time. It was invented in 1960 by Stanford University professor Bernard Widrow and his first Ph.D. student, Ted Hoff.\n\nThe realization of the causal Wiener filter looks a lot like the solution to the least squares estimate, except in the signal processing domain. The least squares solution, for input matrix formula_1 and output vector formula_2\nis\n\nformula_3\n\nThe FIR least mean squares filter is related to the Wiener filter, but minimizing the error criterion of the former does not rely on cross-correlations or auto-correlations. Its solution converges to the Wiener filter solution. \nMost linear adaptive filtering problems can be formulated using the block diagram above. That is, an unknown system formula_4 is to be identified and the adaptive filter attempts to adapt the filter formula_5 to make it as close as possible to formula_4, while using only observable signals formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9; but formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 are not directly observable. Its solution is closely related to the Wiener filter.\n\nThe basic idea behind LMS filter is to approach the optimum filter weights formula_22, by updating the \nfilter weights in a manner to converge to the optimum filter weight. This is based on the gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm starts by assuming small weights\n(zero in most cases) and, at each step, by finding the gradient of the mean square error, the weights are updated.\nThat is, if the MSE-gradient is positive, it implies the error would keep increasing positively \nif the same weight is used for further iterations, which means we need to reduce the weights. In the same way, if the gradient is negative, we need to increase the weights. The weight update equation is\n\nformula_23,\n\nwhere \nformula_24 represents the mean-square error and formula_25 is a convergence coefficient.\n\nThe negative sign shows that we go down the slope of the error, formula_24 to find the filter weights, formula_27, which minimize the error.\n\nThe mean-square error as a function of filter weights is a quadratic function which means it has only one extremum, that minimizes \nthe mean-square error, which is the optimal weight. The LMS thus, approaches towards this optimal weights by ascending/descending \ndown the mean-square-error vs filter weight curve.\n\nThe idea behind LMS filters is to use steepest descent to find filter weights formula_28 which minimize a cost function. \nWe start by defining the cost function as \nand is independent of the input formula_7 and the real (unknown) impulse response formula_4. In the general case with interference (formula_33), the optimal learning rate is\n\nThe results above assume that the signals formula_11 and formula_7 are uncorrelated to each other, which is generally the case in practice.\n\nLet the filter misalignment be defined as formula_37, we can derive the expected misalignment for the next sample as:\n\nLet formula_40 and formula_41\n\nAssuming independence, we have:\n\nThe optimal learning rate is found at formula_46, which leads to:\n\n\n\n"}

She came to prominence for her performances in several films directed by Brian De Palma in the 1970s and early 1980s. Her accolades include a Golden Globe Award nomination, and three Saturn Award nominations.\n\nThe daughter of a New York City police officer, Allen was raised in the Bronx, and attended the High School of Performing Arts, aspiring to have a career as a dancer. In her early twenties, she shifted her focus to acting, and relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career there. Her first major role was as Chris Hargensen in Brian De Palma's film adaptation of \"Carrie\" (1976). Allen was subsequently cast as the lead in the Robert Zemeckis-directed comedy \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" (1978), followed by a supporting part in Steven Spielberg's \"1941\" (1979).\n\nAllen married De Palma in 1979, and her subsequent portrayal of a call girl who witnesses a murder in his feature \"Dressed to Kill\" (1980) earned her a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year. She then appeared in De Palma's neo-noir film \"Blow Out\" (1981), playing a woman implicated in an assassination. Allen and De Palma divorced in 1984, and she appeared in the science fiction films \"Strange Invaders\" (1983) and \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" (1984), and Abel Ferrara's television film \"The Gladiator\" (1986). Allen garnered mainstream fame playing Anne Lewis in Paul Verhoeven's \"RoboCop\" (1987), a role she reprised for the two sequels that followed. Other credits include \"Poltergeist III\" (1988), \"Limit Up\" (1990), and \"Les patriotes\" (1994).\n\nAllen retired from acting in 2008, and became involved in anti-cancer activism after her friend, Wendie Jo Sperber, died of breast cancer. In 2010, she was named executive director of the weSPARK Cancer Support Center in Los Angeles, which was founded by Sperber.\n\nNancy Anne Allen was born on June 24, 1950 in the Bronx borough of New York City, the youngest of three children of Eugene and Florence Allen. Her father was a police lieutenant in New York. Allen was raised on 196th Street in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. \n\nAllen was very shy as a child, so her mother enrolled her in dance classes when she was four. She attended the Academy of Mount St. Ursula in the Bronx, before the family relocated to Yonkers. Interested in modern dance, Allen attended the High School of Performing Arts for one year, where she trained for a dancing career. Allen stated that her experience studying dance \"ruined it\" for her as it \"became all about grades...  I discovered that, while I loved to dance, I wasn't obsessed with it.\" She subsequently enrolled at Jose Quintano's School for Young Professionals.\n\nAllen's first major film role was very small, playing Nancy, Jack Nicholson's nervous date, in \"The Last Detail\" (1973), directed by Hal Ashby. This inspired her to move to Los Angeles to continue her acting career. Initially, Allen struggled to find acting jobs, and was told by an agent that, being 25 years old, it \"was over for her.\" However, in November 1975, she auditioned for the role of the spoiled and popular mean girl Christine Hargensen in director Brian De Palma's horror film \"Carrie\" (1976) opposite Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, and John Travolta, as the title character's chief nemesis. After a protracted casting process (in which Allen was nearly re-cast at the instruction of the producers), she was officially given the role.\n\nAllen next appeared in the role of Pam Mitchell in Steven Spielberg's production of \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" (1978), which was director Robert Zemeckis's first feature film. She then played Donna Stratton in the Spielberg-directed comedy \"1941\" (1979) opposite Tim Matheson, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and John Candy.\n\nShe married director Brian De Palma on January 12, 1979, and over the next several years appeared in three more of his films: She starred as Kristina in \"Home Movies\" (1980) with Kirk Douglas, followed by her portrayal of prostitute Liz Blake in the thriller \"Dressed to Kill\" (1980). For her performance, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for New Star of the Year. She next starred in her last collaboration with De Palma, the neo-noir \"Blow Out\" (1981), playing a woman involved in an assassination that is audibly captured by a sound engineer. In filming the latter, she had to overcome a lifelong fear of being trapped in a submerged car filling with water. \n\nIn 1983, Allen starred as supermarket tabloid reporter Betty Walker in \"Strange Invaders\", written by Bill Condon and co-starring Paul LeMat and Michael Lerner.\n\nShe and De Palma divorced in 1984. That same year, two of Allen's films were released, \"The Buddy System\" opposite Richard Dreyfuss and Susan Sarandon and \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" opposite Michael Paré. For her role in the latter, Allen was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. Allen began dating Paré after the production. She also hosted the documentary \"Terror in the Aisles\" (1984), which presents clips from various horror features, including \"Dressed to Kill\" and \"Carrie\". Paul Bartel's \"Not for Publication\" and \"Sweet Revenge\", an action caper about white slavery with Gina Gershon and Martin Landau, followed thereafter.\n\nAllen played police officer Anne Lewis in the science fiction/action classic \"RoboCop\" (1987) opposite Peter Weller in the title role. The film, which was the Hollywood debut of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, did extremely well at the box office. Allen was nominated for another Saturn Award for Best Actress.\n\nAfter the success of \"RoboCop\", Allen starred in Abel Ferrara's \"The Gladiator\" (1987) and as Patricia Wilson-Gardner in \"Poltergeist III\" (1988) opposite Tom Skerritt, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Heather O'Rourke, who died before production was completed. Allen reprised her role as Officer Lewis in \"RoboCop 2\" (1990) alongside Weller. To make her character tougher and more involved in the physical action, she studied martial arts and participated in police training. She recalled the filming of \"RoboCop 2\" as unpleasant, however, and later referred to director Irvin Kershner as a \"miserable human being.\" That same year, Allen top-lined Richard Martini's \"Limit Up\". As commodities trader Casey Falls, Allen showcased her comedic abilities. The lighthearted romp also featured Danitra Vance and blues icon Ray Charles. In 1990, Allen also had the distinction of starring in the first ever original film made for the Lifetime television network, the highly rated \"Memories of Murder\".\n\nShe married comedian Craig Shoemaker on September 6, 1992. Allen played Officer Lewis a third time in \"RoboCop 3\" (1993) and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. For her third performance as the feisty cop, she worked to soften the usually tough-as-nails demeanor of the character: \"You do your job and you become more confident with yourself. Therefore, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone and basically deny your womanhood. (It's) not a dirty word. It's actually an asset. And that's what I wanted to show – to loosen her up in that way.\" The same year, Allen also appeared with Linda Fiorentino in \"Acting on Impulse\". She and Shoemaker eventually divorced in 1994.\n\nAllen has appeared in a number of documentaries about her most famous films, including \"Dressed to Kill\", \"Carrie\", \"Blow Out\", the \"RoboCop\" trilogy, and \"Poltergeist III\".\n\nIn 1994, she re-teamed with \"Strange Invaders\" writer Bill Condon to star as psychic Jessie Gallardo opposite Roger Moore in the movie of the week \"The Man Who Wouldn't Die\". She also had a supporting part in the French drama film \"Les patriotes\" (1994). In 1995, she starred in a Broadway production of the play \"Dial M For Murder\" by Frederick Knott, which had been the basis for the film of the same name. It starred John James as Tony Wendice, Nancy Allen as Margot and Roddy McDowall as Inspector Hubbard. It was run from September 26, 1995, to March 10, 1996, and directed by Edward Hastings. She starred as Linda Savage in \"Quality Time\" in 1997, but the film was not released until 2008 due, in part, to post-production and renamed \"My Apocalypse\". She and builder/contractor Randy Bailey were married in June 1998.\n\nAllen had a small but notable role as Midge in the crime thriller \"Out of Sight\" (1998) starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh.

Depending on the schedule of the various state and local programs, young women are eligible during the summer preceding their senior year in high school. This program is designed to provide young women with the opportunity and support needed to succeed before, during, and after attending college. In addition, through the Distinguished Young Women Life Skills program, which includes workshops and online resources, participants can learn skills like interviewing, public speaking, self-confidence building and much more. Since its creation in 1958, over 700,000 young ladies have participated in competitions spanning the United States. Participants compete in the categories of Interview (25%), Scholastics (25%), Talent (20%), Fitness (15%), and Self-Expression (15%). Each state hosts a state program in which the chosen representative advances to the national program, held in the program's birthplace of Mobile, Alabama. Each year the Distinguished Young Women program gives out over $1 billion dollars in scholarships. The Distinguished Young Women program is free to enter.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Mobile's Junior Chamber of Commerce, known today as the Jaycees, began the earliest form of the Junior Miss program as an annual floral pageant in the spring to encourage participation from residents in local beautification projects, including azalea flowers. The winner of the pageant would eventually choose her successor to carry on the role of representing the annual program: an act similar to what every America's Junior Miss has done a year after winning the title, but it's the judges who decide first.\n\nShortly after the Second World War, the Junior Chamber changed the program especially for young high school juniors to participate. Prizes included the honor of being queen of the Azalea Trail Maids, Mobile's official hostesses at special events. Before 1957, the Junior Chamber realized that not only were Mobilians participating in their program, so were Mississippi and Florida residents. It was decided that year to make the program national, allowing high school seniors from every state to participate in the renamed America's Junior Miss. Unlike the Miss America pageant which started as a beauty pageant, but now includes judging on Evening Gown, Private 12 Minute Interview, On Stage Q & A, and Swimsuit, America's Junior Miss has always been a scholarship program. America's Junior Miss participants were required to be seniors in high school and were judged on scholastic achievement, creative and performing arts, physical fitness, poise and appearance, and a judges' interview. Bathing suits were never a part of the America's Junior Miss.\n\nThe first national finals were held in March 1958 at the Saenger Theater in downtown Mobile, with 18 states represented. Phyllis Whitenack of West Virginia won $5000 in scholarship money, along with the title of America's Junior Miss.\n\nIn 1963, all 50 states had their own Junior Miss in the national finals. The 1960s was a decade of excellence for the America's Junior Miss program, with new sponsors such as Kodak and Chevrolet, the program was able to continue increasing scholarship beyond $24,000 and bring Mobile's annual event before the eyes of network television viewers regularly for 23 years starting in 1965. Among the entertainers invited to perform at the finals early in the Sixties was Eddie Fisher. In this decade, two holders of the Junior Miss title would soon lead successful careers while supporting the organization that helped them along the way. Missouri Junior Miss and America's Junior Miss 1961 Mary Frann would one day appear on TV programs such as \"Newhart\" and numerous variety shows in her acting career. Frann help founded the alumni organization America's Junior Miss Council in 1995. Kentucky Junior Miss and America's Junior Miss 1963 Diane Sawyer continued to support the program as her career in journalism continued, which led to a position at the ABC Television Network program \"Good Morning America\" and most recently to be the second woman to individually hold the anchor chair nationally for a nightly news program World News on ABC television (Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Vargas and Connie Chung co-anchored with male counterparts).\n\nThe New Seekers appeared at the May 1973 finals, hosted by Ed McMahon. Actor Michael Landon would host the national finals for the first time in 1974, his first out of seven appearances. Also in 1974, Donna Alexander of New Jersey, became the first black female to reach this point of the competition. Alumni from this decade include America's Junior Miss 1973 Linda Rutledge Delbridge of Kansas, who would one day become a computer scientist and executive for IBM. Georgia Junior Miss 1976 Deborah Norville followed a journalism career path that would earn her the job of hosting the syndicated news program \"Inside Edition\". Maryland Junior Miss 1971 was Kathie Lee Gifford, who would one day host a syndicated talk show with TV personality Regis Philbin. In spite of never advancing to the 1971 finals, Georgia contender Kim Basinger would later have an acting career that would lead her to an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the movie \"L.A. Confidential\". Before becoming a Tony Award winning producer, Bonnie Comley, won the talent competition in the Junior Miss Massachusetts program in 1977.\n\nAndy Gibb performed for the audience and the Junior Misses participating at the 1980 national finals. One year later, the format known as \"theater in the round\" was introduced for the finals and its television broadcasts. Mary Frann returned for the finals in 1985 to co-host with Bruce Jenner. The outreach program \"Be Your Best Self\" became the official platform of the America's Junior Miss program in 1987, when Wisconsin's Junior Miss Chuti Tiu became the first non-Caucasian national winner. America's Junior Miss 1980 Julie Bryan Moran hosted the finals in 1988, the program's final time as a yearly event on a major television network. The national finals were moved from the Mobile Civic Center arena to the theater section in 1989. Among the Junior Miss participants in this decade who would become well known were Georgia's Julie Moran, who would anchor the syndicated TV program \"Entertainment Tonight\" and 1986 Junior Miss Debra Messing of Rhode Island, whose acting career led to earning one of the leading roles in the sitcom \"Will & Grace\". At the end of the Eighties, the name of the program was changed to \"America's Young Woman of the Year\" to renew interest, but it was later realized that this new identity was unlike the long established brand of America's Junior Miss that interested many participants. The name \"America's Junior Miss\" would be restored in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, the America's Junior Miss finals once again became a national event on television. One of the guests this time was actor Brian Austin Green of the TV series \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". One year later, the NBC Television Network stopped televising the finals. The judging criteria for the local and national levels of the program would be revamped in 1995. With help from David G. Bronner of the Retirement Systems of Alabama and Raycom Media, viewers got to see Alabama's Junior Miss Tyrenda Williams become the first black America's Junior Miss in 1997 and earn $30,000 in scholarship out of a total of $97,500 for the winners. The number of stations airing the national finals would increase from 50 to 177 in 1998. The 1999 finals, hosted by 1976 Junior Miss Deborah Norville aired tape-delayed on The Nashville Network, which would air the event live in 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn 2000, for the first time ever, a scholarship of $50,000 was the top prize and Utah Junior Miss Jesika Henderson earned it along with the title of America's Junior Miss that year. Both Deborah Norville and Karen Morris Gowdy took part in the 2001 finals, with Norville hosting the finals and Gowdy handling the preliminary round. Singer Toby Keith provided entertainment for the finals. Dan Marino joined Norville for the finals in 2002, which aired nationally on the PAX TV network. Billy Gilman and 3rd Faze were also part of the 2002 finals. The 2004 finals were a little different from previous years, as the 50 Junior Misses were taped for documentary segments spanning their two weeks of preparation.\n\nIn 2005, the AJM Board of Directors' executive committee was unsuccessful at retaining sponsors and a major television network willing enough to broadcast the national finals. The Board of Directors had no choice but to make the 2005 national finals on June 25 possibly the very last for America's Junior Miss. After Mississippi's Junior Miss Kelli Lynn Schutz was chosen and given a $50,000 scholarship, she was not originally scheduled for any of the traditional AJM appearances. The 2005 finals, hosted by 2000 America's Junior Miss Jesika Henderson and actor Nicky Brown, airing live on the Mobile CBS affiliate WKRG-TV and pre-recorded for PAX TV on June 27 was a celebration of all 48 years of accomplishing a feat that no other organization similar to AJM would attempt: prepare and encourage the lives of young women beginning to enter a new world of possibility.\n\nThe organization had originally set a date of September 30, 2005 to end operations. A group of concerned Junior Miss supporters, under the band of Friends of AJM and with the website saveajm.org, fought for the continuation of the program. On August 9 the board of directors decided that the national finals should continue to be held in Mobile, only without any national television coverage as part of the new budget.\n\nThrough the efforts of Junior Miss supporters across the country, America's Junior Miss continued operations from the national headquarters in Mobile. The board of directors hired Becky Jo Peterson, formerly chair of the California Junior Miss program, as the new executive director. In June 2006, 50 state Junior Misses spent two weeks in Mobile, Alabama, for the 49th annual national finals where Kentucky's Junior Miss Taylor Phillips was chosen as the new America's Junior Miss. More than $100,000 in scholarships were awarded at the national finals to the class of 2006.\n\n2007 marked the 50th anniversary of America's Junior Miss. The national finals were held June 28–30 at the Mobile Civic Center Theater in Mobile, where more than $150,000 in scholarships were awarded.\n\nIt was announced on June 26, 2010 that America's Junior Miss would now be renamed Distinguished Young Women. This change was intended in part to help differentiate the program from pageants. Idaho's Madison Denise Leonard was named America's first Distinguished Young Woman.\nTennessee's Katye Brock was Named America's 2011 Distinguished Young Woman. Christina Maxwell of Asheville, North Carolina was named Distinguished Young Woman of America for 2012. Nicole Renard of Washington State was named Distinguished Young Woman of America for 2013. Brooke Rucker of Georgia was the Distinguished Young Woman of America for 2014. On June 27, 2015, Alaska's Máire Nakada was named the Distinguished Young Woman of America for 2015. In 2016, Tara Moore of South Carolina was named Distinguished Young Woman of America. The next year saw Skye Bork of DC named Distinguished Young Woman of 2017. On June 30, 2018, Aaryan Morrison from Kokomo, Indiana was named Distinguished Young Woman of 2018.\n\nThere have been no winners from the following states: \n\n"}

The argument for \"Urtzi\" being a Basque sky god is based on two main arguments.\n\nThe first main argument is that Basque has numerous calendric and meteorological terms which contain forms of the root \"ortzi\" (with the variants \"urtz\", \"ortz\", \"orz\" and \"ost\"), for example:\n\nThis has led to a popular modern interpretation of Urtzi as a sky god. It should also be mentioned that the modern Basque word for sky, \"zeru\", is a loanword from Latin \"caelum\" and that the word \"urtzi\" or \"ortzi\" is not productive anymore.\n\nThe second argument is based on the 12th-century account, the Codex Calixtinus, of Aymeric Picaud, a French pilgrim, who recorded a number of Basque words and expressions. He wrote about Urtzi: \"et Deus uocant Urcia\" (\"and they name God as Urcia\".) Since the remaining material Picaud recorded appears to be very accurate, this bears some weight.\n\nHowever, there are no legends at all related to such a god and Picaud remains the only explicit reference to date. This had led to the alternative theory that this may have been a generic term for 'sky' and that Picaud may have simply \"pointed at the sky\" looking for the word for God and been supplied the word for 'sky.' This explanation is to some degree supported by the unexpected absolutive case ending \"-a\" in \"Urcia\", which neither in Proto-Basque or modern Basque appears on proper nouns.

One of his best-known onstage performances was in \"Sordid Lives\", where he played Earl \"Brother Boy\" Ingram, a role he took to the big screen in the popular cult film of the same name.\n\nLeslie Jordan was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In a 2014 interview, Jordan said that he had a difficult time growing up Southern Baptist. \"I was baptized 14 times. Every time the preacher would say, 'Come forward, sinners!' I’d say 'Oooh, I was out in the woods with that boy, I better go forward.'\"\n\nDuring an appearance on\" Today\" with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, Jordan discussed his personal life and career. He described his mother, Peggy Ann, as being supportive and accepting though never truly understanding him. When asked about his mother, he said she lives in Chattanooga and is a private woman. Jordan's father was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army and died in a plane crash when Jordan was 11 years old.\n\nJordan moved to Los Angeles in 1982 where he became involved with drugs and alcohol and was arrested several times. When Jordan was 17 years old, he began to journal daily, which helped him recover from drug and alcohol abuse. In 2010, Jordan told talk show host Wendy Williams that he had been sober for thirteen years. In the same appearance Jordan said that before he gave up drinking, he once shared a cell with Robert Downey Jr., and when they both appeared later on \"Ally McBeal\", Downey couldn't quite place where they had met before.\n\nEarly in the AIDS crisis, Jordan became involved in AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) as a buddy and as a food delivery person for Project Angel Food.\n\nJordan is recognized for his diminutive size and Southern drawl.

{"id": "2017338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017338", "title": "Recursive least squares filter", "text": "Recursive least squares filter\n\nRecursive least squares (RLS) is an adaptive filter algorithm that recursively finds the coefficients that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the input signals. This approach is in contrast to other algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) that aim to reduce the mean square error. In the derivation of the RLS, the input signals are considered deterministic, while for the LMS and similar algorithm they are considered stochastic. Compared to most of its competitors, the RLS exhibits extremely fast convergence. However, this benefit comes at the cost of high computational complexity.\n\nRLS was discovered by Gauss but lay unused or ignored until 1950 when Plackett rediscovered the original work of Gauss from 1821. In general, the RLS can be used to solve any problem that can be solved by adaptive filters. For example, suppose that a signal formula_1 is transmitted over an echoey, noisy channel that causes it to be received as\n\nwhere formula_3 represents additive noise. The intent of the RLS filter is to recover the desired signal formula_1 by use of a formula_5-tap FIR filter, formula_6:\n\nwhere formula_8 is the column vector containing the formula_5 most recent samples of formula_10. The estimate of the recovered desired signal is\n\nThe goal is to estimate the parameters of the filter formula_6, and at each time formula_13 we refer to the current estimate as formula_14 and the adapted least-squares estimate by formula_15. formula_14 is also a column vector, as shown below, and the transpose, formula_17, is a row vector. The matrix product formula_18 (which is the dot product of formula_14 and formula_20) is formula_21, a scalar. The estimate is \"\"good\"\" if formula_22 is small in magnitude in some least squares sense. \n\nAs time evolves, it is desired to avoid completely redoing the least squares algorithm to find the new estimate for formula_15, in terms of formula_14.\n\nThe benefit of the RLS algorithm is that there is no need to invert matrices, thereby saving computational cost. Another advantage is that it provides intuition behind such results as the Kalman filter.\n\nThe idea behind RLS filters is to minimize a cost function formula_25 by appropriately selecting the filter coefficients formula_14, updating the filter as new data arrives. The error signal formula_27 and desired signal formula_1 are defined in the negative feedback diagram below:\n\nThe error implicitly depends on the filter coefficients through the estimate formula_21:\n\nThe weighted least squares error function formula_25—the cost function we desire to minimize—being a function of formula_27 is therefore also dependent on the filter coefficients:\nwhere formula_34 is the \"forgetting factor\" which gives exponentially less weight to older error samples.\n\nThe cost function is minimized by taking the partial derivatives for all entries formula_35 of the coefficient vector formula_36 and setting the results to zero\nNext, replace formula_27 with the definition of the error signal\nRearranging the equation yields\nThis form can be expressed in terms of matrices\nwhere formula_42 is the weighted sample covariance matrix for formula_10, and formula_44 is the equivalent estimate for the cross-covariance between formula_1 and formula_10. Based on this expression we find the coefficients which minimize the cost function as\nThis is the main result of the discussion.\n\nThe smaller formula_48 is, the smaller is the contribution of previous samples to the covariance matrix. This makes the filter \"more\" sensitive to recent samples, which means more fluctuations in the filter co-efficients. The formula_50 case is referred to as the \"growing window RLS algorithm\". In practice, formula_48 is usually chosen between 0.98 and 1. By using type-II maximum likelihood estimation the optimal formula_48 can be estimated from a set of data.\nThe discussion resulted in a single equation to determine a coefficient vector which minimizes the cost function. In this section we want to derive a recursive solution of the form\nwhere formula_54 is a correction factor at time formula_55. We start the derivation of the recursive algorithm by expressing the cross covariance formula_44 in terms of formula_57\nwhere formula_58 is the formula_59 dimensional data vector\nSimilarly we express formula_42 in terms of formula_62 by\nIn order to generate the coefficient vector we are interested in the inverse of the deterministic auto-covariance matrix. For that task the Woodbury matrix identity comes in handy. With\nThe Woodbury matrix identity follows\nTo come in line with the standard literature, we define\nwhere the \"gain vector\" formula_63 is\nBefore we move on, it is necessary to bring formula_64 into another form\nSubtracting the second term on the left side yields\nWith the recursive definition of formula_65 the desired form follows\nNow we are ready to complete the recursion. As discussed\nThe second step follows from the recursive definition of formula_67. Next we incorporate the recursive definition of formula_65 together with the alternate form of formula_64 and get\nWith formula_70 we arrive at the update equation\nwhere formula_71\nis the \"a priori\" error. Compare this with the \"a posteriori\" error; the error calculated \"after\" the filter is updated:\n\nThat means we found the correction factor\n\nThis intuitively satisfying result indicates that the correction factor is directly proportional to both the error and the gain vector, which controls how much sensitivity is desired, through the weighting factor, formula_48.\n\nThe RLS algorithm for a \"p\"-th order RLS filter can be summarized as\nThe recursion for formula_75 follows an Algebraic Riccati equation and thus draws parallels to the Kalman filter.\n\nThe Lattice Recursive Least Squares adaptive filter is related to the standard RLS except that it requires fewer arithmetic operations (order N). It offers additional advantages over conventional LMS algorithms such as faster convergence rates, modular structure, and insensitivity to variations in eigenvalue spread of the input correlation matrix. The LRLS algorithm described is based on \"a posteriori\" errors and includes the normalized form. The derivation is similar to the standard RLS algorithm and is based on the definition of formula_76. In the forward prediction case, we have formula_77 with the input signal formula_78 as the most up to date sample. The backward prediction case is formula_79, where i is the index of the sample in the past we want to predict, and the input signal formula_80 is the most recent sample.\n\nThe algorithm for a LRLS filter can be summarized as\nThe normalized form of the LRLS has fewer recursions and variables. It can be calculated by applying a normalization to the internal variables of the algorithm which will keep their magnitude bounded by one. This is generally not used in real-time applications because of the number of division and square-root operations which comes with a high computational load.\n\nThe algorithm for a NLRLS filter can be summarized as\n\n"}

{"id": "2017360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017360", "title": "WIS (TV)", "text": "WIS (TV)\n\nWIS, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is a dual NBC/CW-affiliated television station licensed to Columbia, South Carolina, United States. The station is owned by Gray Television. WIS' studios are located on Bull and Gervais Streets (US 1/US 378) in downtown Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Rush Road (southeast of I-20) in rural southwestern Kershaw County, outside Lugoff. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 3 in both standard and high definition.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 7, 1953. The station's first telecast was a college football game between the University of South Carolina and the University of North Carolina. The station was originally owned by the Broadcasting Company of the South, a subsidiary of the Liberty Life Insurance Company, owners of WIS radio (560 AM, now WVOC). Charles Batson signed the station on the air, and remained the station's president and general manager until his retirement in 1983. It was the fourth television station to sign on in South Carolina and the third in the Columbia market, signing on just four months after WCOS-TV (channel 25)—which ceased operations in 1956—and two months after WNOK-TV (channel 67, now WLTX on channel 19, where it moved in 1961). WIS is the third-longest continuously operating station in the state, behind WCSC-TV in Charleston and WNOK/WLTX.\n\nWIS radio (whose call letters stood for \"Wonderful Iodine State,\" in reference to the abundance of iodine in the South Carolina soil) received the last new three-letter call sign in the U.S. on January 23, 1930, and the call sign was later shared with its television sibling. The station has been an NBC affiliate since its sign-on, owing to its radio sister's longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network. However, until 1961, when channel 25 returned to the air as WCCA-TV (now WOLO-TV), it maintained a secondary affiliation with ABC, airing its programming outside of NBC network timeslots.\n\nWIS-TV was a major beneficiary of an exception to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s \"2½ + 1\" plan for allocating VHF television bandwidth. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve VHF channels available, and 69 UHF channels (which was later reduced to 56 with the removal of high-band channels 70-83 in the early 1980s). The VHF bands were more desirable because signals broadcasting on that band traveled a longer distance. Because there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced. With the release of the FCC's \"Sixth Report and Order\" in 1952, the Commission outlined a new allocation table for VHF licenses and opened up the UHF band. Through these initiatives, almost all of the United States would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one non-commercial allocation. Most of the rest of the country (\"1/2\") would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas of the country would be designated as \"UHF islands,\" since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The \"2\" networks became CBS and NBC, \"+1\" represented non-commercial educational (public television, usually affiliated with NET) stations, and \"1/2\" became ABC, which, as the smallest and weakest network then, usually wound up with the UHF allocation where no VHF allocation was available.\n\nHowever, Columbia was sandwiched between Charlotte (which had respectively been awarded channels 3 and 9) to the north, Florence–Myrtle Beach (channel 8, later 13) to the east, Charleston (channels 2, 4, 5, and 7) and Savannah (channels 3, 9, and 11) to the south, Augusta (channels 6 and 12) to the west, and Greenville–Spartanburg–Asheville (channels 4, 7, and 13) to the northwest. This created a huge \"doughnut\" in central South Carolina where there could be only \"one\" VHF license. WIS-TV was fortunate to gain that license, providing many people in that part of South Carolina with their first clear reception of a television signal. One of the country's most dominant television stations, it has been the far-and-away market leader for most of its history.\n\nChannel 10 originally broadcast from a self-supporting tower atop its studios on Bull Street. In 1959, WIS-TV activated its current transmitter tower in Lugoff; the tallest structure located east of the Mississippi River at the time, it more than doubled the station's coverage area and provided at least secondary coverage as far north as Charlotte, as far south as Augusta, as far west as Greenwood and as far east as Florence. This included all but five of the state's 46 counties; in fact, until the arrival of cable television in the market in the late 1970s, channel 10 was one of only two stations that brought a clear signal to much of the outlying portions of the market—the other being WRLK-TV (channel 32), one of the two South Carolina Educational Television stations that serve the area. It would remain the tallest structure in South Carolina until Florence's WPDE-TV activated its signal in 1981. The station's original tower is still used as a backup; it is a longtime fixture of Columbia's skyline and is turned into a \"Christmas tree of lights\" during the holiday season.\n\nFor many years, WIS was one of two NBC affiliates that served the Florence–Myrtle Beach market, since that market was one of the few areas on the East Coast without its own NBC affiliate. It was the NBC affiliate of record for the Pee Dee (Florence) side of the market while Wilmington's WECT was the affiliate of record for Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand. However, most cable systems on the Myrtle Beach side of the market began carrying WIS in the mid-1980s. After the FCC passed the syndication exclusivity rule in 1989, WIS set up a \"virtual station\" for cable systems in the Florence–Myrtle Beach market that aired separate syndicated programming for the area. It also began selling advertising specific to the market as well, mostly on the Pee Dee side. This ended when Raycom Media signed on an NBC affiliate within that market, WMBF-TV, in August 2008.\n\nWIS had modest viewership on the South Carolina side of the Charlotte market for several years, especially after that city's NBC affiliation moved to WRET (channel 36, later WPCQ-TV and now WCNC-TV) in 1978. WRET's UHF signal did not have nearly as much penetration as the VHF signal of former NBC affiliate WSOC-TV (channel 9). WIS was carried on many cable systems on the South Carolina side of the Charlotte market well into the 21st century. A similar situation prevailed in Augusta, where WIS provided a stronger signal than WATU/WAGT (channel 26, now defunct). It remained on most Augusta-area cable systems, including in Augusta itself, well into the new millennium.\n\nThe Broadcasting Company of the South acquired several other television stations over the years. It was renamed as the Cosmos Broadcasting Corporation in 1965, with WIS radio and television serving as its flagship stations. Later in the decade, Liberty Life reorganized itself as the Liberty Corporation, with Liberty Life and Cosmos as subsidiaries. Cosmos sold WIS radio in 1986, but kept the WIS calls for channel 10. Liberty sold off its insurance businesses in 2000, bringing channel 10 directly under the Liberty Corporation banner. In 1991, after being known on-air as \"TV 10\" for most of its history, the station began branding itself as simply \"WIS\" (this was one year before the \"-TV\" suffix was officially dropped from its callsign); this lasted until 2003, when it branded as \"WIS News 10\" for both general and newscast branding purposes.\n\nOn August 25, 2005, Liberty agreed to merge with Montgomery, Alabama-based Raycom Media. At the time, Raycom had already owned Fox affiliate WACH (channel 57). Raycom could not keep both stations as FCC duopoly rules forbid common ownership of two of the four highest-rated television stations in a single market based on Nielsen total-day ratings data for a given calendar month. Additionally, Columbia has only eight full-power stations, one fewer than what ownership rules allow to legally permit a duopoly in any case. Raycom opted to keep WIS and sold WACH to Barrington Broadcasting.\n\nIn February 2003, the station signed on its digital signal, becoming the last \"Big Three\"-affiliated station in the Columbia market to broadcast a digital signal (after WLTX, which signed on its digital signal in May 2002, and WOLO, which signed on theirs later that year). WIS' broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009. For a week after the transition, some viewers lost access to NBC programming because WIS used its backup transmitter, which was not operating at full power. The station signed on a full-time digital transmitter from its Lugoff tower on June 19.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WIS), and Gray's 93 television stations) under Gray's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion – in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – will result in WIS gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including CBS affiliate WRDW-TV and NBC affiliate WAGT-CD in Augusta (while separating it from WFXG) in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nOn May 29, 2019, Gray announced that WIS' second digital subchannel would become Columbia's CW affiliate effective September 30, 2019, with \"Columbia's CW\" replacing WKTC (channel 63). As part of the new affiliation, Bounce TV was moved to WIS-DT3, with Grit moving to WKTC-DT7.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWIS is carried on cable systems as far southwest as Aiken and as far northeast as Wadesboro, North Carolina. Until late 2009 or early 2010, it had been available on cable in Augusta, Georgia, despite the presence of an in-market NBC affiliate, WAGT. Even though WIS is carried in Wadesboro, Charlotte NBC affiliate WCNC-TV operates a translator in nearby Lilesville, W24AY, which covers Wadesboro. WIS' analog signal tended to be more receivable along the US 74 corridor between Wadesboro and Rockingham than the Lilesville translator. Until August 8, 2008, WIS was carried on digital cable in Rowland and Laurinburg, North Carolina. On that date, WMBF-TV signed on as the NBC affiliate for the Myrtle Beach-Florence market. DirecTV customers in Scotland and Robeson Counties in North Carolina received WIS as the default NBC station instead of WECT in nearby Wilmington. For many years, WECT has served this area, especially the town of Lumberton. Metrocast Cable (formerly Northland Cable)'s system in Bennettsville was one of the few providers in the Florence/Myrtle Beach/Lumberton market that did not drop WIS; it has since been dropped by that system also. Just outside that market, WIS remains on cable providers in many areas around South Carolina such as Georgetown and Williamsburg counties.\n\nWhen CATV was first introduced in the area in the 1970s, WIS was carried in many border counties in North Carolina such as Mecklenburg, Richmond, southern Moore, Scotland, Robeson and Columbus counties. Of these areas, WIS only remains available in the Anson County town of Wadesboro. In Georgia, the station was formerly carried in the Screven County town of Sylvania.\n\nWIS airs the entire NBC network schedule except it preempts the third hour of the \"Today Show\" for their own newscast, \"WIS Today\"; however as with most NBC affiliates, the station occasionally airs one hour of its \"The More You Know\" block on Saturday mornings prior to the station's weekend morning newscast in the event that NBC schedules a sports event during the noon hour on that day. Syndicated programs broadcast by WIS include \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Right This Minute\".\n\nOver the years, channel 10 preempted NBC programming in moderation—most notably, the soap opera \"Search for Tomorrow\" during its NBC tenure from 1982 to 1986. Although NBC has historically been far less tolerant of programming preemptions than the other networks, it was more than satisfied with WIS, which was one of its strongest affiliates. Although WIS broadcasts on a 24-hour schedule, the station is one of the few remaining U.S. television stations that continues to sign off during the overnight hours for reasons other than necessary transmitter maintenance, occurring annually during the early morning hours of Christmas Day.\n\nIn 1963, the station debuted a long-running children's program \"Mr. Knozit\", which was hosted by weather anchor Joe Pinner, who had been hired by WIS-TV a few months before. Four years later, the series would receive a Peabody Award for excellence in public service by way of children's programming. The show ran for 37 years, airing its final episode in 2000. Pinner, known in his later years as \"Papa Joe,\" went into semi-retirement in 2000, but continued to provide weather reports and feature segments on the Friday edition of its noon newscast. He retired for good on September 1, 2018 after 55 years at the station.\n\nWIS maintains the local rights to the highlight program from the South Carolina State Bulldogs (which it airs on Sunday mornings during the college football season); it had held rights to the South Carolina Gamecocks coach's show until the University of South Carolina decided to move the program to regional sports network Fox Sports Carolinas. After the Gamecocks' joined the Southeastern Conference, WIS obtained the local television rights to Southeastern Conference football and men's basketball games (which made the station the home of the South Carolina Gamecocks); WOLO-TV (channel 25) and WKTC (channel 63) assumed rights to the games starting with the conference's 2010–11 athletic season.\n\nWIS presently broadcasts 37½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays); in addition, the station produces the public affairs program \"Awareness\", which airs Sunday mornings at 11:00. WIS is a partner in the Raycom News Network, a system designed to rapidly share information on-air and online among Raycom's and Meredith Corporation's widespread groups of television stations. In South Carolina, the company developed a regional network between WIS, WMBF, WCSC-TV in Charleston, WBTV in Charlotte and WHNS-TV in Greenville, in which stations share information, equipment such as satellite trucks and stories filed by the stations. Between them, these five stations cover almost all of South Carolina. Wilmington's WECT and Savannah's WTOC-TV also play a small part in the regional network.\n\nFor the better part of channel 10's history, its newscasts have dominated the ratings in Columbia. Its dominance was helped by the fact that it was the only VHF station in the market. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s, it was the only station in the market that offered a full schedule of local newscasts in all four dayparts (morning, midday, early and late evening). While WIS still leads overall, its dominance is not as absolute as it once was. In recent years, it has consistently lost the #1 ranking in the noon timeslot to WLTX (mainly because of that station's CBS Daytime programming lead-in), and the early morning ratings crown has switched between the two stations multiple times.\n\nWIS has won numerous awards for station quality and its news productions, including the Southeast Emmy Award for Best Newscast, the Edward R. Murrow Award, and several of the South Carolina Broadcasters Association's \"Best Station of the Year\" designation. In August 2007, Craig Melvin was named \"Anchor of the Year\" by SCBA. The station's on-air staff are named in the Best of the Media awards by the \"Columbia Free Times\", and the station has been voted the \"Best\" by readers of \"The State\" newspaper several times.\n\nCosmos/Liberty made it a point to pour significant resources into its stations' news departments from the 1950s onward. This resulted in a higher-quality product than conventional wisdom would suggest for a market of Columbia's size. Although Columbia was the state's largest city for most of the 20th century and well into the new millennium, it has always been a small-to-medium-sized market because the surrounding suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city itself. The station took full advantage of its near-statewide coverage to establish a tradition for strong local news coverage that continues today.\n\nAnother factor behind WIS' long dominance has been talent continuity. These staffers included news anchors Ed Carter and Susan Audé, who gained notoriety for her accomplishments as a reporter and anchor. Audé used a wheelchair due to having been paralyzed in an automobile accident. Carter became the station's main anchor in 1972, and Audé—by then known as Susan Audé Fisher (she divorced in 2000)—joined him at the anchor desk in 1982. The two remained paired together on its weekday evening newscasts until Carter retired in 1998; Audé later retired in 2006. Carter dies of COVID-19 on April 28, 2020. As mentioned above, Joe Pinner served as a weatherman and children's host at the station from 1963 until his retirement in 2018. Channel 10 continues to enjoy a staff with remarkably long tenures for a market of Columbia's size, including Jack Kuenzie, Judi Gatson, Dawndy Mercer Plank, Ben Tanner and Rick Henry, some of whom have been figures at the station for two decades.\n\nIn 1963, WIS moved its evening newscast from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., in hopes of taking advantage of having \"The Huntley-Brinkley Report\" as a lead-in. It was one of only a few stations in the Eastern Time Zone at the time to air a local newscast at 7:00 p.m. Most of Cosmos/Liberty's other stations followed WIS' lead and moved their early newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (6:00 p.m. in the case of Cosmos' stations in the Central Time Zone). It added a 6:00 p.m. newscast in 1991 as part of increased coverage of the Persian Gulf War. In 1970, WIS-TV premiered \"Awareness\", a weekly public affairs program focusing on social and political issues concerning the minority population of the Midlands. In 1996, WIS entered into a news share agreement with Fox affiliate WACH to produce a 10:00 p.m. newscast for that station, which—buoyed by WIS's ratings dominance—became one of the highest-rated prime time newscasts in the United States; the agreement ended in March 2007, when WACH launched its own news department.\n\nIn 2006, WIS built a new set for its newscasts in preparation to an upgrade to high definition; the new set debuted in January 2007. On November 4, 2010, WIS became the second television station in the Columbia market (after WOLO) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. With the upgrade, the set received a refresh and a modified graphics package was introduced; the station also changed its weather branding to \"First Alert Weather\". On June 16, 2013, WIS expanded its news programming on weekend mornings with the debut of the market's first Sunday morning newscast, airing at 10:00 a.m.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2017369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017369", "title": "Freeman (Colonial)", "text": "Freeman (Colonial)\n\nDuring the American colonial period, a freeman was a person who was not a slave. The term originated in 12th-century Europe.\n\nIn the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a man had to be a member of the Church to be a freeman; in neighboring Plymouth Colony a man did not need to be a member of the Church, but he had to be elected to this privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the right to vote, and in Plymouth only freemen could vote by 1632.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" (9th edition) defines Freeman as follows:\n\n1. A person who possesses and enjoys all the civil and political rights belonging to the people under a free government.\n\n2. A person who is not a slave.\n\n3. Hist. A member of a municipal corporation (a city or a borough) who possesses full civic rights, esp. the right to vote.\n\n4. Hist. A freeholder. Cf. VILLEIN. 5. Hist. An allodial landowner. Cf. VASSAL. - also written free man.\n\n\"Freedom\" was earned after an allotted time, or after the person demanding \"payment\" was satisfied. This was known as indentured servitude, and was not originally intended as a stigma or embarrassment for the person involved; many of the sons and daughters of the wealthy and famous of the time found themselves forced into such temporary servitude, Gary Nash reporting that \"many of the servants were actually nephews, nieces, cousins and children of friends of emigrating Englishmen, who paid their passage in return for their labor once in America.\"\n\nAn indentured servant would sign a contract agreeing to serve for a specific number of years, typically five or seven. Many immigrants to the colonies came as indentured servants, with someone else paying their passage to the Colonies in return for a promise of service. At the end of his service, according to the contract, the indentured servant usually would be granted a sum of money, a new suit of clothes, land, or perhaps passage back to England. An indentured servant was not the same as an apprentice or a child who was \"placed out.\"\n\nOnce a man was made a freeman and was no longer considered a common, he could become a member of the church (and would usually do so) and he could own land. The amount of land that he was able to own was sometimes determined by how many members there were in his family. As a freeman, he became a member of the governing body, which met in annual or semiannual meetings (town meetings) to make and enforce laws and pass judgment in civil and criminal matters. As the colonies grew, these meetings became impractical and a representative bicameral system was developed. Freemen would choose deputy governors who made up the upper house of the General Court, and assistant governors who made up the lower house, who chose the governor from among their ranks and passed judgments in civil and criminal matters. To hold one of these offices it was required, of course, for one to be a freeman. Thus, the enfranchised voters and office holders were landholding male church members. Non-Puritans were not made freeman.\n\nInitially, a male was not formally considered free when first entering into a colony, or just recently having become a member of one of the local churches; he was considered common. Such persons were never forced to work for another individual, per se, but their movements were carefully observed, and if they veered from the Puritan ideal, they were asked to leave the colony. There was an unstated probationary period, usually one to two years, that the prospective \"freeman\" needed to go through, and he was allowed his freedom if he did pass this probationary period of time. A Freeman was said to be free of all debt, owing nothing to anyone except God Himself.\n\nA \"free planter\" (as opposed to a \"freeman\") was any land holder who possessed land outright that was usually given to him by the colony after he had finished his probationary period, except in those cases where the land owner had inherited his property. But if he was deemed legally incompetent, didn't pass his probationary period, or again lost his freedom through some irresponsibility of his own, he would have his land and property confiscated and redistributed among the remaining freemen, even if the inheritor was a well-respected citizen.\n\nInitially, all persons seeking to be free needed to take the \"Oath of a Freeman\", in which they vowed to defend the Commonwealth and not to conspire to overthrow the government. The first handwritten version of the \"Freeman's Oath\" was made in 1634; it was printed by Stephen Daye in 1639 in the form of a broadside or single sheet of paper intended for posting in public places.\n"}

It was placed at number forty-nine on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Album Covers.\n\nThe tracks \"A Carrot is as Close as a Rabbit Gets to a Diamond\", \"Flavor Bud Living\" and \"Brickbats\" were originally intended and recorded for the proposed album \"Bat Chain Puller\" but it wasn't released due to Frank Zappa owning the master tapes as DiscReet cofounders Herb Cohen and Zappa feuded over the production of the album, because Cohen funded the production with Zappa's royalty checks.\n\nFormer drummer of the Magic Band John French plays slide guitar and guitar on the album, bass on \"Sheriff of Hong Kong\", and drums on the tracks \"Ashtray Heart\" and \"Sheriff of Hong Kong\" and marimba on \"Making Love To A Vampire With A Monkey On My Knee\".

As an amateur, McBride competed for Ireland at the 1992 Summer Olympics. He is married to Danielle Curran. The couple share two children, a daughter and son. \n\nMcBride debuted in December 1992, with a draw against Gary Charlton. In 1997, he defeated Paul Douglas to win the All-Ireland Heavyweight Title, and in 2002 he defeated Craig Tomlinson to add the IBC Americas Heavyweight Title. McBride currently resides in the heavily Irish neighbourhood of Dorchester in Boston and trains in nearby Brockton, Massachusetts.\n\nMcBride's career-defining performance was a victory over Mike Tyson, former undisputed world heavyweight champion, via a 6th-round TKO on 11 June 2005 when Tyson quit the fight by informing the referee that he would not be able to continue to round Seven in the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. The aged Tyson explained in a post fight interview that his heart wasn't into the sport any more. Tyson announced his retirement after the bout, saying \"I'm not going to disrespect the sport anymore by losing to this caliber of fighter\".\nMcBride has suffered six losses by knockout—including twice against fighters with losing records. Since his fight with Mike Tyson, McBride beat Byron Polley, then suffered three upset losses. The first loss was against Mike Mollo, a second-round knockout loss. The second loss was against Andrew Golota, a sixth-round technical knockout loss after Golota skilfully worked a cut he had opened up over McBride's eye. After three years inactivity, McBride, the 'Clones Colossus', attempted a comeback in an eight rounder on 10 July 2010 at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York, but lost every round—and the bout—in an upset to cruiserweight veteran Zack Page, a journeyman with a losing record as a professional. Despite standing and weighing 282 pounds to Page's and 205 pounds, McBride was outworked and out punched by his smaller, faster, more aggressive opponent.\n\nOn 9 April 2011 McBride fought former cruiserweight and light heavyweight world champion Tomasz Adamek for the IBF International Heavyweight and NABO Heavyweight Championship belts at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. Adamek won a 12-round unanimous decision.\n\nMcBride ended his career after losing to Mariusz Wach on 29 July 2011 during a boxing gala held at Mohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Connecticut. \n\nMcBride's nickname, \"The Clones Colossus\", recalls Barry McGuigan's sobriquet \"The Clones Cyclone\".\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2017398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017398", "title": "Michigan Wolverines", "text": "Michigan Wolverines\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines comprise 29 varsity sports teams at the University of Michigan. These teams compete in the NCAA's Division I and in the Big Ten Conference in all sports except women's water polo, which competes in the NCAA inter-divisional Collegiate Water Polo Association. Team colors are maize and blue, though these are different shades of \"maize\" and \"blue\" than those used by the university at large. The winged helmet is a recognized icon of Michigan Athletics.\n\nThe Wolverines are an athletic powerhouse nationally. In the past 13 of 20 years (through 2016–17), Michigan has finished in the top five of the NACDA Directors' Cup, a list compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. Just as impressive, UM has finished in the top ten of the Directors' Cup standings in twenty of the award's twenty-six seasons (through 2019) good for 5th best nationally. \n\nThe University of Michigan Athletic Department sponsors teams in 14 men's and 15 women's NCAA sanctioned sports.\n\nThe men's baseball team won national championships in 1953 and 1962 and has sent 138 players to the major leagues. The current coach of the Michigan Wolverines is Erik Bakich, who came to the University of Michigan after the 2012 season when Rich Maloney stepped down. Michigan has won 35 conference championships, made 22 NCAA Tournament appearances and won those 2 national titles. For 13 seasons from 1990 to 2002, Michigan won a lone Big Ten title in 1997 and made just one NCAA appearance in 1999. In 2015, Coach Bakich led the program to its first NCAA tournament berth since 2008 after needing to win the Big Ten Tournament to qualify. In 2019 the Michigan Wolverines baseball team made it to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe men's basketball team plays its games at Crisler Center. The Wolverines have won 14 Big Ten regular season titles, as well as the inaugural Big Ten Tournament in 1998, which it later forfeited due to NCAA violations. The team has appeared in the NCAA Final Four on eight occasions (1964, 1965, 1976, 1989, 1992*, 1993*, 2013, 2018) and won the National Championship in 1989 under Steve Fisher. The program later vacated its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances due to NCAA violations. Other notable players who played for Michigan include Roy Tarpley, Loy Vaught, Gary Grant, Terry Mills, Glen Rice, Jalen Rose, Rumeal Robinson, Rickey Green, Phil Hubbard, Jamal Crawford, Juwan Howard, Chris Webber, Jimmy King, Ray Jackson, Cazzie Russell, Daniel Horton, Campy Russell, and Mark Hughes.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the program became involved in a scandal involving payments from a booster named Ed Martin to four players: Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor, and Louis Bullock. The scandal ultimately resulted in four years' probation and a self-imposed ban from postseason play in the 2002–03 season. UM also voluntarily vacated regular season wins and NCAA tournament games from selected past seasons. Vacating the results of 113 games won while the four players were eligible, including the 1992 and 1993 Final Fours, the entire 1992–93 season, and all seasons from fall 1995 through spring 1999. After the scandal, Michigan men's basketball would then go 10 years without making the NCAA tournament from 1999 to 2008. They would eventually end the drought in 2009 under then-head coach John Beilein. In 2013, the program would reach its first Final Four in 20 years before falling to Louisville in the national championship, 82–76. The program reached another Final Four in 2018, its second under Beilein. The team would once again reach the championship game, but instead fall to the Villanova Wildcats men's basketball. Beilein would accept a position as the Cleveland Cavilers head coach after 12 years at Michigan. \n\nHis replacement for the following season would be alumnus Juwan Howard. \n\nMichigan traveled to St. Thomas for the Paradise Jam Tournament over Thanksgiving weekend in 2011. They took on Prairie View A&M in their first game on Thanksgiving Day, and won 59–53. In their second game, they faced Washington State and won easily, 69–39. On the final day of the tournament, they played Marquette, and won 71–51, to win the 2011 Paradise Jam (Reef Division) Championship. Jenny Ryan had a double-double, with 13 points and ten rebounds, to help Michigan to a 7–0 record on the year.\n\nThe women's basketball team is coached by Kim Barnes Arico, who became the head coach in 2012. Formerly the head coach of the St. John's Red Storm, Arico was named the Big East Conference Coach of the Year for 2012.\n\nThe men's and women's cross country teams have been nationally renowned since 1974 when Ron Warhurst started coaching the men, and more recently as alum Mike McGuire took on the women's team in 1991. The women's team has qualified for the NCAA championships every year but two since 1988, finishing 2nd in 1994, and winning five consecutive Big Ten titles from 2002 to 2006. The men's team has qualified for the NCAA 24 times in the last 34 years, with a highest finish of 4th. Michigan men have won seven Big Ten titles in that period.\n\nThe Wolverines have won a record 962 games and have the most all-time wins and the third highest winning percentage in college football history, after Boise State and Ohio State. Michigan won the inaugural Rose Bowl in 1902, the first college bowl game ever played. The Wolverine football program has claimed 11 national titles.\n\nMichigan's 11 national championships have come under the direction of five coaches. The first six were garnered by the team's first coaching superstar, Fielding H. Yost. Yost directed his \"Point-a-Minute\" teams to four consecutive national titles from 1901 to 1904, amassing a record of 41–0–1. Yost also led Michigan to national titles in 1918 and 1923. Yost was instrumental in the creation of Michigan Stadium and designed it to permit its expansion to expand to a capacity of over 150,000. Yost's legacy also lives on with Yost Ice Arena, where Michigan's men's ice hockey team plays their home games. Michigan football has won five more national titles since Yost permanently retired in 1926. The Wolverines won back-to-back titles under Harry Kipke in 1932 and 1933 and two more consecutive championships under Fritz Crisler and Bennie Oosterbaan in 1947 and 1948. Michigan won its most recent national title under Lloyd Carr in 1997.\n\nMichigan's famous football coaches include: Yost, who came to Michigan from Stanford University in 1901, Fritz Crisler, who guided Michigan to a pair of Big Ten Conference championships and the 1947 national title, has his name carried by the home of Michigan men's basketball team, Bo Schembechler won 13 Big Ten titles in his 21 seasons as head coach between 1969 and 1989, the first in 1969 when he beat his friend and mentor Woody Hayes, beginning of \"The Ten Year War\" era of the Michigan – Ohio State football rivalry, Lloyd Carr won five Big Ten titles in his 13 seasons at the helm and posted a winning percentage of .753. His winning percentage of .779 in conference play trails only that of Schembechler in Michigan history, Rich Rodriguez succeeded Carr following his retirement in 2007. Rodriguez coached the Wolverines through the 2010 season, compiling a record of 15–22. Rodriguez would be followed by coach Brady Hoke who would go onto coach four seasons. Hoke would end with a record of 31-20. Alumnus Jim Harbaugh would replace Hoke for the 2015 season. \n\nMichigan has a major rivalry with Ohio State, considered one of the fiercest rivalries in American sports. In a pair of ESPN fan polls, in 2000 and 2003, the Michigan–Ohio State series was voted the greatest rivalry in sports in America. Michigan's meeting with Ohio State is almost always the last game of the two schools' regular seasons and has provided many memorable contests, such as the \"Snow Bowl\" of 1950. The game has frequently decided the Big Ten Champion. Michigan leads the series 58–50–6. The contest on November 18, 2006 marked the first time ever these teams had been ranked No. 1 and No. 2 going into the game, and the first time they were both undefeated since 1973. The 2007 college football match-up between Ohio State and Michigan was predicted to be the No. 2 college football game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's \"Top 20 Games To Watch in 2007\" list.\n\nMichigan has a spirited rivalry with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Michigan leads the series 25–17–1. The two schools are among the top college football programs in all-time wins (Michigan first, Notre Dame fifth) and winning percentage (Michigan third, Notre Dame fourth) in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), so it is perhaps fitting that when college football was in its infancy, students from the University of Michigan traveled to South Bend to teach the game to students there.\n\nMichigan also has an intrastate rival in Michigan State; the schools' football teams compete for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan leads the series 68–34–5.\n\nThe Wolverines also have a tradition-rich history with the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The two football teams compete for the Little Brown Jug, a five-gallon jug with the respective schools' \"M\"s on either side and the scores of previous games down the middle. The Little Brown Jug was the first trophy played for between college football teams. Through 2017, Michigan leads the Brown Jug series 75–25–3.\n\nWomen's field hockey became a varsity sport at Michigan in 1973. The Wolverines field hockey team won the 2001 NCAA title, which was the school's first national title in a women's team sport. Marcia Pankratz served as the head coach of the program from 1996 to 2004 and returned to the position in 2009. The Wolverines have won a total of eight Big Ten regular season titles and five Big Ten tournaments.\n\nMen's golf has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1919. The team's first coach was elocution and oratory professor Thomas Trueblood who served as coach from 1920 to 1935. Trueblood led the Michigan golf team to consecutive national championships in 1934 and 1935. Two coaches, Bert Katzenmeyer (1947–1968) and Jim Carras (1982–2002), have had tenures of at least 20 years with the program. Andrew Sapp has been the coach since 2002. In 2009, Sapp led the team to its best record in more than 50 years with 6th-place finish at the NCAA championship finals. Chris Whitten became head coach in 2011 and led the team to a runner-up finish in 2013. Three Michigan golfers have won the individual intercollegiate golf championships: Johnny Fischer (1932), Chuck Kocsis (1936), and Dave Barclay (1947). The team has won the Big Ten Conference Championship 12 times: 1932–36, 1942–44, 1946–47, 1949, and 1952.\n\nWomen's golf has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1976. Cheryl Stacy, a former All-American golfer for Ohio State, took over as the team's head coach in 2009. In the fall of 2009, Stacy signed a trio of highly rated high school golfers from Ohio, Florida and Georgia to national letters of intent for the 2010–11 academic year.\n\nThe Michigan men's gymnastics team has won 6 NCAA championships, 17 Big Ten championships and have been invited to 32 NCAA tournaments. Newt Loken was the head coach for 36 years from 1948 to 1983, during which time he coached the Wolverines to two NCAA team gymnastics championships, two NCAA team trampoline championships, and 21 NCAA individual event championships. Since 1999, head coach Kurt Golder has led Michigan to national championships in 1999, 2010, 2013, 2014 and the Super Six at the NCAA tournament in 13 of the last 14 seasons.\n\nUntil 1969, men's trampoline was one of the events that comprised the NCAA gymnastics championships. At that time, the event was removed in order to conform to the international gymnastics itinerary. The NCAA then bestowed a separate national title in trampoline for two years, both won by Michigan.\n\nWomen's gymnastics has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1976. Bev Plocki has been the head coach of the women's gymnastics team since 1990. Under Plocki's leadership, the Wolverines have won 16 Big Ten championships, advanced to 16 consecutive NCAA tournaments (1993–2008) and had seven seasons in which they finished in the Top 5 at the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe Wolverines ice hockey team, which was a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association until 2013 and is now a member of the Big Ten Conference, plays its home contests at Yost Ice Arena. The hockey team was coached by Red Berenson, a former UM player and is currently coached by Mel Pearson. Altogether, the program has won nine NCAA national championships (1948, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1964, 1996, 1998), which is also an NCAA record. In 2011, the team was invited to the NCAA tournament for a record 21st year in a row. In 2011, Michigan reached the national semi-finals (now referred to as the \"Frozen Four\") for an unmatched 24th time.\n\nVic Heyliger led Michigan to a record six NCAA titles, including the first one in college hockey history in 1948. Heyliger, who played for the Wolverines from 1935 to 1937, also won national titles as Michigan coach in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. He was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974, in recognition of his lifetime achievement. Heyliger is considered instrumental in getting the NCAA Tournament off the ground. Following the 1946–47 season, Heyliger wrote to each of the college coaches around the country to see if they would be interested in creating a national tournament. They obliged and the inaugural four-team NCAA tournament began the following season in 1948. Heyliger was 228–61–13 as head coach at Michigan, and his .776 winning percentage is the best at the school. His only losing season was his first year, 3–6 in 1944–45.\n\nIn 1980, Heyliger was inducted into the University of Michigan Hall of Honor. The Vic Heyliger Trophy has been given out at the end of each season by the Michigan hockey team to recognize its most outstanding defenseman.\n\nThe Michigan men's lacrosse team is one of the oldest collegiate lacrosse programs in the midwest, having been founded in 1940, the program is also the most successful athletic program at Michigan, with an .830 all-time win percentage. The program was elevated from varsity-club status to NCAA status by the university in May 2011 and began NCAA Division I competition in 2012. The Wolverines previously competed at the Division I level of the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA), in the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association (CCLA). In 2008 the team became the first MCLA team to complete a season undefeated, finishing 20–0 and winning their first national championship at Texas Stadium. The feat was repeated in 2009 with another 20–0 season and earned their second national championship with a 12–11 victory over Chapman University at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Denver, Colorado. In 2010, they won their third MCLA national championship in a row, defeating Arizona State University 12–11 in Denver.\n\nIn 2008 Michigan faceoff specialist Brekan Kohlitz became the first MCLA player ever selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft when he was taken in the 5th round by the Washington Bayhawks.\n\nMichigan head coach John Paul is in his 13th year at his alma mater and has an overall record of 205–42 which includes 10 conference titles in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Michigan Lacrosse was the MCLA Division I National Champions in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\nWomen's rowing has been a varsity at sport at Michigan since 1996. Mark Rothstein has been the team's coach for 18 years – since it was a club sport in 1991. Rothstein led the rowing program \"from an over-achieving club squad to one of the nation's top-notch varsity rowing programs.\" The team has placed in the Top 10 at the NCAA tournament ten times in the past 12 years. The team's best seasons came in 2000–01 and 2011–12 with Big Ten championships and second-place finishes in the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe men's soccer team plays Michigan State annually for the rights to the Big Bear Trophy, a wooden sculpture purchased by Michigan head coach Steve Burns in 2000. Recently, the men's soccer team won the 2010 Big Ten Tournament Championship, their first in program history, and advanced to the College Cup, also their first in program history.\n\nThe women's soccer team has played at the varsity level since 1994 and has twice won the Big Ten conference tournament, in 1997 and 1999.

In June 2005, the team won the Division 1 NCAA Softball Championship, defeating two-time defending champion and perennial softball power UCLA two games to one. The decisive game was won with a Samantha Findlay walk-off home run in the 10th inning producing a 4–1 final. Michigan is the first school east of the Mississippi River to win the Women's College World Series since it was first done in 1976 (Carol Hutchins played shortstop on that team, Michigan State). The Wolverines have appeared in twelve Women's College World Series in 1982, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.\n\nMen's swimming and diving has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1921. With 19 NCAA national championships (7 were unofficial), including the 2013 NCAA championship, the Michigan men's swimming and diving team has won more national championships than any other varsity sport in the history of the university.

Brian Eisner was the coach from 1969 to 1999 and led the team to 16 Big Ten championships and 21 NCAA tournament appearances. Bruce Berque was the head coach from 2004 to 2014 and led the team to four consecutive appearances in the NCAA tournament. The current coach is Adam Steinberg.\n\nWomen's tennis was established as a varsity sport in 1973. Bitsy Ritt was the head coach for 22 years from 1984 to 2006 and led the team to eight NCAA tournament berths in eight of her last 11 years as head coach. The current head coach is Ronni Bernstein who has led the team to NCAA tournament berths in her first two years with the program.\n\nThe men's track and field team has won 57 Big Ten men's team titles and one NCAA team championship. Notable alumni include Ralph Craig, winner of two gold medals at the 1912 Olympics, Brian Diemer, 1984 Summer Olympics bronze medalist in the steeplechase, Bill Donakowski, U.S. marathon champion in 1986, Archie Hahn, a winner of four Olympic gold medals at the 1904 and 1906 Olympics, DeHart Hubbard, the first African-American to win an individual Olympic gold medal and a former world record holder in the long jump, Greg Meyer, 1983 Boston Marathon winner, Ralph Rose, winner of 3 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medals in three Olympic games, Kevin Sullivan, Canadian 1500 meter record holder, Eddie Tolan, winner of two gold medals and a former world record holder in the 100-yard dash, Alan Webb, U.S. mile record holder, and Nick Willis, a four-time Olympian and a two-time Olympic medallist, with a silver medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and a bronze at the summer Rio Olympics in 2016, Joseph Ellis, a multiple-time Big Ten champion and first-team All American in the hammer throw and member of the British national team, and Andrew Liskowitz, a Big Ten champion and first-team all American in the shot put throw.\n\nWomen's track and field was established as a varsity sport in 1978. The team has won 15 Big Ten titles (eight outdoor and seven indoor). James Henry has been the head coach since 1984. The Wolverines have had their strongest finishes in the NCAA tournament in recent years—finishing third in the 2007 outdoor tournament and third in the 2008 indoor tournament. Notable alumna include Lisa Larsen Weidenbach Rainsberger, who won the Boston and Chicago Marathons.\n\nThe women's volleyball program at the University of Michigan began in 1973. Mark Rosen has been the head coach since 1999 and has led the team to the NCAA Tournament in 12 of his 14 years as head coach.\n\nWomen's water polo became a varsity sport at the University of Michigan in 2001. In its first nine years, the program has placed first in the conference nine times, won eight NCAA division titles and four NCAA eastern titles, and appeared four times in the NCAA national tournament. The Wolverines finished in the Top 5 at the national tournament in 2002 and 2009.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, the Athletic Department hired Dr. Marcelo Leonardi as their new head coach. Dr. Marcelo Leonardi is in his first season as head coach for the Michigan women's water polo team. Leonardi took over the Michigan women's water polo program after spending the past five seasons as the women's water polo coach at California State University in Northridge. He also serves as the national technical director for the women's Olympic Development Program (ODP) associated with the organization since 2013. Caitlin Haskell, the assistant coach, played varsity water polo at University of California, Irvine. The Wolverines enter their 15th season in 2015. Former Olympic Gold Medalist Betsey Armstrong was hired as the assistant coach in 2012.\n\nWrestling has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1921. The Wolverines have finished in the Top 5 in the NCAA tournament 16 times. Home dual meets and tournaments take place at Cliff Keen Arena, dedicated and named after longtime wrestling coach Cliff Keen, who coached the team from 1925 until 1970 and led the Wolverines wrestling team to 13 Big Ten Conference championships. The Michigan wrestling team has produced 175 individual NCAA All-Americans dating back to 1928, has 22 individual NCAA Championships for the university, and made two winners of the NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler Award (1940, 1978).\n\nA few notable former Wolverine wrestlers include Olympic gold medalist Steve Fraser, 1978 NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler Mark Churella, professional wrestlers The Steiner Brothers and 2006 Greco-Roman World Wrestling Champion Joe Warren, currently a mixed martial artist in Bellator MMA.\n\nMichigan Athletics announced in July 2015 that it would switch from sponsorship by Adidas to Nike. The deal at the time had an estimated value of $169 million and was described as \"the richest apparel deal in intercollegiate athletics\". In April 2016, the University announced the signing of an 11-year $127.12 million contract for 31 Michigan sports teams, going into effect on August 1. With the agreement, Michigan Wolverines football became the first football program to wear Jordan Brand attire accompanied by the jumpman logo. Nike identifies the yellow color in the new uniforms as \"Amarillo\" rather than the traditional \"Maize\".\n\nIn 2000, athletic director Bill Martin announced the creation of a special level for sports at Michigan called Varsity Club status. The new system was established to recognize and increase support for club sports teams that have reached a level of budget, organization and competition that is similar to varsity levels. Varsity club squads are not necessarily closer to being elevated to full varsity status, and will remain for the time being primarily self-funded and administered through the Department of Recreational Sports. However, the designation will give these teams a closer relationship to the U-M athletic department. The Varsity Club status has proven to be a launching pad for sports to eventually become varsity sports at Michigan. In May 2011, Men's and Women's Lacrosse were officially granted varsity status. Men's Lacrosse began their first season of NCAA competition in 2012 while the Women's program will begin varsity competition in 2014.\n\nCurrent varsity club sports:\n\nThe Club Sports Program at the University of Michigan, administered by the Department of Recreational Sports, comprises 35 club sports. Each club sport is a student-led organization composed primarily of students, faculty, and staff. Each club is formed, developed, governed, and administered by the student membership of that particular club, working with the Club Sports Program staff.\n\nThe club sports programs include:\n\n\nThe men's and women's boxing teams compete as part of the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association. The men's team won the USIBA national championship in 2014 and 2017, while the women's team won four straight championships from 2015 to 2018. Michigan also hosted the 2015 USIBA tournament.\n\nThe University of Michigan Rugby Football Club plays college rugby in the Big Ten Universities conference of Division 1-A against its traditional rivals such as Michigan State and Ohio State. The Michigan rugby club was formed in 1959, although rugby at Michigan dates back to at least 1890 before fading from campus. Michigan rugby is led by head coach Brandon Sparks. Michigan reached the 2013 Big Ten championship match, where they lost to Indiana 58–38. Michigan played in the 2014 Collegiate Rugby Championship, notching some upset wins to reach the quarterfinals in a tournament broadcast live on NBC from PPL Park in Philadelphia. Michigan returned to the 2015 Collegiate Rugby Championship, where they notched wins against UCLA and Texas to again reach the quarterfinals.\n\nMichigan has won 36 NCAA team titles.\n\n\n\nUM's official NCAA Division I national championships have come from 10 different sports – this broad-based success matches the University of Texas for fourth place in the NCAA record book. Only UCLA and Stanford, each with titles in 16 varying sports, and USC in 15, have more diverse championship histories than the Wolverines.\n\nUniversity of Michigan teams have also been national runners-up 38 times in 13 different sports: men's basketball (6), women's cross country (1), women's field hockey (1), men's golf (3), men's gymnastics (2), women's gymnastics (2), men's ice hockey (3), women's rowing (2), softball (1), men's swimming and diving (10), women's swimming and diving (1), men's outdoor track and field (1), and wrestling (5).\n\n\nIn the NCAA Division I Director's Cup (renamed Learfield Sports Directors' Cup), Michigan has ranked No. 1 in the Big Ten rankings in 14 out of the last 26 years ending in 2018–19; the university has ranked in the top 5 nationally a total of 13 years during that 26-year span.\n\nThrough the 2008 Summer Olympics, 204 UM students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals at each Summer Olympic Games except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. Through the year 2016, UM students have won a total of 151 Olympic medals: 72 Golds, 39 Silvers, and 40 Bronzes.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines is one of the few college sports teams that does not have a mascot, largely for reasons of tradition. In the late 1920s, the Wolverines did have an unofficial mascot – Biff, the Michigan Wolverine. The first Biff was a stuffed wolverine. The second Biff was a live wolverine, who had a companion named Bennie, but the two mustelids grew to become too ferocious to be taken to games, which ended their career as mascots.\n\n"}

They are essentially tropical New World birds, although the range of two species just reaches the United States. Recent DNA evidence places them in the group Crotophaginae.\n\nUnlike some cuckoos, the anis are not brood parasites, but nest communally, the cup nest being built by several pairs from 2–6 m high in a tree. A number of females lay their eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding.\n\nThe anis are large black birds with a long tail and a deep ridged black bill. Their flight is weak and wobbly, but they run well, and usually feed on the ground.\n\nThese are very gregarious species, always found in noisy groups. Anis feed on termites, large insects and even lizards and frogs. The claim that they will remove ticks and other parasites from grazing animals has been disputed; while there is no doubt that anis follow grazing animals in order to catch disturbed insects and will occasionally eat fallen ticks, there is no proof that they remove ticks from the animals' bodies.\n\nFossils of two ani species have been found from Pleistocene rocks, dated to between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago.\n\nIn Merriam-Webster dictionary online the word ani is from New Latin possibly partly incorrect rendering of the native name of the bird in Brazilian Tupi language.

{"id": "2017420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017420", "title": "Feminization of poverty", "text": "Feminization of poverty\n\nFeminization of poverty refers to a trend of increasing inequality in living standards between men and women widening gap in poverty between women and men as noticed towards the end of the twentieth century. This phenomenon is not only a consequence of lack of income, but is also the result of the deprivation of capabilities and gender biases present in both societies and governments. It covers the poverty of choices and opportunities such as the ability to lead a long, healthy, and creative life, and enjoying basic rights like freedom, respect, and dignity.\n\nThe term in itself is controversial and has been defined in many different ways focusing on income, assets, time, health deprivations, and social and cultural exclusions.\n\nThe concept of the ‘feminization of poverty’ dates back to the 1970s and became popular in the 1990s through some United Nations documents. It became a prominent in popular society after a study focusing on gender patterns in the evolution of poverty rates in the United States was released.\n\nThe feminization of poverty is a relative concept based on a women-men comparison. For instance, if poverty in a society is distinctly reduced among men and is only slightly reduced among women, there would be a feminization of poverty.\n\nThere are many definitions on the feminization of poverty. One definition talks of a widening gap in the quality of life between women and men while another describes a gap between female-headed households and in male or couple-headed households.\n\nIt likewise depicts the escalating role that gender discrimination has in determining poverty. For instance, an increase of wage discrimination between males and females also exacerbates poverty among women and men of all types of families. This can be understood as a feminization of poverty because it denotes the relation between the biases against women and a rise in poverty. In numerous cases, such changes in the causes of poverty will result in one of the types of the feminization of poverty, that is, the relative changes in the poverty levels of women and female-headed households.\n\nThe concept also served to illustrate the many social and economic factors contributing to women's poverty, including the significant gender pay gap between women and men.\n\nThe term originates in the US and the question posed is whether or not it is an international phenomenon. The proportion of female-headed households whose incomes fall below the \"poverty line\" has been broadly adopted as a measure of women's poverty. In many countries, household consumption and expenditure surveys show a high incidence of female-headed households among the \"poor,\" defined as those whose incomes fall below the poverty line.\n\nThere are two assumptions underlying income-based measures of poverty. First, there is that tendency to equate income with the ability to control income. While women may control earned income, the limits on poor women's financial sovereignty have been well demonstrated. An income-based measure may hide the extent and nature of poverty when women earn an income but have no control over those earnings. While the question of who controls income is a delicate matter for women, it is also relevant to the position and well-being of men. Societies that place upon individuals a heavy communal, kinship or clan-based obligation may end in both women and men having limited control over individual income.\n\nSecond, is the assumption that income creates equal access and generates equal benefits. Access to education illustrates the point. While lack of financial resources may result in low enrollment or high drop-out rates among poor children, social values around the role of women and the importance of formal education for girls are likely to be more meaningful in demonstrating the difference between male and female enrollment rates.\n\nThere are several factors that place women at high risk of poverty. These include the gender wage gaps, women's prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing public benefits. Feminisation of poverty is a problem which may be most severe in parts of South Asia, and may also differ by social class. Although low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. The image of a \"traditional\" woman and a traditional role still influences many cultures in today's world and is still not in full realization that women are essential part of the economy. In addition, income poverty lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens the cycle of poverty. Beyond income, poverty manifests in other dimensions such as time poverty and capability deprivations. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.\n\nSingle mother households are critical in addressing feminization of poverty and can be broadly defined as households in which there are female headships and no male headships. Single mother households are at the highest risk of poverty for women due to lack of Income and resources. There is a continuing increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty. Single mothers are the poorest women in society, and their children tend to be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers. Different factors can be taken into account for the rise in the number of female headship in households. When men become migrant workers, women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Those women who have the opportunity to work usually don't get better jobs with a furthered education. They are left with jobs that don't offer financial sustainability or benefits. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in developing countries.\n\nFemale headed households are most susceptible to poverty because they have fewer income earners to provide financial support within the household. According to a case study in Zimbabwe, households headed by widows have an income of approximately half that of male-headed households, and de facto female headed households have about three quarters of the income of male headed households. Additionally, single mother households lack critical resources in life, which worsens their state of poverty. They do not have access to the opportunities to attain a decent standard of living along with basic needs such as health and education. Single mother households relate to gender inequality issues as women are more susceptible to poverty and lack essential life needs in comparison to men.\n\nParenting in poverty ridden conditions can cause emotional instability for a child and their relationship with a single mother.\n\nMany factors contribute to becoming impoverished. Some of these factors are more prevalent in the lives of single mothers. When demographic attributes of single mothers are surveyed, a few factors showed up in higher rates. Marital status (divorced or widowed), education, and race correlated strongly with levels of poverty for single mothers. Specifically, very few mothers on the poverty line had a college degree and were having to \"work to make ends meet\". Not only do these demographic attributes affect parenting in poverty, emotional attributes provided an instability as well when viewed by Dr. Bloom. Mothers have been noted as the \"caregivers\" or \"nurturer\" of families. Some stereotypical things that are expected of mothers are harder to provide in a low-income household when a mother is the main provider. Dr. Bloom's example of a stereotypical mother job was bringing treats to school on birthdays and expected to go to parent teacher conferences. A researcher, Denise Zabkiewicz, surveyed single mothers in poverty and measured rates of depression over time. Since recent studies in 2010 had brought the idea that work was beneficial for mental health, Zabkiewicz thought to research if jobs were mentally beneficial to poverty line single mothers. Those results concluded to be true; mothers’ rates of depression were significantly lower when one held a stable, long-term job. The likelihood of getting a full-time job decreases with certain factors. When these certain factors were surveyed in single moms they occurred at higher rates: co-inhabiting, college degree, and use of welfare. All of these factors are ones that the researchers, Brian Brown and Daniel Lichter, identified as contributing to single mothers' poverty.\n\nEmployment opportunities are limited for women worldwide. The ability to materially control one's environment by gaining equal access to work that is humanizing and allows for meaningful relationships with other workers is an essential capability. Employment is not only about financial independence, but about higher security through an established legal position, real world experience, deeply important for sheltered or shy women, and higher regard within the family, which gives women a better bargaining position. Though there has been major growth in women's employment, the quality of the jobs still remains deeply unequal. Teenage motherhood is a factor that corresponds to poverty.\n\nThere are two kinds of employment: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women. The burden of informal care work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with caring responsibilities, which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment. Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this \"child-effect\" has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This has less to do with child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike.\n\nA form of sexual violence on the rise in the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more people on the streets. Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel's dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts have a difficult time escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There are more people current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. \"Branding\" of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets.\n\nA major key to reducing women's poverty is to emphasize the importance of higher education. Basic education, gives the ability to make informed choices and have opportunities to achieve goals. This enables not only women to reduce household poverty, but as well increases children's chances of education, and enhances maternal health and freedom of movement. Although the world is making progress toward gender equality in education, approximately one quarter of girls in the developing world do not attend school. The strong gender discrimination and social hierarchies in these developing countries limit women's access to basic education. \n\nGender implications and the social costs of poverty include the difference between the way boys and girls get treated in households, girls not getting the education desired, dropout rates from school for girls, the need in pushing girls to be married off quickly, girls having no right or control over fertility and girls choosing prostitution as an escape this portrays the inequality and the difference between the situations girls and boys suffer.\n\nFamilies that are poor and are living in rural areas of Africa will send their sons to school instead of their daughters for many different reasons. School fees will keep parents from sending their daughters to school because they are not deemed worthy of an education. Girls are also kept home to learn how to care for a family by doing chores, taking care of younger siblings, cooking and cleaning. Girls who are enrolled in school have a higher chance of dropping out compared to boys due to the chance of rape or sexual assault that could lead to an unwanted pregnancy. There are extremely high levels of claims of professional misconduct, usually in the terms of sexual favors by females for grades. Because of sexual harassment by students and lecturers, there is a large inequality of higher education for females.\n\nWomen are more likely to be poor, and to be responsible for the care of poor children, than men. Approximately 70 percent of the world's poor are women; rural women developing countries are among the most disadvantaged groups on the planet. They are therefore unlikely to have the necessary resources to cope with the changes brought by climate change, and very likely to suffer a worsening of their everyday conditions. Poor women are more likely to be hurt or killed by natural disasters and extreme weather events than men. There is also evidence to suggest that when households experience food shortages, women tend to go without so that their children may eat, with all the health implications this brings for them. Since poverty and climate change are closely linked, the poorest and most disadvantaged groups often depend on climate-sensitive livelihoods like agriculture, which makes them disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. These groups lack the resources required to weather severe climatic effects like better houses and drought-resistant crops. This diminished adaptive capacity makes them even more vulnerable, pushing them to take part in unsustainable environmental practices such as deforestation in order to maintain their well-being. The extent to which people are impacted by climate change is partially a function of their social status, power, poverty, and access to and control over resources. Women are more vulnerable to the influences of climate change since they make up the bulk of the world's poor and are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. Limited mobility combined with unequal access to resources and to decision-making processes places women in rural areas in a position where they are disproportionately affected by climate change. There are three main arguments in association to women and climate change. Firstly, that women need special attention because they are the poorest of the poor; secondly, because they have a higher mortality rate during natural disasters caused by climate change and thirdly because women are more environmentally conscious. While the first two refer mainly to the women in the South, the last is especially apparent in the literature on gender and climate change in the North. The feminization of poverty has been used to illustrate differences between male and female poverty in a given context as well as changes in male and female poverty over time. Typically, this approach has fed the perception that female-headed households, however, defined, tend to be poorer than other households. Women are clearly more disadvantaged than men by poor household infrastructure or the lack of piped water and less-consuming energy sources.\n\nIn addition to earning less, women may encounter \"Femonomics\", or gender of money, a term created by Reeta Wolfsohn, CMSW, to reflect many of the inequities women face that increase their likelihood of suffering from financial difficulties. The image of a \"traditional\" woman and a traditional role still influences many cultures in today's world and is still not in full realisation that women are essential part of the economy. Women have unique healthcare problems/access problems related to reproduction increasing both their healthcare costs and risks. Research also shows that females tend to live five years longer on average than men. The death of a spouse is an important determinant of female old-age poverty, as it leaves women in charge of the finances. However, women are more likely to be financially illiterate and thus have a harder time knowing how to manage their money.\n\nIn 2009 Gornick \"et al.\" found that older women (over 60) were typically much wealthier than their national average in Germany, US, UK, Sweden and Italy (data from 1999–2001). In the US their wealth holdings were four times the national median.\n\nWomen in poverty have reduced access to health care services and resources. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health, be adequately nourished, and have proper shelter can make an enormous difference to their lives. Gender inequality in society prevents women from utilizing care services and therefore puts women at risk of poor health, nutrition, and severe diseases. Women in poverty are also more vulnerable to sexual violence and risk of HIV/AIDS, as they are less able to defend themselves from influential people who might sexually abuse them. HIV transmission adds to the stigma and social risk for women and girls. Other ailments such as malnutrition and parasite burden can weaken the mother and create a dangerous environment, making sex, birth, and maternal care riskier for poor women. In Korea poor health is a key factor in household poverty.\n\nDue to financial aid programs for impoverished families assuming only women to be responsible for the maintenance of a household and caring for children, the burden may fall on women to ensure this financial aid is properly managed. Such programs also tend to assume that women all have the same social standing and needs, even though this is not the case. This effect is exacerbated by the increased number of NGOs targeting solely female development. Women are expected to maintain the household as well as lift the family out of poverty, responsibilities which can add to the burden of poverty that females face in developing nations. In many areas, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs provide direct financial assistance to women with the goal of lifting them out of poverty, but they often end up limiting women's income-earning potential. The programs typically expect women to be responsible for the health and educational outcomes of their children, as well as require them to complete other program activities that don't allow them the time to pursue vocational or educational opportunities that would result in higher income-earning potential.\n\nDecision-making power is central to the bargaining position of women within the household. It is how women and men make decisions that affect the entire household unit. However, women and men often have very different priorities when it comes to determining what is most important for the family. Factors that determine which member of the household has the most power in decision-making vary across cultures, but in most countries there is extreme gender inequality. Men of the household usually have the power to determine what choices are made towards women's health, their ability to visit friends and family, and household expenditures. The ability to make choices for their own health affects both women and children's health. How household expenditures are decided affects women and children's education, health, and well-being. Women's freedom of mobility affects their ability to provide for their own needs as well as for the needs of their children.\n\nGender discrimination within households is often rooted in patriarchal biases against the social status of women. Major determinants of the household bargaining power include control of income and assets, age, and access to and level of education. As women's decision-making power increases, the welfare of their children and the family in general benefits. Women who achieve greater education are also more likely to worry about their children's survival, nutrition, and school attendance.\n\nLack of income is a principal reason for women's risk of poverty. Income deprivation prevents women from attaining resources and converting their monetary resources into socioeconomic status. Not only does higher income allow greater access to job skills; obtaining more job skills raises income as well. As women earn less income than men, and struggle to access public benefits. They are deprived of basic education and health care, which eventually becomes a cycle to debilitate women's ability to earn higher income.\n\nAccording to Martha Nussbaum, one central human functional capability is being able to hold property of both land and movable goods. In various nations, women are not full equals under the law, which means they do not have the same property rights as men; the rights to make a contract; or the rights of association, mobility, and religious liberty. Assets are primarily owned by husbands or are used for household production or consumption, neither of which help women with loan repayments. In order to refund their loans, women are usually required to undergo the ‘disempowering’ process of having to work harder as wage laborers, while also encountering a growing gendered resource divide at the domestic level. One of the major factors influencing women to greater poverty are the limited opportunities, capabilities, and empowerment in terms of access to and control over production resources of land, labor, human capital assets including education and health, and social capital assets such as participation at various levels, legal rights, and protection.\n\nTime is a component that is included in poverty because it is an essential resource that is oftentimes distributed inequitably across individuals, especially in the context of the inadequacy of other resources. It is extremely relevant to gender, with a marked difference in gender roles and responsibilities observed across the world. Women are certainly more time-poor than men across the income distribution. Women concentrate on reproductive or unremunerated activities, while men concentrate in productive or compensated activities. Women generally face more limited access to leisure and work more hours in the sum of productive and reproductive work than do men. Time poverty can be interpreted in regards to the lack of sufficient time to rest and sleep. The greater the time devoted to paid or unremunerated work, the less time there is available for other activities such as relaxation and pleasure. A person who lacks adequate time to sleep and rest, levies and works in a state of ‘time poverty’. The allocation of time between women and men in the household and in the economy, is a major gender issue in the evolving discourse on time poverty. According to the capabilities approach, any inquiry into people's well-being must involve asking not only how much people make but also how they manage their time in order to obtain the goods and services to meet their livelihoods. Time poverty is a serious constraint on individual well-being as it prevents having sufficient rest and sleep, enjoying leisure, and taking part in community or social life.\n\nSince the last twenty-five years, feminist research has consistently stressed the importance of more holistic conceptual frameworks to encapsulate gendered privation. These include: ‘capability’ and ‘human development’ frameworks, which identify factors such as deprivations in education and health. Another is 'livelihoods' frameworks, which indicate social as well as material assets. Also, 'social exclusion' perspectives, which highlight the marginalization of the poor; and frameworks which stress the significance of subjective dimensions of poverty such as self-esteem, dignity, choice, and power. A higher share of women than of men are poor, women undergo greater depth or severity of poverty than men, women are likely to experience more persistent and longer-term poverty than men, women's irregular burden of poverty is increasing relative to men, women face more difficulties in lifting themselves out of poverty, and women-headed households are the ‘poorest of the poor’ are the common characterizations of the ‘Feminization of poverty’.\n\nPoor women are more vulnerable to chronic diseases because of material deprivation and psychosocial stress, higher levels of risk behavior, unhealthy living conditions and limited access to good quality healthcare. Women are more susceptible to diseases in poverty because they are less well-nourished and healthy than men and more vulnerable to physical violence and sexual abuse. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health, be adequately nourished, and have adequate shelter can make an enormous difference to their lives. Violence against women is a major contributing factor to HIV infection. Stillwaggon argues that in sub-Saharan Africa poverty associated with high-risk for HIV transmission adds to the stigma and social risk for women and girls in particular. Poverty and its correlates like malnutrition and parasite burden can weaken the host and create a dangerous environment, making sex and birth and medical care riskier for poor women.\n\nOther metrics can be used besides the poverty line, to see whether or not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.\n\nAn important aspect of analyzing the feminization of poverty is the understanding of how it is measured. It is inaccurate to assume that income is the only deprivation that affects women's poverty. To examine the issue from a multidimensional perspective, there must first be accurate and indices available for policy makers interested in gender empowerment. Often aggregate indices are criticized for their concentration on monetary issues, especially when data on women's income is sparse and groups women into one large, undifferentiated mass. Three indexes often examined are Gender-related Development Index, Gender Empowerment Measure, and Human Poverty Index. The first two are gendered- indices, in that they specifically gather data on women to evaluate gender inequalities, and are useful in understanding disparities in gender opportunities and choices. HPI, however, focuses on deprivation measures rather than income measures.\nGDI adjusts the Human Development Index in three ways:\nThe aim of this index is to rank countries according to both their absolute level of human development and relative scores on gender equality. Although this index has increased government attention to gender inequality and development, its three measures have often been criticized for neglecting important aspects. Its relevance, however, continues to be integral to the understanding of the feminization of poverty, as countries with lower scores may then be then stimulated to focus on policies to assess and reduce gender disparities.\nGEM measures female political and income opportunities through:\nHPI is a multidimensional, non-income-based approach. It takes into consideration four dimensions:\nThis index is useful in understanding and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and income poverty. For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty. In her article, \"Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure\", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands on the possibility of a gender-sensitive index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health services, access to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, it is important to note that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women.\n\nWithin many of the major religious groups in the world, focus is placed upon traditional gender roles and each individual's duty. Many devout followers of each religion have used their respective religious texts or rulings to further the poverty cycle of women around the world.\n\nIn a 2004 report by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, Muslim women were found more likely to work part-time jobs than Muslim men because of their religion's emphasis on the role of women as caregivers and housekeepers. The study found that these women are more likely to be financially dependent than men because of they choose to participate less in the labor market. Muslim women who choose to wear traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs may have a more difficult time finding employment than those who do not wear such clothing. On the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for refusing to remove her hijab at work because it violated the company's \"no hat\" rule. In the 2008 case Webb versus Philadelphia, the court ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality. Because of the violation of this standard, she was not allowed to legally wear the hijab while on duty.\n\nUnder traditional Halachic law, Jewish women are also considered to be household caregivers rather than breadwinners. Within the Jewish text, the Mishnah, it states \"she should fill for him his cup, make ready his bed and wash his face, hands and feet,\" when describing the role of women under Jewish law.\n\nCertain sects of Christianity also regard women as more family-oriented than men. Women in certain sects of Christianity, namely Pentecostal women, may leave their faith traditions in order to obtain employment and escape poverty.\n\nMany developing countries in the world have exceptionally high rates of females under the poverty line. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe deprive women of access to higher income and important capabilities. Women in these countries are disproportionately put at the highest risk of poverty and continue to face social and cultural barriers that prevent them from escaping poverty.\n\nAlthough China has grown tremendously in its economy over the past years, its economic growth has had minimal effect on decreasing the number of females below the poverty line. Economic growth did not reduce gender gaps in income or provide more formal employment opportunities for women. Instead, China's economic growth increased its use of informal employment, which has affected women disproportionately. In the Republic of Korea, low wages for women helped instigate an economic growth in Korea since low-cost exports were mostly produced by women. Similar to China, Korean women mostly had the opportunity for informal employment, which deprives women of financial stability and safe working environments. Although women in East Asia had greater access to employment, they faced job segregation in export industries, which placed them at a high risk of poverty.\n\nChina is a country with a long history of gender discrimination. In order to address gender inequality issues, Chinese leaders have created more access for women to obtain capabilities. As a result, Chinese women are granted greater access to health services, employment opportunities, and general recognition for their important contributions to the economy and society.\n\nWomen in Africa face considerable barriers to achieving economic equality with their male counterparts due to a general lack of property rights, access to credit, education and technical skills, health, protection against gender-based violence, and political power. Although women work 50% longer workdays than men, they receive two-thirds of the pay of their male counterparts and hold only 40% of formal salaried jobs. The longer workdays can be attributed to the cultural expectations of women to perform forms of unpaid labor such as gathering firewood, drawing water, childcare, eldercare, and housework. Women face greater challenges in finding employment because of their lack of education. According to Montenegro and Patrinos, one additional year of primary, secondary, and tertiary school can increase future wages by 17.5%, 12.7%, and 21.3% respectively. Unfortunately, due to factors such as child marriage, early pregnancy, and cultural norms, only 21% of girls complete tertiary school. Without formal property rights, women in Africa only own 15% of the land, which makes them more vulnerable to be economically dependent on male family members or partners and diminishes their ability to use property to access financial systems such as banks and loans. As a result of having less economic power, women are generally more vulnerable to gender-based violence and risk of HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe female population, especially in rural areas, dominantly represents the face of poverty in Morocco. There have been two major methods to measure poverty in Morocco, which include the 'classic approach' and a second approach that pertains more towards the capabilities approach. The 'classic approach' uses the poverty line to statistically determine the impoverished population. This approach quantifies the number of poor individuals and households but does not take into account how the impoverished population lacks basic needs such as housing, food, health and education. The second approach focuses on satisfying this lack of basic needs and emphasizes the multidimensional nature of poverty.\n\nMoroccan women represent the most economically insecure social group in the country. One of six Moroccan households are lone-mother households, which represent the most impoverished households in the country. Women are categorized to have the highest levels of socio-economic and legal constraints, which exclude them from obtaining their basic needs. Although recent surveys show that women actively help in providing for their families economically, Moroccan legal texts discourage women's participation in economic productivity. Article 114 of the Moroccan Family Law states, \"every human being is responsible for providing for his needs by his own powers except the wife whose needs will be taken care of by her husband.\" The patriarchal social structure of Morocco puts women as being inferior to men in all aspects. Women are denied equal opportunities in education and employment before the law, as well as access to resources. As a result, the female population in Morocco suffers from deprivation of capabilities. Young girls are often excluded from educational opportunities due to limited financial resources within the household and the burden of household chores expected from them.\n\nOver time, Moroccan women have gained more access to employment. However, this quantitative increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into a higher risk of poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, women are more likely to lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.\n\nAn investigation of females below the poverty line in the United Kingdom between 1959 and 1984 discovered a substantial increase in the percentage of females who are in poverty in the 1960s. The percentage remained relatively constant in the 1970s, and then decreased between 1979 and 1984. The increase of females below the poverty line in the 1960s was determined to be from an increase of women in one-sex households. This was more adverse for blacks than whites.\n\nDominican women make generally forty-four cents on the dollar as compared to men. This wage gap often leads to a high level of food insecurity among women in the Dominican Republic. Those in poverty have an increased likelihood to participate in dangerous behaviors such as unprotected sex and drug use. These behaviors put them at a greater risk for contracting HIV and other diseases. There is a negative stigma around HIV positive women in the Dominican Republic. For this reason, women are more likely to be subjected to health screenings when applying for a job. If the screening reveals a person is HIV positive, they are less likely to be given employment.\n\nIn 2016, 14.0% of women and 11.3% of men were below the poverty threshold. The 2016 poverty threshold was $12,228 for single people and $24,339 for a family of four with two children.\n\nIn response, the United States government provides financial assistance to those who do not earn as much money. In 2015, 23.2% of women were given financial assistance compared with 19.3% of men. More women are given financial assistance than men in all government programs (Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance, SSI, TANF/GA). Women were given 86% of child-support in 2013.\n\nThe poverty that women experience in India is known as human poverty, or issues of inadequate food, housing, education, healthcare, sanitation, poor developmental policies, and more. Poverty has been prevalent in India for many years, but there was a noticeable increase after globalization in 1991 when the International Monetary Fund instilled a structural adjustment program (SAP) in order to give India a loan. Large amounts of capital flowed into the country but also led to the exploitation of the Indian market, particularly of women for their cheap labor. This reduced their opportunities for education and escape from the poverty trap.\n\nThe Indian Constitution has proclaimed that all citizens have equal rights, but this is not always practiced by all Indians. Sex-selective abortion is a wide phenomenon in India in which males are preferentially selected. In order to get married, it is normal to see the girl's family paying dowry to the male's family. This leads to more sex-selective abortion as females are more costly for the family, and less focus on female development.\n\nWomen are restricted in India due to a heavy dependency of social status on female appearance and activity around the home. Poor behavior on their part results in lower social status and shame for the male head of the family. Women are expected to maintain the household with a strict schedule. Husbands often move to the city to find work and leave their wife as the primary earner in their absence. Women in these situations may resort to using favors or borrowing money in order to survive, which they must later return in cash with interest. Young girls are especially vulnerable to prostitution or bribing as a form of repayment. Competition amongst women around water, food, and employment is also prevalent, especially in urban slums.\n\nThe expectation for Indian women is to be the sole care taker and maintainer of the home. If women leave their children and work they are often left in the hands of a poor care taker (possibly the eldest daughter) and don't get enough resources for development. In many areas working outside of the home is seen as symbolic of having low status. Upper-class women have similar social restrictions, although lower class females frequently have a larger necessity of the added income than upper class females. Men tend to send money back to extended family, whereas money that a woman makes goes to her husband. This reduces the incentive of the family to urge their daughter to find work as they wouldn't receive money but would face shame in society.\n\nConceptual barriers prevent women from being accepted as equally paid and equally able laborers. In many ways women are seen as excess reserve labor and get pushed into roles that are known as being dirty, unorganized, arduous, and underdeveloped. They are hurt by the mechanization of industries and while self-employment is a viable option, there is always a large risk of failure and exploitation.\n\nHealthcare is difficult to access for women, particularly elderly women. Public clinics are overcrowded, understaffed, and have high transportation costs, while private clinics are too expensive without insurance. Females are more likely to get ill than males although males receive medical advice with higher frequency. Women frequently feel as if they are a burden to their husband or son when they get sick and require money to purchase the correct medicines. Some believe that their symptoms are not serious or important enough to spend money on. When women do receive some form of care, many times medical providers are biased against them and are partial to treating males over females. Many mothers also die during childbirth or pregnancy as they suffer from malnutrition and anemia. Over 50% of women in the National Family Health Surveys were anemic.\n\nPoverty is a large source of malnutrition in women. Women in poverty are not allowed to eat the nutritious food that men are when it is available. While it is the women's job to obtain the food, it is fed to the males of the household. The 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey found that more men drink milk and eat fruit in comparison to women, and that less than 5% of females in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan eat meat or eggs. Poor nutrition begins at a young age and gets worse as women mature and become mothers.\n\nEffective policies to aid in expanding female education aren't productively enforced by the Government of India. Data from the 2001 census showed that primary school completion rates were around 62% for males and 40% for females. Teenage girls are generally taught how to care for their siblings and cook food and not taught math or science. Some families may believe men to be more qualified than women to get a higher paying job. In many instances this inequality between male and female education leads to child marriage, teenage pregnancies, and a male dominated household. Evidence suggests that educating girls results in reduced fertility, due to an urge to work and pursue higher social status. This lessens the financial burden on families.\n\nConditional cash transfer is a possible policy for addressing current and intergenerational poverty where poor women play a central role. Women in the role as mothers are given the additional work burdens imposed. Conditional cash transfers are not ideal for addressing single-mother poverty.\n\nMicrocredit can be a potential policy for assisting poor women in developing countries. Microcredit is a tool design to hopefully alleviate poverty given that women living in developing countries have very few resources and connections for survival due to not having a solid financial foundation.\n\nIn light of welfare reforms as of 2001, federal legislation required recipients of welfare (mainly aided to families) to participate in an educational or vocational school and work part-time in order to receive the benefits. Recipients attending a college now have 3 years to complete those degree in order to get people to work as quickly as possible. To try towards a system of reward, Mojisola Tiamiyu and Shelley Mitchell, suggest implementing child care services to promote employment. Women with children work in either low-paying or part-time jobs that are insufficient to raise a family. Single parenting in the United States has increased to 1 in 4 families being headed by a single parent. It is estimated that children living in single parent homes are as much as 4 times more likely to become impoverished (Juvenilization of poverty).\n\nC APTURING WOMEN'S MULTIDIMENSIONAL EXPERIENCES OF EXTREME POVERTY\n\nWhy many of the hungry are women\n\nGentrification Is a Feminist Issue: The Intersection of Class, Race, Gender and Housing\n"}

{"id": "2017445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017445", "title": "Shout (Devo album)", "text": "Shout (Devo album)\n\nShout is the sixth studio album by American new wave band Devo. It was originally released in October 1984, on the labels Warner Bros. and Virgin, two years after their previous album, \"Oh, No! It's Devo\". The album was recorded over a period of ten months between July 1983 and Feb 1984, in sessions that took place at the Record Plant in Los Angeles, California. The album retained the synth-pop sound of their previous few records, with an extensive focus on the then-new Fairlight CMI \"Series IIx\" digital sampling synthesizer. Despite the popularity of synth-pop in 1984, the album was a critical and commercial failure, peaking at only No. 83 on the \"Billboard 200\" and ultimately leading to Warner Bros. dropping the band from their label. \"Shout\" was the second Devo album (after 1981's \"New Traditionalists\") in which co-founder and bass player Gerald Casale sang the majority of the lead vocals, which are usually performed by Mark Mothersbaugh.\n\nFollowing its release, the band went on hiatus for four years. Although the band would release two studio albums through Enigma Records, they would not release another album through Warner Bros. until \"Something for Everybody\" in 2010. The band themselves have been quite vocal in that they were not satisfied with the completed album, and in response to a question from a fan on Twitter, Casale once said that recording the album was even \"too painful to talk about.\"\n\nAs with every Devo album, the band developed a new look for the album, eschewing the black T-shirts and slacks with white \"Spud Ring\" collars of the \"Oh, No! It's Devo\" period and replacing them with \"Chinese-American Friendship Suits.\"\n\n\"Shout\" was the first of two Devo albums to use the Fairlight CMI, the other being 1988's \"Total Devo\". These approaches further pushed the sound of the guitar into the background of their music. \"Shout\" was the final album by the 1976–1985 line-up of Devo, with their third and most prominent drummer, Alan Myers, leaving the band shortly after the album's release. According to the book \"We Are Devo\", Myers cited a lack of creative fulfillment as his reason for leaving the band, something that he had felt since Devo's move to Los Angeles in the late 1970s. Devo's increased use of drum machines and electronics through the years had greatly reduced Myers' role in the band, although Gerald Casale has said that he begged Myers not to leave.\n\nOne of \"Shout\"'s singles is \"Are You Experienced?\", a Jimi Hendrix cover that carried on the Devo tradition of radically transforming notable songs which began with their 1977 cover of the Rolling Stones song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" The chorus melody of another Hendrix song, \"Third Stone from the Sun,\" is transformed into a backwards guitar solo partway through the track. Similarly, \"The 4th Dimension\" incorporates the guitar hook from the Beatles' song \"Day Tripper\", \"Jurisdiction of Love\" contains a few notes from \"Love Machine\" by the Miracles and \"Here to Go\" quotes a bit of the music to Wilson Pickett hit \"Land of a Thousand Dances.\"\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Billboard\" magazine, Gerald Casale stated that \"Shout\" was the biggest regret of his career, \"because the Fairlight [synthesizer] just kind of took over everything on that record. I mean, I loved the songwriting and the ideas, but the Fairlight kind of really determined the sound.\" According to a 2005 interview with the band's guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh, \"Mark and Jerry kept saying in interviews that the guitar was obsolete and wanted to prove it with the \"Shout\" album.\"\n\nThe album cover photograph, taken by Karen Filter, is a head shot of Timothy Leary's son Zachary Chase on a composite background with his left hand raised by his open mouth in a \"shout\" gesture. The album's back cover depicts a head shot photo of guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh's daughter Alex with her eyes focused upwards and her left hand raised by her ear in a listening gesture. It's notably their first album since 1978's \"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!\" not to feature any of the band's members on the outside cover.\n\nA lavish music video for \"Are You Experienced?\" was produced by the band in conjunction with Ivan Stang of the Church of the SubGenius. The video featured Devo as floating blobs of wax in a lava lamp and Jimi Hendrix (played by Hendrix impersonator Randy Hansen) stepping out of his coffin to play a guitar solo, as well as the cover children Chase and Alex. Despite being one of Devo's most visually complex and expensive music videos, it wasn't included on the 2003 DVD music video collection \"The Complete Truth About De-Evolution\" (although it had been included on the LaserDisc of the same name issued in 1993). In an interview with Gerald Casale for Earcandymag.com, he explained:\nE.C.: Speaking of de-evolution, why didn't the Hendrix estate give you permission to put the \"Are You Experienced?\" video on the DVD?\n\nGerald Casale: Further de-evolution. You understand that the consortium of people that now represent the Hendrix estate are basically run by lawyers; the lawyer mentality. Lawyers always posit the worst-case scenarios. Though that video was loved for years by anybody who saw it including the man who commissioned it —Chuck Arroff, a luminary in the music business, who still claims to this day that it was one of his five most favorite videos ever—, they [the lawyers] didn't get it and assumed we were making fun of Jimi. That's like saying \"Whip It\" makes fun of cowboys. This is so stupid it's unbelievable.\"\nAs the band were dropped by their record label and went on hiatus following \"Shout\"'s release, there was no tour to promote it. The only songs to be performed live from the album are the title track, as part of the \"Somewhere With Devo\" suite performed from 1988 to 1991, and a one-off performance of \"Here to Go\" in 1991. Devo had apparently planned a tour show with a video projection backdrop, similar to the \"Oh, No! It's Devo\" tour of 1982.\n\nThe album received very negative reviews upon its release. Writing for The Village Voice, music journalist Robert Christgau stated, \"Marking time (actually, a computer marks it for them), they create the rock--no, new wave--equivalent of baseball's 'Play me or trade me.' I played it. Now I'm trading it.\"\n\nMark Deming of AllMusic retrospectively called it a \"forgettable, slick and glossy product with all human surfaces stripped away.\"\n\nNotes\n\nDevo\n\nProduction\n\n"}

{"id": "2017462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017462", "title": "Grand Marais, Michigan", "text": "Grand Marais, Michigan\n\nGrand Marais is an unincorporated community in Burt Township, Alger County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located on Lake Superior, and is the eastern gateway to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore via H-58.\n\nThe name \"Grand Marais\" (French: great marsh) is a reference to the large, shallow harbor. French explorers used the word \"marais\" to mean \"harbor of refuge\" as well as \"marsh.\"\n\nA breakwater was later built that extends from the bay into Lake Superior. The Grand Marais Outer Range Light is at its end, and the Fresnel lens is still operative. It is one of only 70 such lenses that remain operational in the United States; 16 of these are in use on the Great Lakes, eight of which are in Michigan. Many controversies in the little town relate to the costs of dredging and breakwall-repair operations to keep the harbor functioning.\n\nGrand Marais was one of five U.S. Life-Saving Service Stations established along the coast of Lake Superior between Munising and Whitefish Point in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was part of the U.S. Life-Saving Service District 10 (later part of District 11). The other four Life-saving Stations were Deer Park, Two Heart, Crisp Point Light, and Vermilion Point. In 1915, these stations became part of the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1939 the U.S. Lighthouse Service also merged under the control of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThe community was home to the Grand Marais Air Force Station from 1954 to 1957. The station was part of the Air Defense Command, and provided general surveillance radar along the northern frontier of the United States.\n\nGrand Marais is the northern terminus of M-77.

Before World War II he lived in Skopje, Zagreb and Belgrade, working as a literary critic and a secondary school teacher, and joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. His first book of poetry, \"Glineni golubovi\" (Clay Pigeons, 1937), was banned by the Yugoslav royal regime.\n\nHe joined the Partisans in 1941, and after World War II he was briefly one of the most prominent figures in Yugoslav government, as head of the propaganda of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, authoring several programmatic and polemical articles and criticism from the standpoint of dogmatic real socialism (\"Na poprištu\", \"At the scene\", 1948). He was expelled from the League of Communists and put under house arrest in 1948 in connection with the Tito-Stalin split. He was accused of being Stalinist and for Montenegrin nationalism among else.\n\nIn the late 1960s Zogović was semi-rehabilitated, and in that period his best works were published: poetry collections \"Prkosne strofe\" (\"Defiant verses\", 1947), \"Žilama za kamen\" (\"Veins for the rock\"), \"Artikulisana riječ\" (\"Articulated word\", 1965), \"Lično, sasvim lično\" (\"Personal, very personal\"), \"Noć i pola vijeka\" (\"A night and half a century\", 1978) and \"Knjaževska kancelarija\" (The Prince's Office). He also wrote the novel \"Pejsaži i nešto se dešava\" (\"The landscape and something happens\", 1968).\nHis poetry at first was very socially engaged, critical and polemical towards social reality, while in the later songs predominate landscape and homeland motifs and reflection on youth, the passage of time and fate.\nHis poems have been translated in many languages, and he himself translated works from Russian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Macedonian authors, including Vladimir Mayakovsky, Anna Akhmatova and Nazim Hikmet.\n\nAmong his close friends were the Serbian poet Desanka Maksimović and the Montenegrin novelist Mihailo Lalić.\nHe was a member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts.\n\nHe died of cancer on 5 January 1986 in Belgrade.\n\nHis wife Vera (who died in 2003) was also a translator from Russian, and his daughter Mirka from Italian.\n\n"}

Early on he became personal bodyguard of Ahmed Yassin, one of the founders of Hamas and one of its spiritual leaders. He quickly took charge of a small group of militants and led several attacks against the IDF in the Gaza strip, which claimed the lives of at least two soldiers.\n\nIdentified as a top leader of the brigades by 1995, Wa'el Nassar prepared to carry out a suicide bombing, but failed to infiltrate Israel and his plan was foiled. Placed on the list of people to kill or arrest by the IDF, Nassar was chased by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was at that time engaged in a peace process with Israel, and arrested in 1996 by the PA. He was then placed in administrative detention and was released at the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada.\n\nLiving clandestinely in Gaza, Wa'el Nassar then recovered as a top leader of Hamas' brigades and led many cells of terrorists which carried out several sophisticated and lethal attacks against Israeli settlers and soldiers in Gaza. From 2000 to his death, Nassar directed operations that claimed, according to Hamas and IDF sources, the lives of at least 27 Israeli soldiers or civilians. \n\nInjured in 2001, when the mortar crew he led was hit by an Israeli missile fired from a helicopter, he recovered and masterminded several important terrorist operations. Among others, Nassar planned the suicide bombing carried out by Reem El-Reyashi on 14 January 2004, the first ever Hamas' female suicide bomber, which killed four Israeli soldiers at the Erez checkpoint north of the Gaza Strip. He was also blamed for the 21 March 2004, bombing of Ashdod, in southern Israel, which claimed the lives of 10 civilians and triggered an IDF reprisal which killed Hamas' spiritual leader and founder, sheik Ahmed Yasin.\n\nActively searched for by Israel, Nassar, living in hiding, continued to lead groups of Hamas fighters and was reportedly in charge of the cell that detonated a powerful bomb under an Israeli armoured personnel carrier (APC) in Gaza City's Zeitun neighborhood, which killed 6 IDF soldiers during an Israeli incursion on 12 May 2004. Nassar's cell then collected body parts of the killed soldiers and exchanged them to Israel following their display in video. Vowing to avenge the soldier's deaths, Israel marked Nassar for death and actively searched for his whereabouts. On 30 May 2004, Wa'el Nassar was riding a motorcycle in Zeitun following an operation against an Israeli settlement when an IDF drone fired a missile at the vehicle, killing him and his assistant Mohammed Sarsour, as well as a bystander.\n"}

It is the home of the Vancouver Convention Centre, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver's World Trade Centre, and the virtual flight ride FlyOver Canada. The building's exterior is covered by fabric roofs resembling sails. It is also the main cruise ship passenger terminal for the region, where cruises to Alaska originate. The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.\n\nCanada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.\n\nThe structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth. In 2009/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.\n\nCanada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour.\n\nDuring Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada.

The ten horns have five facing north and five facing east on the roof of the Pan Pacific hotel and have an output of 115 Decibels. They were the brainchild of Les Southwell, designed and constructed by Robert Swanson for Canada's centennial 1967, and funded by BC Hydro. They were originally on the roof of the BC Hydro building (now The Electra) and were silent when the headquarters was converted to condominiums in the early 1990s. The horns started sounding again on November 8, 1994 after being acquired, refurbished, and relocated to Canada Place. Due to complaints, the timer was changed from mechanical to electrical soon after to make them accurate. They sounded 26 times during the 2010 Olympics, once for each medal won by Canada. The first was at 7:30pm on February 13 for a silver won by Jennifer Heil. The Heritage Horns will also be sounding at 7:00 p.m. each evening from March 26 to April 16, 2020 in support of essential service workers across Canada.

{"id": "2017552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017552", "title": "Henry Murray", "text": "Henry Murray\n\nHenry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) was an American psychologist at Harvard University, where from 1959 to 1962 he conducted a series of psychologically-damaging experiments on undergraduate students, one of whom was Ted Kaczynski, later known as the Unabomber. He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930. Murray developed a theory of personality called personology, based on \"need\" and \"press\". Murray was also a co-developer, with Christiana Morgan, of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which he referred to as \"the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music.\" \n\nMurray was born in New York City into a wealthy family of Henry Alexander Murray, Sr., and Fannie Morris Babcock, daughter of financier Samuel Denison Babcock. Murray had an older sister and a younger brother. Carver and Scheier note that \"he got on well with his father but had a poor relationship with his mother\", resulting in a deep-seated feeling of depression. They hypothesize that the disruption of this relationship led Murray to be especially aware of people's needs and their importance as underlying determinants of behavior.\n\nAt Harvard, he majored in history with a poor performance, but compensated with football, rowing and boxing. At Columbia University he did much better in medicine, completed his M.D. and also received an M.A. in biology, in 1919. For the next two years he was an instructor in physiology at Harvard. \nHe received his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in 1928, aged 35.\n\nIn 1916, Murray married, aged 23, and after seven years of marriage, in 1923, he met and fell in love with Christiana Morgan. He experienced a serious conflict as he did not want to leave his wife, Josephine. This was a turning point in Murray's life as it raised his awareness of conflicting needs, the pressure that can result, and the links to motivation. Carver and Scheier note that it was Morgan who was \"fascinated by the psychology of Carl Jung\" and it was as a result of her urging that he met Carl Jung in Switzerland. He described Jung as \"The first full blooded, spherical—and Goethean, I would say, intelligence I had ever met.\" He was analyzed by him and studied his works. \"The experience of bringing a problem to a psychologist and receiving an answer that seemed to work had a great impact on Murray, leading him to seriously consider psychology as a career\".\n\nDuring his period at Harvard, Murray sat in on lectures by Alfred North Whitehead, whose process philosophy marked his philosophical and metaphysical thinking throughout his professional career.\n\nIn 1927, at the age of 33, Murray became assistant director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), \"press\" (external influences on motivation) and \"thema\"—\"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions\". \n\nMurray collaborated with Stanley Cobb, Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna. He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.\nIn 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the Thematic apperception test. They used the term \"apperception\" to refer to the process of projecting fantasy imagery onto an objective stimulus.\n\nIn 1937, Murray became director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. \nIn 1938 he published \"Explorations in Personality\", a classic in psychology, which includes a description of the Thematic Apperception Test. \nIn 1938 Murray acted as a consultant for the British Government, setting up the Officer Selection Board. Murray's work at The Harvard Psychological Clinic enabled him to apply his theories in the design of the selection processes with a \"situation test\", an assessment based on practical tasks and activities, an analysis of \"specific criteria\" (e.g. \"leadership\") by a number of raters across a range of activities. Results were pooled to achieve an overall assessment.\n\nDuring World War II, he left Harvard and worked as lieutenant colonel for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). James Miller, in charge of the selection of secret agents at the OSS during World War ll, said the situation test was used by British War Officer Selection Board and OSS to assess potential agents.\n\nIn 1943 Murray helped complete \"Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler\", commissioned by OSS boss MGen. William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan. The report was done in collaboration with psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer, Dr. Ernst Kris, New School for Social Research, and Dr. Bertram D. Lewin, New York Psychoanalytic Institute. The report used many sources to profile Hitler, including informants such as Ernst Hanfstaengl, Hermann Rauschning, Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, Gregor Strasser, Friedelinde Wagner, and Kurt Ludecke. The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of offender profiling and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as heterosexual relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a homosexual relationship. The report stated: \"The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many feminine characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the Party during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions. It is probably true that Hitler calls Albert Forster \"Bubi\", which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners.\"\n\nIn 1947, he returned to Harvard as a chief researcher, lectured and established with others the \"Psychological Clinic Annex\".\n\nFrom late 1959 to early 1962, Murray was responsible for unethical experiments in which he used twenty-two Harvard undergraduates as research subjects. \nAmong other goals, experiments sought to measure individuals' responses to extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray called \"vehement, sweeping and personally abusive\" attacks. Specifically-tailored assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were used to cause high levels of stress and distress. The subjects then viewed recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse repeatedly.\n\nAmong them was 17-year-old Ted Kaczynski, a mathematician who went on to become the Unabomber, a domestic terrorist targeting academics and technologists for 18 years. Alston Chase's book \"Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist\" connects Kaczynski's abusive experiences under Murray to his later criminal career.\n\nIn 1960, Timothy Leary started research in psychedelic drugs at Harvard, which Murray is said to have supervised.\n\nSome sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of, or indemnified by, the US Government's research into mind control known as the MKUltra project.\n\nIn 1962, Murray became emeritus professor, and earned the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Gold Medal Award for lifetime achievement from the American Psychological Foundation.\n\nMurray died from pneumonia at the age of 95.\n\nMurray was a leading authority on the works of American author Herman Melville and amassed a collection of books, manuscripts and artifacts relating to Melville which he donated to the Berkshire Athenaeum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nMurray's Theory of Personality, also called \"personology\", is explained in his book, \"Explorations in Personality\", written in 1938. Murray's system of needs is an important part of the personological system. and developed while personality theory in psychology was becoming dominated by the statistics of trait theory. Patterned after chemistry's Henderson–Hasselbalch equation for the pH of a solution, personology was a holistic approach that studied the person at many levels of complexity all at the same time by an interdisciplinary team of investigators.\n\nAccording to Murray's ideas, an individual's personality develops dynamically as each person responds to complex elements in her or his specific environment. Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \"personology\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.\n\nMurray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.\n\nMurray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists, and extended by others, such as D. C. McClelland.\n\nMurray's identification of psychological needs, the Murray's system of needs, including Achievement, Affiliation and Power (1938) provided the theoretical basis for the later research of David McClelland and underpins development of competency-based models of management effectiveness such as Richard Boyatzis's. McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature.\n\n\"Explorations in Personality\" underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T in the development of the Assessment Centre methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.\n\n\nArticles\n\nReports\n\n"}

{"id": "2017602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017602", "title": "Reforma", "text": "Reforma\n\nReforma is a Mexican newspaper based in Mexico City. It has 276,700 readers in Mexico City. The paper shares content with other papers in its parent newsgroup \"Grupo Reforma\". The cumulative readership of the newsgroup is above 400,000. \"Reforma\" is named after the Mexico City avenue of the same name, Paseo de la Reforma, which is in turn named after \"La Reforma\", a series of liberal reforms undertaken by the country in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe newspaper emphasizes its design, variety of columnists, and editorials that denounce political corruption. \"Reforma\", along with the other newspapers of its parent, have an interest in color printing.\n\nThe paper features weekly translations from selected articles of local interest from U.S. newspapers. These include \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\". The Sunday edition of \"Reforma\" formerly included a supplemental magazine titled \"Top Magazzine,\" which covered celebrity gossip, Hollywood previews and interviews.\n\n\"Reforma\" was founded in 1993, as an offshoot of \"El Norte\", the noted Monterrey-based daily. \"Reforma\" was the first newsgroup in Mexico to separate its commercial division from its journalism division. This allows for a greater independence in journalism and helps journalists resist the temptation of writing favorable notes on sponsors.\n\nWhen it was founded, on November 20, the newspaper pressured unionized newsstands to sell the paper on that day. Since November 20 is the Mexican Revolution day, an obligatory public holiday in México, the unions refused, and so, that day's edition of \"Reforma\" had to be sold on the streets by journalists and celebrities to protest against what they considered \"a boycott\".\n\n\"Reforma\" changed the traditional distribution of newspapers because of its independence from the unionized newsstands and printed media resellers. It also was innovative because of the inclusion of people of all political opinions in its editorial pages.\n\nThe newsgroup is 85 years old. It all started with the founding of \"El Sol\" in April 1922, followed by \"El Norte\" in 1938, Monterrey's \"Metro\" in 1988, \"Reforma\" in 1993, \"Palabra\" and Mexico City's \"Metro\" in 1997, \"Mural\" in 1998, Saltillo's \"Metro\" in 2004 and Guadalajara's \"Metro\" in 2005.\n\nGrupo Refoma's independent journalism drew the ire of the powerful Mexico City's carrier union barely a year after it was born. This syndicate controls distribution of all newspapers in the capital city and was traditionally used by the political system to bring down any paper that was deemed unacceptable. The carrier union boycotted the distribution of Reforma in Mexico City in October 1994. Grupo Reforma decided to create an independent distribution channel to sell Reforma on Mexico City's streets. The support of the readers was incredible: intellectuals, artists and regular folk joined Reforma's personnel in the process to create this independent distribution channel. Dozens of people went onto the streets to sell the paper, withstanding the verbal and even physical violence of the carrier union. Currently, Reforma is distributed independently to the homes of 85,000 subscribers, to supermarkets and other retail outlets and to readers in Mexico City's streets. The paper's daily circulation averages 200,000 copies.\n\nGrupo Reforma's dailies have an open journalism model that is very different from any other newspaper's in the world. One of the cornerstones of this model is its editorial boards. Each section of each of the papers has an editorial board, which is a group of readers and leaders in that section's area of interest who get together weekly or bi-monthly to set the section's editorial agenda. For example, the editorial board of Reforma's national section may include a diputado (member of the house of representatives), a senator, several politicians, some members of NGOs, as well as normal readers, like housewives, students, etc...\n\nThe boards have complete liberty of action in deciding what the paper is covering. Each board is led by its section's editor. This way, the board members on each board are working with the person who is directly responsible for the daily operation of each section.\n\nEach board session is divided in two parts. In the first one, the board members criticize the content of the section since the last time they met. What was done right? What needs to be corrected? What was plainly wrong? These and other similar topics are dealt with in this first discussion.\n\nDuring the next step in the session, the discussion centers on the work ahead. What stories should the section be working on? Who should the paper be interviewing? Are there any events that are worth covering? It is in this part of the meeting where the editorial agenda is defined by the group.\n\nEach year, 850 people are part of the 70 editorial boards that define the editorial agenda for all of Grupo Reforma's papers. More than 8 thousand people have been members of an editorial board during the 15 years that they have been in operation. Participation is voluntary, so no payment is given to the board members. The \"payment\" they receive is in seeing how they indeed are setting the agenda for some of the most influential newspapers in Mexico and in participating in a collaboration potentially able to transform Mexico. The boards are renewed every year, but a couple of the members are chosen by the same board to stay on, so there is some continuity with any work in progress that was left behind. Every quarter, the editor gives his/her board a balance of all the suggestions they've provided and how they have been implemented in the section.\n\nThe newspaper insists, like the other publications of the editorial group, that it is non-partisan, with an editorial style favoring an ostensibly neutral point of view and publishing opinions from journalists of all political positions (such as Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa from the left, and Sergio Sarmiento from the right). Additionally, the newspaper alleges to have many fail-safes in place to prevent any partisan point of view.\n\nDespite its avowed independent editorial style, Reforma has been labeled as a right-wing newspaper in references by \"The Guardian\", the \"Clarin\", the \"San Antonio Express-News\", the University of Miami school of communication and the Princeton Progressive Nation. Mexican president Andres Manuel López Obrador (as a presidential candidate in 2005) also accused the paper of this bias, and even denounced the paper of being a \"press bulletin for the PAN\". However, the paper itself has columnists who openly support Andrés Manuel López Obrador, such as Guadalupe Loaeza, Lorenzo Meyer and Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa.\n\nAnother alleged bias of the newspaper is its being in favor of privatizing the Electrical Utilities (CFE,LyF). After the Enron collapse, this bias has diminished.\n\n\n\"Reforma\" is part of the Grupo Reforma. Grupo Reforma is a collection of Mexican media outlets. Within Grupo Reforma, \"Reforma\" is an offshoot of \"El Norte\".\n\n\n\n"}

The producers and songwriters of Music Instructor were Mike Michaels, Mark \"MM\" Dollar, and Mark Tabak, also known as Triple-M Crew. Triple-M has also produced other artists and bands such as Brainbug, Flying Steps, Mystica, Highland, The Boyz, Overground, Before Four, US5 and Ayman. Music Instructor often worked with many other artists, especially a group Lunatics and a breakdance crew Flying Steps, and was most active in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAt first, the group made dance music similar to happy hardcore with the singer Holly Trance. Their first single was a cover of \"Hymn\", originally performed by Ultravox. It was released in 1995, and was followed by the album \"The World of Music Instructor\" in 1996 with three more singles – \"Hands in the Air\", \"Dream a Little Dream\" and \"Dance\". They also released the single \"Friends Will Be Friends\", which was a cover of Queen's song of the same title and appeared in the compilation \"Queen Dance Traxx\".\n\nAt the time of the regrowing popularity of electro music in 1998, Music Instructor became an electro project, and released the album \"Electric City of Music Instructor\" with the singles \"Super Sonic\", \"Rock Your Body\", \"Get Freaky\" and \"Electric City\". The first three singles featured the German breakdance collective Flying Steps, and \"Get Freaky\" featured the German hip-hop band Lunatics. For \"Get Freaky\", a special single edit was made, different from the original song, and the character Abe from the \"Oddworld\" video games appeared in videos for both singles. \"Super Sonic\"'s single version was also slightly different from the album version. The first edition of this album was called \"Electro City\" and contained the original version instead of the single edits. The album also featured the \"Music Instructor Megamix\" and covers of Newcleus' \"Jam on It\", Freestyle's \"Don't Stop the Rock\", Jonzun Crew's \"Pack Jam (Look Out for the OVC)\" and Shannon's \"Let the Music Play\".\n\nAfter the second album, the group remixed DJ Session One's \"Dreams In My Fantasy\" and released the singles \"DJ's Rock Da House\" (1999), \"Super Fly (Upper MC)\" (featuring the rapper Dean Burke from Lunatics), \"Highland\" (2000), and \"Play My Music\" (featuring Veronique) (2001).\n\n"}

{"id": "2017636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017636", "title": "Set packing", "text": "Set packing\n\nSet packing is a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory and combinatorics, and was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.\n\nSuppose one has a finite set \"S\" and a list of subsets of \"S\". Then, the set packing problem asks if some \"k\" subsets in the list are pairwise disjoint (in other words, no two of them share an element).\n\nMore formally, given a universe formula_1 and a family formula_2 of subsets of formula_1,\na \"packing\" is a subfamily formula_4 of sets such that all sets in formula_5 are pairwise disjoint. The size of the packing is formula_6. In the set packing decision problem, the input is a pair formula_7 and an integer formula_8; the question is whether\nthere is a set packing of size formula_8 or more. In the set packing optimization problem, the input is a pair formula_7, and the task is to find a set packing that uses the most sets. \n\nThe problem is clearly in NP since, given \"k\" subsets, we can easily verify that they are pairwise disjoint in polynomial time.\n\nThe optimization version of the problem, maximum set packing, asks for the maximum number of pairwise disjoint sets in the list. It is a maximization problem that can be formulated naturally as an integer linear program, belonging to the class of packing problems.\n\nThe maximum set packing problem can be formulated as the following integer linear program.\nAs a simple example, suppose your kitchen contains a collection of different food ingredients (formula_1), and you have a cook-book with a collection of recipes ( formula_2). Each recipe requires a subset of the food ingredients. You want to prepare the largest possible collection of recipes from the cook-book. You are actually looking for a set-packing (formula_5) on (formula_14) - a collection of recipes whose sets of ingredients are pairwise disjoint.\n\nAs another example, suppose you're at a convention of foreign ambassadors, each of which speaks English and also various other languages. You want to make an announcement to a group of them, but because you don't trust them, you don't want them to be able to speak among themselves without you being able to understand them. To ensure this, you will choose a group such that no two ambassadors speak the same language, other than English. On the other hand you also want to give your announcement to as many ambassadors as possible. In this case, the elements of the set are languages other than English, and the subsets are the sets of languages spoken by a particular ambassador. If two sets are disjoint, those two ambassadors share no languages other than English. A maximum set packing will choose the largest possible number of ambassadors under the desired constraint. Although this problem is hard to solve in general, in this example a good heuristic is to choose ambassadors who only speak unusual languages first, so that not too many others are disqualified.\n\nThere is a weighted version of the set packing problem in which each subset is assigned a real weight and it is this weight we wish to maximize: formula_15\n\nIn our simple example above, we might weight the recipes according to the number of friends that love the resulting dishes, so that our dinner will please the largest number of friends. \n\nThis seems to make the problem harder, but most known results for the unweighted problem apply to the weighted problem as well.\n\nThe set packing problem may be hard for some \"k\", but it's not hard to find a \"k\" for which it is easy on a particular input. For example, we can use a greedy algorithm where we look for the set which intersects the smallest number of other sets, add it to our solution, and remove the sets it intersects. We continually do this until no sets are left, and we have a set packing of some size, although it may not be the maximum set packing. Although no algorithm can always produce results close to the maximum (see next section), on many practical inputs these heuristics do so.\n\nThe set packing problem is not only NP-complete, but its optimization version (general maximum set packing problem) has been proven as difficult to approximate as the maximum clique problem; in particular, it cannot be approximated within any constant factor. The best known algorithm approximates it within a factor of formula_16.\nThe weighted variant can also be approximated as well.\n\nHowever, the problem does have a variant which is more tractable: if we assume no subset exceeds \"k\"≥3 elements, the answer can be approximated within a factor of \"k\"/2 + ε for any ε > 0; in particular, the problem with 3-element sets can be approximated within about 50%. In another more tractable variant, if no element occurs in more than \"k\" of the subsets, the answer can be approximated within a factor of \"k\". This is also true for the weighted version.\n\nThere is a one-to-one polynomial-time reduction between the independent set problem and the set packing problem:\n\nThis is also a bidirectional PTAS reduction, and it shows that the two problems are equally difficult to approximate.\n\nMatching and 3-dimensional matching are special cases of set packing. A maximum-size matching can be found in polynomial time, but finding a largest 3-dimensional matching or a largest independent set is NP-hard.\n\nSet packing is one among a family of problems related to covering or partitioning the elements of a set. One closely related problem is the set cover problem. Here, we are also given a set \"S\" and a list of sets, but the goal is to determine whether we can choose \"k\" sets that together contain every element of \"S\". These sets may overlap. The optimization version finds the minimum number of such sets. The maximum set packing need not cover every possible element.\n\nThe NP-complete exact cover problem, on the other hand, requires every element to be contained in exactly one of the subsets. Finding such an exact cover at all, regardless of size, is an NP-complete problem. However, if we create a singleton set for each element of \"S\" and add these to the list, the resulting problem is about as easy as set packing.\n\nKarp originally showed set packing NP-complete via a reduction from the clique problem.\n\nSee also: Packing in a hypergraph.\n\n\n"}

The show on 105 The Ticket makes up the third hour of \"The Tom Barnard Podcast\" known as \"The Ticket\" where the first two hours of the podcast is known as \"The Show\". As of February, 2014, the podcast was no longer broadcast on 105 The Ticket\n\nBarnard was born in Long Prairie, Minnesota and raised in North Minneapolis. He and his wife Kathryn Brandt live in Edina, Minnesota.\n\nBefore coming to KQRS, Barnard worked at numerous stations including WDGY and KSTP (as \"The Catman\"). Until 1986, he was the booth announcer for KSTP-TV.\n\nBarnard, and then-partner Dan Culhane, started the \"Tom and Dan\" show in 1986 featuring sports reports from WCCO-TV sports anchor Mark Rosen. At one point, the team of Barnard and Culhane spearheaded a write-in campaign to elect Rosen For Governor of Minnesota. Culhane was eventually pushed out of the broadcast in a personnel move, while Rosen was \"persuaded\" by WCCO TV's parent company to move his morning sports to WCCO-AM.\n\nBarnard is known for being very reclusive, refusing virtually all media interviews and rarely making public appearances. He did however recently give an in-depth interview to the St. Paul Pioneer Press in which he discussed his strained relationship with his deceased father and compared his radio persona to that of his actual personality. Earlier in his career, Barnard and Culhane were guests with two other Twin Cities radio show duos on a local morning television show in 1988.\n\nWith podcasting technology, the KQRS Morning Show has reached national and international audiences. Regardless of the growth in his show's market, Barnard continuously assures listeners that the show will maintain its focus on the news, weather, sports and traffic of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.\n\nAlthough he is semi-retired from voice-over work, Barnard can currently be heard in radio ads for Home Depot. For many years Barnard's voice was heard in various markets, introducing shows and appearing on commercials.\n\nOn September 29, 2009's Morning Show wrap-up, Barnard casually mentioned that he's planning to retire from live radio on December 21, 2012.

It is a spiritual sequel to \"\" released two years earlier. Despite the similarities between the two games, the development team designed a new game engine for \"Battle for Naboo\" and included land- and water-based combat in addition to aerial combat.\n\nSet in the fictional \"Star Wars\" galaxy, the game takes place during the events depicted in the film \"\". Players control Gavyn Sykes, a lieutenant in Naboo's Royal Security Forces. As the game progresses, Sykes and the Royal Security Forces fight the Trade Federation in 15 missions that take place on Naboo or in the space surrounding it. The game concludes after the player completes a mission that recreates the film's climactic assault on the Trade Federation's Droid Control Ship.\n\n\"Battle for Naboo\" was published by LucasArts and THQ and released for the Nintendo 64 in . A Windows port was released three months later in . The Nintendo 64 version received generally positive reviews; critics praised the game's tight and responsive controls, but expressed dislike for the game's \"Episode I\" setting. The game's PC port was less well-received, with critics citing poor visuals and difficult controls.\n\nA follow-up to \"\", \"Battle for Naboo\" is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15 levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).\n\nThe heads-up display features a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, land and water vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.\n\nThe player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against four medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved, number of bonuses collected and lives remaining. If a player's performance exceeds one of the level's four benchmarks in all five categories, a medal—bronze, silver, gold or platinum—is awarded on completion. Unlike other medal benchmarks, platinum medal benchmarks are undisclosed to the player. Acquiring medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content.\n\n\"Battle for Naboo\" includes a number of unlockable secrets. The player can unlock three bonus levels: \"Trade Federation Secrets\", \"Coruscant Encounter\" and \"Dark Side\". These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze, silver or gold medals, respectively, on every level. Alternatively, they can be unlocked via password. Several craft are also available when unlocked. The Sith Infiltrator, a Swamp Speeder and an AAT may be selected when the player enters the correct passwords or achieves all gold or platinum medals, respectively, on all levels. A TIE fighter and a playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, can be unlocked via password only.\n\nThe development team also included early game design sketches and audio commentary for each of the game's 15 standard levels, unlockable via passwords. Each level features more than five minutes of audio that totals over an hour of commentary in all. IGN likened the \"captivating\" commentary to DVD bonus material and believed the addition could start a trend in video games. MTV reporter Stephen Totilo believes that this audio commentary \"may very well be\" the earliest in video gaming.\n\n\"Battle for Naboo\" takes place in the fictional \"Star Wars\" galaxy. The overarching conflict is an escalating battle between the Trade Federation and the people of Naboo. All 15 missions occur during the events depicted in \"\". The taxation of trade routes is in dispute and the Trade Federation has sent an invasion force to the planet's capital city of Theed hoping to capture the planet and steal its resources. The planet's queen, Padmé Amidala, has left the city for Coruscant to try to gain support from the Galactic Senate. To help defend the planet, Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes must form a resistance movement.\n\nThe game starts with an opening crawl resembling the ones featured in the \"Star Wars\" films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, characters' conversations during the game and in-game cut scenes. During the Trade Federation's initial invasion of Theed, Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes and Captain Kael are able to escape the capital and head into the surrounding farmland. The two attempt to protect civilian farmers, but Federation presence is too strong, and they retreat into the nearby swamps. There they learn of a smuggler hidden in the mountains who might aid them. With the help of farmer Ved Deviss, Sykes and Kael find Borvo the Hutt. Borvo agrees to assist the resistance movement against the Trade Federation after the group helps him escape Federation forces.\n\nIn their first strike against the Trade Federation, Kael, Sykes, Ved, Lutin Hollis and Kol Kotha, a mercenary agent of Borvo's, destroy the communications satellite Comm 4. The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation base on the planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.\n\nHowever, during the escort mission, Kael disappears and Sykes begins a search and rescue mission for the missing Captain. Sykes discovers a mortally wounded Kael near his crashed fighter, and it is revealed that Borvo had shot down Kael after he'd learned of the Hutt's secret plan to sell the escaped prisoners into slavery. Seeking vengeance and the freedom of his people, Sykes hunts down Borvo, assisted by a disgruntled Kotha who disagrees with Borvo's betrayal. Though the Hutt is able to escape to Nal Hutta, the prisoners are saved.\n\nNow in charge of the resistance on Naboo, Sykes leads a mission to liberate the Camp 4, a detention center where the Trade Federation has placed most of Naboo's important leaders. After the camp is freed, Sykes is contacted by Captain Panaka, and the plan to finally liberate Naboo is set in motion. After taking part in the diversionary attack on Theed that allows Queen Amidala and Panaka to infiltrate the Palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, Sykes joins the rest of Bravo Flight in the climactic assault on the Droid Control Ship. Partnered with R2-C4, Sykes knocks out the Droid Control Ship's Shield Generator, which allows young Anakin Skywalker to destroy the ship from within. With the Trade Federation army disabled, Naboo is freed.\n\nWith \"\" and \"\" already released under a three-game exclusivity agreement signed by Nintendo, LucasArts began planning for the third and final game. After the success of \"Rogue Squadron\" in 1998, LucasArts and Factor 5 started initial testing for a follow-up in February 1999. The team discussed how they could build on that success and began planning the development of a new game engine. Possible plot ideas involving the film \"\" were also discussed. After it was released in May 1999, the team watched the movie several times in an attempt to find interesting characters, situations and craft for the game. Factor 5 stated that tying a movie plot into a vehicle combat game was \"hard\". They included all the characters and vehicles from the movie they could, and attempted to mix these elements with entirely new content.\n\nDuring the development process, LucasArts supplied most of the art and level-design, while Factor 5 provided the programming, tools, sound, and most of the cut-scene and art post-production work. After contemplating the idea of reusing \"Rogue Squadron\" game engine, the team decided it was necessary to develop a new engine from scratch. Being more familiar with the Nintendo 64, Factor 5 was able to write \"Battle for Naboo\" microcode by identifying the previous engine's strengths and weaknesses. Factor 5 stated that many of \"Battle for Naboo\" technical aspects (such as a farther draw distance) \"simply would not have been possible\" using the \"Rogue Squadron\" engine. The game uses a particle system that was written in microcode for the Nintendo 64's Reality Signal Processor. The team first developed the technique to display falling snow in \"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine\", another Nintendo 64 game that was developed simultaneously by the company. The result allowed \"Battle for Naboo\" to have rain and the snow effects that display up to 3,000 particles at any given time without compromising the game's frame rate and without using the system's central processing unit. Explosions and fountains also use these particle effects.\n\nSkywalker Sound supplied the development team with sound directly from \"The Phantom Menace\" for use in \"Battle for Naboo\". Because its music is fully interactive and in real-time, the game required new material to be composed and pieces from the movie to be rewritten. Factor 5 again used its own sound drivers called MusyX to handle the game's sound, as it did with \"Rogue Squadron\" (then called MOsys FX Surround). The game includes voice work from voice actors Jeff Coopwood, Roger L. Jackson, Doug Boyd and Terry McGovern.\n\nUnlike \"Rogue Squadron\", which was developed and released for the Nintendo 64 and Windows simultaneously, \"Battle for Naboo\" was ported to Windows and released two months later. The Windows version features enhanced resolution and textures and includes a mouse-supported menu interface. On October 24, 2001, it was re-released as a part of the LucasArts Archive Series.\nMany reviews compared \"Battle for Naboo\" to \"\". \"GamePro\" remarked that the games share the same \"exciting aerial combat, sturdy controls, and ... absorbing story line\", and IGN's Fran Mirabella III wrote, \"\"Battle for Naboo\" proves to be a worthy follow up to \"Rogue\" by improving on nearly everything that held it back from perfection.\" EGM believed that, \"if you liked \"Rogue Squadron\", it's a good bet you'll like \"Naboo\" even more.\" GameSpot's Ryan Davis, however, thought that the game remained fun despite the \"general lack of innovation over its predecessor\" and believed it to be \"one of the best \"Episode I\" titles to hit the market\". The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews and received an aggregate score of 82 percent and 84 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively.\n\n\"Battle for Naboo\"s controls were described as tight and responsive. Reviewers praised the addition of ground vehicles, which were completely absent from \"Rogue Squadron\". Both Davis and Mirabella remarked that this addition keeps the game from getting stale or redundant. \"Nintendo Power\" thought that the game is at its best when the action isn't grounded, however, describing some of the ground missions as \"tedious\" and \"uninspired\". Some reviewers believed that the game's \"Episode I\" setting is less engaging than \"Rogue Squadron\"s original trilogy setting. Mirabella stated that \"any fan of \"Rogue Squadron\" should enjoy \"Battle for Naboo\" just as much if they can get past the \"Episode I\" barrier\", and Davis wrote that the game's setting \"does not carry the same impact as the story of the original [trilogy].\"\n\nThe game's visuals were a source of disagreement between some critics. \"Extended Play\"'s Matthew Keil wrote that the game's visuals are the \"most notable improvement\" over \"Rogue Squadron\". Mirabella agreed and went on to call \"Battle for Naboo\" \"one of the prettiest games to grace the N64.\" Both Keil and Mirabella praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and \"vastly\" improving the draw distance over \"Rogue Squadron\". Davis, however, wrote that \"the graphics in \"Battle for Naboo\" are exactly the same as those of \"Rogue Squadron\", flaws and all\", and \"Nintendo Power\"s Andy Meyers cited \"drab backgrounds and dry cinemas\". EGM enjoyed the game's models and lighting, but thought the environments looked \"blurry\". Reviewers' opinions on the game's music and sound effects were generally less divided. Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5's audio talents, and Mirabella and Davis described the audio as \"atmospheric\" and \"immersive\", respectively. One EGM reviewer lamented \"the low-quality cartridge \"Episode I\" music\", but another thought the sound was impressive.\n\nWith aggregated scores of 57 percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, \"Battle for Naboo\"s PC port garnered significantly lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Many complaints about the PC version stemmed from the fact that the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported. \"Computer Games Magazine\"s Adam Fleet thought the game was ugly, citing \"truly bland textures and sad-looking 2D sprites\". \"Next Generation\"s Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the \"graphics suck.\" Of the audio, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini wrote, \"[it] isn't that bad, but it isn't quite as good as the audio in other similar games\", and goes on to describe the music as sounding \"tinny.\" Varanini also took issue with the PC version's aiming controls, stating that because \"Battle for Naboo\" was originally designed for the Nintendo 64's analog controller, it is difficult to aim using a PC's digital keyboard. Preston agreed, writing that controlling the game is \"nearly impossible\" with a digital controller or mouse.\n"}

Bernstein. It can be used to verify the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. A variant of Bernstein's Poly1305 that does not require AES has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 8439.\n\nThe original proposal, Poly1305-AES, which uses AES block cipher to expand key, computes a 128-bit (16 bytes) authenticator of a variable-length message, using a 128-bit AES key, a 128-bit additional key (with 106 effective key bits), \"r\", and a 128-bit nonce. The message is broken into 16-byte chunks which become coefficients of a polynomial in \"r\", evaluated modulo the prime number 2−5. The name is derived from this and the use of 2−5 and the Advanced Encryption Standard. In NaCl Poly1305 is used with Salsa20 instead of AES, in TLS and SSH it is used with ChaCha20 keystream.\n\nGoogle has selected Poly1305 along with Bernstein's ChaCha20 symmetric cipher as a replacement for RC4 in TLS/SSL, which is used for Internet security. Google's initial implementation is used in securing https (TLS/SSL) traffic between the Chrome browser on Android phones and Google's websites. Use of ChaCha20/Poly1305 has been standardized in RFC 7905.\n\nShortly after Google's adoption for use in TLS, both ChaCha20 and Poly1305 support was added to OpenSSH via the chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com authenticated encryption cipher. Subsequently, this made it possible for OpenSSH to remove its dependency on OpenSSL through a compile-time option.\n\nThe security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the underlying AES block cipher algorithm. Consequently, the only way for an attacker to break Poly1305-AES is to break AES.\n\nPoly1305-AES can be computed at high speed in various CPUs: for an \"n\"-byte message, no more than 3.1n+780 Athlon cycles are needed, for example.\nThe author has released optimized source code for Athlon, Pentium Pro/II/III/M, PowerPC, and UltraSPARC, in addition to non-optimized reference implementations in C and C++ as public domain software.\n\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support Poly1305:\n\n\n"}

Although primarily remembered as a batsman, he began his career as a fast-medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, he was a very useful bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire.\n\nBorn in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Brockwell played his county cricket for the very strong Surrey side of the last years of the 19th century. He made his first-class debut against Derbyshire in 1886. He played only occasionally up to 1890, but established himself in 1891 and 1892, when Surrey were at the height of their powers as a county side. However, it was not until 1893 that Brockwell became a vital member of the Surrey eleven, when he took 51 wickets at the same cost as the incomparable Richardson and, despite often going in late, proving to be one of the most consistent batsmen. In the very wet 1894 season, Brockwell, despite the consistently treacherous pitches, made a remarkable advance. He scored more runs (1,491) than any other player, and hit five centuries, and consequently was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He declined a great deal in 1895, but from the following year up to 1899, formed a formidable batting trio with Bobby Abel and Tom Hayward that made Surrey invincible on the perfect Oval pitches.\n\nBrockwell played seven Test matches for England, all against Australia – one in 1893, five on the 1894/95 tour and a final match in 1899 – but was not a success at this level and averaged under 17 with a highest score of just 49.

{"id": "2017714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017714", "title": "Carlton House Terrace", "text": "Carlton House Terrace\n\nCarlton House Terrace is a street in the St James's district of the City of Westminster in London. Its principal architectural feature is a pair of terraces of white stucco-faced houses on the south side of the street overlooking St. James's Park. These terraces were built on Crown land between 1827 and 1832 to overall designs by John Nash, but with detailed input by other architects including Decimus Burton, who exclusively designed No. 3 and No.4.\n\nThe land on which Carlton House Terrace was built had once been part of the grounds of St James's Palace, known as \"the Royal Garden\" and \"the Wilderness\". The latter was at one time in the possession of Prince Rupert of the Rhine (cousin of Charles II), and was later called Upper Spring Garden.\n\nFrom 1700 the land was held by Henry Boyle, who spent £2,835 on improving the existing house in the Royal Garden. Queen Anne issued letters patent granting Boyle a lease for a term of 31 years from 2 November 1709 at £35 per annum. Boyle was created Baron Carleton in 1714, and the property has been called after him since then, although at some point the \"e\" was dropped.\n\nOn Carleton's death the lease passed to his nephew, the architect and aesthete Lord Burlington, and in January 1731 George II issued letters patent granting Burlington a reversionary lease for a further term of 40 years at an annual rent of £35. By an indenture dated 23 February 1732 the lease was assigned to Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II, who predeceased his father, dying in 1751; his widow, Augusta, continued living in the house, making alterations and purchasing an adjoining property to enlarge the site. She died in 1772 and the house devolved to her son, George III.\n\nThe property was granted by George III to his eldest son, George, Prince of Wales (later Prince Regent) on the latter's coming of age in 1783. The Prince spent enormous sums on improving and enlarging the property, running up huge debts. He was at loggerheads with his father, and the house became a rival Court, and was the scene of a brilliant social life.\n\nWhen the Prince became King George IV in 1820 he moved to Buckingham Palace. Instructions were given in 1826 to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests that \"Carlton Palace\" should be given up to the public, be demolished and the site and gardens laid out as building ground for \"dwelling houses of the First Class\". By 1829 the Commissioners reported that the site was completely cleared and that part of it had already been let on building leases. Materials from the demolition were sold by public auction, with some fixtures transferred to Windsor Castle and to \"The King's House, Pimlico\". Columns of the portico were re-used in the design for the new National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, interior Ionic columns were moved to the conservatories of Buckingham Palace, and some of the armorial stained glass was incorporated in windows of Windsor Castle.\n\nAfter Carlton House was demolished the development of its former site was originally intended to be part of a scheme for improving St James's Park. For this John Nash proposed three terraces of houses along the north of the Park, balanced by three along the south side, overlooking Birdcage Walk. None of the three southern terraces and only two of the three northern ones were built, the latter being the west (No.1–9) and east (No. 10–18) sections of Carlton House Terrace. These two blocks were designed by Nash and Decimus Burton, with James Pennethorne in charge of the construction. Decimus Burton exclusively, without Nash, designed No. 3 and No. 4. Carlton House Terrace. These elegant townhouses took the place of Carlton House, and the freehold still belongs to the Crown Estate. Nash planned to make contiguous the two blocks with a large domed fountain between them (re-using the old columns of the Carlton House portico), but the idea was vetoed by the King; the present-day Duke of York's Steps took the place of the fountain. In 1834 the Duke of York's Column was erected at the top of the steps. It consists of a granite column designed by Benjamin Wyatt topped with a bronze statue by Richard Westmacott of Frederick, Duke of York.\nThe terraces, which are four storeys in height above a basement, were designed in a classical style, stucco clad, with a Corinthian columned façade overlooking St James's Park, surmounted by an elaborate frieze and pediment. At the south side, facing the park, the lower frontage has a series of squat Doric columns, supporting a substantial podium terrace at a level between the street entrances to the north and the ground floor level of the modern Mall. The houses are unusual as they are expensive London terraces which have no mews to the rear. The reason for this was that Nash wanted the houses to make the best possible use of the view of the park, and also to present an attractive façade to the park. The service accommodation was placed underneath the podium and in two storeys of basements (rather than the usual one storey).\n\nAccording to the architectural historian Sir John Summerson Nash's designs were inspired by Ange-Jacques Gabriel's buildings in the Place de la Concorde, Paris. Summerson's praise of the buildings is muted:\nThe authors of the Survey of London take a more favourable view:\nAlthough Nash delegated the supervision of building to Pennethorne, he kept the letting of the sites firmly in his own hands. Ground rents, payable to the Crown, were set at the high rate of 4 guineas per foot frontage. Nash himself took leases of five sites – nos 11–15 intending to let them on the open market at a substantial profit. In the event he could not cover his total costs and made a small loss on the transactions.\n\nIn the 20th century the Terrace came under threat of partial or complete demolition and redevelopment, as were country houses at that time. By the 1930s there was little demand for large central London houses, and the Commissioners of Crown Lands were having difficulty in letting the properties. Two properties were let to clubs: no 1 to the Savage Club and no 16 to Crockford's gambling club, but residential tenants became hard to find. Proposals for redevelopment were put forward by the architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, who had earlier been one of those responsible for replacing Nash's Regent Street buildings with larger structures in the Edwardian neo-classical style. Blomfield proposed rebuilding \"in a manner suitable for hotels, large company offices, flats and similar purposes\". The suggested new buildings were to be two storeys higher than Nash's houses, and there was an outcry that persuaded the Commissioners not to proceed with the scheme.\n\nThe Terrace was severely damaged by German bombing during the Second World War. In the 1950s the British government considered acquiring the Terrace as the site for a new Foreign Office headquarters. The Nash façades were to be preserved, but it was widely felt that the height of the redevelopment behind them would be unacceptable.\n\nThe Terrace has had many famous residents, including:\n\nMost of the houses are now occupied by businesses, institutes and learned societies.\n\nThe Crown Estate had its headquarters for many years in four houses in the Terrace (Numbers 13–16). However, the organisation moved in 2006 to another property that it owns in New Burlington Place, an alleyway off Regent Street. In 2006, the Hinduja family purchased the vacated property for £58 million.\n\nAt the west end of the Carlton House Terrace is a cul-de-sac called Carlton Gardens, which was developed at around the same time. It contained seven large houses. Robert Loyd-Lindsay, founder of the British Red Cross inherited Number 2 from his father-in-law Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone in 1883, and it remained his London residence until his death in 1901. His widow Lady Wantage later briefly leased Number 2 to Lord Kitchener. Number 4 was home to Lord Palmerston for a time and later served as Charles de Gaulle's government in exile, Free France. \n\nAll the houses except numbers 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced by office blocks. Number 1 is an official ministerial residence normally used by the Foreign Secretary. Number 2 is used by the Privy Council Office. Number 3 has been owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin since January 2019.\n\n\n"}

Da Vinci is based on the real-life experiences of Larry Campbell, the former chief coroner of Vancouver who was elected that city's mayor in 2002.\n\nWith the series regular Ian Tracey (playing Mick Leary) inheriting the coroner's job, the show toggles back and forth between crime scenes and politics. Haddock says: \"My approach was to make all the political stuff criminal and all the criminal stuff political. When we're in city hall we're really about conspiracy and scheming, who's crooked and who's going to get caught.\"\n\n\nWith an average weekly audience of just 400,000 viewers, \"Da Vinci's City Hall\" lost about half of the former audience for \"Da Vinci's Inquest\". On February 13, 2006, the CBC announced that the show would not be brought back for a second season in 2006, although they also indicated that negotiations were underway to reprise the Da Vinci character in a series of television movies, similar to the manner in which \"North of 60\" continued after its run as a weekly series had ended. The first of those TV movies, \"The Quality of Life\", aired on CBC on June 14, 2008.\n\nThe show's final episode was aired on February 28, 2006. The program was repeated on the Canadian channel Showcase during the summer of 2008.\n\nCBC management has been criticized for cancelling the show to make room for other series that have since proved less successful.\n\nBeginning April 27, 2007, Superstation WGN began airing \"Da Vinci's City Hall\", but it is promoted by American syndicator Program Partners as \"Season 8\" of \"Da Vinci's Inquest\", even using the same intro as that series (which was used only late into the show's original run) despite the fact that some of the characters seen are not present in the new series.\n\nNationwide syndication to local stations began in November 2007, also as part of the \"Da Vinci's Inquest\" package, with that show's titles.\n\n"}

It is the cathedral church of the Episcopal Diocese of California.\n\nThe cathedral is famed for its mosaics by Jan Henryk De Rosen, a replica of Ghiberti's \"Gates of Paradise\", two labyrinths, varied stained glass windows, Keith Haring AIDS Chapel altarpiece, and medieval and contemporary furnishings, as well as its forty-four bell carillon, three organs, and choirs.\n\nThe cathedral has one of only a handful of remaining Episcopal men and boys cathedral choirs, the Grace Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys; the 24 boys of the choir attend the Cathedral School for Boys, while the 12 men are a professional ensemble. There is also a mixed-voice adult choir. The director of music and choirmaster is Ben Bachmann.\n\nAlan Jones retired as dean in 2009. He was also the moderator of The Forum at Grace Cathedral. In 2010 Jane Shaw was installed as the eighth dean of Grace Cathedral. She left Grace Cathedral in September 2014 to become Dean for Religious Life and Professor of Religious Studies at Stanford University. In 2015 Malcolm Clemens Young became the ninth Dean of Grace Cathedral.\n\nThe cathedral's ancestral parish, Grace Church, was founded in 1849 during the California Gold Rush; the Little Grace Chapel was built on Powell near Jackson across the street from the first Episcopal Church in San Francisco, Trinity Church. After Trinity moved away, Grace Church moved into the larger building; an imposing third church, for a time called Grace \"Cathedral\", was built at California and Stockton starting in 1862. The new church was consecrated on May 3, 1868. Prominent members of San Francisco society joined the parish in the third church, including Leland Stanford and William Henry Crocker.\n\nIn 1865, Mark Twain published (in \"The Californian\" newspaper) purported private correspondence between himself and potential short-term rectors, satirizing the church's efforts to find a short-term rector in the 1860s and 1870s. Among the short-term rectors were roll film inventor Hannibal Goodwin and James Smith Bush, the great-grandfather of former US President George H. W. Bush and great-great-grandfather of former US President George W. Bush.\n\nThe 1862 building was destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake. The family of railroad baron and banker William Henry Crocker donated the site of their ruined Nob Hill property (on the block bounded by California, Jones, Sacramento, and Taylor) for a diocesan cathedral, which took its name and founding congregation from the nearby parish.\n\nDean J. Wilmer Gresham nurtured the young cathedral and work began on the present structure with the laying of the cornerstone in 1910. Designed in French Gothic style by Lewis P. Hobart, it was completed in 1964 as the third largest Episcopal cathedral in the nation.\n\nOn March 28, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a sermon at Grace Cathedral as part of the festival celebrating its completion and consecration. The service took place on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Approximately 5,000 people were present to hear King's sermon. It was the largest gathering at the cathedral for the next 37 years, until the September 11, 2001, memorial service took place.\n\nThe initial plans were drawn up by George Bodley and redesigned by his partner Cecil Hare after Bodley's death; Hobart, acting as Hare's local agent, completed the design. The cathedral was built using ferroconcrete over four campaigns, lasting from 1928–30, 1931–34, 1939–43, and 1961–64. From 1914 to 1930, the congregation met in the present basement of the nave, now named the Founders Crypt. Services moved to the present Chapel of Grace in 1930, and by 1934, work on the Cathedral had been sufficiently completed to allow services to move there. Further work on the building was suspended by the Great Depression; the north tower was completed in 1943, followed by a long suspension in construction until 1960, when work on the final tower was started. The completion of the final tower in 1964 marked the end of structural construction, although much of the interior finish remains incomplete.\n\nThe overall plan and exterior of the French Gothic cathedral is inspired by cathedrals at Amiens, Paris, Beauvais, and Chartres. The interior features are inspired by the Aragon Palma Cathedral, and the Chapel of Grace is drawn from the Sainte-Chapelle. Overall, Grace Cathedral is long, wide at the transepts, with a central spire (\"flèche\") rising above street level. The towers are above street level. The entry floor of the cathedral is itself above street level, and the sanctuary floor is above sea level. Under the original Bodley plans, Grace Cathedral would have been smaller and more square, long and wide.\n\nGrace Cathedral has a significant collection of varied works by Jan Henryk De Rosen. Among these are a faux-tile mural behind the Chapel of Grace reredos from 1932, the mural in the Chapel of the Nativity's Adoration from 1946 showing the Holy Family with the magi and shepherds. At the donor's request, the original angels hovering above were removed by the artist, however constellations still mark their place. De Rosen also included a little image of his boyhood home in Warsaw in the mural. On a smaller scale, De Rosen painted exquisite panels for the original old high altar which is now in the Chapel of St. Francis columbarium.\n\nThe most visible works of De Rosen in Grace Cathedral are the historical aisle murals that were painted in 1949 and 1950 and composed in a style blending elements of the early Italian masters Giotto and Mantegna.\n\nThe cathedral entrance has a large pair of doors, often called the \"Ghiberti doors\". They are reproductions of the doors of the Florence Baptistery by Lorenzo Ghiberti, also dubbed the \"Gates of Paradise\".\nIn 1943, the Nazi occupation government ordered the original doors to be removed from the Florence baptistery, along with other portable artworks, to protect them from bombing and possibly to give Hermann Göring a chance to add them to his collection. They were hidden in a disused railway tunnel until 1944, and latex casts were made after their rediscovery. The replica doors were cast in 1956 from molds of the original doors and were destined for a war memorial, but when financing for the memorial fell through, San Francisco philanthropist Charles D. Field bought these replicas, and they were then shipped to San Francisco and installed on the newly completed church in time for its official dedication in 1964.\n\nThe original Ghiberti doors are no longer installed in the baptistery as corrosion and weathering led conservators to decide that they must be preserved in a museum under a totally dry and controlled atmosphere. The doors now in the baptistery are more modern replicas installed in 1991.\n\nLaid out on the floor of Grace Cathedral is a labyrinth that is based on the famous medieval labyrinth of \"Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres\" (The Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres) located in Chartres, France. It is said that if a visitor walks the pattern of the labyrinth it will bring them to a meditative state. There is also another labyrinth outside of the cathedral in its courtyards.\n\nContained in the cathedral are of stained glass windows by noted artists that depict over 1100 figures ranging from Adam and Eve to Albert Einstein. 32 windows or window groups, dating from 1930 to 1966, were designed by American Charles Connick and his Boston studio. Connick windows include the Chapel of Grace and baptistry window series that contains over 32,000 pieces of glass and covers nearly . The cathedral also contains 24 faceted windows by Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France, including the Human Endeavor series depicting John Glenn, Thurgood Marshall, Jane Addams, Robert Frost, and Einstein. Between 1995 and 1998, several of the cathedral's choir and aisle windows were restored by Reflection Studios of Emeryville, California.\n\nThe carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco dentist and realtor who came from Lostwithiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, he found his way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide bells for the church and eventually spent his life savings to realize his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower to house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and tuned at the Gillett & Johnston Foundry of Croydon, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before the cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from its Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been rung to mark a number of important events, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system.\n\nPhotographer Ansel Adams produced a series of photographs of the incomplete cathedral in 1935.\n\n\"Grace Cathedral Park\" is the first song on Red House Painters' first self-titled album.\n\n\"Grace Cathedral Hill\" is Track 7 on The Decemberists' \"Castaways and Cutouts\" album. It recounts a New Year's Eve experience in which the singer and his sullen (presumably grieving) female companion visit the church to light candles.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock filmed an abduction scene for his final film, \"Family Plot\", in the cathedral in 1975. It also appeared in \"The Pleasure of His Company\" (1961), \"Bullitt\" (1968), \"Time After Time\" (1979), \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999), and \"\"The Room\"\" (2003).\n\nJazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed and recorded a mass for jazz trio and choir. The performance at the cathedral on May 21, 1965 was released as \"At Grace Cathedral\".\n\nDuke Ellington performed his televised Concert of Sacred Music at the cathedral on September 26, 1965.\n\nBay Area local resident, Greg Kihn and the Greg Kihn Band, a popular rock group of the 1980s, filmed some of their MTV \"Jeopardy\" video inside Grace Cathedral in 1983.\n\nArmistead Maupin's iconic \"Tales of the City\" series has an Episcopal cannibal cult operating out of Grace Cathedral as one of its sub-plots. In the TV adaptation, Maupin plays a cameo role as a priest of Grace Cathedral, but the cathedral interiors were actually filmed in Montreal.\n\nFort Point Beer Company's beer can for their KSA beer features a graphic illustration of the Grace Cathedral.\n\n Grace Cathedral has had nine deans.\n\n\n\nPanorama\n"}

Each contour line can be defined as a closed line joining relief points at equal height above sea level. It is usually drawn on the same horizontal scale as the map, but the use of an exaggerated vertical scale is advisable to underline the elements of the relief. This can vary according to the slope and amplitude of the terrestrial relief, but is usually three to five times the horizontal scale.\n\nA series of parallel profiles, taken at regular intervals on a map, can be combined to provide a more complete three-dimensional view of the area that appears on the topographic map. It is evident that, thanks to computer science, more sophisticated three-dimensional models of the landscape can be made from digital terrain data.\n\nThe line of the plane defined by the points that limit the profile is called the guideline and the horizontal line of comparison on which the profile is constructed is called base.\n\nOne of the most important applications of the topographic profiles is in the construction of works of great length and small width, for example roads, sewers or pipelines.\n\nSometimes topographical profiles appear in printed maps, such as those designed for navigation routes, excavations and especially for geological maps, where they are used to show the internal structure of the rocks that populate a territory.\n\nPeople who study natural resources such as geologists, geomorphologists, soil scientists and vegetation scholars, among others, build profiles to observe the relationship of natural resources to changes in topography and analyze numerous problems.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2017757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017757", "title": "Aseptic meningitis", "text": "Aseptic meningitis\n\nAseptic meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges, a membrane covering the brain and spinal cord in patients whose cerebral spinal fluid test result is negative with routine bacterial cultures. Aseptic meningitis is caused by viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, fungi, medications, and cancer malignancies. The testing for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis is mostly the same. A cerebrospinal fluid sample is taken by lumbar puncture and is tested for leukocyte levels to determine if there is an infection and goes on to further testing to see what the actual cause is. The symptoms are the same for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis but the severity of the symptoms and the treatment can depend on the certain cause.\n\nThe most common cause of aseptic meningitis is by viral infection. Other causes may include side-effects from drugs and connective tissue disorders.\n\nAseptic meningitis is a disease that can depend on the patient’s age, however research has shown some distinct symptoms that indicate the possibility of aseptic meningitis. A variety of patients notice a change in body temperatures (higher than normal temperatures 38-40°C), marked with the possibility of vomiting, headaches, firm neck pain, and even lack of appetite. In younger patients, like babies, a meningeal inflammation can be noticed along with the possibility of hepatic necrosis and myocarditis. In serious cases, a multiple organ failure can also signal aseptic meningitis and oftentimes, in babies, seizures and focal neurological deficits can be early symptoms of aseptic meningitis. In fact, in newborns, the mortality rate is 70%. The next set of age group, like children, have similar but varying symptoms of sore throat, rashes, and diarrhea. In adults, symptoms and the harshness of them tend to be less in duration. Additionally, the probability of developing aseptic meningitis increases when patients have a case of mumps or herpes.\n\nSymptoms of meningitis caused by an acute viral infection last between one and two weeks. When aseptic meningitis is caused by cytomegalovirus 20 percent of individuals face mortality or morbidity. If left untreated it can affect an individuals hearing and learning abilities.\n\nThe most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection, specifically by enteroviruses. In fact, 90 percent of all meningitis cases that are viral are caused by enteroviruses. Other viruses that may cause aseptic meningitis are varicella zoster virus, herpes, and mumps. Other causes may include mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes, and complications from HIV. Side effects of certain drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin), and antiepileptic drugs can also cause aseptic meningitis.\n\nThere are multiple types of aseptic meningitis which are differentiated based on its cause.\n\n\nThe term \"aseptic\" can be misleading, implying a lack of infection. On the contrary, many cases of aseptic meningitis represent infection with viruses or mycobacteria that cannot be detected with routine methods. Medical professionals will take into consideration the season of the year, the medical history of the individual and family, physical examination, and laboratory results when diagnosing aseptic meningitis.\n\nOne common medical test used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis is lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid collected from the lumbar puncture is analyzed by microscope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Gram stains, and viral cultures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection. Other laboratory tests include blood, urine, and stool collection. Medical professionals also have the option of performing a computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tests help observe calcifications or abscesses.\n\nIf CSF levels are irregular among individuals, they will undergo hospitalization where they receive antiviral therapy. If aseptic meningitis was caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), the individual will receive acyclovir, an antiviral drug. If infants are diagnosed, medical professionals will order regular check-ins for hearing and learning disabilities.\n\nAseptic meningitis was first described by Wallgren in 1925. Aseptic meningitis cases have varied historically. Aseptic meningitis caused by mumps has declined in the United States due to the increased use of vaccination which prevents mumps cases from occurring.\n\n"}

Such elimination of other reasonable possibilities is a major component in performing a differential diagnosis.\n\nThe largest category of diagnosis by exclusion is seen among psychiatric disorders where the presence of physical or organic disease must be excluded as a prerequisite for making a functional diagnosis. Diagnosis by exclusion tends to occur where scientific knowledge is scarce, specifically where the means to verify a diagnosis by an objective method is absent. As a specific diagnosis cannot be confirmed, a fall back position is to exclude that group of known causes that may cause a similar clinical presentation.\n\nAn example of such a diagnosis is \"fever of unknown origin\": to explain the cause of elevated temperature the most common causes of unexplained fever (infection, neoplasm, or collagen vascular disease) must be ruled out.\n\nOther examples include:\n\n"}

When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the plaintiff's negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages. It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.\n\nPrior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called \"pure\" comparative negligence. A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.)\n\nThe second and third versions are lumped together in what is called \"modified\" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover \"only\" if the plaintiff's negligence is \"not greater than\" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties).\n\nThe other variant allows plaintiffs to recover \"only if\" the plaintiff's negligence is \"not as great as\" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.\n\nSome states, though, still use the contributory negligence doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia continue to use contributory negligence.\n\nNeither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with joint and several liability, which generally holds each of two or more culpable defendants responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.\n\n"}

(abbreviated post-nominally as \"S.S.J.\") are a society of Catholic priests and brothers, based in the United States and ministering specifically to African-Americans.\n\nIt is a Roman Catholic Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right for men, formed in 1871 by a group of priests from the English Foreign Mission Society of Saint Joseph, also known as the Mill Hill Missionaries. They decided to establish a mission society in the United States dedicated to the cause and needs of newly freed people emancipated during the American Civil War.\n\n1865 ushered in the period of Southern Reconstruction, during which time, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, outlawing slavery, was passed. Ten former Confederate states were divided into five military districts. As a condition of readmission to the Union, the former Confederate states were required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which granted citizenship to all people born in the U.S. regardless of race.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the U.S. bishops met for their tenth provincial council in Baltimore, Maryland in 1869. The fifth decree of this Council exhorted the Council Fathers to provide missions and schools for all black Americans in their dioceses, as education was seen as a critical need by the community.\n\nSubsequently, the Council Fathers wrote a letter requesting clergy for that purpose to Father Herbert Vaughan, superior general of the Saint Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions in Mill Hill, London. He had founded the society in 1866, and in 1869 opened St Joseph's Foreign Missionary College in that area of London. Later Vaughan was installed as Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster.\n\nVaughan brought a group of priests to Baltimore in 1871 to form a mission society devoted to freedmen. In 1893 they re-organized to create a United States-based institution, the St. Joseph Society of the Sacred Heart.\n\nAmong the small founding group of Josephite priests in 1893 was Fr. Charles R. Uncles, the first African-American priest, who was both trained and ordained in the United States, with his initial studies at a seminary in Quebec, Canada. The commitment to the African-American apostolate by the new Society was the same as before; to teach the faith of the Catholic Church and to promote the Church’s teachings on social justice. The society is interracial, with resources and personnel being committed totally to serving the African-American community. It was founded in 1893 by Fr. John Slattery, as a North American offshoot of the Saint Joseph's Missionary Society of Mill Hill.\n\nThe society operates St. Augustine High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, a historically black high school, established by the Archdiocese of New Orleans in 1951.\n\nThe Josephite Fathers also operate St. Joseph Manor in Baltimore and St. Joseph Seminary in Washington, DC.\n\nIn June 2011, the Josephite Fathers and Brothers, 140 years after their founding in 1871 to serve the African-American community, elected their first black superior general: the Right Reverend Father William Norvel, Previously pastor of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in Washington, D.C.. Father Norvel then served a four-year term at the religious institute's Baltimore headquarters.\n\nFather Norvel had served as consultor general for the Josephites from 1983-1987, and as President of the National Black Clergy Caucus from 1985-1987. He is credited with starting the Gospel choir movement in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. He also established a Josephite house of spiritual formation in Nigeria, where he served for five years. The house has been the source of a number of Josephite vocations.\n\n\"The Josephite Harvest\" is the official magazine of the Society of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart, which has been ministering in the African-American community since 1871. \"The Harvest\" has been in publication for 125 years, which makes it the longest running Catholic mission magazine still in existence in the US today. It first began in 1888 published under the name \"The Colored Harvest\", before being changed in 1960 to \"The Josephite Harvest\". During the 20th century, \"The Harvest\" chronicled the Josephites' efforts to build parishes and schools for African-Americans throughout the nation.\n\nIn 2012, it counted 40 houses and 88 members, including 76 priests.\n\n\"(incomplete?)\n\n\n\n\n"}

CFRP is the largest research park in Florida, the fourth largest in the United States by number of companies, and the seventh largest in the United States by number of employees. CFRP is home to numerous centers hosted by the United States Department of Defense, UCF, and private corporations.\n\nThe Park was established as a result of legislation passed by the Florida Legislature in 1978, and is a cooperative effort between the University of Central Florida, the Orange County Research and Development Authority, and the Orange County Board of County Commissioners. The governing body of the Park is the Orange County Research and Development Authority. The university and officials of CFRP believe that the potential for the establishment of close ties between the university and industry will create an attractive environment conducive to the location of research-oriented industry in the Park. This activity will enrich and support the academic, teaching, and research programs of the university. Businesses can purchase or lease land in the park on which to construct a facility or can lease space for office, lab, or light manufacturing activities.\n\nPlanned to provide a campus-like environment for business adjacent to UCF, the CFRP covers over , directly south of UCF's main campus in Orlando. Located approximately northeast of downtown Orlando and southwest of Daytona Beach, the park was built to supplement the university's goal of providing highly trained personnel to support the Kennedy Space Center and NASA, which is located only to the east.\n\nSignificant organizations, including the Institute for Simulation and Training, National Center for Simulation, Team Orlando, and the National Center for Forensic Science, are located in the Research Park. \n\nGiven the importance of simulation and training to the Department of Defense, an extensive military presence is also located in the park centered on the Orlando area's last remaining active duty military installation, Naval Support Activity Orlando. Tenant commands at NSA Orlando include the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), the US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Research, Development and Engineering Command United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC), Marine Corps Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS), and the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS).

The Dowling Forest Racecourse in Ballarat was the location for the first VATC race meeting on Friday, 24 March 1876. Within six months the VATC were granted use of Crown land at Caulfield as a permanent home in Melbourne.\nIn 1879, the club staged the first running of the Caulfield Cup, and two years later, introduced the Caulfield Guineas and the Toorak Handicap. In addition the Caulfield Cup was switched to the spring racing season and became the lead up race to the Melbourne Cup. The Futurity Stakes was added to the racing calendar in 1898. The Club suffered the loss of the Members' Stand in 1922 when it was destroyed by fire, and five years later the Guineas Stand was also burnt down.\n\nThe military occupied Caulfield Racecourse in 1940 for a period of four years when it became a depot and barracks for army recruits during the Second World War.

{"id": "2017814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017814", "title": "Xi Jinping", "text": "Xi Jinping\n\nXi Jinping (; ; ; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician who has served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) since 2012, and President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. Xi has been the paramount leader, the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012, and he officially received the title of \"leadership core\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th CPC Politburo Standing Committee since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, he was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father's purge during the Cultural Revolution, and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at the Tsinghua University as a \"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was Governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming Governor and Party Secretary of neighbouring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the Party Secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee and Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008 he was designated as Hu Jintao's presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed Vice President of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n\nXi is the first General Secretary born after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted a more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China–Japan relations, China's claims in the South China Sea, and its advocacy for free trade and globalization. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nAs the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the People's Republic, Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed National Security Commission, as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the internet. Xi's political thoughts have been written into the party and state constitutions, and a cult of personality has developed around him. Xi has been labelled a \"dictator\" by some political observers, citing an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights and the removal of term limits for the Presidency under his tenure. \n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953, the second son of Xi Zhongxun and his wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 by Mao Zedong, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress. Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao (), born in 1949 and An'an (), born in 1952. Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.\n\nXi went to the Beijing 101 Middle School in the 1960s. There, he developed a close friendship with Liu He, who later became China's vice-premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader. In 1963, when he was age 10, his father was purged from the Party and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan. In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, was killed. Later, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later thrown into prison in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi Town, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave. After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches.\n\nAfter being rejected seven times, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 by befriending a local official. He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by Premier Zhou Enlai. From 1973, he applied to join the Communist Party of China ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Beijing's Tsinghua University as a \"Worker-Peasant-Soldier student\". The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong thought and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the Central Military Commission. This gained Xi some military background. In 1985, as part of a Chinese delegation to study U.S. agriculture, he stayed in the home of an American family in the town of Muscatine, Iowa. This trip, and his two-week stay with a U.S. family, is said to have had a lasting impression upon him and his views on the United States.\n\nIn 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county. Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007). Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University, graduating from there with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002. In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, then he became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy. In February 2000, he and then-provincial Party Secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of the Party Central Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China – General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji, Vice-President Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection Secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee Secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year. His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007 where he was the party secretary there for seven months. In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation which stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\". While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal. On most issues Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.\n\nXi was appointed to the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice-president of the People's Republic of China. Following his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.\n\nXi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the Politburo Standing Committee at the 18th Party Congress, with the possibility of creating a counterweight to Xi, or even replacing him. Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Xi's position as successor was secured with Bo's downfall due to the Wang Lijun incident.\n\nXi is considered one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\". Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\". Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".\n\nIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil to promote Chinese ties in the region and boost the country's reputation in the wake of the global financial crisis. He also visited Valletta, Malta, before returning to China.\n\nOn 11 February, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions to the financial crisis, saying that it was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3 billion people from hunger\". He went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?\" The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi's remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.\n\nIn the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009. He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009. He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House and then Vice President Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family which previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.\n\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012. On 4 September, he cancelled a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and later also cancelled meetings with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a top Russian official. It was said that Xi effectively \"went on strike\" in preparation for the power transition in order to install political allies in key roles. \"The Washington Post\" reported from a single source that Xi may have been injured in an altercation during a meeting of the \"red second generation\" which turned violent.\n\nOn 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the Communist Party and chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission by the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the Politburo Standing Committee onto the stage in their first public appearance. The new Standing Committee reduced its number of seats from nine to seven, with only Xi himself and Li Keqiang retaining their seats from the previous Standing Committee; the remaining members were new. In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention of his predecessors. Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the Party's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.\n\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors. Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.\n\nXi was elected President of the People's Republic of China on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions. He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms. In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War. On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung. Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.\n\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang. A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another ad-hoc policy coordination body led by Xi—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda. Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 \"Southern Tour\". In the economic realm, the plenum announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources. This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure state-owned enterprises to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets which were no longer being used productively. The plenum also resolved to abolish the \"laogai\" system of \"re-education through labour\" which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers. The one-child policy was also abolished, resulting in a shift to a two-child policy from 1 January 2016.\n\nXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party. A few months into his term, Xi outlined the \"eight-point guide\", listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.\n\nDuring the first two years of Xi's term, he initiated cases against former Central Military Commission vice-chairman Xu Caihou, former Politburo Standing Committee member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua. Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi's administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.\n\nThe campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Xi's anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics as a political purge on a scale not seen since Chairman Mao, with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power. Xi's establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, that is ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" which \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law\".\n\n\"Document No. 9\" is a confidential internal document widely circulated within the Communist Party of China in 2013 by the party's General Office. It was first published in July 2012. The document warns of seven dangerous Western values: constitutional democracy, universal values, civil society, pro-market neo-liberalism, media independence, historical nihilism (criticisms of past errors) and questioning the nature of Chinese style socialism. Coverage of these topics in educational materials is forbidden. The specific ideas posed as dangerous within the tenets of Western Constitutional Democracy included the separation of powers, multi-party systems, general elections, and an independent judiciary. The threat from 'universal values' is the notion, contrary to Maoist doctrine, that the Western value system transcends nation in class, and applies to China. 'Civil society' is the notion that individual rights are paramount, rather than the collective rights established by the Party. Neoliberalism refers to libertarian economic values and globalization. Xi was especially hostile to Western ideas of journalism, and notions of a press that could criticize government and Party policies. The release of this internal document, which has introduced new topics that were previously not \"off-limits\", was seen as Xi's recognition of the \"sacrosanct\" nature of Communist Party rule over China. \nSince Xi became the General Secretary of the CPC, censorship has been significantly stepped up. Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy\". His administration has also overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations. The situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest. A law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\". The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the Communist Party, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.\n\nIn July 2017, the character Winnie the Pooh was blocked on Chinese social media sites following the spread of an internet meme in which photographs of Xi and other individuals were compared to Winnie the Pooh and other characters from the works of A. A. Milne and in 2018, the Winnie the Pooh film \"Christopher Robin\" was denied a Chinese release. This followed an incident where Chinese authorities censored a nine-year-old for comments about Xi's weight.\n\nXi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook, advocating Internet censorship in China as the concept of \"internet sovereignty\". The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; as of April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia have been blocked in China.\n\nIn 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.\n\nPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Chairman Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018. Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration. Beginning in 2013, the party under Xi has created a series of new \"Central Leading Groups\"; supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier. Xi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China, another body chaired by Xi which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.\n\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule. Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CPC, he has been referred to as \"Xi Dada\" (Uncle or Papa Xi). The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with Communist propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.\n\nThe party's Politburo named Xi Jinping \"lingxiu\" (), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng. He is also sometimes called the \"Great Helmsman\" (), and in July 2018 Li Zhanshu, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, referred to Xi as the \"eternal core\" of the party. On 25 December 2019, the politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (), a title only Mao held previously.\n\nIn March 2018, the party-controlled National People's Congress passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the Communist Party. On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president. The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the state military commission. Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.\n\nAccording to the \"Financial Times\", Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.\n\nXi has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while also supporting the country's private sector. He has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council. His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased country's currency renminbi's global role, helping it to join IMF's basked of special drawing right. In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\". Since the outbreak of the China-United States trade war in 2018, Xi has also revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology.\n\nThe party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution. It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.\n\nXi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC's highest internal control institution. He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalised CCDI's independence from the day-to-day operations of the CPC, improving its ability to function as a \"bona fide\" control body.\n\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has started a massive overhaul of the People's Liberation Army. Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military, aiming to build a more effective fighting force. In addition, Xi held the \"New Gutian Conference\" in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.\n\nXi has warned against the depoliticization of the PLA from the Communist Party, warning that it would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union. He said that \"in the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\"\n\nXi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA's modernization. On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five. He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the Central Military Commission. Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force and the Joint Logistics Support Force.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country's new Joint Operations Command Center of the People's Liberation Army by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television. Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\". According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi \"not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally\". According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".\n\nA Chinese nationalist, Xi has reportedly taken a hard-line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage. His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.\n\nUnder Xi, China has also taken a more critical stance on North Korea, while improving relationships with South Korea. China–Japan relations have soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.\n\nXi has called China–United States relations in the contemporary world a \"new type of great-power relations\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace. Under his administration the Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued. On China–U.S. relations, Xi said, \"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\". The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.\n\nXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests. Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.\nXi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \"strategic pivot\" to Asia. Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", he told the conference. In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea. In May 2015, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter warned the government of Xi Jinping to halt its rapid island-building in disputed territory in the South China Sea.\nIn spite of what seemed to be a tumultuous start to Xi Jinping's leadership vis-à-vis the United-States, on 13 May 2017 Xi said at the \"Belt and Road Forum\" in Beijing: \"We should foster a new type of international relations featuring 'win-win cooperation', and we should forge a partnership of dialogue with no confrontation, and a partnership of friendship rather than alliance. All countries should respect each other's sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity; respect each other's development path and its social systems, and respect each other's core interests and major concerns... What we hope to create is a big family of harmonious coexistence.”Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the THAAD purchase of the latter while China's relations with North Korea increased because of meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \"timely easing\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.\n\nRelations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2016. Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.\n\nOn 4 June 2019, Xi told the Russian news agency TASS that he was \"worried\" about the current tensions between the U.S. and Iran. He later told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani during an SCO meeting that China would promote ties with Iran regardless of developments from the Gulf of Oman incident.\n\nXi made his first foreign trip as China's paramount leader to Russia on 22 March 2013, about a week after he assumed the presidency. He met with President Vladimir Putin and the two leaders discussed trade and energy issues. He then went on to Tanzania, South Africa (where he attended the BRICS summit in Durban), and the Republic of the Congo. Xi visited the United States at Sunnylands Estate in California in a 'shirtsleeves summit' with U.S. President Barack Obama in June 2013, although this was not considered a formal state visit. In October 2013 Xi attended the APEC Summit in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nIn March 2014 Xi made a trip to Western Europe visiting the Netherlands, where he attended the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, followed by visits to France, Germany and Belgium. He made a state visit to South Korea on 4 July 2014 and met with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Between 14 and 23 July, Xi attended the BRICS leaders' summit in Brazil and visited Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba.\nXi went on an official state visit to India and met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2014; he visited New Delhi and also went to Modi's hometown in the state of Gujarat. He went on a state visit to Australia and met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in November 2014, followed by a visit to the island nation of Fiji. Xi visited Pakistan in April 2015, signing a series of infrastructure deals worth $45 billion related to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. During his visit, Pakistan's highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Pakistan, was conferred upon him. He then headed to Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia, to attend the Afro-Asian Leaders Summit and the 60th Anniversary events of the Bandung Conference. Xi visited Russia and was the guest-of-honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade to mark the 70th Anniversary of the victory of the allies in Europe. At the parade, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan sat next to Putin. On the same trip Xi also visited Kazakhstan and met with that country's president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and also met Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus.\n\nIn September 2015, Xi made his first state visit to the United States. In October 2015, he made a state visit to the United Kingdom, the first by a Chinese leader in a decade. This followed a visit to China in March 2015 by the Duke of Cambridge. During the state visit, Xi met Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister David Cameron and other dignitaries. Increased customs, trade and research collaborations between China and the UK were discussed, but more informal events also took place including a visit to Manchester City's football academy.\n\nIn March 2016, Xi visited the Czech Republic on his way to United States. In Prague, he met with the Czech president, prime minister and other representatives to promote relations and economic cooperation between the Czech Republic and the People's Republic of China. His visit was met by a considerable number of protests by Czechs.\n\nIn January 2017, Xi became the first Chinese paramount leader to plan to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos. On 17 January, Xi addressed the forum in a high-profile keynote, addressing globalization, the global trade agenda, and China's rising place in the world's economy and international governance; he made a series of pledges about China's defense of \"economic globalization\" and climate change accords. Premier Li Keqiang attended the forum in 2015 and Vice-President Li Yuanchao did so in 2016. During the three-day state visit to the country in 2017 Xi also visited the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nIn 20 June 2019, Xi Jinping visited Pyongyang, becoming the first Chinese leader to visit North Korea since his predecessor Hu Jintao's visit in 2004. In 27 June, he attended the G20 summit in Osaka, becoming the first Chinese leader to visit Japan since 2010.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia, and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a \"golden opportunity\". BRI has been called Xi's \"signature project\", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. BRI was added to the constitution of the CPC at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress in 24 October 2017, further elevating its importance.\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has \"started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" since he became leader in 2012. The HRW also said that repression in China is \"at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.\" Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained. He presided over the 709 crackdown in 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained. His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.\n\nIn 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country. According to local social media, officials \"transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party\". According to activists, \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982\", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".\n\nFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, Xi launched the \"people's war on terror\" in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there. Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between April 27 and April 30 in 2014. As of 2019, China is holding one million ethnic Uyghurs in internment camps in Xinjiang. Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as “concentration camps”, where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society. Internal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show “absolutely no mercy” and that officials use all the “weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship” to suppress those “infected with the virus of extremism”. The documents also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" which could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.” However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China completely, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".\n\nOn 8 July 2019, 22 countries signed a statement to the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights in which they called for an end to mass detentions in China and expressed concerns over widespread surveillance and repression.\n\nIn July 2019, 37 countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Sudan, Angola, Algeria, Nigeria, DR Congo, North Korea, Serbia, Russia, Venezuela, Philippines, Myanmar, Pakistan and Syria signed a joint letter to the UNHRC commending China's \"remarkable achievements in the field of human rights\" under President Xi, claiming \"Now safety and security has returned to Xinjiang and the fundamental human rights of people of all ethnic groups there are safeguarded.\" Ultimately 50 countries and observer states including Iran, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Djibouti and Palestine signed the letter.\n\nGerman newspaper \"Der Spiegel\" reported that Chinese leader Xi Jinping pressured Tedros Adhanom, director of the World Health Organization in January 2020 to hold off on issuing a global warning about the coronavirus outbreak. The report published over the weekend said Xi urged the WHO chief to “delay a global warning” about the pandemic and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, but WHO denied German allegations.\n\nElizabeth C. Economy argued in 2018:\n\nXi and Communist Party ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era. Since 2013, the phrase has emerged as the distinctive quasi-official ideology of the party leadership under Xi, much as the \"Scientific Outlook on Development\" was for Hu Jintao and the \"Three Represents\" was for Jiang Zemin. The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars, some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream. \"The Economist\" noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors. While the Chinese Dream was originally interpreted as an extension of the American Dream, which emphasises individual self-improvement and opportunity, the slogan's use in official settings since 2013 has taken on a noticeably more nationalistic character, with official pronouncements of the \"Dream\" being consistently linked with the phrase \"great revival of the Chinese nation\".\n\nAs communist ideology plays a less central role in the lives of the masses in the People's Republic of China, top political leaders of the Communist Party of China such as Xi continue the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism, both of which Xi sees as relevant. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CPC has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"\n\nHan Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations. One sentence of Han Fei's that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.\n\nXi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking apart from CPC's path which had often attacked it. He has called traditional culture the \"soul\" of the nation and the \"foundation\" of the CPC's culture. Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him.\n\nIn September 2017, the Communist Party Central Committee decided that Xi's political philosophies, generally referred to as \"Xi Jinping Thought\", would become part of the Party Constitution. Xi first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\". On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the Communist Party of China.\n\nXi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the \"primary stage of socialism\". In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi's colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the \"Three Represents\", and the Scientific Development Perspective, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations.The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi's \"The Governance of China\" book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.\n\nAn app for teaching “Xi Jinping Thought” has become the most popular smartphone app in China, as the country's ruling Communist Party launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. \"Xuexi Qiangguo\", which translates to “Study powerful country”, is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok – known as Weixin and Douyin, respectively, in mainland China.\n\nIn Xi's view, the Communist Party is the legitimate, constitutionally-sanctioned ruling party of China, and that the party derives this legitimacy through advancing the Mao-style \"mass line Campaign\"; that is the party represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of ordinary people. In this vein, Xi called for officials to practise mild self-criticism in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.\n\nXi's position has been described as preferring highly centralized political power as a means to direct large-scale economic restructuring. Xi believes that China should be \"following its own path\" and that a strong authoritarian government is an integral part of the \"China model\", operating on a \"core socialist value system\", which has been interpreted as China's alternative to Western values. However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise full and direct political control of all party activities.\n\nXi has supported and pursued a greater economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China through projects such as the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge. He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong. Xi's push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.\n\nXi has supported the Hong Kong Government and incumbent Chief Executive Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. He has defended the Hong Kong police's use of force, saying that \"We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.\" While visiting Macau in 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of \"foreign forces\" interfering in Hong Kong and Macau, while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.\n\nThe 2015 meeting between Xi and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950. Xi said that China and Taiwan are \"one family\" that can't be pulled apart.\n\nIn the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of \"Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification\". According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan. In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the \"punishment of history\" for any attempts at separatism.\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: \"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.\" Those options, he said, could be used against “external interference”. Xi also said that they \"are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" Tsai Ing-Wen responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing for the need of all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.\n\nXi married Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years. The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.\n\nXi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan in 1987. Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques. Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014. Xi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English. Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the Central Military Commission.\n\nIn June 2012, \"Bloomberg News\" reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them. The \"Bloomberg\" website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article. Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, \"The New York Times\" reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.\n\nRelatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui, Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the Communist Party in November 2012.\n\nPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: \"When he comes home, I've never felt as if there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband.\" Xi was described in a 2011 \"The Washington Post\" article by those who know him as \"pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key\". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and \"seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office\". He is known to love U.S. films such as \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"The Departed\" and \"The Godfather\". He is also a fan of HBO television series \"Game of Thrones\", watching a condensed version due to tight schedules. He also praised the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke. He also likes playing soccer, mountain climbing, walking, volleyball and swimming. He once said that he would swim one kilometre and walk every day as long as there was time.\n\nXi Jinping is widely popular in China. According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.

In 1985, Rosario met Karen Walker at a club, while working as a cigarette lady, and went to work for her as a maid, which was where she was working when the series began in 1998. Rosario and Karen are very close, but their relationship is love-hate. They are notorious for swapping insults. Rosario is just as feisty as Karen, and is one of the few people who manage to go head-to-head with her. A native of El Salvador, Rosario was a school teacher who received a bachelor's degree in clinical psychology from the University of Texas and who almost got a master's degree. She also attended business school. At some point, she moved to the Bronx, presumably while studying business; however, Karen makes a comment that she bought Rosario from Rosario's parents. While there, she also performed with a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez, including a production of \"Tea for Two\" at the Shalom Retirement Center. At one point, she was also paid to tape pornographic videos for Tommy Lee. Although she had been mentioned by Karen since the pilot episode, Rosario's first appearance was in the season 1 finale. Due to Karen's patronizing tone, we're made to think that Rosario doesn't speak English well. Rosario actually speaks English fluently, albeit with a thick accent, but is an illegal alien. To keep her in the country, Karen has her marry Jack McFarland, her gay friend, to get a green card. The marriage was later terminated at the end of season 2 when Rosario asked for a divorce in order to pursue other romantic interests. However, she maintained a close relationship with Jack (often echoing hers with Karen) and claimed to still think of him as family. In the series finale, Rosario was shown to have lived with Karen and Jack in the years after the show ended, growing older with them and possibly still working for them despite being in a wheelchair (though she states that she is only in the wheelchair due to a sprained ankle).\n\nIn the series reboot in 2017, Rosario died off-camera in Season 9 Episode 6, \"Rosario's Quinceañera\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

KG is a German shoe manufacturer headquartered in Neustadt (Wied), Germany. The company sells Birkenstocks, a German brand of sandals, and other shoes notable for their contoured cork and rubber footbeds (soles), which conform somewhat to the shape of their wearers' feet.\n\nRepresentative products include the two-strap \"Arizona sandal\" and the \"Boston clog\".\n\nThe Birkenstock brand traces its roots to Johann Adam Birkenstock, registered in 1774 as a \"vassal and shoemaker\" in local church archives in the small Hessian village of Langen-Bergheim. In 1896, Johann's great-great-grandson Konrad Birkenstock developed the first contoured insole for use by shoemakers in the production of custom footwear. Also in the year 1896 Karl opened two shoe stores in Frankfurt, Germany where he continued to make and sell his insoles. 1902 saw the development of the first flexible arch-support for insertion into factory-made shoes; and in 1964, Karl Birkenstock developed these inserts into a shoe — thus producing the original prototype of the Birkenstock sandal. In 1925 Konrad Birkenstock expanded the company by buying a large factory in Friedberg, Hesse. After World War II (1939–1945) the Birkenstock sandal was popular among returning soldiers because of the orthopedic support. Starting in 1963 and continuing into 1964 Karl Birkenstock released his first athletic sandal with a flexible footbed called Madrid. It soon became popular, especially among gymnasts.\n\nIn 1966, Birkenstocks were introduced in the United States, as well as elsewhere. The American Margot Fraser \"discovered\" Birkenstock sandals while visiting a spa in Germany. She gained relief from a foot condition, and founded a trading company called Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, Inc., in Novato, California, based on her enthusiasm for the sandals. Renamed Birkenstock Distribution USA, Inc., in 2005, the company remained until 2007 the exclusive importer and distributor of Birkenstock name-brand products in the United States. In 2007 the owners of Birkenstock Orthopädie GmbH & Co. KG purchased their long-standing distribution partner Birkenstock Distribution USA, Inc. (BDUSA).\n\nWhen Margot Fraser first started distributing them in San Francisco, California, she was unsuccessful. Later on in the 1970s a cultural revolution improved her business. In the United States, Birkenstock first became popular among young men and later on among flower children, a group traditionally associated with American liberalism. The shoe became popular with hippies and others who had a \"back to nature\" philosophy and appreciated the natural foot shape and foot-friendly comfort of Birkenstocks. \n\nNordstrom became the first department store to sell Birkenstock sandals in 1986. Prior to that, health food stores were Birkenstock's primary outlet.\n\nIn the early 1990s \"Birks\" enjoyed a surge of popularity among high-school and college-aged Generation Xers comparable to the 2000s popularity of Rainbow Sandals and Crocs, followed by another comeback among teens and young adults in the early 2010s. During the 2004 U.S. presidential primary, some conservatives derided Howard Dean's supporters as \"Birkenstock liberals\".\n\nIn 2018, the company was given PETA's Libby Award for being the \"Most Animal-Friendly Shoe Company.\"\n\nThe footbed of the Birkenstock shoe was created in the 1930s and possesses four different layers that complete the shoes. The first layer of the shoe is the shock absorbent sole, followed by a layer of jute fibers, a firm corked footbed and another layer of jute. The last layer is the footbed line which is a soft suede.\n"}

At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks, only wide, and tumbles , before flowing westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000 ft³/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than wide.\n\nSamuel Baker and Florence Baker were the first Europeans who sighted them. Baker named them after Roderick Murchison, the President of the Royal Geographical Society. The falls lend their name to the surrounding Murchison Falls National Park.\n\nDuring the regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, the name was changed to Kabalega Falls, after the Omukama (King) Kabalega of Bunyoro, although this was never legally promulgated. The name reverted to Murchison Falls following the downfall of Idi Amin. It is still sometimes referred to as Kabalega Falls.\n\nErnest Hemingway crashed a plane just downriver from Murchison Falls in 1954. In August 2019, Uganda rejected a hydropower project by South Africa’s Bonang Power and Energy. The reason was that Murchison Falls is one of the country's lucrative tourism sites.\n\n\n"}

He came from a musical family. His grandfather Budd Johnson was a saxophonist, and his grand-uncle, Keg Johnson, was a trombonist. Both of them are remembered for their contributions to the bebop era of jazz. His mother, Fatima Frances (Collins) Johnson, was a member of The Crystals. His father, Budd Johnson Jr., was a member of a doo-wop music group called The Chanters. His great-great-great-grandfather, William Jefferson White, founded Georgia's Morehouse College.\n\nProdigy grew up in LeFrak. While attending the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, he met his future music partner, Havoc. The duo became the \"Poetical Prophets\", before choosing the name \"The Infamous Mobb Deep\". Under the alias Lord-T (The Golden Child), the then 16-year-old Johnson joined Jive Records and landed an uncredited guest appearance on the \"Boyz n the Hood\" soundtrack, for his collaborative efforts on the song \"Too Young\" by Hi-Five in 1991.\n\nInitially compared to fellow rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his \"Illmatic\" album from 1994, Mobb Deep released \"The Infamous\" in 1995, which was certified Gold by the RIAA within the first two months of its release. 1995 was also the year that Prodigy began to raise his solo profile, by providing a guest appearance on LL Cool J's controversial I Shot Ya (remix). The song became a minor part of the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, due to Tupac Shakur believing the song to be a diss referring to his robbery/shooting in Manhattan, New York at Quad Recording Studios - singling out the song's title (which many assumed connected to Biggie's \"Who Shot Ya?),\" certain lyrics, and the timing of release - which was the following year after the shooting incident. \n\nAlthough the track was stated by Keith Murray to not have any lyrical shots aimed at Tupac, Mobb Deep would respond in the following year to Tupac's \"Hit Em Up\" with \"Drop a Gem on 'Em,\" a promotional single from their 1996 album \"Hell On Earth. Ironically, \"I Shot Ya\" does feature a subliminal aim in Prodigy's verse to Murray, which continued friction that started sometime prior with an interlude from Mobb Deep's 1995 The Infamous album. The rivalry continued until sometime in 2012, when the two ended their rivalry by taking a picture together.\n\nA year and a half later, at the end of 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released \"Hell on Earth\", which debuted at number six on SoundScan. Its next release, \"Murda Muzik\", was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking, onto the streets and over the internet, rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded.\n\nIn November 2000, Prodigy released his debut solo album \"H.N.I.C.\". His follow up solo album would be released in 2008.\n\nBut during the next 6 years, between the release of his first two solo albums, Prodigy continued to work with Mobb Deep, releasing \"Infamy\" in 2001, \"Amerikaz Nightmare\" in 2004, and \"Blood Money\" in 2006.\n\nDuring this time, Prodigy had started work on his second solo album \"H.N.I.C. Part 2\", which was first previewed on his official mixtape \"The Return of the Mac,\" and was later released on the independent label Koch Records. The mixtape single, together with the mixtape video, was called \"Mac 10 Handle\". Prodigy then released H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 through Voxonic Inc., a company in which he was an equity holder. In late 2009, Mobb Deep was released from its contract with 50 Cent's G-Unit label.\n\nDuring this time period, Prodigy was served with a three-year sentence in Mid-State medium-security prison, following a plea agreement stemming from a gun-possession charge. He was officially released on March 7, 2011.\n\nProdigy was featured in the 2009 documentary, \"Rhyme and Punishment\", a film that documented Hip-Hop artists who have been incarcerated. In 2011, Prodigy released a free EP called \"The Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson EP\" which was his first project after he was released from prison. On April 21, a song titled \"The Type\", with Curren$y, was released on Curren$y's free album, entitled \"Covert Coup\".\n\nIn 2011, Prodigy released his autobiography, \"My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep's Prodigy.\" It was co-written with Laura Checkoway and published by Touchstone Books.\n\nIn 2013, Prodigy released his second collaboration album with the Alchemist titled \"Albert Einstein\". On April 1, 2014, Mobb Deep released \"The Infamous Mobb Deep\", their eighth studio album. In August 2016, he released an untitled EP of five tracks, released in partnership with BitTorrent, an association that Prodigy had been working up for a while.\n\nIn 2011, Prodigy released his autobiography, \"My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep's Prodigy.\" It was co-written with Laura Checkoway and published by Touchstone Books.\n\nIn 2013 Prodigy co-wrote the urban crime novel \"H.N.I.C.\" with British author Steven Savile. It was published by Akashic / Infamous Books. They also co-wrote a second novel, \" Ritual\", that was released in 2015 by Akashic.\n\nProdigy co-wrote a cookbook with Kathy Iandoli titled \"Commissary Kitchen: My Infamous Prison Cookbook\". It features a foreword by chef and food personality Eddie Huang and was published in 2016 by Infamous Books.\n\nThe following is a brief timeline and chronology of some of the legal issues that Prodigy faced during his life:\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997, the media-fueled \"East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry\" was occurring. This \"\" started when Tha Dogg Pound released \"New York, New York,\" to which Mobb Deep took offense as, in addition to the lyrics, the song's music video portrayed New York buildings being stomped on by Dogg Pound members. In response, Mobb Deep with Capone-N-Noreaga and Tragedy Khadafi released \"LA, LA\". 2Pac \"dissed\" Mobb Deep (along with The Notorious B.I.G.) in \"Hit 'Em Up\" where, in the outro of the song, he made a remark in clear reference to Prodigy's ailment in having sickle cell anemia. Mobb Deep responded in a track called \"Drop A Gem On 'Em\" which was released as a single 2 weeks before 2Pac was murdered. 2Pac also dissed Mobb Deep on the song \"\" and \"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\" which were released after his death. But Prodigy later sampled 2Pac's voice from a freestyle for the chorus on the song \"Return of the Mac\" (a.k.a. \"New York Shit\") on his album with the same name.\n\nOn \"The Infamous\" track \"The Infamous Prelude\", Prodigy made remarks about rappers who rap about \"smoking weed\" and talk about \"space shit\". Def Squad took offense from this, but the feud was settled when Prodigy and Keith Murray met at a video shoot. The feud was rekindled when Prodigy again referenced \"space shit\" in his appearance on LL Cool J's \"I Shot Ya\" which also featured Murray. Murray saw Prodigy at a club one night and punched him. Prodigy recalled the altercation and threatened Murray in the song \"In the Long Run\" on \"Hell on Earth\". Murray released a song \"Call My Name\" on his \"Enigma\" album dissing Mobb Deep. The feud seemed to die down until Prodigy dissed Murray again in his 2004 song \"Bad Blood.\" Murray has responded with numerous songs since. The feud has since died down, with the two sharing a photograph together with Busta Rhymes on social media. On Twitter, The reconciliation was confirmed by Prodigy in response to the photo not long after.\n\nDuring an interview, Prodigy stated that he did not like Saigon and Tru-Life (along with many other rappers).\n\nOn the night of September 19, 2007, after an impromptu performance by Saigon during a Mobb Deep show, words were exchanged between Saigon and Prodigy. This escalated into an argument, which resulted in a physical altercation when Saigon punched Prodigy twice before he (Saigon) left the club. Two video versions of the events have since emerged. One version, in slow motion footage, showed Saigon hiding under a table. Another released version of the video, showed Saigon running away from the club. The feud, however, apparently died down, since (in an interview two months before Prodigy's release from prison) Saigon expressed happiness that Prodigy was coming home.\n\nWhile in prison, Prodigy wrote a letter about his disillusionment with hip hop and rappers. He directly referenced Crooked I's name in the letter, commenting,\n\nCrooked I responded in a blog entry, and challenged Prodigy to a one-on-one fight upon the rapper's release. Following Prodigy's death, Crooked I paid tribute in honor of him by posting an image of him on Instagram.\n\nIn July 2012, Prodigy's musical partner, Havoc, wrote a series of derogatory comments about Prodigy on Twitter, including accusing Prodigy of engaging in homosexual relationships in prison. At first, Havoc claimed that his Twitter account was hacked. However, he later confirmed that he wrote the tweets and expressed his frustrations with Prodigy in an interview with AllHipHop. He stated that Mobb Deep was on an \"indefinite hiatus\" until the duo worked out their differences. Havoc later released a diss track aimed at Prodigy, which was titled \"Separated (Real from the Fake)\". Prodigy did not respond to Havoc's song and, even stated publicly, that Mobb Deep would eventually reconcile. In March 2013, the duo announced that they had reconciled and were going on tour.\n\nSome rap music has been inspired by the theory that a powerful international secret society exists. Often it is referred to as the Illuminati, after the Bavarian secret society founded in 1776. \"Complex\" magazine has claimed it was Prodigy who started the interest in the theory. Prodigy had often spoken publicly against the alleged international secret society during his life.\n\nProdigy rapped about a secret society in his collaboration with LL Cool J in the song \"I Shot Ya (Remix)\", from the 1995 album Mr. Smith. From prison in 2007, not long before the release of \"H.N.I.C. Part 2\", Prodigy wrote and published an \"open letter\" to Jay-Z in which he made some cryptic allegations alluding to the theory. In 2008, Prodigy titled a song \"Illuminati\", from \"H.N.I.C. Part 2\". In his final solo album released during his life, \"The Hegelian Dialectic\" (2017), Prodigy also referred to the theory. It was reported that Prodigy was working on a musical about his Illuminati theory at the time of his death.\n\nIn an interview with \"Vibe\" in November 2000, Prodigy spoke about what inspired him to directly address his battle with sickle-cell anemia in his song \"You Can Never Feel My Pain\", from his debut studio album \"H.N.I.C\". He attributes his nihilism to the \"permanent physical suffering\" caused by his lifelong battle with the condition.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, it was reported that Prodigy had died at the Spring Valley Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, while hospitalized for complications related to his sickle-cell anemia. He was performing in the Art of Rap Tour in Las Vegas with Havoc, Ghostface Killah, Onyx, KRS-One, and Ice-T when he was hospitalized.\n\nAccording to a coroner's report, Prodigy was admitted to Spring Valley Medical Center after suffering a significant medical episode arising from his life-long battle with sickle-cell anemia. Days later, on the morning of June 20, Prodigy was found unresponsive by hospital staff. It was reported at the time that Prodigy died from accidental choking. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of the family by The Gage Law Firm, alleges that the Spring Valley hospital breached their duty of care for Prodigy by \"failing to maintain a working IV access,\" and by \"failing to continuously monitor oxygen levels\" as ordered by physicians in the hospital, and that those failures led to Prodigy's death.\n\nStudio albums\n\nCollaboration albums\n\n\n\n"}

The elevation is 275 m.\n\nThe major growth of the last few years has been the creation of a huge industrial estate on flat land once covered by tomato plantations. This has brought new jobs and industries into the area and has spurred the development of a new purpose-built port which is due to open in 2007.\n\nThe district was not at one time a major tourist destination, but after the careful restoration of the old town, this has become the best example of a traditional Canarian hill town. The streets of the old town exude a gentle, relaxed, timeless atmosphere, and the carefully positioned street statues and sculptures add a series of surprises to a visit to the old town. The local plan for 'rural tourism' has led to the development of other small visitor centres on the district, the biggest of which is in the Guayadeque ravine. This area has many cave houses dating back hundreds of years, and a complete village excavated into the hillside, still occupied today, with its own cave chapel, cave bar and cave restaurants.\n\nThe Temisas Astronomical Observatory, on Montaña de Arriba near Temisas, is a popular visitor attraction, offering regular events related to astronomy.\n\nSporting activities are also very important in the area, with its windsurfing and scuba diving recognized as \"world class\". The windsurfing world cup at Pozo Izquierdo is an important event on the PWA World Tour. The whole of the coast in this area can provide challenging windsurfing conditions at any time of the year.\n\nThe main area for scuba diving in Gran Canaria is in the area known as the 'El Cabrón' marine reserve, next to the town of Arinaga. The diving in this area includes caves, arches, walls and volcanic reefs where an extremely wide range of sub-tropical marine species can be found, from tiny seahorses up to rays and angel sharks.\n\nIn the centre of the town, the large, domed in Plaza Nuestra Señora del Rosario is a noted example of Canarian Neoclassical architecture.

A right-hand batter and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Merchant played first-class cricket for Bombay cricket team as well as 10 Test matches for India between 1929 and 1951. Behind his limited Test appearances, he dominated Indian domestic cricket – his batting average of 71.64 is the second highest first-class average in history, behind only that of Don Bradman. He is regarded as the founder of the Bombay School of Batsmanship, that placed more importance on right technique, steely temperament, and conservative approach rather than free flow of the bat, a tradition broken and remoulded only after the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nHis international career included two tours of England upon which he scored over 800 runs. English cricketer C. B. Fry exclaimed \"Let us paint him white and take him with us to Australia as an opener.\" His brother, Uday, also played first-class cricket.\n\nBesides cricket, he was also associated with the Hindoostan Spinning & Weaving Mills (Thakersey Group).\n\nMerchant was born in Bombay, into a wealthy family in 1911. He was an \"outstanding college cricketer\" who captained Sydenham College, while studying there; his success for Sydenham led to selection for Hindus cricket team during the 1929 Bombay Quadrangular. He also continued to play for Sydenham and in 1931 he set the record in Bombay inter-collegiate cricket by scoring 504 runs and taking 29 wickets. His continued success in domestic cricket resulted in the call to the India national team to play against the visiting English team at Bombay Gymkhana, which was also the first Test to be played on Indian soil. Throughout his career, Merchant was involved in a rivalry with the other great Indian batsman of the era, Vijay Hazare. In the Bombay Pentangular match against the Rest, he bested Hazare's record of 242, set just in the previous match against the Muslims, with 250 not out. Hazare responded with a 309 out of a team total of 387 in the next innings, in what is generally held the greatest innings ever played in India before 1947. Merchant topped it by scoring 359 against Maharashtra in Ranji trophy.\n\nMerchant's Test career spanned 18 years but during that time he played only ten Test matches, and was unfortunate that some of the best years of his career were lost to the Second World War, when no international cricket was played. He also missed tours to Australia and the West Indies due to poor health. However, Merchant went out to score 154 in his last Test match against England in Delhi, which was also his highest Test score. A shoulder injury incurred while fielding in that game forced him to retire. All ten matches of Merchant's Test career were against England.\n\nMerchant had a particularly successful England tour of 1946. Despite facing difficulty against swing bowling when the ball moved away after pitching on the leg stump, he scored 2,385 runs including seven centuries in the 41 innings he batted, at an average of 74.53. In his column, former cricketer Learie Constantine wrote, \"... this (Merchant) world-beater so adapted himself to the circumstances that he produced cricket of the highest class, never refusing the challenge to score when the dice was not too heavily loaded against the side.\"\n\nMerchant went on to become a cricket administrator, broadcaster, writer and national selector, and charitable advocate of the handicapped.\n\n\"Cricket with Vijay Merchant\" was a radio programme hosted by Merchant. It was broadcast on Sunday afternoons, on Vividh Bharati, Anu D. Aggarwal quotes a survey, which revealed that it was one of the most listened to sponsored programmes.\n\nAlthough Vijay Merchant played only ten Test matches, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest batmen of his era. He was an attractive stroke maker, who \"developed fine footwork, and built a stroke repertoire featuring a lovely cut, grasscutting drives, a delicate glance and late-cut, and, until later in his career, a brilliant hook stroke.\" His batting average in first-class cricket was 71.64, putting him second only to Don Bradman of Australia. In India's domestic Ranji Trophy matches, he fared even better, averaging 98.75 in 47 innings. His record is especially impressive as his runs came at a time of uncovered wickets. Merchant was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1937. Vijay Merchant is also the oldest Indian player to score a Test century.

He was one half of the hip-hop duo Mobb Deep with Prodigy.\n\nHavoc is from the Queensbridge, Queens; his mother is from Brooklyn. His brother Killa Black is deceased. Havoc is the lead producer of Mobb Deep, and has produced songs for MCs such as Eminem, Nas, Foxy Brown, Onyx, The Notorious B.I.G., Jadakiss, Styles P, Method Man, The Game, Puff Daddy, LL Cool J, La The Darkman, Rohff, Big Noyd, Termanology, Per Vers, O.G.C., Tragedy Khadafi, Capone-N-Noreaga, and his own partner Prodigy on his solo work. In the spring of 2005, Mobb Deep was signed to fellow Queens rapper 50 Cent's record label G-Unit Records. In late 2009, 50 Cent dropped the pair from the label.\n\nHavoc is renowned among serious hip-hop fans as one of the prominent figures during the mid-1990s for his hard-hitting and stripped-down beats complementary to the RZA's work on Wu-Tang Clan projects. Popular music magazine Complex ranked Havoc among the top hip hop producers of 1995 after \"The Infamous\". Beattips.com ranked him as the 24th most influential beatmaker of all time citing his dual abilities of rapping and producing. Following \"The Infamous\", he tweaked his skills and transitioned to a more atmospheric production style that incorporated samples from classical music, most notably visible on the 1996 album \"Hell on Earth\". As a rapper, he is known for his hardcore lyricism and consistent flow. He also contributed background vocals and a verse on Black Moon's debut album \"Enta da Stage\" in 1993.\n\nIn July 2009, Havoc was featured alongside Raekwon in J Dilla's music video for \"24K Rap\" off of the \"Jay Stay Paid\" album, the video was directed by Derek Pike. In 2010, Havoc produced a beat for Eminem which resulted in a song called \"Untitled\" which is a hidden track on Eminem's album \"Recovery\" and contributed to the iTunes bonus track to Raekwon's album Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang & Bad Meets Evil's EP. He revealed that he plans on recording a new Mobb Deep album with Nas. His third studio album \"13\" was released on May 7, 2013.\n\nHavoc worked with Kavinsky on his 2013 album OutRun. He wrote the lyrics and sang the vocals for, \"Suburbia\", the sixth track on the album. In 2016, Havoc produced \"Real Friends\" and \"Famous\", two tracks on Kanye West's album \"The Life of Pablo\".\n\nMobb Deep's career ended in 2017 after the death of Prodigy.\n\nIn July 2012, Havoc wrote a series of derogatory comments about Prodigy on Twitter, including accusing Prodigy of engaging in homosexual relationships in prison. At first, Havoc claimed that his Twitter account was hacked. However, he later confirmed that he wrote the tweets and expressed his frustrations with Prodigy in an interview with AllHipHop. He stated that Mobb Deep was on an \"indefinite hiatus\" until the duo worked out their differences. Havoc later released a diss track aimed at Prodigy, which was titled \"Separated (Real from the Fake)\". Prodigy did not respond to Havoc's song and, even stated publicly, that Mobb Deep would eventually reconcile. In March 2013, the duo announced that they had reconciled and were going on tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHavoc is a playable character in the video game \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2017897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2017897", "title": "Conway's Soldiers", "text": "Conway's Soldiers\n\nConway's Soldiers or the checker-jumping problem is a one-person mathematical game or puzzle devised and analyzed by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1961. A variant of peg solitaire, it takes place on an infinite checkerboard. The board is divided by a horizontal line that extends indefinitely. Above the line are empty cells and below the line are an arbitrary number of game pieces, or \"soldiers\". As in peg solitaire, a move consists of one soldier jumping over an adjacent soldier into an empty cell, vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally), and removing the soldier which was jumped over. The goal of the puzzle is to place a soldier as far above the horizontal line as possible.\nConway proved that, regardless of the strategy used, there is no finite series of moves that will allow a soldier to advance more than four rows above the horizontal line. His argument uses a carefully chosen weighting of cells (involving the golden ratio), and he proved that the total weight can only decrease or remain constant. This argument has been reproduced in a number of popular math books.\n\nSimon Tatham and Gareth Taylor have shown that the fifth row can be reached via an \"infinite\" series of moves; this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke. If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can be reached but not the 9th row. It has also been shown that, in the \"n\"-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can be reached is 3\"n\" − 2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3\"n\" − 1 cannot be reached. It is considerably harder to show that row 3\"n\" − 2 can be reached (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).\n\nLet the target square be labeled formula_1, and all other squares be labeled formula_2, where formula_3 is the number of squares away (horizontally and vertically, as in manhattan distance) from the target square. If we consider the starting configuration of soldiers, below the thick red line, we can assign a score based on the sum of the values under each soldier, (e.g., formula_4 etc.) When a soldier jumps over another soldier, there are three cases to consider: \n\n\nWe want to ensure the total score never increases after any type of\nmove. This translates to three inequalities that must be satisfied simultaneously:\n\n\nSolving the quadratic equations formula_12 and formula_13 for their positive roots yields the solution:\n\nformula_14\n\nSince the proof requires the total score to be too small to reach the target square, we should make formula_15 as small as possible. We thus choose:\n\nformula_16. \n\nRearranging formula_17 we can see that:\n\nformula_18 and multiplying by formula_19 \n\nformula_20\n\nformula_21 \n\netc... \n\nSumming this to infinity causes all terms on the right hand side to cancel apart from the 1, i.e., \n\nformula_22\n\nThis can also be shown using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\nformula_23\n\nWhen formula_24 \n\nformula_25\n\nLet us take the first example, where the target square is in the first row above the red line. We now consider the maximum possible initial score, that is when every square has a soldier on it. The sum of the squares on the first row below the red line, is formula_26. (Drawing a diagram helps to visualise this). In the next line down, every square is one further away from the target square, and so has value formula_27 times the square above it, and so on for all the rows below the line. \n\nTherefore, the total value of all the squares below the line is equal to: \n\nformula_28.\n\nAt this stage we observe that formula_29 from above, and thus the above expression simplifies to:\n\nformula_30, using formula_31 for the last step. \n\nTherefore the sum of all the squares below the line when the target square is immediately above the line is formula_32.\n\nThe next case we consider is when the target square is in the second row above the red line. In this case each square under the red line is one square further away from the target square than in the previous example, so the total score now is found by multiplying the total score we obtained by formula_33 to give:\n\nformula_34.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nformula_35\n\nformula_36\n\nformula_37\n\nThus, we have shown that when the target square is five rows above the red line, the maximum possible original total score of all the soldiers is 1. With a finite number of soldiers the total will be less than one. Therefore, since any type of jump does not increase the total score, and the final score on all the soldiers must be at least 1 (formula_38 and the scores on any other soldiers left), the fifth row cannot be reached with a finite number of soldiers originally below the line. This completes the proof. \n\nformula_39\n\n"}

Slawi is known for the production of a particularly fragrant black tea and the tea drinking culture known as Moci.\n\nUnusual for a tea-producing area, Slawi has a warm climate with a gentle sloping geography.\n\nSlawi is located about 20 km south of Tegal at the central north coast of Java in Central Java province. It is bordered by Adiwerna (Banjaran) district to the north, the Pangkah district to the east, the Balapulang district to the south and the Jatibarang district (located in the administrative area of Brebes Regency) to the west.\n\nThe majority of citizens work as farmers, in the metal industry, the public service, or in a variety of home industries, including teak furniture-making and weaving sarongs.\n\nAs generally the case with 'urbanisation', many young people leave the area after high school, heading for larger urban centres such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang and some timber processing towns such as Banjarmasin and Balikpapan. In the last three decades, some are working overseas in places such as Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Their financial remittances are an important source of income for the area. The out of town family members would generally return to Slawi for the Moslem holidays of Idul Fitri as a tradition.\n\nLocal crafts include traditional forms of batik and metal working, and Wayang Kulit puppet shows are also performed.\n\nThe local language of the area is Javanese, spoken with a distinctive regional accent.\n\nThe local cuisine lists among others, Tahu Aci, fried tofu triangle with one side filled with cassava flour - represent the best vegetarian fried tofu among Asian cuisine. Sega Lengko, made of boiled and steamed rice adorned with fermented soybean cake pieces tempeh, tofu, soy-bean sprouts tauge, sand-fried peanuts and some hand crushed krupuk aci (cassava flour crackers) and/or krupuk udang (prawn crackers), fried shallots with mild chili peanut sauce over the top prior to serving. There is also variety of chicken turmeric soup, Soto Tegal, and Sate Tegal. There are many local food stalls, called Warteg (Warung Tegal), which offer daily meals at affordable prices for all walks of life.\n\nTea drinking at the small or large eatery has a famous local term called Moci - literally tea drinking from one small clay teapot with one teacup for each person. It is the way to drink the locally produced fragrant jasmine black tea. The teapot is filled with a small paper bag the size of matchbox full of jasmine tea and poured with slightly scalding hot water. The brewed tea is then poured into a clay teacup with rock sugar. The way the locals do is not to stir avoiding average sweetness, drink while it is hot preferably with some slurping noise as well. Some will pour it on the saucer and slurp it with abandon pleasure. The idea is to get to the last slurp or sip when it is sweetest and in this way encouraging refill. It somewhat reflects the Malay pantun proverb, 'berakit-rakit ke hulu/berenang-renang ke tepian/ bersakit-sakit dahulu/bersenang-senang kemudian', meaning there is a satisfying end to a difficult beginning. Not to be mistaken with the way the Russian drink their tea, by holding the rock sugar between the teeth and sip the tea.\n\nMoci is frequently accompanied by Mendoan, a moist fermented soybean cake (tempe or tempeh) fried in wheat fluor batter, often eaten with sambal ulek (oelek) or plain chilli paste or simply bite into one bird's eye chilli then bite a piece off the tempe. This is a favourite drink while enjoying the famous Sate Tegal, sate of local goat meat.\n\nThere are several beaches within easy reach of Slawi, as well as Guci, an area of waterfalls, gardens, and public hot springs at the foot of Slamet Mountain, approximately 27 km south of Slawi. In addition, nearby Alun Alun Kabupaten Slawi is a garden with a large fountain that is popular on Sundays.\n\nIn the town itself, there are the old and new markets, the Singa and Rama theatres, as well as the historical Pankah Sugar Factory, and the 4th Slawi Primary School, both of which are part of the Dutch colonial legacy in the city.\n"}

He spent years in various Russian monasteries and cathedrals, in Murom, Odessa and Pskov. In 1954 Pimen became namestnik (alderman) of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra.\n\nOn November 17, 1957, in Odessa, he was consecrated bishop of Balta, vicar of the Diocese of Odessa.\n\nBeginning December 26, 1957, he was bishop of Dmitrov, vicar of the Moscow diocese. From July 1960 to November 14, 1961, he was Chancellor of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nOn November 23, 1960, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. On March 16, 1961, he became archbishop of Tula and Belyov.\n\nOn November 14, 1961, he was appointed Metropolitan of Leningrad and Ladoga.\n\nAfter the death of Patriarch Alexius I in 1970, Metropolitan Pimen was chosen Patriarchal Locum Tenens, essentially a temporary replacement. Because 1970 was the centennial of Lenin's birth, Soviet authorities did not want a church council to select a new Patriarch during that year.\n\nA Local Council was opened May 30, 1971. On June 2, 1971, the final day of the Council, Metropolitan Pimen was elected Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. He was enthroned on June 3 of that year. (The other important act of the Council was the abolition of the \"oath\" on the old rites from the Great Moscow Council of 1667.)\n\nPimen's task was to lead a Christian church in a state ruled by an officially atheist Communist party. In his post, he worked closely with the Communist authorities, participating in numerous \"peace movement\" conferences sponsored by the government. Pimen was awarded the Soviet Peace Fund Medal (1969, 1971) and, in 1970, the Gold Medal \"Борцу за мир\" (\"Fighter for Peace\") by the 'Soviet Committee for the Defence of Peace'. Pimen was a member of the World Peace Council from 1963 onwards. In 1961, Pimen was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (орден Трудового Красного Знамени), one of the highest awards of the time.\n\nNear the end of his difficult term as head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he organized the celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus' in 1988. This event coincided with political reforms that ended much of the Communist party's anti-religious activity, and the church celebration was seen as marking the end of the persecution of Orthodox Christianity in the Soviet Union. When Patriarch Pimen died in 1990, the government made no effort to influence the choice of his successor. \n\n"}

It was a major producer of coal (and the world's largest exporter of thermal coal), copper, nickel, primary vanadium and zinc and the world's largest producer of ferrochrome. It had operations in 19 countries across Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America and South America.\n\nXstrata had a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately £29 billion as of 23 December 2011, making it the 16th-largest company on the London Stock Exchange. It had a secondary listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\n\nOn 2 May 2013 ownership of Xstrata was fully acquired by Glencore. Glencore has also announced that they will no longer use the 'Xstrata' brand and it will be phased out. Glencore Xstrata plc is now Glencore plc.\n\nAfter the reversed IPO in Q 4 2014 its global investment platform has diversified from its core mining activity as a private investment company. \n\nThe company was founded in 1926 in Switzerland as \"Südelektra\", an infrastructure and electricity projects concern operating in Latin America. In 1990, Marc Rich + Co AG became its majority shareholder. In the 1990s it diversified into mining and disposed of its non-core businesses.\n\nIt was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002 at which time it acquired Glencore's coal assets in Australia and South Africa.\n\nIn 2003, it doubled in size with the A$2.9 billion takeover of Australian copper, zinc and lead miner MIM Holdings. However, it failed in a 2005 bid for another Australian miner, WMC Resources, which was captured by BHP Billiton, the world's biggest mining company.\n\nIn 2004, Xstrata closed its recently purchased Windimurra Vanadium plant in Western Australia which had the effect of increasing Vanadium prices received for Xstrata's other Vanadium mines around the world. Many hundreds of people were put out of work and now many Western Australians are not keen to see Xstrata involved in other mining activities in the state because of this action.\n\nIn August 2005, Xstrata purchased a 19.9% stake in Falconbridge Limited, a diversified Canadian mining company producing copper, nickel, aluminum, lead and zinc. Following a contested take-over battle with Inco Limited, Xstrata successfully acquired the remaining 80.1% of Falconbridge in August 2006.\n\nIn 2006, The Northern Territory and Australian Governments approved the expansion of the McArthur River zinc mine, near the popular fishing destination of Borrooloola. The expansion involves diversion of the river to a new 5.5 km channel, to allow construction of a massive open-cut pit in the existing river.\nOn behalf of the Traditional Owners of the region – the Yanyuwa, Mara, Garrawa and Gurdanji peoples – the Northern Land Council launched a legal challenge to the Northern Territory Government's decision to approve the mining of and diversion of the McArthur River. On 1 May 2007, The Northern Territory Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Northern Land Council to stop the expansion. On 3 May 2007, the Northern Territory government rushed through retrospective legislation to overrule the court decision and allow the open-cut mine to proceed.\n\nOn 28 May 2012 violent repression of local residents by the police in the province of Espinar, Cuzco, Peru, caused the deaths of two civilians. The inhabitants protested against the pollution of the water sources caused by Xstrata's mining activities. The government has decreed a State of Emergency and suspended civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution.\n\nOn 2 May 2013 it was acquired by Glencore.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, due to friction with management and shareholders a reversed IPO took place and a Management/Shareholder buyout of the majority shares of the company was completed behind closed doors in the boardroom to one of the largest private Swiss and Luxembourg based global private asset management groups.\n\nXstrata shareholders regained full control of IOCG mining activities, the FTSE 100 company brand, IP and independence from Glencore holding group.\n\nXstrata Mexico continues its IED capital investment in Mexico and South America investing in geological studies, mineral resource classification, estimation of its Mining Assets/Claims and permits reaching a current valuation of US$200 million in IOCG reserves, which is part of the consolidated balance sheet of capital assets of the company.\n\nIn 2016, due to the sudden contraction of the global Chinese IO demand and subsequent melting of the global commodities markets including oil prices, Xstrata Mexico halted its mining activities in Mexico, though it maintained its IED position in the country.\n\nIn 2017, Xstrata begins investment diversification. It opens three of its actual nine divisions. Its Agroindustrial Division in Australia and Mexico – Xstrata Bioproducts - and signs off a JVA exclusive distribution agreement with Sukarne SA de CV to market and distribute Vio Hache 100% organic OMRI certified compost products. Exports to Japan begin.\n\nIn Q1 2018 Xstrata signed a majority shares/equity option offtake agreement with a Luxembourg-based Asset Management and Trust, thereby positioning Xstrata as a Private Investment Company. Its presence in Latin America will continue to grow with an approved multibillion Euros investment strategy for M&A in the Mining sector and all the core physical commodity derived productive sectors, as well as aerospace, agro-industrial, Biotechnology, Energy, Financial Services, Food & Technology, Health Care, infrastructure, IT, Logistics and Transport, real estate and Water Resources and conservation activities.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium it has developed from a small player into one of the world's largest diversified mining groups with the help of a series of large acquisitions. In 2008, its degree of transnationality according to the Transnationality Index was 93.2 percent and ranked first place. It has major operations/projects in eighteen countries (Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Germany, Jamaica, New Caledonia, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, the United States and the United Kingdom) and it is a major producer of copper, coking coal, thermal coal, nickel, ferrochrome, vanadium and zinc. It has smaller scale involvement in aluminum, gold, lead and silver. It also has interests in platinum group metals through its 24.9% stake in Lonmin.\n\nIn July 2012, Xstrata opened its first office in mainland China. China accounts for up to one-third of Xstrata's global sales. The office is located in Shanghai.\n\nXstrata are currently the operators of the Bulga Coal Mine in NSW, Australia. Xstrata have managed this mine on behalf of the Bulga Coal Pty Ltd shareholders since 2001 when it purchased Enex Resources Limited from Glencore International AG. The Bulga Coal mine site serves as the headquarters for Xstrata Coal's NSW division.\n\nIn 2007 Xstrata Coal, based in Sydney, bought Anvil Hill Coal Mine from Centennial Coal Company. Since the purchase of the Anvil Hill Coal Mine, Xstrata Coal, an Australia-based subsidiary of Xstrata PLC, has come under media scrutiny numerous times in regards to the company's management of the pre-mining stage of the mining project, most notably scrutinised has been the community relations approach of Xstrata Coal towards the local community, with allegations of misleading actions on behalf of the company being cited in the local and regional media, and other regional and local communication channels. This included the setting up of a local action group in opposition to the mine named WAG (Wybong Action Group).\n\nIn October 2010, Xstrata's A$274 million expansion plan for the George Fisher mine at Mount Isa was approved by the government of Queensland\n\nXstrata's $5.9-billion copper-gold mine in the Philippines’ southern island of Mindanao has been delayed three years to 2019 due to security concerns and regulatory obstacles set by the local government. It was the largest FDI project in the Philippines.\n\nGlencore is reported to serve as a marketing partner for Xstrata. As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte and Ivan Glasenberg are on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chairs. According to \"The Sunday Times\", Glencore controls 40% of Xstrata stock and has appointed the Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.\n\nIn June 2012, following a previous announcement of a merger between Glencore and Xstrata, the two companies began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, due to shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.\n\nIn July 2012, Xstrata PLC announced that the Court Meeting originally scheduled for 12 July 2012 to approve the details of the merger between Xstrata and Glencore had been adjourned to 7 September 2012. After the merger with Glencore, the Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would not continue to work as employee but as consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marks a massive shift in the company's strategy and the group is entering a post-Reid era.\n\nThe Xstrata name, which evokes the activities of mining and extraction, was suggested in 1999 by John Lloyd of the British corporate identity consultancy Lloyd Northover. Glencore has also announced that they will no longer use the 'Xstrata' brand and it will be phased out. Glencore Xstrata plc is now Glencore plc. Xstrata is a wholly owned brand and trademark of Xstrata, SICAV.\n"}

It was published for two periods in the 19th century, and was revived in 1929.\n\nThe current newspaper shares its title with a 19th century publication, and claims to be a continuation of the original publication. The first paper to bear the name of \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" was founded by a literary group led by Anton Delvig and Alexander Pushkin, whose profile to this day adorns the paper's masthead. The first issue appeared on January 1, 1830. The paper appeared regularly until June 30, 1831, reappearing in 1840–1849. Pushkin himself published some of his most famous works in this paper. \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" was the first to publish Gogol, and published works by Baratynsky, Belinsky, Nekrasov and many other Russian authors.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the Soviet literary establishment decided to resume the venture on April 22, 1929, and the paper has been published regularly ever since. From 1929 to 1932, \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" was the official organ of the Federation of Unions of Soviet Writers, which had as its stated aim \"to foster in the area of creative writing the principle of free competition of the various groupings and tendencies\". In 1932, however, \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" became the official organ of the Union of Soviet Writers, the government-controlled organization responsible for most literary publication and employment of writers in the USSR.\n\nIn 1947, the format of \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" was changed from a purely literary publication into a newspaper with political and social content as well. It was published weekly in an edition of sixteen pages, the first \"thick newspaper\" in a country where most newspapers were four to eight pages in length. The expanded newspaper not only took on a new look, but also acquired greater influence, becoming one of the most authoritative and influential publications. Though \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\", like all newspapers during the Soviet period, faithfully reflected government policy (both political and literary), it showed, as much as possible, the human face of Soviet society, and was the national paper most likely to \"push the limits\" (though those limits were fairly severe). The newspaper published stories and poems that were often mundane and unimpressive, but occasionally published poetry and prose of quality. Most interesting to its readers were reports on the international political scene, and especially on cultural life in countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence. \n\nEspecially popular was the last page of each issue, which contained a variety of satirical articles and cartoons under the rubric \"Twelve Chairs Club\" (an allusion to the well-known comic novel by Ilf and Petrov). Under the protective guise of good-natured, constructive satire, various frustrating and unsavory aspects of Soviet life could be discussed that were scarcely acknowledged in other publications.\n\nIn 1990, with the end of the Soviet Union, the newspaper became an independent collective, and in 1997 formed itself into a publicly traded company.\n\n\n"}

It is one of two United States offshoots of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) after breaking with the JDL's former leader Meir Kahane.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the JDO is a branch of Kahanism. The JDO opposes the ADL and believes that ADL head Abe Foxman obtained a pardon for Marc Rich after Rich made a contribution to the ADL. The Anti-Defamation League states that:\n\nThe Kahanist movement – comprising the Jewish Defense League (JDL) and the Jewish Defense Organization (JDO) in the United States, the Kach (Hebrew for \"thus\" or \"this is the way\") Party in Israel, and the Kahane Chai (\"Kahane Lives\") group, founded after Kahane's murder and operating both in Israel and in the U.S. – has spanned 26 years, reflecting a consistent agenda of hate, fear-mongering and intimidation. Rand Corporation terrorism authority Bruce Hoffman, notes that \"terrorist organizations almost without exception now regularly select names for themselves that consciously eschew the word 'terrorism' in any of its forms.\" He cites the JDO as an example of an organisation that has chosen such a name.\n\nThe JDO is right-wing in its stance on Israeli defense and foreign policy issues. Its positions on issues of Jewish concern in the US are more nuanced, and it has criticized both right-wing and left-wing manifestations of what it sees as anti-Semitism and racism with equal rhetorical fervor. It has worked with both left-wing and right-wing Jews on problems involving bigotry. The JDO has targeted Jewish organizations that it deems to be insufficiently supportive of Zionism.\n\nThe JDO takes no stance on most domestic US issues unless they relate directly to anti-Semitism, or Zionism. An exception to this rule is gun control, which the group strongly opposes.\n\nThe JDO's security team has occasionally patrolled Jewish neighborhoods in the aftermath of anti-Semitic incidents, and has urged other Jewish groups to do likewise. JDO members attempted to help provide security in Crown Heights during the 1991 Crown Heights Riot. The group has engaged in fights against neo-Nazis and white power skinheads in Las Vegas and other cities. It has also demonstrated, without incident, against Louis Farrakhan in New York City. The JDO often gives its demonstrations pseudo-military names, such as \"Operation Klan Kicker\" or \"Operation Nazi Kicker\"\n\nIn 2004, the JDO held rallies at an apartment house on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where a neo-Nazi activist and Holocaust denier ran his operation. In 1989, it launched a boycott of the rap group Public Enemy in response to allegedly anti-Semitic remarks by Professor Griff, its self-styled Minister of Information. As a result of the media controversy, Griff temporarily left the band, and Public Enemy apologized for his remarks.\n\nThe JDO has adopted a tactic of pressuring hotels and other public facilities to cancel meetings sponsored by anti-Semites such as David Duke. In early 2004, the JDO waged a phone-in campaign to pressure a Florida company to remove billboard messages sponsored by the National Alliance, an organization widely regarded as neo-Nazi. In September 2006 Columbia University scrapped plans for an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad because of security and logistical problems. The move came as the JDO expressed outrage that the hard-line leader had been invited to speak.\n\nIn late 2006 the JDO initiated Operation Screwball, aimed at the small Haredi Jewish group Neturei Karta. In 2007, the JDO helped organize a demonstration in which several hundred Orthodox Jews protested against Neturei Karta, some of whose members had been attending a Holocaust denial conference in Iran. The protesters shouted \"Nazi traitors! Go back to Iran! You are killing Jews!\" at members of Neturei Karta in the Rockland County community of Monsey. On January 14, 2007, 200 JDO members and sympathizers gathered outside a Brooklyn hotel to protest the presence of Moshe Aryeh Friedman, an anti-Israel rabbi who spoke at a Holocaust-denial conference in Iran.\n\nIn June 2007, New York City Police investigated the JDO after it plastered fliers over Brooklyn Councilman Charles Barron's office, calling him an anti-Semite for voting for a defeated proposal to name a street after controversial black nationalist activist Sonny Carson.\n\nLevy and the JDO's involvement led to accusations that the group inflamed divisions at Rutgers University in 1995, where African American students had protested against comments made by then-President Francis L. Lawrence that were perceived as anti-Black. The JDO accused the protesting black students of themselves being racist and anti-Semitic. Levy's involvement was met with apprehension by some members of the Rutgers Jewish community. Rabbi Norman Weitzner of Rutgers felt there was no anti-Semitism involved and noted \"The JDO sees anti-Semitism at the drop of a hat, when it may not actually exist.\" The interim director of Rutgers Hillel said at the time that Levy \"thinks he's going to wake up the Jewish students. What's going to happen is that he's going to start a racial war.\"\n\nMark \"Mordechai\" Levy is the founder and leader of the JDO, and the only JDO member to receive substantial notice in the press. He spends much of his time promoting the JDO's Camp Jabotinsky, which provides self-defense and gun training for young Jews at a facility in the Catskills. Levy is an avid follower of Vladimir Jabotinsky, after whom the camp is named, and often repeats Jabotinsky's motto: \"Better to know how to shoot and not need to, than to need to and not know how.\"\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, Levy had an antagonistic relationship with Irv Rubin of the Jewish Defense League. The two of them nearly came to blows during a Los Angeles press conference in 1989, and later that year Levy was charged with four counts of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, and one count of criminal possession of a deadly weapon after shooting at Rubin from a rooftop in New York City. Rubin was attempting to serve Levy with a subpoena in a slander suit. The rooftop was that of the apartment dwelling of JDO activist A. J. Weberman, also known for his activism in the Youth International Party (Yippies). Levy and Weberman, along with JDO, were successfully sued for libel more recently and fined $850,000. Levy was acquitted of all charges except one count of felony assault with a deadly weapon, for which he served 18 months of a 4½ year sentence.\n\nLevy pleaded guilty in 2000 to unrelated charges of assaulting a 12-year-old boy in New York State after the boy attempted to set fire to a hotel where the JDO was holding a meeting.\n\n\n"}
