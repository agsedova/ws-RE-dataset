It covers an area of along the Murray River from where it flows into South Australia from New South Wales and Victoria downstream to Blanchetown. The major town centres are Renmark, Berri, Loxton, Waikerie, Barmera and Monash, along with many minor townships; the population is approximately 35,000 people.\n\nThe Riverland is located 1.75 to 3 hours (or ) north east of Adelaide, and 90 minutes west (or ) from Mildura, Victoria via the Sturt Highway.\n\nThe Riverland has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and relatively mild winters, with temperatures a few degrees above those of Adelaide. The average summer temperature is , with a winter average of and an average rainfall of .\n\nThe Riverland's history is strongly linked to irrigation and the area's suitability for growing crops. The region enjoys a warm Mediterranean climate, and has vast acres of fertile soil and a readily available water source in the Murray River.\n\nThe first district to be established in the region was Renmark in 1887 by the Chaffey Brothers, who also established the Mildura Irrigation District in the neighbouring upstream Region of Sunraysia. Other settlements followed in the 1890s at: Holder, Kingston, Lyrup, Moorook, Murtoa, New Era, New Renmark, Pyap, Ramco and Waikerie.\n\nSome of these irrigation schemes were developed as a government response to the economic depression of the 1890s, where the aim was to keep energy, talent and capital from leaving South Australia using Village Settlement Schemes.\n\nIn 1901 a Royal Commission recommended that the settlements be subdivided and leased to individual settlers instead of village associations, and over time most of these areas became government irrigation areas.\n\nSoldier settlement schemes were later allotted for returned servicemen at: Berri, Chaffey, Cadell and Cobdogla from 1917. Loxton and Cooltong were allotted from 1946 on. During World War II, the region hosted an internment camp for people of Japanese, German and Italian origin or descent. This camp was based at Loveday but little remains today to indicate its existence.\n\nIn 1956 and 1961 the privately developed Sunlands/Golden Heights schemes were established. As pumping technology became more affordable and efficient, more recent development occurred through private irrigation, where irrigators operated their own pumping infrastructure pumping water from the River. Water trade enabled further growth in these properties from the early 1990s with the Riverland purchasing water from pasture users in upstream states, or from the downstream lower Murray region, to expand the winegrape and almond industries. Some of this development was funded through managed investment schemes. Now the majority of irrigation is from private infrastructure.\n\nThe Central Irrigation Trust manages most of the community supplied districts with a total of 13,000 ha. There is also the Renmark Irrigation Trust, which supplies water to 4,700 ha. All the water is supplied from the River Murray. Many of the towns were established for the re-settlement of soldiers after their return from World War I or World War II. Most towns were established as separate irrigation districts.\n\nThe Riverland's economy is driven by primary production. The region has sustainable comparative advantages for high value irrigated horticulture including soils, climate, reliability of water supply, best practice water supply systems, ability to grow a diversity of crops, fruit fly free status and proximity to markets.\n\nThe area is Australia's largest wine-producing region, growing over half (63 per cent in 2014) of South Australia's wine grapes. Most major Australian wine companies source a significant amount of bulk wine from the Riverland.\n\nIn 2013 the region produced 22 per cent of Australia's wine grape crush with approximately 21,000 hectares under wine grapes, which was produced by over 1,000 growers.\n\nThe Riverland is also a significant almond and stone fruit-growing region, producing 18 per cent of Australia's almonds and 7 per cent of Australia's fresh stone fruit.\n\nRiverland juices and milk drinks are stocked on supermarket shelves across Australia and internationally.\n\nThe agriculture industry is the largest employer in the area with approximately 3000 farm based businesses in the Riverland Region.\n\nThe Riverland is located on the main eastern state transit link, which connects Adelaide to the eastern states.\n\nRoad: The Sturt Highway, a part of the National Highway Network, is the major highway connecting the Riverland Region with interstate and overseas freight connections at Adelaide's Outer Harbor and Adelaide Airport. Main roads provide regional access between towns, as well as alternative routes to major regional areas such as Murray Bridge.\n\nAir: Renmark has a regional airport that provides services for light planes, and potential for future expansion of commuter services. Waikerie airport has a sealed runway and is an operating airfield.\n\nThe region is known for its natural wonders, with the opportunity to go for guided and self-guided walks, horse-riding or bike riding (both mountain biking or cycling), canoeing or kayaking on the river and creeks. Lake Bonney provides opportunities for sailing, zorbing or windsurfing. Lake Bonney was also the site where on 23 November 1964, Donald Campbell achieved the Australian Water Speed Record of in his boat, the BlueBird.\n\nThe region also has a vibrant Motorsports culture with options for 4-wheel driving, trail bike or motocross riding, go-kart and speedway.\n\nRenmark is well known for its annual Rose Festival, a 10-day long event held in October each year, which is a major tourist attraction. The very first Rose Week was run in 1994, and was the brainchild of Eithne Sidhu who collaborated with David Ruston, who owns Australia's largest rose garden (27 acres) and houses the National Rose Collection.\n\nStarting with a single Christmas light display out on a property in Loxton North, the Loxton Christmas Lights Festival today incorporates many homes throughout the township, and attracts thousands of visitors to the region over the period from November through December each year. It began when Peter Mangelsdorf was inspired to start a small Christmas display known as Christmas Wonderland. The frontage of Peter's property is filled with a magnificent display of Christmas lights and images, ranging from Bethlehem scenes to popular characters dressed for the festive season.\n\nHeld in mid-October each year, the Riverland Food and Wine is the region's main food and wine event showcasing local wines, ales, ciders, spirits in addition to local cuisine. Held on the banks of the Murray River, the day includes entertainment, and has become a popular event with locals and visitors alike.\n\nDestination Riverland is the Riverland's tourism body, with this industry worth around $148 million annually.\n\nThe region is represented at a State level in the House of Assembly by local Liberal Member for Chaffey, Tim Whetstone MP. Federally, Liberal Member for Barker, Tony Pasin MP is the region's representative in the House of Representatives. Local, Anne Ruston is a Federal Senator for South Australia.\n\n\nThere are four public high schools across the Riverland region:\n\n\n\nTAFE SA has a centrally located campus in Berri.\n\nThe predominant natural environment consists of River Red Gum and Black Box forests that line the river banks and flood plains, as well as steep cliffs. The Riverland is abundant in wildlife, the more common species encountered being Pelicans, Kookaburras, Brush Tail Possums and Perons Tree Frogs. Less common species include Koalas (introduced to Renmark), Bush Stone Curlews and Carpet Pythons (rated 'vulnerable' to extinction in the region).\n\nRiverlanders share an interest in the health of the River Murray. The Riverland region lies in the southern part of the Murray Darling Basin where the broad River Murray floodplain and its river meanders for approximately through red sandy Mallee dune landscapes. Several conservation reserves protect biodiversity and provide for conservation and wise use activities.\n\nProtected area associated with the River Murray include Murray River National Park, Loch Luna Game Reserve and Moorook Game Reserve. Mallee landscape reserves include Chowilla Regional Reserve, Billiatt Conservation Park, Pooginook Conservation Park, Calperum Station and several privately owned reserves including Birds Australia's Gluepot Reserve. In the river valley, there are several hundred wetlands including two Ramsar wetlands of international importance — Banrock Station Wetland Complex and the Riverland Wetland which encompasses Chowilla floodplain, and other wetlands including Pike River basin, Gurra Gurra wetlands and Katarapko Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The pharmaceutical analogs of naturally occurring GM-CSF are called sargramostim and molgramostim.\n\nUnlike granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which specifically promotes neutrophil proliferation and maturation, GM-CSF affects more cell types, especially macrophages and eosinophils.\n\nGM-CSF is a monomeric glycoprotein that functions as a cytokine — it is a white blood cell growth factor. GM-CSF stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and monocytes. Monocytes exit the circulation and migrate into tissue, whereupon they mature into macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, it is part of the immune/inflammatory cascade, by which activation of a small number of macrophages can rapidly lead to an increase in their numbers, a process crucial for fighting infection.\n\nGM-CSF also has some effects on mature cells of the immune system. These include, for example, enhancing neutrophil migration and causing an alteration of the receptors expressed on the cells surface.\n\nGM-CSF signals via signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT5. In macrophages, it has also been shown to signal via STAT3. The cytokine activates macrophages to inhibit fungal survival. It induces deprivation in intracellular free zinc and increases production of reactive oxygen species that culminate in fungal zinc starvation and toxicity. Thus, GM-CSF facilitates development of the immune system and promotes defense against infections.\n\nGM-CSF also plays a role in embryonic development by functioning as an embryokine produced by reproductive tract.\n\nThe human gene has been localized in close proximity to the interleukin 3 gene within a T helper type 2-associated cytokine gene cluster at chromosome region 5q31, which is known to be associated with interstitial deletions in the 5q- syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. GM-CSF and IL-3 are separated by an insulator element and thus independently regulated. Other genes in the cluster include those encoding interleukins 4, 5, and 13.\n\nHuman granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is glycosylated in its mature form.\n\nGM-CSF was first cloned in 1985, and soon afterwards three potential drug products were being made using recombinant DNA technology: molgramostim was made in \"Escherichia coli\" and is not glycosylated, sargramostim was made in yeast, has a leucine instead of proline at position 23 and is somewhat glycosylated, and regramostim was made in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and has more glycosylation than sargramostim. The amount of glycosylation affects how the body interacts with the drug and how the drug interacts with the body.\n\nAt that time, Genetics Institute, Inc. was working on molgramostim, Immunex was working on sargramostim (Leukine), and Sandoz was working on regramostim.\n\nMolgramostim was eventually co-developed and co-marketed by Novartis and Schering-Plough under the trade name Leucomax for use in helping white blood cell levels recover following chemotherapy, and in 2002 Novartis sold its rights to Schering-Plough.\n\nSargramostim was approved by the US FDA in 1991 to accelerate white blood cell recovery following autologous bone marrow transplantation under the trade name Leukine, and passed through several hands, ending up with Genzyme which subsequently was acquired by Sanofi. Leukine is now owned by Partner Therapeutics (PTx).\n\nImlygic was approved by the US FDA in October 2015, and in December 2015 by the EMA, as an oncolytic virotherapy, commercialized by Amgen Inc. This oncolytic herpes virus, named Talimogene laherparepvec, has been genetically engineered to express human GM-CSF using the tumor cells machinery.\n\nGM-CSF is found in high levels in joints with rheumatoid arthritis and blocking GM-CSF as a biological target may reduce the inflammation or damage. Some drugs (e.g. otilimab) are being developed to \"block\" GM-CSF. In critically ill patients GM-CSF has been trialled as a therapy for the immunosuppression of critical illness, and has shown promise restoring monocyte and neutrophil function, although the impact on patient outcomes is currently unclear and awaits larger studies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1899258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899258", "title": "Counting single transferable votes", "text": "Counting single transferable votes\n\nThe single transferable vote (STV) is a voting system based on proportional representation and ranked voting. Under STV, an elector's vote is initially allocated to his or her most-preferred candidate. After candidates have been either elected (\"winners\") by reaching \"quota\" or eliminated (\"losers\"), \"surplus\" votes are transferred from winners to remaining candidates (\"hopefuls\") according to the surplus ballots' ordered preferences.\n\nThe system minimizes \"wasted\" votes and allows for approximately proportional representation without the use of party lists. A variety of algorithms (methods) carry out these transfers.\nWhen using an STV ballot, the voter ranks the candidates on the ballot. For example:\n\nThe quota (sometimes called the threshold) is the number of votes a candidate must receive to be elected. The Hare quota and the Droop quota are commonly used to determine the quota.\n\nWhen Thomas Hare originally conceived his version of Single Transferable Vote, he envisioned using the quota:\n\nIn the unlikely event that each successful candidate receives exactly the same number of votes, not enough candidates can meet the quota and fill the available seats in one count. Thus the last candidate cannot not meet the quota, and it may be fairer to eliminate that candidate.\n\nTo avoid this situation, it is common instead to use the Droop quota, which is always lower than the Hare quota.\n\nThe most common quota formula is the Droop quota, which given as:\n\nDroop produces a lower quota than Hare. If each ballot has a full list of preferences, Droop guarantees that every winner meets the quota rather than being elected as the last remaining candidate after lower candidates are eliminated. The fractional part of the resulting number, if any, is dropped (the result is rounded down to the next whole number.)\n\nIt is only necessary to allocate enough votes to ensure that no other candidate still in contention could win. This leaves nearly one quota's worth of votes unallocated, but counting these would not alter the outcome.\n\nDroop is the only whole-number threshold for which (a) a majority of the voters can be guaranteed to elect a majority of the seats when there is an odd number of seats; (b) for a fixed number of seats.\n\nEach winner's surplus votes transfer to other candidates according to their remaining preferences, using a formula \"s/t*p\", where \"s\" is a number of surplus votes to be transferred, \"t\" is a total number of transferable votes (that have a second preference) and \"p\" is a number of second preferences for the given candidate. Meek's counting method recomputes the quota on each iteration of the count.\n\nTwo seats need to be filled among four candidates: Andrea, Brad, Carter, and Delilah. 57 voters cast ballots with the following preference orderings:\n\nThe quota is calculated as formula_1.\n\nIn the first round, Andrea receives 40 votes and Delilah 17. Andrea is elected with 20 surplus votes. Ignoring how the votes are valued for this example, 20 votes are reallocated according to their second preferences. 12 of the reallocated votes go to Carter, 8 to Brad.\n\nAs none of the hopefuls have reached the quota, Brad, the candidate with the fewest votes, is excluded. All of his votes have Carter as the next-place choice, and are reallocated to Carter. This gives Carter 20 votes and he fills the second seat.\n\nThus:\n\nUnder the single transferable vote system, votes are successively transferred to hopefuls from two sources:\n\n\nThe possible algorithms for doing this differ in detail, e.g., in the order of the steps. There is no general agreement on which is best, and the choice of exact method may affect the outcome.\n\n\nIf all seats have winners, the process is complete. Otherwise:\n\n\nTo minimize wasted votes, surplus votes are transferred to other candidates. The number of surplus votes is known; but none of the various allocation methods is universally preferred. Alternatives exist for deciding which votes to transfer, how to weight the transfers, who receives the votes and the order in which surpluses from two or more winners are transferred. Reallocation occurs when a candidate receives more votes than necessary to meet the quota. The excess votes are reallocated to still other candidates.\n\nSome surplus allocation methods select a random vote sample. Sometimes, ballots of one elected candidate are manually mixed. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, votes are counted one precinct at a time, imposing a spurious ordering on the votes. To prevent all transferred ballots coming from the same precinct, every formula_2th ballot is selected, where formula_3 is the fraction to be selected.\n\nReallocation ballots are drawn at random from those transferred. In a manual count of paper ballots, this is the easiest method to implement; it is close to Thomas Hare's original 1857 proposal. It is used in elections in the Republic of Ireland to Dáil Éireann (the house of representatives), to local government, to the European Parliament, and to the university constituencies in Seanad Éireann. Exhausted ballots cannot be reallocated, and therefore do not contribute to any candidate.\n\nReallocation ballots are drawn at random from all of the candidate's votes. This method is more likely than Hare to be representative, and less likely to suffer from exhausted ballots. The starting point for counting is arbitrary. Under a recount the same sample and starting point is used in the recount (i.e., the recount must only be to check for mistakes in the original count, and not a second selection of votes).\n\nHare and Cincinnati have the same effect for first-count winners, since all the winners' votes are in the \"last batch received\" from which the Hare surplus is drawn.\n\nThe Wright system is a reiterative linear counting process where on each candidate's exclusion the quota is reset and the votes recounted, distributing votes according to the voters' nominated order of preference, excluding candidates removed from the count as if they had not nominated.\n\nFor each successful candidate that exceeds the quota threshold, calculate the \"ratio\" of that candidate's surplus votes (i.e., the excess over the quota) divided by the total number of votes for that candidate, including the value of previous transfers. Transfer that candidate's votes to each voter's next preferred hopeful. Increase the recipient's vote tally by the product of the ratio and the ballot's value as the previous transfer (1 for the initial count.)\n\nThe UK's Electoral Reform Society recommends essentially this method. Every preference continues to count until the choices on that ballot have been exhausted or the election is complete. Its main disadvantage is that given large numbers of votes, candidates and/or seats, counting is administratively burdensome for a manual count due to the number of interactions. This is not the case with the use of computerised distribution of preference votes.\n\nFrom May 2011 to June 2011, The Proportional Representation Society of Australia reviewed the Wright System noting:\n\nThis is a variation on the original Hare method that used random choices. It is used in some elections in Australia. It allows votes to the same ballots to be repeatedly transferred. The surplus value is calculated based on the allocation of preference of the last bundle transfer. The last bundle transfer method has been criticised as being inherently flawed in that only one segment of votes is used to transfer the value of surplus votes denying voters who contributed to a candidate's surplus a say in the surplus distribution. In the following explanation, Q is the quota required for election.\n\n\nExample: If Q is 200 and a winner has 272 first-choice votes, of which 92 have no other hopeful listed, surplus is 72, ratio is 72/(272−92) or 0.4. If 75 of the reassigned 180 ballots have hopeful X as their second-choice, and if X has 190 votes, then X becomes a winner, with a surplus of 20 for the next round, if needed.\n\nThe Australian variant of step 7 treats the loser's votes as though they were surplus votes. But redoing the whole method prevents what is perhaps the only significant way of gaming this system – some voters put first a candidate they are sure will be eliminated early, hoping that their later preferences will then have more influence on the outcome.\n\nAnother method, known as \"Senatorial rules\" (after its use for most seats in Irish Senate elections), or the \"Gregory method\" (after its inventor in 1880, J. B. Gregory of Melbourne) eliminates all randomness. Instead of transferring a \"fraction\" of votes at \"full\" value, transfer \"all\" votes at a \"fractional\" value.\n\nIn the above example, the relevant fraction is formula_4. Note that part of the 272 vote result may be from earlier transfers; e.g., perhaps Y had been elected with 250 votes, 150 with X as next preference, so that the previous transfer of 30 votes was actually 150 ballots at a value of formula_5. In this case, these 150 ballots would now be retransferred with a compounded fractional value of formula_6.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Gregory Method is used for elections to the 43 seats on the vocational panels in Seanad Éireann, whose franchise is restricted to 949 members of local authorities and members of the Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament). In Northern Ireland, the Gregory Method has been used since 1973 for all STV elections, with up to 7 fractional transfers (in 8-seat district council elections), and up to 700,000 votes counted (in 3-seat European Parliament elections for the Northern Ireland constituency from 1979 to 2020).\n\nAn alternative means of expressing Gregory in calculating the \"Surplus Transfer Value\" applied to each vote is\n\nThe Unweighted Inclusive Gregory Method is used for the Australian Senate.\n\nSuppose a ballot is to be transferred and its next preference is for a winner in a prior round. Hare and Cincinnati ignore such preferences and transfer the ballot to the next preference.\n\nOr the vote could be transferred to that winner and the process continued. For example, a prior winner X could receive 20 transfers from second round winner Y. Then select 20 at random from the 220 for transfer from X. However, some of these 20 ballots may then transfer back from X to Y, creating recursion. In the case of the Senatorial rules, since all votes are transferred at all stages, the recursion is infinite, with ever-decreasing fractions.\n\nIn 1969, B.L. Meek devised an algorithm based on Senatorial rules, which uses an iterative approximation to short-circuit this infinite recursion. This system is currently used for some local elections in New Zealand, and for elections of moderators on some internet websites, e.g. Stack Exchange Network portals.\n\nAll candidates are allocated one of three statuses – Hopeful, Elected, or Excluded. Hopeful is the default. Each status has a \"weighting\", or \"keep value\", which is the fraction of the vote a candidate will receive for any preferences allocated to them while holding that status.\n\nThe weightings are:\n\nThus, if a candidate is Hopeful they retain the whole of the remaining preferences allocated to them, and subsequent preferences are worth 0.\n\nIf a candidate is Elected they retain the portion of the value of the preferences allocated to them that is the value of their \"weighting\"; the remainder is passed fractionally to subsequent preferences depending on their weighting, using the formula:\n\nFor example, consider a ballot with top preferences A, B, C, where the \"weightings\" of the three candidates are formula_9, formula_10, formula_11 respectively. From this ballot A will retain formula_9, B will retain formula_13, and C will retain formula_14.\n\nThis may result in a fractional excess, which is disposed of by altering the quota. Meek's method is the only method to change quota mid-process. The quota is found by\na variation on Droop. This has the effect of also altering the \"weighting\" for each candidate.\n\nThis process continues until all the Elected candidates' vote values closely match the quota (plus or minus .0001%).\n\nIn 1994, C. H. E. Warren proposed another method of passing surplus to previously-elected candidates. Warren is identical to Meek except in the numbers of votes retained by winners. Under Warren, rather than retaining that proportion of each vote's value given by multiplying the \"weighting\" by the vote's value, the candidate retains that amount of a whole vote given by the \"weighting\", or else whatever remains of the vote's value if that is less than the \"weighting\".\n\nConsider again a ballot with top preferences A, B, C, where the \"weightings\" are \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". Under Warren's method, A will retain \"a\", B will retain \"b\" (or (1−\"a\") if (1−\"a\")<\"b\"), and C will retain \"c\" (or (1−\"a\"−\"b\") if (1−\"a\"−\"b\")<\"c\" — or 0 if (1−\"a\"−\"b\") is already less than 0).\n\nBecause candidates receive different values of votes, the \"weightings\" determined by Warren are in general different than Meek.\n\nUnder Warren, every vote that contributes to a candidate contributes, as far as it is able, the same portion as every other such vote.\n\nThe method used in determining the order of exclusion and distribution of a candidates' votes can affect the outcome. Multiple methods are in common use for determining the order polyexclusion and distribution of ballots from a loser. Most systems (with the exception of an iterative count) were designed for manual counting processes and can produce different outcomes.\n\nThe general principle that applies to each method is to exclude the candidate that has the lowest tally. Systems must handle ties for the lowest tally. Alternatives include excluding the candidate with the lowest score in the previous round and choosing by lot.\n\nExclusion methods commonly in use:\n\n\n\"Bulk exclusion\" rules can reduce the number of steps required within a count. Bulk exclusion requires the calculation of \"breakpoints\". Any candidates with a tally less than a breakpoint can be included in a bulk exclusion process provided the value of the associated running sum is not greater than the difference between the total value of the highest hopeful's tally and the quota.\n\nTo determine a breakpoint, list in descending order each candidates' tally and calculate the running tally of all candidates' votes that are less than the associated candidates tally.\nThe four types are:\n\n\nQuota breakpoints may not apply with \"optional preferential\" ballots or if more than one seat is open. Candidates above the applied breakpoint should not be included in a bulk exclusion process unless it is an adjacent quota or running breakpoint (See 2007 Tasmanian Senate count example below).\n\nQuota breakpoint (Based on the 2007 Queensland Senate election results just prior to the first exclusion)\nRunning breakpoint (Based on the 2007 Tasmanian Senate election results just prior to the first exclusion)\n\n"}

She left the cast of \"Home and Away\" the following year and went on to appear in nine episodes of \"All Saints\" as Jodi Horner between 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn September 2001, on the set of the Australian film \"The Nugget\" in which she co-starred as Cheryl with Eric Bana, Emmett began to experience intense back pain. Further tests revealed that the cancer had spread to her bones.\n\nIn 2002, she told \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" that \"It wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. The little bastards were going to get me. It was a weird sensation, almost an out-of-body experience. I don't think I'll ever be able to explain it.\" In an interview with Charles Wooley on \"60 Minutes\" that same year, she said: \nIn 1998, Emmett released a cover of Michael Jackson's \"Off the Wall\". She also recorded a duet with Marcia Hines, a cover of the James Taylor hit \"Shower the People\" (on which Carly Simon sang backing vocals), which appeared on Hines' 2004 album \"Hinesight – Songs From the Journey\". Emmett's first album, \"So I Am\", was released after her death and debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Charts. It featured 12 songs co-written by Emmett and longtime collaborators Phill Buckle, Andrew Furze and others.\n\nThe album was completed the week following her death by Producer/ Arranger Daniel Denholm. It was recorded at a number of studios including Subterrane Recording Studio. Belinda's ballad \"Less Than Perfect\" was played at her funeral and was released to radio shortly after. Co-written with Andrew Furze, it featured lyrics about accepting a \"less than perfect life\". It was produced by Daniel Denholm and featured Bass by Jackie Orsascky. \"Less Than Perfect\" was also given away as a complimentary CD in the Herald Sun Publication.\n\nOn 29 January 2005, Emmett married comedian and TV personality Rove McManus, at the Mary Immaculate Church in Waverley in the eastern part of Sydney. She walked down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's ballad \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\". The couple had met at the opening of Fox Studios in Sydney in 1999. \"We're kindred spirits\", Emmett told a newspaper at the time. Guests included Marcia Hines, Stephen Curry, Merrick Watts and Peter Helliar. At their reception, the couple danced to Ben Folds' song \"The Luckiest\".\n\nOn 11 November 2006, Emmett died from cancer at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, 6 months before her 33rd birthday. She had been there since reportedly suffering \"stroke-like symptoms\" the previous Monday.\n\nPrime Minister of Australia, John Howard, said he and Mrs Howard were saddened by Emmett's death. \"She fought a very courageous battle against cancer\", Howard said. \"On behalf of Janette and myself, I extend my deepest sympathies to her husband, Rove McManus, and her family and friends.\" Opposition Leader Kim Beazley also passed on his sympathies. \"This is truly sad news which I think will affect all Australians\", Beazley said. \"The tenderness and care in their relationship (Rove and Belinda) through their adversity, I think, has been an inspiration to many, many Australians.\"\n\nEmmett's funeral was held at 11am on 17 November 2006 in Sydney's Mary Immaculate Church, the place where she married Rove McManus 18 months before. She was privately cremated.\n\nAustralian singer/songwriter Delta Goodrem co-wrote the song \"Be Strong\" for Emmett in 2004, after Emmett had been diagnosed with secondary bone cancer.\n\nOn 13 and 14 November 2006, Channel 7 programs \"Home and Away\" and \"All Saints\" each dedicated an episode to Emmett. The message in the closing credits read \"In memory of our friend, Belinda Emmett 1974 – 2006\". It also had information for people to donate money for breast cancer research. On 17 November 2006, \"Home and Away\" included a special montage of scenes featuring Emmett in her role as Rebecca Fisher/Nash. It was followed by a black screen showing the same memorial message as well as information about donating to The McGrath Foundation. ABC program \"Spicks & Specks\" also displayed a memorial note at the conclusion of an episode aired on 15 November 2006.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, Belinda Emmett's family released one of her songs, \"Less Than Perfect\", on Odeo. The track, from a solo album she was working on at the time of her death, was also played at her funeral. One month later, Emmett's younger brother Shane performed One Sweet Day at the annual \"Carols in the Domain\" in tribute to his sister, who regularly appeared at the event between 1995 and 2002.\n\nIn a newspaper interview published on 1 April 2007 promoting his return to television, Rove McManus revealed that Emmett's solo album had been completed. The title track, \"So I Am\", was issued as a single the next day, with the album following on 28 April 2007. Profits from Hooch Records, the company Emmett formed with McManus to release the album, will go to the McGrath Foundation to support breastcare nurses.\n\nIn July 2007, ABC-TV aired the episode \"Some Meaning in this Life\" of the documentary series \"Australian Story\" which paid tribute to Emmett and her struggle with cancer. Her co-star in \"The Nugget\" Eric Bana introduced the episode which featured contributions from Emmett's family and Rove McManus. The episode won the award for most outstanding public affairs report at the 2008 Logie Awards.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Chasers War on Everything\", Andrew Hansen sang a satirical eulogy about glorifying public figures after their deaths. After a few examples, Hansen pretends to start a verse about Emmett before being signalled to stop by other Chaser members and the entire audience.\n\nOn 11 November 2007, a year after Emmett's death, her husband Rove McManus dedicated his weekly show \"Rove\", to the memory of Belinda Emmett.\n\nOn 20 May 2008 one of Emmett's songs, \"Beautiful Thing\", was included in Olivia Newton-John's new CD \"A Celebration in Song: Olivia Newton-John and Friends\". This CD was created to help raise funds for Olivia's wellness centre in Melbourne, Australia. It consists of a number of duets with Australian and international guest artists which are meant to inspire people touched by cancer. Belinda's song was extracted from her \"So I Am\" CD and the track is 'dedicated with love' to her.\n\n"}

In North America, the company sells coffee directly to consumers via home delivery and through big box stores such as Wal-Mart. Gevalia discontinued sales of tea in 2015. Customers order from a customer service center and a website that was relaunched in August 2009. In North America, Gevalia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kraft Heinz based in Chicago, Illinois. Gevalia produces more than 40 different varieties of coffee and tea.\n\nLocated in Gävle, Sweden (\"Gevalia\" in Latin), Gevalia was introduced in 1853 in Sweden by the trading company Victor Theodore Engwall & Co KB. Jacob Engwall was CEO from 1963 to 1972. After 120 years as a family company, it was sold in 1971 to Mondelēz International predecessor company, General Foods. Most Gevalia coffee is sold in Sweden, Denmark and in the Baltic area, but some is exported to America. Gevalia owes a large part of its current success in Northern Europe to a well-known and long-running marketing campaign with the theme of \"unexpected visitors\", starting in the early 1990s. The campaign featured in addition to print ads and movie commercials also installations in public places in Sweden featuring submarines and airplanes.\n\nGevalia began North American sales, via mail-order delivery service, in 1983. Gevalia is perhaps most well known for its introductory offer of a free coffeemaker and other coffee-related incentives. These offers were seen in magazine advertisements, direct mailings, and television commercials, but were later overtaken by online advertising. Some of these Gevalia.com advertisements were the basis of the 2005 Hypertouch based lawsuit. In September 2013, Gevalia Introduced specialty drink K-Cups using real milk.\n\nIn 2011, Kraft announced the retail launch of Gevalia in the United States; the in-store collection started with a complete line of ground, whole bean, decaf and flavored options.\n\nA mainstream supermarket brand in Northern Europe, Gevalia is marketed in the United States as a premium brand. Gevalia holds the royal warrant of appointment for coffee roasters from the King of Sweden. Gevalia also maintains an Office Coffee Service, offering mail-order coffee by the case, as well as coffee singles.\n\nGevalia is also sold for the Tassimo and K-Cup systems in the United States.\n\nAs of February 2007, Gevalia offered more than 40 different coffees and teas, according to Gevalia.com. The majority of these coffees are Arabica blends, using beans from Kenya, Guatemala, Colombia, and Costa Rica. Gevalia Kaffe is composed of up to six different varieties of these Arabica beans, as well as Brazilian beans.\n\nIn 2005, Kraft was sued by Hypertouch, an ISP, for spamming its Gevalia coffee brand. Kraft was accused of sending multiple waves of junk advertisement to the ISP's customers, the action brought under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 act. The parties resolved their dispute by mutual agreement and the litigation has been dismissed.\n\nOn 9 February 2012, the T discs used in Gevalia, Maxwell House and Nabob brand espresso were recalled from the market following the potential of second degree burn hazard.\n"}
{"id": "1899271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899271", "title": "Indo-Uralic languages", "text": "Indo-Uralic languages\n\nIndo-Uralic is a controversial hypothetical language family consisting of Indo-European and Uralic.\n\nA genetic relationship between Indo-European and Uralic was first proposed by the Danish linguist Vilhelm Thomsen in 1869 (Pedersen 1931:336) but was received with little enthusiasm. Since then, the predominant opinion in the linguistic community has remained that the evidence for such a relationship is insufficient. However, quite a few prominent linguists have always taken the contrary view (e.g. Henry Sweet, Holger Pedersen, Björn Collinder, Warren Cowgill, Jochem Schindler, Eugene Helimski and Gert Klingenschmitt). The hypothetical genetic relation between Indo-European and Uralic is rejected by most linguists and not supported by historic migrations.\n\nThere are two distinct questions here (cf. Greenberg 2005:325):\n\n\nAt the same time, most of the supporters of a relationship between Indo-European and Uralic have also supported their relationship to additional language families, leading some to regard Indo-Uralic as a subset of the larger Nostratic hypothesis.\n\nThis article focuses on the first question, genetic relationship, and only treats incidentally the second question, possible relation to other language families.\n\nThe Dutch linguist Frederik Kortlandt supports a model of Indo-Uralic in which the original Indo-Uralic speakers lived north of the Caspian Sea, and the Proto-Indo-European speakers began as a group that branched off westward from there to come into geographic proximity with the Northwest Caucasian languages, absorbing a Northwest Caucasian lexical blending before moving farther westward to a region north of the Black Sea where their language settled into canonical Proto-Indo-European (2002:1). Allan Bomhard suggests a similar schema in \"Indo-European and the Nostratic Hypothesis\" (1996). Alternatively, the common protolanguage may have been located north of the Black Sea, with Proto-Uralic moving northwards with the climatic improvement of post-glacial times.\n\nAn authoritative if brief and sketchy history of early Indo-Uralic studies can be found in Holger Pedersen's \"Linguistic Science in the Nineteenth Century\" (1931:336-338). Although Vilhelm Thomsen first raised the possibility of a connection between Indo-European and Finno-Ugric in 1869 (336), \"he did not pursue the subject very far\" (337). The next important statement in this area was that of Nikolai Anderson in 1879. However, Pedersen reports, the value of Anderson’s work was \"impaired by its many errors\" (337). The great English phonetician Henry Sweet argued for kinship between Indo-European and Finno-Ugric in his semi-popular book \"The History of Language\" in 1900 (see especially Sweet 1900:112-121). Sweet's treatment awakened \"[g]reat interest\" in the question, but \"his space was too limited to permit of actual proof\" (Pedersen 1931:337). A somewhat longer study by K. B. Wiklund appeared in 1906 and another by H. Paasonen in 1908 (i.e. 1907) (ib.). Pedersen considered that these two studies sufficed to settle the question and that, after them, \"it seems unnecessary to doubt the relationship further\" (ib.).\n\nSweet considered the relationship to be securely established, stating (1900:120; \"Aryan\" = Indo-European, \"Ugrian\" = Finno-Ugric):\n\nBjörn Collinder, author of the \"Comparative Grammar of the Uralic Languages\" (1960), a standard work in the field of Uralic studies, argued for the kinship of Uralic and Indo-European (1934, 1954, 1965).\n\nAlwin Kloekhorst, author of the \"Etymological Dictionary of the Hittite Inherited Lexicon\", endorses the Indo-Uralic grouping (2008b). He argues that, when features differ between the Anatolian languages (including Hittite) and the other Indo-European languages, comparisons with Uralic can help to establish which group has the more archaic forms (2008b: 88) and that, conversely, the success of such comparisons helps to establish the Indo-Uralic thesis (2008b: 94). For example, in Anatolian the nominative singular of the second person pronoun comes from *\"ti(H)\", whereas in the non-Anatolian languages it comes from *\"tu(H)\"; in Proto-Uralic it was *\"ti\", which agrees with evidence from internal reconstruction that Anatolian has the more archaic form (2008b: 93).\n\nThe most extensive attempt to establish sound correspondences between Indo-European and Uralic to date is that of the late Slovenian linguist Bojan Čop. It was published as a series of articles in various academic journals from 1970 to 1989 under the collective title \"Indouralica\". The topics to be covered by each article were sketched out at the beginning of \"Indouralica II\". Of the projected 18 articles only 11 appeared. These articles have not been collected into a single volume and thereby remain difficult to access.\n\nAmong the sound correspondences which Čop did assert were (1972:162):\n\n\nThe history of early opposition to the Indo-Uralic hypothesis does not appear to have been written. It is clear from the statements of supporters such as Sweet that they were facing considerable opposition and that the general climate of opinion was against them, except perhaps in Scandinavia.\n\nKároly Rédei, editor of the etymological dictionary of the Uralic languages (1986a), rejected the idea of a genetic relationship between Uralic and Indo-European, arguing that the lexical items shared by Uralic and Indo-European were due to borrowing from Indo-European into Proto-Uralic (1986b).\n\nPerhaps the best-known critique of recent times is that of Jorma Koivulehto, issued in a series of carefully formulated articles. Koivulehto’s central contention, agreeing with Rédei's views, is that all of the lexical items claimed to be Indo-Uralic can be explained as loans from Indo-European into Uralic (see below for examples).\n\nThe linguists Christian Carpelan, Asko Parpola and Petteri Koskikallio suggest that early Indo-European and Uralic stand in early contact and suggest that any similarities between them are explained through early language contact and borrowings.\n\nAccording to Angela Marcantonio (2014) and Johan Schalin a genetic relation between Uralic and Indo-European is very unlikely and mostly all similarities are explained through borrowings and chance resemblances.\n\nThe most common arguments in favour of a relationship between Indo-European and Uralic are based on seemingly common elements of morphology, such as the pronominal roots (\"*m-\" for first person; \"*t-\" for second person; \"*i-\" for third person), case markings (accusative \"*-m\"; ablative/partitive \"*-ta\"), interrogative/relative pronouns (\"*kʷ-\" \"who?, which?\"; \"*y-\" \"who, which\" to signal relative clauses) and a common SOV word order. Other, less obvious correspondences are suggested, such as the Indo-European plural marker \"*-es\" (or \"*-s\" in the accusative plural \"*) and its Uralic counterpart \"*-t\". This same word-final assibilation of \"*-t\" to \"*-s\" may also be present in Indo-European second-person singular \"*-s\" in comparison with Uralic second-person singular \"*-t\". Compare, within Indo-European itself, \"*-s\" second-person singular injunctive, \"*-si\" second-person singular present indicative, \"*-tHa\" second-person singular perfect, \"*-te\" second-person plural present indicative, \"*tu\" \"you\" (singular) nominative, \"*tei\" \"to you\" (singular) enclitic pronoun. These forms suggest that the underlying second-person marker in Indo-European may be \"*t\" and that the \"*u\" found in forms such as \"*tu\" was originally an affixal particle.\n\nSimilarities have long been noted between the verb conjugation systems of Uralic languages (e.g. that of Finnish) and Indo-European languages (e.g. those of Latin, Russian, and Lithuanian). Although it would not be uncommon for a language to borrow heavily from the vocabulary of another language (as in the cases of English from French, Persian from Arabic, and Korean from Chinese), it would be extremely unusual for a language to borrow its basic system of verb conjugation from another. Supporters of the existence of Indo-Uralic have thus used morphological arguments to support the Indo-Uralic thesis by, for example, arguing that Finnish verb conjugations and pronouns are much more closely related to Indo-European than they would be expected to be by chance; and since borrowing basic grammar is rare, that this would suggest a common origin with Indo-European. (Finnish is preferred for this argument over Saami or Hungarian because it seems to be more conservative, i.e. to have diverged less than the others have from Proto-Uralic. But even then, similar suspicious parallels have been noted between Hungarian and Armenian verb conjugation.)\n\nGiven that the morphemes involved are short and the comparisons generally concern only a single phoneme, the probability of accidental resemblances seems uncomfortably high. The strongly divergent sound systems of Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic are an aggravating factor both in the morphological and the lexical realm, making it additionally difficult to judge resemblances and interpret them as either borrowings, possible cognates or chance resemblances.\n\nA second type of evidence advanced in favor of an Indo-Uralic family is lexical. Numerous words in Indo-European and Uralic resemble each other (see list below). The problem is to weed out cognates due to borrowing. Uralic languages have been in contact with a succession of Indo-European languages for millennia. As a result, many words have been borrowed between them, most often from Indo-European languages into Uralic ones.\n\nAn example of a Uralic word that cannot be original is Finno-Ugric *\"śata\" \"hundred\". The Proto-Indo-European form of this word was *\"ḱm̥tóm\" (compare Latin \"centum\"), which became *\"ćatám\" in early Indo-Iranian (reanalyzed as the neuter nominative–accusative singular of an \"a\" stem > Sanskrit \"śatá-\", Avestan \"sata-\"). This is evidence that the word was borrowed into Finno-Ugric from Indo-Iranian or Indo-Aryan. This borrowing may have occurred in the region north of the Pontic-Caspian steppes around 2100–1800 BC, the approximate floruit of Indo-Iranian (Anthony 2007:371–411). It provides linguistic evidence for the geographical location of these languages around that time, agreeing with archeological evidence that Indo-European speakers were present in the Pontic-Caspian steppes by around 4500 BCE (the Kurgan hypothesis) and that Uralic speakers may have been established in the Pit-Comb Ware culture to their north in the fifth millennium BCE (Carpelan & Parpola 2001:79).\n\nAnother ancient borrowing is Finno-Ugric \"*porćas\" \"piglet\". This word corresponds closely in form to the Proto-Indo-European word reconstructed as \"*porḱos\", attested by such forms as Latin \"porcus\" \"hog\", Old English \"fearh\" (> English \"farrow\" \"young pig\"), Lithuanian \"par̃šas\" \"piglet, castrated boar\", Kurdish \"purs\" \"pig\", and Saka \"pāsa\" (< \"*pārsa\") \"pig\". In the Indo-European word, *\"-os\" (> Finno-Ugric *\"-as\") is a masculine nominative singular ending, but it is quite meaningless in Uralic languages. This shows that the whole word was borrowed as a unit and is not part of the original Uralic vocabulary. (Further details on \"*porćas\" are given in the Appendix.)\n\nOne of the most famous borrowings is the Finnish word \"kuningas\" \"king\" (< Proto-Finnic \"*kuningas\"), which was borrowed from Proto-Germanic \"*kuningaz\". Finnish has been very conservative in retaining the basic structure of the borrowed word, nearly preserving the nominative singular case marker reconstructed for Proto-Germanic masculine 'a'-stems. Furthermore, the Proto-Germanic \"*-az\" ending corresponds exactly to the \"*-os\" ending reconstructable for Proto-Indo-European masculine \"o\"-stems.\n\nThus, *\"śata\" cannot be Indo-Uralic on account of its phonology, while *\"porćas\" and *\"kuningas\" cannot be Indo-Uralic on account of their morphology.\n\nSuch words as those for \"hundred\", \"pig\", and \"king\" have something in common: they represent \"cultural vocabulary\" as opposed to \"basic vocabulary\". They are likely to have been acquired along with a more complex number system and the domestic pig from the more advanced Indo-Europeans to the south. Similarly, the Indo-Europeans themselves had acquired such words and cultural items from peoples to their south or west, including possibly their words for \"ox\", \"*gʷou-\" (compare English \"cow\") and \"grain\", \"*bʰars-\" (compare English \"barley\"). In contrast, basic vocabulary – words such as \"me\", \"hand\", \"water\", and \"be\" – is much less readily borrowed between languages. If Indo-European and Uralic are genetically related, they should show agreements in basic vocabulary, with more agreements if they are closely related, fewer if they are less closely related.\n\nAdvocates of a genetic relation between Indo-European and Uralic maintain that the borrowings can be filtered out by application of phonological and morphological analysis and that a core of vocabulary common to Indo-European and Uralic remains. As examples they advance such comparisons as Proto-Uralic *' (or *') : Proto-Indo-European *', oblique stem *', both meaning 'water', and Proto-Uralic *' (or *') : Proto-Indo-European *', both meaning 'name'. In contrast to *' and *', the phonology of these words shows no sound changes from Indo-European daughter languages such as Indo-Iranian. In contrast to *' and *\"\", they show no morphological affixes from Indo-European that are absent in Uralic. According to advocates of the Indo-Uralic hypothesis, the resulting core of common vocabulary can only be explained by the hypothesis of common origin.\n\nIt has been countered that nothing prevents this common vocabulary from having been borrowed from Proto-Indo-European into Proto-Uralic.\n\nFor the old loans, as well as uncontroversial ones from Proto-Baltic and Proto-Germanic, it is more the rule than the exception that only the stem is borrowed, without any case-endings. Proto-Uralic \"*nimi-\" has been explained according to sound laws governing substitutions in borrowings (Koivulehto 1999), on the assumption that the original was a zero-grade oblique stem PIE \"*(H)nmen-\" as attested in later Balto-Slavic \"*inmen-\" and Proto-Celtic \"*anmen-\". Proto-Uralic \"*weti-\" could be a loan from the PIE oblique \"e\"-grade form for 'water' or from an indirectly attested cognate root noun \"*wed-\". Proto-Uralic \"*toHį-\" 'give' and PFU \"*wetä-\" 'lead' also make perfect phonologic sense as borrowings.\n\nThe number systems of Indo-European and Uralic show no commonalities. Moreover, while the numbers in all Indo-European languages can be traced back to reconstructed Proto-Indo-European numbers, this cannot be done for the Uralic numbers, where only \"two\" and \"five\" are common to all of the family (roots for 3-6 are common to all subgroups other than Samoyedic, and slightly less widespread roots are known for 1 and 10). This would appear to show that if Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic are to be related, the connection must lie so far back that the families developed their number systems independently and did not inherit them from their purported common ancestor. Although, the fact that Uralic languages themselves do not share the same numbers across all Uralic branches indicates that they would not with Indo-European languages in any case, even if they were in fact related.\n\nIt is also objected that some or all of the common vocabulary items claimed are false cognates – words whose resemblance is merely coincidental, like English \"bad\" and Persian \"bad\".\n\n\"Notes for the table\"\n\n\"*\": Greek \"téo\" (Homeric), Avestan \"čahmāi\" (dative singular; \"ča\" < PIE \"*), etc.\n\n\"*\": Latin \"quod\", Old Latin \"quoius\" > Latin \"cuius\" (genitive singular), Old English \"hwæt\" > English \"what\", etc.\n\nThis word belongs to the \"r\" / \"n\" stems, a small group of neuter nouns, from an archaic stratum of Indo-European, that alternate \"-er\" (or \"-or\") in the nominative and accusative with \"-en\" in the other cases. Some languages have leveled the paradigm to one or the other, e.g. English to the \"r\", Old Norse to the \"n\" form.\n\nSome researchers have interpreted Proto-Uralic \"*wete\" as a borrowing from Indo-European that may have replaced a native Proto-Uralic synonym \"*śäčä\" everywhere but in some of the northern fringes of the family (most prominently Proto-Samic \"*čācē\").\n\nIndo-Europeanists are divided on whether to reconstruct this word as \"*nom(e)n-\" or as \"*\", with a preceding \"laryngeal\". See Delamarre 2003:50 for a summary of views, with references. The \"o\" timbre of the root is assured by, among others, Greek \"ónoma\" and Latin \"nōmen\" (with secondary vowel lengthening). As roots with inherent \"o\" are uncommon in Indo-European, most roots having \"e\" as their vowel, the underlying root is probably \"*nem-\". The \"-(e)n\" is an affixal particle. Whether the \"e\" placed in parentheses is inherently part of the word is disputed but probable.\n\nThe \"ḷ\" in Indo-European \"*pḷlu-\" represents a vocalic \"l\", a sound found in English in for instance \"little\", where it corresponds to the \"-le\", and \"metal\", where it corresponds to the \"-al\". An earlier form of the Indo-European word was probably \"*pelu-\".\n\nAn asterisk (*) indicates reconstructed forms.\n\nA tilde (~) means 'alternating with'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Afterwards, he purchased the stock of Cleveland, Sterling & Co., on the corner of Water and Superior streets, where the National Bank buildings now stand, and associated with himself as business partner of Mr. William Bingham. In 1841, Mr. Bingham sold out his interest.\n\nA few years later, Mr. Worthington associated himself with his cousin Mr. James Barnett and Mr. Edward Bingham. In around 1862, Mr. Worthington projected the Cleveland Iron and Nail Works in connection with Mr. William Bingham. Shortly afterwards, they built works for the manufacturing of a gas pipe.\n\nOn the passage of the National Bank Law, Mr. Worthington, with other capitalists, organized the First National Bank of Cleveland. The bank was incorporated in 1863, and at the first meeting of the stockholders, held in June of that year, he was chosen as one of the directors and elected president of the bank.\n\nIn 1865, Worthington was among the Cleveland businessmen who organized the Hahnemann Life Insurance Company (named for German physician Samuel Hahnemann), the first such firm in the U.S. to offer to insure those whose medical belief and practice were exclusively homeopathic, at lower rates than those subjecting themselves to traditional medical treatment; as some contemporary evidence showed a lower rate of mortality under the former. Worthington was also a director of the Ohio Savings and Loan Bank, for some years a director of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati & Indianapolis Railway Company, and was president of the Cleveland Iron Mining Company. He was also one of the pioneers in the development of the iron interests of Cleveland.\n\nThe George Worthington Co. constantly required relocation to larger facilities. In 1882, the hardware-wholesale-turned industrial supply company moved into its last building on 820 St. Clair Avenue. Designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Cuddell and Richardson, The George Worthington Building is noted as a \"highly decorative brick structure, notable for its unusually wide window bays grouped in two multi-story arched ranks, a brick cornice, recessed spandrels and finials.\" Having fallen into disrepair in the later half of the 20th century, the George Worthington Building was rehabilitated as modern loft apartments in 1996 on what is today Worthington Square, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well as being a Cleveland landmark.\n\nWorthington also did much in the way of building up the city, especially in the business portions, and owned at one point 14 buildings in what is today the Historic Warehouse District.\n\nGeorge Worthington is interred in the Worthington Mausoleum at the Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland.\n\n"}

The Football Association of Malaysia headquarters is located at Wisma FAM.\n\nFootball arrived in Malaya with the British. The locals soon picked up the game, and before long it was the country's leading sport. Towards the end of the 19th century, football was one of the central pillars of most sports clubs in Malaya. But it was not structured. Even when the Selangor Amateur Football League took shape in 1905 – which ensured proper administration and organisation – the competition was confined only to clubs in the Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn 1921, the battleship HMS Malaya visited the country. After engaging local opposition in football and rugby, the officers and men of HMS Malaya decided to commemorate the matches by presenting trophies for annual competitions in both rugby and football in Malaya. A national tournament featuring all the states that made up Malaya was started. The competition, known as the Malaya Cup (later renamed the Malaysia Cup in 1963), has been continuously since then, except during the war years.\n\nIn 1926 the Selangor Amateur Football League was established, and in 1936 the Football Association of Selangor was formed and this association soon started organising tournaments and this inspired other states in Malaya to follow suit. Along the same year in 1926, the Football Associations of Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca and the Singapore Amateur Football Association, came together to form the Malayan Football Association (MFA), in order to field a Malayan team against an Australia side that visited Singapore that year.\n\nIn 1933, the MFA was revived to form the Football Association of Malaya (FAM). Initially, the FAM was based in Singapore. It was chiefly responsible for the running of the Malaya Cup competition. The annual tournament played along inter-state lines was a huge success.\n\nThe first president of FAM was Sir Andrew Caldecott followed by M.B. Shelley, Dr. J.S. Webster, S.D. Scott, R. Williamson and Adrian Clark, who served up until 1940 before Europe went on a full-scale war with Germany. In 1940, control of the FAM moved from Singapore to Malaya, with A.R. Singham becoming the first Asian secretary in 1941.\n\nThe FAM's first president after the war was J. E King, to be followed by H.P Byson, and then Dr. C Rawson, who served for two years before vacating for the first ever non-British personality to take over the helm.\n\nIn 1951, Tunku Abdul Rahman (who was to become the first Prime Minister of Malaysia) became the FAM president. It was under Tunku Abdul Rahman that football in Malaysia entered its next phase, with the FAM taking a much bigger role than just being the backbone in the organisation of the Malaysia Cup.\n\nThe FAM was inducted as one of 14 founding members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1956, before becoming a full-fledged member of FIFA two years later.\nTunku Abdul Rahman's love for the game was the main catalyst which resulted in the construction of the Merdeka Stadium and in 1957 it became hallowed ground for all Malaysians when it was the venue chosen to announce Malaysia's independence from Britain.\n\nIt also signalled the birth of the Merdeka Tournament (Pestabola Merdeka), that was to all intents and purposes the centre piece of the independence celebrations.\n\nThe Merdeka Tournament proved to be a huge success, inspiring similar tournaments like the Jakarta Anniversary tournament, the King's Cup in Thailand and President's Cup in South Korea. The inaugural tournament then the premier football competition in Asia was won by Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, Malaya won the title three years in a row, in 1958 and in 1959, and sharing it with South Korea in 1960. The country qualified for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\n\nFollowing the change in name to the Football Association of Malaysia in the early 1960s, Tunku Abdul Rahman continued to play a big role in the development of the game through various youth competitions.\n\nFollowing his departure in 1974, the reins of the FAM was taken over by Malaysia's second Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, who served for just one year. The post was then filled by Tan Sri Datuk Seri Setia Raja Hamzah Haji Abu Samah in 1976, who was the Minister for Trade and Industry at the time.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1984, various football activities were introduced under Tan Sri Datuk Seri Raja Hamzah, and Malaysian football reached a new height in the international arena following his appointment as the AFC president.\n\nThe FAM entered a new era of modernisation and professionalism when the Sultan of Pahang, Haji Ahmad Shah took over.\n\nThe sultan was integral in the growth of football in the new era with the introduction of the semi-pro league in 1989 before the game went fully professional several years later. However, success on the football field for the national team was not forthcoming.\n\nAmong the high points in Malaysian football was the successful hosting of the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, as well as the organisation of the Premier League, which has been called the Malaysia League (M-League) since 2004. Among the low points the National teams suffered defeats never seen before at international stage.\n\nDuring the glory days of Malaysian football in the 1970s and 80s, names like Mokhtar Dahari, Santokh Singh and Soh Chin Aun would strike fear in teams all over Asia.\n\nState Football Association is the governing body of football for the states in Malaysia. The state FAs are responsible for co-ordinating football league and developing football in their region and also made up the structure of FAM as the official governing body of football in Malaysia.\n\nThere are 20 Football Associations affiliated to the FAM. Besides the 14 FAs with regional location, six others are affiliated units.\n\nThe State Associations have their own constitution and structure. During the early amateur era of Malaysian football, most of the state FAs was made up of small organisation with only some bigger states have an active football league while the smaller FAs will send a team to compete in Malaya Cup.\n\nDepending on the size of the state, the State Associations have district associations affiliated to them. Clubs are directly affiliated to the State Football Association alongside District Football Association.\n\nEach State conducts its own competitions. Competitions are at state level where the winners will have a chances to be nominated by their state FAs for promotion to Malaysia FAM League. There are also inter-district competitions such as Liga Bolasepak Rakyat.\n\nThe Football Association of Malaysia formerly runs all top football competitions in Malaysia before some of it was given to Football Malaysia LLP (FMLLP) as one of a privatisation effort for a professional football in Malaysia.

He went to Tokyo to start training in Animal Hamaguchi's gym. Otani's life was hard at the beginning, since he was homeless and his money only paid for a small tatami-like dwelling for 24,000 yen. However, thanks to Hamaguchi, Otani found himself working in a liquor store, where he gained a lot of money that paid his debts, and got him a better place to live, and at the same time he was training for his upcoming debut. He debuted in June 25, 1992 against Hiroyoshi Yamamoto. Like every young lion, he lost almost all of his matches, picking up victories over fellow young lions, such as future tag team partner Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Tokimitsu Ishizawa and Yuji Nagata. By 1995, he was already in the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship picture, and also aiding New Japan against UWF-i alongside Nagata, Ishizawa, Takaiwa, Koji Kanemoto, Black Cat and Takashi Iizuka. A little bit later, Otani became the first WCW World Cruiserweight Champion, defeating Wild Pegasus in a tournament final to be crowned champion on March 20, 1996. This was the start of his push as a legitimate junior heavyweight contender. Over the years, Otani earned the J-Crown and was also part of the first IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions with Tatsuhito Takaiwa in 1999, having legendary feuds with Jyushin Thunder Liger, El Samurai, his own partner Kanemoto, Minoru Tanaka and many others. Also around that time, he started associating himself with Shinya Hashimoto, his future business partner.\n\nIn 2000, New Japan booker Riki Choshu, eager to push his protégé Kensuke Sasaki above everyone else, downgraded the junior heavyweight members to mere jobbers for the heavyweights. Otani protested and was sent abroad to bulk up. Returning in 2001 as a full-fledged heavyweight, Otani challenged Sasaki for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but failed.\n\nHe then joined Shinya Hashimoto in creating their own promotion, Pro Wrestling Zero1, where he became one of the top stars after Hashimoto's departure in 2004 and subsequent death. During the company's relaunch following Hashimoto's death it was renamed to Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX. In ZERO1 he formed a tag team with Masato Tanaka called Emblem; Team Emblem (as they were later known) would appear in the US promotion Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and include Keiji Sakoda. This tag team has formed, disbanded, and reformed numerous times during Otani's time in ZERO1. EMBLEM would go on to win the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (ZERO1's top Tag Team Title Belt) two times. (Otani has held that title 4 times) Otani has won ZERO1's annual round-robin tournament the Fire Festival three separate times (2001, 2002, 2005). On January 22, 2006, Otani defeated Steve Corino for the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. On December 24, 2007 it was announced by ZERO1's parent company FIRST ON STAGE that Otani would become the President of ZERO1. Otani took office officially on January 23, 2007, replacing previous President Yoshiyuki Nakamura who became Director of FIRST ON STAGE. He defeated Yuji Nagata on February 27, 2009, to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Otani made a special return to New Japan, when he replaced an injured Daichi Hashimoto in a tag team match, where he and Keiji Mutoh were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima.\n\nBeginning in September 2015, Otani downgraded himself back to the junior heavyweight division, proclaiming that the division had \"lost its way\" and \"needed more heart\". On September 23, he reformed his junior heavyweight team with Tatsuhito Takaiwa and defeated NWA International Lightweight Tag Team Champions Takuya Sugawara and Brother Yasshi to win the titles, the team's fourth tag team title overall and their first in 15 years. On October 11 Otani defeated Minoru Tanaka (who had defeated him and Takaiwa in 2000, along with Koji Kanemoto, to end their second IWGP junior tag reign) to win both the Zero1 International and NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championships. After three successful defenses, he lost the titles to Kotaro Suzuki on February 3, 2017.\n\n\n"}

Based on the 1898 novella \"The Turn of the Screw\" by the American novelist Henry James, the screenplay was adapted by William Archibald and Truman Capote, who used Archibald's own stage play—also titled \"The Innocents\"—as a primary source text. Its plot follows a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the children are being possessed.\n\nArchibald's original screenplay for \"The Innocents\" was based on the premise that the paranormal events depicted were legitimate. Displeased with Archibald's take on the material, director Jack Clayton appointed American writer Truman Capote to rework the script. Capote's rewrites incorporated psychological themes, resulting in a final work that suggests other alternatives to the plot. Filming took place partly on location at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in Sussex, with additional shoots occurring at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Shot in CinemaScope, \"The Innocents\" incorporated bold minimal lighting as well as deep focus, employed by cinematographer Freddie Francis to achieve a distinctive—and sometimes claustrophobic—atmosphere. The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sound created by Daphne Oram. Clayton was dissatisfied with the original score of the movie by French composer Georges Auric and requested some alteration. But because Auric was not available due to health problems, Clayton had to turn to W. Lambert Williamson.\n\n\"The Innocents\" received international distribution from the American film studio 20th Century Fox, and received its London premiere on 24 November 1961. It was released in the United States the following month on 15 December in Los Angeles and Christmas Day in New York City. The psychological underpinnings of the film's screenplay have resulted in it being the subject of numerous critical and scholarly essays, particularly in the area of film theory. Of the various film adaptations of James's work, \"The Innocents\" has received the most critical debate. It was selected by \"The Guardian\" as one of the 25 best horror films ever made.\n\nMiss Giddens applies for her first job as a governess. The wealthy bachelor interviewing her is unconcerned with her lack of experience. He values his freedom to travel and socialise and unabashedly confesses that he has \"no room, mentally or emotionally\" for his niece and nephew. They were orphaned and left in his care as infants, and he keeps them at Bly, his large country estate. The previous governess, Mary Jessel, had died suddenly less than a year ago. All he cares about is that Miss Giddens accepts full responsibility for the children, never troubling him with whatever problems may arise.\n\nAt Bly, Miss Giddens is instantly taken with Flora, the niece. She also forges a friendship with Mrs. Grose, the kindly housekeeper. The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, but soon returns to Bly after being expelled from school for being a \"bad influence\" on his peers. Mrs. Grose says she cannot imagine Miles misbehaving, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too thinks his teachers must have exaggerated. He seems charming and mature – though perhaps too mature, with flirtatious flattery toward his governess.\n\nMiss Giddens soon grows disturbed by the children's occasional odd behaviours and secretiveness, and is bothered by disembodied voices and apparitions of a man and woman she witnesses in the house, whom Mrs. Grose identifies, from their descriptions, as Miss Jessel and Peter Quint, another deceased employee of the children's uncle. Mrs. Grose also reluctantly reveals that the two were in a relationship prior to their deaths. Miss Giddens concludes that the ghosts of Quint and Miss Jessel possess the bodies of the children so they can physically continue their relationship. She is determined to rescue them from this possession.\n\nOne night, while left alone with Miles, Miss Giddens presses him to talk about the ghosts, and about why he was expelled from school. Initially, Miles is glib and evasive, but he eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with violence and vulgar language. Miss Giddens enjoins him to say who taught him this language and behaviour. Miles suddenly begins yelling obscene insults and laughing maniacally, and Quint's face appears in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then runs outside; Miss Giddens follows, begging him to \"say his name.\" Quint appears on a hedge nearby, but Miles does not appear to see him. He finally shouts Quint's name, and Quint appears. Miles grows still and falls to the ground. Miss Giddens cradles him and assures him that he is free. She then realises that Miles is dead. Sobbing, she leans over him and kisses him on the lips.\n\n\n\"The Innocents\" has received attention from academics and specialists in film theory, beginning with the literary theorist Edmund Wilson, who wrote extensively on the film's source novella, insisting that the supernatural phenomena were in fact the product of Miss Giddens' own sexual repression. According to literary scholar Leonard Orr, of the many adaptations of James's work, \"The Innocents\" has received the largest amount of critical attention.\n\nFilm scholar David J. Hogan reiterated the film's underlying themes of sexual repression becoming the focus of supernatural activity, and compared elements of the film to Robert Wise's \"The Haunting\" (1963), based on \"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson. Hogan also interprets the film's final scene as \"a perverse variation on the \"Sleeping Beauty\" story, as Kerr symbolically liberates the boy from a presumed possession with a kiss after he has fainted.\"\n\nIn the book \"Fifty Classic British Films, 1932-1982: A Pictorial Record\" (2013), film writer Anthony Slide noted: \"Through the use of shadows, oblique camera angles, and an atmospheric soundtrack, Jack Clayton not only captured the horror of James's story, but also its deeper sadness—the children's isolation from the real world, the governess' problematic sexuality, and the curiously pitiful nature of the former governess, Miss Jessel.\"\n\nThe original screenplay for \"The Innocents\" was adapted by playwright William Archibald from his 1950 play of the same name, which itself was based on Henry James's novella \"The Turn of the Screw\". In both his stage and screen adaptations, Archibald wrote under the assumption that the supernatural experiences of Miss Giddens were real, and that the ghosts she encountered were legitimate entities as opposed to figments of her imagination (a possibility left unresolved in James's original work). Archibald's interpretation of the source material was made clear in a denouement in the original draft of the script, which:\n\nDirector Jack Clayton envisioned a more ambiguous conclusion for the film: \"My original interest in the story was in the fact that one could tell it from a completely different point of view,\" he said. \"In other words–evil was alive in the mind of the governess and in fact she more or less creates the situation. Now this was long before I read the notes on Henry James and found that somebody else also imagines that Henry James wrote it this way—sort of almost Freudian hallucinations the governess had.\"\n\nClayton was ultimately unhappy with Archibald's screenplay due to their conflicting interpretations of the material, and asked American writer Truman Capote (whom he had met while working on \"Beat the Devil\") to rework Archibald's script. At the time, Capote was in the middle of writing \"In Cold Blood\"; however, because he was a fan of the James novella, he agreed, and took a three-week hiatus to rewrite the screenplay. Capote introduced the Freudian symbolism that is prominently highlighted in the relationships and visual compositions of the film, with implications that the supernatural phenomena experienced by Miss Giddens is a result of her own sexual repression and paranoias rather than legitimate paranormal experiences. Clayton later brought in writer John Mortimer to give the dialogue a \"Victorian\" polish. Clayton intended to maintain a sense of claustrophobia and, at the same time, open up the play, which took place entirely in the drawing room of the house. Clayton saw the house as one of the characters in the film and used it as such to highlight certain scenes.\n\nCultural critic Christopher Frayling attributes approximately 90% of the film's script as it appears on the screen to Capote (The final credits attribute the screenplay to Archibald and Capote, with Mortimer receiving credit for \"Additional Scenes and Dialogue\"). Frayling also notes a Southern Gothic feel present in Capote's script alterations – particularly with the governess's repressed erotic sensibility counterpointed by shots of lush and decaying plants and rapacious insect life. Director Clayton, though, chose to downplay this aspect in the finished film, to preserve the ambiguity between the ghost story and Freudian element.\n\nAn unreliable narrator was originally intended to feature in the narrative and the film was to open with a funeral scene. There are stills of the scene that circulated at the time, but Clayton ultimately elected to open the film with darkness, a song sung by a little girl, and the image of Kerr's hands that are clasped in prayer, with her rosary between her fingers, as she murmurs and sobs. Gradually Kerr's face is highlighted. According to film scholar Frayling, the opening scene creates a sense of intimacy and, perhaps, trust that the governess should be trusted, but the use of darkness surrounding her suggests that it is possible that the story that follows could be nothing more than in her own mind – isolated and creating its own supernatural world.\n\nDeborah Kerr was cast in the lead role of Miss Giddens at the counsel of the film's studio and distributor, 20th Century Fox, despite the fact that the governess character in James's original work was twenty years old (Kerr was forty at the time). On discussing the part with Clayton, Kerr recalled: \"I remember asking Jack what he wanted me to stress in playing the part, and he replied, \"You play it the way you feel, but don't forget the ambiguity!\" So I tried the very nervous tight-rope between sanity and insanity, and left the audience to exercise its intelligence.\" Kerr's role in the film is significant, as she appears onscreen in approximately 95 minutes of the film's 99 minute runtime. She was paid US$400,000 for her work in the film.\n\nFor the roles of the children, Clayton cast eleven-year-old Pamela Franklin (in her film debut) as Flora, and Martin Stephens as her brother, Miles; Stephens had featured in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer horror film \"Village of the Damned\" (1960). Australian-born actress Clytie Jessop was cast as the spectral Miss Jessel (also in her film debut), while Peter Wyngarde was cast in the role of Quint, Miss Jessel's illicit lover. Though he receives top billing, Michael Redgrave appears only in the beginning of the film in a cameo role as the children's uncle.\n\nClayton wanted the film to be quite different from the Hammer horror films of the period, and employed a number of cinematic devices to achieve this end, including using genuinely eerie sound effects and moody, stylised lighting. For the first 45 seconds of the film, the screen is black and singing is heard, and only after this do the credits appear. Clayton, who had previously made films associated with the British New Wave, took on the project specifically to avoid being typecast as a New Wave director, and to work in a different genre.\n\nFilming of \"The Innocents\" took place primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Interior sequences were shot on sound stages at Shepperton, as well as the sequences which took place in the greenhouse veranda; a façade for Bly house was also built by the art department on the studio lot. On-location exterior scenes were shot at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in East Sussex. To ensure that his child actors' performances remained uninhibited, Clayton withheld the full details of the story from Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin, who only received those parts of the script that lacked the surprising and mysterious adult elements of the film. According to script supervisor Pamela Mann, star Deborah Kerr was specifically attuned to making sure the children \"had fun on set\". Writer Truman Capote was present during the first several weeks of filming, writing additional dialogue for Stephens and Franklin, and making minor script alterations.\n\n20th Century Fox insisted that \"The Innocents\" be shot in CinemaScope, while Clayton wanted to shoot it in standard academy ratio, feeling that he would be unable to make use of the additional space on both sides of the frame. Cinematographer Freddie Francis insisted that he could work with the CinemaScope aspect ratio, having shot \"Sons and Lovers\" (1960) for director Jack Cardiff in the format. Francis won the Oscar for Best Cinematographer for his work on the earlier film. He used colour filters and used the lighting rig to create darkness consuming everything at the edge of the frame. As the shoot progressed, Clayton found uses for the edges of the screen and began composing for the CinemaScope format. Francis used deep focus and narrowly aimed the lighting towards the centre of the screen. It was so bright on set in that area that actress Kerr arrived to the set wearing sunglasses one day. Francis and Clayton framed the film in an unusually bold style, with characters prominent at the edge of the frame and their faces at the centre in profile in some sequences, which, again, created both a sense of intimacy and unease, based on the lack of balance in the image. For many of the interior night scenes, Francis painted the sides of the lenses with black paint to allow for a more intense, \"elegiac\" focus, and used candles custom-made with four to five wicks twined together to produce more light.\n\nDuring principal photography, Clayton and editor Jim Clark—whom he had hired on the recommendation of his colleague Jimmy Ware, editor of Clayton's first feature, \"Room At The Top\"—would meet each evening and view the footage shot that day, assembling daily rough cuts as they progressed; this allowed Clayton to make adjustments and shoot pick-ups along the way, giving him closer supervision during the filming process.\n\nIn his 2010 memoir \"Dream Repairman\", Jim Clark recalled his work as editor on \"The Innocents\" as \"a true collaboration\" and that he and Clayton became close friends and regular drinking partners during production, since both were single at the time, and lived near each other. He described \"The Innocents\" as \"a real pleasure to edit, since Jack had a very certain approach to his material, having worked out everything beforehand. He was a perfectionist who left nothing to chance, and was very precise in his approach to work.\"\n\nInspired by George Stevens' \"A Place in the Sun\", Clark crafted numerous dissolves and superimpositions, which he also described as \"mini montages\", in which he edited the cross-fades between certain scenes to run four or five times longer than the standard \"mix\", and often blended in a third, near-subliminal image; film scholar Anthony Slide would later refer to the film's use of dissolves as \"obsessive\". Clark achieved this process by using blank film rolls as a template on which he would manually assign Clayton's film negatives with hand-marked reel numbers, slate numbers, and time stamps indicating the duration each image should remain within a single frame. Clayton explained in later interviews that he felt the dissolves entirely appropriate and in accordance with his vision of the film as \"mood-oriented\", adding: \"It gave me opportunities to explore this field, which I had never done before: to create in those multiple dissolves images which hang there, and have a meaning which applies both to the end of the last scene and the beginning of the next.\"\n\nClayton maintained close supervision over the editing of the film, specifically making sure that no single scene ran too long; because of the film's small cast, Clayton worried that \"if [the film] sags, we've got no other characters to go to\". According to Clark, Clayton went through \"a lot of anguish\" over the final scene, in which Miles dies in Miss Giddens' arms, and that the director was \"quite prone to agonizing over scenes if he was uncertain of them, and we would run them over and over again, hardly changing a frame, until he felt reconciled to the sequence.\" Clayton felt the climactic scene should be \"claustrophobic and played very close—developing into violence and savagery\". Clark also revealed that, despite their previously harmonious working relationship, he unexpectedly fell out with Clayton just before the film was released, and felt that he had allowed himself to become too close to his director. Clark recalled that on the evening of the pre-release critics' screening, Clayton went into a rage because, through no fault of her own, his personal assistant Jeanie Sims was late in phoning him with the critics' reactions. When Sims called Clark to Clayton's office the next day, he discovered that Clayton had completely smashed a large plaster scale model of Bly House, and was refusing to speak to either of them. In spite of this rift, Clark and Clayton gradually repaired their friendship, and Clayton subsequently invited Clark to edit his next film, \"The Pumpkin Eater\".\n\nThe original score for \"The Innocents\" was composed by Georges Auric, who had scored several films Clayton had been involved with in the past, such as \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952) and \"The Bespoke Overcoat\" (1956). Clayton was dissatisfied with Auric's final score for \"The Innocents\", and requested he make alterations; however, Auric was unable to do so because of his ailing health, and re-orchestration was completed by W. Lambert Williamson. The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sounds created by Daphne Oram. These \"spectral massed sine tones\" were incorporated into the film's sound design, though Oram was not credited for them.\n\n\"O Willow Waly\" – the song from the film by Auric and Paul Dehn; sung on the soundtrack by Isla Cameron – was released in the United Kingdom on a Decca single in March 1962. It was covered by The Kingston Trio on their 1962 album \"Something Special\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the original classification in 1961 given by the British Board of Film Censors (now the British Board of Film Classification or BBFC) had been the \"X\" rating, which meant that no person under the age of 16 years would be allowed into the cinema to see it.\n\n\"The Innocents\" had its world premiere at the Carlton Theatre in London on 24 November 1961. In North America, 20th Century Fox devised a marketing campaign that branded the film a \"strange new experience in shock\". The film premiered in the United States at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 15 December 1961, and opened in New York City on 25 December 1961, screening at the Criterion Theatre and 72nd Street Playhouse. The film grossed a total of $1.2 million in the North American territories of the United States and Canada.\n\nBosley Crowther wrote an unfavourable review of the film in \"The New York Times\" when the film was first shown in New York City in December 1961: \"But we fear that old hands long familiar with the traffic and tricks of horror films will feel a bit bored by this screen version of Henry James' famous tale, \"The Turn of the Screw\", so mild and ingenuous it is alongside others of the genre. And especially do we fear they will be let down by the lucent performance of Deborah Kerr as the supposedly morbid young woman who is the focal figure in the tale\".\n\nA review published in \"Time\" magazine praised Kerr's performance and the film's \"dangerous, intelligent darkness\", but criticized the screenplay, suggesting that Archibald and Capote's script \"unhappily press[es] hard, much harder than James did, for the psychiatric interpretation. They have obviously failed to perceive that in suggesting a normal, everyday basis for supernatural phenomena, they must inevitably relieve the spectator of his nameless horror of what might happen. But isn't horror, when all's said and done, the one important experience this tale is intended to communicate?\" In a \"Variety\" review, the film was deemed a \"high-quality spine-chilling drama\". In the summer 1962 issue of \"Film Quarterly\", Pauline Kael called the film \"the best ghost movie I have ever seen\", praising Stephens' performance as well as Capote's adaptation of the source material. Boyd Martin of \"The Courier-Journal\" praised the film as a \"spooky chiller...  the hypnotic influence is there, and audiences will, I suspect, feel what the governess feels.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for two BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film and Best Film. For his direction, Clayton was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Best Director. William Archibald and Truman Capote won a 1962 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. The film was entered into the 1962 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"The Innocents\" received distribution on DVD in the United States through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on September 6, 2005. This release also features a spanish audio track. The Criterion Collection released a new edition of the film on DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2014. This release features a new 4K transfer, an introduction and audio commentary with cultural critic Christopher Frayling, an interview with cinematographer John Bailey (discussing the work of Freddie Francis), and a 2006 documentary on the making of the film. In the United Kingdom, the film received a Blu-ray release on 23 August 2010 through BFI. Applications for certification since 2000 have led to the film being rated as a \"12\" or \"12A\".\n\n\"The Innocents\" is regarded as a classic psychological horror film. With the British cinematic re-release of \"The Innocents\" as part of the BFI's Gothic Season in December 2013, the film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from contemporary critics. \"The Innocents\" holds a 94% \"fresh\" rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 50 reviews. Its consensus reads, \"Creepily atmospheric, \"The Innocents\" is a stylishly crafted, chilling British ghost tale with Deborah Kerr at her finest\".\n\nPeter Bradshaw, film critic for \"The Guardian\", gave the film five out of five stars in December 2013, praising it as an \"elegant, sinister and scalp-prickling ghost story\". Tim Robey, writing for \"The Telegraph\", also gave the film five out of five stars, recognising the \"immaculate\" directorial ability of Jack Clayton, and commending the \"eerie, coldly beautiful\" adaptation of James' novel.\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin in 2009 awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it a \"first-rate thriller\". Director Martin Scorsese placed \"The Innocents\" on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Similarly, Andrew Pulver placed the film at number 11 in \"The Guardian's\" list of the best horror films of all time. \"Time Out\" named it as the 18th in a list of the 100 greatest British films.\n\n\"The Infant Kiss\", a song by Kate Bush, from her 1980 album \"Never for Ever\", was inspired by the film. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro cites the film as an influence on his 2015 gothic horror film \"Crimson Peak\".\n\nOn January 4, 2017 Martin Stephens gave an extensive interview on his career as a child actor during a TEDx episode titled 'Movies, Marriage and Meditation'.\n\n\n\n"}

They comprise a set of integrated and coordinated policies and interventions with concise goals, specific targets and a defined time frame, aimed at preventing and eliminating a country’s WFCL. They emphasize the need to address the root causes of child labour, linking action for the latter’s elimination to national development policy, macro-economic trends and strategies, and demographic and labour market processes and outcomes, with particular emphasis on economic and social policies to combat poverty and to promote universal basic education and social mobilization. The TBP’s time horizon is set in accordance with the prevalence of the WFCL, the availability of resources, the level of local expertise and other conditions prevailing in the country.\n\nFocusing heavily on the rapid elimination of the worst forms of child labour, the TBP approach represents a logical progression of IPEC’s work to date while drawing on the experience that has been accumulating since the programme’s inception. TBPs pull together many of the successful approaches piloted by IPEC and others in the past into a comprehensive and scaled-up programme combining upstream policy-oriented interventions covering awareness raising, legislation and enforcement, education, employment and social protection with withdrawal and rehabilitation interventions. IPEC sees the TBP as a key strategic approach for attaining large-scale impact on the WFCL.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1899316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899316", "title": "Lenny Lane", "text": "Lenny Lane\n\nLeonard \"Lenny\" Carlson (born October 16, 1970) is an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name Lenny Lane. He is best known for his time with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1995 to 2000, where he held the Cruiserweight Championship once.\n\nCarlson was trained by Eddie Sharkey and debuted in 1995. He first appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Lane Carlson, a jobber. He made his WCW debut on the April 14, 1997 episode of \"Monday Nitro\" by losing to the World Television Champion Ultimo Dragon. He later changed his ring name to Lenny Lane on the May 24 episode of \"Saturday Night\" during a match against Buff Bagwell, which Carlson lost. He began to wear boots marked \"LL\", possibly due to his resemblance to Lex Luger in his early days despite his smaller size. He made his pay-per-view debut at the 1998 Slamboree event as a participant in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Cruiserweight Championship. He was eliminated by Juventud Guerrera. His first storyline saw him as Chris Jericho's lackey. He later began advertising a (fictional) product known as \"Ab Solution Plus.\" It was a health drug that supposedly benefited the abdominal muscles. Lane picked up his first victory in WCW on the October 3 episode of \"Saturday Night\" against Lash LeRoux. He appeared in the World War 3 battle royal at the eponymous pay-per-view on November 22 for a future shot at the World Heavyweight Championship and Kevin Nash won the match.\n\nIn June 1999 he approached Lodi and stated \"They're not doing much with me and they're not doing much with you. Why don't we form a tag team?\" Lane had been inspired by a \"Saturday Night Live\" vignette featuring \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\". WCW management were initially reluctant, but booker Kevin Nash approved the idea, and Lane and Lodi were renamed The West Hollywood Blondes (as opposed to the Hollywood Blonds, \"Stunning\" Steve Austin and Brian Pillman). The Blondes were implied to be homosexuals, wearing pink trunks emblazoned with large pink triangles (a symbol of the gay community) and with Lane sporting pigtails, facial glitter and a lollipop. Controversially, the Blondes were later revealed to be brothers. The Blondes were an effective villainous tag team, though they rarely won matches.\n\nIn an upset victory, Lane defeated Rey Mysterio, Jr. on the August 19 episode of \"WCW Thunder\" in Lubbock, Texas to win the World Cruiserweight Championship. With the assistance of Lodi, he defended the title successfully including notably against Shaggy 2 Dope of the Insane Clown Posse over the next six weeks. On the October 3 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", Psychosis was announced as having defeated Lane for the World Cruiserweight Championship at an unspecified live event. Lane had already been set to drop the title to Disco Inferno that night, but WCW management was worried about a possible incident. Lane did not appear that night and Psychosis defended and lost the title to Disco instead.\n\nThe Blondes were taken off television in the same month following protests from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, who threatened to organize a boycott of WCW, claiming that \"the character of Lenny is presented with the intention to incite the crowd to the most base homophobic behavior\" and \"the audience's reaction [to Lenny Lane and Lodi being physically attacked by other wrestlers] gives permission to viewers to do harm to gay people in a very literal way.\"\n\nLane and Lodi returned as \"Standards and Practices\", a censorious duo who opposed the \"adult themes\" present in WCW. In a drastic departure from their previous appearance, they wore designer suits, carried briefcases and were accompanied by a secretary, Miss Hancock. Standards and Practices was supposedly an attempt to mock the conservative views of WCW management, and was not unlike the Right to Censor faction the WWF would have shortly afterwards due to complaints from the Parents Television Council over their programming. Miss Hancock eventually abandoned the team. Soon the gimmick of Standards and Practices were dropped on an edition of WCW Nitro when both Lane and Lodi stripped off their suit and tie. In the following weeks, they competed under the tag team name 2XS, a gimmick more resembling two hard rock party goers who wore just jeans to the ring and came out to theme music resembling something from Van Halen. Announcers also began calling Lodi \"\"Idol\"\" (his name backwards) during the matches. This gimmick too was short lived as they failed to get over, even in a tag team title match and were soon pulled off TV a few weeks later. Both Lane and Lodi were released from WCW in August 2000. Lane briefly reappeared for a short feud with The Wall, but was released once more.\n\nLenny Lane moved on to Texas Championship Wrestling, in April 2001, where he formed a tag team with Shane Helms, winning the TCW Tag Team Championships. The team was split when Helms was signed by the World Wrestling Federation. He also appeared on The AWA Stars Tour wrestling in the upper Midwest with Jim Brunzell, Buck \"Rock n' Roll\" Zumhofe, Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissy, Mantaur, and others. The Blondes reunited in the now defunct World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in late 2001. Lane was signed by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (Lodi would have been signed too, but he was injured) and debuted on June 19, 2002. Lane formed a short-lived tag team with Bruce known as The Rainbow Express and competed on the second-ever TNA pay-per-view on June 26. Lane sustained an injury, however, and the team split on November 20, 2002 after Bruce turned on Lane. He left TNA soon after.\n\nLane competed for Steel Domain Wrestling throughout 2003, and for the New Age Wrestling Alliance in 2004 and early 2005. He also works for the American Wrestling League, which is in the same TV slot and wrestles in the same venues as Steel Domain Wrestling did.\n\nLenny Lane currently owns and wrestles for Prime Time Wrestling, an independent wrestling promotion out of Bloomington, Minnesota. He main evented the first show in September defeating Mitch Paradise. In January 2012, Lenny Lane defeated Chiropractor DC to become the first PTW Champion. He would later lose it to him in May. In September, Lenny Lane would defeat Renny D to become the only two-time PTW champion but would lose it to Black Stallion on the same night. In May 2013, Lane defeated Ariya Daivari to become the only three-time PTW Champion. In December of that year a match would take place between John Johnson and Renny D which Renny D would win. Lenny Lane would then award the PTW Championship to Renny D making him a two-time champion.\n\nLane appeared on the October 31, 2004 edition of \"WWE Heat\" teaming with Ken Anderson against Rob Conway and Sylvain Grenier and on the September 30, 2008 edition of WWE's \"ECW on Sci Fi\", losing a squash match to Jack Swagger.\n\n"}

Formed in 1937, the federation was one of founding members of the Asian Football Confederation, the overseer of football in Asia.\n\nThe AIFF sanctions and runs all competitive football tournaments and leagues at a national level, namely the Indian Super League, I-League and Super Cup. The federation also indirectly manages local football competitions through the state associations. The federation is also responsible for managing the India national football team, as well as the women's team and the various youth national sides.\n\nThe AIFF is also part of the South Asian Football Federation, the organization that runs football in South Asia. The federation is currently based in Dwarka, Delhi.\n\nPrior to the formation of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the \"de facto\" ruling body for association football in India were the Indian Football Association (IFA). The IFA was founded in 1893 and ran the game in the Bengal region. The federation was mainly governed by Englishmen and served as the most powerful football body in the country during the early 20th century.\n\nEfforts to form a countrywide football federation were started in 1935 by the IFA when the federation, as well as seven other associations, met at a conference but no consensus could be reached. After differences in opinions and other conflicts were resolved, a meeting was conducted in March 1937 which would serve to be the beginning of the start of the AIFF. The AIFF was officially founded on 23 June 1937 after representatives from six regional football associations met at the Army Headquarters in Shimla. Namely, the six regional football associations were the IFA, Army Sports Control Board, United Provinces, the North West India Football Association, the Bihar Football Association, and Delhi.\n\nAfter the launch of the national football federation, the idea of an India national football team did not gain much momentum until after India gain independence in 1947. Select Indian teams did participate in tours of Australia, Burma, Afghanistan, and South Africa but none were officially part of the national team. In 1948, one year after independence and 11 since forming as a football association, the AIFF gained affiliation with FIFA, the governing body for football around the world. Later that year, the national team was officially formed and participated in their first official tournament, the 1948 Summer Olympics. \nIn 1950, the national team automatically qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup which was to be held in Brazil after all the teams in India's qualification group withdrew. However, prior to the tournament, India themselves withdrew from the World Cup with the AIFF citing the reason as due to lack of funding. Other reasons given for India's withdrawal included the players playing mainly barefooted and that the AIFF valued the Summer Olympics tournament more than the FIFA World Cup at the time. In 1952, during the Olympics in Finland, India were defeated in the first round by Yugoslavia 10–1. This defeat made the AIFF make it mandatory for players on the national team to wear football boots. In 1954, the AIFF played an active role in promoting football in Asia when they were one of the founding members of the Asian Football Confederation. India took part in four straight Olympic football tournaments between 1948 and 1960 but have failed to qualify since.

{"id": "1899322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899322", "title": "Sicilian School", "text": "Sicilian School\n\nThe Sicilian School was a small community of Sicilian and mainland Italian poets gathered around Frederick II, most of them belonging to his imperial court. Headed by Giacomo da Lentini, they produced more than three-hundred poems of courtly love between 1230 and 1266, the experiment being continued after Frederick's death by his son, Manfred.\n\nThese poets drew inspiration from the troubadour poetry of Occitania written in langue d'oc, which applied the feudal code of honor to the relation between a man (acting as the vassal) and a woman (acting as king or superior). This is a reversal of the traditional role of women, traditionally dependent on men, and marks a new awareness in medieval society: the decadence of feudalism with the increasing power of the middle class, causes a shift in the reading public, the epic (traditionally devoted to great military pursuits) gradually giving way to the lyric (generally focused on love). In the lower Middle Ages more and more women were reading books than ever before and poetry tried to adapt to their point of view and their newly acquired role in society. \n\nThis features French poetry, then very influential in Italy. What distinguishes the Sicilian School from the troubadours, however, is the introduction of a kinder, gentler type of woman than that found in their French models; one who was nearer to Dante's madonnas and Petrarch's Laura, though much less characterised psychologically. The poems of the Sicilians hardly portray real women or situations (Frederick's song cannot be read as autobiographical), but the style and language are remarkable, since the Sicilians (as Dante called them) created the first Italian literary standard by enriching the existing vernacular base, probably inspired by popular love songs, with new words of Latin and Provençal origin.\n\n\"It is lyric poetry to be in the forefront of literature, inspiring a widespread enthusiasm \nwhose effects will be felt for centuries. The initial boost given by the Sicilian poets from the Svevs' court, the first to use a standardised vernacular to make art poetry will be passed on to many others: and all of them, not just the pedantic imitators of the Siculo-Tuscan school (such as Bonagiunta Orbicciani) but also Guinizzelli, the poets of Dolce Stil Novo and more widely all writers of verse, will have to deal, though by different degrees, with the Sicilian models, so that some peculiarities will be assimilated into standard usage of Italian poetry.\" (Bruno Migliorini, \"Storia della letteratura italiana\")\n\nThough yet confined to a few notaries and dignitaries of the emperors, such poetry shows for the first time uniform linguistic traits and a richness in vocabulary far exceeding that of the Sicilian language by which it was inspired. The \"Magna curia\" was not based in any given city, but always moving across Southern Italy, a fact which helped the school avoid the temptation of choosing any local dialect as the starting point for their new language. That is why the new standard was a Koiné language, a melting pot of many different vernaculars.\n\nThe reason for moving from city to city was mainly political. Although his experiment was short-lived, Frederic successfully created the first modern state in Europe, run by an efficient bureaucracy: its members were neither appointed from the aristocracy nor the clergy with good reason, since the former were far more interested in defending their own privileges than the welfare of the country and often plotted against him in the hope of regaining their power, while the latter were basically faithful to the Pope, his biggest enemy.\n\nFrederic was in fact dismantling the feudal system of government inherited from the Normans, his \"magna curia\" and minor dignitaries were usually chosen from lay orders (like his poet-notaries). He also abolished internal barriers: free trade brought prosperity to the South, making Bari (as witnessed by Cielo in his \"Contrasto\") one of the richest cities in the Mediterranean. But, keeping this modern state afloat, meant that his barons had no power to collect taxes, their greatest source of revenues. Hence the necessity for Frederick to bring law and order by moving his court to and fro.\n\nThough the Sicilian School is generally considered conventional in theme or content it rather \"stands out for his refined lexicon, near to the style of \"trobar clus\" and for the wise treatment of figures of speech and metaphors of \"stylnovistic taste\" taken from natural philosophy\" (Cesare Segre). There is a visible move towards neoplatonic models, which will be embraced by Dolce Stil Novo in the later 13th century Bologna and Florence, and more markedly by Petrarch. Unlike the Northern Italian troubadours, no line is ever written in Occitan. Rather, the Occitan repertoire of chivalry terms is adapted to the Siculo-Italian phonetics and morphology, so that new Italian words are actually coined, some adapted, but none really loaned. A most famous specimen is \"Io m'aggio posto in core\" by Giacomo da Lentini, who apparently inspired the movement. Giacomo da Lentini is also widely credited by scholars (as Francesco Bruni, Cesare Segre et al.) for inventing the sonnet, a literary form later perfected by Dante and, most of all, Petrarch. He uses it in a number of poems. We quote here the most famous that probably inspired the whole school:\n\nThe main inhibiting factor on Sicilian poetry was probably the political censorship imposed by Frederick: literary debate was confined to courtly love. In this respect, the poetry of the north, though stuck to the langues d'oïl, provided fresher blood for satire. The north was fragmented into communes or little city-states which had a relatively democratic self-government, and that is precisely why the \"sirventese\" genre, and later, Dante's \"Divina Commedia\" and sonnets were so popular: they referred to real people and feelings, though often idealised like Beatrice. A sirventese is, in effect, eminently political: it usually refers to real battles and attacks real military or political enemies, the author often being the soldier or the knight involved in the strife, as in Guittone d'Arezzo's \"Rotta di Montaperti\" (Defeat of Montaperti), a bloody battle where Manfred of Sicily, Frederick's son, defeated the guelfs. Dante himself will commemorate the event in the Commedia many years later, where, mindful of the political strife that had him exiled, he will attack many princes and popes, such as Boniface VIII, one of his biggest personal enemies.\n\nFrederick's censorship is also apparent from the structure of the song: the Sicilians transformed the \"tornada\", the strophe which in troubadour poetry contains a dedication to a famous person with a \"congedo\", where the poet bids goodbye to his reader and asks the song to bear his message to his lady. The re-shaping of the Occitan model also involved the suppression of music. The authors were great readers and translators, but apparently could not play any instrument, so their work was intended for reading, which called for logical unity, posing a question, proposing, and finding a solution in the end.\n\nThat meant no interchangeable lines as in troubadour poetry and fewer repetitions: for a French \"jongleur\" who sang his poems these were necessary, but they sounded redundant to the Sicilian authors. Their poetry was music to the eye, not to the ear, and their legacy is also apparent in Dante and Petrarch's lyrics. The sonnet is even more exacting on this point: the separation between the octave and the sestet is purely a logical one, the rimes drawing a visual line between the first and last part. However, the fact that Italian poetry was being made for the reading public may have facilitated its circulation.\n\nThough lyric poetry prevailed at Frederick's (and later Manfredi's) court, it is at this time that we have an interesting exception in \"Rosa fresca aulentissima\" (transl: \"Fresh very perfumed rose\"), widely known as \"Contrasto\" and attributed to Cielo d'Alcamo (also known as \"Ciullu di Vincenzullu\"), about which modern critics have much exercised themselves. This \"Contrasto\" is written in a Sicilian language close to that spoken in the city of Messina, with several influences from continental Italian variants. The subject is a humorous fight between two young lovers, a kind of poetry quite common in the Middle Ages (as \"contrasti\" or \"pastorelle\"). It is about a young suitor who sneaks into the garden of a young lady from a rich Sicilian family and secretly declares his love to her. He then tries to seduce the girl with his one-liners; she berates him for his \"ill\" intentions and keeps him at bay to protect her honor, but her prudeness proves eventually to be just a love game: she gives in completely to his bold advances. However, the language uses much of the courtly language of lyric poetry and the result is a parody of the Sicilian School's clichés. The \"Contrasto\" belongs to the time of the emperor Frederick II (it can be dated between 1230 and 1250, but probably closer to the latter), and is also important as a proof that there once existed a popular, independent of literary, poetry prior to Frederick's times. Now most critics agree that the \"Contrasto\" of Cielo d'Alcamo is probably a scholarly re-elaboration of some lost popular song. It is perhaps the closest to a kind of poetry that has perished or which was smothered by the Sicilian literature of Frederick's. Its distinguishing feature was its hilarity and down-to-earthedness as opposed to the abstract verse of the Sicilian School. But it has been argued that its style betrays a profound knowledge of Frederick's movement and some critics have hinted the man who penned it must have been acquainted with or even been part of, the court itself. Given the highly satiric and erotic vein Ciullo d'Alcamo may well be a fictitious name. His \"Contrasto\" shows vigor and freshness in the expression of feelings: Such \"low\" treatment of the love-theme shows that its subject-matter is certainly popular. This poem sounds real and spontaneous, marked as it is by the sensuality characteristic of the people of southern Italy.\n\nThe standard of the Sicilian school combines many traits typical of the Sicilian, Latin, Provençal and to a lesser, but not negligible extent, Apulian and certain southern dialects. Such a melting pot greatly helped the new Italian language: the Provençal suffixes \"-ière\" and \"-ce\", for example, generated hundreds of new Italian words in \"-iera\" and \"-za\" as it. \"riv-iera\" (\"river\") or \"costan-za\" (\"constancy\"). Such affixes would be then adopted by Dante and his contemporaries, and handed on to future generations of Italian writers. Dante's styles \"illustre, cardinale, aulico, curiale\" were partly developed from his close study of the Sicilian School which he quotes widely in his studies, especially in his \"De Vulgari Eloquentia\". The Sicilian school was later re-founded by Guittone d'Arezzo in Tuscany following the death of Manfredi, Frederick's son, so many of these poems were later copied in manuscripts that widely circulated in Florence. This first standard in which they were written, was, however, modified in Tuscany. In fact, Tuscan scriveners perceived the five-vowel system used by southern Italian dialects (i, e, a, o, u) as a seven-vowel one (i, é, è, a, ó, ò, u). As a consequence, the Italian texts may contain lines that no longer rhyme with each other (sic. -i > tusc. -é, sic. -u > tusc. -ó). Tuscans also changed words as \"gloria\" [pron. glòria] to \"ghiora\", \"aju\" [pron. àyu] (\"I have) to \"aggio\" [pron. adjo] etc. Though some original texts have been restored to their original Sicilian, we must see such remakes only as tentative reconstructions of originals that, unfortunately, may have been lost forever. Dante and his contemporaries would take this newborn language a step further, expanding and enriching it with even more words of Latin and Florentine origin, carefully working on the style to create \"volgare illustre\", a higher standard quite close to today's Standard Italian.\n\n\n"}

It also refers to a type of performance dance developed by the Ukrainian diaspora in North America.\n\nIt originated in the eastern Galician (Modern West Ukrainian) town of Kolomyia (Hutsulshchyna). It was historically popular among the Ukrainians and Poles, and is also known in north-eastern Slovenia where in Austro-Hungarian times some Ukrainians settled (as the \"kalamajka\") .\n\nKolomyjkas are still danced in Ukraine, as a tradition on certain holidays, during festivities, or simply for fun. In Ukraine's west, they are popular dances for weddings.\n\nThe Kolomyka can be a combination of tune, song, and dance with some recordings having a line of singing alternating with a line of instrumental melody, whilst others are purely instrumental. The text tends to be in rhyming couplets and is a humorous commentary on everyday life. Its simple 2/4 rhythm and structures make the kolomyka very adaptable, and the text and melodies of thousands of different versions have been annotated. One collection done by Volodymyr Shukhevych in 1905, contains more than 8,000. Although a very old form they continue to be popular due to their fast, energetic and exciting melodies often with syncopation.\n\nHungarian composer Bela Bartok's first concerto for piano and orchestra incorporates a rhythmic and melodic scheme that has a symmetrical structure, combinig two measure units, that move typically in a narrow stepwise motion and often use scalar patterns and note repetitions. In Hungary, this rhythmic type is associated with the swineherd dance that Bartok believed was derived from the Ukrainian kolomyka. Bartok also considered the swineherd songs to be the source of the popular kurucz song repertoire and of the instrumental verbunktos, suggesting that these too were based on Kolomyka melodies-\"The latter (Verunkos), again, seems at least partially a derivation from the so-called Hungarian Sheperd-dance melodies whose source is probably the Ukrainian Kolomyjka dance-melodies\" (Bela Bartok), \"Concerning the origin of the Rumanian (b) 1 and (c) types, let us indicate two alternatives, however, in principle equally possible. They may have originated directly from either the Verbunkos music or the Ukrainian Kolomyjka. The latter alternative is likely because of the comparatively long frontier between Rumanian and Ukrainian linguistic territory.\" (Bela Bartok)\n\nIn North America, the kolomyjka is primarily a social dance. Participants form a circle, joining hands. The dance begins with the participants turning the circle, usually counterclockwise, then clockwise, or by forming a spiral. Further into the dance soloists will perform in the centre of the circle.\n\nAccording to Andriy Nahachewsky, a former professional stage dancer, Director of the Kule Centre for Ukrainian and Canadian Folklore, and Huculak Chair of Ukrainian Culture and Ethnography at the University of Alberta, kolomyjky as practised in Canada are a separate genre of dance from what is known in Ukraine. The diasporic kolomyjka developed from the old country folk dance but with a prevailing influence from stage dancing. Originating in Western Canada in the 1950s and 60s, the kolomyjka is considered the highlight of Ukrainian weddings and dances in Canada: when any attendees who have experience as stage dancers perform their favourite \"tricks\" involving lifts, spins, high kicks, even building human pyramids. It is a chance for individuals and groups to \"show off\" their most impressive or dangerous moves so as to entertain the audience and win approval. Nahachewsky suggests that despite being a relatively new tradition the Canadian kolomyjka is an important symbol of Ukrainian culture in Canada and that the dynamism of this type of Ukrainian dance helps to interest young people in Canada in retaining Ukrainian culture.\n\n\nRelated dances:\n\n"}

Magliabechi became the central figure of literary life in Florence, and scholars of every nation sought his acquaintance and corresponded with him. Whilst this eminent post gave him considerable prominence, he is remembered more for his personal characteristics and his vast store of self-acquired learning. He has been described as a literary glutton, and the most rational of bibliomaniacs, inasmuch as he read everything he bought. His own library consisted of 40,000 books and 10,000 manuscripts. His house literally overflowed with books; the stairways were lined with them, and they even filled the front porch. Many stories are told of his marvellous memory that was \"like wax to receive and marble to retain.\"\n\nIn worldly matters Magliabechi was extremely negligent. Reputedly, he once even forgot to draw his salary for over a year. He wore his clothes until they fell from him, and thought it a great waste of time to undress at night, \"life being so short and books so plentiful\". He welcomed all inquiring scholars, provided they did not disturb him while at work. He had a hearty dislike for Jesuits. The story goes that one day in pointing out the Palazzo Riccardi to a stranger he said, \"Here the new birth of learning took place,\" and then turning to the college of the Jesuits, \"There they have come back to bury it.\"\n\nMagliabecchi died at the age of 81, in 1714, at the monastery of Sta. Maria Novella. He left his books to the Grand Duke to be used as a public library; his fortune went to the poor. His library, known as the \"Magliabechiana\", was combined with the grand-ducal private library by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy in 1861, the two forming the core of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze.\n\nMagliabechi was known as an eccentric. He was a man of a most forbidding and savage aspect, and exceedingly negligent of his person. He refused to be waited upon. His diet was commonly three hard-boiled eggs, with a draught of water. Magliabechi did not care about personal hygiene and slept in his clothes. He had a small window in his door, through which he could see all those who approached him; and if he did not wish for their company, he would not admit them. He spent some hours in each day at the palace library; but is said never in his life to have gone farther from Florence than to Prato, whither he once accompanied Cardinal Henry Norris, librarian at the Vatican, to see a manuscript.\n\n"}
{"id": "1899336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899336", "title": "Cystinosis", "text": "Cystinosis\n\nCystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine. It is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from accumulation of free cystine in lysosomes, eventually leading to intracellular crystal formation throughout the body. Cystinosis is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in the pediatric age group. Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells in renal tubules is impaired, leading to abnormal amounts of carbohydrates and amino acids in the urine, excessive urination, and low blood levels of potassium and phosphates.\n\nCystinosis was the first documented genetic disease belonging to the group of lysosomal storage disease disorders. Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the \"CTNS\" gene that codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal membrane-specific transporter for cystine. Intracellular metabolism of cystine, as it happens with all amino acids, requires its transport across the cell membrane. After degradation of endocytosed protein to cystine within lysosomes, it is normally transported to the cytosol. But if there is a defect in the carrier protein, cystine is accumulated in lysosomes. As cystine is highly insoluble, when its concentration in tissue lysosomes increases, its solubility is immediately exceeded and crystalline precipitates are formed in almost all organs and tissues.\n\nHowever, the progression of the disease is not related to the presence of crystals in target tissues. Although tissue damage might depend on cystine accumulation, the mechanisms of tissue damage are not fully understood. Increased intracellular cystine profoundly disturbs cellular oxidative metabolism and glutathione status, leading to altered mitochondrial energy metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis.\n\nCystinosis is usually treated with cysteamine, which is prescribed to decrease intralysosomal cystine accumulation. However, the discovery of new pathogenic mechanisms and the development of an animal model of the disease may open possibilities for the development of new treatment modalities to improve long-term prognosis.\n\nThere (are) three distinct types of cystinosis each with slightly different symptoms: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. Infants affected by nephropathic cystinosis initially exhibit poor growth and particular kidney problems (sometimes called renal Fanconi syndrome). The kidney problems lead to the loss of important minerals, salts, fluids, and other nutrients. The loss of nutrients not only impairs growth, but may result in soft, bowed bones (hypophosphatemic rickets), especially in the legs. The nutrient imbalances in the body lead to increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood (acidosis). \nBy about age two, cystine crystals may also be present in the cornea. The buildup of these crystals in the eye causes an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Without treatment, children with cystinosis are likely to experience complete kidney failure by about age ten. With treatment this may be delayed into the patients teens or 20s. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in patients include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, impaired sweating, decreased hair and skin pigmentation, diabetes, and thyroid and nervous system problems.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of intermediate cystinosis are the same as nephropathic cystinosis, but they occur at a later age. Intermediate cystinosis typically begins to affect individuals around age twelve to fifteen. Malfunctioning kidneys and corneal crystals are the main initial features of this disorder. If intermediate cystinosis is left untreated, complete kidney failure will occur, but usually not until the late teens to mid twenties.\n\nPeople with non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis do not usually experience growth impairment or kidney malfunction. The only symptom is photophobia due to cystine crystals in the cornea.\n\nCystine crystals are hexagonal in shape and are colorless. They are not found often in alkaline urine due to their high solubility. The colorless crystals can be difficult to distinguish from uric acid crystals which are also hexagonal. Under polarized examination, the crystals are birefringent with a polarization color interference.\n\nCystinosis occurs due to a mutation in the gene CTNS, located on chromosome 17, which codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal cystine transporter. Symptoms are first seen at about 3 to 18 months of age with profound polyuria (excessive urination), followed by poor growth, photophobia, and ultimately kidney failure by age 6 years in the nephropathic form.\n\nAll forms of cystinosis (nephropathic, juvenile and ocular) are autosomal recessive, which means that the trait is located on an autosomal gene, and an individual who inherits two copies of the gene – one from both parents – will have the disorder. There is a 25% risk of having a child with the disorder, when both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive trait.\n\nCystinosis affects approximately 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns. and there are only around 2,000 known individuals with cystinosis in the world. The incidence is higher in the province of Brittany, France, where the disorder affects 1 in 26,000 individuals.\n\nCystinosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes an accumulation of the amino acid cystine within cells, forming crystals that can build up and damage the cells. These crystals negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes.\n\nThe accumulation is caused by abnormal transport of cystine from lysosomes, resulting in a massive intra-lysosomal cystine accumulation in tissues. Via an as yet unknown mechanism, lysosomal cystine appears to amplify and alter apoptosis in such a way that cells die inappropriately, leading to loss of renal epithelial cells. This results in renal Fanconi syndrome, and similar loss in other tissues can account for the short stature, retinopathy, and other features of the disease.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis and treatment monitoring are most often performed through measurement of white blood cell cystine level using tandem mass spectrometry.\n\n\nCystinosis is normally treated with cysteamine, which is available in capsules and in eye drops. People with cystinosis are also often given sodium citrate to treat the blood acidosis, as well as potassium and phosphorus supplements as well as others. If the kidneys become significantly impaired or fail, then treatment must be begun to ensure continued survival, up to and including renal transplantation.\n\nThe related adjective \"cystinotic\" indicates \"relating to, or afflicted with, cystinosis\".\n\n\n"}

Conversion work commenced in 1982 at Preston Workshops, with the drop centre floor raised to give a level floor throughout, and a single entry door provided on one side of the tram. Two saloons were provided either side of a central kitchen and washroom, one saloon seating 12 while the other seats 24 patrons. It was based at the Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) South Melbourne depot.\n\nThe service started on 2 November 1982 (Melbourne Cup day) with the single tram, as amendments were required to the Liquor Licence Act to allow for the service of alcohol on a mobile restaurant. The driver and conductor were provided by the MTA while onboard staff are Colonial Tramcar Restaurant employees. Until 1992, the restaurant had to carry a conductor to comply with tramways union regulations about two-man teams operating all trams (in case the brakes failed). This conductor cost the Colonial Tramcar Restaurant $50,000 per year until former premier Jeff Kennett did away with the need for conductors. One of the conductors was a lady who could be seen knitting throughout the entire service.\n\nTwo 1948 SW6 class trams, 937 and 939, were later added to the fleet in October 1992 and February 1995 respectively. With the closure of South Melbourne depot in February 1997, operation was transferred to Southbank depot. In 2006 the 442 was retired and replaced with a third SW6 class tram 938. In 2011 nos 937 and 939 were withdrawn from service and replaced with 935 and 964. All have distinctive burgundy livery, and can seat 36 passengers each.\n\nThe restaurant, which has one lunch and two dinner sittings each day, advises booking well in advance. The trams are boarded from the Clarendon Street Junction stop near the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. They then run on selected standard tram routes through the city and some nearby inner suburbs, returning to their origin. The ride in the restaurant tram is generally quite steady. Food is prepared offsite in a commercial kitchen and is loaded onto the trams in a raw form. Each tram has its own chef and all of the food is freshly cooked as the tram is moving. The menu provides a limited choice, as does the wine list. However, unlimited alcohol is included in the fixed, prepaid meal price.\n\nOn 11 August 2012, 30 diners and three staff had to be evacuated from one of the restaurant tramcars after it caught fire in East Melbourne.\n\nIn 1985 The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant became the first restaurant in Melbourne to ban smoking.\n\nThe Colonial Tramcar Restaurant is a four-time winner of the coveted National Tourism Award (1984, 1988, 1992, and 1993).

After being utilized as a jobber in a handful of matches on \"Saturday Night\" and \"WorldWide\" throughout 1998 and 1999, Sanders picked up his first victory on the July 19, 2000 episode of \"Thunder\" by defeating Crowbar. Sanders was introduced in mid-2000 as \"Above Average\" Mike Sanders.\n\nOn the August 16 episode of \"Thunder\", Sanders was courted by Disco Inferno to join The Filthy Animals. After accompanying Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Juventud Guerrera for their tag team match against Sean O'Haire and Mark Jindrak, Sanders turned on the Animals and, along with Chuck Palumbo, Shawn Stasiak, and Reno, helped O'Haire and Jindrak attack the Animals and lose the match via disqualification in the process. On the August 21 episode of \"Nitro\", the stable was named The Natural Born Thrillers, with Sanders serving as the stable's mouthpiece. After Sanders was interrupted during a promo by Filthy Animal member Konnan, the Thrillers (Sanders, Jindrak, and O'Haire) subsequently defeated the Animals (Mysterio, Jr., Guerrera, and Disco Inferno) in a six-man tag team match.\n\nThe Thrillers continued their feud with the Animals, with Sanders defeating the Inferno on the August 23 episode of \"Thunder\" and the Thrillers defeating the Animals in an elimination match. On September 17 at Fall Brawl, the Thrillers faced the Animals, Big Vito and their mystery partner (later revealed to be Paul Orndorff) in an elimination match, which ended in a no-contest due to Orndorff suffering a stinger during the match. The Thrillers would then go on to lose a two-on-five handicap match against the Animals on the September 18 episode of \"Nitro\" despite having a numerical advantage, ending the feud between the two stables.\n\nFollowing their feud with the Filthy Animals, the Natural Born Thrillers would go on to lose to The Jung Dragons on the September 20 episode of \"Thunder\". After naming himself the new WCW Commissioner on the September 27 episode of \"Thunder\", the Thrillers gained Kevin Nash as a \"coach\". With Nash, Sanders defeated then-Cruiserweight Champion Elix Skipper in a handicap powerbomb match orchestrated by Sanders on the October 2 episode of \"Nitro\", resulting in Sanders becoming the new Cruiserweight Champion. He then went on to retain the Cruiserweight Title against Lance Storm in his first title defense on the October 4 episode of \"Thunder\". Sanders then entered into a feud with Ernest Miller over the Commissionership, and defeated Miller in a kickboxing match at Halloween Havoc on October 29 to retain his position as Commissioner thanks to interference by Shane Douglas. The Thrillers then ended their alliance with Nash by attacking him during a title match against then-World Heavyweight Champion Booker T, after finding Nash no longer useful due to Sanders being the new Commissioner. The Thrillers then lost to Nash in a handicap match via disqualification on the November 12 episode of \"Nitro\". On November 16 at the Millennium Final pay-per-view, Miller defeated Sanders to become the new WCW Commissioner. After retaining the Cruiserweight Title against Kwee Wee on November 26 at Mayhem, Sanders lost the title to Chavo Guerrero, Jr. on the December 6 episode of \"Thunder\".\n\nOn the December 12 episode of \"Nitro\", Sanders was squashed by Sid, though the Thrillers would manage to defeat The Insiders (Nash and Diamond Dallas Page) in a handicap match later in the night in what turned out to be the Thrillers' final match together.\n\nAt Sin on January 14, 2001, Sanders faced Miller in a rematch for the Commissionership, but was once again defeated. Following this, Sanders teamed with Kwee Wee and lost to the Jung Dragons in a first round match of a tournament to crown the inaugural Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions. On the final episode of \"Thunder\" on March 14, Sanders wrestled his final match for WCW as he and Disqo lost to Konnan and Hugh Morrus in a tag team match.\n\nIn late March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation bought out WCW.\n\nWhen WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation, Sanders' contract was acquired as part of the deal and he was then sent to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), one of the WWF's developmental territories. While there, he was a member of the Team WCW stable along with fellow WCW alumni Johnny The Bull, Reno, Mark Jindrak, Jason Jett, Lash LeRoux, Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, Kwee Wee, Elix Skipper, and Jamie Knoble.\n\nSanders later formed a tag team with Lance Cade called Natural Born Attitudes, and on February 13, 2002, the duo captured the HWA Tag Team Championship belts after defeating Val Venis and Steve Bradley. However, the Tag Team Title was vacated that same day, and Cade defeated Sanders on February 20 to win the title and subsequently named Bradley as his tag team partner.\n\nIn March 2002, Sanders became the head booker of HWA after suffering a foot injury. On June 24, 2002, Sanders wrestled his only match for the now-renamed World Wrestling Entertainment as he and Jason Sugarman defeated B.J. Payne and Steve Bradley in a tag team dark match before \"Sunday Night Heat\". He was released from the company on July 19, 2002.\n\nAfter a brief tour with World Wrestling All-Stars in 2002 as the promotion's Commissioner, Sanders debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on January 15, 2003, where he lost to Jerry Lynn. Sanders then immediately joined Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.), the top heel stable in TNA. On January 22, Sanders picked up his first victory in TNA as he and David Flair defeated Lynn and Ron Killings in a tag team match. After mixed success over the next few months, Sanders challenged Kid Kash for the X Division Championship, but was unable to win the title. On May 21, Sanders entered the Hard 10 Tournament and defeated Brian Lee in the first round. On June 18, Sanders lost to New Jack in the semi-finals. Sanders wrestled his final match for TNA on July 2, where he lost to Shark Boy.\n\nAfter taking a two-year hiatus, Sanders returned to wrestling on February 20, 2005 for Vince Russo's Ring of Glory promotion, where he and Glenn Gilbertti defeated Adam Jacobs and Johnny Swinger. On December 16, Sanders returned to Ring of Glory and wrestled his final match, as he and Erik Watts lost to Gilbertti and D'Lo Brown.\n\nAfter his final match in 2005, Sanders performed his first open mic at The Punchline, a comedy club in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Since then, Sanders has gone on to become a full-time stand-up comedian and improv actor, and has also worked alongside fellow comedians Tommy Davidson, Mark Lundholm, Diana Jordan, Craig Robinson and Vinnie Coppola. He currently performs at clubs and corporate events and gives motivational speeches.\n\nSanders' father runs a towing business. Sanders owns \"Roll Speed Media\", a talent solutions company that represents actors in Atlanta; he also owns \"The Party Paramedic\", a DJ and entertainment company for weddings, parties, corporate events and trade shows.\n\nSanders has been divorced twice; he and his ex-wife DeLana have two children, Kenneth and Alexis.\n\nSanders remains good friends with former WCW creative writer Vince Russo and fellow professional wrestlers Chuck Palumbo, Disco Inferno, Mark Jindrak and Sean O'Haire until O'Haire's death.\n\n\n"}

The club was previously known as the Chicago Spurs of the National Professional Soccer League but were relocated to Kansas City following the merger of the NPSL and the United Soccer Association to form the NASL in 1967. The Spurs won the NASL Championship in 1969 but were dissolved shortly after the 1970 NASL season. The club's colors were red and white.\n\nThe Kansas City Spurs were founded in 1968 following the merger of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and the United Soccer Association (USA) to form the new first division professional league, the North American Soccer League (NASL). The team was relocated from Chicago, IL, where the Chicago Spurs had only played a single season in 1967 in the NPSL before the formation of the new league. The Spurs left for Kansas City to avoid competition with the Chicago Mustangs, who had also joined the NASL from the old USA.\n\nFollowing the 1968 NASL season, the league was in trouble with ten franchises having folded. The 1969 season was split into two halves: The first half was called the International Cup, a double round robin tournament in which the remaining NASL clubs were represented by teams imported from the United Kingdom.

His older brother was the pedagogue, composer, conductor and pianist Eduard Zuckmayer.\n\nBorn in Nackenheim in Rhenish Hesse, he was the second son of Amalie (1869–1954), née Goldschmidt, and (1864–1947). When he was four years old, his family moved to Mainz. With the outbreak of World War I, he (like many other high school students) finished Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium with a facilitated \"emergency\"-\"Abitur\" and volunteered for military service. During the war he served with the German Army's Field Artillery on the Western Front. In 1917, he published first poems in the pacifist journal \"Die Aktion\" and he was one of the signatures of the \"Appeal\" published by the Antinational Socialist Party after the German Revolution of 9 November 1918. By this time Zuckmayer held the rank of a \"Leutnant der Reserve\" (Reserve Officer).\n\nAfter the war, he took up studies at the University of Frankfurt, first in humanities, later in biology and botany. In 1920, he married his childhood friend Annemarie Ganz, but they were divorced just one year later, when Zuckmayer had an affair with actress Annemarie Seidel.\n\nHis first ventures into literature and theatre were complete failures. His first drama \"Kreuzweg\" (1921) fell flat and was delisted after only three performances, and when he was chosen as dramatic adviser at the theatre of Kiel, he lost his new job after his first, controversial staging of Terence's \"The Eunuch\". In 1924 he became dramaturg at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, jointly with Bertolt Brecht. After another failure with his second drama \"Pankraz erwacht oder Die Hinterwäldler\" he finally had a great public success with the rustic comedy \"Der fröhliche Weinberg\" (\"The Merry Vineyard\") in 1925, written in his local Mainz-Frankfurt dialect. This work won him the prestigious Kleist Prize two years after it was awarded to Brecht, and launched his career.\n\nAlso in 1925, he married the Austrian actress Alice Herdan, and they bought a house in Henndorf near Salzburg in Austria. Zuckmayer's next play \"Der Schinderhannes\" was again successful. In 1929, he wrote the script for the movie \"Der blaue Engel\" (starring Marlene Dietrich) based on the novel \"Professor Unrat\" by Heinrich Mann. That year, he was also awarded the Georg Büchner Prize, another prestigious German language literary award.\n\nIn 1931, his play \"Der Hauptmann von Köpenick\" premiered and became another success, but his plays were prohibited when the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 (Zuckmayer's maternal grandfather had been born Jewish and converted to Protestantism). Zuckmayer and his family moved to their house in Austria, where he published a few more works. After the \"Anschluss\", he was expatriated by the Nazi government, and the Zuckmayers fled via Switzerland to the United States in 1939, where he first worked as a script writer in Hollywood before renting Backwoods Farm near Barnard, Vermont in 1941 and working there as a farmer until 1946. In 1943/44 he wrote \"character portraits\" of actors, writers and other artists in Germany for the Office of Strategic Services, evaluating their involvement with the Nazi regime. This became known only in 2002, when the approximately 150 reports were published in Germany under the title \"Geheimreport\". The family's Vermont years are narrated in Alice Herdan Zuckmayer's \"Die Farm in den grünen Bergen\" (\"The Farm in the Green Mountains\"), a best seller in Germany upon its 1949 publication.\n\nIn January 1946, after World War II, Zuckmayer was granted the US citizenship he had applied for already in 1943. He returned to Germany and traveled the country for five months as a US cultural attaché. The resulting report to the War Department was first published in Germany in 2004 (\"Deutschlandbericht\"). His play \"Des Teufels General\" (\"The Devil's General\"; the main character is based on the biography of Ernst Udet), which he had written in Vermont, premiered in Zürich on 14 December 1946. The play became a major success in post-war Germany; one of the first post-war literary attempts to broach the issue of Nazism. It was filmed in 1955 starring Curd Jürgens.\nZuckmayer kept writing: \"Barbara Blomberg\" premiered in Konstanz in 1949 and \"Das kalte Licht\" in Hamburg in 1955. He also wrote the screenplay for \"Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach\", the German-language version of Otto Preminger's 1953 film \"The Moon is Blue\". Having shuttled back and forth between the U.S. and Europe for several years, the Zuckmayers left the U.S. in 1958 and settled in Saas Fee in the Valais in Switzerland. In 1966, he became a Swiss citizen, and he published his memoirs entitled \"Als wär's ein Stück von mir\" (\"A part of myself\"). His last play \"Der Rattenfänger\" (music by Friedrich Cerha) premiered in Zürich in 1975. Zuckmayer died on 18 January 1977 in Visp. His body was interred on 22 January in Saas Fee.\n\nZuckmayer had been granted numerous awards, such as the Goethe Prize of the city of Frankfurt in 1952, the \"Bundesverdienstkreuz mit Stern\" in 1955, the Austrian \"Staatspreis für Literatur\" in 1960, \"Pour le Mérite\" in 1967, and the Austrian \"Verdienstkreuz am Band\" in 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

IPEC's aim is to work towards the progressive elimination of child labour by strengthening national capacities to address child labour problems, and by creating a worldwide movement to combat it.\n\nIPEC’s priority target groups are children in worst forms of child labour such as slavery and practices similar to slavery, such as bonded child labour and children in hazardous working conditions and occupations. IPEC also focuses on children who are particularly vulnerable, i.e. very young working children (below 12 years of age), and working girl children.\n\nThe political will and commitment of individual governments to address child labour in cooperation with employers' and workers' organizations, other non-governmental organizations and relevant parties in society – such as universities and the media – is the starting point for all IPEC action.

Following wartime service in the Royal Air Force Voluntary Reserve, he became the assistant Head of Variety Productions in 1948.\n\nThe British public knew him best for his work with Harry S. Pepper as presenter of the popular \"Monday Night at Eight\" radio magazine programme, which was broadcast every week live. The programme started in 1937 as \"Monday Night at Seven\", becoming \"Monday Night at Eight\" soon after the outbreak of the Second World War. It was broadcast throughout the war and continued for several years after it. Waldman's speciality was \"Puzzle Corner\", with a \"deliberate mistake\" which listeners were invited to spot in time for next week's show.

He studied illustration at the Royal College of Art under Edward Bawden and John Nash. He has worked in watercolour, lithography and wood engraving, at scales ranging from platform-length murals for Charing Cross Underground Station in London to postage stamps and logos.\n\nHis themes include paintings of landscape and environmental posters to drawings of street life and protest placards. He has written and illustrated many books, mostly about countries and cities. He also designed a number of British commemorative postage stamps.\n\nGentleman was born in London and grew up in Hertford, the son of Scottish artists Tom Gentleman and Winifred Gentleman who had met at the Glasgow School of Art. He attended Hertford Grammar School and the St Albans School of Art, did national service as an education sergeant in the Royal Army Education Corps in charge of an art room in Cornwall, and then went to the Royal College of Art. He stayed there as a junior tutor for two years before becoming a freelance artist.\n\nHe has lived and worked in the same house on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town since 1956, and also in Suffolk, travelling only for work. He has four children: a daughter by his first wife Rosalind Dease, a fellow-student at the RCA, and two daughters and a son by his second wife Susan Evans, the daughter of the writer George Ewart Evans. His and Susan's daughter Amelia, a \"Guardian\" journalist, is married to the Conservative politician Jo Johnson.\n\nHis work is represented in Tate Britain, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum.\n\nGentleman paints and draws landscapes, buildings and people, and uses drawing in his design work. Many of his watercolours have been made in London and Suffolk and around Britain, on extended travels in France, Italy and India, and during briefer spells in South Carolina, East Africa, the Pacific and Brazil. He has held many exhibitions of these works. Commissioned series of watercolours have included landscapes for Shell, several Oxford Almanacks for the Oxford University Press, and interiors of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the FCO. His drawings and watercolours have been reproduced on textiles and wallpapers, dinner plates for Wedgwood and on a Covent Garden mug for David Mellor. His architectural drawings have appeared in \"House & Garden, The Sunday Times, New York Magazine\", and on the RIBA's series of Everyday Architecture wallcharts. His most recently published watercolours were made as illustrations for \"In the Country\", 2014. In 2010, Gentleman was commissioned by Dulwich Picture Gallery to create a design for its Christmas Card.\n\nGentleman's early wood engravings were for Penguin paperbacks, greetings cards, wine lists, press ads, and books – \"Swiss Family Robinson\" and John Clare's \"The Shepherd's Calendar\". He engraved a series of 32 covers for the New Penguin Shakespeare series. His wood engravings appear on many of his stamps, and in a 100-metre-long mural, his most widely seen public work. In 1978, London Transport commissioned the platform-length Eleanor Cross murals on the underground at Charing Cross station. It shows, as in a strip cartoon, how the medieval workforce built the original cross, from quarrying the stone to setting in place the topmost pinnacle. Its wood-engraved images of stonemasons and sculptors, enlarged twenty times to life-size, mirror today's passengers going about their day's work.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1997, Gentleman wrote and illustrated six travel books: \"David Gentleman’s Britain, London, Coastline, Paris, India\" and \"Italy\", and more recently \"London You’re Beautiful\", 2012 and \"In the Country\", 2014. He also wrote and illustrated four books about a small child on holiday: \"Fenella in Ireland, Greece, Spain\" and \"the South of France.\"\n\nGentleman has illustrated many books by other people, including drawings for the cookbook \"Plats du Jour\". In 2009 he painted watercolours to illustrate \"Ask the Fellows Who Cut the Hay\" by George Ewart Evans. For the Limited Editions Club of New York City he illustrated \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\" Keats's Poems, \"The Jungle Book,\" and \"The Ballad of Robin Hood,\" and several books for children, including Russell Hoban's \"The Dancing Tigers.\" He has designed many paperback covers and jackets: for Penguin Books, E. M. Forster's novels and the New Penguin Shakespeare wood engravings; for Faber, many watercolours for Siegfried Sassoon and Lawrence Durrell novels; and for Duckworth, wood engraved or typographical designs for scientific and classical works.\n\nBetween 1962 and 2000 Gentleman designed 103 stamps for the Post Office, making him the most prolific stamp designer in Britain at that time. These include sets for Shakespeare, Churchill, Darwin, British Ships, Concorde, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of Hastings, the BBC, Good King Wenceslas, The Twelve Days of Christmas, Social Reformers, Ely Cathedral, Abbotsbury Swannery and the Millennium.\n\nHis stamp designs included an album of experimental designs commissioned by Tony Benn, then Postmaster General to show how stamps could dispense with the large photograph of the Queen then mandatory, or alternatively replace it with a smaller profile silhouette derived initially from Mary Gillick's coinage head. More than 40 years later, the wider range of subjects, the profile and the simpler designs that it made possible remain a feature of all British special stamps.\n\nHe won the Phillips Gold Medal for postage stamp design in both 1969 and 1979.\n\nThe Royal Mint have issued two of Gentleman's coin designs. The first (issued jointly with the Monnaie de Paris in 2004) celebrated the centenary of the Entente Cordiale, and the second in 2007 commemorated the bicentenary of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. Other miniature design commissions have included symbols or logos for the Bodleian Library, British Steel and a redesign of the National Trust's familiar symbol of a spray of oak leaves.\n\nGentleman has designed posters for public institutions including London Transport (Visitors' London and Victorian London), the Imperial War Museum, and the Public Record Office. A series in the seventies for the National Trust, used unconventional designs, photographs and photo-montages; some won design awards. Later, poster-like designs replaced words in his book \"A Special Relationship\" (Faber, 1979) on the US/UK alliance. Gentleman regretted that these images were not displayed as actual posters. On the eve of the Iraq war in 2003, Gentleman offered the Stop the War Coalition a poster saying simply 'No', which was carried on the protest march. Other march placards followed, including 'No more lies' and 'Bliar'. His largest design was an installation in 2007 of 100,000 drops of blood, one for each person already killed in that war. The bloodstains were printed on 1,000 sheets of card pegged out in a vast square covering the grass in Parliament Square.\n\nGentleman's first lithographs were posters for a Royal College of Art theatre group production of \"Orphee\" and a student exhibition, and one of his first commissions was for a large Lyons lithograph. Between 1970 and 2008 he made suites of lithographs of buildings (Covent Garden, South Carolina, Bath) and landscapes (of Gordale Scar, of the Seven Sisters, and of Suffolk subjects). These lithographs were printed in colour and were essentially representational. In 1970 he made six more poster-like screenprints, \"Fortifications\", published in New York City. A number of these are in the collections of Tate Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His parents hoped he would become an electrical engineer, so he was educated at the Technical College in Wimbledon, then worked for the Marconi Telegraph and Wireless company as a joint-solderer. He made his stage debut at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in 1945 at the age of 17.\n\nIn 1955, he played the title role in Ben Jonson's \"Volpone\" at the Bristol Old Vic. He won the London Evening Standard award in 1959 for his performance in Ibsen's \"Rosmersholm\" at the Royal Court Theatre. In 1960 he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company; that year, he played Ferdinand in John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\". In 1962, he performed as Iachimo in \"Cymbeline\". Other roles included Ulysses, Macbeth, Leontes, Malvolio, Shylock, King Lear and Henry IV, as well as Barabas in Marlowe's \"Jew of Malta\". Porter was seen as the tortured solicitor Soames Forsyte in the BBC drama \"The Forsyte Saga\" (1967). The series was a huge international success, and his role, for which he won a BAFTA Best Actor award, also made him a star.\n\nHis 1981 portrayal of Neville Chamberlain in \"\" won critical praise.

His last on-screen role was as painter James Player in the remake of \"Message for Posterity\" (1994), a television play by Dennis Potter. Susan Engel told biographer Robert Sellers that Eric Porter was gay: \"His memorable BAFTA Best Actor Award-winning performance as Soames in the BBC's 1967 television adaptation of \"The Forsyte Saga\" should have led to greater things, but it didn't. 'He couldn't cope with his own sexuality,' says Susan. 'It was so awful for gay men in those days. I don't know how some of them managed to survive; and many didn't.

{"id": "1899444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899444", "title": "Benomyl", "text": "Benomyl\n\nBenomyl (also marketed as Benlate) is a fungicide introduced in 1968 by DuPont. It is a systemic benzimidazole fungicide that is selectively toxic to microorganisms and invertebrates, especially earthworms, but nontoxic toward mammals. \n\nDue to the prevalence of resistance of parasitic fungi to benomyl, it and similar pesticides are of diminished effectiveness. Nonetheless it is widely used.\n\nBenomyl is of low toxicity to mammals. It has an arbitrary LD of \"greater than 10,000 mg/kg/day for rats\". Skin irritation may occur through industrial exposure, and florists, mushroom pickers and floriculturists have reported allergic reactions to benomyl.\n\nIn a laboratory study, dogs fed benomyl in their diets for three months developed no major toxic effects, but did show evidence of altered liver function at the highest dose (150 mg/kg). With longer exposure, more severe liver damage occurred, including cirrhosis.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency classified benomyl as a possible carcinogen. Carcinogenic studies have produced conflicting results. A two-year experimental study on mice has shown it \"probably\" causes an increase in liver tumours. The British Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food took the view this was brought about by the hepatotoxic effect of benomyl.\n\nIn regards to occupational exposures to benomyl, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit of 15 mg/m for total exposure over an eight-hour time-weighted average, and 5 mg/m for respiratory exposures.\n\nIn 1996, a Miami jury awarded US$4 million to a child whose mother was exposed in pregnancy to Benlate. The child was born without eyes (anophthalmia). The mother had been exposed to an unusually high dose of Benlate through her exposure from a near by farm, during pregnancy. An important issue in the case was the timing and magnitude of exposure.\n\nIn October 2008, DuPont paid confidential settlements to two New Zealand families whose children were born with either anophthalmia or other birth defects. The mother of one of the children had been exposed to Benlate while working as a Christchurch parks worker before his birth.\n\nBenomyl binds strongly to soil and does not dissolve in water to any great extent. It has a half-life in turf of three to six months, and in bare soil, a half-life of six months to one year.\n\nIn 1991, DuPont issued a recall of its Benlate 50DF formula due to suspected contamination with the herbicide atrazine. In the wake of the recall, many US growers blamed Benlate 50DF for destroying millions of dollars' worth of crops. Growers filed over 1,900 damage claims against DuPont, mostly involving ornamental crops in Florida. Subsequent testing by DuPont determined the recalled product was not contaminated with atrazine. The reason for the alleged crop damage is unclear. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services suggested Benlate was contaminated with dibutylurea and sulfonylurea herbicides.\n\nAfter several years of legal argument, DuPont paid out about US$750 million in damages and out-of-court settlements. By 1993, a coalition of farm worker and environmental groups came together to form \"Benlate Victims Against DuPont\", a group which called for a nationwide boycott of DuPont products.\n\nAfter carrying out tests, DuPont denied Benlate was contaminated with dibutylurea and sulfonylureas and stopped compensation pay-outs. In 1995, a Florida judge rejected a complaint from the Florida Department of Agriculture that had alleged such a link.\n\nBenomyl is used in molecular biology to study the cell cycle in yeast; in fact, the name of the protein class \"Bub\" (Bub1, etc.) comes from their mutant in which budding was uninhibited by benomyl. Benomyl acts by depolymerizing microtubules. Benomyl is also useful in the laboratory because it is selectively toxic to most members of the Ascomycota, whereas members of the Basidiomycota are largely resistant.\n\n"}
{"id": "1899450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899450", "title": "Shadow Hearts: Covenant", "text": "Shadow Hearts: Covenant\n\nShadow Hearts: Covenant is a role-playing video game developed by Nautilus (Sacnoth) for the PlayStation 2, and is the second entry in the \"Shadow Hearts\" series. Published in Japan by Aruze in 2004, the game was released internationally by Midway Games in 2004 (North America) and 2005 (Europe). A director's cut with additional content was released in Japan in 2005.\n\n\"Covenant\" takes place in 1915, six months after the events of the first game. At the height of World War I, German Army lieutenant Karin Koenig is drawn into a conflict between original protagonist Yuri Hyuga and the secret society Sapientes Gladio. During gameplay, the player explores various locations through a growing party of characters. Three characters take part in turn-based battles against a variety of enemies, with actions relying on a timing-based system dubbed the Judgement Ring. The game's worldview combines alternate history with elements of Lovecraftian horror.\n\n\"Covenant\" began development in the autumn of 2002; returning staff members included writer and director Matsuzo Machida, artist Miyako Kato, and composer Yoshitaka Hirota. The team redesigned the battle system, and altered the story's tone based on feedback from the first game's players. The localization was handled by Jeremy Blaustein, who remembered the game as one of his favourite projects. Selling around 240,000 units in Japan and North America, the game was praised by reviewers. It has since been ranked by several journalistic sites as one of the best games of its time. A third \"Shadow Hearts\" title, \"\", released in 2005.\n\n\"Shadow Hearts\" is a role-playing video game (RPG) where players take control of a party led by either Karin Koenig or Yuri Hyuga as they progress through the game; progress is split between a linear story-driven first half and a second half which allows greater exploration and access to optional areas. During gameplay, the party explores a number of town and country areas across the Eurasian continent, collecting and buying items and equipment, talking to non-playable characters who act as quests givers and merchants, and completing both story-centered quests and side quests.\n\nThe game's turn-based battles are triggered through both random and scripted encounters. Turn order is dependent on a character's \"speed\" statistic. Each player character has hit points (health), skill points (magic), and sanity points (SP). SP ordinarily decreases once per turn, and when a character runs out of SP they go berserk and cannot be controlled by the player. Actions include a variety of normal attacks, special attacks specific to characters which are earned through side tasks, Crest magic which can be assigned to different characters, Items such as healing and modifiers for character abilities, and defending against attacks. After each battle, characters earn experience points to raise their level and character attributes, and Soul energy from defeated monsters. The higher a character's level, the more Crests can be equipped.\n\nA key element of gameplay is the Judgement Ring. Represented as a disc with colored areas on its surface, the player's aim is to hit those areas as a pointer passes over them. If the player fails to hit an area, the attack can either be shortened or cancelled altogether. Magic attacks use green hit areas during the initial stages of an attack. For items, blue hit areas are used with increasing hue; the deeper the hue when the player triggers the action, the more effective that item is on its target. The final portion of each target area is red, and if the player hits it the attack or skill is boosted in power. The Judgement Ring is also used outside battle in shops; when shopping at a merchant, hitting the right areas can discount prices and increase sale values for items.\n\nThe Judgement Ring is used with every battle action, from standard attacks and special abilities to item use. Some status ailments impact how the Judgement Rings behave. An individual character's Judgement Ring moves at a different speed, and can be customised; options include adjusting hit zone numbers, increasing hit area size, increasing damage while decreasing hit area size, and activating an auto battle option at the cost of attack power. Characters, including some enemy types, can use combos with two or more characters. Combos require successful use of the Judgement Ring, in addition to a button trigger to continue and complete the combo. If the button input fails, or a non-compatible ability is used, the combo is broken and all remaining characters lose their turn actions. Each successful hit in a combo increases damage for the next character's action. Using four characters in a successful combo triggers a fifth special magical attack.\n\nA key ability for both Yuri and late-game playable character Kurando Inugami is Fusion, the ability to transform into a monstrous creature with access to unique abilities. Character attributes are also changed depending on the Fusion type. New fusions for Yuri are unlocked in the Graveyard, a realm within his soul accessed either at save points or on the world map. Charging gravestones with Soul energy gathered from defeated enemies unlocks new Fusions within a specific group. Activating a Fusion costs a set amount of SP, with additional SP reduced each turn by an amount dictated by the Fusion form's power.\n\n\"Shadow Hearts\" is set in an alternate reality, taking place in the year 1915 during World War I, and mingling historical events and people with supernatural elements including divine beings and cosmic horror. The story shifts locations between Europe, Russia, the Near East and Japan. Another key location is the metaphysical Graveyard. The story takes place six months after the events of \"Shadow Hearts\", following on from that game's \"bad\" ending.\n\nThe main protagonists are Karin Koenig (voiced by Jennifer Jean), a German Army lieutenant; and Yuri Hyuga (voiced by Joey Capps), the main protagonist of \"Shadow Hearts\". Following the events of \"Shadow Hearts\" which culminated in the death of his lover Alice Elliot (voiced by Georgette Rose), a depressed Yuri buried Alice in Domrémy-la-Pucelle, taking it upon himself to defend the town from the War. During their journey, Karin and Yuri are joined by a large cast including Gepetto (voiced by Amos Nandy), Alice's uncle; Blanca, an intelligent wolf-like dog; Joachim Valentine (voiced by Francis C. Cole), a vampire obsessed with wrestling; Lucia, a fortune teller; a fictionalized version of Anastasia Nikolaevna; and Kurando Inugami (voiced by Todd Hodges), a swordsman from Japan.\n\nThe main antagonists are members of Sapientes Gladio, a formerly peaceful secret society perverted into a terrorist group; key characters are its current leader Grigori Rasputin (voiced by John Smallberries), and his right-hand man, Nicolai Conrad (voiced by Ardwight Chamberlain). Additional characters include Roger Bacon (voiced by Amos Nandy), a 12th-century philosopher who achieved imperfect immortality; Kato (voiced by Taylor Henry), a former ally of Yuri's; Jeanne, a young girl from Domrémy; \"Shadow Hearts\" antagonist Albert Simon, who appears as a vision in Yuri's mind; Jovis Abraham, the original co-founder of Sapientes Gladio; the Japanese foreign minister Kantaro Ishimura (voiced by Michael McConnohie); and Ouka (voiced by Georgette Rose), a cloned version of Kato's dead lover, Yoshiko Kawashima.\n\nDuring a mission to Domrémy, Karin's unit are attacked by a demon. To combat him, Karin is partnered with Nicolai to retrieve an artifact called the Holy Mistletoe from Apoina Tower in the Vatican City. Returning to Domrémy, the \"demon\" turns out to be Yuri, and Nicolai reveals his true goal of destroying Yuri before he can threaten Sapientes Gladio while holding the girl Jeanne hostage. Yuri ends up impaled by the Mistletoe, which begins disrupting his powers and releasing trapped Malice, a dark energy generated by monsters. During the attacks on Domrémy, Jeanne is killed, and in Yuri's journey her spirit resides in the Graveyard. Nicolai blackmails Yuri into retrieving the forbidden Émigré Manuscript in exchange for releasing the captured Roger Bacon. The group are double-crossed, and ultimately rescue Bacon. Guided by Bacon, they head to Russia to face Rasputin. Rasputin is fuelling the war through Sapientes Gladio and an alliance with Japanese sympathisers, his ultimate goal being to replace Nicholas II of Russia with Nicolai, the tzar's illegitimate heir. After learning of Rasputin's invulnerability due to his pact with the god Asmodeus, the group flee Russia along with the endangered Anastasia.\n\nTo overcome Rasputin's power, the group find Abraham; he reveals that Albert Simons' actions during the events of \"Shadow Hearts\" were an attempt to foil Rasputin. Yuri travels inside his soul with Karin's help, meeting Simons' spirit and taming the god Amon. The group return to Russia, exposing Rasputin. Defeated by Amon, Rasputin sacrifices his soul to Asmodeus, who takes over his body and summons a magical fortress, aiming to obliterate humanity. Prior to leaving, Nicolai confronts Rasputin, revealing that he has made a pact with the god Astaroth. Yuri's group defeats Rasputin, but before dying he reveals that the Mistletoe's Curse will destroy Yuri's memories, and that Nicolai intends to release the Malice from Apoina Tower, increasing the War's barbarity. The group are too late to stop Nicolai releasing Malice into the world as an act of defiance against Yuri. They are about to kill him when Kato intervenes, sealing Apoina Tower and leaving with both Nicolai and the Émigré Manuscript due to Japan's alliance with Russia.\n\nIn Japan, Foreign Minister Ishimura intends to use Nicolai to destabilise the West and protect Japan from its influence. Attempts to extract Astaroth give the demon full control of Nicolai's body. Yuri's group, allied with his cousin Kurando, fail to prevent Astaroth's escape due to the opposition of Kato and his cloned group of soldiers which includes Ouka. After Astaroth's escape, Kato helps Yuri's group defeat the god at its lair in Mount Fuji. The enraged Nicholai tries to kill Yuri, then attacks Kato when he intercedes; Ouka blocks the blow, dying in Kato's arms. Kato kills Nicolai, later giving Yuri the Émigré Manuscript to attempt Alice's resurrection and declaring them now enemies. The group confront Ishimura, and when his grandson appears and Ishimura begs they spare him, Yuri flies into a rage and nearly kills Ishimura before breaking down in tears, having forgotten his reason for fighting. Bacon helps Yuri attempt Alice's resurrection. The ritual briefly works, with Alice assuring her love for Yuri before her new body disintegrates. Bacon deduces that Kato encouraged the ritual to use its side effect of time warping for his own ends; Kato plans to travel back in time and rewrite history, unmaking the current world.\n\nAfter meeting Alice's spirit and having a final talk with Jeanne, Yuri faces Kato as he summons the magical Asuka Stone Platform to enact his plan. Kato is defeated, and tells Yuri that the group must wish for their heart's desire in order to escape. As the others depart to places they can find happiness, the Mistletoe's Curse manifests, and Yuri bids Karin farewell and remains behind. Depending on his answer to a question from Jeanne, Yuri can allow the Curse to consume him and end up in Roger's care as an amnesiac; or commit suicide, reuniting with Alice's spirit before going back in time to the day they met and getting the chance to save her. The latter has been confirmed as the canon ending. Whatever Yuri's choice, Karin is sent back in time to Tokyo in 1887, there meeting Yuri's father and deciding to move on with her life; Karin uses the name \"Anne\", and becomes Yuri's mother.\n\n\"Covenant\" was developed by Sacnoth, the same studio that had handled both \"Shadow Hearts\" and series predecessor \"Koudelka\". During the game's development, Sacnoth was rebranded as Nautilus, with \"Covenant\" being the company's first title released under the new branding. Matsuzo Machida returned as director and writer, and Miyako Kato as character designer. The art director was Takamusa Ohsawa. Production of the game began in the autumn of 2002. For the sequel of \"Shadow Hearts\" the staff wanted to maintain the serious atmosphere from the prequel, while still containing punchlines as comic relief. This was due to feedback from players who felt the storyline and overall tone of \"Shadow Hearts\" was too dark and disturbing.\n\nThe theme of the game is \"happiness\", alluding how people may find happiness in many different ways, reflected mainly in Yuri's story. Due to Yuri's popularity, the character returned for the sequel. The staff initially had the idea of bringing him back alongside Alice as a happily married couple, but ultimately believed that this did not fit the serious tone of the game. As a result, the plot begins with Alice dead, resulting in a negative response from the fans. Machida, impressed with the fans' backlash regarding Yuri not being Karin's lover due to their preference to the relationship between Yuri and Alice, answered that they should play the game. The final plot twist of Karin being Yuri's mother was not decided until Machida was writing the ending. While the more conventional route would be to have Yuri partner with Karin, he felt that went against the \"pure love theme\" around Yuri and Alice. He also reasoned that Yuri would not have the impetus to change the past if he accepted Karin's love.\n\nOhsawa reported that Machida gave his team the \"impossible\" task of making the 3D character models exactly match their 2D concept illustrations. As with the first game, monster designs drew inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Incorporating real-time events into the game proved difficult for the staff, although they enjoyed the challenge it provided. Excluding Blanca, who was used for comic relief, real actors were used for all the cast's motion capture. Machida created the storyboards at the beginning of production; initially planning two and a half hours of cutscenes, it eventually extended to over four hours. The game's CGI cutscenes were produced by Avant. A focus for the developers was adjusting the camera angles during real-time scenes.\n\nThe combat system of \"Shadow Hearts\" was revamped for \"Covenant\", in response to criticism of the first game's mechanics. The Judgement Ring was redesigned, resulting in the addition pf multiple ring types and an \"auto\" mode. The combo system was implemented to make the game feel more rewarding for advanced players. Designer Takehiro Ishida said the reworked battle system would provide a greater sense of speed and action for players, describing its production as a challenge. Machida estimated the gameplay content as being around 40 hours, twice that of the first game. Adjustments and tuning of the mechanics went on until the end of development.\n\nThe music of \"Covenant\" was composed by Yoshitaka Hirota, with additional contributions by Yasunori Mitsuda, Kenji Ito and Tomoko Kobayashi; Kobayashi's contributions were limited to story-related pieces. The three composers were asked to examine and deconstruct the sound of the original \"Shadow Hearts\". Due to the shift in tone, Hirota made the soundtrack more dynamic and emotional without surrendering the signature \"Shadow Hearts\" sound. The final soundtrack included over sixty pieces. The previous game's main theme \"Icaro\" returned in arranged forms. The ending theme \"Getsurenka\" was written by Hirota and performed by Mio Isayama, with lyrics by Kumiko Hasegawa. A 2CD soundtrack album, \"Shadow Hearts II Original Soundtrack\", was published by Team Entertainment on March 24, 2004.\n\nThe existence of a sequel to \"Shadow Hearts\" was first revealed in early June 2003 by Japanese video game website \"Quiter\". It was officially announced under its official Japanese title \"Shadow Hearts II\" two weeks later. The game was released on February 19, 2004 by Aruze. It came as both a standard edition and a limited edition featuring a CD with cast interviews and artwork, and themed merchandise. A budget release \"Director's Cut\" was released on March 10, 2005. It included new and expanded dungeons, new story sequences, new sections where players controlled a group of the main antagonists, and a new CGI cutscene replacing the real-time cutscene of Yuri and Alice's meeting. Four guidebooks were released between February and June 2004. An authorized comic anthology was published by Studio DNA in June 2004. Other merchandise included sheet music and a perfume themed after the main protagonist. In 2008, Aruze used \"Covenant\" as the theme for one of its slot machines.\n\nA Western release in North America and Europe from Midway Games was announced in April 2004 as \"Shadow Hearts: Covenant\". The game was translated into English by ZPang America, and dubbed at the studio of Intersound Post Production. The English script was written by returning translator Jeremy Blaustein, returning from \"Shadow Hearts\". Looking back on his work, Blaustein picked out \"Covenant\" as one of his favorite projects and the one he would wish to be remembered for. He was given \"a relatively free hand\" when translating, and arranged for voice recording to happen at a good studio in Los Angeles. As voice director, Blaustine brought on Richard Epcar, who was noted for his work in both anime and gaming. In addition to directing voice acting, he took some roles in \"Covenant\". The game released in North America on September 27, 2004. It released in Europe the following year on March 11.\n\nAccording to Aruze, sales in Japan had reached around 150,000 units by November 2004. A different estimate from an unnamed Nautilus program director said that it sold 120,000 units in Japan by 2005. The game was counted as a success by Aruze, and cited as a factor in their gaming division earning a profit during the late 2004 period. Alongside other titles, the game was credited with a rise in sale revenues for Midway Games during the 2004-2005 fiscal year. Sales in North America were similar to that of the Japanese version by 2005 according to Nautilus.\n\nJapanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" recommended the game to players who enjoyed dark settings and characters. Jeremy Parish, writing for \"1UP.com\", praised the narrative for its contemporary setting and open association with real-life political and religious organisations. \"Eurogamer\"s Rob Fahey criticised the increasing complexity of the plot and need for players to know the original game's story. \"GamePro\" focused on the game's comedic elements, which it praised as having translated well from Japanese to English. Bethany Massimilla of \"GameSpot\" lauded the blend of serious narrative, mystical elements, and different types of comedy. \"GameSpy\"s Steve Steinberg was also positive, warning that those looking for a serious narrative might be turned off by the humour, and also noting some pacing issues. Jeremy Dunham, writing for \"IGN\", praised both the wider narrative and how the characters were written. \"PALGN\"s Mark Marrow said that \"Covenant\" \"produces one of the finest available [stories]\" in RPGs. Patrick Gann of \"RPGFan\" was positive overall, praising the game's alternate history setting.\n\nLisa Mason of \"Game Informer\" referred to the graphics as \"jaggy, but really nicely detailed\", sentiments echoed by \"GamePro\". Massimilla called the blend of background art, in-game graphics and CGI cutscenes \"very easy on the eye\". Dunham cited the general presentation as a step up from that of \"Shadow Hearts\" despite console-specific graphical faults. Marrow had similar comments to Dunham, saying the game was \"extremely fulfilling and very nice on the eyes.\" Gann generally lauded the game's graphics as a significant improvement over \"Shadow Hearts\", and praise the character designs. The soundtrack met with general praise, although some felt it was inferior to the first game. Reactions to the English voice work were mixed; some praised it, while others felt it lacked polish.\n\n\"Famitsu\" lauded the game's \"unique and detailed\" battle system, and expanded breadth compared to the first \"Shadow Hearts\". While Parish found the battle system enjoyable, he noted an archaic structure that was at odds with many other RPGs of the time and a sense of the developers including a little of anything to catch attention, which could potentially hold the game back from mainstream appeal. Fahay found the turn-based mechanics refreshing after recent action-oriented titles like \"\", and praised the Judgement Ring mechanics despite it feeling old-fashioned compared to the similar turn-based system of \"Final Fantasy X\". Mason again praised the Judgement Ring and combo system, saying they made up for the slow character progression system. \"GamePro\" was generally enthusiastic about the gameplay, and Massimilla lauded the various mechanics for the need for player engagement compared to other similar battle systems. Steinberg called \"Covenant\" \"a nifty twist on the traditional RPG\" due to its unconventional battle mechanics. Dunham again called the system superior to the first game, giving praise to the battles and wider customization options available to players. Marrow once more shared these sentiments, saying that players would be pleasantly lost in the breadth of content available beyond the main story. Gann praised the battle mechanics, and enjoyed the game's level scaling system.\n\nIn \"RPGamer\"s 2004 staff awards, \"Covenant\" won in both the \"Best PlayStation 2\" and \"Best Overall\" categories. It was also \"IGN\"s RPG Vault PS2 Game of the Year. \"RPGFan\" staff, in an episode of their retrospective series \"Retro Encounter\", fondly remembered \"Covenant\" as one of the best RPGs they had played in 2004, despite some aspects not aging well over the years. In the years following its release, websites including \"IGN\", \"GamesRadar\", \"PlayStation Lifestyle\" \"Game Informer\", and \"Polygon\" ranked it as either one of the best RPGs or one of the best games of all time. \"GameTrailers\" called \"Covenant\" \"the greatest JRPG that no-one talks about\" due to its unconventional tone and battle system.\n\nAccording to Machida, plans were made for a \"Shadow Hearts III\" which would have continued Yuri's story, but these never materialised. A third game in the series, \"\", was produced by Nautilus. Many team members returned, and the game's production was completed in a very short time. Released in Japan in Aruze in 2005, it was published in by Xseed Games in North America the following year, and in Europe by Ghostlight in 2007. \"From The New World\" was the last game produced by Nautilus before their 2007 absorption into Aruze, when they ceased console game development.\n\n (Archived 2005)\n"}

It took place on 24 May 1798 after the stationing of the 9th Dragoons, and members of the Tyrone, Antrim and Armagh Militias at Ballymore in County Kildare near the Kildare-Wicklow border on 10 May. The town had been recently garrisoned by almost 200 soldiers and militia who had been sent to repress sedition in the area. The troops had been dispersed in billets among the populace as per counter-insurgency practice of \"free-quarters\" where responsibility for the provisioning and sheltering of militia was foisted onto the populace. During this time a quantity of arms were surrendered and letters of protection issued. \n\nOn 23 May, 120 soldiers were recalled, leaving a garrison of around 40-50 men. At around 1 a.m. on 24 May, the rebel force of approx. 500 attacked the town. As in the attacks on Naas and Prosperous, the rebels sought to surprise and overwhelm the garrison by coordinated attacks before it could react and rally against them. The houses containing troops of the 9th Dragoons and the Tyrone Militia were to be attacked simultaneously. \n\nHowever, the attack on garrison headquarters was miscarried due to lack of coordination and numbers so that the building became a rallying point for the Government troops. Captain Beevor was attacked in his own bedchamber by two rebels. Lieutenant Parkinson and some dragoons came to his aid and both rebels were slain. Other isolated billets were attacked but some units managed to cut themselves free and fight their way through the streets to the headquarters. A number of properties, including the Protestant church, were set on fire. \n\nFor two hours, the rebels attacked the strongpoint but without artillery, were unable to take the building and lost many men in the process. The momentum had by now slipped away from the rebels, and a decisive counter charge by dragoons routed them leaving behind around 100 dead but at a cost to the garrison of at least 12 dead and 5 wounded.\n\nThe battle led directly to the Massacre of Dunlavin Green, in which fears of a possible rebel attack on the garrison at nearby Dunlavin led to the mass execution of rebel prisoners.\n"}

It is often used together with chloroquine or atovaquone. When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth.\nSide effects include diarrhea, constipation, skin rashes, hair loss, and itchiness. Because malaria tends to be more severe in pregnancy, the benefit typically outweighs the risk. If used during pregnancy it should be taken with folate. It is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. Proguanil is converted by the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil.\nProguanil has been studied at least since 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$0.10–0.50 per day. In the United States and Canada it is only available in combination as atovaquone/proguanil.\n\nProguanil is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant \"P. falciparum\" malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with atovaquone, another antimalarial drug.\n\nIt is also effective in the treatment of most other multi-drug resistant forms of \"P. falciparum\"; the success rate exceeds 93%.\n\nProguanil is generally well tolerated, and most people do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking proguanil with food may lessen these side effects. Proguanil should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5 kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment.\n\nWhen used alone, proguanil functions as a prodrug. Its active metabolite, cycloguanil, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although both mammals and parasites produce DHFR, cycloguanil's inhibitory activity is specific for parasitic DHFR. This enzyme is a critical component of the folic acid cycle. Inhibition of DHFR prevents the parasite from recycling dihydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is required for DNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and methylation; thus, DHFR inhibition shuts down these processes.\n\nProguanil displays synergism when used in combination with the antimalarial atovaquone. This mechanism of action differs from when proguanil was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of proguanil has shown to reduce resistance to atovaquone and increase the ability of atovaquone to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as \"collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential.\" Proguanil lowers the effective concentration of atovaquone needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 10, 2002. It was intended to be the season premiere, but \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\" was moved ahead for Halloween. \n\nThis episode was heavily promoted due to its list of high-profile guest stars, and is the last episode written by Mike Scully. This episode is also the last to use traditional cel animation. Three weeks later, \"Helter Shelter\" became the last traditional cel-animated episode to air.\n\nOn a visit to Moe's, Homer has no money to pay for his beer and Moe will not give him any freebies. As a result, he goes around town trying other things to feel drunk, such as breathing thin air on top of a mountain, licking toads and giving blood. Moe feels guilty about refusing to serve Homer and gives him a free beer, but Homer is already heavily intoxicated. Moe, Lenny and Carl put Homer in a taxi to take him home. In the cab he is secretly videotaped for a reality show called \"Taxicab Conversations\", and says some unpleasant things about Marge and the kids, as well as revealing his dream of becoming a rock star. His family is not impressed with him, but soon realize that they do somewhat burden him. To make up for this, the family takes Homer to a Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp, run by the Rolling Stones. At the camp, Homer and a bunch of other Springfield citizens learn about rock music, from instructors Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Elvis Costello, Lenny Kravitz, Tom Petty and Brian Setzer. Finally, the wannabe-rockstars have a mock rock concert, with Homer as the lead guitarist and singer.\n\nWhen Homer learns that the camp is just a one-week only camp, he is bitterly disappointed and refuses to leave. Mick Jagger eventually placates Homer by offering him a chance to perform at a benefit gig, the \"Concert for Planet Hollywood\". An excited Homer gets passes for his friends so they can see him at the concert. Homer's glee turns to embarrassment when he is asked to perform the duties of a roadie. When he goes on stage to test the microphone, seeing his family and friends out there rooting for him, he sings a rock song and steals the show. This angers the rock stars, who attempt to run Homer off the stage with a big mobile fire-breathing devil's head. The devil's head goes out of control and plows into the audience.\n\nThe performers, feeling sorry about their actions, offer Homer an opportunity to perform at another benefit concert (for the victims of the recently messed-up gig), but he declines and prefers to perform at home instead. However, at the end of the episode he replaces his car with the big devil's head (given to him by the band) using it to take Bart and Lisa to school. Principal Skinner tells Homer that he is not allowed to stop his car in the school bus zone. In retaliation, Homer activates the devil's fire breath, burning off Skinner's clothes, much to the delight of the kids.\n\nThe cab videotaping Homer is a parody of \"Taxicab Confessions\". The title of the episode is a play on words, referencing Joe Strummer of The Clash; in something of an unfortunate coincidence, Strummer would succumb to a sudden, fatal heart attack just one month after the episode's original airdate. The couch gag is a visual pun of the slang term \"jump the shark\", which describes when a TV show has reached its creative peak and is slowly declining in quality.\n\nWhen the camp is over, Mick Jagger tells Homer to cheer up, \"it's only rock and roll camp\", and Homer responds, \"but I like it.\" This is in reference to the Rolling Stones song \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\". The songs include \"Rip This Joint\", \"Start Me Up\", and \"She's So Cold\", all by the Rolling Stones; \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\" by Lenny Kravitz; \"Pump It Up\" by Elvis Costello; and \"The Last DJ\" by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. The name of the camp is a reference to Bad Company song \"Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\".\n\nThe episode title is a reference to a short essay that many children are asked to write upon returning to school after the summer vacation.\n\nIn 2003, Annie Alleman of \"The Herald News\" named the episode her all-time favorite \"Simpsons\" episode. \n\nThe same year, writers of \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed it as the twenty-second best \"Simpsons\" episode of all time. They elaborated that \"You've gotta admire a show that lands the greatest names in rock and then gives them as much respect as a brown M&M. [...] While rockers have always shone in 'Simpsons' solos, the Stones so giddily mock their hall-of-fame status it makes \"Strummer\" the series' Woodstock: a classic-rock show even Disco Stu could get behind.\" \n\nRobert Canning of IGN in a Flashback Review gave the episode an 8.6 saying it was \"Great\" and also stated \"In a season that I generally see as ho-hum (\"Pray Anything\" is the only other episode I rate highly), \"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\" simply rocks\". In 2007, \n\nSimon Crerar of \"The Times\" listed Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Elvis Costello and Lenny Kravitz's performances among the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. \n\nIn 2011, Kravitz revealed that his greatest achievement was the appearance on \"The Simpsons\" in the eyes of his young relatives. He explained that \"To my nieces and nephews appearing on 'The Simpsons' was when I actually made it. All the other stuff doesn't count.\" \n\n\"New York\" magazine named the episode one of the top ten later \"Simpsons\" episodes.\n\n"}

His most acclaimed paintings are urban landscapes of Manchester, now in the collection of Manchester Art Gallery. Today, he is chiefly remembered as L. S. Lowry's tutor.\n\nBorn in Saint-Étienne in eastern central France, on 13 October 1876, he trained at the in Bordeaux. Valette arrived in England for unknown reasons in 1904 and studied at the Birkbeck Institute, now part of the University of London. In 1905 he travelled to the North West of England where he designed greetings cards and calendars for a Manchester printing company. He attended evening classes at Manchester Municipal School of Art and in 1907 he was invited to join the staff as a teacher. His French teaching style, painting by demonstration, was new to the United Kingdom.\nSalford painter, L. S. Lowry became a pupil of Valette, expressed great admiration for his tutor, who taught him new techniques and showed him the potential of the urban landscape as a subject. He called him \"a real teacher ... a dedicated teacher\" and added: \"I cannot over-estimate the effect on me of the coming into this drab city of Adolphe Valette, full of French impressionists, aware of everything that was going on in Paris.\"\n\nIn 1920 Valette resigned from the Institute owing to ill health. He stayed in Lancashire for eight more years, teaching privately and painting in Manchester and Bolton. In 1928 he returned to Paris, and subsequently moved to Blacé en Beaujolais where he died in 1942.\n\nValette's paintings are Impressionist, a style that suited the damp fogginess of Manchester. Manchester Art Gallery has a room devoted to him, where the viewer may compare some of his paintings with some of Lowry's, and judge to what extent Lowry's own style was influenced by him and by French Impressionism generally.\n\nThe Lowry hosted an exhibition of about 100 works by Valette, alongside works by Lowry, between October 2011 and January 2012. It included paintings of Manchester from Manchester Art Gallery and loans from private owners.\n\nThere is a commemorative blue plaque to Valette, located on the site on Manchester School of Art on Grosvenor Street, in Manchester, inscribed \"Adolphe Valette (1876 - 1942) French painter and teacher in the School of Art 1907 - 1920.\"\n\nNotes\n\n"}

Truman in his inaugural address on January 20, 1949. It took its name from the fact that it was the fourth foreign policy objective mentioned in the speech.\n\nFollowing World War Two, the United States found itself in a Cold War struggle against the USSR. The Truman administration came up with the idea for a technical assistance program as a means to win the \"hearts and minds\" of the developing world after countries from the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and Africa had complained about the emphasis on European aid by the U.S. \n\nBy sharing US know-how in various fields, especially agriculture, industry and health, officials could help \"third world\" nations on the development path, raise the standard of living, and show that democracy and capitalism could provide for the welfare of the individual.\n\nIn his inauguration speech on January 20, 1949, President Truman stated the fourth objective of his foreign policy as follows:\n\n\"we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.\nMore than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.\nFor the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve suffering of these people.\nThe United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques. The material resources which we can afford to use for assistance of other peoples are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible\"\nTruman denied that this was a colonial venture to dominate other countries. Rather, he insisted, \"The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing. All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world’s human and natural resources.\"\n\nThis was not a call for economic aid—on the order of the Marshall Plan but for the US to share its \"know-how\" and help nations develop with technical assistance.\n\nPoint Four was the first global U.S. foreign aid program, yet it drew some inspiration from the nation's wartime Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA), which extended technical assistance to Latin American countries. Nelson Rockefeller, the administrator of the OCIAA, strongly supported the establishment of Point Four in congressional hearings.\n\nAccording to the US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, it was the initiative of the then legal counsel to the president Clark Clifford, who suggested to president Truman to initiate an assistance on a worldwide basis, and to include the issue in his inaugural address. According to Robert Schlesinger's book, \"White House Ghosts\", it was Benjamin H. Hardy who first came up with the concept. After the suggestion was as good as lost in the foggy miasma of the State Department's bureaucracy, Hardy decided to bring the idea to the attention of Truman aide, George Elsey. Elsey and Clifford went on to herald the abstraction into policy. Hardy eventually left the Department of State and became the new Technical Cooperation Administration's Chief Information Officer.\n\nIn order to implement the program, on February 9, 1949 a new committee was established within the Department of State, known as the Technical Assistance Group, chaired by Samuel Hayes. The program was approved by Congress on June 5, 1950 in the Foreign Economic Assistance Act, which allotted to the program a budget of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1950/51. Describing the new program, Truman noted that, \"Communist propaganda holds that the free nations are incapable of providing a decent standard of living for the millions of people in under-developed areas of the earth. The Point Four program will be one of our principal ways of demonstrating the complete falsity of that charge.\"\n\nAfter Congressional approval on October 27, 1950, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program and the OCIAA became incorporated into the new organization. Henry G. Bennett was the first TCA administrator from 1950 to 1951.\n\nThe program was carried out with the countries whose governments concluded bilateral agreements with the US government regarding aid under the program, and the TCA established field missions within those countries, which worked to improve agricultural output and distributed technical know-how on improving the economy in general. The first government to do so was the government of Iran, on October 19, 1950.\n\nThe Point Four Program was different from other programs in that it was not confined to any specific region; it was extended to countries such as Pakistan, Israel, and Jordan, \n\nAmong the first nations to gain extensive technical assistance was India. From 1950-1951 India saw the implementation of a penicillin plantation, an increase in schools and medical research facilities as well as dam construction. In addition to economic assistance India also agreed to maintain a democratic government. U.S. Officials hoped this would prevent India forming alliances with the Soviet Union and China.\n\nRepublican President Dwight D. Eisenhower discarded the Point Four name in favour of simply referring to it as a 'technical assistance program', and reorganized the TCA into the Foreign Operations Administration; its successor agencies include the International Cooperation Administration and the present-day Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Point Four Program was the first US plan designed to improve social, economic and political conditions in 'underdeveloped' nations. It marked the promotion of international development policy to the centre of the U.S. Foreign Policy framework.\n\nAlthough designed to uplift nations, the programmes legacy was one of self-interest as America improved their imports of strategical raw materials, without significantly alleviating the partnered nations of deprivation.

The river's catchment covers .\n\nThe lower Ord river and the conjunction with Cambridge Gulf create the most northern estuarine environment in Western Australia.\n\nThe Ord River Irrigation Scheme was built in stages during the 20th century. Australia's largest artificial lake by volume, Lake Argyle was completed in 1972. It has not been economically successful; $1.45 billion has been spent on the Ord Irrigation Scheme for a return of 17 cents on the dollar, and only 260 jobs created. \n\nThe lower reaches of the river support an important wetland area known as the Ord River Floodplain, a protected area which contains numerous mangrove forests, lagoons, creeks, flats and extensive floodplains.\n\nThe traditional owners are the \"Miriwoong Gajerrong\" peoples who have inhabited the area for thousands of years and knew the Ord river as \"Goonoonoorrang\".\n\nIt was given its current name in honour of Sir Harry St. George Ord GCMG, CB, RE, Governor of Western Australia from 1877 to 1880, by Alexander Forrest on 2 August 1879. Forrest's journal states.\n\nWe are still 300 miles from the telegraph line, and cannot of course tell what difficulties may not yet be in store for us, so I feel bound to push on, at the same time no one can regret more than I do that I am unable to follow this magnificent stream to its mouth which I have no doubt will be found in Cambridge Gulf–the whole of its waters in that case being in Western Australian territory. I have named this river the Ord, after His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia, who has taken so great an interest in this expedition. Marked a tree F 158.\n\nThe headwaters of the Ord river are located below the 983 metre Mount Wells and initially flows east and around the edge of Purnululu National Park before heading north through Lake Argyle then passing west of Kununurra and discharging into the Cambridge Gulf, which is at the southern extremity of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Timor Sea.\nThe river has 35 tributaries of which the five longest are Bow River, Nicholson River, Dunham River, Panton River and Negri Rivers.\n\nThe idea of damming the Ord was first mentioned over 100 years ago, when the Western Australia Commissioner of Tropical Agriculture, Adrian Despeissis, suggested, \nSubstantial wooden dams constructed on a double row of jarrah piles driven into the bed of the river, with a core wall of puddle clay between, would appear to form suitable weirs.\nBetween 1935 and 1942 drought affected the Kimberley Pastoral Industry providing the key motivation for the Ord Scheme. The focus in 1937 was that a dam on the Ord could supplement the pastoral industry.\n\nThen Minister for Lands and Agriculture, F J S Wise, in 1937 wrote \n..we set a plan in motion during the past twelve months in connection with the establishment of experimental areas on Ivanhoe Station somewhere near Carlton Reach.\nCarlton Reach was the largest waterhole in the Kimberley, being naturally dammed and held back by the Bandicoot Bar, a quartzite rock bar that held back the waterhole for many miles forming a natural permanent lake.\n\nIn 1939, Michael Durack and Isaac Steinberg traveled to the region to investigate its suitability for resettling Jewish refugees. Any resettlement scheme would have involved irrigation works on the Ord.\n\nBy 1941 the Carlton Reach Research Station, also known as the Ord River Experimental Station, was set up by Kimberley Michael Durack for the Western Australia Department of Agriculture with funds, supposedly \"siphoned off\" from the Kalgoorlie pipeline and assistance from the Western Australia Public Works Department (PWD).\n\nDuring August 1941 the newly appointed Director of Works, R. J. Dumas, spent three weeks in the East Kimberley, ...accompanied by F. Forman (Government Geologist). T. Brennan (Acting Engineer for the North West), K. Durack, J. Walker (a half caste aboriginal) and a full blood aboriginal, Jacko\n\nThis party travelled by horseback along the Ord River and through the Ord River gorges in the Carr Boyd Range, selecting several possible dam sites. Work continued at the Carlton Reach experimental station for Kim Durack with assistance from his brother William A. Durack, on various agricultural experiments, centred on supplementing the pastoral industry.\n\nEarly in 1944 Dumas wrote to the Commonwealth Government, advising of the soil, botanical, erosion and engineering surveys about to take place in the East Kimberley, explaining, the project must become largely a national one and any assistance from the Commonwealth would be welcome. By May 1944 there was a large body of agriculturalists, botanists and surveyors carrying out investigations in the vicinity of Carlton Reach. The Aborigines who lived in the Ord River basin were decimated through killing and the spread of introduced diseases.\n\nIt would be another two years before the Commonwealth Government became involved, with the establishment of a joint CSIR and Western Australia Department of Agriculture facility. As the Carlton Reach, Ord River experimental station site was river alluvium (red soil) and most of the surveyed agricultural land was \"Cununurra Clay\" (blacksoil - Volcanic soil eroded from the Antrim Plateau Volcanics), it was moved to a new site further down river and the new Kimberley Research Station (KRS) was established in 1946.\n\nIn 1951, The KRS Supervisory Committee (KRSSC) indicated that sugar and rice were two cash crops that could justify dam construction.\n\nOver the 13 years between 1946 and 1959 various agricultural experiments were undertaken at KRS and in April 1959 the KRS Supervisory Committee recommended the establishment of a pilot farm. In August 1959, the Commonwealth Government made a grant of £5m to WA Government, most to be used for the Ord River Scheme.\n\nThe Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA), which was originally known as the Ord River Irrigation Scheme (ORIS) or Ord River Project, when it was approved by the Commonwealth Government, late in 1959 and began in 1960 with the establishment of the town of Kununurra, which was gazetted a town on 10 February 1961.\n\nThe construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam started in late 1960 and was officially opened in July 1963 by then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Ord River Diversion Dam holds back Lake Kununurra, which gravity feeds the Ord River Irrigation Area with water via the Main Channel (M1C1). The main channel is visible in the photograph with Lake Kununurra, Ord River (formerly the Carlton Reach waterhole, Ord River) in the background.\n\nTo test the commercial viability of the ORIA, the WA Government, passed an act of parliament, known as the Northern Development (Ord River) Act, and in October 1960, ratified an agreement with the company Northern Developments, Ord River Pty. Ltd. to set up and run the first \"pilot farm.\" This was backed by the WA Government but was to run as a commercial farming venture.\n\nBy November 1960 the first 200 acres had been chain-dozed and cleared, a channel and pumps were in place, to irrigate the first commercial rice crop that had been planted on the new pilot farm. This was almost three years before the completion of the Ord River Diversion Dam and main channel, so the pilot farm irrigated by pumping water from the Carlton Reach waterhole.\n\nAllocation of commercial farm land during Stage 1 of the project was allocated in stages, with the first group of farmers arriving in 1962 and final allocations completed in 1966. 30 farms produced mostly cotton, however pest problems soon became apparent. The early 1970s saw the application of large amounts of pesticides on crops. The primary pest was the caterpillar Helicoverpa armigera which developed resistance to the pesticides. The resulting low crop yields combined with a drop in world cotton prices led to suspension of the commercial cotton industry in the region.\n\nWork started on the main Ord River Dam in 1969 and was completed before the official opening on 30 June 1972 by Prime Minister William McMahon, when he said..\n\nThis marks the beginning of Ord stage two\n\nThe main Ord River Dam, known locally as \"Top Dam\" holds back the waters of the Ord River in Lake Argyle. The Ord scheme created Lake Argyle, which is Australia's largest dam reservoir, covering an area of 741 km².\nUntil the mid-2010s most reports of the scheme derided its lack of economic return. In 2013, the Wilderness Society estimated that $1.45 billion had been spent on the Ord Irrigation Scheme for a return of 17 cents for every dollar spent. In 2016 the Auditor General for Western Australia reported that \"The sustained social and economic benefits underpinning the decision to proceed with this $529 million investment have not been realised. Nor is there a plan to track and assess them.\" The Australia Institute reported that \"Attempts to develop northern Australia by subsidising capital-intensive industries like irrigated agriculture have a long and unimpressive history. An example is the Ord River Scheme which currently supports just 260 jobs despite $2 billion spent and decades of effort.\". In the late 2010s the possibility of large-scale Chinese investment and the opening of export markets in China gave the Ord Scheme a potential basis for financial sustainability.\n\nThe Ord River dams provide water for irrigation to over 117 km² of farmland and there are plans to extend the scheme to allow irrigation of 440 km² in the near future. The main Ord River dam also generates power for the local community of Kununurra. By 2009 more than 60 different crops were grown in the Ord catchment area. One third of the area is used for sugar cane cultivation. In 2012 the release was approved of an additional 74 km² of Stage 2 Goomig lands for irrigated agriculture, while the same year the West Australian Department of Agriculture conducted soil and water investigations of the Cockatoo Sands (red loamy sands) near the Ord River Irrigation Area, Kununurra. These investigations identified about 65 km² of Cockatoo Sands and about 24 km² of Pago Sands on Carlton Hill Station suitable for fodder or perennial crops. The Cockatoo Sands have great potential because they are well-drained and have capacity to support agriculture throughout the wet season. As part of the Water for Food government program, the Department of Agriculture also investigated an additional 300 km² of Cockatoo soils north of Kununurra for possible expansion.\n\nIn 2009, the Rudd Government and Colin Barnett announced a development plan for the area. The plan emphasised community and infrastructure development including upgrades of Kununurra Airport and the port at Wyndham.\n\nThe Ord River Dam Hydro Scheme is a privately funded, owned and operated power system in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia. It consists of a new 36 MW hydro electric power station at Lake Argyle interconnected, by lengthy 132 kV transmission lines, with existing diesel fuelled power systems at the Argyle diamond mine and the Kununurra township. The scheme can currently only produce 1% of the power the Snowy Mountains Scheme produces. The power station was constructed from 1995 to 1996.\n\nCSIRO research conducted in 2008 found that the water quality in the lower reaches of the river was good and that planned activities were not an ecological threat. Salinity and erosion are also becoming an issue in the area, due to the rising of the water table in the area. The use of groundwater drains has been suggested by hydrologist Dr Tony Smith, as a possible remedy to salinity problems.\n\nSome concerns have been raised that the large body of water created by the dam could attract Asian insects and birds which may transmit dangerous viruses such as avian influenza.\n\nLike so many other experiments in tropical agriculture the scheme initially failed because of difficulties growing crops and attack from pests. Today the irrigated areas successfully produce a variety of fruits and vegetables, with the most recent crop being sandalwood.\n\nAssociated wetland areas have been preserved within the Lakes Argyle and Kununurra Ramsar Site. Ord water quality and flow contributed to the disappearance of the Common Banana Prawn (Rachel Carbonell, \"North Queensland irrigation plan could 'destroy' prawn fisheries in Gulf of Carpentaria, producers warn\", ABC News – 27 March 2014) \nThe site forms part of the Ord Irrigation Area Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for wild birds, especially estrildid finches.\n\nMuch of the produce is exported to South East Asia. Sugar, which was produced from the late 1990s until the end of 2007 in the ORIA was trucked to Wyndham where it was exported to a Korean-owned food manufacturing plant in Surabaya, Indonesia. Fruit and vegetables are sold to domestic markets and are trucked to all capital cities. The ORIA is also home to the largest commercial Indian Sandalwood plantations in the world.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 17, 2002. In the episode, the Simpsons buy a satellite television system, which Bart spends so much time watching that he does not study for an important achievement test. He scores so low that Principal Skinner demotes him to third grade, while Lisa does so well that she is moved up to third grade. The two are placed in the same class and become rivals. During a trip to Capital City, they get separated from their class and are forced to help each other in order to find their classmates.\n\nHomer buys a satellite system with over 500 channels. He and Bart become addicted to it, and Bart does not study at all for an important upcoming achievement test, even as Lisa is spending all her time preparing. Once the test is done, Principal Skinner announces the results at a school assembly. Not only does Bart fail the test and is demoted to the third grade, but Lisa aces the test and gets promoted to the third grade, where they meet their new teacher, Audrey McConnell. Interestingly during class, Bart performs well on tests (having memorized the answers from his previous experience in the third grade), while Lisa has a hard time adjusting to the class. Audrey decides to clamp their desks together after Bart answers a trick question he had seen the previous year, as the teacher thinks Lisa needs Bart's help. Later, Bart gets an A on a map test while Lisa only gets an A–. Bart says that the test was easy and recites all of the answers to Lisa, which he had memorized from last year in third grade (because he claims that the answer key never changes). Lisa proclaims that Bart cheated but the teacher did not hear Bart's recitation and tells Lisa to stop being jealous.\n\nLater, Bart again teases Lisa and they get in a fight and miss the bus heading back to Springfield. The fight brings them out of the parking lot and into the forest. As a result, the two wind up getting lost. Lisa tells Bart she is hurt by his behavior and Bart sounds somewhat apologetic, though he also adds in the interest of full disclosure that he wants to say he is sorry for using Homer's steamroller a while back to crush Lisa's bike, which he then blamed on Gypsies. Back in Springfield, Principal Skinner informs Homer and Marge that Bart and Lisa are missing. They go to Capital City to find them. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa have been confronted by a family of hillbillies, who save them by driving them back to Capital City. Marge is ecstatic on seeing her children safe and sound. Principal Skinner, worried about the effects of placing Bart and Lisa in the same class, suggests that they return to the \"status quo ante\" – both Simpson kids go back to their proper grades.\n\n\"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the fourteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" (2002–03). American singer Tony Bennett is credited as guest starring in the episode, though his lines were taken from archival audio.\n\nThe episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 17, 2002. It was viewed in approximately 7.47 million households that night. \n\nWith a Nielsen rating of 7.0, the episode finished 44th in the ratings for the week of November 11–17, 2002 (tied with new episodes of \"Becker\" and \"Boomtown\"). It was the highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, beating shows such as \"King of the Hill\", \"24\", and \"Malcolm in the Middle\". \n\nOn December 6, 2011, \"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set \"The Simpsons – The Complete Fourteenth Season\". Staff members Al Jean, Tim Long, Ian Maxtone-Graham, John Frink, Kevin Curran, Steven Dean Moore, Mike B. Anderson, and Michael Price participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode.\n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode \"opens with a TV-based segment awfully reminiscent of Season Two's 'Homer Vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment' and doesn’t get much better from there. As usual, we discover a few laughs along the way – particularly when Bart tries to teach mnemonics – but these are less plentiful than I’d like. This ends up as a wholly mediocre episode.\" \n\nAaron Peck of High-Def Digest called the episode \"memorable\".\n\n"}

Prior to 1 January 2011, it was known as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA). The Act is the legislative vehicle for competition law in Australia, and seeks to promote competition, fair trading as well as providing protection for consumers. It is administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and also gives some rights for private action. Schedule 2 of the CCA sets out the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The Federal Court of Australia has the jurisdiction to determine private and public complaints made in regard to contraventions of the Act.\n\nThe Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) is an act of the Parliament of Australia and so its application is limited by section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which sets out the division of powers between the federal and state parliaments. As a result, most of the CCA is drafted to apply only to corporations, thus relying on Section 51(xx). Some parts of the CCA have a broader operation, relying for instance on the telecommunications power (Section 51(v)) or the territories power.\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is applied as state law through the Fair Trading Acts in each Australian State and Territory, to extend the application of the ACL to individuals. The Act exempts the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments from some provisions of the Act. The immunity from the Act does not generally derive to third parties who deal with the government: see \"Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare\". The article: 'Consumer Protection Law in Australia' (LexisNexis 2011) by Ven. Alex Bruce ('Tenpa') was the first Australian text to critically analyze the most extensive changes to consumer protection law embodied within the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.\n\nThe CCA establishes four organisations with a role in administering the Act:\n\nPart IIIA of the CCA deals with third party access to services of facilities of national significance. For example, it covers access to electricity grids or natural gas pipelines. The aim of this part of the act is to encourage competition in upstream or downstream markets.\n\nThis part of the Act allows services to be 'declared' and for parties to negotiate terms and conditions of access. The National Competition Council and the ACCC are both involved in registering agreement and assessing what is fair (to owners, to public, to users). As an alternative to declaring a service, it may be subject to undertakings registered with the ACCC.\n\nThe restrictive trade practices, or antitrust, provisions in the CCA are aimed at deterring practices by firms which are anti-competitive in that they restrict free competition. This part of the act is enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC can litigate in the Federal Court of Australia, and seek pecuniary penalties of up to $10 million from corporations and $500,000 from individuals. Private actions for compensation may also be available.\n\nThese provisions prohibit:\n\nA priority of ACCC enforcement action in recent years has been cartels. The ACCC has in place an immunity policy, which grants immunity from prosecution to the first party in a cartel to provide information to the ACCC allowing it to prosecute. This policy recognizes the difficulty in gaining information/evidence about price-fixing behaviours.\n\nPart IVB allows the Australian government to prescribe Industry Codes, and breach of these codes is a breach of the Act. The ACCC administers ongoing compliance with these codes. There are currently three codes made under this part:\n\nA unique feature of the Competition and Consumer Act, which does not exist in similar legislation overseas, is that the ACCC may grant exemptions. The ACCC may grant immunity based on assessment of the public benefits and anti-competitive detriments of the conduct, through the 'notification' or 'authorisation' process. Such exemptions do not apply to resale price maintenance or misuse of market power. The ACCC maintains a public register of authorisations and notifications.\n\nIn 2006 the Act was amended to include a new Division 3 to Part VIIA providing a process for formal clearance and authorisation of mergers.\n\nPart VIIA enables the ACCC to examine the prices of selected goods and services in the Australian economy.\n\nThe ACCC's functions under this part are:\n\nAustralia is a free market economy; consequently, the Act does not establish the ACCC as a price-fixing body. An example of the use of this section is that, under a direction from the Minister, the ACCC monitors the price of petrol. However, the ACCC cannot set the price of petrol, which has led to complaints that the ACCC is a \"toothless watchdog\".\n\nPart IX allows the Australian Competition Tribunal, established in Part III of the Act, to review certain decisions of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\nPart X provides immunities for liner shipping from the competition provisions of the Act contained in Part IV. Upon registration of agreements with the registrar of liner shipping, shipping operators may discuss and fix prices, pool revenues and losses, coordinate schedules and engange in other conduct that would otherwise breach Part IV provisions.\n\nThe Act also regulates aspects of the Telecommunications market. In Australia the previously government-owned Telstra, now privatised, has traditionally dominated the telecommunications sector. Telstra owns the copper network infrastructure.\n\nThe market was partially deregulated in 1992 with the introduction of Optus as a competitor. In 1997 deregulation continued when new entities were permitted to enter the market (see Communications in Australia). However, a feature of the Australian telecommunications market is that it is neither feasible nor efficient to have multiple networks, for example, of fibre-optic cables or of copper cables. For this reason, sections XIB and XIC of the Act exist to ensure that competitors (downstream users) have access to Telstra's networks.\n\nPart XIB of the Act allows the ACCC to issue a Competition Notice to a carrier (telecommunications corporation) if it has reason to believe the corporation has engaged in \"\"anti-competitive conduct\"\". \"Anti-competitive conduct\" refers to the restrictive trade practices in Part IV of the Act (Sections 45, 45B, 46, 47 or 48), or when a carrier with a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications market has taken advantage of the power with the effect, or likely effect, of substantially lessening competition.\n\nIf the conduct continues after the issue of the Competition Notice, the ACCC can seek an injunction and financial penalty through the Federal Court. Competition Notices also allow third parties to take legal action.\n\nPart XIC is a telecommunications-specific access regime. The object of Part XIC is to promote the long-term interests of end-users of telecommunications carriage services and services that facilitate the supply of such carriage services: s152AB. The extent to which something promotes the long-term interests of end-users is assessed by having regard to three, and only three, objectives, namely:\n\n\nUnder Part XIC, the ACCC can 'declare' particular telecommunications carriage services if it is in the long-term interests of end-users: s152AL. Suppliers of declared services must comply with standard access obligations: s152AR.\n\nPersons can obtain access to declared services on terms and conditions set either:\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is based on the proposition that low consumer power or lack of information is a market failure which needs to be addressed by interference in the market.\n\nThese parts deal with:\n\nMisleading or deceptive conduct (s 18 of the ACL, formerly s 52 of the TPA) is one of the most important consumer parts of the act. It allows both individuals and the ACCC to take action against corporations who engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.\n\nMisleading or deceptive conduct carried out by companies can also be prosecuted by the state (under Chapter 4 of the ACL).\n\nThe inclusion of unconscionable conduct in the Australian Consumer Law is a codification and extension of the equitable principle of 'unconscionability' which was later clarified as a cause-of-action. The High Court of Australia held that an act was unconscionable if a party to a transaction is under a 'special disability', the other party is or ought be aware of that disability, and that other party acts in a way that makes it unfair or unconscionable to accept the offer of the weaker party.\n\nSection 20 codifies the common law by referring to the \"unwritten law\" (i.e. the common law). However, the inclusion of section 20 allows for remedies under the Law.\n\nSection 21 bans unconscionability in consumer transactions. Section 22 gives factors that indicate unconscionability. This clarifies the application of unconscionability and circumstances where a consumer is at a \"special disability\".\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law also prohibits a range of other unfair practices including bait advertising (advertising a product that is not reasonably available), pyramid schemes (Division 3 of Part 3-1 of the ACL, formerly Division 1AAA of Part IV of the TPA), and certain misrepresentations (e.g. a misrepresentation as to price).\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law implies into contracts with consumers certain guarantees (these were formerly known as warranties). Similar conditions are implied by the State Sale of Goods Acts, but these acts have slightly different jurisdictional limits (e.g. 'consumer' and 'goods') and the legislative phrases may have been interpreted slightly differently.\n\nUnder the Trade Practices Act implied conditions and warranties are mandatory: they cannot be excluded by a contractual intent to the contrary. The implied conditions are as to title (s 53 of the ACL, formerly s 69 of the TPA), quiet possession, freedom from encumbrances, fitness for purpose (s 55 of the ACL, formerly s 71 of the TPA), supply by description or sample (s 56, s 57) and that the goods are of acceptable quality (s 54 of the ACL, formerly s 66 of the TPA, which used the term \"merchantable quality\"). As a caveat, where the consumer guarantees are not that of title, undisturbed possession or undisclosed securities, they only apply if the goods or services in question are supplied in trade or commerce.\n\nThe most important of these to a consumer is likely to be acceptable quality. If goods or services fail to reach a basic level of quality (considering the price of the goods/services) – that is they are defective, break, or do not do what they should do – then the ACL has been breached.\n\nThe Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act (Dawson Report) was released in January 2003 and received 212 submissions. The scope of the report was quite broad, with recommendations regarding mergers and acquisitions, exclusionary provisions, third line forcing, joint ventures, penalties and remedies, and the functions and powers of the ACCC. As a result, some amendments have been made to the Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The poem \"The Chimney Sweeper\" is set against the dark background of child labour that was prominent in England in the late 18th and 19th century. At the age of four and five, boys were sold to clean chimneys, due to their small size. These children were oppressed and had a diminutive existence that was socially accepted at the time. Children in this field of work were often unfed and poorly clothed. In most cases, these children died from either falling through the chimneys or from lung damage and other horrible diseases from breathing in the soot. In the earlier poem, a young chimney sweeper recounts a dream by one of his fellows, in which an angel rescues the boys from coffins and takes them to a sunny meadow; in the later poem, an apparently adult speaker encounters a child chimney sweeper abandoned in the snow while his parents are at church or possibly even suffered death where church is referring to being with God.\n\nThe poem from \"Songs of Experience\" was set to music in 1965 by Benjamin Britten as part of his song cycle \"Songs and Proverbs of William Blake\".\n\n\"The Chimney Sweeper\" (from \"Songs of Innocence\")\n\"The Chimney Sweeper\" (from \"Songs of Experience\")\nIn 'The Chimney Sweeper' of Innocence, Blake can be interpreted to criticise the view of the Church that through work and hardship, reward in the next life would be attained; this results in an acceptance of exploitation observed in the closing lines 'if all do their duty they need not fear harm.' Blake uses this poem to highlight the dangers of an innocent, naive view, demonstrating how this allows the societal abuse of child labour.\n\nIn Experience, 'The Chimney Sweeper' further explores this flawed perception of child labour in a corrupt society. The poem shows how the Church's teachings of suffering and hardship in this life in order to attain heaven are damaging, and 'make up a heaven' of the child's suffering, justifying it as holy. The original questioner of the child ('Where are thy father and mother'?) offers no help or solution to the child, demonstrating the impact these corrupt teachings have had on society as a whole.\n\nScholars agree that the \"of Innocence\" poem \"The Chimney Sweeper\" is the 12th object in the order of the original printings of the \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" and the \"of Experience\" version of the poem was 37th in the publication order.

The poem talks about merry sounds and images which accompany the children playing outdoors. Then, an old man happily remembers when he enjoyed playing with his friends during his own childhood. The last stanza depicts the little ones being weary when the sun has descended and going to their mother to rest after playing many games.\n\nThe poem follows the structure of a day— 'the sun does arise' in the beginning of the first verse, and 'the sun does descend' in the middle of the third stanza, and can be read as a metaphor for human life. The poem is the contrast of innocence and experience, but also the contrast between perception of joys and sorrows. What is happening on the Green will happen again, shown by the 'old folk' who watch the children and reminisce about their own childhood on the Green.

{"id": "1899565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899565", "title": "Hedenbergite", "text": "Hedenbergite\n\nHedenbergite, CaFeSiO, is the iron rich end member of the pyroxene group having a monoclinic crystal system. The mineral is extremely rarely found as a pure substance, and usually has to be synthesized in a lab. It was named in 1819 after M.A. Ludwig Hedenberg, who was the first to define hedenbergite as a mineral. Contact metamorphic rocks high in iron are the primary geologic setting for hedenbergite. This mineral is unique because it can be found in chondrites and skarns (calc–silicate metamorphic rocks). Since it is a member of the pyroxene family, there is a great deal of interest in its importance to general geologic processes.\n\nHedenbergite has a number of specific properties. Its hardness is usually between five and six with two cleavage plains and conchoidal fracture. Color varies between black, greenish black, and dark brown with a resinous luster. Hedenbergite is a part of a pyroxene solid solution chain consisting of diopside and augite, and is the iron rich end member. One of the best indicators that you have located hedenbergite is the radiating prisms with a monoclinic crystal system. Hedenbergite is found primarily in metamorphic rocks.\n\nThe pyroxene quadrilateral easily records the compositions of different pyroxene's contained in igneous rocks, such as diopside, hedenbergite, enstatite, ferrosilite. Hedenbergite is almost never found isolated. From the chemical formulas above, we can tell that the main differences in the compositions will be in terms of calcium, magnesium, and iron. D. H. Lindsley and J. L. Munoz (1969) did such an experiment in order to figure out exactly which combinations of temperature and pressure will cause particular minerals to combine. According to their experiment, at 1000 degrees with a pressure less than two kilobars the stable composition is a mixture of hedenbergite, olivine, and quartz. When the pressure moves to twenty kilobars, the composition moves towards the clinopyroxenes, which contains trace amounts of hedenbergite if any. For temperatures of 750 degrees Celsius, the compositions move from hedenbergite with olivine and quartz to ferrosilite with a greater amount of hedenbergite. If you combine the results of both of these sets of data, you can see that the stability of hedenbergite is more dependent on temperature as opposed to pressure.\nPyroxenes are essential to the geologic processes that occur in the mantle and transition zones. One crystal was oriented with the C axis, and another perpendicular to the C axis. The elastic strength of a polyhedron is determined by the cation occupying the central site. As the bond length of the cations and anions decreases the bond strength increases making the mineral more compact and dense. Substitution between ions like Ca and Mg would not have a great effect on the resistance to compression while substitution of Si would make it much harder to compress. Si would be inherently stronger than Ca due to the larger charge and electronegativity.\n\nChondrites are meteorites that have experienced very little alteration by melting or differentiation since the formation of the solar system 4.56 billion years ago. One of the most studied chondrites in existence is the Allende meteorite. Hedenbergite was found to be the most abundant secondary calcium-rich silicate phase within Allende chondules and is closely associated with other minerals such as sodalite and nepheline. Kimura and Ikeda (1995) also suggest that hedenbergite formation may have been the result of the consumption of CaO and SiO as plagioclases decomposed into sodalite and nepheline as well as alkali-calcium exchange before the condrules' incorporation into the parent body.\n\nHedenbergite can be found in skarns. A skarn is a metamorphic rock that is formed by the chemical alterations of the original minerals by hydrothermal causes. They are formed by large chemical reactions between adjacent lithologies. The Nickel Plate gold skarn deposit of the Hedley District in southern British Columbia is characterized by hedenbergitic pyroxene.\n\n"}
{"id": "1899567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899567", "title": "Long Clawson", "text": "Long Clawson\n\nLong Clawson is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Clawson, Hose and Harby, in the Melton district, in the county of Leicestershire, England. Situated in the Vale of Belvoir, the village is surrounded by farmland with rich soil ideal for pasture. Milk from local dairy farms is used for production of Stilton cheese, of which the Long Clawson dairy is one of the largest producers. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 664.\n\nThere is some debate about the origin of the village's name; one theory is that there were once two villages named Clawson and Claxton, which grew together and became Long Clawson. The \"Long\" part of the name may have arisen from it being over in length, although the main road through the village has 14 sharp bends.\n\nThe village is featured in the 1086 Domesday Book as \"Clachestone\", but there is evidence of much earlier settlements. Embedded into the tarmac footpath against the wall of the Manor House is an ancient megalith. The Long Clawson Stone is approximately 3 feet long and allegedly a fragment of a larger ancient stone. The Manor House itself has an ancient fish pond that is still stocked. On 1 April 1936 it was merged with Harby and Hose to form \"Clawson and Harby\" (now called \"Clawson, Hose and Harby\").\n\nLike many larger village settlements, the number of businesses in the village has declined in recent years. Once possessing five pubs, numerous small stores and traders, along with its own police presence, the village now only has one pub, the \"Crown and Plough\"] and a few shops. The community is strong and thriving, however, with a growing population. Around 100 new houses were built in the village in the early part of the 21st century and the primary school has doubled the number of its pupils.\n\nA traditional saying about Long Clawson and Hose (a nearby smaller village) is \"There are more whores in Hose than honest women in Long Clawson\"; this is thought to contain puns on the village names and items of clothing.\n\nThe village churches include the Anglican church of St Remigius, a Methodist church, and a Baptist church dating from 1845). The last two are 20th-century red brick buildings. The former Primitive Methodist chapel of 1868 is now a private residence.\n\nThe parish church of Saint Remigius dates from around the 14th century. Its walls, like those of the nearby manor house, are of a local stone rich red in hue. It contains a medieval effigy of the crusader William Bozon. The church was restored in 1893 and seats 300.\n\nThe present Methodist Church was opened in 1956. Methodism was introduced into the village by a Mrs Hind through her contact with the Wesleyan Society in 1797. After joining a small society at Nether Broughton, she formed a society in Long Clawson, meetings being held in the kitchen of her home. Later a licence was obtained and William Parkes's home was registered for public worship. It became known as 'The Consecrated Barn'. The first chapel was built in 1801 and in 1816 improved by the addition of a gallery. In 1840 a new chapel was built on the present site at a cost of £1100. In 1873 a schoolroom and a Minister's vestry were added. A manse was built alongside the chapel in 1887. In 1954 the chapel burnt down. A committee was formed to raise funds for a replacement and on 25 June 1955 the foundation stone for the new building was laid. The new chapel opened on 29 September 1956.\n\nOne of only six dairies in England where Stilton cheese is manufactured, Long Clawson Dairy was founded in 1911 by 12 farmers from the Vale of Belvoir. The company has prospered and today is supplied by over 40 farms, all within Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire, as the Protected Designation of Origin for Stilton requires.\n\nIts supplier farms range in production between 350,000 and over 4 million litres of milk per year. The dairy employs about 200 people and makes an annual 6,700 tonnes of cheese in 60 varieties. Exports account for about 20 per cent of its sales, which amounted to some £54 million in 2008.\n\nLong Clawson Dairy was awarded a total of 11 trophies at the International Cheese Awards 2011, which took place at the Nantwich Show in Cheshire, including Reserve Champion UK and Reserve Supreme Champion for the dairy's 'Blue Stilton'.\n\nThe village has a recently restored windmill that dominates the skyline from the south. The mill, located at Mill Farm, has a characteristic Lincolnshire-style cap (white painted ogee-shaped) and is a Grade II listed building.\n\n"}

Lindley, who placed a single species, \"P. tuberosum\", in it. Lindley believed that this species was identical with one identified in 1781 as \"Echites succulenta\", which would make \"Pachypodium\" a taxonomical synonym of \"Echites\".\n\nLindley's new genus did not immediately gain broad acceptance; in 1937, George Don gave precedence to the genus Echites in naming two species that had been classified in both that genus and Pachypodium; he assigned only one species, \"P. tomentosum\", to the Pachypodium genus. In 1844, however, Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle placed several species in the genus. More were added in 1867 and 1871, when \"P. namaguanum\" and \"P. Lealii\", respectively, were added.\n\nIn 1882, John Gilbert Baker identified the first species of the genus from Madagascar, \"P. rosulatum\". Several more species from Madagascar followed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe first monograph on Pachypodium was published in 1907 by Julien Constantin and Georges Bois. It listed 17 species in the genus, 10 from Madagascar and 7 from central Africa. 20 species were listed in 1934, of which 14 were from Madagascar and only 6 from central Africa. By 1976, the number had returned to 17, with 12 of those being from Madagascar and 5 from central Africa.\n\nSeveral new species were added in the 1990s, and several classifications previously reduced to synonym or subspecies were elevated to the status of distinct species. \n\n"}

The river forms most of the boundary between the states of São Paulo and Paraná.\n\nFrom source to mouth the Paranapanema River has an elevation drop of . The river's length is about . It flows generally west, reaching the Paraná River at an altitude of about .\n\nThe sources of the river are protected by the Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park, created in 2012.\nThe sources are situated in the Serra Agudos Grandes, in south-central São Paulo, approximately from the Atlantic coast.\n\nFrom the sources to the mouth of the Itararé River, the Paranapaneba flows within the territory of São Paulo state. Below the Itararé the Paranapanema forms the border between the states of Paraná and São Paulo.\n\nThe river is associated with a date according to State Law 10.488/99 (Antônio Salim Curiati), sanctioned by Governor Mário Covas, designated as August 27.\n\nThe Paranapanema is the least polluted river of the state of São Paulo.\n\nThe average total gradient of the Paranapanema River, from its sources to its mouth in the Paraná river is 61 cm/km, not considering the first 100 km, where the river descends from the Serra of Paranapiacaba, at an average gradient of 43 cm/km, a value relatively low for a stream with a length of 929 km.\n\nThe Paranapanema river may be divided into three principal stretches:\n\nFrom its mouth at the Paraná River, to the Grande Falls, a length of 421 km, the average gradient is 29 cm/km. There are widths of more than 200 m, deeper and shallower stretches, widths that reach nearly 800 m. The radii of curvature are in the order of 1.000 m. The course is more or less meandering presenting a complete horizontal equilibrium, with an excess, only of the stretch close to the junction with the Paraná river, where one may notice the existence of moving sand-banks and islands.\n\nFrom the Grande Falls up to the confluence with the Apiaí-Guaçu River, with a length of 328 km, the river descends a total of 210 m. It is not possible to calculate an average gradient on this stretch, because due to the construction of various dams for the provisioning of hydroelectric power, the level will fall abruptly at those dams.\n\nThe Upper Paranapanema reaches from the confluence of the Apiaí-Guaçu River to the river's sources in the Serra de Agudos Grandes, with a length of 180 km. The average gradient is quite high, 150 cm/km. It drains a series of streams that descend from the Serra of Paranapiacaba, the Upper Paranapanema is gaining size and consolidates to receive the Itapetininga River and Apiaí-Guaçu river.\n\nNavigation of the Paranapanema River is practical along the lower course up to the port of Euclides da Cunha, down the chute of the Coroa do Frade, with a length of about 70 km, counting from the mouth into the Paraná river. Navigation is fairly hazardous. Under normal conditions the minimum depth of this stretch may be estimated at about .\n\nFor the last 421 km downstream, the course between the mouth and the dam of Salto Grande, the average gradient is an about 29 cm/km.\n\nThe main natural obstacles that interrupt or make navigation dangerous are: a basalt bank, hidden rocks, reduced current velocity, too little depth, a straight canal in the middle of the river, an elevated current velocity, an undulating movement, a sinuous canal, sand banks, and stretches with high gradient.\n\nThe great reserves of water held in the Paranapanema's reservoirs have considerable influence on the regime of the river in its middle course. In the lower course the influence is reduced, with no effect on the natural conditions that completely impede navigation.\n\nThe Paranapanema River has in total eight dams and their respective reservoirs. The following table traces a list going in the direction of the Paraná River.\n"}

It is sited at Rukuhia, which was the name of the Royal New Zealand Air Force base on that site during World War II.\n\nIn the year to 30 June 2011 the airport had 316,000 domestic and 46,000 international passengers. In 2017/18 there were 353,000 passengers, all domestic, 54% of them to Wellington and 37% to Christchurch. Hamilton is the eleventh-busiest airport in New Zealand by passenger traffic.\n\nThe airport is on land owned by Samuel Steele (brother of William Steele, who brought militia-settlers from Sydney to Hamilton in 1864) from about 1880. By 1929 there was a landing ground on the farm, though a site close to the city was also considered. In 1935 Steele's aerodrome was sold for expansion into an airport and opened by the mayor on 12 October.\n\nAs the world prepared for war, it became clear that a landing strip needed to be constructed in the Hamilton area. By 1935, the air strip was already in service, as a stopover for military aircraft that would land after a long journey. Services provided refueling as well as food and rest for the incoming pilots.\n\nTravel by air began to blossom soon after the war was over, and, in 1950, the airport received its first commercial flight. The main runway was sealed in 1965, and turboprop flights began to Hamilton that year, with NAC's Fokker Friendship aircraft operating. The runway was further lengthened to accommodate Vickers Viscount, 1970, and ultimately Boeing 737 aircraft types in 1975.\n\nIn 1989, the New Zealand government sold the airport to councils representing Hamilton City (50 per cent), Waikato District (15.625 per cent), Waipa District (15.625 per cent), Matamata-Piako District (15.625 per cent) and Ōtorohanga District (3.125 per cent). This development led to unprecedented growth for the airport.\n\nAnsett New Zealand built an independent passenger terminal to the south of the main building, equipping it with a 'Golden Wing Club' lounge and food vending machines. The airline's \"Ansett NZ\" division operated flights to Wellington from Hamilton from 1995 until 2000, when Ansett NZ was sold to a New Zealand business consortium and rebranded Qantas NZ, with their own New Zealand domestic flights division. \"Qantas NZ\" operated at the airport until 2001, when it went into receivership. The terminal was then occupied by Origin Pacific airlines. This airline operated domestic services until it too went bankrupt in 2004. The small terminal was then left unused.\n\nIn 1998, Hamilton Airport Motor Inn was developed to cater for travellers using the airport.\n\nA NZ$15.3 million terminal expansion begun in 2005 featured a 60 per cent increase in floorspace with improved baggage handling areas, better international and domestic check-in space, and passenger security screening. It was completed in late 2007.\n\nHugh McCarroll was the airport's chief executive from the early 2000s until retirement in February 2006. The current chief executive is Chris Doak, formerly growth and development general manager for electricity utilities company WEL Networks.\n\nIn 1994, the airport became a terminal for Trans Tasman air routes, with charter flights provided on Boeing 727s by Kiwi Travel International Airlines (not to be confused with the United States-based Kiwi International Air Lines) which served Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. New Zealand's Kiwi went bankrupt in 1996, but by that time Freedom Air had begun flying the same routes with Boeing 737 aircraft. They also, briefly, operated flights to Nadi, Fiji, in 2005. Freedom Air ultimately decided to make Hamilton International Airport their company hub until parent company Air New Zealand closed the airline down on 30 March 2008 operating its own full service instead. By then, the Airbus A320 was being operated. When passenger numbers dropped to an unsustainable level in August 2009, Air New Zealand ceased services to Australia. Virgin Australia attempted to fill the need for a trans Tasman service later that year with twice-weekly Boeing 737-800 flights to Brisbane; however, passenger numbers remained low and Virgin Australia ended flights on 27 October 2012. No further international flights have been made from the airport since that date.\n\nHamilton Airport is home to the New Zealand Training Centre of L3Harris Airline Academy. L3Harris Airline Academy is the British flight training division of L3Harris that provides freshly trained airline pilots to numerous airlines throughout the world, mainly within the United Kingdom, most notably EasyJet, and also including British Airways, Qatar, Flybe, Thomson, Oman and, formerly, Thomas Cook and Monarch Airlines among others.\nMost of the non-passenger traffic at this airport is generated by L3Harris training flights, in single-engined Diamond DA20 and Cessna 172, and twin-engined Diamond DA42 Twin Star aircraft.\n\nThe Waikato Aero Club has been based at Hamilton Airport since 1933. The club provides a full range of flight training from recreational flying in Light Sport Aircraft through to commercial Multi-Engine IFR.\n\nThe airport currently accommodates many different types of aircraft, from piston-engined light aircraft to commercial turboprop aircraft such as the ATR 72. The airport can handle all light business jets as well as 40-to-80-seat regional jets such as the Embraer E195 and Bombardier CRJ200. Several airliners can operate from the airport including the 100-200 seat Boeing 737, Boeing 757 and Airbus A320. The largest aircraft authorised to land at Hamilton is the 150-to-250-seat Boeing 767. Plans to increase runway length from 2,195m to 3,000m to attract larger aircraft and start Asian regional flights, have been considered.\n\nThe airport operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nIn August 2011, approval was received by Hamilton International Airport to extend its runway up to 3,000 metres—the same size as secondary airports in other parts of the world, such as the Gold Coast. It will finish before 15 years' approval ends.\n\nThe airport has a single terminal building and 6 tarmac gates. The apron is capable of accommodating up to five A320/737-800 aircraft at once.\n\n\n"}

Tensions dissipated, but the truce was short-lived.\n\nOn 17 May 1992 the two leading government parties announced that although they supported the constitutional amendment, they also favoured transitional clauses that would permit Suchinda to serve as prime minister for the term of the parliament. It became clear the government parties would not honour their word, and plans went ahead for a strike on Sunday, 17 May.\n\nObviously concerned about the people's mounting anger, the interior minister ordered provincial governors to prevent people from travelling to Bangkok to join the rally. Suchinda threatened to sack the governor of Bangkok for allegedly assisting the anti-government rallies of the previous week, while the army hastily arranged a competing \"Anti-Drought Musical Festival\" to be held at the Army Auditorium. Radio stations were banned from playing recordings by several popular singers who had voiced their support for the demonstrations.\n\nNevertheless, the rally was the biggest since the downfall of the Thanom regime in October 1973. At its peak, 200,000 people filled Sanam Luang, overflowing onto the encircling streets. At about 20:30, Chamlong Srimuang, Sudarat Keyuraphan, and Dr. San Hatthirat led the protesters on a two-kilometre march to the Government House to demand Suchinda's resignation. As they reached the intersection of Rachadamnoen and Rachadamnoen Nok Avenues, they were halted at Phan Fa Bridge, which had been barricaded with razor wire by the police. At 23:00 a group of demonstrators attempted to break through the barricade, but were repulsed by water cannons from four fire trucks blocking the way. The protesters then tried to commandeer one of the fire trucks, but were beaten back by riot police armed with batons. Protesters replied with stones and Molotov cocktails. Chamlong used a loudspeaker to urge the marchers not to attack the police, but his words were ignored. In this initial clash, about 100 protesters and 21 policemen were injured.\n\nBy midnight two fire engines had been set on fire, and the situation was spiralling out of control. Some 700 troops had been called in and the fighting fanned out from Phan Fa Bridge. At 00:30 Suchinda declared a state of emergency, making gatherings of more than ten persons illegal. The government urged people to go home. Hospitals in the area were already receiving the injured, including four with gunshot wounds who died that night. Chamlong remained near Phan Fa Bridge and nearby Democracy Monument. At about 04:00, soldiers threatened the nearly 40,000 protesters by firing M16 rifles into the air. An hour and a half later, they began firing again. By the morning, the army brought in more troops, and crowds grew larger in other sections of the city.\n\nEarly on the afternoon of 18 May, Suchinda publicly accused Chamlong of fomenting violence and defended the government's use of force. Shortly thereafter, troops firing continuously in the air moved in to surround Chamlong. He was handcuffed and arrested.\n\nHowever, the crowds still did not disperse, and violence escalated. When government troops secured the area around Phan Fa Bridge and Democracy Monument, protests shifted to Ramkhamhaeng University in the east of the city. By the evening of 19 May, about 50,000 people had gathered there.\n\nEarly on the morning of 20 May, Princess Sirindhorn addressed the country on television, calling for an end to the violence. Her appeal was rebroadcast throughout the day. That evening, her brother, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, broadcast a similar appeal.\n\nFinally, at 21:30, a television broadcast of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Suchinda, and Chamlong was shown, in which the King demanded that the two men put an end to their confrontation and work together through parliamentary procedures. In the broadcast, the King addressed the two generals:\n\nThe Nation belongs to everyone, not one or two specific people. The problems exist because we don't talk to each other and resolve them together. The problems arise from 'bloodthirstiness'. People can lose their minds when they resort to violence. Eventually, they don't know why they fight each other and what the problems they need to resolve are. They merely know that they must overcome each other and they must be the only winner. This no way leads to victory, but only danger. There will only be losers, only the losers. Those who confront each other will all be the losers. And the loser of the losers will be the Nation... For what purpose are you telling yourself that you're the winner when you're standing upon the ruins and debris?\n\nSuchinda then released Chamlong and announced an amnesty for protesters. He also agreed to support an amendment requiring the prime minister to be elected. Chamlong asked the demonstrators to disperse, which they did. On 24 May 1992, Suchinda resigned as Prime Minister of Thailand.\n\nThe front page of the \"International Herald Tribune\"'s 20 May 1992 issue was blacked out with felt tip pen, as was an editorial of the \"Bangkok Post\" of the same date, though other articles relating to the demonstrations remained untouched. The English-language newspaper \"The Nation\" and two Thai-language newspapers were shut down on 21 May though the order was rescinded a few hours later.\n\nThe violence resulted in 39 reported deaths, hundreds of injuries, and many disappearances. Security forces \"...intentionally fired on and killed many unarmed demonstrators and inflicted savage and gratuitous beating on hundreds of others.\" Over 3,500 people were arrested.\n\nA House of Representatives Special Committee and a fact-finding committee led by Sophon Rattanakorn shared the same conclusion: the government of General Suchinda used excessive force to crack down on the rally. Some facts from the investigation, such as names of military officers and military units responsible for rounding up, killing, and torturing of protesters were revealed to the public. It is believed these facts were recorded in the report of the Ministry of Defense's Fact Finding Committee led by General Pichit Kullawanit, but it is still kept from the Thai public. The military constitution of 1992 remained in place until 1997, when a replacement was drafted and promulgated.\n\nChamlong later apologized for his role in the events: \"I wanted a peaceful rally,\" he said. \"I can't deny some responsibility for the damage and loss of life. I feel deeply sorry for those families whose members were killed in the incident, for those people who were injured and their families.\" Nevertheless, he noted, \"We were right in what we have done.\" He then retired from politics, eventually to return during the protests against the government of Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nSuchinda was later appointed chairman of Telecom Asia (today known as True Corporation), a company which received a concession to install two million telephone lines in Bangkok during the Anand government. Anand later became Chairman of Saha-Union Group, which had received an independent power producer concession during his government.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1899610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899610", "title": "Heulandite", "text": "Heulandite\n\nHeulandite is the name of a series of tecto-silicate minerals of the zeolite group. Prior to 1997, heulandite was recognized as a mineral species, but a reclassification in 1997 by the International Mineralogical Association changed it to a series name, with the mineral species being named:\nHeulandite-Ca, the most common of these, is a hydrous calcium and aluminium silicate, (Ca,Na)Al(Al,Si)SiO·12HO. Small amounts of sodium and potassium are usually present replacing part of the calcium. Strontium replaces calcium in the heulandite-Sr variety. The appropriate species name depends on the dominant element. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name heulandite is still used whenever testing has not been performed.\n\nCrystals are monoclinic. They may have a characteristic coffin-shaped habit, but may also form simple rhombic prisms. Frequently, a crust of fine crystals will form with only the ends of the rhombs visible, making the crystals look like wedges. They have a perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of symmetry, on which the lustre is markedly pearly; on other faces the lustre is of the vitreous type. The mineral is usually colourless or white, but may be orange, brown, yellow, brick-red, or green due to inclusions of celadonite. It varies from transparent to translucent. Isomorphous with heulandite is the strontium and barium zeolite brewsterite.\n\nThe Mohs hardness is 3-4, and the specific gravity 2.2. Heulandite is similar to stilbite. The two minerals may, however, be readily distinguished by the fact that in heulandite the acute positive bisectrix of the optic axes emerges perpendicular to the cleavage. \nHeulandite was first separated from stilbite by August Breithaupt in 1818, and named by him \"euzeolite\" (meaning beautiful zeolite); independently, in 1822, H. J. Brooke arrived at the same result, giving the name heulandite, after the mineral collector, John Henry Heuland (1778–1856).\n\nHeulandite occurs with stilbite and other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic volcanic rocks, and occasionally in gneiss and hydrothermal veins.\n\nGood specimens have been found in the basalts of Berufjörður, near Djúpivogur, in Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Deccan Traps of the Sahyadri Mountains of Maharashtra near Mumbai. Crystals of a brick-red colour are from Campsie Fells in Stirlingshire and the Fassa valley in Trentino. A variety known as beaumontite occurs as small yellow crystals on syenitic schist near Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the best examples of Italian modern and contemporary architecture.\n\nThe house was conceived around 1937 by the well-known Italian architect Adalberto Libera for Curzio Malaparte. Malaparte actually rejected Libera's design and built the home himself with the help of Adolfo Amitrano, a local stonemason.\n\nCasa Malaparte is a red masonry box with reverse pyramidal stairs leading to the roof patio. On the roof is a freestanding curving white wall of increasing height. It sits on a dangerous cliff 32 metres above the sea overlooking the Gulf of Salerno. Access to this private property is either by foot from the town of Capri or by boat and a staircase cut into the cliff. Casa Malaparte's interior and exterior (particularly the rooftop patio) are prominently featured in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film, \"Contempt\" (\"Le Mépris\").\nThe house entrance access was carved itself through the outside staircase in its center but the owner bricked the entrance and moved it to the side of the house in 1940.\nCasa Malaparte was abandoned and neglected after the death of Curzio Malaparte in 1957. It suffered from vandalism and natural elements for many years and was seriously damaged, including the desecration of a cocklestove, before the first serious renovation started in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The building was donated to the Giorgio Ronchi Foundation in 1972.\n\nMalaparte's great-nephew, Niccolò Rositani, is primarily responsible for restoring the house to a livable state. Much of the original furniture is still there, because it is too large to remove. The marble sunken tub in the bedroom of his mistress still exists and functions. His bedroom and book lined study are still intact. Many Italian industrialists have donated materials for the preservation.\n\nToday the house is used for serious study and cultural events.\n\nThe house can only be reached by traversing the island. The last twenty-minute walk is over private property, belonging to the Giorgio Ronchi Foundation. It takes an hour and a half to walk there from Capri's Piazzetta at the summit of the funicular from the Marina Grande. The house can be reached by sea, on calm days only, as the waves are cast upon treacherous rocks and there has not been an official pier for many years. From the sea, one must climb 99 steps to reach the house. Malaparte gave his friend and boatman money to open a restaurant which is run by the boatman's son today. It is the only restaurant one would pass on the path from the Piazzetta to the promontory where Tiberius built his palace, Villa Jovis.\n\nThe book \"Malaparte: Casa come me\" (A House Like Me) edited by Michael McDonough, includes drawings and essays by many prominent artists and architects, such as James Wines, Tom Wolfe, Robert Venturi, Emilio Ambasz, Ettore Sottsass, Michael Graves, Willem Dafoe, Peter Eisenman, Wiel Arets and many other luminaries of arts and letters.\n\n\n"}

He was the Grand Admiral (Kapudan Pasha) in command of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, where he was killed in action. He also served as the governor of Egypt from 1563 to 1566.\n\nHe was the son of a muezzin of possible Albanian descent, hence his epithet \"Müezzinzade\" (\"son of a muezzin\"). He was a favorite of Sultan Selim II and of the women of the seraglio who admired his voice as a muezzin, and he married one of Selim II's daughters.\n\nFrom 1563 to 1566, Ali Pasha served as the Ottoman governor of Egypt. He was reportedly a very ascetic Sufi man, wearing only \"coarse woolen clothes\" and paying many visits to the tombs of saints in the City of the Dead necropolis in Cairo.\n\nAli Pasha, with a fleet eventually numbering 188 galleys, fustas, transports and other ships, carried the main land force, commanded by Lala Mustafa Pasha, for the Ottoman invasion and conquest of Cyprus from Constantinople on 16 May 1570 to Cyprus, where they landed on 3 July. While Lala Mustafa commanded the eventual capture of the island from Venice, Ali Pasha took the bulk of his fleet to Crete and then to Morea, thereby effectively preventing any Christian relief fleet from coming to the aid of the besieged defenders of Cyprus.\n\nAli Pasha was commander-in-chief of the Ottoman naval forces at the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571. Selim had entrusted him with one of the most precious possessions of the Ottoman Sultans, the great \"Banner of the Caliphs\", a huge green banner heavily embroidered with texts from the Qur'an and with the name of Allah emblazoned upon it 28,900 times in golden letters. It was intended to provide an incentive for him and his men to do their best in battle.\n\nAli Pasha was more of a land soldier than a naval tactician, and his failure to keep his lines together and keep his individual squadrons from charging like cavalry units in a land battle allowed the Christian forces to penetrate his battle line in various places and to surround and defeat the isolated ships. He was also somewhat of a firebrand and almost immediately sought the direct confrontation with his opposite number. His flagship, the galley \"Sultana\", battled head-to-head with Don Juan's flagship \"La Real\", was boarded and, after about one hour of bloody fighting, with reinforcements being provided to both sides by other galleys in their respective fleets, was captured. In the ensuing battle, Ali Pasha was slain and his head was then displayed upon a pike. This, and the capture of the Banner of the Caliphs by \"La Real\", led to a collapse in Turkish morale, greatly contributing to their rout in the battle.\n\n\n"}

Foraker of Ohio placed McKinley's name in nomination.\n\nThe convention was originally slated for the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall. However it was determined that repairs and upgrading the Hall could not be done in time and so a temporary wood convention hall was built in 60 days at a cost of $60,000 on the lawn south of City Hall which was under construction. At the conclusion of the convention, both the temporary building as well as the original Exposition Hall were torn down and a new Coliseum was built.\n\nThe 1896 Convention was held in St. Louis less than a month after the infamous 1896 tornado that devastated a large swath of the city and killed at least 255 people. There was speculation that it might be unfeasible to hold the convention in the city, but, after a concerted cleanup effort was undertaken, the convention went ahead as planned.\n\nThe Republican platform of 1896 favored the gold standard but left the door open to free coinage of silver, it also supported acquisition of Hawaii and parts of the Danish West Indies, favored a canal across Central America, naval expansion, sympathized with revolutionaries in Cuba and Armenia, wanted exclusion of all illiterate immigrants, applauded gains in women's rights and pledged \"equal pay for equal work\". It also supported creation of a \"National Board of Arbitration\".\n\nComing into the convention, former Vice President Levi P. Morton had strong support to re-take his former office from delegates who favored the gold standard.

He also played football for his hometown club Bradford City.\n\nBorn in Bradford, Yorkshire, Bairstow excelled at school in several sports, and he played football several times for Bradford City, but eventually he settled on cricket, and played his first county match against Gloucestershire in 1970 after taking an A-level at 6am in order to play.\n\nHe played for Yorkshire throughout his career, and captained the club from 1984 to 1986, though this was a far from happy period. Nicknamed \"Bluey\" on account of his red hair, influential for his aggression on the field and for his playing statistics. He was particularly well loved by the Yorkshire crowds for his ability to turn round limited over games by his late-order swinging of the bat. In 459 first-class cricket matches he scored 13,961 runs at an average of 26.44 with a highest score of 145. He snared 961 catches and 137 stumpings and perhaps stands second only to Jimmy Binks in the annals of Yorkshire wicket-keeping.

He was a popular figure with the Yorkshire crowds.\n\nHe played four Test matches for England, though was usually behind first Bob Taylor and later Paul Downton in the selectors' minds. He had more opportunities in One Day Internationals on the strength of his batting in domestic cricket - he made ten first-class centuries - but consistently failed to break through, and never scored more than 23 in his twenty ODI innings.\n\nHe played for Griqualand West, during the winters of 1976 and 1977, appearing rather surprisingly as a seam bowler on two occasions and taking 3–82 against Transvaal B.\n\nAfter retirement from playing in 1990, Bairstow became a popular radio commentator. However, he engaged in arguments with the Yorkshire management, and also suffered from depression. In late 1997, Bairstow took an overdose of tablets, and although he survived, a few weeks later he hanged himself at his home in Marton-cum-Grafton, Yorkshire. The coroner in the case recorded an open verdict, saying that he was not convinced Bairstow had meant to kill himself, and that his actions may instead have been a \"cry for help\". His wife, Janet, and children, Andy (22), Jonathan (8) and Becky, soon left Marton-cum-Grafton and moved to Dunnington.\n\nHis son from his second marriage, Jonny, went on to play as wicket-keeper and batsman for both Yorkshire and England. Jonny's chosen squad number, 51, is a tribute to his father's birth year. His son from his first marriage, Andrew, played first-class cricket fleetingly for Derbyshire.\n\n"}

{"id": "1899702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899702", "title": "Friends Provident Trophy", "text": "Friends Provident Trophy\n\nThe Friends Provident Trophy was a one-day cricket competition in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt was one of the four tournaments in which the eighteen first-class counties competed each season. They were joined by teams from Scotland and Ireland. Lancashire won the title a record seven times.\n\nThe competition has previously been known as the C&G Trophy (2000–2006), the NatWest Trophy (1981–2000) and the Gillette Cup (1963–1980). For a short period following the 2006 season, the competition was known as the ECB One-Day Trophy because no sponsors were forthcoming when Cheltenham and Gloucester decided to end their association with the competition after the 2006 season. The tournament, along with the Pro40 forty-overs competition, was replaced by the ECB 40 competition from the 2010 season.\n\nIt was the first top level one day competition to be introduced in English and Welsh cricket, amid concern about falling attendances at County Championship matches in the early 1960s.\n\nThe competition was based on the Midlands Counties Knockout Cup experiment of 1962, when Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire played one-innings-a-side matches which each lasted one day. The MCC decided to hold a limited over competition (65 overs-a-side) the following year for all first-class counties sponsored by American safety razor company Gillette. The original title was \"The First Class Knock Out Competition for the Gillette Cup\".\n\nThe first match (which was also retrospectively identified as the first List A cricket match after that designation was developed), was a Preliminary Round match on 1 May 1963 at Old Trafford, Manchester with Lancashire facing Leicestershire. The match ended up lasting two days due to rain. Peter Marner scored the first century and Brian Statham was the first bowler to take 5 wickets in a match.\n\nSussex were the first winners of the Gillette Cup beating Worcestershire in the final at Lord's. Norman Gifford was the very first \"Man of the Match\" for a final.\n\nIn the inaugural season the matches were 65 overs per side, with a bowler bowling a maximum of 15 overs. In 1964, this was reduced to 60 overs with a bowler bowling a maximum of 13. For the 1966 competition until 1998 the maximum was 12.\n\nMinor Counties teams first competed in the 1964 season. The competition became seen as a cricketing version of football's FA Cup with Minor Counties, Ireland and Scotland playing against the First Class Counties in the first round. Most times the established teams beat the part-timers but very occasionally there was some \"giant killing\". Between 1963 and 2005 there were 15 \"upsets\", including: Durham (at that time still a minor county) being the first in 1973 v Yorkshire; Hertfordshire being successful on two occasions, beating Essex in 1976, and winning a bowl-out versus Derbyshire in 1991; and Herefordshire overcoming a Middlesex side featuring Andrew Strauss in 2001. However, the majority of the time it was an opportunity for county sides to score very high scores against or bowl out cheaply Minor Counties opposition.\n\nOne of the most famous matches in the competition was the 1971 Gillette Cup semi final at Old Trafford, with David Hughes of Lancashire coming out to bat at 8.45 pm (before any floodlights) and scoring 24 in one over to beat Gloucestershire. That Lancashire team won the tournament three seasons in a row from 1970 to 1972.\n\nIn June 1973, Durham became the first minor county to defeat a first class county in the competition, when they beat Yorkshire by six wickets in round one. They then became the first minor county to defeat two first class counties, when they defeated Derbyshire at the same stage in 1985. This was the catalyst for the successful campaign that saw Durham gain first class status in 1991.\n\nIn 1981, the National Westminster Bank took over the sponsorship of the competition from Gillette. That year's final finished in a tie, with both sides scored 235. Derbyshire claiming the trophy from Northamptonshire by losing fewer wickets (Derbyshire 6 to Northants 9).\n\nThe tournament was always the more prestigious of the two \"full length\" one day cup competitions. The other was the Benson & Hedges Cup, which was abolished in 2002 and replaced with the Twenty20 Cup.\n\nIn 1999 the number of overs was cut to 50 per side to give English and Welsh cricketers more experience of playing matches the same length as One Day Internationals. In line with One Day International cricket, teams played in coloured clothing from 2005.\n\nThe competition was revised into a league format from 2006. The eighteen English and Welsh first-class sides, plus Scotland and Ireland, were split into two groups of ten by geographical location known as the North and South Conferences. Matches were 50 overs per side, gaining two points for a win, one point for a no result and no points for a loss. Once the league positions were decided, the top teams from each Conference competed for the trophy in a final at Lord's. In the 2007 season this involved a semi-final knock-out stage, the winner in each conference playing the runners-up in the other.\n\nThe league structure was revised in 2008 as the twenty teams were split into four groups of five. Each team plays the other in the group home once and away once, with the top 2 counties in the group going into the quarter finals.\n\nThe competition was played in the first half of the cricket season with the final taking place in August. The other main domestic one-day competition, the Natwest Pro40 League (formerly \"Sunday League\"), was latterly played during the second half of the season.\n\nIn August 2009, the ECB announced that from 2010 there would be one 40-overs per innings tournament replacing both the Pro40 and the Friends Provident Trophy. This along with the English County Championship and the Friends Provident t20 (a revised form of the Twenty20 Cup), would be English cricket's three domestic competitions.\n\nGillette Cup\nNatWest Trophy\nC&G Trophy\nFriends Provident Trophy\n\nFirst class counties with no wins: Glamorgan and Leicestershire\n\n\n\n"}

On 16 February 1942, Imperial Japanese soldiers machine-gunned 22 Australian Army nurses and 60 Australian and British soldiers and crew members who had survived the sinking of by Japanese bombers. South Australian nurse Sister Lt Vivian Bullwinkel and two soldiers were the sole survivors.\n\nNot reported to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 nor included in subsequent re-tellings was the rape of the nurses before they were killed massacre. This was uncovered by research in 2019.\n\nOn 12 February 1942 the royal yacht of Sarawak left Singapore just before the city fell to the Imperial Japanese Army. The ship carried many injured service personnel and 65 nurses of the Australian Army Nursing Service from the 2/13th Australian General Hospital, as well as civilian men, women and children. The ship was bombed by Japanese aircraft and sank. Two nurses were killed in the bombing; the rest were scattered among the rescue boats to wash up on different parts of Bangka Island. About 100 survivors reunited near Radji Beach at Bangka Island in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), including 22 of the original 65 nurses. Once it was discovered the Japanese held the island, an officer of the \"Vyner Brooke\" went to surrender the group to the authorities in Muntok. While he was away army matron Irene Melville Drummond, the most senior of the nurses, suggested the civilian women and children should leave for Muntok, which they did. The nurses stayed to care for the wounded. They set up a shelter with a large Red Cross sign on it.\n\nAt mid-morning the ship’s officer returned with about 20 Japanese soldiers. They ordered all the wounded men capable of walking to travel around a headland. The nurses heard a quick succession of shots before the Japanese soldiers came back, sat down in front of the women and cleaned their bayonets and rifles. A Japanese officer ordered the remaining 22 nurses and one civilian woman to walk into the surf. A machine gun was set up on the beach and when the women were waist deep, they were machine-gunned. All but Bullwinkel were killed. Wounded soldiers left on stretchers were then bayoneted and killed.\n\nShot in the diaphragm, Bullwinkel lay motionless in the water until the sound of troops had disappeared. She crawled into the bush and lay unconscious for several days. When she awoke, she encountered Private Patrick Kingsley, a wounded British soldier from the ship who had survived being bayoneted by the Japanese soldiers. She dressed his wounds and her own, then 12 days later they surrendered to the Japanese. Kingsley died before reaching a POW camp, but Bullwinkel spent three years in one.\n\nBullwinkel survived the war and gave evidence of the massacre at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal) in 1947. \n\nRecent evidence collected by historian Lynette Silver, broadcaster Tess Lawrence and biographer Barbara Angell, indicates that most of the nurses were raped before they were murdered. However, Bullwinkel was not permitted to speak about the rapes after the war, saying that she had been \"gagged\" by the Australian government. According to the Australian government, the perpetrators of the massacre remain unknown and \"escaped any punishment for their crime\".\n\nIn South Australia an annual commemoration known as the Bangka Day Memorial Service has been held at the Women's Memorial Playing Fields, St Mary's on the Sunday closest to 16 February since 1955. A plaque commemorating the South Australian Army Nursing Sisters who died, including Drummond and six others was erected at the site.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1899710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899710", "title": "Dirtsurfing", "text": "Dirtsurfing\n\nDirtsurfing is the sport of riding a Dirtsurfer brand inline board. This new Australian boardsport is correctly known as inline boarding because Dirtsurfer is a trademark protected brand name.\n\nA Dirtsurfer is composed of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.\nAnother feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.\n\nInline Boarding was made an official race class by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and Gravity Sports International (GSI) in 2005. The 2005 IGSA World Cup Champion inline boarder is Nihat Uysal of Germany. Nihat rides the Silver GP-X (see below)\n\nThe first board was designated the GP (general purpose) and was available in black, red and blue colour options.\nInitially it was sold without brakes, which were later made standard as an addition to the existing frame, and utilised a retro fit \"calf lever\" operating system.\nA Limited Edition model was made of the GP, which offered a silver anodized frame, V rim wheels and a signed certificate and number.\n\nThe next board made available was the GP-X, which came with a silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, disc brake caliper lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use.\n\nTwo alternative versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, called the Road Racer, used the same frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres.\nThe other was a UK specific beach racer model, with sealed bearing hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres.\n\nIn 2003, Dirtsurfer introduced the Flexideck, a newer concept with an epoxy/fibreglass/maple composite deck connecting the front and rear frame to absorb jumps. Made available in powder coated lime green frame with purple anodized V rims, and disc brake as standard, it offered greatly increased ground clearance and a reinforced frame for jumping.\n\nDirtsurfer has updated their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16 inch wheels. Both models feature the new adjustable metal calf brake lever, rear disc brake, and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. The new 16\" GP comes in white, with the new braking lever and disk brakes. The new GP 20\" come in black and also has the new braking handle and disk brakes.\n\nA unique feature of the Dirtsurfer is that it emulates the feel of carving as on a snowboard. This is achieved by the front wheel being mounted to a single pivoting point, allowing the axle of the wheel to be above the board. Think of the idea as being very similar to riding a bike that does not have handlebars and cannot independently create speed. A Dirtsurfer comes with a leg operated brake, either as a disc or a V-Brake as used on many bicycles.\n\nThe Dirtsurfer will never experience a speed wobble normally associated with other bikes or board sports. Because all of the weight is below the hub of the wheel and pulls down on the hub as opposed to pushing down actually changes physics.\n\nThe Dirtsurfer can be used as a downhill sport on or off-road, using just the power of gravity. The Dirtsurfer may also be \"skated\" in flat areas. \"Skating\" the Dirtsurfer means to push yourself forward with one foot while standing on the Dirtsurfer with the other foot the way you would a skateboard. Many Dirtsurfer riders also use a kite, sail or a kitewing, sometimes called wingsurfing to propel the Dirtsurfer in flat areas with adequate wind.\n\nThis discipline is similar to mountain biking, where the Dirtsurfer is ridden off-road down varying grades of tracks, from forest roads to technical singletrack.\n\nMany Dirtsurfer riders enjoy the fluid feel of carving down long asphalt roads, usually found in mountainous areas. High speeds at over 70 mph have been achieved, with riders limited only by turns in the road and their own sanity (and, to a lesser extent, speed limits). Boards are often modified with slick tyres for this purpose. Riders are often found wearing motorcycle leathers and full face helmets to try to prevent road rash in the event of an accident. An international race circuit has been growing since 2001 with major events held annually in Canada, the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Austria.\n\nDirtsurfing with a kite or kitewing is called wingsurfing and is performed on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields. Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks that would otherwise require a massive ramp. It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction. However, it is possible, using the power of a kite or kitewing, to tack and gybe, much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction. Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming to the end of a run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from \"heel-side\" to \"toe-side\". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your heels, point towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you. This is not as difficult as it sounds. Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40 mph on a flat surface.\n\n"}

It is a tributary of the Canadian River, draining an area of in a watershed that includes parts of northeastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. \n\nA portion of the river flowing through Oklahoma City was renamed the Oklahoma River in 2004. \n\nThe North Canadian River is formed by the confluence of the Beaver River and Wolf Creek, northeast of the town of Fort Supply in Woodward County, Oklahoma. It flows generally eastward and southeastward, through Woodward, Major, Dewey, Blaine, Canadian, Oklahoma, Lincoln, Pottawatomie, Seminole, Hughes, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, and McIntosh counties, through the cities and towns of Woodward, Oklahoma City, and Shawnee. It is dammed near Canton to form Canton Lake in Blaine County, and in Oklahoma City to form Lake Overholser. It flows into the Canadian River in McIntosh County as part of Lake Eufaula, which is formed by a dam on the Canadian River.\n\nA portion of the river flowing through Oklahoma City was renamed the Oklahoma River in 2004. This portion has several locks that have created a series of small lakes in which rowing, kayaking, and canoeing regattas take place (hosted by the Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation, Chesapeake Boat House, and Oklahoma City University). Regatta activities include: 2.5 mile head races, 2000 meter sprints, and 500 meter sprints. It is the only location in the US conducting officially sanctioned night sprints under lights. The Oklahoma River was profiled in \"The New York Times\" on April 22, 2008.\n\nThe name \"North Canadian River\" has sometimes been applied to the Beaver River and one of the Beaver River's headwaters tributaries, Corrumpa Creek, extending the North Canadian River's length into New Mexico and Texas. The U.S. federal government used that definition from 1914 to 1970: A 1914 decision by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) defined the North Canadian River as including both the Beaver River and Corrumpa Creek as part of its course. A 1970 USBGN decision revised the 1914 definition, defining the North Canadian River as beginning at the confluence of the Beaver River and Wolf Creek. The USBGN's Geographic Names Information System lists \"Beaver Creek,\" \"Beaver River,\" \"Branche Nord de la Riviere Canadienne,\" \"Honih'hiyo'he,\" \"North Fork Canadian River,\" and \"North Fork of Canadian River\" as historical variant names for the river.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1899714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899714", "title": "Ángel Botello", "text": "Ángel Botello\n\nÁngel Botello never attached to any particular artistic school or movement and was a protean artist: he developed his own artistic style. Botello was a versatile and many-sided artist who worked in all artistic media at his reach: oil paintings, drawing, printmaking, bronze sculptures, wood carving, photography and mosaics.\n\nAngel Botello was born in the small town of Cangas do Morrazo in Galicia, in the northwestern region of Spain. Botello was one of six children (four girls and two boys) of Angel Botello y Suárez, a businessman in the fish canning industry and Bonis Barros y del Amo. Botello's father died in 1918 after contracting the Spanish influenza. In the 1920s and, after the bankruptcy of the family business, his mother and siblings moved to Bordeaux, France, and lived there until 1935. While in France, Botello's mother wanted Angel to become a farmer but he wanted to be an architect. In France, architecture is considered a fine art rather than a science and students must take art courses. Botello and his younger brother Manuel studied during four years at the École des Beaux-Arts, from which they graduated with honors and where they excelled in drawing, painting and modeling.\n\nIn 1935 Botello returned to Spain where he applied and was accepted with a scholarship at the School of Art of the San Fernando Academy in Madrid. The few paintings that remain of the young Botello's work in France and Spain reflect an immediate break from his strictly academic training to the impressionist and post-impressionist concepts and techniques that shaped his development.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War started in 1936, which made him leave his studies and join the Republican Army as a cartographer. He fought in the Spanish Civil War together with his brother Manuel, who died in the war field. In 1939, the Spanish Civil War ended with a victory for General Francisco Franco which made it impossible to stay in Spain, Botello eventually returned to France to meet with his family who were in a refugee camp.\n\nThe family decided to leave Europe and move to the Dominican Republic where he was warmly received. The community of Dominican artists included him as one of their own and many of the paintings created at this time were presented at the \"\"Latin American Art Exposition\"\" at the Riverside Museum in 1940.\n\nDuring that year, the Botello family traveled to Cuba, where they stayed for eight months. Upon their return to Santo Domingo, his paintings were noted by the Peruvian ambassador there who invited Botello to show them in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 1944. After his arriving to Haiti, Botello met Christiane Auguste, who became his wife and artistic manager. After his marriage, Botello changed his artistic plans to move to Mexico to meet with the greatest Mexican artist Diego Rivera and stayed in Haiti. Botello became increasingly recognized and critically acclaimed. His Haitian landscapes and figure studies are considered to be some of his best works. In Haiti, Botello developed his artistic career of woodworking.\n\nFor ten years, the Botello family lived in Haiti until 1953 when they moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where they would reside permanently. By this time, he already had gained international recognition in the world of plastic arts.\n\nA painting by Botello entitled 'Mother and Child' featured on an episode of Discovery Channel's Auction Kings during the show's second series achieving a price of $17,000.\n\nAfter the Botello family left Haiti and arrived in Puerto Rico in 1953, they opened their first art gallery at the Caribe Hilton Hotel. Later, they established a second art gallery in Old San Juan. Botello stated that the light and bright colors of the tropics opened a new world for him and stimulated his creativity. From the 1960s until his death in 1986 his work became more personal, as it was enriched by his new favorite theme: his three children. The deep love that he felt for his children and his family is reflected in his later paintings and sculptures.\n\nIn 1959, Botello traveled to Ravenna, Italy to learn about the mosaic technique and produced some mosaics but quickly abandoned the technique, convinced that he had mastered it.\n\nIn the 1960s, Botello became interested in printmaking after an art dealer reproduced some of his paintings using this technique. Botello refused to sign these reproductions because he was not consulted and had not worked personally on the final production of the prints. For that reason, Botello traveled to Paris, France and learned printmaking techniques. He became a master in printmaking and graphic design. Some of his best printmaking works are his linocuts, lithographs and serigraphs.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Botello started a double artistic career in painting and sculpture.\n\nIn 1985, Ángel Botello, who was a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer and knowing that his life was in danger, then accelerated his artistic production pace and never surrendered to his illness. In the last year of his life, at age 73, Botello produced the incredible amount of 22 bronze sculptures in large format.\n\nThe 33 years that Botello lived in Puerto Rico are considered the most prolific period in his artistic career, in terms of the quality of his paintings and sculptures and the quantity of artwork produced and art media used. This artistic period of Botello in Puerto Rico has a strong figurative and surrealist influence and is the period that brought most recognition to the artist. His works of this period are known in Puerto Rico as the \"Botellian Style\", recognized by his caricature figures, especially girls.\n\nÁngel Botello died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 11, 1986 leaving behind an impressive legacy of oil paintings, lithographs, linocuts, serigraphs and bronze sculptures. His former house located at Old San Juan, Puerto Rico now is an art gallery where his paintings, sculptures and artwork of other outstanding Puerto Rican and international artists are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also studied NWA referee Tommy Young in order to hone his mannerisms as a referee. His professional wrestling career began when he joined the Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF) as a photographer in 1995. After being used as a special guest referee in 1995, he later became a full-time referee for the PWF.\n\nRobinson repeatedly petitioned the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) professional wrestling promotion for a job. On September 15, 1997, he was given a tryout match, refereeing a dark match between Chris Adams and Kendall Windham before \"WCW Monday Nitro\" at Independence Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. A few weeks following the match, Robinson was contacted by WCW and signed to a contract. His first appearance was during the WCW TV tapings at Universal Studios in Orlando Florida.\n\nIn 1999, Robinson became the heel referee of the Four Horsemen, aligning himself with Flair. Robinson frequently favored the Horsemen in the matches he officiated, enraging Randy Savage. Savage, who had been suspended by Flair (then the WCW President), proposed a match between his girlfriend, Gorgeous George, and Robinson, with Savage to be reinstated if George defeated Robinson. The match, which marked Robinson's wrestling debut, took place at Slamboree 1999 on May 9, 1999. Robinson, dubbed \"Little Naitch\" (a reference to Flair's nickname, the \"Nature Boy\"), came to the ring in a robe similar to those worn by Flair, and mimicked Flair's mannerisms, signature strut and \"wooo\" catchphrase. Robinson emulated Flair throughout the match, using Flair's customary illegal tactics, but was defeated by George, who pinned him following a diving elbow drop. Robinson wrestled his second match one week later, teaming with Flair to face Randy Savage and Madusa on an episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". In the course of the match, Savage delivered a botched diving elbow drop to Robinson, cracking several of his vertebrae and collapsing his lung. After undergoing treatment, Robinson returned to WCW television several weeks later, and was appointed to President Flair's stable. Flair and Piper kayfabe ran WCW until they were unseated by Sting, with Robinson returning to his refereeing duties.\n\nRobinson would again turn heel in the Fall of 1999, this time siding with Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner. Robinson would get involved in matches he was refereeing for Vicious and Steiner. This would go on for a month before Robinson would go back to being an unbiased Referee. In 2000, Robinson appeared in the WCW-produced film \"Ready to Rumble\". On March 26, 2001 on \"Nitro\", Robinson refereed the last WCW match ever, where Sting defeated Ric Flair via submission.\n\nWhen WCW's properties were purchased by the World Wrestling Federation from AOL Time Warner in March 2001, Robinson was hired by the WWF. He debuted in the WWF as a member of The Alliance, bickering with WWF loyalist referee Jack Doan and accompanying senior WCW official Nick Patrick to ringside for his match at WWF Invasion on July 22, 2001. He refereed his first WWF match on July 2, 2001. Despite being a member of the Alliance, Robinson, unlike fellow Alliance member Nick Patrick, was mostly a fair and impartial referee. An example of this would be the August 20, 2001 episode of \"Raw\" when he awarded Tajiri a victory over Booker T by disqualification when Booker T started choking Tajiri with his shirt. The night before at Summerslam, Robinson refereed Booker T's match against the Rock and called the match right down the middle as the Rock won the WCW Championship.\n\nIn 2002, the WWF was renamed \"World Wrestling Entertainment\", and the roster was divided between two \"brands\", \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\". Robinson was initially assigned to \"Raw\", but was later traded to \"SmackDown!\", where he refereed many women's matches. On the July 1, 2004, episode of \"SmackDown!\", Robinson was forced to wrestle Luther Reigns by General Manager Kurt Angle. The match, however, was quickly stopped by Charlie Haas.\nAt No Mercy 2006, Robinson, who had refereed a match between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker, was on the receiving end of a Tombstone Piledriver from the Undertaker after he had called for him to be disqualified after hitting Mr. Kennedy with his WWE United States Championship belt. Robinson also officiated the World Heavyweight Championship matches at WrestleMania 22, WrestleMania 23, as well as Ric Flair's final WWE match and the last part of the World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV. Two years later he refereed the main event of WrestleMania XXVI, the retirement match of Shawn Michaels.\n\nOn the June 20, 2008, episode of \"SmackDown\", Robinson was placed in a match by General Manager Vickie Guerrero after ejecting Chavo Guerrero from ringside during Bam Neely's match with Matt Hardy. He lost to The Great Khali in a squash match. After the match he was carried out by medical officials. He returned in a match between Edge and The Big Show, where he stopped Big Show from giving a con-chair-to to Edge. In November 2008 referees were made no longer exclusive to certain brands. Robinson has worked the final matches of Eddie Guerrero, Edge, & Shawn Michaels, as well as Ric Flair's WWE retirement match at WrestleMania XXIV. He also refereed Triple H's successful victory against Sting at Wrestlemania 31. This was Sting's first match in WWE, and Sting personally chose Robinson as the referee. Robinson also refereed the match between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker at SummerSlam where the match ended in controversy after Undertaker tapped out to Lesnar. Even though Robinson didn't see Undertaker tapping, the timekeeper saw it and rang the bell. Undertaker then hit Lesnar with a low blow and made Lesnar pass out to Hell's Gate. In a post-match backstage interview, Robinson admitted that, after watching the replays, Undertaker did tap out, but he also confirmed that it didn't matter if the timekeeper or the crowd saw it, and that as long as Robinson didn't call for the bell, the match would continue, due to him being the referee and the official. At Payback on May 1, 2016, he refereed the match between Charlotte (with her father Ric Flair) and Natalya (with Bret Hart) for the WWE Women's Championship. During the match, Robinson called for the bell when Charlotte had Natalya in the sharpshooter despite Natalya not submitting. This was similar to the Montreal Screwjob of Survivor Series 1997, when Bret Hart lost the WWF Championship. Robinson was one of the referees assigned to the inaugural WWE Cruiserweight Classic.\n\nSince 2002, Robinson has been a part of the WWE production and ring crew, helping assemble and disassemble the ring and set before and after shows.\n\nHe once had his elbow knocked out of its socket while refereeing a match in the PWF in Gastonia, North Carolina. Fire Breaker Chip accidentally kicked Charles' elbow during a pin attempt. He was out of action for 4 months.\n\nOn April 18, 2014, while traveling with the WWE in Saudi Arabia, Robinson suffered a freak accident while helping assemble the wrestling ring, resulting in him nearly losing his thumb. The injury required six stitches.\n\nOn January 29, 2017 during the Royal Rumble PPV, Robinson was refereeing the WWE Championship Match between John Cena and AJ Styles when he tore the plantar fasciitis on his left foot seven minutes into the match. He completed the match, but was subsequently out of action for two months, during which he underwent successful surgery. He returned on March 25, 2017 during a WWE SmackDown Live house show in Johnson City. He made his television return on the March 28, 2017 episode of 205 Live.\n\nOn the July 11, 2017 episode of \"SmackDown\", Robinson's left index finger was mildly fractured by Baron Corbin while he refereed Corbin's match against Shinsuke Nakamura.\n\nRobinson's likeness appears as the referee in THQ's \"WWE 12\", \"WWE 13\", and 2K Sports \"WWE 2K14\", \"WWE 2K15\" and \"WWE 2K16\".\n\nOn October 11, 2000, Robinson married a woman named Amy, who was diagnosed with melanoma of the lung in January 2001 and died on April 7, 2002. He has a daughter named Jessica from a previous relationship. He is a Christian.\n\n"}

They can be found from tropical lowland forests to montane rainforests. A few species grow as terrestrials or even as lithophytes in open, humid habitats. The genera Bolborchis , Hologyne and Ptychogyne are generally included here. The genus is abbreviated Coel. in trade journals.\n\nThe name \"Coelogyne\" was first published as \"Caelogyne\" in 1921 by John Lindley. and is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"κοῖλος\" (\"koîlos\", hollow) and \"γῠνή\" (\"gunḗ\", woman), referring to the concave stigma.\n\nA few species are commonly known as \"necklace orchids\", because of their long, pendant, multi-flowered inflorescence.\n\nThis genus lacks the saccate base of the labellum, a typical characteristic which is present in the other genera in the subtribe Coelogyninae. The free lip has high lateral lobes along the basal part of the labellum (hypochile) and smooth, toothed or warty keels.\n\nThe pseudobulbs of one internode vary in size. They may be closely or widely spaced through sympodial growth along the rhizome.\n\nInflorescences often show a small to very large number of showy, medium-sized to large flowers. They may arise either from the apex of the newly completed pseudobulb at the end of the growing season (as in \"Coelogyne fimbriata\"), or may precede the new growth in early spring (as in \"Coelogyne cristata\"). The typical colour range of this genus is white, through tawny brown to green, and occasionally peachy tones. All species have four pollinia.\n\nThey have often a sweet scent, attracting different kinds of pollinators, such as bees, wasps and beetles.\n\nThe cooler growing species such as \"Coelogyne fimbriata\", \"Coelogyne ovalis\", \"Colegyne fuliginosa\", \"Coelogyne cristata\", \"Coelogyne flaccida\", \"Coelogyne nitida\" originate in the Himalayan region of India and southeast Asia. \n\nThe traditional taxonomy of the genus \"Coelogyne\" is still disputed. \"Coelogyne\" has been subdivided in 23 sections or subgenera by De Vogel (1994) and Clayton. Molecular data show that \"Coelogyne\" is paraphyletic and should be reorganised. It should include the genera \"Neogyna\" and \"Pholidota\", and several sections should be removed, including \"Cyathogyne\", \"Tomentosae\", \"Rigidiformes\", \"Veitchiae\" and \"Verrucosae\". This new genus \"Coelogyne\" should then contain about 160 species.\n\nThe type species is \"Coelogyne cristata\".\n\nThe database IPNI gives 415 entries for this genus, but a large number are invalid or have become synonyms. These are not mentioned in the following traditional list.\n\n\n\"Coelogyne\" hybrids include:\n\nThe wide distribution of this genus has resulted in a wide variety of temperature requirements from species to species, some requiring cool to cold conditions to grow and bloom reliably, while others need decidedly warmer temperatures to achieve the same.\n\nThe orchids in this genus require a decided rest period during winter in which they receive no feed, very little water (enough to prevent pseudobulbs shrivelling), cool to cold temperatures and high light. These conditions seem to aid flowering in spring for some growers, though others report that more constant conditions can also produce regular flowering.\n\n"}

The river drains Lake Matagami and travels north-west before emptying into Rupert Bay at the south end of James Bay. Its drainage basin is and has a mean discharge of 1190 m³/s (1556 yd³/s). Its source is the head of the Mégiscane River, which is from the mouth.\n\nSignificant lakes along its course are Soscumica Lake () and Dusaux Lake ().\n\nThe Nottaway, together with the Broadback and Rupert Rivers, was initially considered to be dammed and developed as part of the James Bay Project. But in 1972 hydro-electric development began on the more northerly La Grande and Eastmain Rivers, and the NBR Project was shelved. With the decision to divert the Rupert River to the La Grande, it is not likely that the Nottaway will be developed in the foreseeable future.\n\nNottaway means the lower course of Lake Matagami and a length of , of a watercourse which originates in the Mégiscane Lake. The whole is a long river of units flowing through many lakes. On the way to the northwest, the Nottaway, from Lake Matagami, creates the lakes of Soscumica and Dusaux, collects the waters of several rivers - notably the Kitchigama River and ends its race in Rupert Bay at the southern end of James Bay, at the western area of the Broadback River and Rupert River.\n\nIts drainage basin is and has an average discharge of . The course of the river crosses many marsh areas, especially in its lower part.\n\nThe mouth of Matagami Lake is located:\n\nFrom the mouth of Matagami Lake, the Nottaway River flows on divided into the following segments:\n\nUpper part of Nottaway River (segment of )\n\n\nLower part of Nottaway River (segment of )\n\n\nThe confluence of the Nottaway River is located at:\nLemoine Island, Lavoie Island, Kakupanchish Island, Kaminahikushach Island, Misiministikw Island, D'Herbomez Island, Des Sept Miles Island, Interdite Island (Bras Kapakusipastikuch), Vandry Island (Bras Spipastikw), Desmolier Island, Michikushish Island, Nestipuku Island, Kauskatistin Island.\n\nRapides Kanutinitunanuch, rapides Kasischischiskasich, rapides Kaikunapischechuch, rapides Kachechekuch, Iroquois Falls, rapides Longs, rapides des Taureaux.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the Iroquois invaded the Algonquin territory near James Bay along this river. So when European cartographers started to map the river in the late seventeenth century, they called it \"\"Rivière des Iroquois\"\" (Iroquois River), as shown on maps of Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin in 1699, Guillaume Delisle in 1703, and Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1744.\n\nYet various forms of \"Nottaway\" started to appear in the early 18th century. \"Noddaways\" in 1715, \"Nodaway\" in 1743, \"Nodaoay\" and \"Nodway\" in 1744. Geologists James Richardson and Albert Peter Low used \"Notaway River\" in their reports (of 1880 and 1885 respectively). The current spelling \"Nottaway\" was established in the early twentieth century. It is believed to have come from the Algonquin word \"nadowe\", meaning \"snake\" and which the Algonquin tribes used to identify or describe their enemies, including the Iroquois. The Cree called this river \"Natuweu Nipi\", and the Iroquois name was \"Nottaweou\".\nMajor tributaries of the Nottaway River include:\n\n"}
{"id": "1899743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899743", "title": "Albert Grossman", "text": "Albert Grossman\n\nAlbert Bernard Grossman (May 21, 1926 – January 25, 1986) was an American entrepreneur and manager in the American folk music scene and rock and roll. He was famous as the manager of many of the most popular and successful performers of folk and folk-rock music, including Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Band, Odetta, Gordon Lightfoot and Ian & Sylvia.\n\nAlbert Grossman was born in Chicago on May 21, 1926, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants who worked as tailors. He attended Lane Technical High School and graduated from Roosevelt University, Chicago, with a degree in economics.\n\nAfter university he worked for the Chicago Housing Authority, leaving in the late 1950s to go into the club business. Seeing folk star Bob Gibson perform at the Off Beat Room in 1956 prompted Grossman's idea of a 'listening room' to showcase Gibson and other talent, as the American folk-music revival movement grew. The result was the Gate of Horn in the basement of the Rice Hotel, where Jim (later Roger) McGuinn began his career as a 12-string guitarist. Grossman moved into managing some of the acts who appeared at his club — including an eighteen-year-old Joan Baez, who got her first major break with him — and in 1959 he joined forces with George Wein, who had founded the Newport Jazz Festival, to start up the Newport Folk Festival. At the first Newport Folk Festival, Grossman told \"The New York Times\" critic Robert Shelton: \"The American public is like Sleeping Beauty, waiting to be kissed awake by the prince of folk music.\"\n\nBecause Grossman was committed to commercial success for his clients, and was frequently surrounded by socialist enthusiasts of the American folk-music revival, his manner could generate hostility. This hostility is illustrated by this description of Grossman's presence in the Greenwich Village folk scene by Dylan biographer and critic Michael Gray: \"He was a pudgy man with derisive eyes, with a regular table at Gerde's Folk City from which he surveyed the scene in silence, and many people loathed him. In a milieu of New Left reformers and folkie idealists campaigning for a better world, Albert Grossman was a breadhead, seen to move serenely and with deadly purpose like a barracuda circling shoals of fish.\"\n\nIn 1961, Grossman put together Mary Travers, Noel Stookey, and Peter Yarrow as the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. They quickly achieved success when their eponymous first album entered the Billboard Top Ten in 1962. The group had been avidly pursued by Atlantic Records, who were on the verge of signing them when the deal inexplicably fell through. The group signed with Warner Bros. Records instead and Atlantic's executives later discovered that it was because music publisher Artie Mogull had introduced Grossman to Warner executive Herman Starr, from whom Grossman was able to extract an unprecedented deal that gave the trio complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music. Over the course of his career, Grossman's client list included Todd Rundgren, Odetta, Peter, Paul and Mary, John Lee Hooker, Ian and Sylvia, Phil Ochs (early in his career), Gordon Lightfoot, Richie Havens, The Pozo Seco Singers, The Band, the Electric Flag, Jesse Winchester, and Janis Joplin.\n\nOn August 20, 1962, Bob Dylan signed a contract which made Grossman his manager. Grossman also extended hospitality to Dylan at his home in Woodstock in upstate New York. Dylan liked the area so much he purchased a house there in 1965. The cover of Dylan's album \"Bringing It All Back Home\" was photographed at Grossman's home in Woodstock. The woman in the cover photo with Dylan, in the red trouser suit, was Grossman's wife, Sally. Having returned to Woodstock at the end of his 1966 World Tour, Dylan was on his way home from Grossman's house in West Saugerties when he suffered the motorcycle accident that precipitated his eight-year withdrawal from touring.\n\nWhen managing both Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary, Grossman brought the trio Dylan's song \"Blowin' in the Wind\" which they promptly recorded (on a single take) and successfully released.\n\nIn his autobiography, \"\", Dylan describes first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: \"He looked like Sydney Greenstreet from the film \"The Maltese Falcon\", had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and he sat at his corner table. Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl.\"\n\nWhen Bob Dylan was about to perform at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1969, English critic Michael Gray asked Grossman about the rumor that The Beatles might appear on-stage with Dylan. Grossman replied, sotto voce: \"Of course the Beatles would like to join Bob Dylan on stage. I should like to fly to the moon.\" The contracts between Dylan and Grossman were officially dissolved on July 17, 1970, prompted by Dylan's earlier realization that Grossman had taken 50% of his song publishing rights in a hastily-signed contract.\n\nWhen Grossman signed Janis Joplin and her four bandmates from Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1967, he told them he would not tolerate any intravenous drug use, and all five agreed to abide by the rule. When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500.\n\nOn October 4, 1970, two-and-a-half months after Grossman was dealt a blow by the dissolution of his contracts with Dylan, his most famous remaining client, Janis Joplin, died suddenly from a heroin overdose. Grossman refused to speak about her death to journalists or colleagues in the music business, leaving his employee Myra Friedman to handle the phone calls that flooded their office. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, Grossman's \"feelings about the loss of his most valuable client are not known.\" What is known is that in 1974, by which time his only living clients were the members of The Band, he kept busy with Joplin's legacy. The San Francisco Associated Indemnity Corporation challenged him on his collection of $200,000 from his life insurance policy, which led to a bizarre civil trial in the spring of that year, covered by the \"New York Post\", in which the insurer tried to prove that the singer's death was a suicide, not an accidental overdose as had been determined by Dr. Thomas Noguchi. Grossman testified that he had never known the extent of Joplin's substance abuse when she was alive, and that he secured the accidental death policy \"with air crashes in mind.\" He won the case and collected $112,000. In 1974 he also assisted Howard Alk with the creation of the feature-length documentary \"Janis\", locating and using black and white film footage in which the singer says she is satisfied with Grossman as her manager.\n\nIn 1969, Grossman established the Bearsville Recording Studio near Woodstock, and in 1970 he founded Bearsville Records, which evolved from his brief partnership with the Ampex company to establish a record label of the same name. Although that venture was short-lived - Todd Rundgren's debut solo album \"Runt\" was one of its few successful releases - this soon led to the establishment of Grossman's own Bearsville Records label, which was originally distributed through Ampex, and then by Warner Bros. Records.\n\nIn addition to Rundgren's solo recordings and those of his band Utopia, the label also recorded acts including Jesse Winchester, Foghat, Gil Evans, Paul Butterfield, Sparks, Felix Cavaliere, Randy Vanwarmer, Lazarus, Jesse Frederick, Roger Powell, NRBQ and The dB's. When Michael Friedman joined the Grossman office he brought Todd Rundgren with him and signed Rundgren to a management contract with Grossman. This was soon after leaving his original group Nazz and during the early 1970s he worked extensively on record production projects, either for the Bearsville label or for Grossman's other clients. It was Grossman who recommended Rundgren to Robbie Robertson of The Band as the engineer on an album by Jesse Winchester, which in turn led to Rundgren working on The Band's third LP \"Stage Fright\". Rundgren also worked briefly on the early \"Pearl\" sessions with Janis Joplin, but these came to nothing and the project was subsequently taken over by Paul A. Rothchild. Joplin's Rundgren-produced recording of the song \"One Night Stand\" from March 28, 1970 stayed in a vault for more than a decade then became part of her posthumous \"Farewell Song\" album.\n\nThe Bearsville label continued into the early 1980s, folding in 1984, two years before Grossman's death. Bearsville Studios became Todd Rundgren's recording base through the late 1970s and 1980s and was used by a slew of top-line American and international acts.\n\nGrossman died of a heart attack on January 25, 1986, while flying on the Concorde, aged 59. He was en route to London and was planning to make a trip to Cannes, France to attend a music convention. He is buried behind his own Bearsville Theater near Woodstock, New York.\n\nGrossman had a reputation for aggressiveness in both his method of acquiring clients and the implementation of their successes. That aggression was based in large measure on Grossman's faith in his own aesthetic judgments. Grossman charged his clients 25 percent commission (industry standards were 15 percent). He is quoted as saying, \"Every time you talk to me you're ten percent smarter than before. So I just add ten percent on to what all the dummies charge for nothing.\"\n\nIn negotiations, one of Grossman's favorite techniques was silence. Musician manager Charlie Rothschild said of Grossman, \"He would simply stare at you and say nothing. He wouldn't volunteer any information, and that would drive people crazy. They would keep talking to fill the void, and say anything. He had a remarkable gift for tipping the balance of power in his favor.\"\n\nGrossman sometimes appeared treacherously devoted to his clients' satisfaction. While wooing Joan Baez into representation, Grossman is quoted as saying, \"Look, what do you like? Just tell me what do you like? I can get it for you. I can get anything you want. Who do you want? Just tell me. I'll get you anybody you want.\"\n\nIn the documentary film chronicling Dylan's 1965 tour of the United Kingdom, \"Dont Look Back\", Grossman can be seen constantly protecting his client, sometimes aggressively confronting people he thinks are disrespectful to Dylan. In one memorable scene, he works with musical entrepreneur Tito Burns to extract a good price for Dylan's appearance on BBC One television. The director of \"Dont Look Back\", D. A. Pennebaker, said of Grossman's management tactics, \"I think Albert was one of the few people that saw Dylan's worth very early on, and played it absolutely without equivocation or any kind of compromise.\"\n\nThere are two interesting comments on Grossman in Martin Scorsese's film \"No Direction Home\". One is Dylan's: \"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure... all immaculately dressed, every time you see him. You could smell him coming.\" The other is John Cohen's: \"I don't think Albert manipulated Bob, because Bob was weirder than Albert.\"\n\nIn the 2007 Bob Dylan biopic \"I'm Not There\", Grossman was represented as the fictitious character Norman, played by Mark Camacho. In the film, Norman makes many of the remarks spoken by Grossman in \"Dont Look Back\", at one point saying to an English hotel manager, \"And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes and most stupid persons I've ever spoken to in my life\". He was also briefly portrayed as the manager of the fictional Bob Dylan (Hayden Christensen as Billy Quinn) in the 2006 film \"Factory Girl\".\n\nIn the 2013 Film \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" by the Coen brothers, F. Murray Abraham portrays a fictional character named Bud Grossman, who owns The Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago, the same name as Albert Grossman's Chicago club. In the film, fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) auditions for Bud Grossman, who replies: \"I don't see a lot of money here.\" This comment refers to the experience of Dave Van Ronk, who recounted a similar audition for Grossman, who then asked: \"Do you know who works here? Big Bill Broonzy works here. Josh White works here... Now tell me why I should hire you?\" After this comment, Grossman offers Davis a part in a band he is about to put together, consisting of two guys and a girl, which one journalist notes is \"a reference to Peter, Paul, and Mary, the trio that Albert Grossman put together in 1961—ultimately choosing Noel Paul Stookey as the third member of the group, rather than Van Ronk, whom he also considered.\" Davis turns down the offer.\n"}

The river originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern Georgia. The river flows for into the artificial Hiwassee Reservoir in North Carolina. The Nottely River is dammed in Georgia, creating Lake Nottely. Arkaqua Creek is a tributary.\n\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: \n\nThe region was occupied by Native Americans, associated with modern-day Muskogean tribes, until the early 18th century. The earliest European maps only vaguely show the area to be occupied by a mountain branch of the Apalachee people. However, it is quite likely that groups ancestral to the Creek and/or Yuchi Indians occupied the Nottely River Basin at some time in the past. After the Cherokees occupied the region, most of their villages had names from the Muskogee (Creek) language. However, the region seems to have remained thinly populated due to its proximity to Creek Indian territory.\n\nThe origin of the word, Nottely, is not known for certain, but appears to be derived from the Hitchiti-Creek word \"Note-le\", which means, \"People on the Other Side.\"\n\nIn 1715 the Cherokees invited leaders of all the major Creek provinces to a diplomatic conference in the nearby town of Tugaloo, at the head of the Savannah River. All of the Creek leaders were murdered in their sleep. This act of treachery precipitated a 40-year-long war between the Creeks and the Cherokees. Initially, all the branches of the Creeks were involved, but only the Kowita branch fought the war continuously. By the 1750s, the Kowita Creeks alone had gained so much military prowess that they were consistently defeating the Cherokees in battle. One Creek war leader bragged that he had sent women and boys into battle, but still captured another Cherokee town. By 1755 the Kowita Creeks had destroyed all of the Cherokee towns and villages in the Nottely and Hiwassee Valleys. The 1755 John Mitchell Map labels the entire region \"Deserted Cherokee settlement.\"\n\nIn 1763 the Cherokees lost all of their territory in North Carolina, east of the 80th longitude line, which runs through Murphy, NC. This was punishment for the Cherokees switching sides in the French and Indian War. The Creeks agreed to give back their recently regained lands in North Carolina and Georgia, in return for most of the land in Alabama, which had been taken from the French by the British. Some small Cherokee settlements such as Choestoe (Rabbit) and Chota (Frog in Creek) returned to the Nottely River Basin. In 1838, the Cherokees were removed from Georgia and were forcibly deported to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma.)\n\nA historical marker near the Nottely River describes a massive battle in 1755 on Blood Mountain between the Cherokees and the Creeks, in which the Cherokees won all of northern Georgia.\n\nAfter the Cherokee Trail of Tears, the Nottely Basin slowly filled with settlers, many of whom were from Scotland or Ulster. The region was isolated from the remainder of the State of Georgia until the 1920s, when the first paved highways were constructed. Improved highway access during the early 21st century resulted in a population boom. Many of the new residents migrated from Florida in the aftermath of a series of severe hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. The Nottely River Basin is still farmed intensively. It is known for both sorghum syrup and several varieties of vegetables.\n"}

The age has continually been under debate with adjustments being made in line with rulings, the results of psychological research and to some extent public pressure. The age was seven at common law, and raised by the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to eight (section 50) and by the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 to ten, at which it remains.\n\nIn Australian law, it is a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 can be held responsible for criminal action. This presumption exists to protect children by acknowledging that they do not have sufficient development to understand the gravity and consequences of committing a criminal act.\nRecent amendments to Impaired Driving law allows the Crown to rely on a conclusive presumption. Normally, where the police conduct a Breathalyzer test within 2 hours of the operation of a conveyance (or care and control), the court can accept the Blood Alcohol Concentration as being the same at the time of the operation of the vehicle as at the time of the offence. If the test is conducted outside the two hours, and the Blood Alcohol concentration is greater than 20 mg of alcohol/100 mL of blood, there is now a Conclusive Presumption that the Blood Alcohol Concentration can be increased by 5 mg of alcohol/100 mL of blood for each 30 minutes.

{"id": "1899754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899754", "title": "2006 South Australian state election", "text": "2006 South Australian state election\n\nThe state election for the 51st Parliament of South Australia was held in the Australian state of South Australia on 18 March 2006, and was conducted by the independent State Electoral Office.\n\nIn the 47-seat South Australian House of Assembly, the Labor government was returned in a landslide with 28 seats from a 56.8 percent two-party-preferred vote, winning six seats which were previously Liberal, who were reduced to just 15 seats, the worst result in their history.\n\nIn the 22-seat South Australian Legislative Council, the balance of power has been continuously held by the crossbench since the 1985 election. With half of the seats up for election, Labor gained an additional seat at the expense of the Liberals, Nick Xenophon and No Pokies rose to prominence after unexpectedly winning a historic fifth of the entire statewide vote, the Greens won their first seat, Family First won their second seat to hold two seats, while the faltering Democrats failed to win a seat for the first time in their history.\n\n\nThe centre-left Australian Labor Party, elected in 2002 and led by Premier Mike Rann of the Rann Government, gained six Liberal-held seats and a 7.7 percent statewide two-party preferred swing, resulting in a net gain of five seats and the first Labor majority government since the 1985 election with 28 of the 47 House of Assembly (lower house) seats.\n\nThe centre-right South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia, led by Leader of the Opposition Rob Kerin, regained a former independent seat while losing other seats – a net loss of five seats. The Liberals were left with only 15 of 47 seats, the worst result for the Liberals in South Australian electoral history.\n\nIndependent members Bob Such and Rory McEwen were re-elected. Kris Hanna, elected in 2002 representing Labor, was re-elected as an independent member. The sitting Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald was also re-elected.\n\nWith 11 of the 22-member Legislative Council (upper house) standing for election, both major parties finished with a total of eight of the 22 seats, with Labor winning four of the 11 and the Liberals winning three. No Pokies independent Nick Xenophon polled 20.5 percent, an unprecedented result for an independent or minor party, which resulted in both Xenophon and his running mate, Ann Bressington, being elected. Xenophon's third running mate, John Darley, was later appointed to the vacancy created by Xenophon's resignation. Family First had a second member elected. The Democrats vote collapsed with no candidate elected, leaving them with one remaining member in the upper house. The SA Greens won a seat for the first time.\n\nFollowing the outcome of the election, the member for Davenport, Iain Evans, replaced Rob Kerin as leader of the Liberal Party and thus as Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Australian Labor Party is Australia's oldest political party, founded in 1891. It is a centre-left social democratic party which is formally linked to the trade union labour movement. At a state level, the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party had been in government since the previous election in 2002, having been in opposition from 1993 to 2002. Since the 1970 election ending decades of electoral malapportionment of the Playmander, nine of the 12 elections since have been won by Labor. Labor's most notable premiers in South Australia include Thomas Price in the 1900s, reformist Don Dunstan in the 1970s, John Bannon in the 1980s and the factionally nonaligned and pragmatic Mike Rann. The party's deputy leader, and therefore the Deputy Premier, was Kevin Foley.\n\nThe South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia is a centre-right conservative liberal party with close links to business and advocating free markets. Whilst primarily a socially conservative party, there exists a more socially liberal wing, colloquially known as 'wet', 'moderate' or small-l liberals, highlighted by the short-lived Liberal Movement who first contested the 1975 election as a separate party led by Steele Hall. At state level, in 1973 the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia emerged from the Liberal and Country League (LCL), which in turn had resulted from a merger between the Liberal Federation and the Country Party in 1932. The state opposition leader at the 2006 election, Rob Kerin, was seen as being largely aloof from factional disputes.\n\nThe Nationals SA is a sub-division of the conservative National Party of Australia (formerly the Country Party). First contesting the 1965 election, they have only held two seats: Flinders (1973–1993) and Chaffey (1997–2010). Former member Karlene Maywald, representing the Riverland district of Chaffey, accepted a cabinet position in 2004 as part of the Rann Labor government, as Minister for the River Murray, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Small Business, and later Minister for Water Security. This informal ALP-NAT coalition (the first since 1935) caused an uproar, with the federal Liberal member for the SA seat of Sturt, Christopher Pyne, calling for Maywald's expulsion from the Nationals, and Patrick Secker calling for a corruption enquiry into the appointment. Neither eventuated. As the Liberal Party in South Australia is descended from a historical merger from an earlier Country Party, the SA Nationals are not as dominant in rural areas as their eastern state counterparts.\n\nThe SA Greens, founded in 1995, are a sub-division of the left-wing Australian Greens. They are based on green politics and consider themselves a new politics party with strong beliefs in ecology, democracy and social justice amongst other issues. Federally and locally they have seen a continued rise in primary votes, in part due to the demise of the Australian Democrats. The 2007 federal election saw 77.28% of the Greens' preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's Parliamentary leader is Mark Parnell.\n\nThe Family First Party, founded immediately before the 2002 state election, has a political ideology based on Christian-influenced conservatism. Although officially a secular party, it has close links to the Pentecostal movement, and in particular the Assemblies of God denomination. Its social policies generally mirror conservative Christian values (but not necessarily politically conservative values). The 2007 federal election saw 57.10% of their preferences flow to the Liberals over the Labor Party in SA. The party's leader at the time of the election was Andrew Evans.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were originally a centrist party, with most current policies based on social liberalism. Federally, the party was founded in 1977 from three different groups, all of which had split from the Liberal Party at different times: 1) the Liberal Movement, which had split from its parent over electoral reform; 2) the Australia Party, which had rebelled against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and 3) initial leader Don Chipp, who left the Liberal Party, citing dissatisfaction with the increasing underrepresentation of small-l liberals within the party.\n\nAt the state level it is descended from the New Liberal Movement (New LM) of Robin Millhouse, who held the Democrats' only lower house seats, Mitcham and its successor seat Waite. The Democrats have suffered internal problems and leadership scuffles since 1997. The 2007 federal election saw 65.79% of Democrat preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader at the election was Sandra Kanck.\n\nSouth Australia is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the Parliament of South Australia, which consists of The Sovereign (represented by the Governor of South Australia), the House of Assembly (lower house) which forms the government, and the Legislative Council (upper house) as a house of review. Forty-seven members of the lower house represent single-member electorates and are elected under the full-preference Instant-runoff voting (IRV) system for fixed four-year terms. The independent State Electoral Office, which conducts elections, is responsible for a mandatory redistricting of boundaries before each election to ensure one vote one value. At each election, voters choose half of the 22 upper house members, each of whom serves eight-year terms in a single statewide electorate.\n\nThe Legislative Council is elected under the preferential Single Transferable Vote (STV) system through a means of Group voting tickets. Voters can choose to vote for a ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes \"above the line\" or can vote for individual candidates by numbering all the boxes \"below the line\" (54 in the 2006 election). In above the line voting, ticket votes are distributed according to the party or group voting ticket registered before the election with the election management body. As more than 95% of ballot papers are above the line, this form of voting often leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates.\n\nVoting is compulsory once enrolled in South Australian elections, which results in turnout rates above 90 percent. Informal voting, which occurs when a voting slip is not valid, is at a rate of under five percent. Voting slips are informal when they are not filled out correctly, such examples are not numbering subsequent numbers, not filling out all the candidate boxes with numbers (except the last candidate), or in some other way that is verified by the State Electoral Office as illegible. South Australian elections have some features that are unique to the rest of Australia.\n\nAs elections have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known well ahead of time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at the latest. On 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council – close of rolls on 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the return of writs on or before 28 April 2006.\n\nIn the 2002 election, Labor won 23 seats, the Liberals 20, Nationals 1, and conservative Independents won three. As 24 seats are required to govern, the Liberal Party was expected to retain government with the support of all four independents. However, in a surprise decision, one of the conservative independents, Peter Lewis, decided to support Labor in exchange for holding a constitutional convention, making him speaker of the House of Assembly, and concessions for his electorate including the phasing out of commercial fishing in the River Murray, prioritising the eradication of the branched broomrape weed, changing water rates for irrigation, fast-tracking a feasibility study for a weir and lock at Wellington, and improving rural roads. Lewis resigned as speaker in April 2005 after controversy over allegations of paedophilia he had made about a serving MP. However, by this time, Labor had already gained the support of independents Bob Such and Rory McEwen in 2002, as well as Nationals SA member Karlene Maywald in 2004. Such was given the position of speaker for the remainder of the government's term.\n\nThe Labor campaign was heavily based around Premier Mike Rann with Labor's advertising swapping between the mottos \"Building South Australia\" and, to a greater extent, \"RANN Gets Results\". Some commentators also argued that the \"presidential\" style of campaign, common in modern Australian politics, could be seen in Labor's formal campaign launch at the Norwood Town Hall the Sunday before the election, which had some similarities to the nomination conventions that the major parties hold in the United States.\n\nAnother facet of the Labor campaign was extensive negative campaigning against Liberal leader Rob Kerin, including an advertisement featuring an excerpt of an interview that Kerin had with FIVEaa presenter Keith Conlon, who asked Kerin why he wanted to be leader of the Liberal Party. Kerin stammered for a few seconds and gave the impression that he was uncertain. The advertisement concluded with the question, \"Does Rob Want The Job?\". Conlon complained that the advertisement gave the false impression that he was endorsing Labor, but Labor campaign director David Feeney dismissed his concerns. Other negative advertisements run by Labor revolved around the actions of the previous Liberal government—one advertisement and leaflet reminded voters that while in power, the previous Liberal government closed 65 schools, closed hospital wards, and privatised the Electricity Trust of South Australia.\n\nConsidered \"strapped for cash\", the Liberal Party ran a very limited television and radio campaign. Businessman Robert Gerard was forced to resign from his Federal Liberal Party-appointed position on the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia due to the party appointing him to the position despite the known fact that he had outstanding tax avoidance issues being dealt with by the Australian Taxation Office, and had thus subsequently pulled out of his traditional role of bankrolling the state division of the party, leaving the party with \"only enough funds for the most basic campaign\". Kerin indicated people would have to \"wait and see\" if there would be any campaign, even asking trade unions for donations, no matter how small. The advertisements that did run argued that Labor was wasting record tax receipts from the GST. A number of embarrassments for the Liberal Party surrounded their television advertisement—in an early version released to journalists, Labor was spelt \"Labour\" (Labor cabinet minister King O'Malley dropped the 'u' in 1912 to \"modernise\" it as per American English) and the advertisement alleged that South Australia's hospital waiting lists were the worst in the nation, which Labor successfully disputed to the Electoral Commissioner. During the election campaign, David Pisoni, the Liberal candidate for Unley, made allegations in his advertising that Labor and their candidate Michael Keenan supported controversial urban infill programmes, which Labor flatly denied. Electoral Commissioner Kay Mousley investigated and ordered that the advertisements be withdrawn and corrections be run at Pisoni's expense.\n\nThe Labor minority government sought to win a majority in the House of Assembly. Opinion polls indicated that this was likely and ABC elections expert Antony Green said that the \"Labor government looks set to be returned with an increased majority\". Centrebet had Labor at odds of $1.01 and the Liberals at $12.00 for a majority government.\n\nMost commentators agreed that the Liberal Party had little chance of winning government, and that Kerin would step down from the leadership after the election, a suspicion confirmed in Kerin's concession speech. Martin Hamilton-Smith was considering mounting a leadership challenge, however, he withdrew on 14 October 2005 (probably for the sake of the impression of party unity) and subsequently resigned or was pushed from the opposition frontbench.\n\nOne of the most publicised issues prior to the election was the tram extension from Victoria Square to the Adelaide railway station which the Liberals, despite having proposed the idea in their previous transport plan, now opposed. Construction began in April 2007 and was operational as of October 2007. The Adelaide Airport expansion suffered fuel delivery related delays that Labor was criticised for. A perennial election issue, lack of safety improvement of the Britannia Roundabout was focused on by the Norwood Liberal candidate. Land and payroll tax cuts worth $1.5 billion were announced by Labor, the largest in the state's history. The tax cuts coincided with South Australia achieving an economic \"Triple A\" rating under the current Labor government. Business SA chief executive Peter Vaughan \"praised\" Labor's economic management.\n\n\"The Advertiser\" revealed details of \"the biggest project of its kind in South Australia's history\", a $1.5 billion redevelopment on the western bank of the inner harbour. The development will include 2000 new homes on government-owned land and new buildings as high as 12 storeys. This followed the awarding of a $6 billion air warfare destroyer contract to ASC Pty Ltd, based in the electorate at Osborne.\n\nThe future of the River Murray has come under threat due to falling water levels, and in an unprecedented move, Nationals MP Karlene Maywald was given a cabinet position as Minister for the River Murray in 2004. Possible nuclear waste dumps were of concern to many Adelaide residents; Premier Rann successfully lobbied against any federal government proposals.\n\nLaw and order was another key issue, with Labor promising extra police. Tough drink and drug driving laws had also been introduced which included zero tolerance roadside testing for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Methamphetamine, and later MDMA. Labor introduced speed limit reduction legislation which took effect in March 2003 which saw non-arterial non-main roads and most Adelaide CBD roads reduce from 60 km/h to 50 km/h. The Liberals proposed to increase the speed limit back to 60 km/h for several roads, concentrated mainly around the Adelaide Park Lands.\n\nAllegations were made over the condition of the state's health system and the capacity to deal with mental health issues. Labor pledged to buy back Modbury Hospital located in the district of Florey, privatised under the Liberal government to alleviate the effect of the State Bank collapse.\n\nThe need for homosexual law reform was acknowledged by both major parties; however, there was disquiet within the Labor Party over delays. December 2006 saw the Domestic Partners bill pass which provides greater recognition to same sex relationships on a range of issues such as superannuation. The bill was supported by all parties after much negotiation, but in the end was voted against by both members of Family First, as well as Liberal Terry Stephens.\n\nElectoral reform policies received little attention, as did the eventually shelved referendum proposal by the Rann Government to abolish or reform the Legislative Council. WorkCover underfunded liability increases have also received little attention, despite the fact that the liability has climbed from a disputed $67 to $85 million to $700 million since Labor came into government in 2002 due to a more generous compensation scheme. Labor have since looked into reform for the scheme including cutting payments to injured workers.\n\nThere were claims that federal industrial relations reform, WorkChoices, was an influential issue in the election. The Liberals announced 4,000 public service job cuts to fund their election promises.\n\nNewspoll polling is conducted via random telephone number selection in city and country areas. Roy Morgan polling is conducted face-to-face Australia-wide. Sampling sizes consist of 500–1000 electors, Roy Morgan has a sampling tolerance (the Margin of error) of ±3.2 percent for a 40 to 60 percent rating in a sample size of 1000 electors, and ±4.5 for 500 electors. The sampling tolerance rate is lower for high and low percentages.\n\nThe final results for the House of Assembly seats were 28 Labor, 15 Liberal, three independents and one National. First preference and two party preferred statistics for each district are available through the South Australian House of Assembly electoral districts article.\n\nLabor won six of eight key seats, the Liberals one of three. Labor's wins included the previously marginal Liberal seats of Hartley, Light, Morialta, Mawson, Bright and Newland. The Liberals regained Peter Lewis' seat of Hammond.\n\nSA Nationals MP Karlene Maywald and independent MPs Bob Such, Rory McEwen and Kris Hanna were all re-elected. Hanna was elected at the 2002 election as a Labor candidate; this counted as a loss for Labor, giving Labor a net gain of five seats.\n\nLabor, the Liberals and the Greens ran in all 47 seats, the Democrats ran in all but Giles which resulted in a contested seat vote of three percent, Family First ran in all but Ramsay and Croydon with a contested seat vote of 6.1 percent. The Nationals ran in Chaffey, Flinders, Finniss, and MacKillop, averaging 24.8 percent in those seats. Dignity for Disabled, No Rodeo and One Nation ran in 10, 7 and 6 six seats respectively.\n\nJack Snelling became speaker of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe outer southern suburbs district of Mawson was first won by former Liberal Police Minister Robert Brokenshire in the 1993 state election. He was defeated by former radio presenter Leon Bignell, who gained a 5.7 percent two party preferred swing for Labor.\n\nThe other outer suburbs district that fell to Labor was Bright, which had been held since 1989 by former Liberal energy minister Wayne Matthew, who decided to retire at this election. The seat was contested for the Liberals by Legislative Council member Angus Redford, who faced a tougher fight than expected. He was defeated by Labor's Chloë Fox, who received a 14.4 percent swing on a two party preferred basis, the largest in the state.\n\nThe inner southern suburbs district of Unley was won in 2002 by outspoken Liberal Mark Brindal who failed to win preselection for the seat and moved to contest the marginal Labor seat of Adelaide, but was shrouded in a controversy concerning a sexual relationship that Brindal had with a mentally ill man, forcing him to withdraw. The Liberal candidate was businessman David Pisoni, while Labor fielded Unley Mayor Michael Keenan. Despite a 7.9 percent two party preferred swing against him, Pisoni hung onto the seat by 1.1 percent.\n\nThe inner north eastern suburbs district of Hartley had been won by Joe Scalzi in 1993 and held by a very narrow margin in each subsequent election. The district has a very high proportion of Italian migrants and the ability to speak the language is considered by many commentators as being vital for a candidate to win the seat. This was a factor in Labor's preselection of political staffer Grace Portolesi, who defeated Scalzi with a 5.9 percent two party preferred swing.\n\nThe neighbouring district of Morialta had been held by former Liberal Tourism Minister Joan Hall since 1993. She was defeated by Labor's Lindsay Simmons, who received a 12 percent two party preferred swing, reclaiming the seat for Labor for the first time since 1975.\n\nIn the outer north-east, the district of Newland had been won by Liberal Dorothy Kotz since 1989. After her decision to retire, the Liberals preselected police officer and local councillor Mark Osterstock. He was defeated by Labor's Tom Kenyon, who recorded a 12.5 percent two party preferred swing.\n\nLight, which contains Gawler and the outer northern suburbs, was recontested by sitting Liberal member and former Education Minister Malcolm Buckby. He was defeated by Labor candidate and Gawler Mayor Tony Piccolo, who received a 4.9 percent two party preferred swing. This was the first time since 1944 that Labor had won the seat.\n\nThe rural and outback district of Stuart was first won in 1997 by Liberal Graham Gunn, a 40-year member of parliament and former Speaker. As in 2002, he was challenged by Labor ministerial adviser Justin Jarvis. Unlike the Adelaide metropolitan area and the neighbouring seat of Giles, there was only a small swing of 0.7 percent to Labor, so Gunn managed to hang on with a margin of 0.6 percent.\n\nThe inner eastern suburbs district of Norwood, held for Labor by former Norwood mayor Vini Ciccarello, was expected to be a tough contest, particularly after the Liberal preselection of former Adelaide Crows footballer Nigel Smart. Ciccarello retained the seat picking up a 3.7 percent swing on the two party preferred vote.\n\nThe other Labor seat considered vulnerable was the neighbouring inner city district of Adelaide where high-profile Education Minister and former Lord Mayor Jane Lomax-Smith was challenged by Liberal Diana Carroll. Lomax-Smith comprehensively defeated Carroll with a 9.2 percent swing to Labor on the two-party preferred vote.\n\nThe southern suburbs district of Mitchell was won at the 2002 election by Labor's Kris Hanna. After the election, Hanna defected to the Greens and subsequently left and became an independent on 8 February 2006. Hanna faced a tough contest against by Labor's Rosemary Clancy. Despite pre-election expectations of a safe Labor win, Hanna defeated Clancy by 0.6 percent with the aid of Liberal preferences. Labor won a 65.2 percent two-party vote against the Liberals.\n\nThe district of Fisher, located in Adelaide's south, was held by independent MP Dr Bob Such. Late in the campaign, there was some speculation that Fisher may have been a closer contest than commentators initially expected, but Such comfortably defeated Labor's Amanda Rishworth and the Liberals' Andy Minnis with an independent candidate election best 45.2 percent of the primary vote, picking up a 4.6 percent two candidate preferred swing. The election outcome saw Such facing the Labor candidate on the two party preferred vote as opposed to the Liberal candidate in 2002. Labor won a 59.4 percent two-party vote against the Liberals.\n\nThe Riverland-based district of Chaffey was the only seat held by Nationals SA. River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald easily defeated Liberal Anna Baric. Maywald received a 3.2 percent swing on the two party preferred vote. The Liberals won a 71.8 percent two-party vote against Labor.\n\nThe district of Mount Gambier (which also includes much of South Australia's south east) was a close contest between independent and Agriculture Minister Rory McEwen and Liberal Peter Gandolfi. McEwen prevailed despite a 20.4 percent swing against him on the two party preferred vote. The Liberals won a 55.6 percent two-party vote against Labor.\n\nThe Murray Bridge based district of Hammond was won in 2002 by independent MP Peter Lewis who then cut a deal to deliver government to Labor. Facing almost certain defeat, he declined to recontest the district and his attempt to win a seat in the Legislative Council failed. Hammond was won comfortably by Liberal Adrian Pederick.\n\nWith Mitchell and Fisher included, Labor won the two-party vote in 30 of 47 seats.\n\n\nThe following pendulum is known as the Mackerras Pendulum after its inventor, the psephologist Malcolm Mackerras. The pendulum works by lining up all of the seats held in the House of Assembly according to the percentage point margin they are held by on a two party preferred basis. This is also known as the swing required for the seat to change hands. Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties, the number of seats that change hands can be predicted. The seats are classified as follows: marginal 0–5.99 percent, fairly safe 6–10 percent, safe over 10 percent.\n\nIn the South Australian Legislative Council, Labor won 4 seats, the Liberals won 3 seats, both No Pokies member Nick Xenophon and his running mate Ann Bressington were elected and Family First and the Greens won a seat each. Almost 40 percent of voters deserted the major parties for Nick Xenophon and the minor parties; this percentage had been steadily increasing over time.\n\nLabor received a 3.7 percent swing, electing four councillors as in the previous election. Carmel Zollo, Bob Sneath, Russell Wortley and Ian Hunter were all elected, with 4.39 quotas Bob Sneath was elected president of the Legislative Council.\n\nOn the other hand, the Liberal vote collapsed with a 14.1 percent swing against the Liberal Party. Having received five councillors in 2002, at this election the Liberal Party had just three councillors elected. Rob Lucas, John Dawkins and Michelle Lensink were elected on 3.12 quotas.\n\nBefore the election, No Pokies member Nick Xenophon was popular with the media and in opinion polls, but he faced a tough campaign as a result of both major parties preferencing in favour of other independents and the minor parties. No Pokies received 20.5 percent of the vote, yielding 2.46 quotas and thus seats for both Xenophon and his running mate Ann Bressington. Having been elected at the 1997 election with 2.9 percent of the vote and other independent candidates at the 2002 election on 1.3 percent of the vote (Xenophon being a sitting member at that election), the No Pokies ticket received a swing of 19.2 percent.\n\nThe Family First Party's first member, Andrew Evans MLC, was elected in 2002. Family First won 5 percent of vote with only a small swing of 0.98 percent, allowing candidate Dennis Hood to be elected on preferences.\n\nThe SA Greens won 4.3 percent of the upper house vote meaning a swing of 1.5 percent, narrowly securing Mark Parnell for the last upper house seat on preferences. This is the first time The Greens have won a seat in South Australia. Having secured second spot on the ticket at this election, Sarah Hanson-Young was successful in gaining the first spot on the ticket at the 2007 federal election, which saw the Greens secure their first federal upper house seat in South Australia.\n\nThe Australian Democrats fell to just one seat in the Legislative Council held by Sandra Kanck, after Kate Reynolds was defeated in her bid for re-election after being appointed in 2003. The Democrats gained only 1.8 percent after a 5.5 percent swing against them. Kanck has since announced that she would not recontest her seat at the next election, placing serious clouds over the future of the party in the state.\n\nPauline Hanson's One Nation Party gained 0.8 percent of the upper house vote and won none of the six lower house seats they contested. Their highest vote was 4.1 percent in the district of Hammond, followed by 2.7 percent in Goyder, and the other four hovering around 1 percent.\n\nDignity for Disabled ran for the first time and won 0.6 percent of the upper house vote; they won none of the 10 lower house seats they contested. Their best results were in Wright and Bright, with 2.4 percent in each (506 and 492 votes respectively).\n\nLabor-turned-independent Terry Cameron and Liberal-turned-independent Peter Lewis both failed in their bids for re-election.\n\nAfter the election, Rob Kerin vacated the position of opposition leader. The party selected conservative Iain Evans (son of former politician Stan Evans) for the role, with moderate Vickie Chapman (daughter of former politician Ted Chapman) as deputy leader. The only other contestant had been Isobel Redmond, who ran because she was concerned by some speculation that the Evans deal may have been stitched up by federal Liberal counterparts Christopher Pyne and Nick Minchin. Preferred premier ratings in July 2006 showed Rann on 71 percent with Evans on 15 percent. Only 27 percent of Liberal Party supporters saw Evans as the preferred premier. Continuing low support for the new Liberal leadership saw Martin Hamilton-Smith replace Evans in April 2007, however this move saw Liberal support decline further to a three-year low according to an Advertiser poll conducted a month after the leadership change. Over half of polling respondents were unable to name the leader of the Liberal Party. This contradicted Newspolls quarterly polling indicating the Rann Labor government slipping to a two-party preferred figure of 57 percent down four percent, with a preferred premier rating of 52 percent down 14 percent for Rann and a first-time rating of 21 percent for Martin Hamilton-Smith. Poll results also show Rann's satisfaction rating was below 60 percent for the first time since coming to office at 58 percent, with Hamilton-Smith receiving a 33 percent satisfaction rate.\n\nPreviously unknown quantity Ann Bressington, elected on the back of Nick Xenophon's No Pokies popularity, has proposed mainly conservative social policies such as raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 21, zero tolerance of illicit drugs, mandatory twice-annual drug tests of every school student over the age of 14 regardless of whether parents give their consent, and making the sale of \"drug-taking equipment\" illegal. However, she remains undecided on voluntary euthanasia, calling it \"a personal struggle\".\n\nSetting a precedent, Sandra Kanck's pro-euthanasia speech which contained suicide methods was censored from the internet version of Hansard in August 2006 as a result of an upper house motion, with Labor, Family First, Nick Xenophon and Ann Bressington voting for, and the Liberals and SA Greens member Mark Parnell voting against. Despite this, the speech was published on a non-Australian website.\n\nThe state's budget was released on 21 September 2006. It included 1,600 public service job axings despite an election pledge of only 400, however none of the redundancies will be forced. It also included increases in some fees and charges such as victims of crime levies and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) charges. There were increases in funding for health, schools, police and prisons, and the Department of Public Prosecutions. The 2007–2008 budget released on 13 June 2007 saw additional spending on Transport, Energy and Infrastructure, Health, Families and Communities, and Justice portfolios such as transport initiatives including revitalisation of the rail network, commencement of the $1.7 billion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital, funding for mental health reform including the delivery of health services, and funding for new commitments to law and order policies.\n\nNo Pokies MP Nick Xenophon resigned from parliament in early October 2007 in a successful attempt to win a seat in the Australian Senate at the 2007 federal election, which according to the South Australian result, he retained 72 percent of his 2006 vote, on 14.78 percent. His replacement is his third candidate on the 2006 ticket, former Valuer-General John Darley, and was appointed by a joint sitting on 21 November 2007, where second candidate and upper house MP Ann Bressington also took the opportunity to accuse Xenophon of lacking integrity and suitability for federal parliament.

Its course runs mainly through thinly settled areas and swamps.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Nun was a hub for trade between the Igbo Kingdom, which was based at Aboh, and Europe.

A single edit operation may be changing a single symbol of the string into another, deleting, or inserting a symbol. The length of the edit sequence provides a measure of the distance between the two strings.\n\nSeveral algorithms exist to provide an efficient way to determine string distance and specify the minimum number of transformation operations required. Such algorithms are particularly useful for delta creation operations where something is stored as a set of differences relative to a base version. This allows several versions of a single object to be stored much more efficiently than storing them separately. This holds true even for single versions of several objects if they do not differ greatly, or anything in between. \nNotably, such difference algorithms are used in molecular biology to provide some measure of kinship between different kinds of organisms based on the similarities of their macromolecules (such as proteins or DNA).\n\n\n"}

The precise scope of the rule was unclear. As Lord Dormand said on second reading in the House of Lords, \"it certainly applies to murder, manslaughter, infanticide and aiding and abetting suicide. It may also apply to motoring offences in which death is an element: causing death by dangerous driving; causing death by reckless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs; and aggravated vehicle taking causing death.\"\n\nThe Act has only three sections. Section 1 simply says:\n\nThe remaining two sections provide that a prosecution where a death occurs more than three years after an injury, or where the accused was previously convicted of an offence committed in circumstances connected with the death (for example, a previous conviction for grievous bodily harm), can be instituted only with the consent of the Attorney General.\n\nThe Act started as a private member's bill introduced by Doug Hoyle MP, who came 16th in the ballot in the 1995/6 Parliamentary session.

Her engines produced an average cruising speed of , while on two boilers she could operate at an average speed of .\n\nThe main armament on the vessel were two mounted smoothbore muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns. Her secondary armament consisted of four 18-pounder long guns.\n\n\"Keangsoo\" was a wooden dispatch vessel, laid down at Whites' shipyard at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1862 and launched on March 5, 1863. Whites had become well known for winning contracts with the Ottoman Navy during the 1850s. She was the flagship of the Lay-Osborn Flotilla, the name given to a grouping of vessels which had been arranged to be sent to China by Horatio Nelson Lay, then the Inspector General of Customs for Imperial China, to help suppress the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty gave permission for Lay to proceed with this task, and provided the funds to procure the ships. While some, such as HMS \"Africa\" (subsequently renamed \"China\") were purchased from the Royal Navy, \"Keangsoo\" was one of three dispatch vessels alongside \"Tientsin\" and \"Kwangtung\" which were procured as new builds. Permission was given by the British Government to enlist British sailors for the Chinese flotilla, and Captain Sherard Osborn was co-opted to command the fleet, with the ship under the direct command of Charles Stuart Forbes.\n\n\"Keangsoo\" underwent trials in May 1863 while underway to China. There was a problem in the command structure for the fleet, since the Chinese Government expected to receive the vessels directly under their own command, and had already assigned new commanding officers and names for the ships. However, Lay and Osborn agreed that Osborn would only accept orders from Lay, and he in turn would only pass orders on from the Chinese Government if he agreed with them on an individual basis. The ships reached Shanghai in September, where it was renamed Chen Wu () by the Chinese government. The Chinese refused to provide stores or funds since Osborn would not accept a new Chinese commander. When the authorities attempted to bribe the enlisted men from the fleet to join them, Osborn sent it to Chefoo (now Yantai). Following the intervention of a British minister, the fleet was ordered to depart for India with Osborn taking \"Keangsoo\", \"Kwangtung\", \"Amoy\" and the yacht \"Thule\" to Bombay (now Mumbai). The \"Keangsoo\" was then laid up alongside the other remaining vessels of the flotilla, since their sales were embargoed until the end of the American Civil War. She was then acquired by her Captain Forbes once again, following the end of the conflict in 1865.\n\nWhile at Nagasaki, \"Keangsoo\" was purchased by Matsukata Masayoshi, a leading Satsuma \"samurai\", on November 3, 1867, for the amount of 160,000 \"ryō\" (approx $250,000 at then current exchange rates), whence she was renamed \"Kasuga Maru\". With a speed of , and six cannons, she was faster than anything in the Tokugawa shogunate Navy, and Matsukata intended to convert her into a warship. However, already alarmed by the high cost, as the price was four times the budget Matsukata had been authorized, he was overruled by the Shimazu clan elders. She was assigned to be used as a cargo ship. In disgust, Matsukata gave up command of the ship he had bought, only to see it converted into a warship just a few months later under the command of his assistant, Akatsuka Genroku.\n\n\"Kasuga Maru\" entered Hyōgo harbour in January 1868, where she was blockaded by three ships of the Tokugawa Navy: , and . Tōgō Heihachirō, future Admiral of the Fleet, joined the ship on January 3 as a third-class officer and a gunner. The night of January 3, \"Kasuga Maru\" escaped from Hyōgo harbour with two other ships. She was spotted by \"Kaiyō Maru\", which chased her into Awa Strait. The two ships exchanged fire at a distance of 1,200-2,500 meters, without any actual hits. The exchange was named the Naval Battle of Awa and was the first naval battle in Japan between two modern fleets. \"Kasuga Maru\" returned to Kagoshima after that exchange.\n\nIn March 1869, \"Kasuga Maru\" participated in the expedition against the last remnants of the pro-Tokugawa forces in Hokkaido, where they had formed the Republic of Ezo with the support of a few French military advisors such as Jules Brunet. While at Miyako Bay, the expedition suffered a surprise attack by the Bakufu ship . \"Kaiten\" attacked the state-of-the art ironclad ship , but she was repulsed by Gatling guns on board the \"Kōtetsu\" and cannon response by \"Kasuga Maru\". The encounter has been named the Naval Battle of Miyako Bay. After these events \"Kasuga Maru\" participated in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, until the surrender of the last forces of the Republic of Ezo.\nIn April 1870, \"Kasuga Maru\" was transferred from the Satsuma Domain to the Meiji government and assigned to the newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy, and was renamed \"Kasuga\" at that time. In 1872, under the command of Itō Toshiyoshi, she carried Japanese envoys to Korea as part of Japan's ongoing attempts to obtain diplomatic recognition from Joseon dynasty Korea. The failure of this mission was one of the underlying factors in the subsequent Ganghwa Island incident of 1875, during which \"Kasuga\" was assigned to blockade the port of Busan. Under the command of Inoue Yoshika, \"Kasuga\" was also one of the ships which participated in the Taiwan Expedition of 1874.\n\n\"Kasuga\" was demobilized in 1894 and then assigned to the mine-laying group at the Takeshiki Guard District on Tsushima Island.

It was a four-page weekly newspaper, published on Saturdays. The weekly newspaper became a bi-weekly in 1901, a tri-weekly on 2 July 1918 and a daily on 2 July 1928. After Varghese Mappillai death in 1904, his nephew K. C. Mammen Mappillai took over as editor.\n\nIn 1938, Travancore state proscribed \"Malayala Manorama\" on charges of publishing news against the Diwan; Mammen Mappillai was convicted and imprisoned. \"Malayala Manorama\" re-commenced regular publication in 1947 after the Indian independence and the Diwan's downfall.\n\nOn Mammen Mappillai's death, his eldest son K. M. Cheriyan took over as the Editor-in-Chief in 1954. At this time, \"Malayala Manorama\" was produced in a single edition in Kottayam with a circulation of 28,666 copies.\n\nBy the late 1950s, \"Manorama\" steadily increased circulation and overtook \"Mathrubhumi\" in circulation, the dominant Malayalam daily at the time.\n\nThe struggle between \"Malayala Manorama\" (based in Kottayam) and \"Mathrubhumi\" (based in Kozhikode) demonstrated the forces that would drive the expansion of Indian regional newspapers. The contest also illustrated the difficulties if expansion had to rely on Gutenberg-style printing as with the case of \"Manorama\".\n\nComparison of circulation \"Malayala Manorama\" and \"Mathrubhumi\"\n\nIn 1962, \"Mathrubhumi\" launched its second edition in Kochi. The new edition sent \"Mathrubumi\" to a circulation of 170,000 copies by 1964, 19,000 more than its rival, \"Malayala Manorama\". With \"Mathrubhoomi\"'s circulation rising, it became a compulsion for \"Manorama\" to expand its reach, and consequently, introduce new technology. The competition set off a keen struggle for more readers, faster equipment and national advertising from major consumer goods companies [such as Hindustan Lever]. \"Manorama \"launched its printing centre at Kozhikode, Malabar in 1966 with a cast-off press from the paper's base at Kottayam and hand-composed type. But in the run-up to that event, it had installed an offset press at Kottayam and established a teleprinter line with New Delhi in 1965.\n\nBy 1970, it was the leading daily in Kerala. The circulation of the newspaper rose from around 30,000 to 300,000 by this expansion across the Malabar.\n\nK. M. Mathew, who took charge as editor in 1973, began a series of renovations, just as the \"Anandabazar Patrika\" did in Bengal. He brought in a series of consultants in the management [1979], technical and editorial areas, and accepted their guidance. He conducted frequent training sessions for \"Manorama\" journalists and other employees. The company restructured their organisation in 1980. K. M. Mathew said that the decision stemmed from the realisation that the daily had either to become \"fully professional\" or \"risk decline\". Mathew sent his best journalists and managers to training schools around theworld, and imported the most effective techniques in international journalism and newspaper production, which brought in a contemporary look and feel to \"Malayala Manorama\". In 1979, a new printing centre was launched at Cochin and in 1987, the Trivandrum edition was also launched. By 1998, the circulation of \"Malayala Manorama\" was increased to 1 million. In mid-2000s, the daily started units in the Middle East, focusing on the large Malayali population in the region. Mathew is credited with the introduction of the concept of \"editionalising\" with larger share for local news and reader-friendly packaging through professional page designing in \"Manorama\", which in turn impacted the entire newspaper industry in Kerala. By 2007, \"Manorama \" become the only non-English and non-Hindi daily newspaper in India to cross 1.5 million copies in circulation.\n\nK. M. Mathew was succeeded by his son Mammen Mathew in 2010. In their obituary \"The Hindu\" praised Mathew as,\"In what could only be described as a rarity then in Indian language journalism, Mathew showed an unusual commitment to modernisation and professionalism and became a role model for the newspaper industry, which in the early 1980s was at the critical juncture of embarking on a phase of unbelievable expansion.\"According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations's (ABC) January–June 2013 figures, \"Malayala Manorama\" holds a circulation of 2.1 million readers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1944 and serves under the authority of the French Football Federation. The current president of the league is Nathalie Boy de la Tour. It is heartquartered in Paris.\n\nThe league is responsible for overseeing, organizing, and managing the top two leagues in France, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, and is also responsible for the 44 professional football clubs that contest football in France (20 in Ligue 1, 20 in Ligue 2, and four in the Championnat National). The league also organizes a yearly cup competition, the Coupe de la Ligue, that, unlike the Coupe de France, is limited to professional clubs.\n\nThe history of the Ligue de Football Professionnel dates back before World War II when the committee's primary motive was to ensure clubs in France pay players their wages. The chairman of the early predecessor of the league was Emmanuel Gambardella. Another committee, which monitored professional clubs and the status of professional players also existed during this time and was headed by Gabriel Hanot, who was later responsible for the creation of the European Cup, now the UEFA Champions League. During the Vichy regime, professionalism in France was abolished, which led to clubs forming unpopular regional amateur leagues. Under the current LFP hierarchy, the years 1939–1945 are non-existent.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, many clubs were hesitant to follow the initiatives of the French Football Federation due to their belief that the federation were not thinking in their best interests and, instead, opted to join an initiative by Gambardella referred the \"Groupement des clubs autorisés\". On 27 October 1944, the Ligue Nationale de Football (National Football League) was officially founded with Gambardella being installed as the organization's first president. The league changed its name back to \"Groupement des clubs autorisés\" shortly after and kept the name until 1970 before returning to Ligue Nationale de Football. In 2000, the league changed its name to the Ligue de Football Professionnel.\n\nThe Ligue de Football Professionnel describes itself through its mission statement. The LFP must:\n\n\nThe 44 member clubs of the LFP are grouped into two divisions: Ligue 1 (20 clubs) and Ligue 2 (20 clubs). The LFP also oversee the professional clubs that suffer relegation to third-tier Championnat National. Currently, there are four clubs playing in the third division that the league manages. In any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when Lille hosted Lyon at the Stade de France in 2007 and 2008. This makes for a total of 38 games played each season in both leagues.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of each season, the club with the most points in Ligue 1 is crowned champion of France. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The three lowest placed teams are relegated to Ligue 2 and the top three teams from Ligue 2 are promoted in their place.\n\nThe LFP also organizes a cup competition, the Coupe de la Ligue. Before its foundation as an official league cup in 1994, the competition was a summer friendly tournament. Unlike the Coupe de France which allows all clubs, regardless of status, to enter, the Coupe de la Ligue only allows professional clubs to participate. The competition is considered second-rate compared to the Coupe de France and attracts much criticism from many who deem the cup as having less prestige and creating fixture congestion.\n\nThe DNCG is the organisation responsible for monitoring the accounts of professional association football clubs in France. It was founded in 1984 and is an administrative directorate of the LFP. The current president of the DNCG is Richard Olivier. Along with the LFP, the DNCG has a public mission of service. The mission of the DNCG is to oversee all financial operations of the 40 member clubs of the LFP (as well as those clubs recently relegated to the Championnat National), develop the resources of professional clubs, apply sanctions to those clubs breaking the rules of operation and to defend the morals and interests of French football in general.\n\nSince the LFP's foundation, there have been a total of nine presidents who have served. The first president of the league was Emmanuel Gambardella who ran the organization from 1944–1953. His positive influence on French football led to the French Football Federation naming the country's prestigious under-19 youth cup tournament after him. The current president is Nathalie Boy de la Tour who was elected in 2016, becoming the first woman to take the role.\n\n"}

It is based on the game of five-card cribbage, also known as the \"old game\", and is one of many solitaire card games based on those played by at least two players, best known of which is poker solitaire.\n\nFirst, twelve cards are dealt into two hands as if there are two players. The player looks at the first hand and discards two cards to contribute to an area known as the \"crib\". The player then looks at the second hand and contributes two more cards from that hand to the crib. A thirteenth card, the \"starter\", is then dealt. The starter combines with the crib and the two hands to each form a five-card cribbage hand, much the same way as the community cards in Texas hold 'em poker.\n\nPoints are scored according to how the hand/crib is combined with the starter. Hands are scored like in actual cribbage and the combinations below may occur more than once in just one hand:\n\n\nPoints are added from the two hands and from the crib and given a running total. This makes a set or deal. The cards used are then discarded and a new set of 13 cards are dealt. Since each deal uses a fourth of the entire deck, a game of cribbage solitaire is composed of four such deals. The points from the four deals are added up into a final total for the entire game. The winning final score can range from 101 to 121 (the points needed to win a game of regular cribbage) according to the player's preference.\n\nThe rules stated above are those written by Peter Arnold in his book \"Card Games for One\" (). In SolSuite's version of the game, only nine cards are dealt instead of thirteen: the six cards in the hand, the first two cards of the crib, and the starter. The player contributes two cards from his hand to the crib. Points are then scored the same way as mentioned above (except for \"his heels\"). The starter is then placed at the bottom of the deck, so that a total of six hands with cribs and starters are played, followed by one hand without a crib or a starter.

Its tasks were to gather intelligence and sabotage the enemies of the Polish people. It was used by Piłsudski to create a body independent from his cautious Austro-Hungarian supporters, and it was an important, if somewhat lesser known, counterpart to the Polish Legions. Its targets included the Russian Empire in the early phase of the war, and the German Empire later. Its membership rose from a few hundred members in 1914 to over 30,000 in 1918.\n\nThe Polish Military Organization (PMO) can be traced to formations of August 1914 or even earlier, but it was officially founded in November 1914, as a merger of two previously-existing youth para-military organisations: the Drużyny Strzeleckie and the Związek Strzelecki. Active in the Russian-held Kingdom of Poland, the PMO served as the intelligence and sabotage arm of Piłsudski's Polish Legions. In fact, many members of the illegal and secret PMO were at the same time soldiers of the Austrian-backed Polish Legions. The PMO was commanded militarily by Piłsudski himself, while the political command was a secret \"\"A\" Convent\" headed by Jędrzej Moraczewski.\n\nInitially active only in Central Poland, with time the PMO units were formed in all parts of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including modern day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. It was mainly preoccupied with intelligence and sabotage, as well as military training of its members and acquisition of arms from various armies fighting on Polish soil. The PMO members were seen as the core of the future Polish Army after Poland regained her independence.\n\nAfter most of Poland was occupied by the Central Powers in 1915, the PMO became semi-legal and unofficially supported by the German army, which saw it as a useful source of information on Russia and a useful reservoir of skilled officers. However, in July 1917, after the Oath Crisis in the Polish Legions and the arrest of Piłsudski, the PMO returned to the underground and started covert operations against German and Austrian garrisons and supply lines. In place of Piłsudski, who was sent to a German prison in the fortress in Magdeburg, the commander of the PMO became his friend, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, also future Marshal of Poland.\n\nWith the collapse of the Central Powers during the final stages of the Great War, the PMO command decided to take an active part in the war and the organisation went out in the open. In October and November 1918 the revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary made the Ober Ost army collapse. The German units were struck by mass desertions of soldiers who simply left their posts and headed for their homes. The main tasks of the PMO during this period was to disarm the withdrawing soldiers and escort them to Germany. The campaign was successful and gave the new-born Polish state a large quantity of arms and military equipment. By mid-November, most of garrisons in Galicia surrendered to PMO members and the region became controlled by Poland. The PMO members continued the disarming actions in the former Congress Kingdom as well. Finally, the PMO was the core of Polish defences of the city of Lwów in the Battle of Lwów against the attacking forces of the West Ukrainian People's Republic (roughly 400 members in the initial phase of the struggle). In December 1918, the members of the PMO were all conscripted into the newly-reborn Polish Army.\n\nContrary to the rest of units, the PMO in the Ukraine (most notably the areas controlled by both the Western Ukrainian government and the areas controlled by the Kiev-based Directorate and Hetmanate) remained active after the Polish withdrawal from Kiev in July 1920.\n\nIn February 1918, a similar organisation was formed in the German-held Greater Poland. It was modelled after the original PMO and maintained contacts with her predecessor. It assumed the name of \"Polish Military Organisation of the Prussian Partition\" and its main aim was to liberate the region and attach it to Poland. The members of the PMO became the core of the Greater Polish Army during the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918-1919. After the uprising succeeded, the PMO members were also drafted into the Polish Army, together with other military units fighting in the Uprising.\n\nIn February 1919 the Polish Military Organization of Upper Silesia was also formed. It had similar tasks to its Greater Polish counterpart and became the core of the Silesian Uprisings of 1919-1921. Afterwards the members of the PMO members were either demobilised or integrated into the Polish Army or the Polish Intelligence Services.\n\nIn Lithuania, the PMO was organizing a secret plot to overthrow the legal government of Lithuania and replace it with one more friendly towards Poland. The coup was planned for August 1919, but it was uncovered by the Lithuanian State Security Department, and mass arrests followed, thus eliminating the possibility of a coup d'état. From the documents stolen in POW headquoters safe in Vilnius and given to Prime Minister of Lithuania Augustinas Voldemaras it is clear, that this plot was directed by Józef Piłsudski himself. A PMO-led uprising did occur in the Sejny region, at the time controlled by Lithuanian forces, and led to Polish forces gaining control of that disputed territory.\n\nAlthough the PMO was disbanded in 1921, Soviet authorities claimed that it continued to exist; during the Great Purge of 1936-38, and as early as 1933, many people of Polish nationality were charged with membership in it, which was illegal, see Polish Operation of the NKVD for the circumstances, and NKVD Order No. 00485 in particular.\n\n"}

It is used both as a tool and a weapon. Tamils reserve the weapon as a symbol of karupannar. In popular culture, it is sometimes associated with gangsters. In movies, it is used as a weapon of choice. In Kerala, its primary use is for agriculture, mainly in coconut cutting, clearing pathways, cutting wood and other uses.\n\nAn aruval usually measures 3–6 feet in length (hand sickle measures 1.5 feet). The blade of this weapon originates at the grip and extends to the main part of the lade. It can be described as a sickle with an extension. It can also be thought of as a sword with a reverse curve. The shorter versions were handy for breaking apart coconuts, and the longer versions were more like battle weapons. The shorter version is usually seen in small villages. Blades are mostly straight with a curve towards the end, allowing it to function as a grabbing tool. The straight portion of the blade is also used for cutting, like a standard knife.\n\nWhile farmers typically employ the standard billhook machete \"kathir aruvāl\" \"koyttharivaal\" for harvesting crops, a longer variation called the \"veecharuvāl\" is used for clearing through wooded areas. In Kerala, Malayalam language references the semi-circular knife for paddy, called \"koduval\" and the regular sized billhook machete is known as \"vaakathi\" (coconut cutting); while the veecharuval is known simply as aruval. The veecharuval was also used as a weapon and is still used as such for self-defence in rural areas or gang warfare in cities. When not in use, the weaponised aruval was worn on the back, with the blade pointing downwards and the handle just behind the user's head. Some aruvals, such as those used in worship of the Khaval Dheivam, are as long as 3.5 feet.\n\n"}

In Brazil, both the cape and the mouth of the Oyapock are often mistaken for the whole country's northernmost point (rather than just of its coastline), and in the past this information could even be found in geography schoolbooks. Yet the true northernmost point in Brazil is actually far inland, on Monte Caburaí, in the state of Roraima, hundreds of kilometers from the Oyapock and almost a full degree more to the north.\n\nVicente Yáñez Pinzón was said to be the first European person to see the Oiapoque River in the first years of the 16th century. It has been rendered Japoc, Yapoc, Iapoco, Wiapoco, and even called the Vicente Pinzón River. Early European colonists referred to the river as the \"Wiapoco\", and it was the site of early settlements by Briton Robert Harcourt in 1608 and Dutchman Jan van Ryen in 1627. The name Oiapoque has been officially used from 1900, when a territorial dispute between Brazil and France was resolved through Swiss diplomatic arbitration.\n\nIn addition to the small towns of Oiapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock (French Guiana), there are some small villages scattered along the bank of the Oyapock, such as Camopi and Clevelândia do Norte.\n\nThe Oyapock River Bridge has been built across the river to connect the Brazilian town of Oiapoque and the French town of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock. It is the first international land border connection of French Guiana, but although completed since 2011, as of February 2017 it remains closed to traffic, due to delays in making the final payments to the construction company, building and staffing the Brazilian customs facilities, and some minor disagreements between the Brazilian and French governments.The inauguration ceremony of the bridge finally took place on 18 March 2017. Starting from 08:00 on 20 March 2017, the bridge has been open to members of the public.\n\nThe widespread Brazilian Portuguese expression \"\"do Oiapoque ao Chuí\"\" (\"from the Oyapock to the Chuí [rivers]\") is used to refer to the whole nation, by mentioning the waterways that mark respectively the northern and southern extremities of the Brazilian coastline (as noted above, they are often mistaken for the entire country's northern and southern extreme points). Thus, the saying is used in the same way as Americans use the expression \"from coast to coast.\"\n\n"}

He was part of the British small press comics scene in the 1980s.\n\nAfter contributing spot illustrations to comic fanzines such as \"Bemusing\" and \"The Panelologist\" in the mid 70's, Elliott decided to try his hand at publishing his own fanzine and, with the help of Ian Wieczorek and Paul Chester released \"Blitzine\", followed by \"Delapsus Resurgam\". In 1977 Elliott, with co-editors John Matthews (a fellow comic artist) and Ian Wieczorek, published the comic fanzine, \"Elipse\". \"Elipse\" ran for three issues and printed early strips by Kev F Sutherland, Mike Matthews, and Dave Hine as well as Elliott himself. \"Elipse\" was a unique fanzine at the time, featuring solely comic strips.\n\nIn the early 1980s Elliott became re-acquainted with an old comic collecting friend, Paul Gravett, who was working on \"Pssst!\" magazine. Unable to get his work published in \"Pssst!\", Elliott decided to return to self-publishing and, with Ian Wieczorek again, released the \"Fast Fiction\" comic, which took its name from the Fast Fiction comics distribution service.\n\nOne of the artists Phil chose to publish in \"Fast Fiction\" was Eddie Campbell. Elliott collaborated with Campbell between 1984 and 1986 on various comic strips that ran in the music paper \"Sounds\" and drew the first issue of Campbell's \"Lucifer\". Elliott was also responsible for colouring many of the covers of Campbell's comics for Harrier Comics.\n\nElliott also formed a strong creative partnership with Glenn Dakin, which resulted in comics such as \"Greenhouse Warriors\", \"Mr Night\" and \"The Man from Cancer\".\n\nElliott was a regular contributor to the influential UK comic magazine \"Escape\", and in 1985 \"Escape\" published his \"Doc Chaos\" comic. \"Doc Chaos\" was written by Dave Thorpe and Lawrence Gray.\n\nIn 1985 Elliott began drawing \"The Suttons\" for his local newspaper, \"The Maidstone Star\". This comic strip ran for three years.\n\nAfter handing over the editorship of \"Fast Fiction\" to Ed Pinsent, Elliott began editing \"!GAG!\" for Harrier Comics. Harrier Comics also published Elliott and Paul Duncan's four-issue \"Second City\" comic as well as two collections of Elliott's \"A Tale from Gimbley\" stories, \"Some Tales From Gimbley\" and \"More Tales From Gimbley\".\n\nElliott has worked in some capacity for most of the major comic publishers in the US and UK.

At 459 km in length, it is the longest river on the Malay Peninsula. The river begins at the confluence of Jelai and Tembeling rivers on the Titiwangsa Mountains and drains into the South China Sea.\n\nFrom the upper slopes of Titiwangsa Mountains at Cameron Highlands, Jelai river flows in a southeasterly direction, passing through Padang Tengku and Kuala Lipis before merging with Tembeling river. Tembeling River which begins at Pahang and Terengganu state border at Ulu Tembeling, flows in a southwesterly direction passing through Kuala Tahan. Pahang River flows in a southerly direction passing through Jerantut Feri, Kuala Krau, Kerdau and Temerloh. At Mengkarak, the river turns to the northeast, passing through Chenor and then turning east at Lubuk Paku and Lepar into the floodplain of Paloh Hinai, Pekan and Kuala Pahang before draining into the South China Sea.\n\nFrom the source to the mouth, Pahang River basin comprises almost all the districts in Pahang, including Cameron Highlands, Lipis, Jerantut, Temerloh, Bera, Maran and Pekan. Lipis River, a tributary of Jelai River, begins at Pahang and Perak state border in Ulu Sungai, Raub district and ends at the confluence of Jelai River and Lipis River at Kuala Lipis. Semantan River, a tributary of Pahang River begins in Bentong district and ends at the confluence of Pahang River and Semantan River at Kuala Semantan. Triang River and Bera River, tributaries of Pahang River begin at Jelebu and Jempol district of Negeri Sembilan state while Lepar River, another tributary of Pahang River, passing through Kuantan district in the east before ending at the confluence of Pahang River and Lepar River at Paloh Hinai.\n\nThe only district in Pahang that does not have a tributary of the Pahang River or have Pahang River flowing through it is Rompin.\n\nThe banks of Pahang River were settled as early as 1400 by warriors and seafarers from around Maritime Southeast Asia including places such as Aceh, Riau, Palembang and Sulawesi. The earliest historical records of Pahang River, the riverine inhabitants or the people of Pahang were found in the Malay Annals and Hikayat Munshi Abdullah.\n\nThe Pahang and Muar Rivers were nearly connected at a place called Jempol, in Negeri Sembilan as the Serting River flows into the Bera River, a tributary of the Pahang River. Jempol River flows into Muar River. Trading boats from the Muar could continue their journey until they reached Kuala Pahang in Pekan, or Kuala Lipis to continue into Terengganu, Kelantan or Perak.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene epoch or Mesolithic period about 10,000 years ago, there was a 5 degrees Celsius drop in the global temperature. At mountaintops, snow accumulated as ice caps and glaciers (including Mount Kinabalu), thus disrupting the global hydrological cycle. Due to lack of water discharge into the sea, the sea level was 120 meters lower than it is today. The South China Sea dried up, exposing the Sunda Shelf and previous deep trenches became huge ancient rivers called the North Sunda River.\n\nMainland Asia, the Malay Peninsular, Sumatra and Java became connected to Borneo via the landbridge of exposed Sunda Shelf. The North Sunda River provided vital connection to Mekong River in Vietnam and Chao Phraya River in Thailand to the north, Baram and Rajang rivers in Sarawak to the east and Pahang River and Rompin River to the west of the massive land mass. Freshwater catfishes from those rivers migrated and mated to exchange their genetic materials about 10,000 years ago. Thus, after the Holocene, when the temperature increased, a substantial amount of the ice that had accumulated melted, increasing sea levels, inundating the landbridges and Sunda River, thus isolating the catfish populations. However, their genetic motives are still in the DNA as an evidence of the previous connections of Pahang River to other isolated rivers in Indochina and Borneo.\n\nJerantut is 15 km from the confluence of Jelai river and Tembeling River. Temerloh is situated on the confluence between Semantan River and Pahang River. The town of Pekan, which is Pahang's royal town, is situated on the southern bank of the river, near the river mouth.\n\nThere are 7 bridges were built across the river. The bridges are Abu Bakar Bridge in Pekan, Paloh Hinai bridge of Tun Razak Highway in Paloh Hinai, Chenor Bridge in Chenor, new Temerloh Bridge in Temerloh, Semantan Bridge of East Coast Expressway in Sanggang, Sultan Ahmad Shah Bridge in Kuala Krau and Sultan Abdullah Bridge in Jerantut Feri.\n\nBera is the only district on Pahang River watershed that has no bridge crossing the river.\n\n\n\n"}

The rules also forbid the usage of celestial weapons (divine weapons bestowed by the gods) on ordinary soldiers (as opposed to soldiers of noble birth). The build-up of weapons and armies is done with the full knowledge of the opposing side and no surprise attacks are made. \n\nThe rules of engagement also set out how warriors were to deal with noncombatants. No one should attack an enemy who has temporarily lost or dropped their weapon. The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers were also sacred. Pillaging the land was forbidden. \n\nDharma-yuddha also signifies that the war is not fought for gain or selfish reasons.

{"id": "1899972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1899972", "title": "Nuclear sharing", "text": "Nuclear sharing\n\nNuclear sharing is a concept in NATO's policy of nuclear deterrence, which involves member countries without nuclear weapons of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO. In particular, it provides for the armed forces of those countries to be involved in delivering nuclear weapons in the event of their use.\n\nAs part of nuclear sharing, the participating countries carry out consultations and make common decisions on nuclear weapons policy, maintain technical equipment (notably nuclear-capable airplanes) required for the use of nuclear weapons and store nuclear weapons on their territory. In case of war, the United States told NATO allies the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) would no longer be controlling.\n\nOf the three nuclear powers in NATO (France, the United Kingdom and the United States), only the United States is known to have provided weapons for nuclear sharing. , Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are hosting U.S. nuclear weapons as part of NATO's nuclear sharing policy. Canada hosted weapons under the control of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), rather than NATO, until 1984, having left the NATO program in 1972 and Greece until 2001. The United Kingdom also received U.S. tactical nuclear weapons such as nuclear artillery and Lance missiles until 1992, even though the UK is a nuclear-weapon state in its own right; these were mainly deployed in Germany.\n\nIn peacetime, the nuclear weapons stored in non-nuclear countries are guarded by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and previously, some nuclear artillery and missile systems were guarded by United States Army (USA) personnel; the Permissive Action Link codes required for arming them remain under American control. In case of war, the weapons are to be mounted on the participating countries' warplanes. The weapons are under custody and control of USAF Munitions Support Squadrons co-located on NATO main operating bases who work together with the host nation forces.\n, 150 tactical B61 nuclear bombs are believed to be deployed in Europe under the nuclear sharing arrangement. The weapons are stored within a vault in hardened aircraft shelters, using the USAF WS3 Weapon Storage and Security System. The delivery warplanes used are F-16s and Panavia Tornados.\nHistorically, the shared nuclear weapon delivery systems were not restricted to bombs. Greece used Nike-Hercules Missiles as well as A-7 Corsair II attack aircraft. Canada had Bomarc nuclear-armed anti-aircraft missiles, Honest John surface-to-surface missiles and the AIR-2 Genie nuclear-armed air-to-air rocket, as well as tactical nuclear bombs for the CF-104 fighter. PGM-19 Jupiter medium-range ballistic missiles were shared with Italian air force units and Turkish units with U.S. dual key systems to enable the warheads. PGM-17 Thor intermediate-range ballistic missiles were forward deployed to the UK with RAF crews. An extended version of nuclear sharing, the NATO Multilateral Force was a plan to equip NATO surface ships of the member states with UGM-27 Polaris missiles, but the UK ended up purchasing the Polaris missiles and using its own warheads, and the plan to equip NATO surface ships was abandoned.\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, the nuclear weapon types shared within NATO were reduced to tactical nuclear bombs deployed by Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA). According to the press, Eastern European Member States of NATO have resisted the withdrawal of the shared nuclear bombs from Europe, fearing it would show a weakening of U.S. commitment to defend Europe against Russia.\n\nIn Italy, B61 bombs are stored at the Ghedi Air Base and at the Aviano Air Base. According to the former Italian President Francesco Cossiga, Italy's plans of retaliation during the Cold War consisted of dropping nuclear weapons on Prague (Czechoslovakia) and Budapest (Hungary) in case of a first strike of the Soviets against NATO members. He acknowledged the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Italy, and speculated about the possible presence of British and French nuclear weapons.\n\nThe only German nuclear base is located in Büchel Air Base, near the border with Luxembourg. The base has 11 Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS) equipped with WS3 Vaults for storage of nuclear weapons, each with a maximum capacity of 44 B61 nuclear bombs. There are 20 B61 bombs stored on the base for delivery by German PA-200 Tornado IDS bombers of the JaBoG 33 squadron. By 2024 Germany's Tornado IDS aircraft are due to be retired, and it is unclear what nuclear sharing role, if any, Germany will then retain.\nOn 10 June 2013, former Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers confirmed the existence of 22 shared nuclear bombs at Volkel Air Base. This was inadvertently confirmed again in June 2019 when a public draft report to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly was discovered to reference the existence of US nuclear weapons at Volkel, as well as locations in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Turkey. A new version of the report was released on 11 July 2019 without reference to the locations of the weapons\n\nIn 2017 due to an increasingly unstable relationship between the United States and Turkey it was suggested that the United States consider removing 50 tactical nuclear weapons stored under American control at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. The presence of US nuclear weapons in Turkey gained increased public attention in October 2019 with the deterioration of relations between the two nations after the Turkish military incursion into Syria.\n\n\nIt is common belief among foreign officials that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have an understanding in which Pakistan would supply the kingdom with warheads if security in the Persian Gulf was threatened. A Western official told \"The Times\" that Saudi Arabia could have the nuclear warheads in a matter of days of approaching Pakistan. Pakistan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Naeem Khan, was quoted as saying, \"Pakistan considers the security of Saudi Arabia not just as a diplomatic or an internal matter but as a personal matter.\" Naeem also said that the Saudi leadership considered Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to be one country and that any threat to Saudi Arabia is also a threat to Pakistan. Other vendors were also likely to enter into a bidding war if Riyadh indicated that it was seeking nuclear warheads. Both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have denied the existence of any such agreement. Western intelligence sources have told \"The Guardian\" that \"the Saudi monarchy paid for up to 60% of the Pakistani nuclear programme, and in return has the option to buy a small nuclear arsenal ('five to six warheads') off the shelf\". Saudi Arabia has potential dual-purpose delivery infrastructure, including Tornado IDS and F-15S fighter bombers and improved Chinese CSS-2 intermediate range ballistic missiles with accuracy sufficient for nuclear warheads but delivered with high explosive warheads.\n\nIn November 2013, a variety of sources told BBC Newsnight that Saudi Arabia was able to obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan at will. The new-report further stated, according to western experts, it was alleged that Pakistan's defense sector, including its missile and defense labs, had received plentiful financial assistance from Saudi Arabia. Gary Samore, an adviser to Barack Obama, said, \"I do think that the Saudis believe that they have some understanding with Pakistan that, in extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan.\" Amos Yadlin, formerly head of Israeli military intelligence, said \"They already paid for the bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need to bring.\"\n\nAccording to the US based think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the BBC report on possible nuclear sharing between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is partially incorrect. There is no indication of the validity or credibility of the BBC's sources, and the article fails to expand on what essentially constitutes an unverified lead. Furthermore, if Pakistan were to transfer nuclear warheads onto Saudi soil, it is highly unlikely that either nation would face any international repercussions if both nations were to follow strict nuclear sharing guidelines like those of NATO. A research paper produced by the British House of Commons Defence Select Committee states that as long as current NATO nuclear sharing arrangements remain in place, the NATO states would have few valid grounds for complaint if such a transfer were to occur.\n\nBoth the Non-Aligned Movement and critics within NATO believe that NATO's nuclear sharing violates Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which prohibit the transfer and the acceptance of direct or indirect control, respectively, over nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States insists that its forces control the weapons and that no transfer of the nuclear bombs or control over them is intended \"unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the NPT would no longer be controlling\", so there is no breach of the NPT. However, the pilots and other staff of the \"non-nuclear\" NATO countries practice handling and delivering the US nuclear bombs, and non-US warplanes have been adapted to deliver US nuclear bombs which involved the transfer of some technical nuclear weapons information. Even if the US argument is considered legally correct, some argue such peacetime operations appear to contravene both the objective and the spirit of the NPT. Essentially, all preparations for waging nuclear war have already been made by supposedly non-nuclear weapon states.\n\nAt the time the NPT was being negotiated, the NATO nuclear sharing agreements were secret. These agreements were disclosed to some of the states, including the Soviet Union, negotiating the treaty along with the NATO arguments for not treating them as proliferation. Most of the states that signed the NPT in 1968 would not have known about these agreements and interpretations at that time.\n\n\n"}

Portuguese forces led by Afonso Henriques defeated forces led by his mother Teresa of Portugal and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava. Following São Mamede, the future king styled himself \"Prince of Portugal\". He would be called \"King of Portugal\" in 1139 and was recognised as such by neighbouring kingdoms in 1143.\n\nIn late 11th century, Henry of Portugal, a knight and brother of the Duke of Burgundy, went to support the Christians of Hispania. He fought the Moors along with Alfonso VI of León. In honour of his fights in Hispania, the King gave him the County of Portugal. This gift came with a reinstated title; because of attempts by the previous holder some years earlier to assert independence, it had been suppressed. Henry became count of Portugal and Theresa, one of Alfonso's daughters, his wife. \n\nIn 1095, the county was a dependency of the Kingdom of Galicia, itself a dependency of the Kingdom of León. In 1097 Portugal became a direct dependency of León. However, from the early years of his rule, as he became influenced by the desire of the lords of the county for independence, Henry desired the independence of the county. \n\nHenry died in 1112, and his wife \"Regina Tarasia\" (Queen Theresa, as she addressed herself) became the countess of Portugal. She also wished for independence from her sister, Urraca, who became Queen of León after her father's, Alfonso VI of Leon, death. Like her husband, Theresa was also ambitious. In an attempt to maintain the autonomy of her county, she allied herself to her sister's enemies or with her sister, whichever was most propitious at the time.\n\nIn 1116, the Portuguese took two Galician cities, Tui and Ourense. In reply, the sister of Countess Theresa, Queen Urraca, attacked Theresa's dominions. Bishop Diego Gelmírez, a friend of a Galician noble that was in the service of Theresa, led a revolt in the camp of Queen Urraca, and she was obliged to make peace with her sister Theresa.\n\nUrraca died in 1126. Urraca's son, Alfonso VII, became king of León and Castile and demanded that Theresa become his vassal, which she refused to do. In response, Alfonso attacked Portugal in the spring of 1127. This increased the power of her son, because she had lost the trust of the Leonese king, and her son became the count of Portugal. Theresa became a puppet of the Galician Ferdinand Perez de Trava. Theresa and Prince Afonso became enemies, as both wanted to take control of the county, but only the supporters of Prince Afonso were really interested in full independence.\n\nAfonso Henriques was not alone in the battle. In fact, he was pressured by the lords of the main Portuguese cities, by the local church, and by its people to achieve the country's independence.\n\nNobles participating in the battle with Afonso Henriques:\n\nThe counts that dominated the counties of Portugal and Coimbra kept the idea of independence, and their merger strengthened their positions. Alfonso VI of León, knowing the wishes of the Portuguese, united all Galicia under a single rule of one lord, which he chose from one of his close relatives. Teresa, mother of Afonso Henriques, came to Guimarães to govern the Portuguese county. The Portuguese did not accept this, and the battle started. Afonso won the battle and Portugal started its journey towards independence.\n\nIn 1129, Henriques declared himself \"Prince of Portugal\" and in 1139 as \"King of Portugal\". León finally recognized Portugal's independence in 1143 in the Treaty of Zamora. In 1179, the Holy See declared him King, de jure.\n\n\n\n"}

He played five seasons in the North American-based National Hockey League (NHL), and is to date the only Norwegian to have played in the NHL All-Star Game. In his native Norway, Knutsen is also known by the nickname \"Shampoo\" because his father is a hairdresser, and also a former hockey player whose nickname was \"The Soap\" (Såpa in Norwegian).\n\nAfter being drafted by the Hartford Whalers in the 10th round (204th overall) in 1990, Knutsen remained in Europe until 1997, playing for his hometown team Vålerenga, and later Djurgården of the Swedish Elitserien. In 1996, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim acquired his rights, and he made his debut with the Ducks in 1997. After a disappointing season (playing in part for the American Hockey League (AHL) Cincinnati Mighty Ducks), Knutsen returned to Djurgården. During the 1999–00 season, he was the highest paid player in the Elitserien, earning a salary of $280,000.\n\nKnutsen got a second chance in the NHL in 2000, when he signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets on the recommendation of assistant coach George Kingston, who had previously coached the Norwegian national team. In a very good first season, Knutsen tallied 53 points (11 goals, 42 assists) in 66 games. His numbers dropped a little the next season, but he was nonetheless named to the World Team (as an injury replacement) in the 2002 All-Star Game (making him the first Norwegian ever to play in the NHL All-Star Game). The 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons were disappointing for Knutsen, who spent large parts of the seasons on the injured list. He left the NHL in early 2004, shortly after being assigned to Columbus' AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, and once again returned to Djurgården.\n\nKnutsen retired because of injury in July 2005. At the news of his retirement, the general manager of Djurgården, Tommy Engström, called him one of the greatest players in the history of the club.

In addition to Bristol, he played for French sides Stade Français and Racing Métro after leaving Argentine team CASI from San Isidro in 1997. In 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame. He was Vice-Chairman of World Rugby between 2016 and 2020.\n\nPichot made his debut for Los Pumas in April 1996 during the Pumas' tour to Australia, scoring a try in the first Test in Brisbane. Pichot was capped another three times that year for the Pumas; playing in Tests against Romania, Italy and France during October. The following year he was capped another three times for Argentina, playing two Tests against France and one against Uruguay in June, scoring a try in the match against Uruguay. In October/November of the next year, he earned another four Test caps, playing in matches against Italy, France and the Wallabies, scoring a try in the second of two matches against the Wallabies. He moved from CASI to Richmond, and later switched to Bristol. \n\nPichot would be capped six times during the 1998 international season, including playing France three times, as well as playing matches against Italy, Romania and Wales, scoring tries in the games against Wales and Romania. In the lead up to the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales Pichot played two Tests against the hosts in June, and Tests against Scotland and Ireland that August, scoring a try in the Test against Ireland.

Argentina played France in their quarter-final, which France won 26–47, Pichot being one of Argentina's try scorers in the match.\n\nAfter the World Cup Pichot captained Argentina for the first time in a Test against Ireland in June 2000, which Argentina won 34 points to 23. He was also capped another four times that year, playing two games against World Champions Australia and then matches against South Africa and England in November. He earned eight Test caps during 2001, and captained Argentina on three more occasions, in matches against Uruguay, the United States and Canada in May.

Although originally a session player in many bands, Emmanuel has carved out his own style as a solo artist, releasing award-winning albums and singles. In the May 2008 and 2010 issues of \"Guitar Player\" magazine, he was named \"Best Acoustic Guitarist\" in its readers' poll. In June 2010 Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). In 2011, Emmanuel was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown.\n\nOne of six children, Emmanuel was born in Muswellbrook, New South Wales, Australia, in 1955. He received his first guitar in 1959 at age four and was taught by his mother to accompany her playing lap steel guitar. At the age of six in 1961, he heard Chet Atkins playing on the radio. He vividly remembers that moment and said it greatly inspired him as a musician.\n\nBy the age of six, he was a working professional musician. Recognizing the musical talents of Emmanuel and his older brother, Phil, their father created a family band, sold their home, and took his family on the road. With the family living in two station wagons, much of Emmanuel's childhood was spent touring Australia, playing rhythm guitar, and rarely going to school. After their father died in 1966, Australian Country Music star Buddy Williams approached the family and asked permission to take the Emmanuel brothers on the road with his touring show travelling around Australia. Tommy Emmanuel would go on to record on a number of Buddy Williams albums in the early 1970's. Eventually the New South Wales Department of Education insisted that the Emmanuel children had to go to school regularly.\n\nThe Emmanuels eventually settled in Parkes. Tommy Emmanuel eventually moved to Sydney, where he was noticed nationally when he won a string of talent contests in his teen years. By the late 1970s, he was playing drums with his brother Phil in the group Goldrush as well as doing session work on numerous albums and jingles. He gained further prominence in the late 1970s as the lead guitarist in the Southern Star Band, the backing group for vocalist Doug Parkinson. During 1985–1988 and 1995, he joined in 1982 reformed lineup of the leading New Zealand/Australian 1970s rock group Dragon, touring widely with them, including a 1987 tour with Tina Turner; he left the group to embark on a solo career.\n\nIn 1994, Australian music veteran John Farnham invited him to play guitar next to Stuart Fraser from Noiseworks for the \"Concert for Rwanda\". Emmanuel had previously been a member of Farnham's band during the early 1980s and featured on the album \"Uncovered\", and rejoined after the 1994 concert.\n\nIn July 1999, Chet Atkins commented that Emmanuel was a \"fearless\" fingerpicking guitar player and awarded Tommy and four others (John Knowles, Marcel Dadi, Jerry Reed, and Steve Wariner) the \"Certified Guitar Player\" title.\n\nEmmanuel and his brother Phil performed live in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics in 2000. The event was televised worldwide with an estimated 2.85 billion viewers.\n\nIn December 2007, he was diagnosed with heart problems and was forced to take a break from his hectic touring schedule due to exhaustion but returned to full-time touring in early 2008. In 2009 he worked with fellow local artists, Ray Burgess, Marty Rhone, John St Peeters and John \"Swanee\" Swan to release a single, \"Legends of the Southern Land\".\n\nIn June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).\n\nAt the 2011 ‘TommyFest’, Tommy took the chance to talk to the audience about his strong Christian faith.\n“The Lord is my shepherd, so I lack nothing—it’s true!” he told the gathered crowds.\nIn 2012, Governor Steve Beshear awarded Emmanuel the state of Kentucky's honorific title of Kentucky Colonel.\n\nDuring a July 2019 concert he mentioned recently receiving American citizenship.\n\nEmmanuel had said that even at a young age he was fascinated by Chet Atkins's musical style (sometimes referred to as Travis picking) of playing bass lines, chords, melodies, and harmonies simultaneously using the thumb and fingers of the right hand, achieving a dynamic range of sound from the instrument. Although Emmanuel's playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles, including jazz, blues, bluegrass, folk and rock, this type of country finger-style playing is at the core of his technique. While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music, his natural musical ability, intrinsic sense of rhythm, and charisma gained him fans from all over the world. As a solo performer, he never plays to a set list and uses a minimum of effects onstage. He usually completes studio recordings in one take.\n\nIn his solo shows, he mainly plays guitars made by Maton, an Australian guitar manufacturer. He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model, both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature models. He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador to the company due to his long-standing association with the brand. Emmanuel is known for the battered and worn-down appearances of his guitars; a result of his dynamic, energetic playing and percussive techniques. One of his signature performances, for example, involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummer's snare-drum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit.\n\nEmmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E), while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to D-G-D-G-B-E (G6 tuning) and his TE1 to C-F-B-E-G-C. He generally uses 0.12 gauge (light) strings on one EBG808 and 0.13 gauge (medium) strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1. This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed, rather than spending time onstage re-tuning one guitar.\n\nEmmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the fretboard to play some notes, rather than using only his fingers to play — contrary to how classical guitarists play, but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists. He frequently plays common three-finger chord shapes with just two fingers. He commonly uses a thumbpick, a flat pick (plectrum), his fingers, or a combination of these in his playing, a style known as hybrid picking. Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions, he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitar's tremolo system on acoustic guitar — by pressing the palm of his right hand against the sound board of the guitar near the neck joint, while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the headstock. The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound.\n\nAs a young man in Australia, Emmanuel wrote to his hero Chet Atkins in Nashville, Tennessee. Eventually Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a long-standing invitation to drop by to visit.\n\nIn 1997, Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo, releasing the album \"The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World\". It would be Atkins's last album. Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on The Nashville Network's 'Country Christmas' in late 1997, and on that occasion Atkins stated about him: \"He is one of the greatest guitar players I've ever seen.\" Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith recorded \"Guitar Boogie\", one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuel's shows.\n\nIn July 1999, at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Convention, Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award, an honor Chet personally bestowed to only four guitarists. This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself, a widely recognized leader in guitar music. The award states: \"In Recognition of His Contributions to the Art of Fingerpicking.\" Tommy performed at the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society (CAAS) in July each year in Nashville.\n\nIn addition to being influenced by Chet Atkins, Emmanuel has stated that guitarist Hank Marvin is his mentor.\n\nHis rendition of \"Classical Gas\" by Mason Williams was used on the animated television series \"American Dad!\" in the season 10 episode entitled \"Permanent Record Wrecker\". It was played by Roger Smith in a coffee shop guitar battle.\n\n\nThe APRA Awards (Australia) are annual awards to recognise composing and song writing skills, sales, and airplay performance by its members annually.\nThe Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards, commonly known as ARIA Music Awards are held to recognise excellence and innovation and achievement across all genres of Australian music. Award nominees and winners, excluding for sales and public voted categories, are selected by the ARIA Academy comprising \"judges from all sectors of the music industry - retail, radio and tv, journalists and critics, television presenters, concert promoters, agents, ARIA member record companies and past ARIA winners\". The inaugural ARIA Awards took place in 1987.\n\nThe Country Music Awards of Australia (CMAA) is an annual awards night held in January during the Tamworth Country Music Festival since 1973.\n\nThe Grammy Awards is an annual award presentation by The Recording Academy to recognize achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.\n\n"}

He was a rugby union footballer who played fly-half or centre; his last club was Club Newman, in the first division of the URBA championship. He was also a key player for Argentina, having played 15 years for the national team. His twin brother Manuel was also a \"Puma\". In June 2015 he was appointed coach of Argentina XV. Contepomi was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in November 2017.\n\nBorn 20 August 1977 in Buenos Aires, Contepomi started playing rugby for his secondary school Colegio Cardenal Newman, and then for Club Newman in Buenos Aires. In 2003 he joined Leinster from Bristol on a four-year contract following Bristol's relegation in the 2002–03 Zurich Premiership.\n\nHe played a major role in Leinster's run in the 2005–06 Heineken Cup, helping Leinster to a 41–35 win over Cup holders Toulouse, scoring 21 points in the process and winning the man of the match award. That year he was top scorer in both the 2005–06 Celtic League and the Heineken Cup.\n\nIn late January 2006, Contepomi's former girlfriend, Paula, gave birth to their daughter, Catalina. Only hours later, Contepomi played for Leinster the Celtic League match against the Border Reivers, a game in which he went on to score 22 points.\n\nIn November of that year, Agustín Pichot said that Contepomi was a better player than All Black fly-half, Dan Carter, the winner of the 2005 IRB International Player of the Year award.\n\nOn 31 May 2007, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in Dublin conferred him with the medical degrees of MB BCh BAO (NUI) LRCP&SI. He subsequently worked in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.\n\nContepomi won the 2007 Rugby Writers of Ireland Player of the Year award. While playing at Leinster, his nominal 'local club' of origin was County Carlow Co Carlow Football Club, a provincial side which later got into financial difficulties and is now a minor Junior concern.\n\nOn 12 March 2009, it was announced that Contepomi would be leaving Leinster at the end of the season, and that he had signed a 4-year deal to join French side RC Toulon from the 2009–10 Top 14 season.\n\nContepomi played a role in the Leinster win over Munster in the Heineken Cup semi-final on 2 May 2009. After scoring a drop goal after 15 minutes in, he was helped off the pitch after suffering a knee injury half an hour in. An MRI scan confirmed he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out of action for 6 months post-op. Almost exactly on schedule, he made his Toulon debut on 21 November against Brive, coming off the bench and scoring a penalty in Toulon's 19–10 win.\n\nContepomi left RC Toulon to take the fly-half position at Stade Français in time for the 2011–12 season.\n\nContepomi was one of the stars of world rugby and was also set to lead the Argentina national team into a new era after being named captain in 2008. The former U19, U21 and Sevens international made his Pumas debut against Chile in 1998 and has been an integral part of Argentinean rugby ever since.\n\nThe multi-talented Contepomi made his international break-through at fly-half and while he has played much of his rugby in that position he recently has found his place at inside centre with Juan Martin Hernandez preferred at No.10.\n\nHe was named in José Luis Imhoff and Alex Wyllie's squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup squad, where the Pumas made the quarter-finals for the first time. Marcelo Loffreda took charge of the national side in 2000 and Contepomi retained his place, eventually nailing down a starting berth 2001.\n\nHe notably notched a full house on his way to 25 points in the 30–16 victory over Wales in Cardiff on 10 November 2001. He was also part of the 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, featuring in three of the Pumas' pool games as they were forced to play four games in a fortnight.\n\nIn 2004, Contepomi weighed in with 14 points as Argentina condemned France to their first defeat at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille. He also faced the British & Irish Lions in 2005 and at the end of 2006 he was part of the Pumas side that scored their first ever victory over England at Twickenham.\n\nThe Pumas stunned the rugby world with an inspired performance at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. Contepomi was a key player throughout the campaign – featuring in all seven matches as the Pumas claimed third place in the sport's global showpiece.\n\nHe was the second highest points scorer in the tournament – notably kicking four penalties in the shock opening victory over hosts France and 11 points in both the pool victory over Ireland and the quarter-final against Scotland. Contepomi was nominated by the IRB as one of five candidates for the 2007 International Player of the Year award, which was won by Bryan Habana.\n\nFollowing the retirement of veteran scrum-half Agustín Pichot, Contepomi was handed the captaincy of the Pumas in 2008 by new coach Santiago Phelan ahead of the opening clash of the year against Scotland.\n\nA knee injury suffered in Leinster's Heineken Cup semi-final victory over Munster in 2009 ruled him out of action for over a year but he returned to Pumas colours in 2010 and won a 31-point haul in their 41–13 victory over Six Nations champions France.\n\nHe was part of the Argentine squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand playing as captain.\n\nContepomi played his last international game with Argentina on Saturday 5 October 2013 in Rosario, Santa Fe, against Australia during The Rugby Championship. At the time of his retirement, Contepomi achieved the most test matches played for Argentina (87) and the most points scored in international games (651). He worked with his father in their medical practice in Buenos Aires and as assistant coach in the Super XV for new Argentine franchise Jaguares (Super Rugby).\n\nContepomi joined Argentina XV in 2015 as a head coach alongside Ricardo Le Fort. In 2018, he was appointed as new Backs Coach to Leinster, succeeding Girvan Dempsey, who moved to Bath.\n\n\n\n\n<BR>\n"}

Seikaly was one of the first internationally-born players to make an impact on American basketball. Considered one of the top college players from the Syracuse basketball program, Seikaly's stellar offense and defense placed him among the school's all-time leaders in rebounds, points and blocks, while earning several nationally recognized awards and honors. His number 4 jersey was retired by Syracuse and raised to the rafters of the Carrier Dome.\n\nDrafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA) by the Miami Heat with the 9th pick of the 1988 draft and the first ever pick for the Heat, Seikaly ranked among the team's top offensive and defensive contributors–winning NBA player of the week twice–and also amassing many of the team's records (of which some are still standing). Seikaly earned the 1990 NBA Most Improved Player Award and later played for the Golden State Warriors, Orlando Magic and New Jersey Nets and in Spain with FC Barcelona. He was also part of the United States national basketball team during the 1986 FIBA World Championship, winning gold. After his retirement from basketball, Seikaly became a successful real estate developer. He also worked in electronic music as a producer/DJ and hosts a radio, show \"Sugar Free Radio\", on Sirius/XM.\n\nSeikaly was born in Beirut, Lebanon. As a young child, he moved from Beirut to Greece, where he spent the rest of his youth.\n\nHe attended and graduated from the American School, also known as ACS Athens. In addition to playing basketball, he also excelled in many different sports including volleyball, soccer, and track & field.\n\nAfter being scouted by Panathinaikos player Takis Koroneos, Seikaly at age 16 was selected to join Panathinaikos' men's senior team, and played with them in a tournament in Cyprus.\n\nIn 1984, Seikaly moved from Greece to the United States and began attending Syracuse University in central New York, where he played college basketball. He played center for the Syracuse Orange men's basketball team. He led his Syracuse team to the 1987 NCAA Tournament championship finals against the Indiana Hoosiers during his junior year, after averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds per game throughout the tournament. He was an All-American, and was also named to the John R. Wooden All-American Team. He graduated from Syracuse as the school's all-time leading rebounder, second in school history in blocked shots, and fourth in school history in scoring. At the time, he was only the second player ever to record 1,000 points and rebounds during his tenure at Syracuse. He was named to the Orange's All 20th Century Team, and his number 4 jersey has been retired and raised to the rafters at the Carrier Dome.\n\nSeikaly was taken by the Miami Heat with the 9th pick in the first round of the 1988 NBA draft. As well as being the franchise's first ever college draft pick, Seikaly became the first player born in Lebanon to compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe rookie center quickly emerged not only as a pivotal player within the team, but also among the league's top centers. In his second season, he led the Heat in points (16.6), rebounds (10.4) and blocks (1.7) while placing sixth in the league in rebounding. At the conclusion of the season he was awarded with the NBA Most Improved Player Award.\n\nIn the 1990–91 season, Seikaly increased his rebounding average to 11.1 rebounds per game while maintaining his 16 points per game average and then they acquired other young players to serve as scoring options such as Glen Rice and Steve Smith. In the 1991–92 season, Seikaly again averaged 16 points and 11 rebounds (6th in the league) as the Heat, bolstered by his play and Rice's scoring, led the team to 38 wins and the first playoff berth for the franchise. Despite the breakthrough, Miami was no match for the defending champions, the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, who swept the Heat in three games. For the series against the Bulls, Seikaly averaged 19.1 points with 9.2 rebounds.\n\nSeikaly increased his scoring to 17.3 and once again averaged 11.8 rebounds a game (8th in the league) during the 1992–93 season. He managed to win the NBA player of the week after averaging 30 points and 20 Rebounds for the week of March 7. The following season featured increased scoring by Rice and Smith, and Seikaly averaged 15.1 points a game for third on the team while leading the team in rebounds with 10.3 rebounds per game. The Heat won 42 games, good enough to make the playoffs. Facing off against the Atlanta Hawks in the first round.\n\nSeikaly's career with Miami saw him setting numerous team records, including blocks (8), rebounds (34) and double–doubles. During his run with the Heat, he had the nickname \"The Spin Doctor\", due to his trademark low-post spin moves. On November 2, 1994, Seikaly was traded to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nHis career highs with the Heat are 40 points, 34 rebounds, 8 blocks, 8 assists, and 5 steals.\n\nSeikaly only played in 36 games during the 1994–95 season, but started in all but one of those appearances averaging 12 points and 7 rebounds per game for the Warriors who were decimated by injuries. He would go on to start in 60 of 64 games in the 95–96 season, averaging 12 points and 7.8 rebounds, but the Warriors once again were plagued by injuries and could not reach the playoffs. In November 1996, he was once again traded, this time to the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Magic had been a dominant Eastern Conference team, but lost superstar center Shaquille O'Neal, and Seikaly was brought in to fill the void. Despite playing alongside other veteran scorers such as Horace Grant, Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott, Seikaly boosted his scoring to 17.3 points per game for second on the team behind All-Star Penny Hardaway, and led the team in rebounds per game (9.5) and blocks (1.4). The Magic won 45 games and entered the playoffs as the 7th seed in the conference, facing off against Seikaly's old team in Miami, who now featured an All-Star center Alonzo Mourning. Despite taking a 2–0 lead in Miami, the Magic responded with two wins at home to tie the series at 2 games apiece, but injuries forced Seikaly out of the 4th and deciding 5th games in which the Heat won to advance.\n\nSeikaly would start in 47 games to start the 1997–98 season, but in February he was traded to the New Jersey Nets. He averaged 16 points and 9.5 rebounds per game in his stint in Orlando.\n\nFollowing his arrival in New Jersey, Seikaly had a career ending foot injury and only played in 9 games to finish the 1997–98 season, and would only play in 9 games of the lockout shortened 1998–99 season before retiring from the league. He holds NBA career averages of 14.7 points per game, 9.5 rebounds per game, and 1.3 blocks per game.\n\nSeikaly played with the Spanish League club FC Barcelona Basket, during the 2000–01 season. He averaged 15.3 points and 8.0 rebounds per game in the Spanish League.\n\nSeikaly, an avid lover of music, started DJing on and off at the age of 14 while living in Athens. After retiring from basketball, he developed his passion into a musical career as a professional DJ and a music producer. \"Sports will always be my love. But music will always be my passion,\" he said. He also had his own studio in Florida. Seikaly has been producing and working in the genres of house, deep house, tech house and techno. He has played in many major clubs in the world including Ibiza, Beirut, New York, Toronto, LA and Miami.\n\nHe has released many EPs including, \"House Calls\" in 2010 \"East West EP\" in 2012 and East West EP volume 2 in 2014, \"Holdin On\" in 2015 \"Signs EP\" in 2015 and \"The Sword EP\" in 2016 \". In 2012, he released a full mix album titled \"Nervous Nitelife Presents Rony Seikaly\" and has singles released on Suara, Yoshitoshi, Nervous, Stereo, Subliminal Records and many more.\n\nHe ran his own radio show on Sirius XM satellite radio called SugarFreeRadio which aired four days per week.\n\n\n\nSeikaly speaks four languages fluently: English, Greek, Arabic, and French. During his NBA playing career, Seikaly would return to Greece during the off-season, to visit his friends and family members. Seikaly owns a villa in Mykonos, Greece, and he still vacations there. While living in Greece, he was known as Roni Sakalis ().\n\nWhen Magic Johnson returned to the NBA HIV-positive, and there was opposition to his inclusion in the league, because of his health status, Seikaly challenged him to a game of one-on-one, to show everyone that HIV is not contagious by touch.\n\nSeikaly owns and runs a multi-million dollar real estate investment company. He is also an investor in the South Beach, Miami, restaurants Quattro, Sosta, Solea, and Club Wall.\n\nSeikaly was formerly married to Mexican model Elsa Benítez, the 2001 and 2006 cover girl for the \"Sports Illustrated\" swimsuit issues. They divorced in 2005; they have a daughter, Mila.\n\nSince July 2015, Seikaly has been married to Brazilian fashion blogger and model Martha Graeff, to whom he became engaged on the Greek island of Mykonos.\n\nSeikaly is involved in many charities, such as the Miami Heat's Corporate Education and \"Shoot for the Stars\" programs, and the Make A Wish Foundation. He also founded the Rony Seikaly Golf Tournament to benefit cystic fibrosis research.\n\nRevenues from the sale of his 2012 album, \"Nervous Nitelife Presents Rony Seikaly\", went to the Children's Department at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Foundation in Miami.\n\n\n"}

It was formed from Finnish volunteers and fought on the Eastern Front as part of the SS Division Wiking. The unit was disbanded in mid-1943 as the two-year commitment of the volunteers had expired and the Finnish Government was unwilling to allow more men to volunteer. About 1,400 men served in the battalion during its existence.\n\nThe Finnish Government recruited men for service with the Waffen-SS for a two-year term in early 1941, although negotiations over the details lasted until the end of April. This delayed their arrival until May and the roughly 400 men who had military experience in the Winter War were sent to the SS Division Wiking in mid-June where they were dispersed throughout the formation. The inexperienced volunteers were held back for training and were formed into the SS-Volunteer Battalion Northeast (motorized) () on 1 June. By the end of the month, the battalion had about 1,000 men. It was renamed the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS on 13 September and additional volunteers arrived over the next several months to bring its strength up to around 1,180 men. The unit was sent to the front at the beginning of January 1942 where it was attached to the SS-Regiment Nordland of the SS Division Wiking, serving as its third battalion. The battalion participated in the Battle of the Caucasus in mid-1942 and the subsequent Third Battle of Kharkov in early 1943, after the German defeat during the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 forced the Germans to evacuate the Caucasus.\n\nThe mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna was chairman of the Committee for the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS. 1408 men served in the battalion during its existence. The unit lost 255 men killed in action, 686 wounded and 14 missing during its service.\n\nResearch by Finnish historian Andre Swanström identified at least six Finnish Waffen-SS volunteers who had in Swanström's opinion implicated themselves in crimes, including shooting Jews in Ukraine in 1941. In one letter, an SS private wrote to an officer and military chaplain, , objecting to being on the shooting detail because \"for the execution of Jews, less skilled personnel would have sufficed\". In 2018, in response to a request from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Finnish authorities announced a committee of inquiry into the activities of the battalion. The committee's work, including by researchers of the National Archives of Finland, conclude at the end of 2018. Swanström's allegations were not new, but such allegations had only been investigated by Finnish State Police in the past, with no evidence of crimes being found. On 2 February 2019 Finnish authorities concluded that \"Finnish Waffen SS volunteers did participate in carrying out atrocities against Jews and civilians.\"\n\nIn 1968, Finnish historian Mauno Jokipii published a book \"Panttipataljoona: suomalaisen SS-pataljoonan historia\" (\"History of the Finnish SS battalion\") detailing the history of the unit. The work was influenced by the organization of the former Finnish SS men, ; in 2000, the copyright for the book was transferred to the organisation. Among others, historians and showed that, in the light of the archival material that emerged in the 2010s, Jokipii's estimates of nationalist radicals, fascists and National Socialists among its ranks was underestimated. According to Silvennoinen and Tikka, about 46 per cent of volunteers, or more than double the number compared to Jokipii's calculations, would have shown themselves to be adherents of fascist ideology. According to Swanström, 36 percent of the volunteers declared being supporters of the clerical fascist Patriotic People's Movement (IKL), while 10 per cent declared being supporters of the various minor Finnish Nazi parties and 7 per cent supporters of traditional right-wing parties. According to Swanström, the ideology of the Finnish SS men was connected to extreme Finnish nationalism and a particular Finnish form of Lutheran revivalism (\"herännäisyys\").\n\nAccording to Jokipii, the Finnish SS men did not participate in the brutal executions of Jews by the Germans, but some of them testified as eyewitnesses to murders. However, a Finnish government investigation determined in 2019 that some of the Finns alongside the Germans shot Jews and civilians.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1900027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900027", "title": "Corporate manslaughter in English law", "text": "Corporate manslaughter in English law\n\nCorporate manslaughter is a criminal offence in English law, being an act of homicide committed by a company or organisation. In general, in English criminal law, a juristic person is in the same position as a natural person, and may be convicted for committing many offences. The Court of Appeal confirmed in one of the cases following the \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" disaster that a company can, in principle, commit manslaughter, although all defendants in that case were acquitted.\n\nThe common law test to impose criminal responsibility on a company only arises where a person's gross negligence has led to another person's death and (under the \"identification doctrine\") that person is a \"controlling mind\", whose actions and intentions can be imputed to the company (that is, a person in control of the company's affairs to a sufficient degree that the company can fairly be said to think and act through him). This is tested by reference to the detailed work patterns of the manager, and the job title or description given to that person is irrelevant, but there is often no single person who acts as a \"controlling mind\", particularly in large companies, and many issues of health and safety are delegated to junior managers who are not \"controlling minds\".\n\nOn 6 March 1987, 193 people died when the \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" capsized. Although individual employees failed in their duties, the Sheen Report severely criticised the attitude to safety prevalent in P&O, stating:\n\nThere was significant institutional resistance to the appropriateness of using the criminal law in general, and homicide charges in particular in this type of situation. Judicial review of the coroner's inquest persuaded the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring manslaughter charges against P&O European Ferries and seven employees, but the trial judge ruled that there was no evidence that one sufficiently senior member of the company's management could be said to have been negligent.\n\nA subsequent appeal confirmed that corporate manslaughter is a charge known to English criminal law, and with the revival of gross negligence as a \"mens rea\" for manslaughter, it was thought that prosecutions might succeed. However, a prosecution of Great Western Trains following the Southall rail crash collapsed because \"the Crown was not in a position to satisfy the doctrine of identification\" (Turner J). Only the company itself and the train driver, Mr Larry Harrison, were prosecuted. Since the train driver is not someone of a managerial or directorial level, the case against him was dismissed in the opening arguments. Because the only other defendant was GWT, a corporation, this meant that it was impossible to identify a controlling mind for the purposes of holding an individual personally liable for manslaughter.\n\nIn English law, proving corporate manslaughter and securing a conviction of an individual where the corporation involved is a small concern are easier where it is easier to identify a \"controlling mind\" (in \"R v OLL Ltd\", 1994, about the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy, managing director Peter Kite was convicted), but efforts to convict people in larger corporate entities tends to fail as the management structure is more diffuse making this identification more difficult. Instead, the prosecution stands more chance of pursuing a case successfully if it prosecutes simply on the grounds of a safety breach under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.\n\nFollowing \"R v. Prentice\", a breach of duty amounts to 'gross negligence' when there is:\nThe Law Commission's 1996 report on involuntary manslaughter found that the gross negligence formula overcomes the problems of having to find one particular officer who has the \"mens rea\" for the offence and allows emphasis to be placed on the company's attitude to safety. This question would only arise where the company has chosen to enter a field of activity that carries a risk to others, such as transport, manufacture or medical care. The steps the company has taken to discharge the \"duty of safety\" and the systems devised for running its business, will be directly relevant. Although only expressed as a provisional view, it is significant that the Law Commission echoes here the recognition of corporate safety systems voiced in the Seaboard case. Thus, a real tension is exposed between the paradigm of criminal culpability based on individual responsibility and the increasing recognition of the potential for harm inherent in large scale corporate activity.\n\nThe government issued a consultation paper in 2000, proposing reforms to the law to implement the recommendations of the Law Commission. A draft Corporate Manslaughter Bill was published in March 2005, and the Queen's Speech on 17 May 2005 included a reference to an Act of Parliament to be passed in 2005/6 to widen the scope for prosecutions for corporate manslaughter.\n\nA Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Home Secretary John Reid on 20 July 2006 to create new offences of corporate manslaughter, in England and Wales, and corporate homicide, in Scotland. Originally, the Bill proposed that the offence would require a company's or organisation's activities to be so managed or organised \"by its senior managers\" as to cause a person's death, and to amount to a \"gross breach\" of a duty of care owed to the deceased. The requirement for the failure of management or organisation to have been \"by its senior managers\" was dropped in Standing Committee. The Bill also sought to abolish the common law offence of manslaughter by gross negligence so far as it applies to corporations. A juristic person cannot be imprisoned, but the penalty would be an unlimited fine as for the existing common law offence. The Bill received royal assent on 26 July 2007, becoming the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. The Act came into force on 6 April 2008.

An English adaptation dub was later produced and first aired in Britain on Toonami, where it ran between May 11, 2005 and October 5, 2005. The show aired in India on Cartoon Network in 2009. The series made its U.S. premiere on Cartoon Network on June 3, 2006, after it ended in most other countries.\n\nFour DVDs have been released in the United Kingdom, with a U.S. release still non-existent. All of the episodes have been released as extras on the first six-season box sets of \"Pokémon\" in Australia (the newer 6 DVD box sets do not have the \"Pokémon Chronicles\" episodes, while the older 14 DVD sets do). A box set containing all 22 episodes has also been released in Australia.\n\n\n\n\nWhen shown on Shūkan Pokémon Hōsōkyoku, the episodes did not have a musical opening. Instead, they open with Brock and Misty talking (except for the Team Rocket episodes, where said characters would talk instead). Normally, it would result in Misty hitting Brock with a mallet, fan, or water gun for acting out of line. The endings would normally deal with that episode's character. When released on DVD these sequences were omitted entirely.\nThe Japanese episodes were seen as \"special\" episodes, hence the unconventional opening. However, it was dubbed as a completely new series, so a musical opening was required. While the openings from the main series interlink scenes from the related Japanese opening with scenes from the episodes, there was no Japanese opening for Pokémon Chronicles, A new opening was created. Some of the scenes in the opening are taken from the Japanese Legend of Thunder opening, the rest are taken from episodes. There are 42 scenes in 36 seconds.\n\nThe ending is a repeat of the opening on the left of the screen, with the credits rolling past on the right. There are a few variations, however. The DVD version and first two parts of \"The Legend of Thunder\" shows footage from the battle at the start of Part Two. The ending for \"Pikachu's Winter Vacation\" on the DVD rolls over a full screen picture taken from the episode.\n\nThe original theme tune is a modified version of the \"G/S Pokerap\". However, there is an instrumental in the middle, where the narrator basically says what Chronicles is about:\n\nWhen the series aired in America, starting with the second episode, the intro sequence was changed to a newer version, consisting of a montage of various scenes from \"The Legend of Thunder\" with more intense music. In the original of \"The Legend of Thunder\", it also features a cameo by the Johto rival, and later in another episode.\n\nThe episodes have been released on DVD in a number of markets, excluding Region 1. English language releases are limited to Regions 2 and 4. If bought as standalone Volumes, Volume Three is available packaged in with Volume Two as a \"bonus Volume\". This is likely because the covers of Volumes One, Two and Four depict the evolutions of Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur, respectively. A box set is also available with Volumes One, Two and Three, though Volume Four is only available as a single disk Volume. Unusually, the box set packages Volume Three in its own case with the Bulbasaur cover, leading to two near-identical Volume covers. Also unusually, an image on Play.com depicts a completely different cover for Volume Four, though this cover is used on the outer case of the box set.\n\nThe DVDs do not contain any subtitles, or special features besides episode and scene selection.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1896 and operated until 2009. The grounds of the prison are now included in part of the Barkley Marathons.\n\nBrushy Mountain State Penitentiary opened in 1896 in the aftermath of the Coal Creek War, an 1891 lockout of coal miners that took place in Coal Creek and Briceville, Tennessee, after miners protested the use of unpaid convict leasing in the mines. This labor conflict was eventually resolved in favor of the coal miners, with a bill passing the Tennessee state legislature to abolish the convict labor system, to be replaced by the Brushy Mountain Mine and Prison. The mountainous, secure site was located with the help of consulting geologists, and Brushy Mountain convicts built a railroad spur, worked the coal mines on site, operated coke ovens, or farmed. At the end of all the state's convict lease arrangements on January 1, 1896, some 210 of those prisoners became the first inmates of Brushy Mountain.\n\nThe original prison was a wooden structure also built by prisoner labor. It was replaced in the 1920s with a castle-like building constructed from stone mined by prisoners from a quarry on the property. As of 2008 Brushy Mountain was the oldest operating prison in Tennessee.\n\nThe prison is nearly encircled by rugged wooded terrain in a remote section of the Cumberland Plateau, adjacent to Frozen Head State Park and Natural Area. Escape attempts were infrequent and almost always unsuccessful. Perhaps the best-known escape attempt occurred on June 10, 1977, when James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr., escaped with six other inmates by climbing over a fence. Ray was captured less than 58 hours later in rugged mountain terrain 8 miles from the prison.\nThe prison was closed in 1972 after a strike by prison guards protesting unsafe working conditions. It reopened in 1976. Brushy Mountain was the only unionized prison in the state. The union worked closely with state legislators to improve the working conditions for correctional staff across the state. Under governor Lamar Alexander attempts were made to squeeze the union out of existence but his efforts were fruitless. Additional attempts over the years were attempted but they proved fruitless also. Many efforts to close the prison were attempted long before the 2009 closure. In 1998 Brushy Mountain Prison was administratively joined with Morgan County Correctional Complex. With the joining of the two institutions both prisons became unionized.\n\nIn the 1980s Brushy Mountain ended its long-standing function as a maximum security prison and assumed a mission as a classification facility. In its final operations, it had a capacity of 584 and was used as the state's reception/classification and diagnostic center for East Tennessee. It housed all custody levels of inmates, although it retained a maximum security designation due to the ninety six bed maximum security annex contained within the prison walls. These ninety six beds were used to house the state's most troublesome inmates. The last warden was Jim Worthington.\n\nThe prison closed June 11, 2009. Its functions were transferred to the Morgan County Correctional Complex. Morgan County officials hope to convert the facility to other uses, including a museum and a jail to serve Morgan and surrounding counties.\n\nBrushy was reopened to self-guided tours in 2018. The prison is open between April-December (the facility is too cold for tours in the winter months). Tours with guides made up of former guards and former inmates are also available. Along with tours of the facility, there is also an on-site restaurant (The \"Warden's Table\") and gift shop. There is a distillery on-site which distills and sells End of the Line Tennessee Moonshine and Frozen Head Vodka, the only spirits legally distilled at a prison. A museum on the prison property displays old record books, photos, news articles and prison artifacts such as homemade tattoo guns, weapons and other contraband articles. The museum also shows an 18-minute video three times an hour.\n\nThe grounds of the prison are also home to weddings, car shows, concerts, off-roading trails, and motorcycle gatherings. \n\nIn addition to James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King, Jr., notable inmates included Byron Looper, who was convicted in 2000 for the murder of State Senator Tommy Burks and began serving his life sentence at Brushy Mountain. George Hyatte, one of the perpetrators of the 2005 Kingston courthouse shooting, was imprisoned at Brushy Mountain at the time of that incident.\n\nA notable, albeit fictional, occasional inmate is Otis Lee Crenshaw, the trailer-dwelling country music singer created by comedian Rich Hall. \n\nAnother fictional inmate was Ray McDeere, the brother of protagonist Mitch McDeere, in the novel \"The Firm\".\n\nIn the novel \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Dr. Hannibal Lecter makes a deal in which he is to be transferred to the prison in exchange for information about the serial killer Buffalo Bill that would enable authorities to rescue his latest victim, Catherine Martin, the daughter of junior state senator Ruth Martin. His information was later proven false by Clarice Starling and he escapes before he arrives at the prison.\n\nIn the 1979 novel \"Suttree\" by Cormac McCarthy, the title character's friend, Gene Harrogate, is sentenced to a three-year prison term at Brushy Mountain after being caught burglarizing a store.\n\nIn singer John Hiatt's 1988 song \"Tennessee Plates\" the main character laments \"This ain't no hotel I'm writing you from/No, it's the Tennessee Prison up in Brushy Mountain...Yours sincerly's doin' 5-to-8/Just stampin' out my time making Tennessee plates.\"\n\nThe leading track of the 2014 album, \"Remedy\", by Old Crow Medicine Show is entitled \"Brushy Mountain Conjugal Trailer\". The album's cover is the state flag of Tennessee.\n\n"}
{"id": "1900053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900053", "title": "Kilcormac", "text": "Kilcormac\n\nKilcormac () is a small town in County Offaly, Ireland, located on the N52 at its junction with the R437 regional road, between the towns of Tullamore and Birr. It is a small town of 935 people (as of the 2016 census), many of whom were previously employed by Bord na Móna to work the local peat bogs. The town is located near the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The Silver River flows through the town. The town was more commonly referred to as \"Frankford\" prior to Irish independence.\nThe name Kilcormac comes from the Irish Cill Chormaic meaning Cormac's Church. This name is based on the local patron saint; Cormac Ua Liatháin, a native of Cork, who paid a visit to St Colmcille at the famous monastery he had founded in Durrow in 553 A.D. Cormac was so inspired by the great saint that he joined Colmcille and spent many years at Durrow, eventually taking over as abbot after Colmcille had gone to Iona in Scotland. He eventually founded a church near the Silver River which became known as Cill Chormaic. Over time the original church fell into ruin. Tradition holds that Cormac died in nearby Eglish following an attack by a pair of wolves. A window in Eglish Church depicts the event.\n\nHistorically, Kilcormac was part of the O'Molloy territory of Firceall which was part of the Kingdom of Meath, however Ballyboy was traditionally the main trading centre of the area at the time being situated on an important route which passed through the area. Following the Plantations of Offaly the area formed part of the Barony of Ballyboy. About five hundred years later reference is made to foreign monks, possibly Augustinian, at the Hermitage. A manuscript, written in Kilcormac in 1300, is now in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy. (The same museum also houses the crozier of Durrow, which was probably Cormac's symbol of authority when he succeeded Colmcille as abbot of Durrow).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Kilcormac was the site of a Carmelite monastery. Following the Henrican Reformation all monasteries were dissolved. The current Convent of Mercy is located on the site of the old monastery. The current Catholic Church is located on the site of Cormac's old church. The Church is a fine imposing building and dates from 1867 after a number of alterations to the original church built during the time of the penal laws. It is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nWithin the church is statue of the Pieta. According to tradition it was donated to the parish by a rich lady in the 16th century. It was placed in the parish church, which at that time was in Ballyboy, about 1 mile from Kilcormac. There it remained until 1650 when Oliver Cromwell’s army was reported approaching from the direction of Cadamstown. The pieta was eventually buried in a bog for 60 years for safety. During this time both Ballyboy and Kilcormac Churches were ruined by Cromwell's forces. While the church at Kilcormac was not rebuilt, Ballyboy Church was rebuilt eventually, but as part of the Established Anglican Church of Ireland. Tradition holds that only one man remained alive who knew where the Pieta was buried, and, according to tradition, he was carried on his deathbed to point it out. The carving was carefully recovered and when it was examined it was found to be in perfect condition. It was then placed in the Church Of The Nativity that had recently been built in Kilcormac.\n\nKilcormac grew in importance in the 18th and 19th Century as Ballyboy went into decline. Following the establishment of County Offaly and the growth of Tullamore, Kilcormac now found itself on the main route on from Birr to Tullamore and became an important market centre in the area. Following the relaxation of the Penal laws the Catholic Church also opted to build its church in Kilcormac and not Ballyboy which cemented its place as a market centre of the area given the Catholic majority population of the area.\n\nThe amenities serving the local population include a primary school, a secondary school (Coláiste Naomh Cormac), a number of local grocery shops, butchers, clothes shop, doctors practice, chemist and an agricultural/hardware store. There are also a number of pubs along the main street. Kilcormac has somewhat declined from its peak which was in the mid 20th Century. Many people traditionally found work in Bord na Móna and the bogs in what is now a declining industry. Bord na Móna remains an important part of the local economy with many employed in nearby Derrinlough at the peat briquette manufacturing plant. Agriculture and farming are also important to the local economy. The main route out of Kilcormac is the R437 regional road.\n\nLough Boora parklands is a local outdoor amenity for walkers and outdoor pursuits, as are the nearby Slieve Bloom Mountains.\n\nGaelic Games are the most popular sports played in the area and are played at all levels. Hurling is the most popular code of sport played. Kilcormac/Killoughey GAA is the local GAA club. The club has had a number of successes since its foundation in 1986, including winning the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship in 2012.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900073", "title": "Protection and indemnity insurance", "text": "Protection and indemnity insurance\n\nProtection and indemnity insurance, more commonly known as P&I insurance, is a form of mutual maritime insurance provided by a P&I club. Whereas a marine insurance company provides \"hull and machinery\" cover for shipowners, and cargo cover for cargo owners, a P&I club provides cover for open-ended risks that traditional insurers are reluctant to insure. Typical P&I cover includes: a carrier's third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during carriage; war risks; and risks of environmental damage such as oil spills and pollution. In the UK, both traditional underwriters and P&I clubs are subject to the Marine Insurance Act 1906.\n\nA P&I club is a mutual insurance association that provides risk pooling, information and representation for its members. Unlike a marine insurance company, which reports to its shareholders, a P&I club reports only to its members. Originally, P&I club members were typically shipowners, ship operators or demise charterers, but more recently freight forwarders and warehouse operators have been able to join.\n\nWhereas the assured pays a premium to an underwriter for cover which lasts for a particular time (say, a year, or a voyage), a P&I club member instead pays a \"call\". This is a sum of money that is put into the club's pool, a kind of \"kitty\". If, at the end of the year, there are still funds in the pool, each member will pay a reduced call the following year; but if the club has made a major payout (say, after an oil spillage) club members will immediately have to pay a further call to replenish the pool.\n\nThere is an International Group of P&I Clubs based at Peek House, London. These clubs cooperate to provide funds in the event of huge claims using a complex system to determine liability.\n\nThe ancient Greeks created the practice of General Average in Rhodos island, and ancient Romans could be said to have had a rudimentary form of marine insurance.\n\nHowever, a novel type of insurance that one would recognise as modern emerged in the London \"coffee shops\" in the 19th century. Shipowners and charterers would seek underwriters to insure their ships, and cargo owners (whether shippers, importers or consignees) would insure their cargoes. Carriers soon realised that often they might themselves be at fault should cargo be lost or damaged at sea, and they sought to take out third-party indemnity insurance in respect of cargo liability. Underwriters showed an unwillingness to take on such open-ended risks, so shipowners responded by forming their own mutual P&I clubs, acting as a shipowner's co-operative. An advantage was that a club worked for the shipowners, thereby eliminating the underwriters' profit margins and making P&I Insurance significantly cheaper.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the number of claims greatly increased due to the number of passengers emigrating to North America and Australia. Shipowners became aware of their insurers' compensation limits, especially when it came to damages caused by ship collisions. While the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1854 had determined that, when evaluating insurance claims, the value of ships should be no less than £15 per ton, many ships had an actual lower market value and existing insurance policies did not cover this gap in liability. The compensation for collision damages also excluded a quarter of such damages. Existing hull insurance policies included damages to the insured ship and liability for the damages it had caused, while the maximum amount shipowners could recover after collisions was the ship's insured value, injured crew members might seek compensation from their employers. Later, the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 made it easier for passengers or their survivors to file claims.\n\nPerhaps the first protection association, the Shipowners' Mutual Protection Society, was formed in 1855. It was intended to compensate for loss of life, injuries and collisions that were excluded from marine insurance policies beyond the monetary limit of these policies. Similar associations were later formed within the United Kingdom, in Scandinavia, Japan and the United States.\n\nIn 1874, the risk of liability for cargo carried by the insured ship was added to the insurance cover provided by a P&I club. Cargo value had risen and cargo underwriters, encouraged by UK courts, filed more claims to recover their losses from shipowners. These claims were not covered by the current marine insurance class. After 1874, many clubs added a marine indemnity class to respond to these new claims. This class was later merged with the marine insurance class reserved for the original protection risks and the distinction between the two classes virtually disappeared.\n\nAfter the Torrey Canyon grounding in 1967, covering the liabilities, costs and expenses of oil spills became an increasingly important aspect of P&I insurance.\n\nFollowing on from the innovations of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International Salvage Convention permitted salvage rewards to be made to salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for \"Special Compensation\", but the UK House of Lords case of the \"Nagasaki Spirit\" revealed that the convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere \"out-of-pocket expenses\", with no allowance for any profit margin. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&I clubs jointly developed the \"SCOPIC clause\", which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the statutory payment provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since.\n\nMarine insurers offer insurance on measurable risks: hull and machinery insurance for shipowners, and cargo insurance for cargo owners. P&I clubs provide insurance for broader, indeterminate risks that marine insurers usually do not cover, such as third party risks. These risks include: a carrier’s liability to a cargo-owner for damage to cargo, a shipowner’s liability after a collision, environmental pollution and P&I war risk insurance, or legal liability due to acts of war affecting the ship.\n\nMarine insurers are usually for-profit companies that charge customers a premium to fully cover ships and cargo in the time period when the policy applies. In contrast, a P&I club is run as a non-profit co-operative and the insurance is financed by “calls”. Club members contribute to the club’s common risk pool according to the Pooling Agreement's rules. If the risk pool cannot cover current claims, the club members will be asked to pay a further call. If the pool has a surplus, the club will ask for a lower call the following year or make a refund to members. Only shipowners with acceptable reputations are allowed to join a P&I club and any P&I club member who incurs reckless or avoidable losses to the club may be asked to leave.\n\nThus, marine cargo is generally covered twice by insurance standards. The shipper or cargo-owner will be covered by a marine insurer likely with 'all risks' cover. The carrier or shipowner will be covered by the P&I club but will typically limit their liability to goods owners to a small fraction of the retail value of goods. If the cargo is lost or damaged, the cargo-owner needs to first make a claim against the shipowner. However, the shipowner may avoid liability if it did not cause the loss or if the Hague-Visby Rules grant exemption from liability. In that case, the cargo-owner will claim against its own insurance company. If the cargo-owner fails to claim first against the shipowner, but claims instead against its own insurance company, the insurer, having reimbursed its client, will through subrogation pursue the claim in its own right against the shipowner.\n\nThe following are the major exceptions to P&I coverage:\n\n\nThe European Union Directive 2009/20/EC was implemented in all 27 Member States by January 1, 2012. The Directive requires compulsory P&I to cover for EU and foreign ships in EU waters and ports. Foreign vessels that do not comply to the Directive may be expelled or refused entry into any EU port, although ships may be allowed time to comply before expulsion. As EU competence does not generally extend to penology, (see \"Re Tachographs\" (CJEU) 1979), the Directive requires the Member States themselves to set penalties for any breach.\n\nThe Rotterdam Rules are a set of rules designed to replace the Hamburg Rules and the outdated Hague-Visby Rules (both of which are international conventions to impose duties upon a carrier of goods by sea). Should the Rotterdam Rules come into effect, they would cover not merely the sea voyage, but all parts of any contract of multimodal carriage with a sea leg. Thereafter, land carriers, warehouses, and freight forwarders would also need P&I cover. This would inevitably lead to an increase in the scope and importance of P&I cover, and might diminish the prevalence of standard cargo insurance.\n\nConventional P&I cover has been taken up primarily by shipowners and demise charterers, but a new development is P&I cover for time- and voyage-charterers. Since these charterers may have no long-term relationship with any vessel, and may well have periods when they are not chartering at all, the mutual model based on common-pool sharing of liability is not necessarily ideal. Some non-mutual \"charterers P&I clubs\" have arisen whereby a private company may act as broker to provide 3rd-party cover via underwriters, on payment of a conventional premium, rather than a P&I call. In addition to brokerage services, such a company may offer conventional \"our man on the spot\" P&I services.\n\nThe following is a list of P&I clubs around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Group of P&I Clubs (based at Peek House, London) comprises thirteen clubs, which provide P&I liability cover for approximately 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900077", "title": "UWF International", "text": "UWF International\n\nUnion of Wrestling Forces International, better known as UWF International, U-Inter, or simply UWFi, was a shoot style professional wrestling promotion in Japan from 1991 to 1996. Although the matches were worked (i.e. predetermined), the UWF-i was very convincing for its time, promoting a more hard-hitting, realistic style. In retrospect, UWFi, along with other shoot-style promotions, served as precursors to popular MMA promotions, particularly PRIDE.\n\nThe promotion was founded on May 10, 1991, as a continuation of the UWF. The UWF-i featured most of UWF's roster, and was led by Nobuhiko Takada, who was the top star and the face of the promotion. Other natives for the promotion included Kazuo Yamazaki, Yoji Anjo, Kiyoshi Tamura, Tatsuo Nakano, Yuko Miyato, Masahito Kakihara and kickboxer Makoto Oe. Vintage shooter Billy Robinson was used as a trainer for their gym (the UWFi Snakepit), and wrestling legend Danny Hodge occasionally served as a judge in their pursuit of old-school credibility. Lou Thesz would also be used as a trainer and spent a week every month in Japan teaching the wrestlers catch wrestling techniques. Former pro wrestler Shinji Sasazaki would lend a hand by helping some of the foreign talent, mostly from the Tennessee area, get booked on their cards.\n\nIn 1992, the UWFi introduced its first championship, the \"Real Pro-Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship\", which was won by Takada after a victory over top foreign antagonist Gary Albright. Lou Thesz acted as commissioner and lent his 1950s NWA World title belt to be used as the distinction for it. The theme of UWFi being \"real pro-wrestling\" was central to the promotion's image, and both Thesz and Takada would deride other Japanese promotions (particularly Takada's old promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling) for being \"fake\", while claiming themselves to be legit. UWF-i, however, was no more legit than any other group at the time. Takada went so far as to challenge the champions of other major Japanese promotions (Mitsuharu Misawa (AJPW Triple Crown Champion at the time), Masahiro Chono (NWA World Heavyweight Champion at the time), and The Great Muta (IWGP Heavyweight Champion at the time), in an effort to determine who was the true world champion.\n\nIn 1993, Super Vader, the World Heavyweight Champion from the United States-based World Championship Wrestling, accepted Thesz and Takada's grandstand challenge, whereas the aforementioned champions were \"too afraid\" of Takada to face him. After Gary Albright quit UWFi to join All Japan and Vader left over money disputes, the promotion was left with a lack of credible challengers to Takada's title, and interest in the promotion began to wane. After being overlooked several times over the years, Kazuo Yamazaki left to return to New Japan in July 1995.\n\nIn 1995, Anjo and other UWFi bookers proposed co-promoting with New Japan Pro Wrestling, as a potential solution to their financial problems. New Japan booker Riki Choshu agreed, under the condition that New Japan have full control over the booking of the interpromotional matches. Thesz, who saw New Japan as another gimmicky promotion, withdrew his support as a result and took the belt with him. For Choshu, it was an opportunity to get payback for Thesz and Takada's earlier derision of their wrestling style, and he was determined to show fans that the real stars were in New Japan. All of UWF-i's stars mainly lost the interpromotional matches, with the exception of Takada, who won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on January 4, 1996. Kiyoshi Tamura haf left UWFi before the feud in 1995, to join rival promotion, RINGS.\n\nIn 1996, as the New Japan feud died down, UWF-i formed an alliance with Genichiro Tenryu's WAR. The damage to the promotion's credibility had already been done, however, and UWFi had its farewell card (\"UWF FINAL\") on December 27, 1996 at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall arena. Most of the UWF-i roster formed Kingdom, which would promote a similar product on a smaller scale. Kingdom would have a presence at in 1997, as Yoji Anjo would lose to Tank Abbott, while Kazushi Sakuraba won the heavyweight tournament.\n\nThe combatants would start with 15 points each. Points would be lost for knockout attempts, being at a disadvantage during a hold, and/or for breaking a hold by grabbing onto the ring ropes with hand(s) and/or feet. The only way to win was by submission, knockout (count of 10) or a wrestler's points being reduced to 0.\n\nTag team matches were allowed as well, with 21 points (instead of 15) given to a team at start time. However, the points system was rarely referred to, as a wrestler or team losing points could still win by forcing his opponent to submit or by knocking him out. No pinfall counts were allowed, and no countouts were allowed (in practice, wrestlers never set foot outside the ring during the match).\n\nIn 1995 rules were somewhat relaxed to allow pinfalls in order to allow for New Japan, WAR, and other non-submission-oriented wrestlers (such as Abdullah the Butcher) to compete.\n\nNatives:\nForeigners:\n\nThe championship used the belt used by Lou Thesz as NWA World Champion during the 1950s.\nIn 1995, Hudson Soft published a video game, \"\" (最強～高田延彦～) for the Super Famicom in Japan. Unlike most wrestling games, \"Saikyō\" was a linear fighting game, but moves such as suplexes counted for heavy scoring, like in the real-life promotion. Nobuhiko Takada was the only actual wrestler licensed as a character, all others used made-up pseudonyms, such as Gary Albright being known as \"Briant\".\n\n\n"}

Tidal marshes experience many overlapping persistent cycles, including diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, day-night temperature fluctuations, spring-neap tides, seasonal vegetation growth and decay, upland runoff, decadal climate variations, and centennial to millennial trends in sea level and climate. They are also impacted by transient disturbances such as hurricanes, floods, storms, and upland fires.\n\nTidal marshes are differentiated into freshwater, brackish and salt according to the salinity of their water. Coastal marshes lie along coasts and estuarine marshes lie inland within the tidal zone. Location determines the controlling processes, age, disturbance regime, and future persistence of tidal marshes. Tidal freshwater marshes are further divided into deltaic and fringing types. Extensive research has been conducted on deltaic tidal freshwater marshes in Chesapeake Bay, which were formed as a result of historic deforestation and intensive agriculture.\n\nTidal marshes can be further categorized by salinity level, elevation, and sea level. Tidal marshes are commonly zoned into lower marshes (also called intertidal marshes) and upper or high marshes, based on their elevation above sea level. A middle marsh zone also exists for tidal freshwater marshes.\n\nTidal marshes may be further classified into back-barrier marshes, estuarine brackish marshes and tidal freshwater marshes, depending on the influence of sea level.\n\nCoastal tidal marshes are found within coastal watersheds and encompass a variety of types including fresh and salt marshes, bottomland hardwood swamps, mangrove swamps, and palustrine wetlands. \n\nTidal Marshes also form between a main shoreline and barrier islands. These elongated shifting landforms evolve parallel and in close proximity to the shoreline of a tidal marsh. Many become fully submerged at high tide, and become directly attached to the mainland when at low tide. Barrier island formation includes mechanisms such as offshore bar theory, spit accretion theory, and climate change. \n\nTidal marsh ecosystems provide numerous services, including supplying habitats to support a diverse range of biodiversity. Their areas are spawning grounds and home to \"feeder fish\" that lie low on the food chain, and serve as crucial rest-stops for migratory birds. Additionally, they provide suitable habitat to various tidal salt marsh specialist bird species, such as the seaside sparrow (\"Ammospiza maritima\") and the willet (\"Tringa semipalmata\") found in tidal marshes in Connecticut, U.S.\n\nOther ecosystem services include their role as significant carbon sinks and shoreline stabilizers. Tidal marshes provide flood protection to upland areas by storing ground water, and lessen the impact of storm surges on nearby shorelines. Tidal marshes located along coastlines also act as intricate filtration systems for watersheds. These areas absorb and trap pollutants from water run-off that travels from higher elevations to open water.\n\nHistorically, the global loss of tidal marshes can be attributed to the implementation of tidal restrictions and other draining activities. Tidal restrictions methods include diking, tide gates, and impoundments, which were implemented on coastal lands internationally in favour of creating agricultural land, as exemplified with large-scale diking that has occurred in Atlantic Canada and the U.S. (e.g. in The Bay of Fundy).\n\nCurrently, rising sea levels is one of the leading threats to tidal marshes caused by global warming and climate change. Pollution due to urbanization also continues to endanger tidal marsh ecosystems.\n\nRestoration of tidal marshes through the removal of tidal restrictions to re-establish degraded ecosystem services have been underway internationally for decades. Deliberate and natural restoration practices have occurred in the U.S., United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada. Research shows that tidal marsh restoration can be evaluated through various factors, such as vegetation, biogeochemical responses (e.g. salinity, sediment deposition, pH, and carbon sequestration), hydrologic responses, and wildlife community responses.\n\n\n"}

It was proposed in 1998 by Michael Fortescue, an expert in Eskimo–Aleut and Chukotko-Kamchatkan, in his book \"Language Relations across Bering Strait\". In 2011, Fortescue removed Chukotko-Kamchatkan from the proposal.\n\nStructural similarities between Uralic and Eskimo–Aleut languages were observed early. In 1746, the Danish theologian Marcus Wöldike compared Greenlandic to Hungarian. In 1818, Rasmus Rask considered Greenlandic to be related to the Uralic languages, Finnish in particular, and presented a list of lexical correspondences (Rask also considered Uralic and Altaic to be related to each other.) In 1959, Knut Bergsland published the paper \"The Eskimo–Uralic Hypothesis\", in which he, like other authors before him, presented a number of grammatical similarities and a small number of lexical correspondences. In 1962, Morris Swadesh proposed a relationship between the Eskimo–Aleut and Chukotko-Kamchatkan language families. In 1998, Michael Fortescue presented more detailed arguments in his book, \"Language Relations across Bering Strait\". His title evokes Morris Swadesh's 1962 article, \"Linguistic relations across the Bering Strait\".\n\nMichael Fortescue (2017) presents, besides new linguistic evidence, also several genetic studies, that support a common origin of the included groups, with a suggested homeland in Northeast Asia.\n\nFortescue (1998, pp. 60–95) surveys 44 typological markers and argues that a typological profile uniquely identifying the language families proposed to comprise the Uralo-Siberian family can be established. The Uralo-Siberian hypothesis is rooted in the assumption that this distinct typological profile was, rather than an areal profile common to four unrelated language families, the profile of a \"single\" language ancestral to all four: Proto-Uralo-Siberian.\n\n\n\n\nNone of the four families shows all of these 17 features; ranging from 12 reconstructible in Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan to 16 in Proto-Uralic. Frequently the modern-day descendant languages have diverged further from this profile — particularly Itelmen, for which Fortescue assumes substrate influence from a language typologically more alike to the non-Uralo-Siberian languages of the region.\n\nSeveral more widely spread typologically significant features may also instead represent contact influence, according to Fortescue (1998):\n\nApparently shared elements of Uralo-Siberian morphology include the following:\n\nProponents of the Nostratic hypothesis consider these apparent correspondences to be evidence in support of the proposed larger Nostratic family.\n\nFortescue (1998) lists 94 lexical correspondence sets with reflexes in at least three of the four language families, and even more shared by two of the language families. Examples are *ap(p)a 'grandfather', *kað'a 'mountain' and many others.\n\nBelow are some lexical items reconstructed to Proto-Uralo-Siberian, along with their reflexes in Proto-Uralic, Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan (sometimes Proto-Chukchi), and Proto-Eskimo–Aleut (sometimes Proto-Eskimo or Aleut). (Source: Fortescue 1998:152–158.)\n\nThese sound correspondences with Yukaghir and EA were suggested in Fortescue 1998:\n\nYukaghir and Uralic:\n\nFortescue argues that the Uralo-Siberian proto-language (or a complex of related proto-languages) may have been spoken by Mesolithic hunting and fishing people in south-central Siberia (roughly, from the upper Yenisei river to Lake Baikal) between 8000 and 6000 BC, and that the proto-languages of the derived families may have been carried northward out of this homeland in several successive waves down to about 4000 BC, leaving the Samoyedic branch of Uralic in occupation of the Urheimat thereafter.\n\nSome or all of the four Uralo-Siberian families have been included in more extensive groupings of languages (see links below). Fortescue's hypothesis does not oppose or exclude these various proposals. In particular, he considers that a remote relationship between Uralo-Siberian and Altaic (or some part of Altaic) is likely (see Ural–Altaic languages). However, Fortescue holds that Uralo-Siberian lies within the bounds of the provable, whereas Nostratic may be too remote a grouping to ever be convincingly demonstrated.\n\nThe University of Leiden linguist Frederik Kortlandt (2006:1) asserts that Indo-Uralic (a proposed language family consisting of Uralic and Indo-European) is itself a branch of Uralo-Siberian and that, furthermore, the Nivkh language also belongs to Uralo-Siberian. This would make Uralo-Siberian the proto-language of a much vaster language family. Kortlandt (2006:3) considers that Uralo-Siberian and Altaic (defined by him as consisting of Turkic, Mongolian, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese) may be coordinate branches of the Eurasiatic language family proposed by Joseph Greenberg but rejected by most linguists.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the beginning of the 20th century, pioneers such as Henri Coanda, Aurel Vlaicu, Traian Vuia and George Valentin Bibescu made important contributions to early aviation history, building revolutionary aeroplanes and contributing to the international scene.\n\nIn the present, the Romanian Civil Aeronautic Authority oversees all aviation activities.\n\nGeorge Valentin Bibescu was a Romanian aristocrat who became an early aviation pioneer and international figure. He flew a balloon named \"Romania\" brought from France 1905. Later he tried to teach himself how to fly a Voisin airplane, also brought from France, but without success. After Louis Blériot's demonstrative flights in Bucharest on October 18, 1909, Bibescu went to Paris and enrolled in Blériot's flying school where, in 1910, he obtained International Pilot License number 20. After returning from France, Bibescu organized the Cotroceni Piloting School in Bucharest where Mircea Zorileanu and Nicolae Capşa were licensed. On May 5, 1912, he founded the Romanian National Aeronautic League. Bibescu would later be instrumental in founding the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the international regulatory body for aeronautics. Between 1927 and 1930 he was its vice-president, and becoming president in 1930 and remaining so until 1941.\nTraian Vuia was a Romanian inventor and aviation pioneer. He constructed his first powered, fixed wing aircraft with wheeled undercarriage and in 1906 he flew short hops in it at Montesson near Paris, France. On March 18 he flew about 12 metres at a height of 1 foot, and on 19 August he flew for 24 metres. Although unsuccessful at true flight, Vuia's aircraft has been credited as \"the first man-carrying monoplane of basically modern configuration\" and influenced the more successful Brazilian pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont. Vuia went on to experiment with another monoplane and two helicopters but none was successful.\n\nAurel Vlaicu was born in Transylvania, then part of Austria-Hungary. Having constructed a glider with his brother, he moved to the Kingdom of Romania in 1909. His first aircraft, the \"Vlaicu I\", was constructed at the Army Arsenal at Bucharest and first flown on 17 June 1910, a day still celebrated in Romania as National Aviation Day. Vlaicu later constructed two more aircraft, fatally crashing the second in 1913 before the third had flown.\n\nHenri Coandă exhibited the Coanda-1910 at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris around October 1910, and built his first flying aircraft in 1911. Later he worked in the UK to design aircraft for World War I, a number of Bristol-Coandă and Coandă monoplanes being purchased by the Romanian Army and Government. Coandă continued to research in a variety of fields. He is most famous for discovering the Coanda effect in aerodynamics and fluidics.\n\nThe Romanian Army took an interest in aviation from the earliest days, facilitating the construction of the \"Vlaicu I\" in 1910. The next year the Army formed the Aviation Group, which over the next few years constructed Farman biplanes under license and also acquired two Blériot monoplanes, several Bristol-Coandă monoplanes and Two Morane Type F monoplanes. On 20 April 1913 it became the \"Corp al aernautlior permanenti\" – the Permanent Corps of Aeronauts. Three months later they engaged in reconnaissance sorties over the Bulgarian border at the start of the Second Balkan War.\n\nThe Romanian Air Corps was established on 15 September 1915, at a time during the First World War when Romania was still neutral. That same year, even before Romania joined the Western Powers in 1916, it was supplied with 44 aircraft by France. During the ensuing defeat of Romanian forces, the Air Corps was chronically short of serviceable aircraft and supplies and was reorganised several times.\n\nAfter the World War, the Air Corps again saw action in the 1919 campaign to secure Transylvania from Hungary. By then the Air Corps was in a sorry state, but following the collapse of the Hungarian communist regime the Air Corps gained 87 captured aircraft. From then on the air arm grew steadily, changing its name in 1920 to the \"Aeronautica Militara Romana\" (Romanian Military Aviation) and in the 1930s to the \"Fortele Aeriene Regale ale Romaniei\" (Royal Air Forces of Romania, or FARR). Further aircraft were acquired from France and licensed production was set up at various centres. By the early 1930s Romanian aviation had advanced enough to produce its own designs and types such as the SET 10 fighter-trainer, IAR 15 and IAR 16 began to appear. However these were not yet judged adequate and for a period front line fighter squadrons were equipped with Polish PZL fighters, examples of which were both purchased and manufactured. In the late 1930s the FARR also significantly developed its bombing capabilities and the IAR 37 light reconnaissance bomber went into production.\n\nAs World War II loomed in 1939, Romania found itself in a precarious position and made many treaties with its neighbours. One result of this was a change of supplier; a number of German aircraft were procured and IAR licensed production of the Junkers Jumo 211Da aero engine. In response Britain began supplying frontline aircraft, although only a few Hawker Hurricanes arrived in the few days left before hostilities would begin.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of war and the German invasion of Poland, over 100 surviving aircraft of the Polish Air Force joined the FARR. However the increasing aggressiveness of the Axis powers Germany and Russia forced Romania to join them. Through 1940 and '41 the German presence and influence grew strongly.\n\nIn June 1941, with the FARR operational strength at 504 aircraft, Romania joined Germany in the attack on the Soviet Union and the FARR was committed heavily in support. In March 1942 deliveries of the IAR 80 fighter began, and both this type and its derivative the IAR 81 joined front line operations. Following a long and bloody campaign, by the summer of 1943 emphasis was beginning to switch to the air defence of Romania and especially the oil wells and refineries which supplied Germany, the FARR giving a good account of itself during the American Operation Tidal Wave bombing raids. By now the FARR was operating a great mix of aircraft types, including more than 80 types of trainer.\n\nOn 20 August 1944 the Soviets invaded Romania. Following a brief period of confusion, Romania changed sides and, once more allied with the Soviet Union, turned against its German occupiers. Although by now possessing less than 200 operational aircraft, the FARR joined in the attack on German forces. Despite chaotic conditions, exacerbated by the Soviet demand for Romanian mechanics to maintain their aircraft, IAR continued a low level of manufacture and the FARR began to rebuild its strength. But then in 1945 operations over Slovakia and against German and Hungarian forces reduced its strength once again, having just 10 operational combat squadrons remaining by the end of the war.\n\nIn 1947 Romania became a republic and its air arm changed its name to the \"Fortele Aeriene ale Republicii Populare Romania\", the Air Forces of the Romanian People's Republic or FR-RPR. From 1948 greater cooperation with Soviet forces began with the introduction of the Yakovlev Yak-11 trainer, and the ageing combat fleet progressively supplemented and replaced by more modern Soviet types.\n\nThe first jet fighter arrived in the 1950s, in the form of the Yakovlev Yak-23. A process of expansion and modernization continued, and accelerated after Romania joined the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The supersonic age arrived during this period, with the introduction of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19. The expansion stopped after the withdrawal of the last Soviet forces in 1964, and the FR-RPR ended its participation in Warsaw Pact exercises. 1965 saw the introduction not only of the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighter but also the Czech Aero L-29 Delfin jet trainer.\n\n1966 saw yet another name change accompanying Romania's establishment of a Socialist Republic, to the \"Fortele Aeriene ale Republicii Socialiste Romania\" – the Air Forces of the Romanian Socialist Republic or FR-RSR. The new FR-RSR went on to maintain and modernize its fleet, including the introduction of a variety of Mil helicopters, some of them Polish-built.\n\nIn the 1970s Romania began once more to develop its own military aircraft including a joint Yugoslav-Romanian attack aircraft built in Romania as the IAR-93 Vultur, and the IAR-99 Şoim trainer – the first jet of wholly Romanian design. Helicopters such as the IAR 316 and IAR 330 were built under license from Aérospatiale, and the ROMBAC 1-11 passenger aircraft under license from BAC.\n\nDumitru Prunariu is the only Romanian astronaut who participated in a space mission (Soyuz 40 – May 14, 1981).\n\nRegional Air Services – Tuzla www.regional-air.ro \n\nFormer Romanian carriers:\n\n\nRomania has a well-developed airport infrastructure compared to other countries in Eastern Europe, but still underdeveloped compared to Western countries standards. There are 16 commercial airports in service today, most of them opened for international traffic. Four of the airports (OTP, BBU, TSR, CND) have runways of in length and are capable of handling jumbo jets. Six of the airports (BCM, CRA, IAS, SBZ, SCV, SUJ) have runways of in length, while the rest of them have runways of in length.\n\nIn 2011, the air traffic reached 10.7 million passengers, 5.1% more than the previous year when there were 10.2 million people flying by plane.\n\nThe industrial facilities for aircraft building and maintenance are located in Bacǎu (Aerostar), Braşov (Industria Aeronautică Română), Craiova (Avioane Craiova) and Bucharest (Romaero, Turbomecanica).\n\nFollowing the ascending curve of the economy growth, the air transportation in Romania experiences a favorable trend. Carpatair is the Romanian airline with the most spectacular growth; the national carrier TAROM is recovering from a difficult period at the beginning of the 2000s, 2004 being the first profitable year in the last 10 years, but with a price: the cancellation of the long-haul flights to New York, Chicago, Montreal and Beijing. In 2006 the company started a fleet update program with the acquisition of 4 new Airbus A318 airplanes, 2 new ATR 72 turboprops in 2009 and two new Boeing 737-800 NG in 2017. The first Romanian low-cost airline, Blue Air, is going through a development phase, while other low-cost airlines are ready to start their operations.\n\nThere are many investment projects also in airport infrastructure: the upgrading of the existing airports (major rehabilitation programs for OTP, TSR, CLJ, CND, the airports with the most significant traffic growth) and the construction of three new airports in Braşov, Galaţi – Brăila (a 600,000 inhabitants urban area without airport access) and Deva – Alba Iulia (Southern Transylvania).\n\nCurrently (dec. 2006) the most advanced project is the construction of the new Braşov Airport , the construction site opening was planned for March 2007 but construction was halted. Construction restarted in April 2013. The project consists of a 1 mil. passengers/year terminal and a runway of 2,800 m long.\n\nNational Aviation Day is celebrated on 17 June, the anniversary of Aurel Vlaicu's first flight.\n\nEarly pioneer aircraft have appeared on postage stamps, and Vlaicu on a bank note.\n\n\n"}

It is a private high school with a middle school subdivision, serving students in grades 6 through 12. The school occupies a sprawling campus near the geographic center of Irondequoit, just 1 mile from Lake Ontario, and 10 minutes away from downtown Rochester.\n\nBishop Kearney High School was co-founded by Blessed Edmund Rice and the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland, with the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The school was named after Bishop James E. Kearney of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester. It opened in 1962, accepting only freshmen at the time. Those freshmen remained the school's upperclassmen throughout their tenure, so they became the first graduates in 1966. It was opened at the same time as a nearly identical sister school, Cardinal Mooney High School, which closed in 1989. Bishop Kearney's first principal was the late Joseph M. Clark, FSCH, of the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland.\n\nOn February 13, 2007, the school announced that local billionaire B. Thomas Golisano would be donating a substantial amount to the school for improvements in technology. The money will allow the school to provide every student with a laptop computer, as well as fund a wireless network, digital projection systems, video conferencing systems, and interactive whiteboards, with the stated goal of making the school \"the most technologically advanced high school\" in the country. The school will also be making curriculum enhancements with its College Prep Plus, to \"better prepare students for the working world,\" including work-scholarship opportunities with local colleges and businesses. The donation has prompted the school to announce a pending name change, to \"Bishop Kearney High School / A Golisano Education Partner.\"\n\nOn February 19, 2014 Tom Golisano offered to rescue the school's building from a bankruptcy filing by the founding Christian Brothers. Golisano offered $3.4 million to buy the 200,000-square-foot building and the 42 acres of surrounding property, with the stated intention of maintaining the school's existing educational mission.\n\nFrom 2015-2016, the school renovated the former dormatory space of the Irish Christian Brothers, on the third floor of the north half of the building. This was converted into residence space for an elite girls hockey program — with 21 dorms accommodating 42 players. The players room at and attend classes at Bishop Kearney, and participate in the hockey program — run through LEGACY Global Hockey — titled \"Selects Academy at Bishop Kearney\". The program launched in August 2016 with a 16-and-under team (U-16) team — followed by a U-19 team in 2017 — each with about 20 girls. The program recruits players from across the United States and Canada, and play their season from September to March, and competes against teams nationally (not through Section V Athletics).\n\n\nBishop Kearney is well-known for its strong athletics programs in Section V, and the new Selects Girls Hockey program.\n\nBK has won Section V championship tournaments 59 times over school history. Recent Championships include: Football [Class D] (2015), Football [C] (2016), Girls Volleyball [C] (2016), Softball [C] (2017), Boys Soccer [C-2] (2017), Girls Basketball [AA] (2018).\n\nBishop Kearney has claimed New York State titles four times:\n\n\nAthletics Facilities:\n\nBrother Clark Stadium is an athletics field at the school.

During a trip with his uncle to visit his uncle's friend Dr. Pipt, Ojo learns from Pipt's wife, Dame Margolotte, that he is known to others as \"Ojo the Unlucky.\" Ojo discovers rationalizations for this, including the fact that he was born on Friday the 13th, is left-handed, and has a wart under his arm, and he begins to believe that bad luck follows him wherever he goes. However, the Tin Woodman officially deems him Ojo the Lucky after hearing these reasons because he believes Ojo's bad luck is due to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nOjo later starred in his own book, \"Ojo in Oz\" by Ruth Plumly Thompson. In this book, Thompson picked up a dropped thread of Baum's about Ojo being possibly related to royalty and made him the Prince of Seebania, whose family was enchanted by an evil sorcerer named Mooj, causing his father, King Ree Alla Bad, to run around Oz as a bandit called Realbad.\n\nAlthough Ojo is a Munchkin, he seems to be taller than the Munchkins Dorothy met during her first trip to Oz, though this is never stated.

{"id": "1900195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900195", "title": "Finings", "text": "Finings\n\nFinings are substances that are usually added at or near the completion of the processing of brewing wine, beer, and various nonalcoholic juice beverages. They are used to remove organic compounds, either to improve clarity or adjust flavor or aroma. The removed compounds may be sulfides, proteins, polyphenols, benzenoids, or copper ions. Unless they form a stable sediment in the final container, the spent finings are usually discarded from the beverage along with the target compounds that they capture.\n\nSubstances used as finings include egg whites, blood, milk, isinglass, and Irish moss. These are still used by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and are more widely used, including bentonite, gelatin, casein, carrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolyase, PVPP, kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen, hydrated yeast, and activated carbon.\n\nTheir actions may be broadly categorized as either electrostatic, adsorbent, ionic, or enzymatic.\n\nThe electrostatic types comprise the vast majority; including all but activated carbon, fining yeast, PVPP, copper sulfate, pectinase and pectolase. Their purpose is to selectively remove proteins, tannins (polyphenolics) and coloring particles (melanoidins). They must be used as a batch technique, as opposed to flow-through processing methods such as filters. Their particles each have an electric charge which is attracted to the oppositely charged particles of the colloidal dispersion that they are breaking. The result is that the two substances become bound as a stable complex; their net charge becoming neutral. Thus the agglomeration of a semi-solid follows, which may be separated from the beverage either as a floating or settled mass.\n\nThe only adsorbent types of finings in use are activated carbon and specialized fining yeasts. Although activated carbon may be implemented as a flow-through filter, it is also commonly utilized as a batch ingredient, which later must be separated and discarded from the beverage. It can completely/partially remove benzenoid compounds and all classes of polyphenols non-specifically, decolorizing and deodorizing juices and wines. Traditionally, yeast fining has involved the addition of hydrated yeasts used as adsorption agents. Consisting of approximately 30% protein, yeast cell walls have a chemical affinity with wine compounds, such as those that may be polyphenolic or metallic. Indeed, yeast fining is a practical means of removing excess copper ions (greater than 0.5 mg/L) when copper sulfate is used to bind selected volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).\n\nThe ionic finings are copper sulfate and PVPP. When dissolved in aqueous beverages, copper sulfate's copper ions can chemically bind undesirable sulfides. The resulting complexes must be removed by other finings. The action of PVPP appears to be through the formation of hydrogen bonds between its carbonyl groups and the phenolic hydrogens of the polyphenols. It attracts the low molecular weight polyphenols rather than the condensed tannins and leucanthocyanins that are removed by gelatin.\n\nThe enzymatic finings are pectin and pectinase. They aid in destroying the large polysaccharide molecule named pectin, which otherwise causes haze in fruit wines and juices.

Located near Eythorne , Elvington was mostly built in the early 20th century to serve the nearby coal mine at Tilmanstone, as were other Kent Coalfield villages including Snowdown, Aylesham and Betteshanger.\n\nThe name Elvington derives from the Old English meaning \"farmstead of someone named Ælfwine\"; a manor or farm of that name reportedly once stood at what is now the bowling club.\n\nApparently the Romans once marched through this area of Kent using the Ashey path to Barfrestone and the Roman Path across the downs and along what is now Roman Way, hence the name.\n\nIn 1916 the East Kent Light Railway opened a station at Elvington called Elvington Halt. This served passengers until 1948, and closed entirely in 1951.\n\nToday the site of the mine is an industrial estate between Tilmanstone and Eythorne located on the Pike Road. A new housing estate was built in the mid-1990s and has been extensively added to.\n\nThe village is also on the Miner's Way Trail. Using the Roman Way to head to Shepherdswell. The trail links up the coalfield parishes of East Kent.\n\nServices today include a community/learning centre, school, shop, hairdressers, and takeaway shop as well as local information centre providing access to training and employment for local residents. The post office closed in 2008. Eythorne Elvington Community Primary school serves 104 pupils from school years one to six from Elvington and Eythorne.\n\nRecent investment from agencies such as the South East England Development Agency has led to the development of the former miners hall into a communication and learning centre.\n"}

{"id": "1900228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900228", "title": "Nemaline myopathy", "text": "Nemaline myopathy\n\nNemaline myopathy (also called rod myopathy or nemaline rod myopathy) is a congenital, hereditary neuromuscular disorder with many symptoms that can occur such as muscle weakness, hypoventilation, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired speech ability. The severity of these symptoms varies and can change throughout one's life to some extent. The prevalence is estimated at 1 in 50,000 live births. It is the most common non-dystrophic myopathy.\n\n\"Myopathy\" means muscle disease. Muscle fibers from a person with nemaline myopathy contains thread-like rods, sometimes called nemaline bodies. While the rods are diagnostic of the disorder, they are more likely a byproduct of the disease process rather than causing any dysfunction on their own. People with nemaline myopathy (NM) usually experience delayed motor development, or no motor development in severe cases, and weakness may occur in all of the skeletal muscles, such as muscles in the arms, legs, torso, neck flexors, throat, and face. The weakness tends to be more severe in the proximal muscles rather than the distal muscles. The ocular muscles are normally spared.\n\nThe disorder is often clinically categorized into groups with wide ranges of overlapping severity, from the most severe neonatal form which is incompatible with life, to a form so mild that it may not be diagnosed since the person appears to function at the lowest end of normal strength and breathing adequacy. Sporadic late onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) is not a congenital disorder and is considered a different muscle disease from NM, which has its onset at birth or early childhood. Respiratory problems are usually a primary concern for people with all forms of NM, and respiratory infections are quite common. NM shortens life expectancy, particularly in the more severe forms, but aggressive and proactive care allows most individuals to survive and even lead active lives.\n\nNemaline myopathy is one of the neuromuscular diseases covered by the Muscular Dystrophy Association in the United States.\n\nSigns vary from person to person. Young children and babies lack movement and have a difficult time eating and breathing. For young children not diagnosed immediately at birth, these are usually the first visible symptoms. One sign is a swollen face in disproportional areas. Other examples in newborns include swaying and a difficulty in moving. Other symptoms include feeble muscles in the neck and upper rib cage area. In adults, the most common symptom is respiratory problems. Other symptoms in adults could range from mild to severe speech impediments. It is common to be diagnosed with scoliosis in relations to nemaline myopathy.\nAs babies that have NM develop and become of age when they should start walking, many take longer than average due to the lack of muscle, or just muscle fatigue.\n\nSince facial muscles are involved in NM takeover, elongated faces and a lower mandible are often observed in people with NM. People affected by NM usually will begin to feel muscle exhaustion between ages 20–50. Because NM only becomes worse, even with treatment, people who show early signs of NM only become weaker faster as opposed to a teenager who is just now showing symptoms, for example. Gastroesophageal reflux, although not common, is associated with NM. Heart abnormalities can occur as a result of NM, but the likelihood of that happening are not high.\n\nMost children with mild NM eventually walk independently, although often at a later age than their peers. Some use wheelchairs or other devices, such as walkers or braces, to enhance their mobility. Individuals with severe NM generally have limited limb movement and use wheelchairs full-time.\n\nBecause of weakness in the trunk muscles, people with NM are prone to scoliosis, which usually develops in childhood and worsens during puberty. Many individuals with NM undergo spinal fusion surgery to straighten and stabilize their backs. Osteoporosis is also common in NM.\n\nAlthough patients early on often have mobility in their joints that is past the normal range, as they age, joint deformities and scoliosis usually occur. If the person with nemaline myopathy keeps an eye on his or her joints early on, the problems with them can be detected when they begin and their progression can be delayed. Treatment of joint problems ranges from stretching exercises with physical therapy to surgical introduction of braces. The benefits of exercise in people with nemaline myopathy are still being studied, however, researchers have seen improvements in muscle function from low-intensity exercise. Vigorous exercise and the use of heavy weights should be avoided.\n\nAttention to respiratory issues is critical to the health of all people with NM. Infants with severe NM frequently experience respiratory distress at or soon after birth. Many are ventilated via tracheostomy, and with proper breathing assistance they may attain good health. Though respiratory compromise may not be immediately apparent in people with intermediate or mild NM, it nearly always exists to some extent. As in many neuromuscular disorders, hypoventilation can begin insidiously, and it may cause serious health problems if not remedied by the use of noninvasive mechanical devices to assist breathing, particularly at night.\n\nBulbar (throat) muscle weakness is a main feature of nemaline myopathy. Most individuals with severe NM are unable to swallow and receive their nutrition through feeding tubes. Most people with intermediate and mild NM take some or all of their nutrition orally. Bulbar muscle impairment may also lead to difficulty with communication. People with NM often have hypernasal speech as a result of poor closure of the velopharyngeal port (between the soft palate and the back of the throat). Communicative skills may be enhanced through speech therapy, oral prosthetic devices, surgery, and augmentative communication devices. Individuals with NM are usually highly sociable and intelligent, with a great desire to communicate.\n\nPhysical expression of nemaline myopathy varies greatly, but weakness is usually concentrated in the proximal muscles, particularly respiratory, bulbar and trunk muscles. People with severe NM show obvious symptoms at birth, while those with intermediate or mild NM may initially appear unaffected. Babies with NM are frequently observed to be \"floppy\" and hypotonic. Children born with NM often gain strength as they grow, though the effect of muscle weakness on body features may become more evident with time. Adults with NM typically have a very slender physique.\n\nNemaline myopathy is caused by mutations in one of at least 11 different genes. Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder and both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms can occur. Diagnosis is made based upon clinical signs such as muscle weakness, absent or low deep tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia), and a high-arched palate, along with electron-dense aggregates, called nemaline rods, being observed at the microscopic level within muscle fibers. Genetic confirmation through identification of a known genetic mutation in the patient is also an important component of diagnosis.\n\nThe two most common gene mutations causing nemaline myopathy are found on \"NEB\" or \"ACTA1\". Mutations of the NEB gene usually result in symptoms present at birth or beginning in early childhood. This mutation results in about 50% of affected nemaline myopathy patients. The most common inheritance pathway for those with mutations in \"NEB\" is autosomal recessive in which each parent carries one mutated copy along with one normal functioning copy of the gene, and they pass the mutated copy to their offspring. In some cases, occasionally with \"ACTA1\" mutations, NM can be caused by an inheritance pattern of autosomal dominance. This mutation results in about 15 to 25 percent of the NM cases. One reason why this is lower is because mutations resulting in the \"ACTA1\" gene would usually not be passed down from parents, and thus this type of mutation must happen spontaneously in the egg or sperm. When the condition is heritable, each pregnancy with the same partners has the same risk of passing the mutated genes to offspring. New mutations (de novo) can also occur causing NM and de novo mutations have been most often found to occur in the \"ACTA1\" gene.\nMYPN is the last found gene related to NM The risk of all cases of nemaline myopathy is the same in males and females.\n\nThe physical capabilities of a given person with NM do not correlate well either with genotype or with muscle pathology as observed in the biopsy.\n\nMuscle cells contract in complex mechanical and chemical processes. If any part of the process or structure is disrupted, dysfunction will likely result, as in the case of those with genetic variations. In those with nemaline myopathy, muscle contraction is adversely affected. At the electron microscopic level, rod-shaped components can often be seen in some of the muscle cells, and when seen, are diagnostic for the condition called nemaline rod myopathy. The presence of these rods is not itself causing muscle weakness; rather they appear as a result of something going wrong within the muscle fiber. There is no connection between the number of rods found in the muscle cells and the amount of weakness a person has. All of the different gene mutations leading to the condition called nemaline myopathy that have been found so far are in genes that encode different components of the sarcomere. In normal muscle cells, the various parts of the muscle fibers that make up the sarcomere are distributed evenly in a pattern for effective muscle contraction. Evidence suggests that some kinds of NM affect the arrangement of these muscle fibers, causing the muscles to be unable to contract as efficiently or effectively.\nNemaline myopathy is usually genetic and shows traits in the affected individual from birth or an early age. However, there are some cases of symptoms of nemaline myopathy not showing up until adulthood. These cases are usually not genetic. Of the genes that have been linked to nemaline myopathy, most are also involved in encoding proteins in the sarcomeres in the muscle cells. Respiratory muscles are often more affected than other skeletal muscle groups. Cardiac muscle is usually not affected in nemaline myopathy; however, in cases where it does, patients often present with dilated cardiomyopathy. The ocular muscles are usually spared.\n\nThe different genes whose mutations lead to the different kinds of nemaline myopathies affect the cells and the person's body differently. The first kind of nemaline myopathy identified is due to the Slow α-Tropomyosin Gene TPM3 and varies from case to case with its severity. In this kind of nemaline myopathy, affected people are weaker and more affected in their lower limbs than their upper limbs. \nAs stated above, the most common genetic form of NM is caused by a mutation in the nebulin gene, called Nebulin, and has a range of severity levels. All published cases up to this point where NM is thought to be caused by a mutation in the \"NEB\" gene have been autosomal recessive and are the most common cause of nemaline myopathy. Patients with this kind of NM are more affected in the muscles in their head, rather than their proximal muscles at the core of their body. Consequently, patients with this genetic mutation often cannot lift their heads and speak with a nasal voice. There have been cases that suggest this kind of NM may lead to patients having higher intellect.\n\nA third kind of nemaline myopathy in the Skeletal Muscle α-Actin Gene ACTA1 is due to a recessive null mutation. These patients do not always show the typical nemaline bodies in their muscle cells. The only abnormality they show is an abnormal distribution of muscle fibers.\n\nThere are several other identified kinds of mutations that lead to Nemaline Myopathies. One affects slow skeletal muscles, one leads to the formation of both nemaline bodies and other abnormal, core-like, structures forming in the patient's muscles.\n\n\nAt present, Nemaline myopathy does not have a cure. Nemaline myopathy is a very rare disease that only affects 1 out of 50,000 on average, although recent studies show that this number is even smaller. There are a number of treatments to minimize the symptoms of the disease. The treatments and procedures to help patients with nemaline myopathy vary depending on the severity of the disease. A possible accommodation could be the use of a stabilizer, such as a brace. Other means include moderate stretching and moderate exercise to help target muscles maintain maximum health.\nAs people with NM grow and develop throughout their lives, it is important for them to see a variety of health professionals regularly, including a neurologist, physical therapist, and others, such as speech therapists and psychologists, to help both the patient and family adjust to everyday life.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for NM, it is possible, and common for many people live healthy active lives even with moderate to severe cases.<ref name=\"Diseases-Inherited/Endocrine Myopathies\"></ref> Research continues to seek ways to ameliorate debilitating symptoms and lengthen the life-span in quality ways for those affected. Some people have seen mild improvements in secretion handling, energy level, and physical functioning with supplemental L-tyrosine, an amino acid that is available through health centers. Some symptoms may worsen as the patient ages. Muscle loss increases with age naturally, but it is even more significant with nemaline myopathy.\n\nNew research resources have become available for the NM community, such as the CMDIR (registry) and the CMD-TR (biorepository). These two resources connect families and individuals interested in participating in research with the scientists that aim to treat or cure NM. Some research on NM seeks to better understand the molecular effects the gene mutations have on muscle cells and the rest of the body and to observe any connections NM may have to other diseases and health complications.\n\n\"Rod myopathy\" was first identified by Douglas Reye, an Australian physician, in 1958. However, Reye's results were never published because another doctor dismissed his finding of rods in the muscle tissue as an artifact of the biopsy. Forty years later, Reye's \"rod myopathy\" patient was confirmed to have nemaline myopathy. Another group of Australian researchers has since published an article recognizing Reye for his work.\n\n\"Nemaline myopathy\" was first named in a published paper in 1963 by North American researchers P.E. Cohen and G. M. Shy. Shy and his team discovered rod- like structures in muscle fibers of patients with muscle weakness by performing muscle biopsies on multiple patients. Laboratories performing research on NM are located around the world, notably in the United States, Canada, England, Finland, and Australia.\n\nThe NM community has a number of resources to welcome affected individuals and their families, such as the Nemaline Myopathy Welcome Flyer. In 1999, the first website on nemaline myopathy was launched, and in October 2004, the first Nemaline Myopathy Convention was held in Toronto, Canada. Many more conferences and social events have been held since, and all events organized since 2008 have been co-sponsored by A Foundation Building Strength for Nemaline Myopathy (AFBS), the only foundation focused on supporting treatment development and social events for the NM community. In March 2006, Niki Shisler released a book, \"Fragile\", in which she recounted her experiences surrounding the birth of twin sons with severe NM. In 2014, a team of experts collaborated with affected individuals and families caring for someone with a congenital myopathy to develop the first guidebook on managing life with a congenital myopathy, like NM, found here The Care of Congenital Myopathy: A Guide for Families.\n\n"}

He served from 1986 to 2001 as the first president of the International Bluegrass Music Association. Wernick is also an outspoken atheist and humanist, and at one time led a secular humanist \"congregation\" in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nPete Wernick was born in New York City and began playing the banjo at the age of fourteen. He pursued studies at Columbia University, hosting New York City's only bluegrass radio program in the 1960s on WKCR-FM and earning a Ph.D. in sociology, thus the moniker \"Dr. Banjo\". In 1970 while working at Cornell University, he formed Country Cooking in Ithaca, New York together with Tony Trischka, Russ Barenberg, John Miller, and Nondi Leonard. They recorded four albums for Rounder Records, adding the talents of Kenny Kosek, Harry Gilmore (later known as Lou Martin), and Andy Statman, among others.\n\nIn 1976, Wernick and his wife Nondi Leonard (now known as Joan Wernick), settled in Niwot, Colorado and with Tim O'Brien began to develop \"Niwot Music\", consisting only of banjo, mandolin and bass. The music was showcased on his 1977 solo album \"Dr. Banjo Steps Out\". In January 1978, with O'Brien, Charles Sawtelle, and Mike Scap, he started the bluegrass band Hot Rize. Nick Forster replaced Scap in May, 1978, completing the band's classic lineup that recorded and performed nationally and internationally full-time for 12 years, through April, 1990.

After disbanding as a full-time unit, the group continued with several performances a year until 1998, the year before Sawtelle's death. Currently leading the bluegrass/jazz combo Flexigrass, and a sometime member of the Colorado bluegrass band Long Road Home, he also performs with his wife Joan (\"Dr. and Nurse Banjo\") and with Hot Rize for limited tours and music festivals.\n\nIn 1986 the Board of the newly formed IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) elected Wernick its first president, a position he held until 2001.\n\nWernick was one of the members of the short-lived bluegrass supergroup Men with Banjos who Know How to Use Them, a group that included Steve Martin and Earl Scruggs among its other members.\n\nIn 2010, the Wernicks became the first Americans to tour in Russia as a bluegrass act, performing at the first annual Russian bluegrass festival in Vologda and Semenkovo, and in St. Petersburg. The duet has also performed in recent years in Ireland, England, Denmark, Israel, the Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland, and Holland.\n\nWernick is a prominent teacher of bluegrass, having hosted over 200 music camps since 1980 and still conducting several each year. After starting as banjo camps, since 1999 the camps have focused mostly on bluegrass jamming for all bluegrass instruments. Wernick has produced 10 instructional videos for Homespun and his books \"Bluegrass Banjo\" and \"Bluegrass Songbook\" have together sold over a third of a million copies. He also co-authored in 1987 with Tony Trischka, the encyclopedic \"Masters of the Five String Banjo\". Since 1999 his website, DrBanjo.com has presented many instruction articles and an Ask Dr. Banjo section. \n\nIn 2010 Wernick created The Wernick Method, a national network of bluegrass teachers he certifies to teach bluegrass jamming. As of 2020, Wernick Method teachers have conducted 900 classes in 46 states and 11 countries, registering over 10,000 students.\n\nWernick is also a survivor of the United Airlines Flight 232 air disaster. He composed a song inspired by that incident, called \"A Day In '89 (You Never Know)\", however has not released a recording of it yet.\n\n"}
{"id": "1900262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900262", "title": "Mann Gulch fire", "text": "Mann Gulch fire\n\nThe Mann Gulch fire was a wildfire reported on August 5, 1949, in a gulch located along the upper Missouri River in the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness (then known as the Gates of the Mountains Wild Area), Helena National Forest, in the U.S. state of Montana. A team of 15 smokejumpers parachuted into the area on the afternoon of August 5, 1949, to fight the fire, rendezvousing with a former smokejumper who was employed as a fire guard at the nearby campground. As the team approached the fire to begin fighting it, unexpected high winds caused the fire to suddenly expand, cutting off the men's route and forcing them back uphill. During the next few minutes, a \"blow-up\" of the fire covered in ten minutes, claiming the lives of 13 firefighters, including 12 of the smokejumpers. Only three of the smokejumpers survived. The fire would continue for five more days before being controlled.\n\nThe United States Forest Service drew lessons from the tragedy of the Mann Gulch fire by designing new training techniques and safety measures that developed how the agency approached wildfire suppression. The agency also increased emphasis on fire research and the science of fire behavior.\n\nUniversity of Chicago English professor and author Norman Maclean (1902–1990) researched the fire and its behavior for his book, \"Young Men and Fire\" (1992) which was published after his death. Maclean, who worked northwestern Montana in logging camps and for the forest service in his youth, recounted the events of the fire and ensuing tragedy and undertook a detailed investigation of the fire's causes. \"Young Men and Fire\" won the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction in 1992. The 1952 film \"Red Skies of Montana\", starring actor Richard Widmark and directed by Joseph M. Newman, was loosely based on the events of the Mann Gulch fire.\n\nThe location of the Mann Gulch fire was included as a historical district on the United States National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1999.\n\nThe fire started when lightning struck the south side of Mann Gulch at the Gates of the Mountains, a canyon over five miles long that cuts through a series of 1,200 foot cliffs. The place was noted and named by Lewis and Clark on their journey west in 1805. The fire was spotted by forest ranger James O. Harrison around noon on August 5, 1949. Harrison, a college student at Montana State University, was working the summer as recreation and fire prevention guard for the Meriwether Canyon Campground. He had been a smokejumper the previous year but had given it up because of the danger. As a ranger, he still had a responsibility to watch for and help fight fires, but it was not his primary role. On this day, he fought the fire on his own for four hours before he met the crew of smokejumpers who had been dispatched from Hale Field, Missoula, Montana, in a Douglas DC-3.\n\nIt was hot, with a temperature of 97 °F, and the fire danger rating was high, rated 74 out of a possible 100. Wind conditions were turbulent. The plane flight was especially rough. One smokejumper got sick on the way and did not jump, returning with the airplane to Hale Field. Getting off the plane, he resigned from the smokejumpers. The remaining 15 smokejumpers parachuted into an open area at the top of the gulch. Below them, they could see the fire burning on the south ridge further down toward the Missouri River. Gear and individual jumpers were scattered widely due to the conditions. Their radio was destroyed after its parachute failed to open. After the smokejumpers had landed, a shout was heard coming from the front of the fire. The foreman, Wagner \"Wag\" Dodge, went out ahead to find the person shouting and to scout the fire. He left instructions for the team to finish gathering their equipment and eat, and then to cross the gully to the south slope and advance to the front of the fire. The voice turned out to be Jim Harrison who had been fighting the fire by himself for the past four hours.\n\nThe two headed back up the gulch with Dodge noting that one could not get closer to within 100 feet of the fire due to the heat. The crew met Dodge and Harrison about half way to the fire. Dodge instructed the team to move off the front of the fire, and instead move down the gulch and cross over to the thinly-forested and grass-covered north slope of the gulch; \"sidehilling\" (keeping the same contour or elevation) and moving \"down gulch\" towards the Missouri River. They could then fight the fire from the flank and steer it to a low-fuel area. Dodge returned with Harrison to the supply area at the top of the gulch. The two stopped there to eat. From the high vantage point, Dodge noticed the smoke along the fire front boiling up indicating an intensification of the heat of the fire. He and Harrison headed down the gulch to catch up with the crew.\n\nBy the time Dodge reached his men, the fire at the bottom of the gulch had already jumped from the south ridge to the bottom of the north slope. The intense heat combined with wind coming off the river and pushed the flames up-gulch into the dry grass of the north slope causing what fire fighters call a \"blow up\". Various side ridges running down the north slope obscured the crew's view, so they could not see the conditions further down the gulch, and they initially continued down toward the fire. When Dodge finally got a glimpse of what was happening below, he turned the men around and started them angling back up the gulch. Within a couple hundred yards, he ordered the men to drop packs and heavy tools (Pulaskis, shovels and crosscut saws):\n\nDodge's order was to throw away just their packs and heavy tools, but to his surprise some of them had already thrown away all of their heavy equipment. On the other hand, some of them wouldn't abandon their heavy tools, even after Dodge's order. Diettert, one of the most intelligent of the crew, continued carrying both his tools until Rumsey caught up with him, took his shovel and leaned it against a pine tree. Just a little further on, Rumsey and Sallee pass the recreation guard, Jim Harrison, who, having been on the fire all afternoon, was now exhausted. He was sitting with his heavy pack on and was making no effort to take it off\n\nBy this point, the fire was moving extremely fast up the 76% north slope (37.23 degree slope) of Mann gulch and Dodge realized they would not be able to make the ridge line in front of the fire. With the fire less than a hundred yards behind, he took a match out and set fire to the grass just before them. In doing so, he was attempting to create an escape fire to lie in so that the main fire would burn around him and his crew. In the back draft of the main fire, the grass fire set burned straight up toward the ridge above. Turning to the three men by him – Robert Sallee, Walter Rumsey and Eldon Diettert – Dodge said \"Up this way\", but the men misunderstood him. The three ran straight up for the ridge crest, moving up along the far edge of Dodge's fire. Sallee later said he wasn't sure what Dodge was doing, and thought perhaps he intended the fire to act as a buffer between the men and the main fire. It was not until he got to the ridge crest and looked back down that he realized what Dodge had intended. As the rest of the crew came up, Dodge tried to direct them through the fire he had set and into the center burnt out area. Dodge later stated that someone, possibly squad leader William Hellman, said \"To hell with that, I'm getting out of here\". The rest of the team raced past Dodge up the slope toward the hogback of Mann Gulch ridge, hoping they had enough time to get through the rock ridge line to safer ground on the other side. None of the men trying to outrun the fire entered the area Dodge had burned.\n\nFour of the men reached the ridge crest, but only two, Bob Sallee and Walter Rumsey, managed to escape through a crevice or deep fissure in the rock ridge to reach the other side. In the dense smoke of the fire, the two had no way of knowing if the crevice they found actually \"went through\" to the other side or would be a blind trap. Diettert had been just to the right, slightly upgulch of Sallee and Rumsey, but he did not drop back to the crevice and continued on up the right side of the hogback. He did not find another escape route and was overtaken by the fire. Sallee and Rumsey came through the hogback to the ridge crest above what became known as \"Rescue Gulch\". Dropping down off the ridge, they managed to find a rock slide with little to no vegetation. They waited there for the fire to overtake them, moving from the bottom of the slide to the top as the fire moved past. Hellman was caught by the fire on the top of the ridge and was badly burned. Though he and Joseph Sylvia initially survived the fire, they suffered heavy injuries and both died in the hospital the next day. Wag Dodge entered the charred center of the escape fire he had built and survived the intensely burning main fire.\n\nIn \"Young Men and Fire\", Maclean stated that when the fire passed over Dodge's position, \"he was lifted off the ground two or three times.\" Later researchers repeated the claim. However, this statement was an exaggeration. Dodge actually wrote, in his statement to the board of review, \"There were three extreme gusts of hot air that almost lifted me from the ground as the fire passed over\" In another description of Dodge's ordeal, John Maclean said, \"as the main fire passed, it [the fire] picked him up and shook him like a dog with a bone.\"\n\nAlthough \"Young Men and Fire\" attributed the story to Earl Cooley, the spotter and kicker aboard the airplane, it actually originated with C.E. \"Mike\" Hardy, who was the head of the litter bearers collecting the bodies the day after the disaster. Hardy assisted Norman Maclean in his research and accompanied him on a trip to the site.\n\nIt was originally thought that the unburned patches underneath the bodies indicated they had suffocated for lack of air before the fire caught them. This is another fallacy. In modern fire science, the unburned patches are called protected areas. The firefighters' bodies protected these areas by shielding from the intense thermal radiation, by keeping out hot gases, and absorbing heat. All of these factors kept the grass and forest litter unburned where they were lying. It is now known that death by smoke and toxic gas inhalation, while common in structure fires because of the confined atmosphere, is virtually nonexistent among wildland fire fatalities.\n\nThe events described above all transpired in a relatively short period of time. Everyone had jumped by around 4:10 p.m. The scattered cargo had been gathered at about 5:00 p.m. At about 5:45 p.m., the crew had seen the fire coming up towards them on the north slope and had turned to run. By 5:56, the fire had swept over them. The time at which the fire engulfed the men was judged by the melted hands on Harrison's pocketwatch, forever frozen at 5:56 p.m. by the intense heat. Studies estimated that the fire covered 3,000 acres in 10 minutes during this blow-up stage, an hour and 45 minutes after they had arrived. Thirteen firefighters died, with eleven killed in the fire itself and two who sustained fatal burns. Only three of the sixteen survived.\n\nThose that were killed by the fire:\nThose that survived:\n\nMuch controversy surrounded Foreman Dodge and the fire he lit to escape. In answering the questions of the Forest Service Review Board as to why he took the actions he did, Dodge stated he had never heard of such a fire being set; it had just seemed \"logical\" to him. In fact, it was not a method that the forest service had considered, nor would it work in the intense heat of the normal tall growth forest fires that they typically fought. Similar types of escape fires had been used by the plains Indians to escape the fast-moving, brief duration grass fires of the plains, and the method had been written about by James Fenimore Cooper (1827) in \"The Prairie\", but in this case Foreman Dodge appears to have invented it on the spot, as the only means available to him to save his crew. None of the men realized what it was and only Dodge was saved by it.\n\nEarl Cooley was the spotter/kicker the morning of the August 5, 1949 Mann Gulch fire jump. Cooley was the first Smokejumper to jump on an operational fire jump. The first jump was a two-man jump, and was performed on July 12, 1940. Mr. Cooley was the airborne supervisor who directed the crew of smokejumpers who dropped in to fight the Mann Gulch fire. In the 1950s Mr. Cooley served as the smokejumper base superintendent and was the first president of the National Smokejumper Association. Mr. Cooley died November 9, 2009, at age 98.\n\nThe C-47/DC-3, registration number NC24320, was the only smokejumper plane available at Hale Field, near the current location of Sentinel High School, on August 5, 1949, when the call came in seeking 25 smokejumpers to fight a blaze in a hard-to-reach area of the Helena National Forest. The C-47/DC-3 could only hold 16 jumpers and their equipment. Even though more help was needed, fire bosses decided not to wait for a second plane, and instead sent No. NC24320 out on its own. NC24320 flew with Johnson Flying Service from Hale Field in Missoula, Montana and was used to drop Smokejumpers as well as for other operations for which Johnson Flying Service held contracts. \n\nThe C-47/DC-3 that carried the smokejumpers that day was later placed on exhibit in Missoula at the Museum of Mountain Flying. The aircraft was restored as a memorial to the Smokejumpers and the Fire Guard that lost their lives at Mann Gulch on August 5, 1949. It was made airworthy and flown to France in 2019 as part of the D-Day 75th anniversary commemorations with a flight to Normandy.\nOn August 5th, 2019 The Miss Montana flew back over Mann Gulch on the 70th Anniversary of the fire and dropped wreaths for the 13 brave men lost. \n\nFour hundred fifty men fought for five more days to get the fire under control, which had spread to 4,500 acres (1,800 ha).\n\nWagner Dodge survived unharmed and died five years later of Hodgkin's disease.\n\nThirteen crosses were erected to mark the locations where the thirteen firefighters who died fighting the Mann Gulch fire fell. However, one of the smokejumpers who died in the Mann Gulch fire was David Navon, who was Jewish. In 2001 the cross marking the location where Navon died was replaced with a marker bearing a Star of David.\n\nSeveral months following the fire, fire scientist Harry Gisborne, from the U.S. Forest Service Research Center at Priest River, came to examine the damage. Despite a history of heart problems, he nevertheless conducted an on-ground survey of the fire site. He suffered a heart attack and died while finishing the day's research. Gisborne had forwarded theories as to the cause of the blowup prior to his arrival on site. Once there, he discovered several conditions, which caused him to change his concepts of fire activity, particularly those pertaining to fire \"blow-ups\". He noted this to his companion just before his death on November 9, 1949.\n\nThere was some controversy about the fire, with a few parents of the men trying to sue the government. One charge was that the \"escape fire\" had actually burned the men.\n\nLessons learned from the Mann Gulch fire had a significant effect on firefighter training. Two training protocols—\"Ten Standard Firefighting Orders\" and \"Eighteen Situations That Shout Watch Out\"—were incorporated into Forest Service firefighter training program, and safety training made mandatory to achieve certification to work on a fire line. However, the training methodology proved inadequate and the tragedy would be repeated twice, in the 1990 Dude fire in Arizona, which killed six firefighters, and in the 1994 South Canyon Fire in Colorado, in which 14 firefighters died. A primary factor in the latter appeared to be surprise of the sudden transition from surface fire to crown fire, leading to the development and adoption of LCES, an acronym for a four-point safety procedure to increase observance of the previous training protocols. LCES consists of posting \"lookouts\", providing all firefighters radio \"communication\" with lookouts, identifying \"escape routes\", and designating valid \"safety zones\", and ensuring that all members of the process, from \"hotshot\" crews to seasonal Type 2 crew volunteers to \"crew bosses\", understand and follow its tenets.\n\nSeveral factors that combined to create the disaster are described in Norman Maclean's book \"Young Men and Fire\". \n\nThe Mann Gulch Fire was the subject of Norman Maclean's book \"Young Men and Fire\", which was published after his death. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction in 1992.\n\nNorman Maclean's son John wrote a book in 2003 titled \"Fire and Ashes: On the Front Lines Battling Wildfires\", and it also includes a section on the Mann Gulch fire. In 2004, John N. Maclean also published an article called \"Fire and Ashes: The Last Survivor of the Mann Gulch Fire,\" in \"Montana: The Magazine of Western History\". The article was adapted from the Mann Gulch section of his book, in which he interviewed Bob Sallee, the last remaining survivor of the fire.\n\nJames Keelaghan wrote a song about this fire entitled \"Cold Missouri Waters\" after being inspired by \"Young Men and Fire\". The song was covered by Richard Shindell, Dar Williams, and Lucy Kaplansky on their album \"Cry Cry Cry\". It was also covered by Hank Cramer in his album, \"Days Gone By\". It was again recorded by Paul McKenna Band on their 2012 album ”Elements” and by Wolf Loescher on his 2020 album \"Sheep's Clothing\". A cover version also appears on the 2014 album ”The Call”, by Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar. In 2016, Irish singer Pauline Scanlon covered the song on her album \"Gossamer\". It is sung from the perspective of foreman Dodge, lying on his deathbed dying of Hodgkin's disease five years after the fire. It imagines Dodge saying of his decision to set the escape fire:\n\n\"I don't know why, I just thought it. I struck a match to waist-high grass, running out of time. Tried to tell them, 'Step into this fire I set. We can't make it, this is the only chance you'll get.' But they cursed me, ran for the rocks above instead. I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters.\"\n\nRoss Brown, a musician/songwriter from Townsend, MT (about 35 miles south of Helena) wrote another song entitled \"The Mann Gulch.\" A scratch version of this song is available on YouTube.\n\nThe song also has been recorded on Black Irish Band's album \"Into the Fire\" released in 2007. The album is all songs about firefighters. The album also features Michael Martin Murphey. Underneath Montana Skies is another song about the Mann Gulch fire written by Patrick Michael Karnahan also on this album.\n\nThe song was revived as a tribute to the 19 firefighters who died in the massive Yarnell Hill Fire near Yarnell, Arizona in 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

He released his debut album in 1992. Two years later, he released his first mainstream hit – \"De când te iubesc pe tine\" (Romanian: \"Since I've Been Loving You\"), featured on his second long-play record. His first album for a foreign audience was released in France, in 1996; while Romanian musical critics hardly had any reaction towards his music, the journalists abroad would show their appreciation and dub his music a very modern fashion of Gypsy jazz (including electric guitars and synthesizers).\n\nStarting around 1998 Guță developed a growing interest in manele music, a club-friendly subgenre of Balkans folk music influenced by Turkish and Arab pop, similar to what is known in former Yuguslavia as turbo-folk and narodna and in Bulgaria as chalga. Guță had an important role in the advancement of manele (which were a fairly new musical trend at that time) and brought in influences from Western pop and hip hop music.

{"id": "1900272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900272", "title": "United Nations Security Council veto power", "text": "United Nations Security Council veto power\n\nThe United Nations Security Council \"veto power\" refers to the power of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) to veto any \"substantive\" resolution. However, a permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. This veto power does not apply to \"procedural\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors.\n\nThe veto power is controversial. Supporters regard it as a promoter of international stability, a check against military interventions, and a critical safeguard against US domination. Critics say that the veto is the most undemocratic element of the UN, as well as the main cause of inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity, and is rendered mostly useless against notable human rights abuses of larger powers like the United States, China and Russia.\n\nThe veto power originates in Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, which states:\n\n\nA negative vote from any of the permanent members will block the adoption of a draft resolution. However, a permanent member that abstains or is absent from the vote will not block a resolution from being passed.\n\nAlthough the \"power of veto\" is not mentioned by name in the UN Charter, Article 27 requires concurring votes from the permanent members. For this reason, the \"power of veto\" is also referred to as the principle of \"great power unanimity\" and the veto itself is sometimes referred to as the \"great power veto\".\n\nThe idea of countries having a veto over the actions of international organisations was not new in 1945. In the League of Nations, every member of the League Council had a veto on any non-procedural issue. At the foundation of the League, there were 4 permanent and 4 non-permanent members. The League Council had expanded by 1936 to have 4 permanent and 11 non-permanent members, which meant that there were 15 countries with veto power. The existence of such a large number of vetoes made it very difficult for the League to agree on many issues.\n\nThe veto was the result of extensive discussion during the negotiations for the formation of the United Nations at Dumbarton Oaks (August–October 1944) and Yalta (February 1945). The evidence is that the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and China all favored the principle of unanimity, not only out of desire for the major powers to act together, but also to protect their own sovereign rights and national interests. Harry S. Truman, who became President of the United States in April 1945, wrote: \"All our experts, civil and military, favored it, and without such a veto no arrangement would have passed the Senate.\"\n\nAt San Francisco, the Big Five made it clear that there would be no United Nations if they weren't given the veto. Francis O. Wilcox, an adviser to the US delegation, described the dramatic negotiations: \"At San Francisco, the issue was made crystal clear by the leaders of the Big Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter at all. Senator Connally [from the US delegation] dramatically tore up a copy of the Charter during one of his speeches and reminded the small states that they would be guilty of that same if they opposed the unanimity principle. \"You may, if you wish,\" he said, \"go home from this Conference and say that you have defeated the veto. But what will be your answer when you are asked: 'Where is the Charter'?\"\n\nThe usage of the veto has gone through several distinct phases, reflecting the shifting political balance on the Security Council. From 1946 to 1969, a majority of the Security Council was aligned with the United States, which cast no vetoes because it won every vote. To block resolutions from the Western majority, the Soviet Union cast of all the vetoes. France and the United Kingdom occasionally used the veto to protect their colonial interests, and the Republic of China only used the veto once.\n\nThe Western majority eroded through the 1960s as decolonization expanded the membership of the United Nations. The newly independent countries of the Third World frequently voted against the Western powers, which led the United States to resort to the veto. After the first United States veto in 1970, the Soviet ambassador declared, \"Using your automatic majority you imposed your will on others and forced it down their throats. But times have now changed.\" From 1970 to 1991, The United States cast of the vetoes, sometimes joined by French and British vetoes. The Soviet Union cast fewer vetoes than any of the Western powers, and the People's Republic of China used the veto only once. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, there was a brief period of harmony on the Security Council. The period from 31 May 1990 to 11 May 1993 was the longest period in the history of the UN without the use of the veto. The number of resolutions passed each year also increased. Usage of the veto picked up in the early 21st century, most notably due to the Syrian Civil War. Since 1992, Russia has been the most frequent user of the veto, followed by the United States and China. France and the United Kingdom have not used the veto since 1989.\n\nAs of 30 July 2019, Russia/USSR has used its veto 141 times, United States 83 times, UK 32 times, France 18 times, and China 14 times.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council. Therefore, the veto power can be used to block the selection of a Secretary-General. Since 1981, the Security Council has selected the Secretary-General through series of straw polls. A vote by a permanent member to \"discourage\" a candidate is considered equivalent to a veto. The formal recommendation of a Secretary-General is approved unanimously by acclamation. Although the identity of the vetoing permanent member is usually known, the veto does not go on the record as a formal veto of a Security Council Resolution.\n\nEvery permanent member has vetoed at least one candidate for Secretary-General. The United States circumvented a Soviet veto in 1950 by asking the General Assembly to extend Trygve Lie's term without a recommendation from the Security Council. However, every Secretary-General since 1953 has been recommended by a unanimous vote of the permanent members of the Security Council.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1971, the Chinese seat on the Security Council was held by the Republic of China, whose Nationalist government lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and evacuated to Taiwan. During that time, its representative used the veto only once to block Mongolia's application for membership in 1955, because the ROC considered the entirety of Mongolia to be part of China. This postponed the admission of Mongolia until 1961, when the Soviet Union announced that it would block all further admissions of new members unless Mongolia were admitted. Faced with this pressure, the Republic of China relented under protest.\n\nIn 1971, the Republic of China was expelled from the United Nations, and the Chinese seat was transferred to the People's Republic of China. China first used the veto on 25 August 1972 to block Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations. From 1971 to 2011, China used its veto sparingly, preferring to abstain rather than veto resolutions not directly related to Chinese interests. China turned abstention into an \"art form,\" abstaining on 30% of Security Council Resolutions between 1971 and 1976. Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, China has joined Russia in many double-vetoes. China has not cast a lone veto since 1999.\n\nIn the early days of the United Nations, the Soviet Union was responsible for almost all of the vetoes. Because of their frequent vetoes, Soviet ambassador Andrei Gromyko earned the nickname Mr. Nyet and Vyacheslav Molotov was known as Mr. Veto. Molotov regularly vetoed the admission of new members to counter the US refusal to admit members of the Eastern Bloc. The impasse was finally resolved on 14 December 1955 when 16 countries from the Western and Eastern Blocs were simultaneously admitted to the UN.\n\nThe Soviet government adopted an \"empty chair\" policy at the Security Council in January 1950 to protest the fact that the Republic of China still held the Chinese seat at the United Nations. The Soviet Union was not present in the Security Council to veto UN Security Council Resolutions 83 (27 June 1950) and 84 (7 July 1950), authorising assistance to South Korea in the Korean War. The Soviet Union returned to the Security Council in August 1950 and resumed its usage of the veto.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation used its veto power sparingly. However, Russian vetoes became more common in the early 21st century to block resolutions on conflicts with Russian military involvement, including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine.\n\nFrance uses its veto power sparingly. The last time it unilaterally vetoed a draft was in 1976 to block a resolution on the question of the independence of the Comoros, which was done to keep the island of Mayotte as a French overseas community. It also vetoed, along with UK, a resolution calling on the immediate cessation of military action by the Israeli army against Egypt in 1956 during the Suez Crisis. France has not used the veto since 1989, when it joined the United States and United Kingdom to veto a resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama. In 2003, the threat of a French veto of resolution on the impending invasion of Iraq caused friction between France and the United States.\n\nThe United Kingdom has used its Security Council veto power on 32 occasions. The first occurrence was in October 1956 when the United Kingdom and France vetoed a letter from the USA to the President of the Security Council concerning Palestine. The most recent was in December 1989 when the United Kingdom, France and the United States vetoed a draft resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama.\n\nThe United Kingdom used its veto power, along with France, to veto a draft resolution aimed at resolving the Suez Canal crisis (in which France and UK were militarily involved) in 1956. The UK and France eventually withdrew from Egypt after the US instigated an 'emergency special session' of the General Assembly, under the terms of the \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution, which led to the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I), by the adoption of Assembly resolution 1001. The UK also used its veto seven times in relation to Rhodesia from 1963 to 1973, five of these occasions were unilateral; the only occasions on which the UK has used its veto power unilaterally. The UK has not used the veto since 1989, when it joined the United States and France to veto a resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama.\n\nAmbassador Charles W. Yost cast the first US veto in 1970 over Rhodesia, and the US cast a lone veto in 1972 to block a resolution that condemned Israel for war against Syria and Lebanon. Since then, the United States has been the most frequent user of the veto power, mainly on resolutions criticising and condemning Israel; since 2002, the United States has applied the Negroponte doctrine to veto most resolutions relating to the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict. This has been a constant cause of friction between the General Assembly and the Security Council. On 23 December 2016, the Obama administration abstained on a resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlements, the first time that the United States has. However, the United States has resumed the use of the veto in the Trump administration.\n\nThe veto power has been criticized for its undemocratic nature. A single country can prevent a majority of the Security Council from taking any action. For example, the United States routinely casts lone vetoes of resolutions criticizing Israel. The permanent members also veto resolutions that criticize their own actions. In 2014, Russia vetoed a resolution condemning its annexation of Crimea. Amnesty International claimed that the five permanent members had used their veto to \"promote their political self interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians.\"\n\nSome critics see the fact that veto power exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic, unjust, or counterproductive. Peter Nadin writes that \"The veto is an anachronism ... In the twenty-first century, the veto has come to be almost universally seen as a disproportionate power and an impediment to credible international action to crises.\" The \"enormous influence of the veto power\" has been cited as a cause of the UN's ineffectiveness in preventing and responding to genocide, violence, and human rights violations. Various countries outside the P5, such as the Non-Aligned Movement and African Union have proposed limitations on the veto power. Reform of the veto power is often included in proposals for reforming the Security Council.\n\nIt has been argued that with the adoption of the \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution by the General Assembly, and given the interpretations of the Assembly's powers that became customary international law as a result, that the Security Council \"power of veto\" problem could be surmounted. By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its \"primary responsibility\" for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded \"final responsibility\"—rather than \"secondary responsibility\"—for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes; thus rendering them little more than delays in UN action, should two-thirds of the Assembly subsequently agree that action is necessary.\n\nThe veto has also been criticized for granting the veto power to China, as it was the Republic of China, or Taiwan, who was present at the negotiations, and who fought most of the war on the Chinese side. After being expelled from the United Nations, the People's Republic of China obtained the veto, despite not being present during the initial negotiations or fighting most of the war.\n\nSupporters regard the veto as an important safeguard in international relations. Thomas G. Weiss and Giovanna Kuele called it \"a variation on the Hippocratic Oath: UN decisions should do no harm.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin praised the \"profound wisdom\" of the founders of the United Nations, referring to the veto power as the underpinning of international stability. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi lauded its \"important role in checking the instinct of war.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He resigned from NBC, citing the network's move in a direction that left him with \"fewer opportunities\" for his work. He had previously worked for \"Newsweek\", which he joined as an investigative correspondent in June 1994, and wrote extensively on the U.S. government's War on Terror, the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, campaign finance and congressional ethics abuses, presidential politics and other national issues.\n\nIsikoff had been prepared to break the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, but several hours before going to print, the article was killed by top \"Newsweek\" executives. As a result, the story broke first on Matt Drudge's \"Drudge Report\" the following morning. Isikoff's book on the subject, \"Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story\", was named Best Non-Fiction Book of 1999 by the Book of the Month Club.\n\nIsikoff was born to a Jewish family, the son of Gertrude \"Trudy\" (\"née\" Albert) and Morris Isikoff. He was raised in Syosset, New York. He has one sister.\n\nIsikoff graduated from Syosset High School on Long Island in 1970. He received his A.B. from Washington University in 1974, with a junior-year-abroad at the University of Durham, England, and obtained a masters from the Medill School of Journalism from Northwestern University in 1976.\n\nIsikoff is the co-author, with \"The Nation\" reporter David Corn, of \"\", a 2006 book about the selling of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to the U.S. public and the ensuing Plame affair. The book was a \"New York Times\" best-seller.\n\nHis online column with fellow journalist Mark Hosenball, \"Terror Watch,\" won the 2005 award from the Society of Professional Journalists for best investigative reporting online. Isikoff was a part of the \"Newsweek\" team that won the Overseas Press Club's most prestigious award, the 2001 Ed Cunningham Memorial Award for best magazine reporting from abroad for \"Newsweek\"s coverage of the War on Terror.\n\nIn the May 9, 2005, issue of \"Newsweek\", Isikoff co-wrote an article that stated that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay \"in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Quran down a toilet.\" Detainees had earlier made similar complaints, but this was the first time a government source had appeared to confirm the story. The article caused widespread rioting and massive anti-American protests throughout some parts of the Islamic world, resulting at least 17 deaths in Afghanistan. The magazine later retracted the story after noting that the anonymous official who was their source subsequently could not remember important details. A subsequent June 4, 2005, report by the Pentagon, however, confirmed multiple instances of desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo, including one incident in which a guard's urine came through an air vent and splashed on a detainee and his Quran.\n\nIsikoff was a creator of the short film \"64 Hours In October: How One Weekend Blew Up The Rules Of American Politics\" regarding events around October 7–9, 2016 relating to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n\nA September 23, 2016 \"Yahoo News\" article written by Isikoff was cited by Federal authorities in a FISA warrant application in order to justify the surveillance of Carter Page, who was alleged to have a connection to Russian authorities during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that police officials do not need a warrant to observe an individual's property from public airspace.\n\nThe Pasco County Sheriff's Office received a tip that Michael Riley was growing marijuana on his of rural property. A deputy sheriff subsequently investigated the tip and went to Riley's mobile home. Unable to see inside a greenhouse, which was behind the defendant's mobile home, the deputy circled over the property using a helicopter. The absence of two roof panels allowed the deputy to see, with his naked eye, what appeared to be marijuana growing. A warrant was obtained and marijuana was found inside the greenhouse. \n\nRiley successfully argued before the trial court that the aerial search violated his reasonable expectation of privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. The Florida Second District Court of Appeal disagreed, siding instead with the state, but the Florida Supreme Court agreed with Riley and overturned the Court of Appeal.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Florida Supreme Court with a four-vote plurality, arguing that the accused did not have a reasonable expectation that the greenhouse was protected from aerial view, and thus that the helicopter surveillance did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, the Court stopped short of allowing all aerial inspections of private property, noting that it was \"of obvious importance\" that a private citizen could have legally flown in the same airspace:\n\nAny member of the public could legally have been flying over Riley's property in a helicopter at the altitude of 400 feet and could have observed Riley's greenhouse. The police officer did no more.\n\nAlso vital to the Court's ruling was the fact that the helicopter did not interfere with the normal use of the property:\n\nAs far as this record reveals, no intimate details connected with the use of the home or curtilage were observed, and there was no undue noise, no wind, no dust, or threat of injury. In these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nJustice O'Connor felt that the plurality focused too much upon FAA regulations, \"whose purpose is to promote air safety, not to protect [Fourth Amendment rights].\" She deviated from the plurality opinion in arguing that the frequency of public flight in the airspace was a necessary concern, and that the mere legality of such flights was insufficient to determine whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy:\n\n[I]t is not conclusive to observe, as the plurality does, that \"[a]ny member of the public could legally have been flying over Riley's property in a helicopter at the altitude of 400 feet and could have observed Riley's greenhouse.\" Nor is it conclusive that police helicopters may often fly at 400 feet. If the public rarely, if ever, travels overhead at such altitudes, the observation cannot be said to be from a vantage point generally used by the public and Riley cannot be said to have \"knowingly expose[d]\" his greenhouse to public view.\n\nNevertheless, O'Connor concurred with the plurality opinion because she thought the defendant still needed to show that public use of the relevant airspace was uncommon. The Justice closed by saying flights less than in altitude \"may be sufficiently rare that police surveillance from such altitudes would violate reasonable expectations of privacy.\"\n\nJustice Brennan, joined by Marshall and Stevens, strongly believed that the plurality had misstated the issue, agreeing with O'Connor that the frequency of public air travel was a necessary consideration, and that the key issue in the case was whether ordinary citizens were normally in the air above the defendant's home:\n\nThe police officer positioned 400 feet above Riley's backyard was not, however, standing on a public road. The vantage point he enjoyed was not one any citizen could readily share. His ability to see over Riley’s fence depended on his use of a very expensive and sophisticated piece of machinery to which few ordinary citizens have access.\n\nHowever, Brennan disagreed with O'Connor in that he believed the defendant did not necessarily need to show that public flight was rare, but rather that the state needed to show that it was common:\n\nBecause the State has greater access to information concerning customary flight patterns and because the coercive power of the State ought not be brought to bear in cases in which it is unclear whether the prosecution is a product of an unconstitutional, warrantless search, the burden of proof properly rests with the State and not with the individual defendant. The State quite clearly has not carried this burden.\n\nJustice Blackmun recognized that five of the nine justices (O'Connor and the four dissenters) had agreed that \"the reasonableness of Riley's expectation [of privacy] depends, in large measure, on the frequency of non-police helicopter flights at an altitude of 450 feet.\" Like Brennan, Blackmun noticed that the main disagreement among these five justices was whether the government or the defendant had the burden of proof in establishing whether public flights above Riley's home were common or rare. Blackmun thought it was likely that such flights were quite rare, supporting Riley's case, so the government had to show they occurred with some regularity. He wrote that \"burdens of proof relevant to Fourth Amendment issues may be based on a judicial estimate of the probabilities involved.\"\n\n\n"}

It has a deep taproot which makes it tolerant to drought and gives it a good soil structuring effect. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets), each leaflet long and broad, green with a characteristic pale crescent in the outer half of the leaf; the petiole is long, with two basal stipules that are abruptly narrowed to a bristle-like point. The flowers are dark pink with a paler base, long, produced in a dense inflorescence, and are mostly visited by bumblebees.\n\nThe red clover is native to Europe, Western Asia, and northwest Africa, but it has been naturalized in other continents, like North and South America. Specifically, the red clover was brought to Argentina and Chile over 100 years ago, although it is not clear how exactly it was introduced. The red clover has become increasingly important as a source of economic stability in Chile, which has made the need for pollinators even more important. One important pollinator, which was also brought from Europe, is \"Bombus ruderatus\", or the large garden bumblebee. This bumblebee has been one of the important pollinators of red clover in South America and other countries such as New Zealand.\n\nIt is widely grown as a fodder crop, valued for its nitrogen fixation, which increases soil fertility. For these reasons, it is used as a green manure crop. Several cultivar groups have been selected for agricultural use, mostly derived from \"T. pratense\" var. \"sativum\". It has become naturalised in many temperate areas, including the Americas and Australasia as an escape from cultivation.\n\nDue to its beauty, it is used as an ornamental plant.\n\nRed clover's flowers and leaves are edible, and can be added as garnishes to any dish. They can be ground into a flour.\n\nThe flowers often are used to make jelly and tisanes, and are used in essiac recipes. Their essential oil may be extracted and its unique scent used in aromatherapy.\n\n\"Trifolium pratense\" is used in traditional medicine of India as deobstruent, antispasmodic, expectorant, sedative, anti-inflammatory and antidermatosis agent.\n\nIn alternative medicine, red clover is promoted as a treatment for a variety of human maladies, including symptoms of menopause, coughs, disorders of the lymphatic system and a variety of cancers. Several systemic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that red clover extract reduces the frequency of menopause hot flashes. Most added that further research is needed to confirm the results. There is no evidence in the human trial literature that red clover has been tested for effects on cough, lymphatic system or cancer prevention/treatment. Dietary amounts of red clover are safe, but dietary supplement extracts may cause rash-like reactions, muscle ache, headache, nausea, vaginal bleeding in women, and slow blood clotting.\n\nRed clover contains coumestrol, a phytoestrogen. Due to its activity on oestrogen receptors, red clover is contraindicated in people with a history of breast cancer, endometriosis, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, uterine fibroids or other oestrogen-sensitive conditions, although some authors have suggested the high isoflavone content counteracts this, and even provides benefits in these conditions. It is said to be a blood cleanser.\n\nDue to its coumarin derivatives, \"T. pratense\" should be used with caution in individuals with coagulation disorders or currently undergoing anticoagulation therapy.\n\nIt is metabolised by CYP3A4 and therefore caution should be used when taking it with other drugs using this metabolic pathway.\n\nRed clover is subject to bacterial as well as fungal diseases, including the red clover rust, \"Uromyces trifolii-repentis\" var. \"fallens\". Other problems include parasitic nematodes (roundworms) and viruses.\n\n\"Trifolium pratense\" is the national flower of Denmark and the state flower of Vermont.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900320", "title": "Multimodal therapy", "text": "Multimodal therapy\n\nMultimodal therapy (MMT) is an approach to psychotherapy devised by psychologist Arnold Lazarus, who originated the term \"behavior therapy\" in psychotherapy. It is based on the idea that humans are biological beings that think, feel, act, sense, imagine, and interact—and that psychological treatment should address each of these \"modalities\". Multimodal assessment and treatment follows seven reciprocally influential dimensions of personality (or \"modalities\") known by their acronym \"BASIC I.D.\": behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonal relationships, and drugs/biology.\n\nMultimodal therapy is based on the idea that the therapist must address these multiple modalities of an individual to identify and treat a mental disorder. According to MMT, each individual is affected in different ways and in different amounts by each dimension of personality, and should be treated accordingly for treatment to be successful. It sees individuals as products of interplay among genetic endowment, physical environment, and social learning history. To state that learning plays a central role in the development and resolution of our emotional problems is to communicate little. For events to connect, they must occur simultaneously or in close succession. An association may exist when responses one stimulus provokes, are predictable and reliable, similar to those another provokes. In this regard, classical conditioning and operant conditioning are two central concepts in MMT.\n\n\"BASIC I.D.\" refers to the seven dimensions of personality according to Lazarus. Creating a successful treatment for a specific individual requires that the therapist consider each dimension, and the individual's deficits in each.\n\n\nMultimodal therapy addresses the fact that different people depend on or are more influenced by some personality dimensions more than others. Some people are prone to deal with their problems on their own, cognitively, while others are more likely to draw support from others, and others yet are likely to use physical activities to deal with problems, such as exercise or drugs. All reactions are a combination of how the seven dimensions work together in an individual. Once the source of the problem is found, treatment can be used to focus on that specific dimension more than the others.\n\nMMT starts after the patient has been assessed based on his/her emotional responses, sensory displays and the manner in which he/she interacts with people around via behavior, effect, sensations, images, cognition, drugs and interpersonal activities. \n\nBased on this assessment, the therapist will introduce the patient to the first session. During this time, the therapist and the patient will create a list of problems and the suitable treatments that may suit him/her the most. Since the treatment is based upon individual cases, each remedial strategy is considered as an effective method for the patients. \n\nPost the completion of the initial assessment, a more detailed diagnosis is done using questionnaires. The therapist shall diagnose both the actual profile as well as the structural profile of the patient. Such a diagnosis will define the target which both the therapist and the patient would want to achieve once the treatment is complete. Here, the therapist will evaluate different other ways to treat the patient. Often, relaxation tapes are used to calm down the patient. Besides psychotherapy, the therapist will try to include dietary measures and stress management programs to treat patient's associated psychiatric symptoms. The prime focus of the therapist would be to ease the pains of the patient and fulfill his/her needs by studying his/her behavior and mannerisms. \n\nUpon the patient's prior consent, the therapist will tape all the sessions and furnish a copy of those tapes to the patient. These tapes act as a supporting resource when the therapist is evaluating the patient's behavior. MMT is a flexible mode of psychotherapy because each treatment plan is devised keeping all the possibilities in mind. In the case of a single patient, the duration of the session could last not more than few hours, depending upon the therapist's analysis of the concerned patient's behavior. However, if the patient shows a condition that needs multiple treatments, then the session could stretch farther so as to enable the therapist to analyse the patient further.\n\nMultimodal therapy originated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a fusion of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy. Behavior therapy focused on the consideration of external behaviors, while cognitive therapy focused on mental aspects and internal processes; combining the two made it possible to utilize both internal and external factors of treatment simultaneously.\n\nArnold Lazarus added the idea that, since personality is multi-dimensional, treatment must also consider multiple dimensions of personality to be effective. His idea of MMT involves examining symptoms on each dimension of personality in order to find the right combination of therapeutic techniques to address them all. Lazarus retained the basic premises of CBT, but believed that more of the individual's specific needs and personality dimensions must be considered.\n\n"}
{"id": "1900321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900321", "title": "Live fish trade", "text": "Live fish trade\n\nThe live fish trade can refer to the live food fish trade (for human consumption) or to the ornamental fish trade (for aquariums). The fish can come from many places, but most comes from Southeast Asia.\n\nThe live food fish trade is a global system that links fishing communities with markets, primarily in Hong Kong and mainland China. Many of the fish are captured on coral reefs in Southeast Asia or the Pacific Island nations.\n\nWithin the live food trade there are certain types of fish demanded more often by consumers, particularly smaller and medium-sized fish. According to the book While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade consumer demand has caused the fish captured on coral reefs to be the most valued fish in the trade. Consumers are important because they are directly purchasing these fish species at restaurants and stores. In addition to these types of fishes, many juvenile fish are used for the live food trade. There are also cultural and regional preferences among consumers, for example, Chinese consumers often prefer their fish to be reddish in color believing the color to be auspicious. These preferences inevitably affect the biodiversity of marine life making certain fish species rarer to find.\n\nThe life fish food trade is a lucrative business. According to University of Washington Professor Patrick Christie, live fish caught for food export earns approximately $6000 a ton. To help support themselves and their families, fishermen in Oceania and Southeast Asia sometimes use illegal fishing methods. Although many feel the fish are worth the cost, a typical dinner can cost up to one hundred dollars per kilogram. The wholesale value on these fish is anywhere from eleven US dollars to sixty-three US dollars per kilogram, meaning there’s a large markup and resale value. (Hong Kong alone is estimated to be about four hundred million US dollars a year.) Because this trade frequently uses illegal methods of collecting (using cyanide), there is no way to know for sure how much money is being made each year on live fish trade, although estimates conclude probably over one billion US dollars each year.\n\nAs is often the case, consumers are willing to pay large amounts of money on rare and fresh fish. One 500-pound, polka-dot grouper, estimated to be more than a century old, was hacked into fillets by seven kitchen workers in about half an hour, the Economist reports. It was expected to bring about $15,000.\n\nThe center for the Live Food Fish Trade is located in Hong Kong -- the markets consumers contribute $400 million to the estimated $1 billion of the trades global value. Total imports flowing into Hong Kong included 10153 metric tons, of which 30 percent was re-exported to mainland China. Other major markets include Singapore, mainland China, and Taiwan. The primary suppliers of wild caught fish are Indonesia (accounting for nearly 50 percent of Hong Kong's imports), Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam. However, Taiwan and Malaysia are leading the charge towards farmed live fish specializing in an industry that \"harvested annually has probably been in the billions [Metric Tons]\". Farming live fish is gaining popularity as tastes for live fish are burgeoning across South Asia and countries look to become more and more self sustainable, this is appareant in nations with sizable Chinese populations such as Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nHong Kong and China are the dominant markets for the live fish, in addition to other cities in the region that have large Chinese populations, including Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. In Southeast Asia, Singapore alone consumes 500 tons of live coral fish a year. Exports from Southeast Asia rose to over 5,000 tons in 1995 from 400 tons in 1989. However, in 1996, exports declined by 22%. Indonesia, which accounts for over 60% of the harvest, saw exports falling by over 450 tons. That same year, other Southeast Asian countries have experienced similar drops in stocks of live coral fish for food. In 1996, the Philippines' exports were halved, while Malaysian exports declined by over 30%. These decreases in catch have been due to the excessive amount of fish caught for exports and the degradation of the coral reefs from such procedures.\n\nThe live fish trade is a complex issue that involves many different perspectives, all of which must be considered in trying to approach a solution. While, at first, one may point the finger at the fishermen themselves as the criminals, there are many other factors. One is the economic disparity of many of the communities that take part in cyanide, dynamite, or other illegal fishing practices. 40% of the Filipino population and 27% of the Indonesian population is considered to be in poverty. Many whose livelihood once depended on fishing or agriculture are realizing it is more lucrative to participate in illegal fishing activities.\n\nCommunity members who are not a part of the trade are affected by the activities of these illegal fishers. The cyanide fishers profit by taking away from everyone else’s trade and food. ‘\"If people were using poison and my take dropped to only a little, I would accept it\",’ Puah said. ‘\"But I feel heartsick…I catch nothing at all. I have not caught a big fish in a month so there’s no point in going fishing this afternoon\".’” The local people are often helpless to protect themselves, as government and law enforcement officials have “open pockets” and are also involved in the trade by turning a blind eye to the illegal actions and receiving a take of the profits. “Culpability in cyanide use cannot be understood apart from the larger structures of corruption that permeates resource extraction throughout Indonesia. The Indonesian State bureaucracy extends from Jakarta down to the village level, and radiates out into villages through kinship connections. It is the factor most tightly correlated with illegal trade in natural resources throughout Indonesia.”\n\nCoral reefs found in the South Pacific are regarded as the \"rainforest of the sea\" harboring countless fish species large and small. However, recently the live fish trade has threatened the sanctity of these endangered areas. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has issued a recent report that estimates that 25% of the world's reefs are severely damaged and another third are in grave danger. The live fish trade is part of this alarming ecological trend caused by the popular use of cyanide which is injected into the coral reefs to stun inhabiting fish so they can be easily caught by nets. It is estimated that since the 1960s, more than one million kilograms of cyanide has been squirted into Philippine reefs alone, and since then the practice has spread throughout the South Pacific. The live fish trade is only growing, in 1994 the Philippines exported 200,000 kg of live fish; by 2004 the Philippines were annually exporting 800,000 kg annually. Although Asian markets are the primary buyers of live reef fish for food, the recently created U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has concluded that the U.S. is the primary purchaser of live reef fish for aquariums as well as eclectic jewelry. Even though the use of cyanide in the live fish trade is severely detrimental, one must realize that this issue is multidimensional. Small-scale native fishermen of the small South Pacific coastal communities are the backbone of the live fish trade, and are forced to resort to the illegal use of sodium cyanide due to demand and high prices offered by the industry.\n\nWhile live food fish trade can be very profitable for those involved, there are many dangerous aspects to it. Through the use of illegal practices such as cyanide fishing, coral reefs and fish communities are put in grave danger. The process of cyanide fishing involves dissolving crushed cyanide tablets and squirting this solution from a bottle toward the targeted fish on top of coral heads. Specifically, the cyanide kills coral polyps, symbiotic algae, and other coral reefs organisms that are necessary for maintaining the health of the coral reef. These damages eventually deteriorate the coral reef and lead it into collapse of the entire coral reef ecosystem. The effect on the targeted fish is disorientation and semi-paralysis. After being squirted with cyanide, the fish are easy brought to the surface and kept alive in small, on-board containers. Fishermen often understand that this practice is harmful and will offer locals a portion of the fish in order to continue fishing. When ingested, small levels of cyanide accumulate in the system causing weakness of fingers and toes, failure of the thyroid gland and blurred vision. Divers without experience may come in direct contact with cyanide, causing death. Estimates show that since the 1960s, over a million kilograms of cyanide have been squirted into the coral reefs of the Philippines alone. The harm upon the reefs is coming full circle and having a social impact through the limited fish stocks. As fish are depleted from these fishing techniques, the fishermen are having a more difficult time feeding themselves.\n\nAdditionally, the use of explosives may be used as a fishing technique in the live food fish trade. While the majority of these fish do not survive the blast of such explosions, the remaining fish that are only stunned are collected for the live food fish trade. The use of cyanide makes a stronger argument in that the more coral reef fish captured alive, the more lucrative the catch is for the fisherman. Live fish, according to the [WWF], fetch five times more than a dead fish. This is why banning the live-fish trade would similarly harm the reefs. Fisherman would resort to the \"dead fish trade\", be forced to deal in a larger quantity of fish, and the process of dangerous fishing techniques continues. To illustrate the effects of repeated explosions in the proximity of a coral reef system, roughly one half of the coral reefs in Komodo National Park in Indonesia have been destroyed. The use of cyanide and explosives in fishing proves to be an effective technique in catching fish, but its powers are indiscriminating and as a result the coral reefs are being held hostage to such practices. The future of the reefs are in question just as are the futures of those who subsist from them because \"from a long term perspective, the question of ethics of using the ocean...contains a commitment for future generations\".\n\nIn communities like those in the Philippines and Indonesia, people are participating in the live food fish trade because it is a source of income, or at least a source of temporary income. For some communities this is one of the few income-generating opportunities. Along with the environmental, ecological, and economic consequences of this industry, there are serious health risks as well. Because of inadequate training and lack of quality equipment, divers, especially young men are in large risk of paralysis.\n\nBecause of the great profitability of this industry, there is a great incentive to identify sustainable practices. The Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) works to offer the hobbyist with a product that is certified as environmentally sound and sustainable. Additionally, the International Marinelife Alliance (IMA), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and MAC are working with the Hong Kong Chamber of Seafood Merchants to develop standards for the live fish trade. The Hong Kong Seafood Merchants represent ninety percent of the buyers of live reef food fish in Hong Kong and have an extensive impact on collection practices.\n\nIn an effort to address the damage inflicted on coral reef eco-systems and fish stocks, aquaculture is being utilized to reduce pressure on coral reefs. However, initial efforts to farm grouper have met with significant challenges. There are difficulties with fragile grouper seed that can make it more expensive than wild caught larvae, which can affect natural replenishment rates. Additionally, there are problems with finding suitable food, disease and cannibalism.\n\nEfforts are also being made in regards to the aquarium fish trade. Juvenile fish are being captured and raised specifically for the industry. However, there are debates as to whether this practice will affect replenishment rates. “The age of the juveniles is pivotal to the debate, harvesting of postlarvae from the water column is considered to have a much lower (negligible) impact on rates of replenishment than the removal of the larger juveniles from benthic habitats because the postlarvae have yet to undergo severe mortality”. If studies determine that the capture of juveniles is sustainable, it may help in mitigating the damage from cyanide fishing.\n\nAquaculture production, specifically grouper rearing is rapidly expanding in Asia. From 1998 to 2001 the Indo-Pacific countries involved in aquaculture; China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand witnessed a 119 percent increase in output. The explosion in this practice can most likely be attributed to the large profit margins that can be derived in very little time. It is estimated that the majority of farms after annual returns can be paid back in less than one year. In comparison to other species of fish such as the Milkfish, the Grouper, because of high demand is able to garner high rates of return, in order to earn 1,000 dollars a grouper farm would only have to raise 400 kilograms in contrast to 5,000 kilograms of Milkfish.\n\n\n"}

TESLA had a state-sponsored monopoly on electronics production in Czechoslovakia, and produced nearly all electronic products in the country until 1989. Many subsidiaries were created from the original brand, including those at Liptovský Hrádok, Hradec Králové, Pardubice, Žďár nad Sázavou, Bratislava, and Nižná. Later, some of them were transformed into independent state-owned companies.\n\nThis was officially reported by Radioamator in October 1946: Tesla the National Enterprise was set up on 10 August at the Mikrofon Factory in Strašnice with the participation of Yugoslavian Minister Zlataric Branko, Minister of Industry of North Macedonia Vasilijev Georgie, Minister of Industry of B. Laušman, representatives of government, institutions and universities. The enterprise was named after a genial Slavic technician and it documents the effort for convergence and cooperation among all Slavic nations. The main task of nationalized industry is to quickly overcome all post-war troubles and woes, and to create a socially healthy and productive work environment. Then the Minister declared Tesla as established.\n\nThe company had a wide range of production: TVs, radio receivers, transistors, integrated circuits, screens, speakers, turntables, disc and cassette recorders, CD players, video cassettes etc. However, quantity usually did not meet the needs of industrial customers and many products gradually became obsolete simply because they were not updated; e.g. one particular type of diode was manufactured for over 30 years without modifications.\n\nOther products, e.g. some kinds of silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) or power transistors were competitive with the world market and so TESLA was the supplier for all eastern Europe countries. Some high quality products were even exported to western countries, for example, the turntables NC 470 or NC 500 under the tradename Lenco.\n\nThe most well-known international Tesla product was the Tesla 308U Talisman bakelite radio designed by Igor Didov of Tesla Bratislava and made by several Tesla company branches between 1953 and 1958 and reel-to-reel tape recorder Sonet duo (1959-1965). It was also known for its military passive radar KRTP-86 Tamara (TESLA Pardubice, 1986), which was claimed to be the only one in the world able to detect military \"invisible aircraft\".\n\nTESLA had to contend with both foreign and new domestic competition after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, and had difficulty competing effectively, which resulted in dramatic downsizing and privatization of the majority of its stores and production facilities. TESLA's logo is a rare sight in the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia, as only a few of its subsidiaries have survived. One of its former subsidiaries, the Slovak JJ Electronic in Čadca is known for its production of vacuum tubes and TESLA Litovel is known for its production of high-end turntables known as Pro-Ject. The direct successor in the Czech Republic is TESLA, joint-stock company of Praha- Hloubětín. It owns a trademark in more than 80 countries in the world.\n\nAfter series of actions taken by Tesla a.s. against Tesla Motors Inc. the contract between Tesla Holding a.s. and Tesla Motors Inc. was signed on 06.10.2010 stating a coexistence of TESLA trademarks and regulating relationships between them. \nPreamble to the Tesla trademarks coexistence agreement:\n(A) Tesla Motors owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA.¨\n(B) Tesla Holding owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA.\n(C) Tesla Holding and Tesla Motors wish to enter into a coexistence agreement relating to the TESLA trademark.\n\nIn 2015, the first primary battery comes to market under the trade name Tesla Batteries.\n\nFormer TESLA companies with new name:\n\nSome of the present TESLA companies:\n"}

{"id": "1900338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900338", "title": "Critical band", "text": "Critical band\n\nIn audiology and psychoacoustics the concept of critical bands, introduced by Harvey Fletcher in 1933 and refined in 1940, describes the frequency bandwidth of the \"auditory filter\" created by the cochlea, the sense organ of hearing within the inner ear. Roughly, the critical band is the band of audio frequencies within which a second tone will interfere with the perception of the first tone by auditory masking.\n\nPsychophysiologically, beating and auditory roughness sensations can be linked to the inability of the auditory frequency-analysis mechanism to resolve inputs whose frequency difference is smaller than the critical bandwidth and to the resulting irregular \"tickling\" of the mechanical system (basilar membrane) that resonates in response to such inputs. Critical bands are also closely related to auditory masking phenomena – reduced audibility of a sound signal when in the presence of a second signal of higher intensity within the same critical band. Masking phenomena have wide implications, ranging from a complex relationship between loudness (perceptual frame of reference) and intensity (physical frame of reference) to sound compression algorithms.\n\nFilters are used in many aspects of audiology and psychoacoustics including the peripheral auditory system. A filter is a device that boosts certain frequencies and attenuates others. In particular, a band-pass filter allows a range of frequencies within the bandwidth to pass through while stopping those outside the cut-off frequencies.\n\nThe shape and organization of the basilar membrane means that different frequencies resonate particularly strongly at different points along the membrane. This leads to a tonotopic organisation of the sensitivity to frequency ranges along the membrane, which can be modeled as being an array of overlapping band-pass filters known as \"auditory filters\". The auditory filters are associated with points along the basilar membrane and determine the frequency selectivity of the cochlea, and therefore the listener's discrimination between different sounds.\nThey are non-linear, level-dependent and the bandwidth decreases from the base to apex of the cochlea as the tuning on the basilar membrane changes from high to low frequency. The bandwidth of the auditory filter is called the critical bandwidth, as first suggested by Fletcher (1940). If a signal and masker are presented simultaneously then only the masker frequencies falling within the critical bandwidth contribute to masking of the signal. The larger the critical bandwidth the lower the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the more the signal is masked.\n\nAnother concept associated with the auditory filter is the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB). The ERB shows the relationship between the auditory filter, frequency, and the critical bandwidth. An ERB passes the same amount of energy as the auditory filter it corresponds to and shows how it changes with input frequency. At low sound levels, the ERB is approximated by the following equation according to Glasberg and Moore:\n\nwhere the ERB is in Hz and f is the centre frequency in Hz.\n\nIt is thought that each ERB is the equivalent of around 0.9mm on the basilar membrane. The ERB can be converted into a scale that relates to frequency and shows the position of the auditory filter along the basilar membrane. For example, an ERB number of 3.36 corresponds to a frequency at the apical end of the basilar membrane whereas an ERB number of 38.9 corresponds to the base and a value of 19.5 falls half-way between the two.\n\nOne filter type used to model the auditory filters is the gammatone filter. It provides a simple linear filter, which is therefore easy to implement, but cannot by itself account for nonlinear aspects of the auditory system; it is nevertheless used in a variety of models of the auditory system. Variations and improvements of the gammatone model of auditory filtering include the gammachirp filter, the all-pole and one-zero gammatone filters, the two-sided gammatone filter, and filter cascade models, and various level-dependent and dynamically nonlinear versions of these.\n\nThe shapes of auditory filters are found by analysis of psychoacoustic tuning, which are graphs that show a subject's threshold for detection of a tone as a function of masker parameters.\n\n<div>Psychoacoustic tuning curves can be measured using the notched-noise method. This form of measurement can take a considerable amount of time and can take around 30 minutes to find each masked threshold. In the notched-noise method the subject is presented with a notched noise as the masker and a sinusoid (pure tone) as the signal. Notched noise is used as a masker to prevent the subject hearing beats that occur if a sinusoidal masker is used. The notched noise is noise with a notch around the frequency of the signal the subject is trying to detect, and contains noise within a certain bandwidth. The bandwidth of the noise changes and the masked thresholds for the sinusoid are measured. The masked thresholds are calculated through simultaneous masking when the signal is played to the subject at the same time as the masker and not after.\n\nTo get a true representation of the auditory filters in one subject, many psychoacoustic tuning curves need to be calculated with the signal at different frequencies. For each psychoacoustic tuning curve being measured, at least five but preferably between thirteen and fifteen thresholds must be calculated, with different notch widths. Also a large number of thresholds need to be calculated because the auditory filters are asymmetrical, so thresholds should also be measured with the notch asymmetric to the frequency of the signal. Because of the many measurements needed, the amount of time needed to find the shape of a person's auditory filters is very long. To reduce the amount of time needed, the ascending method can be used when finding the masked thresholds. If the ascending method is used to calculate the threshold the time needed to calculate the shape of the filter is reduced dramatically, as it takes around two minutes to calculate the threshold. This is because the threshold is recorded when the subject first hears the tone, instead of when they respond to a certain stimulus level a certain percentage of the time.\n\nThe human ear is made up of three areas: the outer, middle and inner ear. Within the inner ear sits the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail-shaped formation that enables sound transmission via a sensorineural route, rather than through a conductive pathway. The cochlea is a complex structure, consisting of three layers of fluid. The scala vestibuli and scala media are separated by Reissner's Membrane whereas the scala media and scala tympani are divided by the basilar membrane. The diagram below illustrates the complex layout of the compartments and their divisions:\nThe basilar membrane widens as it progresses from base to apex. Therefore, the base (the thinnest part) has a greater stiffness than the apex. This means that the amplitude of a sound wave travelling through the basilar membrane varies as it travels through the cochlea. When a vibration is carried through the cochlea, the fluid within the three compartments causes the basilar membrane to respond in a wave-like manner. This wave is referred to as a 'travelling wave'; this term means that the basilar membrane does not simply vibrate as one unit from the base towards the apex.\n\nWhen a sound is presented to the human ear, the time taken for the wave to travel through the cochlea is only 5 milliseconds. \nWhen low-frequency travelling waves pass through the cochlea, the wave increases in amplitude gradually, then decays almost immediately. The placement of vibration on the cochlea depends upon the frequency of the presented stimuli. For example, lower frequencies mostly stimulate the apex, in comparison to higher frequencies, which stimulate the base of the cochlea. This attribute of the physiology of the basilar membrane can be illustrated in the form of a place–frequency map:\nThe basilar membrane supports the organ of Corti, which sits within the scala media. The organ of Corti comprises both outer and inner hair cells. There are approximately between 15,000 and 16,000 of these hair cells in one ear. Outer hair cells have stereocilia projecting towards the tectorial membrane, which sits above the organ of Corti. Stereocilia respond to movement of the tectorial membrane when a sound causes vibration through the cochlea. When this occurs, the stereocilia separate and a channel is formed that allows chemical processes to take place. Eventually the signal reaches the eighth nerve, followed by processing in the brain.\n\nAuditory filters are closely associated with masking in the way they are measured and also the way they work in the auditory system. As described previously the critical bandwidth of the filter increases in size with increasing frequency, along with this the filter becomes more asymmetrical with increasing level.\n\nThese two properties of the auditory filter are thought to contribute to the upward spread of masking, that is low frequencies mask high frequencies better than the reverse. As increasing the level makes the low frequency slope shallower, by increasing its amplitude, low frequencies mask high frequencies more than at a lower input level.\n\nThe auditory filter can reduce the effects of a masker when listening to a signal in background noise using off-frequency listening. This is possible when the centre frequency of the masker is different from that of the signal. In most situations the listener chooses to listen 'through' the auditory filter that is centred on the signal however if there is a masker present this may not be appropriate. The auditory filter centred on the signal may also contain a large amount of masker causing the SNR of the filter to be low and decreasing the listeners ability to detect the signal. However, if the listener listened through a slightly different filter that still contained a substantial amount of signal but less masker, the SNR is increased, allowing the listener to detect the signal.\n\nThe first diagram above shows the auditory filter centred on the signal and how some of the masker falls within that filter. This results in a low SNR. The second diagram shows the next filter along the basilar membrane, which is not centred on the signal but contains a substantial amount of that signal and less masker. This reduces the effect of the masker by increasing the SNR.\n\nThe above applies to the power-spectrum model of masking. In general this model relies on the auditory system containing the array of auditory filters and choosing the filter with the signal at its centre or with the best SNR. Only masker that falls into the auditory filter contributes to masking and the person's threshold for hearing the signal is determined by that masker.\n\nIn a 'normal' ear the auditory filter has a shape similar to the one shown below. This graph reflects the frequency selectivity and the tuning of the basilar membrane.\n\nThe tuning of the basilar membrane is due to its mechanical structure. At the base of the basilar membrane it is narrow and stiff and is most responsive to high frequencies. However, at the apex the membrane is wide and flexible and is most responsive to low frequencies. Therefore, different sections of the basilar membrane vibrate depending on the frequency of the sound and give a maximum response at that particular frequency.\n\nIn an impaired ear, however the auditory filter has a different shape compared to that of a 'normal' ear.\n\nThe auditory filter of an impaired ear is flatter and broader compared to a normal ear. This is because the frequency selectivity and the tuning of the basilar membrane is reduced as the outer hair cells are damaged. When only the outer hair cells are damaged the filter is broader on the low frequency side. When both the outer and inner hair cells are damaged the filter is broader on both sides. This is less common. The broadening of the auditory filter is mainly on the low frequency side of the filter. This increases susceptibility to low frequency masking i.e. upward spread of masking as described above.\n\n\n"}

As news of the rising spread throughout Kildare, Kilcullen rebels began to mobilise in the ancient hill-top churchyard in the townland now known as Old Kilcullen. About 200 had gathered by daybreak, including a number of survivors of the attack on Ballymore-Eustace, when they were spotted by local military under the command of Lieutenant General Ralph Dundas, Commander of the Army of the Midlands, whose headquarters, Castle Martin, was located only three miles away. Dundas quickly mustered a combined force of about 120 infantry, cavalry and dragoons and marched to disperse the rebel gathering.\n\nThe 80 or so cavalry and dragoons raced ahead of the infantry and upon arrival at the base of the hill, charged the rebel gathering. The rebels however, quickly entrenched themselves on three sides by using a ditch and the walls of the ruined church and graveyard to protect their flanks. The cavalry were driven back by the long pikes of the rebels, losing over thirty of their number and many of their horses in the fighting. Two of their captains lay dead on the field, one of whom, a Captain Erskine, reportedly met his death after the battle. As he lay disabled with a broken leg from a horse fall he was discovered by an old woman scavenging the battlefield who stabbed him to death with a rusty knife. The rebels threatened to take advantage of the disarray of the cavalry with their own attack but the eventual arrival of infantry shielded the survivors withdrawal to Kilcullen Bridge where they were reinforced by about 100 local yeomen.\n\nAs news of the Government defeat spread through Kilcullen and the surrounding area, the rebel army swelled with recruits until it numbered almost 1,000 men. The rebel leadership then decided to quickly follow up their victory by cutting off the remaining garrison from the Dublin Road thereby cutting communications between Dublin and the south. The rebels forded the river Liffey downstream from Kilcullen Bridge and occupied the high ground on both sides of the road at Turnpike Hill.\n\nDundas, by now no longer underestimating his opponents, devised a ruse to draw the rebels down from the high ground by sending a small party of cavalry ahead, their orders were to avoid combat and lure the rebels into prepared lines of fire. The rebels took the bait and chased after the advance party only to be hit by several musket volleys from the waiting soldiers. When the rebels reached the Liffey in disarray, the cavalry were unleashed and scattered them, killing about 150 for no reported losses on the Government side.\n\nDespite achieving a crushing victory, Dundas was shaken by his earlier defeat, the attacks on isolated garrisons and news of the spreading rebellion. As Commander of the Army of the Midlands, he decided to consolidate his position by issuing a general order for all Crown forces under his command to withdraw to Naas, in effect abandoning much of the county to the rebels. In his haste to evacuate the town, a number of soldiers and some of their wounded from the earlier fighting were left behind and killed by the rebels.\n\nThe rebels defeated by General Dundas at Turnpike Hill, amassed themselves on Knockaulin hill (the ancient site of Dún Ailinne) near Old Kilcullen. On Saturday 26 May they began to negotiate a surrender. When Dundas replied favourably to the rebels overture for peace, they delivered terms. They would surrender themselves and their arms and return to their homes, provided the free-quarters would end and plundered property was restored. While Dundas may have been favourable to negotiate terms and end hostilities, the government was indignant and sent General Gerard Lake, Commander-in-Chief of the army, to Castlemartin.\n\nBy the time Lake arrived on Sunday, Dundas had agreed that the surrender would take place the next day, Whit Monday. Patrick O'Kelly, aged 17, was chosen to accept the surrender on behalf of the rebels and was appointed a Colonel so he could properly treat with General Dundas. The meeting was cordial but Lake refused any terms, other than the complete surrender of the rebels in the avenue of Castlemartin. O'Kelly said the rebels would only surrender on the hill. Despite Lake's objections, Dundas climbed Knockaulin.\n\nThe presence of Dundas greatly mollified the rebels disappointment at the refusal of terms, and the men began to deposit their arms and return home. The subsequent pile of arms was the size of the Royal Exchange, according to O'Kelly in his General History of the Rebellion of 1798, and these were later removed to Castlemartin. This avoided a planned assault by Lake as he had three regiments of infantry and four pieces of artillery lying within one mile of Castlemartin, ready to engage the rebels if necessary.\n\n"}

The name in English was derived from the Dutch burgemeester. In some cases, Burgomaster was the title of the head of state and head of government of a sovereign (or partially or de facto sovereign) city-state, sometimes combined with other titles, such as Hamburg's First Mayor and President of the Senate). Contemporary titles are commonly translated into English as \"mayor\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, the mayor ( or ) is an appointed government position, whose main responsibility is chairing the executive and legislative councils of a municipality. \n\nIn the Netherlands, mayors chair both the council of mayor and aldermen and the municipal council. They are members of the council of mayor and aldermen (, B&W) and have their own portfolios, always including safety and public order. They also have a representative role for the municipal government, both to its civilians and to other authorities on the local, regional and national level.\n\nA large majority of mayors are members of a political party. This can be the majority party in the municipal council, but there are many exceptions on this. However, the mayors are expected to exercise their office in a non-partisan way.\n\nThe mayor is appointed by the national government (the Crown) for a renewable six-year term. In the past, mayors for important cities were often chosen after negotiations (behind the screens) between the national parties. This appointment procedure has been criticised because it was seen by some as undemocratic. Especially the party D66 had a direct election of the mayor as one of the main objectives in its platform. In the early 2000s, proposals for change were discussed in the national parliament. However, opponents of the status quo were divided between two alternatives: direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the municipal council. A constitutional change to direct election gained a majority in both chambers but failed to pass the final vote in the Senate in March 2005.\n\nIn the meantime, although the law remained the same, the practice changed. Nowadays, when a vacancy occurs, a special committee of the municipal council interviews (behind closed doors) candidates, which are pre-selected by the provincial governor (the King's Commissioner). After advice by the committee, the council express its preferences to the Minister of the Interior, who almost always follows this recommendation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1900364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900364", "title": "Rotuman language", "text": "Rotuman language\n\nRotuman, also referred to as \"Rotunan\", \"Rutuman\" or \"Fäeag Rotuma\", is an Austronesian language spoken by the indigenous people of the South Pacific island group of Rotuma, an island with a Polynesian-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of Fiji in 1881. Classification of Rotuman is difficult because of the large number of loan words from Samoan and Tongan, as a result of much cultural exchange over the history of the Pacific. Linguist Andrew Pawley groups the language with the West Fijian languages in a West Fijian–Rotuman branch of the Central Pacific subgroup of Oceanic languages.\n\nThe Rotuman language has sparked much interest with linguists because the language uses metathesis to invert the ultimate vowel in a word with the immediately preceding consonant, resulting in a vowel system characterized by umlaut, vowel shortening or extending and diphthongisation.\n\nUnlike its Pacific neighbours, Rotuman is typically considered an AVO (agent–verb–object) language.\n\nRotuman has no phonemic vowel length and is underlyingly a language of open syllables. Thus, only consonant + vowel syllables exist in the underlying syllable structure, although phonological processes provide for more variation. A minimal word constraint that disallows words of less than two moras also alters this underlying representation. Except for words from non-lexical categories, a word like ('tomorrow') is realized as . That constraint applies before word compounding (including reduplication as well): ('coral reef') + ('deep sea') → ('deep sea pool'). Vowels are also lengthened when both final and stressed.\n\nNon-high vowels are raised when they are followed by a syllable with a high vowel.\n\nGenerally speaking, when is followed by within a metrical foot, it is fronted to .\n\nAn important aspect of Rotuman morphonology is what could be called the \"incomplete\" and \"complete\" phases although they have also been referred to as \"long\" and \"short\" forms, \"primary\" and \"secondary\" forms, \"absolute\" and \"construct\" cases, and \"proper and original\" and \"altered or construct\" forms. The complete phase applies to semantically-definite or specific terms. Otherwise, in normal conversation (excluding song, poetry and chant), the incomplete phase applies to all but the last morpheme of a word and all but the last word of a phrase. That can lead to syllable-final consonants in the language, which has an underlying all-open syllable system.\n\nThe above table (C indicates any consonant) shows that metathesis and deletion are important parts of incomplete phase formation. The final vowel and the immediately-preceding consonant metathesize from VCV#, to VVC# where V is any underlying penultimate vowel, V is any underlying ultimate vowel, C is any consonant, and # is the word, phrase, or morpheme boundary.\nAfter metathesis, \"V is deleted if V is not further back than V and if V is not lower than V\" or if the two vowels are identical. Further processes of elision result in coalescence or spreading of features: back vowels are fronted before front vowels of equal or greater height ( and/or affect and just affects ) before the latter are deleted.\n\nIn addition, the → rule takes effect again, now outside of the moraic foot, and can occur with a following and both . Also, becomes \"after\" a syllable with a high vowel ( or ). When V is higher than V, it is devocalized to the corresponding semivowel; for front vowels and for back vowels.\n\nWord stress is associated with left-dominant bimoraic feet. The penultimate mora of nonderived words carries the stress. LOther than the nominalizing suffix || and the causative suffix ||, stress is assigned before additional morphemes are affixed and before incomplete phase morphonology.\n\nUpon missionary contact, various orthographies abounded on the island of Rotuma. The French Catholic missionaries devised an orthography based on their own alphabet, and the primarily-English Wesleyan Methodist preachers developed their own orthography to write in Rotuman. The prevalent one used today is one from the Australian Methodist Reverend C. M. Churchward, whose knowledge of linguistics devised the Tongan orthography as well. Here is the alphabet, as it appears in Churchward's seminal work, \"Rotuman Grammar and Dictionary\":\n\n\nFor the variations to the vowels \"a\", \"o\" and \"i\", Churchward's dictionary treats these letters as if no variation between the species occurred within the base letter: the word \"päega\", meaning \"seat\", appears before \"pạri\" meaning \"banana\", which, in turn, appears before \"pau\", meaning very much.\n\nIn addition, there are instances of all original vowels above appearing with a macron, indicating\nthat they are longer, although vowel length is arguably a phonological process.\n\nBecause Churchward's alphabet was created before a sufficient analysis of Rotuman phonology, it is not purely phonemic. George Milner proposed a more phonemic spelling without diacritics, which incorporates the understanding of vowel allophony as having to do with metathesis (see above)\n\nThis is the Rotuman language version of the Lord's prayer, as found in the translation of the Bible published in 1975 (Matthew 6:9–13) . It is written using the diacritics of Churchward's orthography:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900370", "title": "Silent e", "text": "Silent e\n\nIn English orthography, many words feature a silent (single, final, non-syllabic <e>), most commonly at the end of a word or morpheme. Typically it represents a vowel sound that was formerly pronounced, but became silent in late Middle English or Early Modern English.\n\nIn a large class of words, as a consequence of a series of historical sound changes, including the Great Vowel Shift, the presence of a suffix on the end of a word influenced the development of the preceding vowel, and in a smaller number of cases it affected the pronunciation of a preceding consonant. When the inflection disappeared in speech, but remained as a historical remnant in the spelling, this silent was reinterpreted synchronically as a marker of the surviving sounds. \n\nThis can be seen in the vowels in word-pairs such as \"rid\" and \"ride\" , in which the presence of the final, unpronounced appears to alter the sound of the preceding . An example with consonants is the word-pair \"loath\" (loʊθ) and \"loathe\" (loʊð), where the can be understood as a marker of a voiced . \n\nAs a result of this reinterpretation, the was added by analogy in Early Modern English to many words which had never had a pronounced -inflection, and it is used in modern neologisms such as \"bike\", in which there is no historical reason for the presence of the other than the need to mark the pronunciation of the preceding vowel.\n\nAlthough Modern English orthography is not entirely consistent here, the correlation is common enough to allow a rule-of-thumb to be used to explain the spelling, especially in early schooling, where a silent which has this effect is sometimes called a magic or bossy . Structured Word Inquiry uses the term silent . \n\nDepending on dialect, English has anywhere from 13 to more than 20 distinct vowel phonemes, both monophthongs and diphthongs. A silent , in association with the Latin alphabet's five vowel characters, is one of the ways by which some of these vowel sounds are represented in English orthography. \n\nA silent in association with the other vowels may convert a short vowel sound to a long vowel equivalent, though that may not always be the case. The short vowels are while the equivalent long vowels are . However, because of the complications of the Great Vowel Shift, the long vowel is not always simply a lengthened version of the corresponding short one; and in most cases (for example with \"ride\") is in fact a diphthong (). \n\nTo create a long vowel, there is usually only one consonant between the silent and the preceding vowel. In some cases two consonants may also have the same effect, as in \"table\", \"paste\" and \"bathe\", while in other cases no consonants are also found, as in \"tie\", \"toe\" and \"due\". The presence of a double consonant may indicate that the is not silent and does not affect the preceding vowel (as in \"Jesse\" and \"posse\").\n\nIn English, the \"letter name\" of a vowel is its long vowel form (except in the case of , which has the same pronunciation as – compare \"byte/bite\").\n\nThis terminology reflects the historical pronunciation and development of those vowels, but as a phonetic description of their current values it may no longer be accurate. The English values of the letters used to be similar to the values those letters had in Spanish, French or Italian, namely , , , , . The Great Vowel Shift leading to Early Modern English gave current English \"long vowels\" values that differ markedly from the \"short vowels\" that they relate to in writing. Since English has a literary tradition that goes back into the Middle English period, written English continues to use Middle English writing conventions to mark distinctions that had been reordered by the chain shift of the long vowels. However, the pronunciation of before silent , found mainly in borrowings from French and Latin, is a consequence not of the Great Vowel Shift but of a different series of changes.\n\nWhen final is \"not\" silent, this may be indicated in various ways in English spelling. When representing , this is usually done via doubling (\"employee\", with \"employe\" as an obsolete spelling, \"refugee\"). Non-silent can also be indicated by a diacritical mark, such as a grave accent (\"learnèd\") or a diaeresis (\"learnëd, Brontë\"). Other diacritical marks are preserved in loanwords (\"résumé\", \"café\", \"blasé\"), or introduced on this pattern (\"maté\"), though these diacritics are frequently omitted. Other words have no indication that the is not silent (\"pace\", Latin loan meaning \"with due respect to\"). \n\nThe sounds of the group are some of the more dialectically-complex features of contemporary modern English; the phonemes represented in modern \"short\" include , , and . See \"broad A\" and \"cot–caught merger\" for some of the cross-dialect complexities of the English group. A silent typically moves to .\n\nSilent typically moves to . This change is generally consistent across nearly all English dialects today, though previously many dialects used instead before migrating to . Some parts of Mid-Ulster English still use .\n\nFor the \"long vowel\" represented in written English by , the effect of silent is to turn it into a diphthong .\n\nShort often falls in with short and shares some of the complexities of that group. Variously, the written short can represent , , and . The usual effect of silent on written is to fix it as a long sound.\n\nShort can variably represent either or , as a result of the \"foot–strut\" split. Silent generally turns to its corresponding long version , which developed from Middle English. Variably by dialect and even word, the in this may drop (\"rune\" , \"lute\" ), causing a merger with ; in other cases, the coalesces with the preceding consonant (\"issue\" → ), meaning that the silent can affect the quality of a consonant much earlier in the word (\"educate\" (, \"nature\" ).\n\nIn addition to indicating that a preceding vowel is a long vowel, a silent when it immediately follows a (c) or (g) also indicates that the (c) is a soft and (g) is a soft. For example:\n\n\nwhere is the expected outcome of the digraph, and the in \"huge\" is pronounced . The same effect on (c) and (g), but not the preceding vowel, arises in words such as “chance”, “change” and “forge”. To stop this softening effect, a silent (u) is added before (e), as in “plague”, “fugue” and “catalogue.”\n\nSilent is used in some words with in which it does not lengthen a vowel: \"rĭdgɇ\", \"slĕdgɇ\", \"hŏdgɇ-pŏdgɇ\". Spelling such words with , the other letter that indicates that sound, does not occur in native or nativized English words.\n\nThe same softening effect ( and ) also arises with a following (i) or (y).\n\nIn word final position, a similar softening effect can occur with the digraph ; often the form with the is a verb related to the noun form without the e:\n\nIn some common words that historically had long vowels, silent no longer has its usual lengthening effect. For example, the in \"come\" (as compared to in \"cone\") and in \"done\" (as compared to in \"dome\"). This is especially common in some words that historically had instead of , such as \"give\" and \"love\"; in Old English, became when it appeared between two vowels (OE \"giefan, lufu\"), while a geminated lost its doubling to yield in that position. This also applies to a large class of words with the adjective suffix \"-ive\", such as \"captive\" (where, again, the is not lengthened, unlike in \"hive\"), that originally had \"-if\" in French. \n\nSome loanwords from French (\"promenade\") retained their French silent , called \"e muet\" or \"e caduc\", which has no effect on the preceding vowel. Also, the feminine forms of some words of French origin end in a silent , for example \"fiancée\" and \"née\".\n\nSome English words vary their accented syllable based on whether they are used as nouns or as adjectives. In a few words such as \"minute\", this may affect the operation of silent : as an adjective, \"minúte\" (, \"small\") has the usual value of followed by silent , while as a noun \"mínute\" (, the unit of time) silent does not operate. See initial-stress-derived noun for similar patterns that may give rise to exceptions.\n\nHistorically, following the French usage, it was the practice to add a silent at the end of words for aesthetic purposes. For example, words ending in \"-le\" (as in \"subtle\" and \"table\") as well as following an (s) (such as \"house\" and \"tense\", etc) have a redundant silent .\n\nA silent is usually dropped when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added to a word, for example: \"cope\" to \"coping\", \"trade\" to \"tradable\", \"tense\" to \"tension\", \"captive\" to \"captivate\", \"plague\" to \"plaguing\", \"secure\" to \"security\", \"create\" to \"creator\", etc. However, this is inconsistently applied, as in the case of \"liveable\". In the case of the \"-ment\" suffix, there is also a divergence of practice. In American English, \"judge\" usually becomes \"judgment\", while in British English the e is usually retained, as in \"judgement\". Other words with an uncertain practice include \"movement\", \"incitement\", \"involvement\", besides others.\n\nA silent is not usually dropped in compound words, such as \"comeback\".\n\nSilent , like many conventions of written language that no longer reflect current pronunciations, was not always silent. In Chaucer's \"Balade\", the first line does not scan properly unless what appears to current eyes to be a silent is pronounced:\n\n\"Gilte\" ends in the same sound as modern English \"Malta\". In Middle English, this final schwa had some grammatical significance, although that was mostly lost by Chaucer's time. It was elided regularly when a word beginning with a vowel came next. The consequences of silent in contemporary spelling reflect the phonology of Middle English. In Middle English, as a consequence of the lax vowel rule shared by most Germanic languages, vowels were long when they historically occurred in stressed open syllables; they were short when they occurred in \"checked\" or closed syllables. Thus \"bide\" had a long vowel, while \"bid\" had a short one.\n\nThe historical sequence went something like this:\n\nThe writing convention of silent indicates that different vowel qualities had become phonemic, and were preserved even when phonemic vowel length was lost.\n\nLong vowels could arise by other mechanisms. One of these is known as \"compensatory lengthening\"; this occurred when consonants formerly present were lost: \"maid\" is the modern descendant of Old English \"mægde\". In this example, the \"g\" actually became a glide , so in a sense, the length of the consonant stayed where it always had been, and there was no \"compensation.\" The silent rule became available to represent long vowels in writing that arose from other sources; Old English \"brŷd\", representing *\"bruʒd-i-\", became Modern English \"bride\". \n\nThe rules of current English spelling were first set forth by Richard Mulcaster in his 1582 publication \"Elementarie\". Mulcaster called silent \"qualifying \", and wrote of it:\nIt altereth the sound of all the vowells, euen quite thorough one or mo consonants as, máde, stéme, éche, kínde, strípe, óre, cúre, tóste sound sharp with the qualifying E in their end: whereas, màd, stèm, èch, frind, strip, or, cut, tost, contract of tossed sound flat without the same E, And therefor the same loud and sharp sound in the word, calleth still for the qualifying e, in the end, as the flat and short nedeth it not. It qualifyeth no ending vowell, bycause it followeth none in the end, sauing i. as in daie, maie, saie, trewlie, safetie, where it maketh i, either not to be heard, or verie gentlie to be heard, which otherwise would sound loud and sharp, and must be expressed by y. as, deny, aby, ally. Which kinde of writing shalbe noted hereafter. It altereth also the force of, c, g, s, tho it sound not after them, as in hence, for that, which might sound henk, if anie word ended in c. in swinge differing from swing, in vse differing from vs.\n\nMulcaster also formulated the rule that a double letter, when final, indicated a short vowel in English, while the absence of doubling and the presence of silent made the vowel long. In modern English, this rule is most prominent in its effects on the written \"a\" series:\n\nDigraphs are sometimes treated as single letters for purposes of this rule:\n\n\n\n"}

From then on, he took up residence in the temple behind the library, where he would hull rice and chant sutras.\n\nThe few accounts of him record that he became close friends to Hanshan, and was the one who found the orphaned Shide, named him, and brought him to the temple. From these and other anecdotes, it appears that Feng was the oldest of the three.\n\nThe circumstances of his death are as murky as his life: the stories in which Feng is any more than a name or foil for Hanshan cease after he healed a local prefect. It has been conjectured that Hanshan's Poem 50 refers to his death:\n\nVery few of Feng's poems survive, but the ones which do are very revealing; the third of the four confirms Feng's relationships with the other members of the Tientai Trio:\n\nThe first of the poems appears to confirm the stories of how he was an itinerant monk prior to stopping at Kuoching Temple (and even then he would depart at least once for a pilgrimage to Mount Wutai):\n\nThe fourth poem is especially important, since it unmistakably references the challenge the Fifth Patriarch of Zen set his would-be successors ~713 C.

But it appears that his poetry's formal structures were fairly conventional, and in ideas, from a strictly Buddhist perspective; Hanshan, in contrast, often played with rhymes and tones and structure, and very often dropped in Taoist references, to the point where his actual religious orientation is in some doubt.

{"id": "1900398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900398", "title": "Environmental issues in Puget Sound", "text": "Environmental issues in Puget Sound\n\nPuget Sound is a deep inlet of the Pacific Ocean in Washington, extending south from the Strait of Juan de Fuca through Admiralty Inlet. It was explored and named by Captain George Vancouver for his aide, Peter Puget, in 1792.\n\nThe ninth Puget Sound Update, from the Puget Sound Action Team reports that:\n\nThe abundance of creatures and foliage allowed for the native peoples of the area to thrive and prosper by harvesting it. Many of the problems of the Puget Sound originated from explorers and trappers hunting and killing the indigenous species off of which the natives thrived and prospered. In the past 30 years there has been a large recession in the populations of the species which inhabit the Puget Sound. The decrease has been seen in the populations of: forage fish, salmonids, bottom fish, marine birds, harbor porpoise and orcas. This decline is attributed to environmental issues in Puget Sound. Because of this population decline, there have been changes to the fishery practices, and an increase in petitioning to add species to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). There has also been an increase in recovery and management plans for many different area species.\n\nThe cause of these environmental issues are, toxic contamination, eutrophication (low oxygen due to excess nutrients), and near shore habitat changes. The Puget Sound has been affected by urbanization and the toxic pollutants it produces. As a government document regarding this issue says, \"A major contributor of these toxic pollutants entering the Sound is the stormwater that runs off our highways, roads, driveways, roofs, parking lots, disturbed soils, and other developed surfaces.\" They also talk about the loss of habitat. In the last 125 years, the Puget Sound has lost or damaged 70 percent of their habitats including the salt marshes, eelgrass beds and the estuaries.\n\nPuget Sound, Washington is a body of water lying east of Admiralty Inlet, through which ocean waters reach inland some from the Pacific Coast to complex and intricate system of channels, inlets, estuaries, embayments and islands. Industries in this area include aerospace, military, biotechnology, fishing, electronics, computers, forest products, marine industries, telecommunications, transportation and other commerce industries.\n\nDue to improper storage methods for dangerous chemicals, such as arsenic, areas of soil and aquatic land in Puget Sound are being managed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).\n\nStandards for the storage and discharge of industry chemicals have improved, and Puget Sound remains vital to the industries that depend upon it, such as shipping ports.\nPorts in Washington are diverse. Governed as municipalities, the ports operate shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and associated infrastructure, such as roads, railroads and parks. The fastest-growing part of Washington ports is industrial development.\n\nThe Puget Sound region has been rapidly growing. According to the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), a board that plans for growth in the four central counties of the area (Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish and King counties), the combined population of these counties was nearly 3.4 million residents in 2003.\n\nTimes have changed since the 1970s, when a billboard in Seattle read \"the last person to leave Seattle please turn out the lights\". Between 1970 and 2000, the Puget Sound region's population increased by 1.3 million people. The 12-county Puget Sound region, including Seattle and Tacoma, has quadrupled to four million people since the 1950s, and the state predicts one million more residents by 2025. The PSRC predicts that between 2000 and 2020 the region will increase by 1.7 million people. Another change the region faces involves the demographics of its population. The segment of its population ages 65 and older is projected to increase by 150 percent, making up 17 percent of the total population by 2040.\n\nThe expansion of Microsoft and Boeing has spurred an economic growth in the area. This has major environmental implications, including pollution runoff and the altering of important shorelines. \"One-third of Puget Sound shoreline has already been altered\".\n\nUnder the Growth Management Act (GMA), local governments plan, coordinate and manage for growth in Washington, while protecting natural resources and public interests. The GMA requires local governments to develop long-term comprehensive plans for land uses in their jurisdictions. Plans must be coordinated with surrounding counties and be approved by a regional board. Finally, as part of the GMA, local governments must address sensitive fish and wildlife areas through Critical Area Ordinances (CAOs).\n\nHood Canal is a fjord off the Puget Sound. Hypoxia is a low-oxygen condition occurring in Hood Canal. One overriding factor of this is the underwater topography of the canal. While the shallowest part of the canal is its entrance, where the ledge, or sill, of the canal measures only 150 feet (46 m) deep, the deepest parts of the canal are more than 600 feet (180 m) deep. The Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP) and the United States Geological Service (USGS) are studying Hood Canal circulation, trying to model the tidal circulations and salinity distribution patterns between the canal and Admiralty Inlet. Other factors that, when combined with the constrictive shape, could also influence hypoxia in Hood Canal are:\n\n\nThe picture surrounding hypoxia in Hood Canal is complex; research models point to more than one contributing factor: Nutrient level. Nutrient level is a large issue due to the human impact. The supply of nutrients, primarily nitrates, to the euphotic zone is thought to impact levels of dissolved oxygen. Nutrients feed algae, which under the right conditions, \"bloom\" and then die and decompose; the entire process requires a large amount of oxygen. This decreases the oxygen in the water column, lowering the dissolved oxygen level.\n\nThere are both natural and man-made sources of nutrients. The primary natural source is in ocean water that flushes Hood Canal. Man-made sources include leaking septic systems, storm water runoff, agriculture and various other sources causing nutrient pollution. The presence of nutrients leads to algae growth, which consumes oxygen when the algae die and decompose, contributing to the low oxygen conditions in these waters.\n\nAnother factor mentioned by the HCDOP is the influence of the ocean water. The ocean water that enters Hood Canal is like most estuaries: fresh, warm water flows out at the surface and is replaced by cold, salty water at depth. The cold, salty ocean water that enters Hood Canal comes into Puget Sound from the open ocean and has not recently been in contact with the atmosphere. As a result, this water is initially somewhat depleted in oxygen.\n\nOxygen levels will fluctuate throughout the year; this is due to seasonal changes in nutrient availability, solar radiation, and water column stratification (layers of water of different density, temperature, and salinity). Low oxygen conditions are at their worst in the late summer, after several months of limited flushing and maximum plankton production near the surface. In some years, oxygen becomes sufficiently depleted that animals cannot survive. These kills may occur either locally or over a wide area.\n\nCombined sewage overflow (CSO) has been occurring in the Puget Sound. CSO occur during rain events when runoff with the combination of raw sewage overflows the pipes and it carries pollutants, harmful pathogens, and excess nutrients directly into Puget Sound. This is a threat to the biodiversity of marine wildlife as it degrades/damages the marine habitat. Due to high amounts of excess nutrients and water disturbance, there are fewer number of benthic invertebrate species found near CSO outfalls. One of the nutrients found in excess amounts is Nitrogen, which can cause low oxygen level. Excess nitrogen can causes algae blooms which leads to low oxygen level which is dangerous for marine organism that need oxygen. \nFurthermore, at the outfall the output disturbs the soils, which makes the water more turbid. Turbid water can increase the number of pathogens in the water. Many fishes and shellfish can be affected by some pathogens that are naturally found in the Puget Sound. High turbidity can decrease light penetration which can decrease food sources for fishes. If the turbidity is high enough it can kill fishes and/or affect reproduction and growth. \nOther pollutants carried by the runoff can have direct harm on many marine organisms and pollute the soils. For example, heavy metal buildup can cause physiological and reproductive harm. For example, lead in river otters and spotted sandpiper affect their reproduction. Furthermore, build-up in pollutants has been found to affect fish growth.\nTo reach standards stated in the Clean Water Act, Washington State must have a long-term CSO Control Plan so that 1 or fewer overflow events occur on average in a year.\n\nKing County, Washington, US, has two plans to help improve CSO impacts on the environment: CSO Long-term Control Plan and the Integrated Plan Alternative. The Integrated Plan presents management of both runoff and sewage overflow, while the Long-term Control Plan focuses on decreasing sewage overflow. At various locations, King County monitors and assesses the water quality at CSO outfall locations. Between 1979 and 2012 King County working with the City of Seattle has been able to decrease CSO by about 1.5 billion gallons.\nThe Integrated Plan Alternative is implemented by Seattle Public Utilities and expected to be completed by 2025. The purpose of the plan is to reduce pollutants entering the water. It has suggested three methods: (1) increasing the number of streets that are swept; (2) build a water quality facility in South Park to remove pollutants; and (3) maintaining existing rain gardens and/or natural drainage systems. \nThe CSO Long-term Control Plan is to be completed by 2030. There are four main strategies in the plan to decrease CSO impact on the environment: (1) underground storage tanks/tunnel; (2) Wet Weather treatment stations; (3) Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI); and (4) repairing/replacing existing outfalls/pipes. Underground storage tanks/tunnels are being built in North Beach, Magnolia, West Seattle, and Rainer Valley. Wet Weather treatment stations are being built in Elliot West and Henderson/MLK. GSI are being built at Barton, Highland Park, and South Green Park. At Salmon Bay (Ballard) and Leschi (Lake Washington) old outfalls and pipes are being replaced or repaired. \nThe underground storage tank in Magnolia will be able to hold 1.5 million gallon during CSO events, which will eventually flow to the CSO treatment center in Smith Cove. The architecture of the facility was structured to collect and filter runoff by creating a rain garden. It helps clean water and provides habitat for wildlife such as birds, bees, and butterflies.\n\nKing County has decreased the CSO discharge into the Puget Sound, however soils are still polluted due to past CSO discharges. The Sediment Management Plan was first created in the 1990s to deal with soil pollution at CSO outfalls. The cleanup methods include capping, dredging, and source control/natural recovery. \nCSO outfalls of concern include the sites at Duwamish/Diagonal, King Street, Hanford Street, Lander Street, Brandon Street, Denny Way, Norfolk Street, and Pier 53-55. At Denny Way CSO outfall, the polluted soil was removed through dredging and then improved the habitat by refilling the sea floor with clean soils to mimic surround area.\n\nAccording to the 2007 Puget Sound Update:\nAquatic vegetation is a key component of the near shore environment that supports the ecosystem through primary production and by providing habitat to numerous species of fish, invertebrates, birds, and mammals.\n\nPuget Sound is home to a diverse assemblage of aquatic plants and algae, each with unique habitat requirements. Major threats to submerged aquatic vegetation include physical disturbance, loss of water clarity, and excessive nutrients.\n\nKnown to be important ecosystem components that are sensitive to anthropogenic stressors, eelgrass and kelp species are commonly recognized indicators of aquatic vegetation health.\nThere are twenty six species of kelp which grow along Washington’s shorelines, which makes it one of the highest sites of kelp diversity in the world.\nChanges in the oceans kelp have direct effect on other species. This is particularly due to the unique three-dimensional habitats that the plants provide for invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals. Widespread loss of kelp throughout Puget Sound would have repercussions for the marine ecosystem as a whole.\n\nEelgrass (\"Zostera marina\") is an underwater grass that thrives in marine and estuarine water bottoms and spreads through rhizomes, or roots. It has been estimated by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that Puget Sound is occupied by approximately of eelgrass. Research has shown that eelgrass beds in Puget Sound can be found in two different habitats: flats, which can be described as either large, shallow bays or small \"pocket\" beaches, and fringe beds along steep shorelines. Beds of eelgrass provide a vital link in the nearshore foodweb, creating underwater forests for biota such as salmon, herring, sand lance, and numerous invertebrates.\n\nEelgrass beds provide nutrients and shelter for various biota in Puget Sound. As eelgrass and other seagrasses decay, it combines with other dead matter. This rich detritus is a staple for invertebrates, which are fed upon by salmonids, birds and other predators. Eelgrass functions as a protective cover from the predators for juvenile salmon and as a nursery for herring that deposit eggs among bed. Herring, in turn, are an important food source for juvenile and adult salmon.\n\nDuring low tide, eelgrass beds shelters other small animals from extreme temperatures, and in tideflats the beds act as a sponge for moisture.\n\nEelgrass monitoring is conducted throughout Puget Sound using random sampling under the Submerged Vegetation Monitoring Program, Washington Department of Natural Resources, Nearshore Program. Results for 2003–2004 were posted in 2005. Many eelgrass populations were holding steady, but sharp declines were noted in five shallow bays in the San Juan Islands and 14 smaller sites in the greater Puget Sound. Eelgrass throughout the entire Hood Canal showed a steady decline.\nIn eleven embayments there was almost of eelgrass lost between 1995 and 2004.\n\nA number of reasons contribute to the decline in eelgrass population, including, but not limited to:\n\n\nThe Puget Sound Conservation and Recovery Plan (2005–2007) outlines a number of goals for improving management and health of the state's eelgrass beds. These include increasing protection over eelgrass beds on state-managed aquatic lands, and developing a statewide \"seagrass management conservation plan\" to be used by local, state and federal agencies.\n\n60% of the ground fish populations are currently considered, by the areas scientific community, to be in acceptable or good conditions. The populations which are in decline are: middle-trophic level predators such as rockfish, spiny dogfish, Pacific cod, and hake.\n\nThere was a spawning decline for copper and quillback rockfish of close to 75% between 1970 and 1999; more recent data shows a continued decline. Many rockfish species which are popular to harvest in the area are showing large population decreases, while less popular species are showing signs of increased population.\n\nThe Puget Sound has 19 Pacific herring stocks; the populations from all have decreased since 2002. The largest decreases are found in the north Puget Sound area; where stocks dropped form roughly 12,000 tons of spawning biomass to 4,000 tons in 2004. The Cherry Point stock had particularly large decreases.\n\nThe harbor porpoise was once very abundant in the Puget Sound. However, its population declined to the point that it was rarely seen in the 1970s and 1980s. Its population has increased somewhat and it can now be seen in localized areas.\n\nOrcas in the south Puget Sound were added to the federal endangered species list in 2005. In 2007 their population numbered 86 (down from their peak population number of 98 in 1975).\n\nThe populations of sea lions in Washington State have increased. Steller sea lions specifically are showing an increase in population; 10% every year.\n\nThe populations of harbor seals have been on the rise since the early 1970s. In 2007 there were approximately 14,000 harbor seals in the inland waters of Puget Sound alone.\n\nPopulations of the pinto abalone have sharply decreased due to the inability of the species to naturally reproduce. Between 1992 and 2005, in 10 long term monitoring stations, their populations declined from 351 animals per site, to 103 per site.\n\nThe population of Olympia oyster (\"Ostrea Lurida\"), been declining due to sewage contamination and the effects of sulfur liquor emissions (from pulp mills). Both of these things were shown to have serious effects on the reproductive part as well as the health part of \"Ostrea lurida\". Some other problems include mining, logging, and boat traffic. Pollution like gasoline and motor oil from the boats is harmful to the species of oyster as well. The Journal of Shellfish Research states, \"Although oysters may be able to tolerate brief exposure to motor oil and gasoline by closing their shell, up to 14% population mortality increases after 10 days [of exposure]\". As the article states, another large problem for Olympia oysters is the human-caused sedimentation caused by topsoil runoff in areas of logging or mining. The sedimentation leads to murky waters and oysters that are buried under layers of runoff as well as non-secure places to inhabit.\n\nThere are over 100 species of marine bird which rely on the Puget Sound as habitat. A survey completed by the Western Washington University (WWU) reports that the total number of marine birds in the Puget Sound is decreasing. The cause of this decrease in population is not clear, although researchers suspect likely causes such as pollution, non-native species, and collisions with man made structures, abandoned or lost fishing gear, some fishing practices, unavailable food sources, and loss of habitat.\n\nThere has been a decline of surf scoters, white scoters, and black scoters. This decrease of scoters is the largest decrease in biomass of marine birds over the past 25 years in Puget Sound.\n\nThe loons and grebes which over-winter in Puget Sound have shown a population decrease of 75% in the past 10 years. (It is not known if this decline is due to a population decrease or a change in their winter location).\n\nUnder provisions of the ESA, two salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest have been listed as endangered, but none within the Puget Sound. One of the factors that contribute to declining salmon runs in Puget Sound, and the Pacific Northwest in general, is the lack of logjams in rivers. Logjams are essential to the survival of healthy salmon populations. Logjam and river current interaction carve deep pools into riverbeds, providing salmon and their young, also known as fry, with hiding places from predators. Logjams also force some of the water from the main river to spill out over the adjacent Floodplain, forming Tributaries along the river, which supply ideal habitat for maturing salmon. The natural processes of spawning and reaching maturity become much more difficult for salmon without the services logjams provide.\n\nAlso, as the organisms that salmon feed on begin to dwindle due to factors including overfishing and invasive species, salmon are further threatened as their food sources become precarious, as is the case with herring populations around Puget Sound (Puget Sound Action Team).\nFor more information see Salmon conservation.\n\nThe increased urbanization around streams connected to the Puget Sound has led to the annual increase in premature (adult salmon who have not yet spawned) spawner mortality rates. The exposure to metals and petroleum hydrocarbons which originate from motor powered vehicles in the urban area, have led to the recurring fish kills. Salmon that transition from saltwater to freshwater are vulnerable to the toxic substances found in the urban streams.\n\n\"Nearshore\" is most commonly defined as the backshore, intertidal and shallow subtidal areas of shoreline. In Washington, for example, the Shoreline Management Act defines the upland edge of this area to be behind the shoreline. Many groups also consider the nearshore to go fairly deep beyond the intertidal zone.\n\nMore than 10,000 streams and rivers drain into Puget Sound. Approximately of shoreline surround the estuary, which is a mosaic of beaches, bluffs, deltas, mudflats and wetlands. A number of factors have been listed as potentially contributing to continued degradation of the nearshore environment. These include changing the nearshore by adding artificial structures, such as Tide gates and bulkheads increased pollution from various sources, such as failing septic systems; and various impacts from agricultural and industrial activities. One-third of more than of Puget Sound shoreline has been modified by some form of human development, including Armoring, Dredging, filling and construction of overwater structures.\n\nThe \"Seattle Post\" reported that there are 17 species currently under protection from the Federal Endangered Species Act in the Puget Sound area. There are:\n\nEndangered:\n\n\nThreatened:\n\n\nUnprotected species that are \"critically imperiled\":\n\nAquatic nuisance species are non-native plants or animals that threaten the diversity or abundance of native species; the Ecological stability of infested waters; or the commercial, agricultural or recreational activities that depend on such waters. In recent years, the Puget Sound has seen an increase of invasive species, specifically from Japan, as early as 1971. Invasive species have come to the Puget Sound via several factors, including aquaculture, importation of live seafood, shipping (attached to ship hulls and through ballast water), research and academic institutions, deliberate introductions, pet stores and public aquaria, and natural dispersal. The Japanese wire weed \"Sargassum muticum\" and the marine grass \"Spartina\" are currently two of the most damaging species. In response to such trends, ocean species have migrated to places they shouldn't. The Puget Sound has the most introduced invasive species. Nationwide, about 400 of the 958 (42 percent) species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA are considered to be at risk, primarily due to competition with and predation by non-native species.\n\nThe WDFW is now attempting to combat its exotic species problem with the Washington State Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan. Under this plan, Washington State Patrol Commercial Vehicle Inspectors search incoming vessels for harmful invasive species, such as the zebra mussel, and decontaminate the vessels before they can spread the organism.\n\nThe city of Olympia, Washington has worked with the United States Environmental Protection Agency to use the shells of invasive water snail which has started to decrease the numbers of the endemic Olympia Oyster. The invasive arched slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata) shell is taken and, packed into the sidewalk. With doing so, the shells of the said invasive species of water snail will slow down the runoff and will reduce the flow of stormwater which will in turn reduce flooding and potential environmental damage. Walker says that \"The scoop-shaped shell of the snail could help slow storm water. Currently the city uses rock and gravel beneath sidewalks to stabilize the concrete. City officials want to try using snail shells instead.\" The millions of snail shells could act as micro-reservoirs slowing the flow of stormwater and reducing the chances of city streams, brooks, and waterways. Emmett Dobey, the program manager at Olympia’s Department of Public Works says, \"The process also seemed to reduce the amount of pollutants that typically come along for the ride\".\n\nSince 1989, there have been 225 oil spills in Puget Sound. Nearly every day Puget Sound imports 550,000 barrels of unrefined oil, thus making Puget Sound one of the country's primary centers for refining petroleum. One such spill on October 14, 2004 in Dalco Passage leaked nearly 1,000 gallons over Vashon and Maury Islands.\n\nThe Washington state government has adapted the federal government's Marine Protected Area (MPA) system into designated Aquatic Reserves, defined as \"aquatic lands of special educational or scientific interest or lands of special environmental importance that are threatened by degradation\". Aquatic Reserves are meant to serve as aquatic versions of national parks or sanctuaries. Through the Aquatic Reserve Program, the DNR hopes to control these areas in an effort to restore, preserve or enhance habitats and species that directly tie into the aquatic ecosystem. The first Aquatic Reserve created under the program was at Maury Island in November 2004. Further candidate sites under review include Cherry Point, Fidalgo Bay and Cypress Island.\n\nPuget Sound Partnership reports that the Washington State Legislature included several priority items in the 2010 Supplemental Budget which are intended to support restorative efforts of the environment.\n\nThis includes funding totaling $50 million for Washington State Department of Ecology stormwater project funding. \"Stormwater is a primary source of toxic chemicals and other hazardous materials washing into Puget Sound and other water bodies\" .\nThere is also $42 million allocated to projects targeting toxic site cleanup in the Puget Sound.\n\nThe specifics of this legislature are as follows:\n\n\nPollution advisories are posted for some of the beach areas on the Puget Sound. These advisories warn the public of health concerns due to contact with sand and water of the posted areas. Showering after contact with material from these areas is advised. It is also advised to avoid eating fish and shell fish from these areas.\n\n\n"}

Hoke Smith\n\nMichael Hoke Smith (September 2, 1855November 27, 1931) was an American attorney, politician, and newspaper owner who served as United States Secretary of the Interior (1893–1896), 58th Governor of Georgia (1907–1909, 1911), and a United States Senator (1911–1920) from Georgia.\n\nSmith was born in Newton, North Carolina on September 2, 1855 to Hildreth H. Smith, president of Catawba College, and Mary Brent Hoke. When Smith was 2 years old, his father accepted a position on the faculty of the University of North Carolina, and moved the family to Chapel Hill. Smith attended Pleasant Retreat Academy and was primarily educated by his father. Smith was too young to participate in the Civil War, but his uncle was Civil War General Robert Hoke. In 1868, when the elder Smith lost his position at the University, he moved the family to Atlanta, Georgia, the city that would remain the younger Smith's home for the rest of his life. Smith did not attend law school, but read for the law in association with an Atlanta law firm. He passed the bar examination in 1873, at age seventeen, and became a lawyer in Atlanta.\n\nSmith maintained a small office in the James building downtown. His practice began to grow when he began to argue injury suits. As his practice grew, he brought in his brother Burton in 1882, also excellent in front of juries, and they worked together for over 10 years. Their main clients were the many railroad workers injured on the job; three-quarters of the cases they took involved personal injury and they won the bulk of them.\n\nSmith served as chairman of the Fulton County and State Democratic Conventions and was president of the Atlanta Board of Education. In 1887, Smith bought the \"Atlanta Journal\". His strong support in the \"Journal\" for Grover Cleveland during the 1892 Presidential election garnered Cleveland's attention and led to a federal job.\n\nSmith was appointed as Secretary of the Interior by Cleveland in 1893. He worked hard to right land patents previously obtained by the railroads, for rationalization of Indian affairs and for the economic development of the South. A staunch defender of Cleveland and his sound money policy, Smith campaigned throughout the country in 1896 for Cleveland candidates. When William Jennings Bryan was selected at the 1896 Democratic National Convention, Smith was in a quandary: could he support the party without supporting the platform? The overwhelming support for silver and Bryan in his home state of Georgia convinced him to try to have it both ways. His newspaper, the \"Journal\", endorsed the candidate but continued to denounce the silver policy. Smith resigned his cabinet post to protect Cleveland.\n\nSmith returned to Atlanta and resumed his lucrative law practice netting around $25,000 per year and slowly rebuilt his local reputation. In April 1900 he sold his interests in the \"Journal\" and tried many other investments but the only ones that did well were real estate in the Atlanta area. He was instrumental in organizing the North Avenue Presbyterian Church (which still stands) and was re-elected to the Atlanta Board of Education.\n\nSmith allied himself with Bryan's Vice Presidential candidate, Populist Tom Watson, one of Georgia's most influential politicians. With Watson's support, Smith was elected governor in 1907. In order to gain Watson's support, however, he had to call the Negro vote \"ignorant [and] purchasable.\" Smith established several Jim Crow laws requiring literacy tests and property ownership for voting; \"Smith kept his promise to Watson by leading the adoption of a constitutional amendment to impose a grandfather clause that effectively disenfranchised black Georgians.\" Smith also supported railroad reform and election reform. After losing the support of Watson, he was defeated in the next election by Joseph M. Brown. Smith was re-elected as governor in 1911.\n\nIn 1911 while still governor, he was chosen by the Georgia General Assembly to fill out the term of United States Senator Alexander S. Clay. Smith won re-election in 1914, but was defeated by Tom Watson in 1920. Afterward, Smith practiced law in Washington, DC, and Atlanta.\n\nMichael Hoke Smith died in 1931 and is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, the last surviving member of the Cleveland Cabinet.\n\nSmith was a maternal great-uncle of the Louisiana politician Frank Burton Ellis of New Orleans. Hoke Smith High School (1947–1985) once stood at 535 Hill Street SE, in Atlanta. During World War II, a Liberty ship was named the \"SS Hoke Smith\". The Hoke Smith Annex Building on the campus of the University of Georgia was named in honor of the late senator.\n\n"}

The Survey of Activities of Young People (SAYP) undertaken in 1999 indicated that collecting fuel or fetching water are by far the most common work-related activity done by children in South Africa. South African stakeholders have indicated, in the consultative process that led to the Child Labour Programme of Action, that the fetching of water over long distances should be regarded as a priority, given its prevalence and associated hazards.\n\nAccording to the Child Labour Programme of Action, this work should not be seen as child labour, a term which implies that someone benefits unduly from the work that children do. Poor households have little control over the distance to water from the homestead, and often have no alternative but to ask their children to help in carrying water. Therefore, stakeholders in the country indicated that fetching water should rather be seen as a priority form of child work that should be addressed by the government's programme to deliver water to all households by 2008.\n\nBy delivering water to such households, the extremely long periods spent by some children in collecting water could be reduced, thereby making more time available for schooling and other activities. It should also reduce the hazards they are exposed to.\n\nAccordingly, the Programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour (TECL), a programme to kickstart action on the Child Labour Programme of Action, commissioned Dynacon Engineering and the Human Sciences Research Council to do research and design pilot projects with a focus on water delivery in distant areas. The purpose of the overall project is to investigate the phenomenon, to design and run pilot projects, and to develop and implement policy to assist in water delivery in such areas. \n\nThis project was run in the following stages:\n\nThe research and design stage of this pilot includes three processes:\n\nIt is planned that the pilot project will run in two of the sites where the baseline study is being conducted, from about August 2005.\n\nPolicy will be developed during the pilot design and implementation stages.

In 1923 they with the Cowley cars were 28.1 per cent of British private car production. In 1925 Morris sold near double the number and they represented 41 per cent of British production. Meanwhile, Oxfords grew larger from the first 1018 cc, Nine horsepower, two-seater car to the last 2½-litre Twenty horsepower car.\n\nThe model name was recycled in 1948 and lasted almost another 23 years through to 1971 but in this time the market sector and engine-size remained nearly constant between 1476 cc and 1622 cc.\n\nWilliam Morris's first car was called Oxford in recognition of its home city. It was announced in \"The Autocar\" magazine in October 1912 and production began in March 1913. Virtually all components were bought-in and assembled by Morris. It was a small car with a 1018 cc four-cylinder side-valve engine with fixed cylinder head from White & Poppe.\n\nThe car got its popular name, Bullnose, from its distinctive round-topped radiator at first called the bullet nose. Most bodies were of the two-seat open-tourer type, there was also a van version, but the chassis did not allow four-seat bodies to be fitted, it was not strong enough and too short.\n\nIt was first displayed at the Olympia Motor Show which opened 7 November 1913. The standard model remained in production unchanged. The new de luxe had a longer wheelbase, , and track was now . The range of bodies was now expanded from the simple two-seater. Its front axle and steering had been re-designed to reduce \"bump-steer\"and its radiator capacity increased.\n\nThe American engined Continental Cowley, with most other significant components US sourced, shown to the press in April 1915, was a 50 percent larger engined (1495 cc against 1018 cc), longer, wider and better equipped version of this Morris Oxford with the same \"Bullnose\" radiator.\n\nThe Cowley's stronger and larger construction could carry a four-passenger body.\nThe 1919 Oxford (advertised as early as September 1918) was assembled from locally made components and now took on the rather more substantial aspect of 1915's Cowley. Longer and stronger than the old Oxford, enough to carry five passengers, the new Oxford retained the pre-war Bullnose radiator style in its larger version. From August 1919, the Cowley became the downmarket \"no frills\" variant with only a 2-seater body and lighter smaller tyres. The new car's 11.9 fiscal horsepower 1548 cc engine was made under licence in Coventry for Morris by a British branch of Hotchkiss the French ordnance company.\n\nIn 1923 the engine was enlarged to 13.9 fiscal horsepower, 1802 cc. This became known as the 14/28 engine. In 1925 it got a longer wheelbase chassis to move it further from the Cowley, and four-wheel brakes. This model of the Oxford would be the basis of the first MG, the 14/28 Super Sports.\n\n1926 mid-year switch to \"flatnose\"\nA short-lived 17 hp six-cylinder variant, The F-Type Oxford Six, was displayed for the first time as a four seated cabriolet at the November 1922 Olympia Motor Show. The first open four-seater tourer was sold to Lord Redesdale. Only 50 were made and, after the initial run, they were assembled to special order. It remained available until 1926. The 2320 cc engine proved unreliable, two intense vibration periods weakened and broke crankshafts and few were sold. \nThe distinctive bullnose radiator was dropped in 1926 in an updated version of the car. The engines remained the same but a new range of bodies was offered including all-steel saloons. There were substantial changes to the chassis frame which was now firmly fixed to the bulkhead or scuttle. The radiator cooling surface was increased sixty per cent\nThe 2½-litre Oxford 15.9 Empire model was displayed as \"a Colonial Chassis\" at the Olympia Motor Show of October 1926. The standard coachwork is a four or five seater body with four doors.\n\nThe car can be driven safely through 20 inches, 510 mm, of water. The ground clearance is 10¼ inches, 260 mm. A full 11 inches, 278 mm, is allowed at the forward running board bracket cross stay. This clearance is now greater than on many American cars. This \"falsifies hostile propaganda to the contrary\".\nThis Oxford 15.9 was replaced by another four cylinder Oxford, Oxford 16/40.\nA revised version of the slow-selling 4-cylinder 15.9 it was announced in September 1928. It was probably given this new name before the announcement of the 15.9 horsepower Oxford Six. There were minor improvements of appearance but this was no more than a 15.9 with a new name.\n\nThis 16/40 was replaced by Oxford Six 15.9 hp.\nA 1938 cc six-cylinder version, the LA series Oxford Six, was made between 1929 and 1933. It was much more successful than the 1920 version. The all-steel body was made over the road at Cowley by W R Morris's joint venture with American Edward G Budd, Pressed Steel Company. It had striking similarities to a recent Dodge body. By 1930 supply problems were such that it was replaced by a similar but coachbuilt (wood framed) body.\n\nIn August 1930 a shorter chassis more expensive version was announced and named Morris Major Six,\n\nFor other Morris Sixes: \n\nIn September 1932, the gearbox gained a fourth speed and the engine grew to 2062 cc with the Q-series unit.\n\nDirection indicators, a set of three coloured lights on each side of the car visible from front and rear were fitted. Controlled from a switch on the dashboard they permitted accurate indications of planned movements while the car's windows remain shut.\n\nThe Oxford, Isis and Twenty-five were singled out and given \"automatic clutch control\" described by \"The Times\" as automatism. The Oxford also received a governable free-wheel, bigger seats, a spare wheel cover and concealed ashtrays for back seat passengers. The chassis frame was quite new and now also contained a cruciform shape.\n\nThis Oxford Six was renamed Oxford Sixteen in September 1934 and placed within the new 16 to 25 horsepower range of Morris Big Sixes expanded in view of the 25 per cent reduction in Horse Power tax expected in 1935.\nThe Six name was changed to Sixteen, from the car's 16 hp tax horsepower category, in September 1934 when its 2062 cc engine was joined by the 2561 cc Twenty sold for the same price, the size of engine being the only difference. There was an intermediate eighteen horsepower Isis. Two styles of coachwork were available, the saloon and a Special coupé both fitted with a Pytchley sliding head (sunroof) and the sliding head was wired for radio.\n\nBarely nine months later these cars were superseded by members of the Morris Big Six series II range: Sixteen or Eighteen and Twenty-one or Twenty Five announced 2 July 1935.\n\nThe Oxford name disappeared from new Morris cars until 1948.\nNuffield's Oxford Taxi was produced from 1947 to 1953\n\nAfter the Second World War the one much larger 13.5 fiscal horsepower Oxford Series MO replaced the range of Ten horsepower series M, Morris's Twelve and Morris's Fourteen. It was announced along with the new 918 cc Morris Minor and the 2.2-litre Morris Six MS on 26 October 1948. Designed by Alec Issigonis, the Oxford, along with the Minor, introduced unit construction techniques, although it is not widely recognized as a true unibody car. The MO was sold as a 4-door saloon and 2-door \"Traveller\" estate with an exposed wooden frame at the rear. Both were four-seaters. A six-cylinder version was sold as the Morris Six MS. It was replaced by the Oxford Series II announced Tuesday 18 May 1954.\n\nThe extensively redesigned Oxford announced in May 1954 was given a new shape directly foreshadowing the BMC ADO17 and, following the formation of BMC, notably getting the Austin-designed B-Series OHV straight-4. Styling was entirely new though the rounded body maintained a family resemblance to the Morris Minor. Sales remained strong when the Series III arrived in 1956.\n\nA 2.6-litre six-cylinder 7-inches longer Morris Isis version was announced 12 July 1955 with a saloon or \"Traveller\" estate body.\n\nHindustan Motors of India produced the four-cylinder version of this car (except the air-vent situated upon the bonnet) naming it Hindustan Landmaster.\n\nThe Oxford was updated for 1957 with a new fluted bonnet and small rear fins and an optional two-tone paint scheme all announced on 18 October 1956. A semi-automatic, two pedal, \"Manumatic\" transmission with centrifugal clutch with vacuum operation coupled to gear changes was optional. The woody Series III Traveller was replaced by the Series IV in 1957, though the saloon remained in production until the Pininfarina-styled Series V was introduced in 1959. 58,117 Series III and Series IV Oxfords were built.\nThe Oxford IV was only made in the Traveller estate version. A steel-bodied replacement for the \"woody\" Series III Traveller, it was similar to the Series III saloon in most respects. The IV was introduced in 1957.\n\nA Traveller estate car version of the Series V Farina body was announced 28 September 1960. The new body now provided a double bed size sleeping compartment about 6 ft long and 4 ft wide. The back of the car had a tail-board hinged at the bottom and an upper panel hinged at the top. The Morris version had a single bench front seat and cost £10 more than the equivalent Austin Countryman.\nFor 1959, the Oxford, announced on Lady Day 25 March 1959, was merged into the mid-sized Pininfarina-designed BMC Farina range along with a half-dozen other previously announced models, including the 1958 Wolseley 15/60 and 1959 Riley 4/68, Austin A55 Cambridge Mark II, and MG Magnette Mark III. The Series IV Traveller was still sold for the first year after which a Series V Traveller was made.\n\nIn all, 87,432 Series V Oxfords were built.\nAll five Farina cars were updated in October 1961 with a new 1.6-litre (1622 cc/98 in) version of the B-Series engine, longer wheelbase and a new revised look. The tail fins had been trimmed and there were still detail changes between the marques. The Morris retained the Series V dash, while the Austin had an all-new fake woodgrain design. The Morris Oxford Traveller (estate) Series V was replaced by a Series VI, although little changed apart from the front grille.\n\nA diesel-engined Oxford Series VI, introduced shortly after the 1961 update, was popular as a taxi. Variants of the same diesel engine enjoyed a long life in marine applications.\n\nThe Oxford VI remained in production until 1971 with 208,823 produced. The Oxford range was to have been replaced by the 1967 Morris 1800 (a badge-engineered 1964 ADO17 Austin 1800), but in the event both were built in parallel until 1971 because in terms both of pricing and of interior space the 1800 fell into the market segment of a slightly larger car. The ADO17 1800 continued until 1975, when it was succeeded by the ADO71 Morris 1800. The car which took the Oxford's place at the smaller end of the market segment was the Morris Marina, which also succeeded the yet smaller Minor.\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

The elder Johnston brought his family to Flagstaff, Arizona, on September 16, 1896, to serve Navajos residing on the western part of the Navajo Reservation. Philip's father was able to intervene and defuse a potentially violent clash known as the Padre Canyon Incident, which revealed underlying tensions between Navajos and Anglos involving livestock rustling. For resolving that incident in a peaceful manner, local Navajo leaders allowed Reverend Johnston to build a mission 12 miles north of Leupp, Arizona. After that incident, Philip's father worked to expand the boundaries of the western part of the Navajo reservation in order to resolve livestock rustling disputes on which developing tensions were generally centered.\n\nOn the reservation, young Philip learned to speak Navajo while playing with Navajo children. In 1901, Philip traveled to Washington, D.C., with his father and local Navajo leaders when they spoke to the newly appointed President Theodore Roosevelt to persuade him to add more land to the Navajo Reservation via an Executive Order. Philip was the Navajo/English translator between the local Navajo leaders and President Roosevelt.\n\nAround 1909–10, Johnston attended the Northern Arizona Normal School, now Northern Arizona University, where he earned an academic degree. In March 1918 he enlisted in the U.S. Army's 319th Engineers, where he received a reserve commission. Between March and September 1918 he trained in Camp Fremont at Menlo Park, California, before being shipped to France as part of the AEF to participate in World War I. It is here that he may have heard about Comanches being used as code talkers by U.S. Army units.\n\nJohnston attended the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where he earned his graduate civil engineering degree in 1925. Afterwards he took a job with the city of Los Angeles water department.\n\nThough he worked in Los Angeles he maintained his social connections with the Navajo people with whom he grew up. He was working as a civilian in Los Angeles when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor. After the attack he had read of the U.S. Army using Comanches in their Louisiana field maneuvers to transmit military communications and began to think that the Navajo language could also be applied in this manner. He presented this idea to the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and he was directed to present his proposal.\n\nJohnston recruited four Navajos who were working in the Los Angeles shipyards, and arranged to demonstrate the utility of using the Navajo language to transmit military communications. The officer in charge of this demonstration was Communications Officer, Amphibious Force, Fleet Marine Force (FMF) Major James E. Jones, USMC at Camp Elliot, San Diego and Commanding Officer; Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet General Clayton Barney Vogel heard of the event and attended the demonstration. Initially Philip thought the Navajo language could be used unmodified to transmit military communications, using conversational Navajo. Just before the actual demonstration started, the Navajos received their samples of common military expressions they were to convey to each other. They informed the gathered personnel that in order to send the military messages they would have to use word and letter substitution methods to convey the messages. After some deliberation to agree upon which Navajo words would represent English equivalents the Navajos were divided into two groups and put into separate rooms, where field phones had been installed, at opposite ends of the same building.\n\nAt that point they transmitted the common military expressions they were assigned to be coded into Navajo and decoded into English, by verbally encrypting, transmitting and decoding the messages nearly verbatim from English, to Navajo and back into English. Philip indicated that this Camp Elliot exercise revealed limitations to using conversational Navajo for military communications and that he was inspired to use the letter and word substitution methods to encrypt Navajo. On the other hand, USMC documents indicate that it was after this demonstration, when they were independently investigating the logistics of using the Navajo language as a code, that it was Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel who stated that a coding system for Navajo had to be created.\n\nGeneral Vogel was so impressed with the Camp Elliot demonstration that he asked the Commandant of the Marine Corps to recruit 200 Navajos. But Vogel was given authorization to recruit only 30 Navajos, under a pilot program status to investigate the feasibility of this proposed program with actual Navajos. On the morning of May 4, 1942, 29 Navajo recruits boarded the bus at Ft. Defiance, Arizona, were transported to the induction center at Ft. Wingate, New Mexico, and, after lunch, were transported overnight to Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego (MCRD, SD) for administrative in-processing, then to start their seven weeks of standard recruit training. Upon completion of recruit training the first all-Navajo Platoon 382 graduated from MCRD, SD on June 27, 1942, where they were immediately ordered to report to Camp Elliot for about eight weeks of basic communications training and to develop a code based on the Navajo language. As for developing the code, the Navajos were guided by a cryptographic officer under the command of now Lieutenant Colonel Jones in the basics of employing letter and word substitution encryption methods in the formulation of the code. Shortly after the beginning of this project three additional Navajo Marines were added to the program, and together the 32 Navajos worked to develop the code. Their stay in Camp Elliot ended in the latter half of August 1942.\n\nBased upon the successful training of the pilot talker program on August 25, 1942, the authorization to fulfill the recruitment of 200 Navajos commenced and Marine units \"were asked to submit recommendations relative to the number of Navajos they could usefully employ\".\n\nAfter training, one group of 50 were assigned to the 1st Marine Division, a second group of 16 were assigned to the 6th Marines and the 2nd Signal Company of the 2nd Marine Division. Three individuals were retained stateside to recruit and train Navajos to become code talkers. The first group of Navajo code talkers arrived at Guadalcanal on September 18, 1942, near Lunga Point. The second group arrived with the 6th Marines on January 4, 1943, and relieved the 1st Marine Division code talkers and then participated in the latter stages of the Battle of Guadalcanal.\n\nAfter the USMC officially instituted the \"talker\" program, Johnston asked the USMC for a special dispensation to serve in the Navajo Code Talking Program as a Staff Sergeant. His request was granted on September 22, 1942, and he served as a school administrator for the \"confidential\" program. By October 26, 1942, Staff Sergeant Philip Johnston USMCR and Corporal John A. Benally USMC, one of the three stateside code talkers, were sent out to recruit more Navajos to join the program. From late October through November 1942, they recruited Navajos throughout the western portion of the reservation, until they were recalled back to Camp Elliot. On December 7, 1942, the Navajo Communication School at Camp Elliot began formal lessons under Johnston's supervision. Navajo recruits trickled in and went through standard Marine Corps boot camp, whereupon after graduation they were sent to Camp Elliot. The next all-Navajo platoon to go through boot camp was Platoon 297 in March 1943 at MCRD, SD.\n\nJohnston may have proposed the idea of using the Navajo language to encrypt USMC tactical communications, but he was not yet on active duty with the USMC to be present during its creation by the first 29 + 3 Navajos who created the vocabulary with guidance by a USMC cryptographic officer.\n\nPhilip Johnston died on September 11, 1978, at the VA Hospital in San Diego, California. He is buried at Glendale, California.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900483", "title": "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377", "text": "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 377 A, the \"Uniting for Peace\" resolution, states that in any cases where the Security Council, because of a lack of unanimity among its five permanent members (P5), fails to act as required to maintain international peace and security, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately and may issue appropriate recommendations to UN members for collective measures, including the use of armed force when necessary, in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.\n\nThe resolution—also known as the \"Acheson Plan\"— was designed to provide the UN with an alternative avenue for action when at least one P5 member is using its veto to obstruct the Security Council from carrying out its functions mandated by the UN Charter. However, it may have overstated the Charter authority of the General Assembly by placing it in a superior position relative to the Security Council, which maintains primary responsibility for international peace and security. This issue is potentially addressed by limiting the power to invoke the resolution to the Council itself, which may in appropriate cases refer a stalled matter to the Assembly via procedural vote (which is not subject to the veto). In practice, a Council referral has been employed in the majority of cases.\n\nTo facilitate prompt action by the General Assembly in the case of a deadlocked Security Council, the resolution created the mechanism of the \"emergency special session\" (ESS). Emergency special sessions have been convened under this procedure on ten occasions, with the most recent convened in 1997. However, unlike preceding ESSs, the tenth ESS has been 'adjourned' and 'resumed' on numerous occasions, over the past several years, and remains adjourned. Indeed, more than ten separate 'meetings' have been held by the Assembly, whilst sitting in tenth ESS, since 2000.\n\n \"\"Reaffirming\" the importance of the exercise by the Security Council of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and the duty of the permanent members to seek unanimity and to exercise restraint in the use of the veto, ...\n\nThe Uniting for Peace resolution was initiated by the United States, and submitted by the \"Joint Seven-Powers\" in October 1950, as a means of circumventing further Soviet vetoes during the course of the Korean War (25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953). It was adopted by 52 votes to 5, with 2 abstentions.\n\nIn the closing days of Assembly discussions leading up to the adoption of 377 A, US delegate to the UN, John Foster Dulles, made specific reference to the Korean War as a chief motivator in the passage of the resolution:\nThen came the armed attack on the Republic of Korea and it seemed that the pattern of 1931 had in fact begun to repeat itself and that the third world war might be in the making. And that might have been—and I think it would have been—had it not been for a series of accidental circumstances which made it possible to improvise collective resistance to that aggression.\nThe principal accidental circumstance referred to by Dulles was that the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time of the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, and had been since January 1950, owing to its discontent over the UN's refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China's representatives as the legitimate representatives of China, returning only on 1 August 1950 to assume the rotating role of Council President, for that month. This circumstance had meant that the Security Council was able to adopt its resolutions 83, of 27 June 1950, and 84, of 7 July 1950, thereby establishing a UN-mandated force for South Korea \"to repel the armed attack\" from the North. Had the Soviet Union been seated at the Council during the months of June and July, the relevant draft resolutions would almost certainly have been vetoed, and the United States was well aware of this, as evidenced by the above statement.\n\nSome of the key statements made during Assembly discussions on 377 A, whilst sitting in plenary, include:\n\n\"If, in response to our resolution, the Member States do actually establish a system which ensures that aggression will be promptly exposed, if they maintain a collective strength, and if they have both the will and the way to use that strength promptly in case of need, then a third world war may be permanently averted... It would be vastly reassuring to all who love peace if here we could adopt unanimously a programme which only aggressors need fear.\" ...\n\n\"We must organize dependably the collective will to resist. If the Security Council does not do so, then this Assembly must do what it can by invoking its residual power of recommendation... As the world moves in the path that this resolution defines, it will move nearer and nearer to the Charter ideal\".\n\"The Soviet Union ... has attributed to the Council a power which it has never had under the Charter, namely, the power to insist that, because the Council has itself been reduced to impotence in the face of aggression by disagreement among its permanent members, the entire world Organisation shall wash its hands of the whole matter and let aggression take its course. The Council has never possessed any such right. Indeed, it is impossible to conceive that the authors of the Charter at San Francisco would have lent themselves to a proposition so far out of tune with the hopes and wishes of the peoples of the world.\" ...\n\n\"This resolution should help to make aggression less likely by giving notice to any intending aggressor that he risks uniting the world against him... All the peace-loving nations must welcome the strengthening of the forces of peace which the passing of these resolutions will represent.\"\n\"France supports the Charter—the whole Charter... Where peace and security are at stake, France considers that the General Assembly and the Security Council should assume all the responsibilities laid upon them by the Charter... It is unthinkable that this entire machinery, designed to safeguard the peace and security of the world, should remain inactive when there is a threat to peace and security. And if ... there is a real danger of such inactivity, then we must revise our customs, our methods, our rules and our interpretations\". ...\n\n\"My delegation felt ... that it was unnecessary to revise the Charter, which itself afforded the means of ensuring that its principles should be applied... The draft resolution does not infringe upon the Security Council’s competence, responsibilities or powers. The Council should fulfil its role; if it does so it will be adequate... If, however, for some reason, it does not fulfil its role, the United Nations will not thereby be paralysed. A [emergency] special session of the General Assembly can be convened within twenty-four hours and the Assembly ... can discuss and adopt any recommendations which appear necessary for the maintenance or re-establishment of peace and security.\"\n\"The organizers of the Anglo-American bloc, in their inflammatory speeches against the USSR ... yesterday and today, tried to create the impression that they wanted to organize a check against any possible aggressor... As if our troops were waging war in every country! As if we had surrounded the world with a fiery ring of naval, air and other bases! As if we were conducting a furious armaments race, daily spending more and more thousands of millions which the taxpayer, the ordinary American people, have to provide! As if we really did not want to outlaw the atomic bomb! Yet this draft resolution does not even refer to the necessity of ensuring that the atomic bomb is outlawed!... We must now have been seeking for some five years to ensure that a decision to outlaw the atomic bomb—the use of the atomic bomb—is taken\". ...\n\n\"We base our arguments on the fundamental provision laid down in Article 10 of the Charter, namely, that the General Assembly may discuss and make recommendations on any matters relating to the powers and functions of any organs of the United Nations — and consequently of an organ such as the Security Council — except as otherwise provided. But two exceptions are provided. The first, which applies to all matters, is to be found in Article 12, paragraph 1, which says that when the Security Council is considering these questions or exercising its functions in respect thereof, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation... The other exception is in the last sentence of Article 11, paragraph 2, which says that if a question which may be considered by the General Assembly calls for enforcement action ... then it must necessarily be referred to the Security Council... But there is a basic reservation... It is that ... the General Assembly may decide, what measures \"not involving the use of force\" are to be employed. Severance of diplomatic relations is a measure not involving the use of armed force. Interruption of economic relations is an enforcement measure not involving the use of armed force.\"\nThe Uniting for Peace resolution was implemented 12 times between 1951 and 1997. It has been invoked by both the Security Council (7 times) and the General Assembly (5 times). Ten of those cases took the form of Emergency Special Sessions.\n\nInvoked by Security Council Resolution 119. Although \"Uniting for Peace\" was enacted because of Soviet vetoes, its first use was, unexpectedly, against two NATO members. The Assembly's first emergency special session was instigated by a procedural vote of the Security Council on its Resolution 119 of 31 October 1956, as a result of the Suez Crisis, which commenced 29 October 1956. France and the United Kingdom were the only two Council members to vote against the adoption of Council resolution 119, and were likewise, along with Israel, the principal antagonists in the conflict with Egypt; a conflict that the United States wanted to end. The session's meetings were held between 1 November and 10 November 1956.\n\nOn 7 November 1956, the Assembly adopted resolution 1001, thereby establishing the United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I) to \"secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities\". The Assembly, by its own resolutions, not only established UNEF I, but also called for \"an immediate cease-fire\", and recommended \"that all Member States refrain from introducing military goods in the area\", thereby authorizing military sanctions.\n\nInvoked by Security Council Resolution 120. Second UNGA Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in Hungary” adopted five resolutions, including Resolution 1004 (ES-II) mandating a commission of inquiry into foreign intervention in Hungary.\n\nInvoked by Security Council Resolution 129.

Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded 'final responsibility'—rather than 'secondary responsibility'—for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter.

It was to be a stepping stone for Empire of Japan's final control of the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe operation started in spring of 1942, after the first phase of operations had been concluded in south China, and continued through spring of 1943. The operation is noted for Japan's sustained bombing of cities in central west China.\n\nThe basic plan was to make a multi-front breakthrough to Sichuan from northern Shanxi, central Hubei and southern Hunan. Heavy aerial support and bombing of Chongqing was to support the advance of the Japanese Army and their Collaborationist Chinese Army puppets. Japanese Navy patrol boats from the Yangtze river were to provide further bombardment. Chiang Kai-shek discussed the invasion in his book \"Soviet Russia in China\", stating:\nThe Imperial General Headquarters sent the order for drawing down 16 divisions and logistics support units from Japan reserves, Manchukuo and Southern Areas (including New Guinea and Solomon islands also) to reinforce the Japanese expeditionary forces in central China area, to prepare the principal force of ten divisions in south Shanshi and other support group conformed by six Divisions of Ichang in Hubei amongst other Divisions located in Changde, in Hunan, for striking Sichuan and the occupation of Chongqing in September 1942.\n\nBy coincidence, September 1942 was also the time when the German Wehrmacht was closing in on Stalingrad. The invasion phase was to involve Japanese units first occupying Wanxian, from where the Japanese could advance to Chongqing-proper in echelon. To cut off the escape routes of Chinese refugees, the occupation of North Guizhou was planned, which could be used to stage an attack on Chengdu through Yibin.\n\nThe north Japanese army division would have had the option to either advance towards south Shaanxi to capture Xi'an, or towards Hanzhong to take Chengdu directly. Alternatively, Japan could have utilized airborne forces to cut off Chinese escape routes and take the Chongqing metropolitan area directly.\n\nBoth Chiang Kai-shek and General Wego W.K. Chiang suspected that the intense bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Air Force was to support the diversionary Japanese operations against metropolitan Chongqing, as part of the invasion of Sichuan. It was also possible that the Japanese army hoped that a terror campaign against Chongqing would force the Chinese authorities to break from the Allies and make a separate peace with Japan.\n\nAccording to General Chiang Wei-kuo, should the invasion be successful, the Japanese might have intended to put Wang Jingwei's puppet regime in charge of Chongqing. The Japanese might also have persuaded Chiang Kai-shek to join Japan's Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere and to even assist in a future Japanese offensive against the Soviet Union in Siberia and Central Asia. Another possibility was the installation of a Japanese civilian or military Governor-General to administer the area as an Imperial Japanese Army fief in mainland Asia, which could later be expanded to include Tibet and Xinjiang as well.\n\nDue to opposition against Japan from other Allied countries, the Sichuan invasion was not enthusiastically carried out. In particular, the United States' counter-offensive against Japan heavily undermined the possibility of an invasion. Chiang Kai-shek stated:\nBut in June 1942, Japanese forces suffered the humiliating defeat in the Battle of Midway, and in August the U.S. forces initiated the counteroffensive against the Solomon Islands, with a landing at Tenaru River, Guadalcanal (Operation Watchtower). The Japanese suffered frequent losses at the end of September 1942, and decided to delay the implement of invasion plan for Sichuan. Later in November, the Japanese forces having been totally defeated in Guadalcanal, (Battle of Guadalcanal, Battle of Tassafaronga and Battle of Rennel), the situation was turned around, with Japan losing all possibility to transfer with impunity its forces in the area (the Japanese were obliged to use all disposable vessels in their retreat, \"Operation KE\" during the night of February 1–2, 1943, the last part of the so-called \"Tokyo Express\"). At the end of 1942, the planning for the Sichuan Invasion was suspended.\n\nHowever, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters was still in favor of an invasion. Hence the Japanese China Expeditionary Army produced a new plan for the capture of Sichuan, which was based on the previous 1942 plan. The May 1943 \"Battle of West Hubei\" was part of this new attempt to advance to Sichuan.\n\nNevertheless, by then the Nationalist Chinese armies had the support of the \"Flying Tigers\" (A.V.G.) of the United States, which was commanded by General Claire Chennault. In subsequent battles, the Japanese army suffered defeats at the hands of the Nationalist Chinese armies. In light of these defeats, the Japanese forces had to abandon a new offensive. During this period the Chinese Army sent seven Army envoys to Yunnan and India to clear the China–Burma route.\n\nIn fear of Chinese reinforcements through the cleared route and having sustained much losses in the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army switched their attention to Yunnan to prevent future Chinese counter-offensives from that area.\n\n\n"}

It is located 4.7 km east of the Green Line and falls under the jurisdiction of Gush Etzion Regional Council. In , Kfar Etzion had a population of .\n\nThe majority of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli and the American governments dispute this.\n\nIn January 1927, the Zikhron David society, a group of 160 Orthodox Jews from the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem, established a small farming community, \"Migdal Eder,\" on land south of Jerusalem. The name was taken from a verse in the Bible, Genesis 35:21, which referenced a tower by the same name. During the 1929 Palestine riots, Migdal Eder was attacked and destroyed. Residents of the neighboring Palestinian village of Beit Ummar sheltered the farmers, but they could not return to their land.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the land was purchased by Haredi businessman Shmuel Zvi Holtzman from Rehovot, who renamed the settlement \"Kfar Etzion,\" a play on his own name: Yiddish “holts” and German \"Holz\" means “wood”, which translates to “etz” in Hebrew). The Jews were forced to leave again in the wake of the 1936–39 Arab revolt. Much of what Holtzman and his comrades had built was demolished by the Arabs.\n\nIn 1943–47, the kibbutz movement sent out groups of settlers to establish four kibbutzim, creating what became known as the Etzion bloc. Kfar Etzion, Ein Tzurim, Massu'ot Yitzhak and Revadim were destroyed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and the entire area came under Jordanian rule.\n\nThe kibbutzim held off the attacks for ten days until Kfar Etzion fell. In the Kfar Etzion massacre on 14 May, 157 Jewish inhabitants of the village were murdered, as all but four of the inhabitants were executed by Arab Legion and irregular forces. The other three kibbutzim surrendered. The inhabitants there were taken as prisoners of war and released nine months later.\n\nIn 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six-Day War. The Israeli cabinet decided to re-establish the settlement of Kfar Etzion despite receiving legal advice that establishing such settlements in occupied territory would be illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. A key figure identified with Kfar Etzion's reestablishment after 1967 is Hanan Porat, who lived on the kibbutz as a child prior to its destruction in 1948.\n\nAnother figure involved in Kfar Etzion's resettlement is Elyashiv Knohl, a rabbi of the community whose father fought in Israel's War of Independence and was captured during the war by the Jordanians. According to Knohl, Kfar Etzion's original settlers were socialists, and members of the kibbutz continue to channel their incomes to a joint account. Today Kfar Etzion houses a museum and archive documenting the history of Gush Etzion.\n\nIn the 2013 Middle East cold snap a meter of snow fell on the Kfar Etzion area.\n\nResidents of Kfar Etzion earn their livelihood growing cherries, flowers, olives, almonds, and grapes. Some raise chickens, and others work in Jerusalem. As of 2012 there is a large clothing store on the settlement. In 2012 the price of a 120-square-meter home on the settlement was while the price of a 200-square-meter home was .\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the lead vocalist, lyricist, and guitarist of the rock band Interpol. He released a solo album called \"Julian Plenti is... Skyscraper\" in 2009 under the name Julian Plenti, though his solo material is now recorded under his real name. As a singer, his voice lies in the baritone range.\n\nBanks was born in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, on 3 May 1978. His family left England when Banks was three years old and moved to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. They then moved to Spain when he was around 12, and it was here that he studied at the American School of Madrid in Pozuelo de Alarcón before the family moved back to the U.S. to settle in New Jersey. His father was later transferred to Mexico, where Banks finished high school at the American School Foundation in Mexico City.\n\nBanks was involved in stage productions during his time at the American School Foundation, playing the lead role in the musical \"South Pacific\". As a result of his time in Mexico, he is fluent in Mexican Spanish and speaks the language with an accurately Mexican accent. He later attended New York University, where he studied English and comparative literature, and he worked at magazines such as \"Gotham\" and \"Interview\" after graduating. He later took a data entry job at the Scholastic Corporation and worked in a café in order to devote more of his time to music and rehearsals. He was inspired to become a musician by Nirvana.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Banks ran into fellow NYU undergrad Daniel Kessler, whom he had met previously on a study abroad program in Paris. Kessler then asked Paul Banks to join the band he had started with drummer Greg Drudy and bass guitarist Carlos Dengler. Banks was initially not inclined to join a band as he had been writing songs as a solo artist, but eventually joined Interpol as a guitarist and vocalist after listening to the type of music they were writing and playing.\n\nBanks' voice, singing style, and lyrics have been strongly compared to, most notably, Ian Curtis of Joy Division. Banks has said that he does not try to emulate his greatest influences because he thinks he cannot live up to them, saying \"I would never try to sing like Frank Black or Kurt Cobain because you just can't do it.\"\n\nBeginning with the recording Interpol's fifth album, \"El Pintor\", Banks has assumed bass duties. In the music video for the album's lead single \"All the Rage Back Home\", Banks can be seen playing a Fender Precision Bass.\n\nBanks released a solo album under the name Julian Plenti on 4 August 2009 entitled \"Julian Plenti Is... Skyscraper\". Banks claims to have multiple solo projects and monikers in mind. He released a five-song EP entitled \"Julian Plenti Lives...\" on 26 June 2012. His second full-length studio album, \"Banks\" was announced on 6 August 2012 and was released on 22 October 2012.\n\nIn addition to the full-length albums, Banks self-released a mixtape entitled \"Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be\" in 2013, which included contributions by Talib Kweli, El-P, High Prizm and Mike G.\n\nIn June 2016, Paul Banks and RZA announced a joint album \"Anything But Words\" as \"Banks and Steelz\", with guest appearances by Kool Keith, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Masta Killa and Florence Welch. Two singles were planned: \"Love + War\" and \"Giant\".\n\nOn 5 March 2020, Banks announced that he was forming a new band, Muzz, with Matt Barrick (of the Walkmen and Fleet Foxes) and Josh Kaufman of Bonny Light Horseman. The band also released their first single, \"Bad Feeling.\"\n\nDuring Interpol's early years, Banks typically played a black Les Paul Custom guitar. He then started using a Fender Jaguar (primarily due to the use of the tremolo in songs such as \"Pioneer to the Falls\") and a Gibson Flying V (which, for a time, had the word \"breasts\" spelled out in white tape on it) for songs from \"Our Love to Admire\", and used his Les Paul for songs from \"Antics\" and \"Turn on the Bright Lights\", although some songs like \"Obstacle 1\" were played with the Jaguar because of the impracticality of switching. Songs like \"Mammoth\" were recorded using his Les Paul for this same reason.\n\nBanks used his Jaguar as his primary guitar for the end leg of the \"Our Love to Admire\" tour, and was also seen using a Gibson ES-135 for songs such as \"Not Even Jail\", but since the 2010 tour leg he has not been since using the Jaguar or ES-135 and has only been seen using his traditional black Les Paul in live settings. His Flying V, with the white tape now removed, can be seen in the music video for \"Barricade\". His ES-135 was his primary guitar during his live performances as alter ego Julian Plenti. In the 2010s, during live performances of his solo work, he began playing a Dave Murray signature Fender Stratocaster with two humbucker pickups and a middle position single coil, possibly to avoid having to change guitars between songs for the diverse sounds on his solo records. In terms of bass guitars, he has been seen using a black Fender Precision Bass with a maple fretboard.\n\nAccording to one source, Banks has used effects pedals such as the BOSS TU-2, Z.Vex Super Duper 2 in 1, EHX Micro POG, MXR Micro Amp, MXR Bass Octave Deluxe, Way Huge Swollen Pickle, Ibanez TS9DX, BOSS DN-2, and 2 MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay (one set at higher repeats). His pedalboard on the Julian Plenti tour consisted of a BOSS TU-2, Way Huge Aqua-Puss, BOSS DN-2, EHX POG 2, Blackstar HT Dual Tube Distortion, and an MXR Carbon Copy. Since 2004, he has used two Fender Pro Reverb amplifiers.\n\nIn contrast to Interpol's melancholic indie rock sound, Banks has been a fan of hip hop since he was a child and has worked as a hip hop DJ under the pseudonym DJ Fancypants.\n\nIn October 2012, Danish supermodel Helena Christensen referred to Banks as her boyfriend. In July 2018, Banks confirmed that they had split up after a long-term relationship.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900542", "title": "Great Fire of 1910", "text": "Great Fire of 1910\n\nThe Great Fire of 1910 (also commonly referred to as the Big Blowup, the Big Burn, or the Devil's Broom fire) was a wildfire in the western United States that burned in North Idaho and Western Montana, with extensions into Eastern Washington and Southeast British Columbia, in the summer of 1910. The area burned included large parts of the Bitterroot, Cabinet, Clearwater, Coeur d'Alene, Flathead, Kaniksu, Kootenai, Lewis and Clark, Lolo, and St. Joe national forests.\n\nThe fire burned over two days on the weekend of August 20–21, after strong winds caused numerous smaller fires to combine into a firestorm of unprecedented size. It killed 87 people, mostly firefighters, destroyed numerous manmade structures, including several entire towns, and burned more than three million acres of forest with an estimated billion dollars' worth of timber lost. It is believed to be the largest, although not the deadliest, forest fire in U.S. history. The extensive burned area was approximately the size of the state of Connecticut.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, the U.S. Forest Service received considerable recognition for its firefighting efforts, including a doubling of its budget from Congress. The outcome was to highlight firefighters as public heroes while raising public awareness of national nature conservation. The fire is often considered a significant impetus in the development of early wildfire prevention and suppression strategies.\n\nA great number of problems contributed to the destruction caused by the Great Fire of 1910. The wildfire season started early that year because the winter of 1909–1910 and the spring and summer of 1910 were extremely dry, and the summer sufficiently hot to have been described as \"like no others.\" The drought resulted in forests that were teeming with dry fuel, which had previously grown up on abundant autumn and winter moisture. Hundreds of fires were ignited by hot cinders flung from locomotives, sparks, lightning, and backfiring crews. By mid-August, there were 1,000 to 3,000 fires burning in Idaho, Montana, and Washington.\n\nAugust 20 (Saturday) brought hurricane-force winds to the interior northwest, whipping the hundreds of small fires into one or two much larger blazing infernos. Such a conflagration was impossible to fight; there were too few men and supplies. The United States Forest Service (then called the National Forest Service) was only five years old at the time and unprepared for the possibilities of the dry summer or a fire of this magnitude, though all summer it had been urgently recruiting as many men as possible to fight the hundreds of fires already burning, many with little forestry or firefighting experience. Earlier in August President William Howard Taft had authorized the addition of military troops to the effort, and 4,000 troops, including seven companies from the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Regiment (known as the Buffalo Soldiers), were brought in to help fight the fires burning in the northern Rockies. The arrival of the Buffalo Soldiers troops almost doubled the black population of Idaho.\n\nSmoke from the fire was said to have been seen as far east as Watertown, New York, and as far south as Denver, Colorado. It was reported that at night, out into the Pacific Ocean, ships could not navigate by the stars because the sky was cloudy with smoke.\n\nThe extreme scorching heat of the sudden blowup can be attributed to the expansive Western white pine forests that covered much of northern Idaho at the time. Hydrocarbons in the trees' resinous sap boiled out and created a cloud of highly flammable gas that blanketed hundreds of square miles, which then spontaneously detonated dozens of times, each time sending tongues of flame thousands of feet into the sky and creating a rolling wave of fire that destroyed anything and everything in its path.\n\nAt least 78 firefighters were killed while trying to control the fire, not including those firefighters who died after the fire of smoke damage to their lungs. The entire 28-man \"Lost Crew\" was overcome by flames and perished on Setzer Creek outside of Avery, Idaho.\n\nPerhaps the most famous story of survival is that of Ranger Ed Pulaski, a U.S. Forest Service ranger who led a large crew of about 44 men to safety in an abandoned prospect mine outside of Wallace, Idaho, just as they were about to be overtaken by the fire. It is said that Pulaski fought off the flames at the mouth of the shaft until he passed out like the others. Around midnight, a man announced that he, at least, was getting out of there. Knowing that they would have no chance of survival if they ran, Pulaski drew his pistol, threatening to shoot the first person who tried to leave. In the end, all but five of the forty or so men survived. Pulaski has since been widely celebrated as a hero for his efforts; the mine tunnel in which he and his crew sheltered from the fire, now known as the Pulaski Tunnel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe fire was finally extinguished when another cold front swept in, bringing steady rain and some early snowfall. Several towns were completely destroyed by the \n\nIn Idaho, one third of the town of Wallace was burned to the ground, with an estimated $1 million in damage (). Passenger trains evacuated thousands of Wallace residents to Spokane and Missoula. Another train with 1,000 people from Avery took refuge in a tunnel after racing across a burning trestle. Other towns with severe damage included Burke, Kellogg, Murray, and Osburn, all in Idaho. The towns of Avery, Saltese (MT), as well as a major part of Wallace, were saved by backfires. The smoke from the fire went as far to the east as New York City, and as far south as Dallas.\n\nThe Great Fire of 1910 cemented and shaped the U.S. Forest Service, which at the time was a newly established department on the verge of cancellation, facing opposition from mining and forestry interests. Before the epic conflagration, there were many debates about the best way to handle forest fires—whether to let them burn because they were a part of nature and were expensive to fight, or to fight them in order to protect the forests.\n\nOne of the people who fought the fire, Ferdinand Silcox, went on to become the fifth chief of the fire service. Influenced by the devastation of the Big Blowup, Silcox promoted the \"10 a.m.\" policy, with the goal of suppressing all fires by 10 a.m. of the day following their report. It was decided that the Forest Service was to prevent and battle every wildfire. More recently, this absolutist attitude to wildfires has been criticized for altering the natural disturbance mechanisms that drive forest ecosystem structure, which paradoxically increases the destructive potential of forest fires.\n\n\n\n"}

Coral reefs are found in shallow, warm salt water. The sunlight filters through clear water and allows microscopic organisms to live and reproduce. The Indian Ocean holds 60% of the world's coastal reefs, 25% are in the Pacific and 15% are in the western Atlantic. There are coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, Madagascar, the Philippines, Hawaiian Islands and off Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have been preserved and identified in rocks over 400 million years old. Coral reefs are actually composed of tiny, fragile animals known as coral polyps. Coral reefs are significantly important because of the biodiversity. Although the number of fish are decreasing, the remaining coral reefs contain more unique sea creatures. The variety of species living on a coral reef is greater than anywhere else in the world. An estimation of 70-90% of fish caught are dependent on coral reefs in Southeast Asia and reefs support over 25% of all known marine species. However, those sensitive coral reefs are facing detrimental effects on them due to variety of factors: overfishing, sedimentation and pollution, bleaching, and even tourist-related damage.\nFor 50 percent of Southeast Asia's coral reefs, they are at high or very high levels of threat. Only 12 percent of the reefs are at low risk. 64 percent of the regions reefs are threatened by overfishing and 56 percent are threatened by destructive fishing techniques. Indonesia and the Philippines together possess about 77 percent of the region's coral reefs and nearly all of those reefs are threatened. Over 90 percent of the coral reefs in Cambodia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, China, and the Spratly Islands are threatened and over 85 percent of reefs of Malaysia and Indonesia are threatened. Heavy reliance on marine resources resulted in overexploitation and degradation of many coral reefs, especially those near major population centers. Major threats include overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation and pollution from land based sources. Human activities threaten an estimated 88 percent of Southeast Asia's coral reefs, jeopardizing the biological and economic value to society. Coral reefs just off the coasts of Indonesia and the Philippines possess the world's most diverse coral species and organisms. These coral reefs are susceptible to severe damage by environmental impacts and mankind. The majority of the destruction of coral reefs in Southeast Asia is due to illegal fishing practices and explosives. These explosives kill fish and shatter the coral skeletons resulting in depletion. Scientists agree that pollution, overfishing, cyanide fishing, and bleaching have negatively impacted about 85% of Indonesia's reefs.\nIn recent years, the direct and indirect effects of overfishing and pollution from agriculture and land development have been the major drivers of massive and accelerating decreases in abundance of coral reef species, causing widespread changes in reef ecosystems. Philippines is covered with 35,000 km² coral reefs. But 70% of them are degraded. The conditions of coral reefs are deteriorating on a dramatic rate. Global climate change has caused serious troubles on coral reefs. Changes in ocean chemistry due to increasing carbon dioxide level cause weakening of coral skeletons and reduce the accretion of reefs, especially at higher latitudes. Hurricanes, rising sea levels and Greenhouse are also great threats. However, the most pressing impact of climate change is coral bleaching and disease that have already increased over the past 30 years. Other than climate change, trawling, dynamite fishing, and diving tourism also have large influence on the health of coral reefs.\n\nBlast fishing, also called dynamite fishing, is a major contributor to the destruction of coral reefs. Even though blast fishing was banned in 1985, it still remains a huge threat to the Indonesia coral reefs. By filling up an empty bottle with fertiliser and kerosene a fisherman can create an improvised but powerful explosive and throw it into the ocean gaining immediate access to hundreds of dead fish. This method of fishing leaves coral reefs virtually unsalvagable, yet has become increasingly popular as the demand for fish increases but the supply steadily decreases. The explosives used to catch dead fish destroys coral reefs from the inside leaving them no room for regrowth. This effect in turn hurts Filipino fisherman because it leaves no place for fish to reproduce and thus decreases the fish population. Blast fishing became popular among Filipino fisherman in the mid-1980s, but did not gain global attention until the 1990s. Laws created to prevent blast fishing are poorly enforced by officials of this area, and fisherman are highly motivated to continue this practice for survival and profit. \"These are not poor Third World guys trying to put food on the table, go to the villages and find the people who head the dynamite fishing cooperatives are the people with new Jeeps and new satellite dishes in their houses. This is about greed,\". Indonesia and the Philippines contain about 77% of the regions coral reef systems, and with 98% of the Philippine coral reefs seriously threatened by human activities, it is obvious that there needs to be serious changes to the marine practices of the communities.\n\nCyanide fishing originated in the Philippines in the 1960s due to the growing market for aquarium fish in North America and Europe. This method of fishing is done by squirting cyanide, a poison, directly into crevices of the coral reefs. The cyanide quickly stuns the fish, making the fishermen's job much easier when catching their targeted prey. This poison is extremely harmful to the surrounding corals and all of the reef's inhabitants. Since the 1960s when this practice began, over one million kilograms of cyanide poison has been released and used to catch fish amongst the Philippine coral reefs. However, less than one half of the live fish caught by this method survive to be sold to restaurants and aquariums.\n\nAnother major problem facing the Southeast Asian Coral Reefs is sedimentation. Sedimentation is caused by development on land and agricultural runoff. Southeast Asian countries are experiencing rapid development, leading to deforestation, and construction projects near the reefs that lead to sediment eroding and covering the corals. This reduces sunlight, and smothers the coral colonies; clogging their mouths, which killing them. The nutrient rich sediment also facilitates algae growth, which can overgrow the corals. Sedimentation will continue to be a major problem as Southeast Asian economies continue to grow.\n\nThe Philippine waters are considered as having nearly 70% of its coral reefs destroyed with only 5% in good condition. Although this dynamite and cyanide fishing may be targeted at one specific location, it destroys the surrounding habitat as well, spreading over one kilometer upon each impact. It takes over one hundred years for these reefs to grow into substantial sizes, at a rate of one inch every five years. These poor fishing practices not only threaten the food habitats for many species, but also the biodiversity that makes these Philippine and Indonesian coasts so beautiful. Inland human activities is what mainly pressures these reefs' pristine states; from indirect activities such as the increasing demand within the fishing industry as well as directly, through coastal run-off and pollution.\n\nThe coral reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines are vital to food security, employment, tourism, and medicinal research. The value of the regions sustainable coral reef fisheries alone is US$2.4 billion a year. These countries rely on the marine resources as a means to diversify their economy. Due to unsafe fishing practices, the coral reefs in these countries are experiencing a decline. There are no pristine coral reefs left in the world. Coral reefs in these countries are headed toward becoming ecologically extinct. Without the abundance of Marine resources, the Philippines and Indonesia will experience a major hit to their economy.\n\nOn September 24, 2007, Reef Check (the world’s largest reef conservation organization) stated that only 5% of Philippines' 27,000 square-kilometers of coral reef are in “\"excellent condition\"\" : Tubbataha Reef, Marine Park in Palawan, Apo Island in Negros Oriental, Apo Reef in Puerto Galera, Mindoro, and Verde Island Passage off Batangas. Philippine coral reefs is 2nd largest in Asia.\n\nIndonesia has 2,915,000 square kilometers of marine area. The reef area is 51,020 square kilometers. Of that amount, 82% of it is at risk. Indonesia holds 17% of the world's total coral reef areas. Blast fishing, which has been illegal since 1985 still goes on today, along with cyanide fishing (1995). Another factor that is hurting the coral reefs in Indonesia is the amount of coral that they export. They are the world's largest exporter of corals, exporting about 500 tons of coral per year.\n\nCOREMAP is helping Indonesia with their destruction of corals by working in 9 of the 32 provinces. They want to:\n\nThe Philippines, with more than 7,000 islands and warm ocean waters, surround about 26,000 square kilometers of coral reef. These coral reefs have recently brought the attention of beneficial economic uses to the Philippines government.\n\nBenefits of Coral Reefs in Philippines\n\nFor the past 55 years, the proportion of degraded reefs in Indonesia increased from 10 to 50%. From 1989 to 2000 reefs with over 50% live coral cover declined from 36 to 29%. Western Indonesia, which is more developed and holds the majority of the nation's population, faces the greatest threats to its coral reefs. Surveys concluded that reef condition improves from west to east. The percentage of reefs in good or excellent condition (live coral cover of 50% or more) is 23% in western Indonesia versus 45% in eastern Indonesia. 65% of surveys taken from the Maluku islands had evidence of bomb damage. In addition, reefs affected by land-based pollution (i.e. sediment discharge into reefs by deforestation, industry, sewage, and fertilizer) show 30–50% less diversity at depths of three meters and 40–60% less diversity at 10 meters in comparison to pristine reefs. The 1997–1998 el Nino event triggered widespread bleaching in Indonesia, with western and west-central Indonesia most affected. Bleaching was recorded in East Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Lombok. In the Seribu Islands northwest of Jakarta, 90–95% of coral reef from the reef flat down to 25 meters died. Two years later, the Seribu Islands significantly recovered, with live coral cover of 20–30% (2000). Coral reefs in Indonesia are located near Java (Batavia), Nusa Dua, Jakarta and Saribu.\n\n30% of the Philippine's coral reefs are dead while 39% are dying. The news isn't all bad: Establishment of the Sumilon Island marine reserve has resulted in a marked comeback of fish in adjacent areas. Along with the establishment of the Sumilon Island marine reserve, there is hope for the Philippines via boosts in ecotourism. In recent years, local Filipino governments have discovered that fishing is not the only economic benefit the reefs can provide. They are confident that with a spread of ecotourism, even local fishermen will reap the financial benefits of this economic sector. A surge in coral reef conservation education is helping the tourism sector provide information to tourists on how to preserve the coral reefs while they enjoy the beauty and serenity of the reefs. The Philippines ecotourism sector is unfortunately stifled at this time due to a limited budget and there are approximately 7,000 islands to patrol for destructive fishing techniques. Destructive fishing techniques are thought to be the largest contributor to reef degradation in the Philippines.\n\nThe first ever mass-bleaching event in the Philippines was reported in 1998–99. It began at Batangas, off Luzon, in June 1998 and then proceeded nearly clockwise around the Philippines, correlating with anomalous sea-surface temperatures. Most reefs of northern Luzon, west Palawan, the Visayas, and parts of Mindanao were affected. Subsequent mortalities were highly variable, with decreases in live coral cover ranging from 0.7 to 46 percent and up to 80 percent in Bolinao. Recent surveys in 1997 found a low percentage of reefs to be in excellent condition. They found only 4 percent of Philippine reefs in excellent condition (i.e., over 75 percent hard or soft coral cover), 28 percent in good condition (50-75 percent coral cover), 42 percent in fair condition (25-50 percent coral cover), and 27 percent in poor condition (less than 25 percent coral cover). The Visayas have experienced the most significant decline in coral cover, exhibiting an average of only 11 percent hard coral cover.\n\nA study in the early 1990s revealed that coral reefs are damaged by a variety of human activities such as household sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural chemicals from land that are washed to the sea. This was a new finding for the time period in which it was widely believed that the main damage to coral reefs was causes by oil spills or from pollution dumped by ships. This survey was concentrated on SE Asia mainly because it was believed that coral reefs in this region were at great threat of extinction if continued to be unmanaged. In the last thirty years climate change has had the most harmful effect on corals. (Hughes) Currently one of the major issues the Indonesian government is dealing with is climate change. (CIA Worldfactbook) When the ocean warms such as in El Nino, coral bleaching occurs, which kills the coral. (Hughes) The reefs are incredibly important to the economy and people of Southeast Asia. The reefs bring in $1.6 billion a year through fishing, employment, and the tourist industry. (Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia Key Findings 2002)\nToday, the coral reefs located in the Philippines and Indonesia are in great danger. Fishermen are constantly practising dangerous methods such as blast fishing and dynamite fishing. These practices prove to be detrimental to the coral reefs as well as the marine life in the surrounding areas. Because of the dangerous methods, fish that are usually near the coral reefs are no longer there any more. Two of these fish are Groupers and snappers.\nAccording to David Nockels it was only seven years ago that 30% of the reefs were dead in this region and many more were dying.\n\nBleaching is one significant threat to the corals. Bleaching is a process that expels the photosynthetic algae from the corals' \"stomachs\" or polyps. This algae is called zooxanthellae. It is vital to the reef's life because it provides the coral with nutrients; it is also responsible for the color. The process is called bleaching because when the algae is ejected from the coral reef the animal loses its pigment. Zooxanthellae densities are continually changing; bleaching is really an extreme of what naturally happens. The detrimental exaggeration of the natural occurrence can be explained by the increasing temperature of the oceans which is accused to be a result of the \"Greenhouse Effect,\" or global warming (Blackman and Hughes). Biological oceanographer Paul Falkowski and marine biologist Andrew Baker from the Wildlife Conservation Society study bleaching and why it occurs. Their explanations can be put in their simplest terms as such: the algae's membrane melts from the rise in temperature and, as a result, spits out an \"oxygen species\" directly into the reef. The animal, in turn, views this process as a threat and ejects the algae as a defense mechanism. Once the zooxanthellae are expelled the coral have nothing to feed off and die. Bleaching has been shown to cause up to 90% mortality rate of the affected corals. However, there is a catch. The reefs that are victims of bleaching have been found to be affected in patches, suggesting that there are several factors that affect the bleaching threshold. Not only that, but both bleached and non-bleached corals are often found right next to each other. These cases are numerous, and the variation and impact of factors (such as species or light) are still being heavily questioned, researched, and are vaguely understood.\n\nOne of the largest potential threats of ocean acidification to marine invertebrates is the corrosive properties of undersaturated waters with respect to calcium carbonate skeletons/shells, and a theoretical inability to calcify under these conditions. Ocean acidification is a lowered pH of ocean waters caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which results in more CO2 dissolving into the ocean. This poses a threat to corals and calcifying macroalgae, two main calcifying groups that occur in reefs, as well as other shelled organisms and the organisms that depend on them. Corals and calcifying macroalgae such as coralline red algae and calcifying green algae are extremely sensitive to ocean acidification because they build their hard structures out of calcium carbonate. The sinking pH of ocean waters makes it difficult for these shelled creatures to produce enough calcium carbonate to build and maintain their skeletal structures. Echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, and mollusks, including squid and clams, as well as many other species are also at risk because of thinning shells and weakened skeletal structures. By targeting calcifying organisms, ocean acidification threatens the health of reef ecosystems as a whole.\n\nOcean acidification from increasing level of atmospheric CO2 represents a major global threat to coral reefs, and in many regions acidification is exacerbated by local smaller-scale disturbances such as overfishing. Studies have shown that severe acidification and warming alone can lower reef resilience even under high grazing intensity and low nutrients. Furthermore, the threshold at which herbivore overfishing (reduced grazing) leads to a coral-algal phase shift was lowered by acidification and warming. Also, increasing temperature and ocean acidification are predicted to have a synergistic effect; ocean warming will further magnify ocean acidification changes.\n\nMost Southeastern Asian coastal communities are socially and economically dependent upon coral reef ecosystems. 350 million people live within 50k of the coast and the majority of that population depend in one way or another upon the coral reefs. Because so many people are dependent on such a precious ecosystem, environmental impacts are not all they are facing. Along with the degradation and depletion of the physical coral and its inhabitants, the Southeastern Asian residents are facing major social and economic implications. Socially, the coral depletion could have a devastating effect on the population and the culture that is dependent upon the reefs of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe marine waters of the Philippines is five times more in area than the land it covers. Out of the 86 million people that reside in the Philippines, about 40% live on less than a dollar a day. Most people fish for personal consumption and survival. Fish consumption is estimated at around 30 kg per capita in the Philippines. Because fish are becoming scarcer as their reef habitat is gradually destroyed by cyanide and blast fishing, siltation, and bleaching, fishermen must continue to use the cheapest and most reliable methods to bring in their daily catch.\n\nThe coral reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines are vital to food security, employment, tourism, and medicinal research. The value of the regions sustainable coral reef fisheries alone is US$2.4 billion a year. These countries rely on the marine resources as a means to diversify their economy. Due to unsafe fishing practices, the coral reefs in these countries are experiencing a decline. There are no pristine coral reefs in the world. Coral reefs in these countries are headed toward becoming ecologically extinct. Without the abundance of Marine resources, the Philippines and Indonesia will experience a major hit to their economy.\n\nThe coral reef has been an integral part of Southeast Asian communities for thousands of years. According to Tiffany Adams of Hong Kong, \"With the higher demands on the coral reef to produce for the increasing population and the introduction of the world market in the last fifty years, overexploitation has become the most prevalent threat.\" The explosion of the live reef food fish and aquarium trades as markets has been detrimental to the coral reef. Economic incentives have led to the over fishing of the coral reef and the creation of new technologies to create higher yields of harvest. The use of cyanide and blast fishing has begun to destroy one of the largest coral reef environments in the world. Furthermore, the increased populations have affected the coral reef indirectly. Besides using the reef for economic gain, the increase of people has created pollution. The high levels of development and change in the methods of using the land have led to massive deforestation, which in turn has created a substantial amount of sediments and nutrient loads being placed in coastal environments. Furthermore, attempts to industrialize at the lowest cost possible have led to increased pollution without regulation. To protect and restore the coral reefs many things must be considered. The fishermen and reef harvesters must be given a new method of generating income, one that is sustainable and economically enticing that does not negatively affect the environment. Also, there is a need to manage and regulate the development of the Southeast area and the pollution from this area, while considering the environmental impacts and the economic impacts farther down the road. The task of saving the coral reef in Southeast Asia must occur within the communities which depend upon them. The problem, of a community's abuse and overuse of a natural resource, as created through desperation, poverty and a lack of oversight, cannot be handled by a foreign, external organization or a well-intended NGO. Such as the result of the incredibly successful restoration of Apo Island's reef, the local people must decide as a community to manage the reefs so that they may continue to sustain themselves through this essential resource.\n\nWilkinson, C.R., L.M.

It is very important to have tourist education programs to reduce stress on coral reefs caused by tourists who are unaware how easily damaged corals can be. One such negative effect of tourism that can easily be avoided is people walking on coral, and breaking it. Walking near corals also can lead to sediment being stirred up and covering corals, which leads to coral death and makes it very difficult for corals to re-colonize the area. Dive tourism can be beneficial to coral reefs by creating funding for protection programs, including Marine Protected Areas. By simply charging dive fees at certain dive sites, money can be generated for the conservation of coral reefs.\n\nAmongst the many proposed solutions to the problems plaguing coral reefs in Southeast Asia is the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Currently marine protected areas make up around 8% of the area of Southeast Asian coral reefs. The World Commission on Protected Areas, amongst other groups, has been active in establishing MPAs in Southeast Asia. However, the success rate of MPAs in Southeast Asia is low, with an estimated 14% of MPAs rated effectively managed. This rate reflects the difficulty of implementing MPAs. Moreover, it shows that much work is still needed to make MPAs successful in Southeast Asia.\n\nIUCN has defined an MPA as “any area of intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with\nits overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which\nhas been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed\nenvironment”. In other words, an MPA is a marine area in which the water column and all the life that exists in it are protected through laws. These laws restrict certain practices within the MPA, which can differ per MPA.\n\nMarine protected areas, in sum, provide a marine sanctuary which can foster an increase in marine biodiversity. (See also:). This increased biodiversity is thought to be able to carry over to the non-protected surrounding areas in which fishing can take place. This is important for a number of reasons. In the Southeast Asian context, especially amongst the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, the sea and people are very much interconnected. As mentioned, the sea provides both a source of income and source of food for the people. In the Philippines, for example, 67% of protein food consumption comes from fish and fish products. Additionally, roughly one million people in the Philippines are employed in the fishing industry. Increased fish stocks resulting from marine protected areas only add to the solutions needed to revitalize Southeast Asian economies, life systems, and coral reefs.\n\nIn addition, the LMMA (Locally-Managed Marine Area) Network is another organization that takes part in the Southeast Asia marine conservation. Similar to the MPA, the LMMA also provides protection areas in the sea. However, according to the definition above, an LMMA is an example of an MPA because an MPA includes a large space within and close by the area. The LMMA involves members from around the world, and the communities within the managed areas. The goal of LMMA is to allow members and local communities to learn the uses of protected resources.\n\nDue to the massive destruction of coral reefs in Southeast Asia, the LMMA has established two areas in Eastern Indonesia: Padaido Islands, Biak, West Papua, and Southern Ambon Island and the Moluccas Islands; and various areas in the Philippines. With the help of the LMMAs, the local communities would learn to preserve their marine goods, and be able to maintain for longer years. Gradually, the communities will accommodate bigger and healthier fish.\n\nThere are an estimated 400 MPAs in the Philippines. Of the 400 only 16% have yielded an increase in bio-diversity. The high failure rate is due to poor management and a lack of regulation. Despite the numerous failures there have been successes. One of the best known areas is Apo island where a small community has effectively managed an MPA since the mid-1980s. The Apo MPA includes a ban on detrimental fishing practices and a no-take zone covering 10% of their reef. Apo's reef has thrived giving hope to Philippine reefs.\n\nThe state of the coral reefs in the Philippines and Indonesia are depleting with every blink of an eye. It is to no one's surprise that the Philippines have lost more than 80% since the 1920s. In Indonesia it is a little better due to the some drastic actions made by the government. On December 6, 2002 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a US$33 million loan in order to save what is the rest of these important organisms. Over fishing, illegal fishing methods, and overpopulation have all contributed to the decline of the coral reefs both in the Philippines and Indonesia. Along with the loan the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project (Phase II), the second part of a three phase plan has given us all hope in restoring coral reefs in this part of the region. The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries will oversee the whole entire project with a due date of June 30, 2009. If it all goes according to plan the fishing industry will be the benefited the most.\n\nHowever, government action is not always necessary to manage reefs. When the community dependent on the resources provided by coral works together to save and restore the fish population, the results can be very good. The community managed reefs of Apo Island, located in the southern Philippines, known worldwide for its success. The waters around Apo Island are home to about 650 species of fish and 400 species of corals. The waters of Apo Island were not always this full of life. Fishing is the major occupation on the island, and even those who do not fish, rely on the catch for their protein. So when a fisherman's catch began shortening, after years of unregulated fishing, it was very easy for them to resort to destructive methods of fishing, such as blast fishing and cyanide fishing, to get by. These methods almost led to the end of the already dwindling fish stocks. The community began, through education and widespread involvement, the process of making these practices socially unacceptable. People began patrolling the waters in a small area with the intention of allowing fish to flourish and repopulate and then spill over into areas that had been fished out. This informal establishment of a sanctuary was first met with a lot of resistance, eventually though, after seeing the obvious improvements, the island community and local council were able to formalize the sanctuary in 1985, three years after it started. This formalization extended the sanctuary to water surrounding the island up to 500 meters from the shore and declaring a portion a no-take fish sanctuary.\n\nTo manage the coral reefs effectively to preserve what is left of the beautiful natural resource, individual people must unite. If the marine ornamentals trade is to successfully turn around and begin to sustain more live fish, certain people must perform their jobs to the fullest. Firstly, there if lobbyists are responsible about the issue, they will provide healthy animals, maintain healthy reefs, sustain reef animal populations, and adequately compensate fishing communities for their efforts. Also, responsible industry operators must minimize animal mortality and habitat impacts and focus on animal health and quality collection practices. The problem with this method, though, is that merely trust and word of mouth aren't enough. If we are to legitimately stop depleting the coral reefs in Southeast Asia, we must set international standards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1900557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900557", "title": "Matthew 2", "text": "Matthew 2\n\nMatthew 2 is the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. It describes the events after the birth of Jesus, the visit of the magi and the attempt by King Herod to kill the infant messiah, Joseph and his family's flight into Egypt, and their later return to live in Israel, settling in Nazareth.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 23 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nEach of the four sections in this chapter refers to a quotation from the Old Testament which Matthew sees Jesus fulfilling:\n\nThe last portion of Matthew 1 is similarly written, with a quotation from , and is often seen as part of this same section. Theologian Krister Stendahl notes that each of the four quotes in this chapter contain place names, and sees this entire chapter as an apology for why the messiah moved from the important centre of Bethlehem to the minor one of Nazareth.\n\nFrance notes that the Old Testament quotations in this chapter are \"notoriously obscure and unconvincing.\" Many of them are heavily modified from the originals, with some passages being reversed in meaning. Almost all of them are taken out of context, and presented as prophecy when they were not in the original. The most confusing is that cited in , which does not appear anywhere in the Old Testament. Jerome associates it with , where the etymology of \"Nazareth\" is derived from the Hebrew word for \"branch\" (\"ne'tser\"). That the quotations have been so contorted to fit the narrative, is to France and others, clear evidence that the narrative came first, and the quotations were added after. The author of Matthew firmly believed in the accuracy of the narrative he was recording, and would not alter it to make it better fit the prophecies.\n\nAs with Matthew 1 most scholars see this chapter as geared towards proving that Jesus is the messiah who was foretold by the prophets. The chapter contains five references to the Old Testament, a greater density than anywhere else in the New Testament. The author of Matthew uses them to try and demonstrate that Jesus matches the predictions of the prophets. Schweizer sees the chapter as being divided into five subsections, each ending with an Old Testament quotation. As with the genealogy of Matthew 1 many scholars feel that this chapter is trying to portray Jesus as the culmination of Jewish history with the author of Matthew relating events in Jesus' life to important ones in history. The author of Matthew is paralleling Exodus in this chapter with Jesus as Moses and Herod as Pharaoh. The Gospel also takes care to mention a sojourn by the Holy Family in Egypt that is mentioned nowhere else. Through a quote from Jeremiah (), the Massacre of the Innocents is linked to the Babylonian Captivity, and Jesus being born in Bethlehem echoes King David who was also born in that village.\n\nAt the same time this chapter also contains several passages that are often seen as anti-Semitic. and both show the Jewish leaders and people of Jerusalem acting in lockstep with the tyrant Herod who tries to kill the infant. The historicity of this is dubious as other sources show great rivalry and animosity between the two. American theologian Robert H. Gundry notes that persecution is an important theme of Matthew, who was writing at a time when a number of forces were working to crush the new religious movement.\n\nMost of what is in this chapter is found in no other gospel and differs sharply from the infancy narrative in Luke 2. Evangelical scholars have developed theories to explain these discrepancies which allow them to stand by the inerrancy of the Bible. Other scholars feel that this part of the Gospel of Matthew is not a literal work of history: for example, Gundry sees Matthew's gospel as a heavily embellished version of Luke's, with the humble shepherds transformed into the more exotic magi.\n\nIn the King James Version this chapter reads:\n\nSaying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.<br>\nWhen Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.<br>\nAnd when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.<br>\nAnd they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,<br>\nAnd thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.<br>\nThen Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.<br>\nAnd he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.<br>\nWhen they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.<br>\nWhen they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.<br>\nAnd when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.<br>\nAnd being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.<br>\nAnd when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.<br>\nWhen he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:<br>\nAnd was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.<br>\nThen Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.<br>\nThen was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,<br>\nIn Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.<br>\nBut when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,<br>\nSaying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.<br>\nAnd he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.<br>\nBut when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:<br>\nAnd he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\n\n"}

Its collection consists of European and American paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, photographs, and decorative arts from the fourteenth to the early twentieth century. The Clark, along with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMoCA) and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), forms a trio of art museums in the Berkshires. The institute also serves as a center for research and higher learning. It is home to various research and academic programs, which include the Fellowship Program and the Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art. It is visited by 200,000 people a year.\n\n\"The Clark\" was created by entrepreneur, soldier, explorer, and prominent art collector Robert Sterling Clark, and his wife, Francine. After numerous adventures in the Far East, Sterling settled in Paris in 1911 and used a considerable fortune inherited from his grandfather (a principal in the Singer Sewing Machine Company) to begin amassing a private art collection. Francine joined him in collecting works of art after their marriage in 1919.\n\nThe Clarks kept their collection largely private, rarely lending out any works. With the onset of the Cold War and rapid nuclear armament, they became increasingly worried about the safety of their artworks. They wanted to protect their collection from a possible attack on New York City, where they lived and where the expected heir of their collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was located. As such, the Clarks began looking at sites in rural New York and Massachusetts with the intention of founding a museum for their art.\n\nThey visited Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1949 and began having conversations with town leaders and the administrators of Williams College and the Williams College Museum of Art. Sterling had ties to the college through his grandfather and father, both of whom had been trustees. A charter for the Clark was signed on March 14, 1950 and the Institute opened to the public on May 17, 1955 under its first director, former silver dealer Peter Guille. The Clark has since become a destination for tourists, art lovers, and scholars, helping to establish the cultural reputation of the Berkshires. \n\nThe original marble gallery building, designed by Daniel Deverell Perry, opened in 1955. The Pietro Belluschi-designed Manton Research Center, housing the library and research programs, was completed in 1973. The Clark embarked on a long-term project in 2001 to improve its campus, enlisting the help of landscape firm Reed Hildebrand and architects Tadao Ando and Annabelle Selldorf.\n\nReed Hilderbrand redesigned the campus grounds, revamping nearby walking trails, planting 1,000 trees, and creating a reflecting pool fed by recycled water.\n\nTadao Ando designed two additions: the Lunder Center at Stone Hill and the 42,600-square-foot Clark Center, which opened in 2008 and 2014, respectively. Envisioned as a sanctuary in the woods waiting to be discovered, the Lunder Center features two galleries and a seasonal terrace café. It is also home to the Williamstown Art Conservation Center, the largest regional conservation center in the country.\n\nThe Clark Center includes more than 11,000 square feet of gallery space for special exhibitions; new dining, retail, and family spaces; and an all-glass Museum Pavilion that creates a new entrance to the original Museum Building. Situated northwest of the Museum Building, the stone, concrete, and glass Clark Center is the centerpiece of the Clark's campus and serves as its primary visitor entrance.\n\nAnnabelle Selldorf was commissioned to renovate the campus’ existing structures. In the 1955 original marble building, galleries for American and decorative art were added and exhibition space was increased by 15%. In the Manton Research Center, which reopened in 2016, the auditorium and central courtyard were renovated and several galleries and a study center were created. Its renovation marked the completion of the Clark's all-encompassing expansion project.\n\nThe Research and Academic Program is the manifestation of the Clark's original commitment to academic research and scholarly study. The program began in the late 1990s with the establishment of the Clark Library and the Graduate Program in the History of Art. Under the direction of John Onians, Michael Ann Holly, and Darby English, the program has since widened its purview to partner with both regional and international institutions and scholars to challenge and expand the scope of the study and production of the visual arts. Caroline Fowler is the Starr Director of the Research and Academic Program at the Clark and teaches in the Graduate Program in Art History at Williams College.\n\nThe Research and Academic Program also awards between ten and sixteen Clark Fellowships a year, ranging in duration from four weeks to ten months. Clark Fellowships allow promising scholars, critics, and museum officials opportunities for research outside of their professional obligations. Fellows, along with scholars and students from all stretches of the world, are encouraged to participate in the various conferences, colloquia, workshops, curator round tables, and seminars hosted by the program.\n\nPublications like The Clark Studies in the Visual Arts, as based on the proceedings of the annual Clark Conferences, serve as another forum for the interdisciplinary exploration of art historical issues.\n\nThe Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art, established in 1972 in cooperation with the Clark, is an intensive two-year program that combines academic work, curatorial internships, workshops, an international study tour, and a range of instructors to culminate in a degree of the master of arts in the history of art. Located on the Clark Campus, the program draws on and works closely with the art history resources of both institutions. Of the nearly 1,500 graduates of the program, notable alumni include Cara Starke, Director of the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, James Rondeau, Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Paul Provost, Deputy Chairman of Christie's.\n\nThe Clark offers extensive public educational programs that range from guided gallery talks to lectures, film series, studio art courses, and interactive activities for children to engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds with the Clark's collections and exhibitions. The interactive nature of the programs reflects the general mission of the Clark to advance the public understanding of art's transformative power.\n\nThe Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing has been awarded every other year since 2006. The prize \"celebrates informed, insightful, and accessible prose that advances the public understanding and appreciation of the visual arts.\" The award is presented for \"critical or historical writing that conveys complex ideas in a manner that is grounded in scholarship yet appealing to a diverse range of audiences.\"\n\nIn 2006, three people were honored. Since then, one person has been selected each time it has been given.[8] Winners of the Prize are:\n\nThe museum's most recent $145 million expansion project has been funded through private donations, foundation support, the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund, and bond financing organized in conjunction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nInitially, the Clarks concentrated on Italian, Dutch, and Flemish Old Master paintings. Over time, their tastes shifted towards artists like John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. After 1920, the Clarks focused mainly on the art of 19th-century France — specifically works of Impressionism and the Barbizon School. Over the next 35 years, the Clarks would add to their private collection, increasing their holdings of paintings, porcelain, silver, prints, and drawings from the early fourteenth to the early twentieth century.\n\nSince its establishment in 1955, the Clark Art Institute has continued to grow its collection through acquisitions, gifts, and bequests, with a recent focus on expanding its photography collection. In 2007, the Manton Foundation donated the collection of its founders, Sir Edwin and Lady Manton, to the museum. The Manton Collection of British Art includes more than 200 works by British artists like J.M.W. Turner, Thomas Gainsborough, and John Constable. In 2013, Frank and Katherine Martucci gave the museum eight George Inness landscapes, supplementing his two works already in the collection.\n\nToday, the museum is best known for its works of French Impressionism, specifically the paintings of Renoir, academic paintings by Jean-Léon Gérôme and William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and its collection of European and American silver.\n\n"}

With staffages (e.g. grotto) and weeping trees a sense of emotional aesthetics should be developed. Typical of this kind of park design is clear structure and domestic animals, a necessary component of the garden, as seen in former times in the Luisium Palace near Dessau in Germany or still existing the historistic park of Villa Haas (Hesse) from 1892. \nLivestock in the park serve to enhance the idyll (nature experience). The park area therefore had to be redesigned to protect the plants (walls, hedges, watercourses, fences).\n\nThe term \"Ornamental Farm\", which is still used today in manors with small park areas, forms a flowing border to this. \nHere, too, beauty always serves the useful. \nAn own German garden style, as demanded by the leading German garden theorist Hirschfeld and his pupils, is never concretized in the literature compared to the French or English style. Therefore, in addition to the usual references to ancient mythology, the German style is limited to the decoration of statues, memorial stones, etc. of national importance.\n\nIf the English landscape garden mostly is the expression of a liberal bourgeoisie, the German garden is more oriented towards the model of the nobility and later incorporates elements of German Romanticism and other styles.\n\nOften the style concept is confused with the \"new German gardening\". Here, more emphasis is placed on easy-care, location-loyal shrubs and color aesthetics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900593", "title": "Imperial Regalia", "text": "Imperial Regalia\n\nThe Imperial Regalia, also Imperial Insignia (in German \"Reichskleinodien\", \"Reichsinsignien\" or \"Reichsschatz\"), are regalia of the Holy Roman Emperor. The most important parts are the Imperial Crown, the Holy Lance and the Imperial Sword. Today they are kept at the Imperial Treasury in the Hofburg palace in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe Imperial Regalia are the only completely preserved regalia from the Middle Ages.\nDuring the late Middle Ages, the word Imperial Regalia (Reichskleinodien) had many variations in the Latin language. The regalia were named in Latin: \"insignia imperialia, regalia insignia, insignia imperalis capellae quae regalia dicuntur\" and other similar words.\n\nThe regalia is composed of two different parts. The greater group are the so-called Nürnberger Kleinodien (roughly translated \"Nuremberg jewels\"), named after the town of Nuremberg, where the regalia were kept from 1424 to 1796. This part comprised the Imperial Crown, parts of the coronation vestments, the Imperial Orb, the Imperial Sceptre, the Imperial Sword, the Ceremonial Sword, the Imperial Cross, the Holy Lance, and all other reliquaries except St. Stephen's Purse.\n\nSt. Stephen's Purse, the Imperial Bible, and the so-called Sabre of Charlemagne were kept in Aachen until 1794, which gave them the name Aachener Kleinodien (\"Aachen jewels\"). It is not known how long they have been considered among the Imperial Regalia, nor how long they had been in Aachen.\n\nThe inventory of the regalia during the late Middle Ages normally consisted only of five to six items. Goffredo da Viterbo counted following items: the Imperial Cross, the Holy Lance, the crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the sword. On other lists, however, the sword is not mentioned.\n\nWhether the medieval chronicles really do refer to the same regalia which are kept in Vienna today depends on a variety of factors. Descriptions of the emperors only spoke of them being “clothed in imperial regalia” without exactly describing which items they were.\n\nThe crown can only be dated back to the 13th century, when it is described in a medieval poem. The poem speaks of the \"Waise\" (i.e., \"The Orphan\") stone, which was a big and prominent jewel on the front of the crown, probably a white opal with an exceptionally brilliant red fire and has since been replaced by a triangular blue sapphire. The first definite pictorial image of the crown can only be found later in a mural in the Karlstein Castle close to Prague.\n\nIt is also difficult to define for how long the Imperial and Ceremonial Swords have belonged to the regalia.\n\nUntil the 15th century the Imperial Regalia had no firm depository and sometimes accompanied the ruler on his trips through the empire. Above all with conflicts around the legality of the rule it was important to own the insignia. As depositories during this time some imperial castles or seats of reliable ministerialises are known:\n\nEmperor Sigismund transferred the Imperial Regalia \"to everlasting preservation\" to the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg with a dated document on 29 September 1423. They arrived there on 22 March in the next year from Plintenburg coming and were kept in the \"Heilig-Geist-Spital\". They left this place regularly for the \"Heiltumsweisungen\" (, yearly on the fourteenth day after Good Friday) and for coronations.\n\nSince the Age of Enlightenment at least, the imperial regalia had no constitutive or confirming character for the imperial function any more. It served merely as an adornment for the coronation of the emperors, who all belonged to the House of Habsburg and since the early 16th century had ceased to be crowned by the pope. \nJohann Wolfgang Goethe on 3 April 1764, was an eyewitness in Frankfurt during the coronation of the 18-year-old Joseph, Duke of Lorraine to King in Germany. He wrote dismissively about the event in his autobiography \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\" ():\n\nWhile French troops were advancing in 1794 in the direction of Aachen, the pieces located there were spent in the Capuchin's monastery to Paderborn. In July 1796 French troops crossed the Rhine and shortly after reached Franconia. On 23 July a part of the Imperial Regalia (crown, sceptre, orb, eight pieces of the vestments) were transported by Nuremberg colonel Johann Georg Haller von Hallerstein from Nuremberg to Regensburg, where they arrived on the next day. On 28 September the remaining parts of the jewels were also delivered to Regensburg. Since this elopement parts of the treasure are missing.\n\nUntil 1800 the Imperial Regalia remained in the St. Emmeram Castle in Regensburg, from where on 30 June their transfer began to Vienna. There the committal is verified for 29 October. The pieces from Aachen were brought in 1798 to Hildesheim and reached Vienna not before 1801.\n\nAfter the \"Anschluss\" of Austria to the Nazi Reich in 1938 the imperial regalia were returned on instruction by Adolf Hitler to Nuremberg, where they were exhibited in the Katharinenkirche. In the Second World War they were stored for protection from air raids in the \"Historischer Kunstbunker\" () beneath Nuremberg Castle.\nIn 1945 the imperial regalia were found there by US soldiers and were brought back in 1946 to the Hofburg in Vienna.\n\n\n\n"}

It is an agricultural and tourist center of some importance with a population of about 41,000. Its name refers to a type of bamboo cane. It is one of the cities on the Bogotá-Medellín highway. Its main plaza is featured on the Colombian ten-thousand pesos bill, and is one of the seats of the Roman Catholic Diocese of La Dorada–Guaduas\n\nThe early inhabitants of the \"Valley of the Guaduas\" were the indigenous Panche people. It was an important stop on the road from Santa Fe (now Bogotá) to Honda, located in a small, fertile valley. The town proper was founded on April 20, 1572 by Andrés Díaz Venero de Leiva. It was abandoned after its foundation until December 13, 1610, when Fray Tomas de Morales founded the Franciscan monastery of \"La Soledad\" on the same location. It was recognized officially as a \"villa\" on December 27, 1644 and formally re-founded by Francisco Pérez de Guzmán.\n\nIn 1696, Guaduas became a parish seat, thanks to a charter from King Charles II. The convent was closed around 1805. In 1809 Fray Domingo de Petres, a Capuchin architect who also directed the construction of the Cathedral of Bogotá, began building a church in the village. The original convent building was subsequently transformed into a prison by order of the Congress of Cucuta.\n\nGuaduas was a center of botanical experimentation, which included the introduction of \"níspero\" trees from the West Indies in the late 18th century.

{"id": "1900609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900609", "title": "External validity", "text": "External validity\n\nExternal validity is the validity of applying the conclusions of a scientific study outside the context of that study. In other words, it is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to and across other situations, people, stimuli, and times. In contrast, internal validity is the validity of conclusions drawn \"within\" the context of a particular study. Because general conclusions are almost always a goal in research, external validity is an important property of any study. Mathematical analysis of external validity concerns a determination of whether generalization across heterogeneous populations is feasible, and devising statistical and computational methods that produce valid generalizations.\n\n\"A threat to external validity is an explanation of how you might be wrong in making a generalization from the findings of a particular study.\" In most cases, generalizability is limited when the effect of one factor (i.e. the independent variable) depends on other factors. Therefore, all threats to external validity can be described as statistical interactions. Some examples include:\n\n\nNote that a study's \"external\" validity is limited by its \"internal\" validity. If a causal inference made within a study is invalid, then generalizations of that inference to other contexts will also be invalid.\n\nCook and Campbell made the crucial distinction between generalizing \"to\" some population and generalizing \"across\" subpopulations defined by different levels of some background factor. Lynch has argued that it is almost never possible to generalize \"to\" meaningful populations except as a snapshot of history, but it is possible to test the degree to which the effect of some cause on some dependent variable generalizes \"across\" subpopulations that vary in some background factor. That requires a test of whether the treatment effect being investigated is moderated by interactions with one or more background factors.\n\nWhereas enumerating threats to validity may help researchers avoid unwarranted generalizations, many of those threats can be disarmed, or neutralized in a systematic way, so as to enable a valid generalization. Specifically, experimental findings from one population can be \"re-processed\", or \"re-calibrated\" so as to circumvent population differences and produce valid generalizations in a second population, where experiments cannot be performed. Pearl and Bareinboim classified generalization problems into two categories: (1) those that lend themselves to valid re-calibration, and (2) those where external validity is theoretically impossible. Using graph-based calculus, they derived a necessary and sufficient condition for a problem instance to enable a valid generalization, and devised algorithms that automatically produce the needed re-calibration, whenever such exists. This reduces the external validity problem to an exercise in graph theory, and has led some philosophers to conclude that the problem is now solved.\n\nAn important variant of the external validity problem deals with selection bias, also known as sampling bias—that is, bias created when studies are conducted on non-representative samples of the intended population. For example, if a clinical trial is conducted on college students, an investigator may wish to know whether the results generalize to the entire population, where attributes such as age, education, and income differ substantially from those of a typical student. The graph-based method of Bareinboim and Pearl identifies conditions under which sample selection bias can be circumvented and, when these conditions are met, the method constructs an unbiased estimator of the average causal effect in the entire population. The main difference between generalization from improperly sampled studies and generalization across disparate populations lies in the fact that disparities among populations are usually caused by preexisting factors, such as age or ethnicity, whereas selection bias is often caused by post-treatment conditions, for example, patients dropping out of the study, or patients selected by severity of injury. When selection is governed by post-treatment factors, unconventional re-calibration methods are required to ensure bias-free estimation, and these methods are readily obtained from the problem's \ngraph.\n\nIf age is judged to be a major factor causing treatment effect to vary from individual to individual, then age differences between the sampled students and the general population would lead to a biased estimate of the average treatment effect in that population. Such bias can be corrected though by a simple re-weighing procedure: We take the age-specific effect in the student subpopulation and compute its average using the age distribution in the general population. This would give us an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect in the population. If, on the other hand, the relevant factor that distinguishes the study sample from the general population is in itself affected by the treatment, then a different re-weighing scheme need be invoked. Calling this factor \"Z\", we again average the \"z\"-specific effect of \"X\" on \"Y\" in the experimental sample, but now we weigh it by the \"causal effect\" of \"X\" on \"Z\". In other words, the new weight is the proportion of units attaining level \"Z=z\" had treatment \"X=x\" been administered to the entire population. This interventional probability, often written formula_1, can sometimes be estimated from \nobservational studies in the general population.\n\nA typical example of this nature occurs when \"Z\" is a mediator between the treatment and outcome, For instance, the treatment may be a cholesterol- reducing drug, \"Z\" may be cholesterol level, and \"Y\" life expectancy. Here, \"Z\" is both affected by the treatment and a major factor in determining the outcome, \"Y\". Suppose that subjects selected for the experimental study \ntend to have higher cholesterol levels than is typical in the general population. To estimate the average effect of the drug on survival in the entire population, we first compute the \"z\"-specific treatment effect in the experimental study, and then average it using formula_1 as a weighting function. The estimate obtained will be bias-free even when \"Z\" and \"Y\" are confounded—that is, when there is an unmeasured common factor that affects both \"Z\" and \"Y\".\n\nThe precise conditions ensuring the validity of this and other weighting schemes are formulated in Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016 and Bareinboim et al., 2014.\n\nIn many studies and research designs, there may be a trade-off between internal validity and external validity: Attempts to increase internal validity may also limit the generalizability of the findings, and vice versa.\nThis situation has led many researchers call for \"ecologically valid\" experiments. By that they mean that experimental procedures should resemble \"real-world\" conditions. They criticize the lack of ecological validity in many laboratory-based studies with a focus on artificially controlled and constricted environments. Some researchers think external validity and ecological validity are closely related in the sense that causal inferences based on ecologically valid research designs often allow for higher degrees of generalizability than those obtained in an artificially produced lab environment. However, this again relates to the distinction between generalizing to some population (closely related to concerns about ecological validity) and generalizing across subpopulations that differ on some background factor. Some findings produced in ecologically valid research settings may hardly be generalizable, and some findings produced in highly controlled settings may claim near-universal external validity. Thus, external and ecological validity are independent—a study may possess external validity but not ecological validity, and vice versa.\n\nWithin the qualitative research paradigm, external validity is replaced by the concept of transferability. Transferability is the ability of research results to transfer to situations with similar parameters, populations and characteristics.\n\nIt is common for researchers to claim that experiments are by their nature low in external validity. Some claim that many drawbacks can occur when following the experimental method. By the virtue of gaining enough control over the situation so as to randomly assign people to conditions and rule out the effects of extraneous variables, the situation can become somewhat artificial and distant from real life.\n\nThere are two kinds of generalizability at issue:\n\nHowever, both of these considerations pertain to Cook and Campbell's concept of generalizing \"to\" some target population rather than the arguably more central task of assessing the generalizability of findings from an experiment \"across\" subpopulations that differ from the specific situation studied and people who differ from the respondents studied in some meaningful way.\n\nCritics of experiments suggest that external validity could be improved by use of field settings (or, at a minimum, realistic laboratory settings) and by use of true probability samples of respondents. However, if one's goal is to understand generalizability \"across\" subpopulations that differ in situational or personal background factors, these remedies do not have the efficacy in increasing external validity that is commonly ascribed to them. If background factor X treatment interactions exist of which the researcher is unaware (as seems likely), these research practices can mask a substantial lack of external validity. Dipboye and Flanagan (1979), writing about industrial and organizational psychology, note that the evidence is that findings from one field setting and from one lab setting are equally \"unlikely\" to generalize to a second field setting. Thus, field studies are not by their nature high in external validity and laboratory studies are not by their nature low in external validity. It depends in both cases whether the particular treatment effect studied would change with changes in background factors that are held constant in that study. If one's study is \"unrealistic\" on the level of some background factor that does not interact with the treatments, it has no effect on external validity. It is only if an experiment holds some background factor constant at an unrealistic level and if varying that background factor would have revealed a strong Treatment x Background factor interaction, that external validity is threatened.\n\nResearch in psychology experiments attempted in universities are often criticized for being conducted in artificial situations and that it cannot be generalized to real life. To solve this problem, social psychologists attempt to increase the generalizability of their results by making their studies as realistic as possible. As noted above, this is in the hope of generalizing to some specific population. Realism per se does not help the make statements about whether the results would change if the setting were somehow more realistic, or if study participants were placed in a different realistic setting. If only one setting is tested, it is not possible to make statements about generalizability across settings.\n\nHowever, many authors conflate external validity and realism. There is more than one way that an experiment can be realistic:\n\nThis is referred to the extent to which an experiment is similar to real-life situations as the experiment's mundane realism.\n\nIt is more important to ensure that a study is high in psychological realism—how similar the psychological processes triggered in an experiment are to psychological processes that occur in everyday life.\n\nPsychological realism is heightened if people find themselves engrossed in a real event. To accomplish this, researchers sometimes tell the participants a cover story—a false description of the study's purpose. If however, the experimenters were to tell the participants the purpose of the experiment then such a procedure would be low in psychological realism. In everyday life, no one knows when emergencies are going to occur and people do not have time to plan responses to them. This means that the kinds of psychological processes triggered would differ widely from those of a real emergency, reducing the psychological realism of the study.\n\nPeople don't always know why they do what they do, or what they do until it happens. Therefore, describing an experimental situation to participants and then asking them to respond normally will produce responses that may not match the behavior of people who are actually in the same situation. We cannot depend on people's predictions about what they would do in a hypothetical situation; we can only find out what people will really do when we construct a situation that triggers the same psychological processes as occur in the real world.\n\nSocial psychologists study the way in which people in general are susceptible to social influence. Several experiments have documented an interesting, unexpected example of social influence, whereby the mere knowledge that others were present reduced the likelihood that people helped.\n\nThe only way to be certain that the results of an experiment represent the behaviour of a particular population is to ensure that participants are randomly selected from that population. Samples in experiments cannot be randomly selected just as they are in surveys because it is impractical and expensive to select random samples for social psychology experiments. It is difficult enough to convince a random sample of people to agree to answer a few questions over the telephone as part of a political poll, and such polls can cost thousands of dollars to conduct. Moreover, even if one somehow was able to recruit a truly random sample, there can be unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of the experimental treatments... A treatment can have a positive effect on some subgroups but a negative effect on others. The effects shown in the treatment averages may not generalize to any subgroup.\n\nMany researchers address this problem by studying basic psychological processes that make people susceptible to social influence, assuming that these processes are so fundamental that they are universally shared. Some social psychologist processes do vary in different cultures and in those cases, diverse samples of people have to be studied.\n\nThe ultimate test of an experiment's external validity is replication — conducting the study over again, generally with different subject populations or in different settings. Researches will often use different methods, to see if they still get the same results.\n\nWhen many studies of one problem are conducted, the results can vary. Several studies might find an effect of the number of bystanders on helping behaviour, whereas a few do not. To make sense out of this, there is a statistical technique called meta-analysis that averages the results of two or more studies to see if the effect of an independent variable is reliable. A meta analysis essentially tells us the probability that the findings across the results of many studies are attributable to chance or to the independent variable. If an independent variable is found to have an effect in only one of 20 studies, the meta-analysis will tell you that that one study was an exception and that, on average, the independent variable is not influencing the dependent variable. If an independent variable is having an effect in most of the studies, the meta analysis is likely to tell us that, on average, it does influence the dependent variable.\n\nThere can be reliable phenomena that are not limited to the laboratory. For example, increasing the number of bystanders has been found to inhibit helping behaviour with many kinds of people, including children, university students, and future ministers; in Israel; in small towns and large cities in the U.S.; in a variety of settings, such as psychology laboratories, city streets, and subway trains; and with a variety of types of emergencies, such as seizures, potential fires, fights, and accidents, as well as with less serious events, such as having a flat tire. Many of these replications have been conducted in real-life settings where people could not possibly have known that an experiment was being conducted.\n\nWhen conducting experiments in psychology, some believe that there is always a trade-off between internal and external validity—\n\nSome researchers believe that a good way to increase external validity is by conducting field experiments. In a field experiment, people's behavior is studied outside the laboratory, in its natural setting. A field experiment is identical in design to a laboratory experiment, except that it is conducted in a real-life setting. The participants in a field experiment are unaware that the events they experience are in fact an experiment. Some claim that the external validity of such an experiment is high because it is taking place in the real world, with real people who are more diverse than a typical university student sample. However, as real-world settings differ dramatically, findings in one real-world setting may or may not generalize to another real-world setting.\n\nNeither internal nor external validity are captured in a single experiment. Social psychologists opt first for internal validity, conducting laboratory experiments in which people are randomly assigned to different conditions and all extraneous variables are controlled. Other social psychologists prefer external validity to control, conducting most of their research in field studies, and many do both. Taken together, both types of studies meet the requirements of the perfect experiment. Through replication, researchers can study a given research question with maximal internal and external validity.\n\n"}
