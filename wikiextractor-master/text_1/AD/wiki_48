West previously worked as a host for the Shop At Home Network. In the 1990s, West achieved a degree of fame for his loud, energetic, abrasive sales pitches on late night television, and his blunt obvious observations, with his persuasive style.\n\nDon West is the pitchman for WildWestDeals.com, an internet marketing site. West was born in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Purdue University, where he majored in sports broadcasting. West currently resides in Wenatchee, Washington.\n\nWest initially became involved with television shopping when he applied for a job with the Shop at Home Network as the host of a sports memorabilia show, \"Sports Collectibles\". Despite his degree in sports broadcasting (and the fact that his brother Dale was the chief financial officer of the Shop at Home Network), West was rejected on the basis of his \"scrabbly voice\". In 1991, West began selling knives on television, and in March 1993, he was finally given the job with the Shop at Home Network that he had applied for. Between 1993 and 2001, sales rose from US$3 million to US$150 million. In addition to sports memorabilia, West also pitched products such as Beanie Babies and Pokémon collectibles.\n\nBetween November 1996 and March 1997, Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan parodied West and his co-host, Eddy Lewis, on three episodes of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nIn 2001, West amicably left the Shop at Home Network and began hosting a sports talk show on WNSR.\n\nIn 2000, West was contacted by World Championship Wrestling booker Vince Russo, who invited him to join the company. West declined the offer in favor of \"the sure thing\" (WCW was purchased by its chief competitor, the World Wrestling Federation, in March 2001).\n\nAccording to the December 9, 2007 episode of Shop At Home's \"The Sports Room\" show with hosts Kevin Hite and Shawn Leflar, Don West would be a guest host on the December 16, 2007 episode of \"The Sports Room\" and make a sculpture of the Empire State building out of butter.\n\nIn 2002, West was hired by Jeff Jarrett, who had been introduced to West by Russo, to serve as the color commentator for his newly formed professional wrestling promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (now known as Impact Wrestling). West made his professional wrestling debut on June 19, 2002, commentating on the inaugural TNA pay-per-view alongside Ed Ferrara and Mike Tenay. Ferrera departed TNA in August 2002, reducing the commentary team to Tenay and West.\n\nAside from commentating, West accompanies Jeremy Borash on the YouTube-based show \"TNA Today\", where he promotes new TNA merchandise and special packages, called \"Don West's Insane Daily Deals.\" He is also an unlockable character along with providing commentary in the first ever TNA video game, \"TNA Impact!\".\n\nOn the December 14, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle put West in an ankle lock, making West pass out (kayfabe); he was replaced that night by Jim Cornette.\n\nDuring the Fish Market Street Fight between Curry Man & Shark Boy and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) at Destination X in 2008, he repeatedly made mention of the competitors creaming each other with a fish.\nOn the February 26, 2009 episode of \"Impact!\", West turned heel when he verbally assaulted and walked out on his commentary partner Tenay, leaving him to call the remainder of the show alone. The following week, West once again verbally assaulted Tenay, took the sides of heel wrestlers, and then once again walked out on Tenay. The week after that West showed up late, in a drunken state and again walked out on Tenay, after Tenay suggested West leave. Since then, West was back at the announcers table as a heel commentator. At the August 17, 2009, tapings of \"Impact!\" TNA removed West as a color commentator and replaced him with Taz. The company later announced that West had been promoted within the organization to oversee merchandise development and sales initiatives. On the October 15 edition of \"Impact!\" West returned as Amazing Red's new manager, turning face in the process. However, West's role of managing Red ended shortly thereafter. Since then, he has appeared mainly on TNA's internet programming and at house shows selling his merchandise. On May 28, 2012, it was reported that West had given his notice and would be leaving TNA shortly, having accepted an offer to become the new director of sales and marketing of Wenatchee, Washington based Wenatchee Wild ice hockey team.\n\nFrom 2001-2008, West hosted a daily mid-day sports talk show called \"The Sports Reporters\" on SportsRadio 560 WNSR AM in Nashville, Tennessee. The locally-aired program featured a rotation of different co-hosts from Nashville media (including David Boclair, Eric Yutzy, Steve Wrigley, and Paul Kuharsky), with each co-host appearing on a specific day of the week. The program covered sports topics of the day and ongoing local sports issues. However the show often shifted focus to additional topics, such as film, pop culture, and quite often \"hot chicks.\" The show achieved the top ratings spot for its timeslot, a considerable accomplishment for a sports-themed program airing on an AM station. The economic downturn of 2008, in conjunction with West's TNA Wrestling obligations (in the later years, tapings of TNA Wrestling made it impossible for West to host the program on Mondays), ultimately led to the demise of the show.\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Impact Wrestling revealed that West had joined the merchandise department. On June 15, 2017, Impact announced that West would return to the commentary team for their Slammiversary XV pay-per-view held Sunday July 2.\n\nHe is an Unlockable character in \"TNA IMPACT!\".\n\nWest has been married to his wife Terri West, since July 18, 1992.\n\n\n"}

The northern terminus is at US 52 in rural Clayton County near the towns of Monona and Farmersburg near the intersection of US 52 and US 18.\n\nIowa Highway 13 begins at U.S. 30 southeast of Cedar Rapids in an overlap with US 151 at a freeway interchange just east of the Cedar River. They go north as a divided highway through Bertram. They intersect Iowa Highway 100 at Marion and then separates from U.S. 151 in Marion as well. It continues north from Marion to Central City, where the divided highway ends. It goes north to Coggon, then turns east briefly before turning north again to go through Ryan. After passing through Ryan, it goes north to Manchester, where it intersects US 20. It continues north through Manchester and intersects Iowa 3.

{"id": "2248457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248457", "title": "Free Beer", "text": "Free Beer\n\nFree Beer, originally known as Vores øl - An open source beer (Danish for: \"Our Beer\"), is the first brand of beer with an \"open\"/\"free\" brand and recipe. The recipe and trademark elements are published under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA license.\n\nThe beer was created in 2004 by students at the IT University in Copenhagen together with artist collective Superflex, to illustrate how concepts of the FOSS movement might be applied outside the digital world. The \"Free Beer\" concept illustrates also the connection between the long tradition of freely sharing cooking recipes with the FOSS movement, which tries to establish this sharing tradition also for the \"recipes\" of software, the source code. The \"Free beer\" concept received an overall positive reception from international press and media for the political message, was presented on many exhibitions and conferences, and inspired many breweries in adopting the concept.\n\nIn December 2004, a group of IT University of Copenhagen students together with Superflex brewed a 100-liter batch of a dark heavy beer in their school's cafeteria. The group labeled the beer \"Vores øl\" (Danish for: \"Our Beer\"), after a 1994 Carlsberg beer advertisement slogan. A website was created to promote the project and the beer's recipe and label designs were published under an open source Creative Commons license, specifically the CC-BY-SA 2.5 license. Unlike software, cooking recipes aren't copyrightable, so the share-alike/copyleft licensing approach is legally questionable and untested in court.\nAfter the publication, the project received an overall positive reception from international press and media for the political message.\n\nThe developers of the beer stated that the beer was primarily a medium for the message of \"\"dogmatic notions of copyright and intellectual property that are dominating our culture\"\", and admitted that the group had only limited experience in beer production and was not made up of beer gurus.\nThe addition of the non-traditional beer ingredient Guaraná was also partly inspired politically by a previously in 2003 initiated Superflex project, \"Guaraná Power\", which focussed on the support of Brazilian guaraná farmers with Fair trade.\n\nAfter the first \"Vores Øl\" brewing of the open-source beer concept, Superflex continued to develop the concept under the name \"Free Beer\". A new colorful, unusual \"Free Beer\" artwork should create associations with the \"\"60's [artistic] liberation\"\" and underline the freedom aspect of the concept. The later name \"Free Beer\" is a play on Richard Stallman's common remark that free software is \"free as in speech, not free as in beer\", who suggested also the creation of \"Free software beer\" instead of an \"open source beer\".\n\nWhile the first \"Vores øl\" recipe drew some technical criticism, the recipe was continuously updated and identified shortcomings were fixed. Originally, the homebrewing community complained about the quality of the process and ingredient description. Remarks were that it was not stated how much water to use in the mash, what type of yeast was to be used, the style of beer being produced (other than being dark and heavy), whether or not any hops were being added for aroma, fermentation temperature, or how the beer was supposed to taste. Making reference to the technical problems of when software instructions (\"source code\") cannot be made into a functioning program, it was mentioned that if this recipe were source code, it would not compile. Because of the underlying theme of the group's message, the correction and development of this recipe is actively encouraged (in software terminology \"bug fixing and patches\").\n\nDue to the availability of the recipe and the many Free Beer brewings of breweries and individuals worldwide over the course of years, the recipe was updated several times. Later major Free Beer recipe iterations (v3.0 and 4.0) were also developed in collaboration with a local Danish and experienced brewery, Skands in Brøndby. As previous recipe shortcomings were corrected, for instance the amount of sugar was decreased by 90%, the quality of the beer improved significantly. The recipe's version, which has now reached 6.0 in 2017, illustrates the community's continuous collaborative improvement progress, made possible by the \"open source\" nature of Free Beer.\n\nUnder its free license, this free beer encourages others to tweak the recipe and redistribute it. Commercial or amateur brewers are able to reuse the recipe. Known derivatives include:\n\nOthers took the political idea of an \"open/free beer\" (not the \"Free Beer\" recipe and label), opened their own beer recipes and/or artwork, often under free licenses:\n\n\nSince its first presentation, the \"Free Beer\" concept was often reported by international printed and online media, and also discussed in specialist books regarding copyright.\n\nThe \"Free Beer\" project was also well received by the FOSS and open content movement, for instance by Richard Stallman, Cory Doctorow, and Lawrence Lessig. It was presented and sold on several technology conferences and meetings, for instance the \"Isummit 2008\" and the RMLL 2011, 2012, and 2014. The FSCONS 2008 resulted also in a CC-BY-SA licensed Ebook with the \"Free Beer\" artwork and title.\nFree Beer was shown also in the context of several art exhibitions and museums, for instance the Art Basel Miami Beach 2006, the Van Abbemuseum, Netherlands 2007 or the Taipei Biennial 2010 (sponsored by TTL). \"Free Beer\" was also used in the context of anti-copyright activities and movements, illustrating the advantage of open knowledge for the society.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248460", "title": "Love You To", "text": "Love You To\n\n\"Love You To\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1966 album \"Revolver\". The song was written and sung by George Harrison and features Indian instrumentation such as sitar and tabla. Following Harrison's introduction of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" in 1965, it was the first Beatles song to fully reflect the influence of Indian classical music. The recording was made with minimal participation from Harrison's bandmates; instead, he created the track with tabla player Anil Bhagwat and other Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle in London.\n\nThe composition adheres to the pitches of the Indian equivalent of Dorian mode and emulates the khyal vocal tradition of Hindustani classical music. For musical inspiration, Harrison drew from the work of master sitarist Ravi Shankar, who became his sitar tutor shortly after the recording was completed. In its lyrical themes, \"Love You To\" is partly a love song to Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, while also incorporating philosophical concepts inspired by his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. In the context of its release, the song served as one of the first examples of the Beatles expressing an ideology aligned with that of the emerging counterculture.\n\n\"Love You To\" has been hailed by musicologists and critics as groundbreaking in its presentation of a non-Western musical form to rock audiences, particularly with regard to authenticity and avoidance of parody. Author Jonathan Gould describes the song's slow sitar introduction as \"one of the most brazenly exotic acts of stylistic experimentation ever heard on a popular LP\". Ronnie Montrose, Bongwater, Jim James and Cornershop are among the artists who have covered \"Love You To\".\n\nOn the 1965 album \"Rubber Soul\", George Harrison had led the Beatles towards Indian classical music through his use of the Indian sitar on John Lennon's song \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\", while his own composition \"If I Needed Someone\" reflected the genre's influence in its melody and suggestion of drone. He subsequently wrote \"Love You To\" as a way to showcase the sitar, and to feature the tabla, a pair of Indian hand drums, for the first time. Music critic Richie Unterberger describes the song as the Beatles' \"first all-out excursion\" in raga rock,<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> a genre that author Nicholas Schaffner says was \"launched\" by Harrison's use of sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\".\n\nHarrison wrote \"Love You To\" in early 1966 while the Beatles were enjoying an unusually long period free of professional commitments, due to their inability to find a suitable film project. He used the available time to further explore his interest in Indian music and the sitar, which, journalist Maureen Cleave noted in a contemporary article, \"has given new meaning to [his] life\".<ref name=\"Cleave/Standard\"> Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).</ref> Aside from honeymooning in Barbados with his wife, English model Pattie Boyd, Harrison's activities included receiving sitar tuition from an Indian musician at the Asian Music Circle (AMC) in north London, where he also attended music recitals, and seeing Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar perform at the Royal Festival Hall. As reflected in \"Love You To\", Harrison continued to immerse himself in recordings by Shankar, who, when the pair met in June 1966, would agree to take Harrison as his student. This meeting took place at the home of the AMC's founders, Ayana and Patricia Angadi, whose network of friends and visitors added to Harrison's self-education in new forms of art, culture and politics.\n\nTypically of his songs over this period, Harrison was unable to commit to naming the new composition. At the start of the sessions for the Beatles' \"Revolver\" album, Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, gave the song the working title of \"Granny Smith\", after the variety of apple. The song was partly inspired by Harrison's experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD, which he credited as a catalyst for increased awareness and his interest in Eastern philosophical concepts. Author Ian MacDonald views the subject matter as \"part philosophical\" and \"part love-song\" to Boyd.\n\n\"Love You To\" is in the key of C and adheres to the pitches of Kafi thaat, the Indian equivalent of Dorian mode. The composition emulates the khyal vocal tradition of Hindustani (or North Indian) classical music. Structurally, it comprises an opening alap; a gat section, which serves as the main portion of the song; and a short drut (fast) gat to close the piece.\n\nThe alap consists of sitar played in free tempo, during which the song's melody is previewed in the style of an Indian raga. Described by Harrison biographer Simon Leng as \"essentially an adaptation of a blues lick\", the seven-note motif that closes the alap serves as a recurring motif during the ensuing gat. The change of metre following the alap marks the first such example in the Beatles' work; it would shortly be repeated in Lennon's composition \"She Said She Said\", which Harrison helped complete by joining together three separate pieces that Lennon had written.\nThe gat is set in madhya laya (medium tempo) and features a driving rock rhythm accentuated by heavy tambura drone. This portion of the composition consists of eight-bar \"A\" sections and twelve-bar \"B\" sections, structured in an A-B-A-B pattern. The alap's lack of a distinct time signature is contrasted with a temporal reference in the lyrics to the opening verse: \"Each day just goes so fast / I turn around, it's past\". Throughout, the vocal line avoids the melodic embellishment typical of khyal, apart from the use of melisma over the last line in each of the A sections. In keeping with the minimal harmonic movement of Indian music, the composition's only deviation from its I chord of C is a series of implied VII chord changes, which occur in the B sections.\n\nDuring the mid-song instrumental passage, the melody line of the sitar incorporates aspects of the alap, raising the melody previewed there by an octave. The song then returns to verses sung over the A and B sections, culminating in the line \"I'll make love to you, if you want me to.\" The arrival of the drut gat follows Hindustani convention by ending the composition at an accelerated tempo, although the brevity of this segment marks a departure from the same tradition.\n\nAs with all of the songs written by Harrison or Lennon and recorded by the Beatles in 1966, the lyrics to \"Love You To\" marked a departure from the standard love-song themes that had defined the group's previous work. Harrison presents a worldview that variously reflects cynicism, sardonic humour and a degree of detachment with regard to personal relationships. According to music critic John Harris, the lines \"There's people standing round / Who'll screw you in the ground / They'll fill you in with all the sins you'll see\" serve as one of the first examples of the Beatles' ideology aligning with that of the emerging 1960s counterculture, by highlighting the division between traditional mores and an LSD-inspired perspective. Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc recognise this and other statements in \"Love You To\" as part of the Beatles' espousal of anti-materialism from 1966 onwards, a message that, inspired by the LSD experience, suggested a \"psychedelic vision of society\".\n\nAmong other commentators discussing the lyrical themes, Mark Hertsgaard writes that Harrison's \"response to the fleetingness of time was to affirm and celebrate life: 'make love all day long / make love singing songs'\", while Robert Rodriguez describes \"Love You To\" as \"a somewhat oblique expression of love directed toward his bride, along with larger concerns regarding mortality and purpose\". In Ian Inglis' estimation, the lyrics \"remind us that in a world of material dissatisfaction and moral disharmony, there is always the solace of sexual pleasure\".\n\n\"Love You To\" was the third track the Beatles recorded for \"Revolver\", after \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Got to Get You into My Life\". Rodriguez comments that \"Love You To\" \"[made] explicit the Indian influence implicit throughout the entire album\", as songs such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Got to Get You into My Life\", together with the non-album single tracks \"Paperback Writer\" and \"Rain\", all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display the limited harmonic movement that typifies the genre. In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: \"We were listening to all sorts of things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, and most of it made its way onto our records.\"\n\nThe basic track for \"Love You To\" was taped in London at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) on 11 April 1966. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, Harrison initially sang and played acoustic guitar, accompanied by Paul McCartney on backing vocals. By the end of the first session that day, three takes of the song had been made, with Harrison introducing his sitar on the last of these takes. Work resumed at 8 pm, with the participation of Anil Bhagwat, a tabla player that Harrison had sourced through Patricia Angadi. Other outside contributors, also from the AMC, included musicians on tambura and sitar.\n\nAccording to Inglis, \"Love You To\" is \"defined\" by the interplay between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later recalled of his involvement: \"George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation.\" After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.\nWith take 6 selected as the best performance, a reduction mix was carried out on 13 April, freeing up space for more overdubs on the four-track tape. Harrison added another vocal part onto what was now referred to as take 7, and Ringo Starr played tambourine. McCartney contributed a high harmony vocal over the words \"They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see\", but this part was omitted from the final mix. Harrison also overdubbed fuzz-tone electric guitar,<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> controlling the output via a volume pedal. Producer Tony Visconti has marvelled at the guitar sounds the Beatles introduced on \"Revolver\", particularly Harrison's part on \"Love You To\", which he says \"sounds like a chainsaw cutting down a tree in Vermont\".\n\nCredit for the main sitar part on \"Love You To\" has traditionally been the subject of debate among commentators. While MacDonald says that, rather than Harrison, it was the sitarist from the AMC who played this part, Rodriguez writes that \"others point to [Harrison's] single-minded diligence in mastering the instrument, as well as his study through private lessons, proximity to accomplished musicians, and close listening to pertinent records.\" In his official history of the Beatles' recording career, \"The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions\", Lewisohn states: \"George played the sitar but an outside musician, Anil Bhagwat, was recruited to play the tabla.\" Musicologist Walter Everett also identifies Harrison as the main sitar player on the recording, as does Peter Lavezzoli, author of \"The Dawn of Indian Music in the West\". Leng comments that, as on \"Norwegian Wood\", Harrison \"is still playing the sitar like a guitar player [on the recording], using blues and rock 'n' roll bends rather than the intensely intricate Indian equivalents\". Speaking to author Steve Turner, Bhagwat has dismissed the idea that the sitarist was not Harrison, saying: \"I can tell you here and now – 100 percent it was George on sitar throughout.\"\n\nFinal mixing for the song took place on 21 June as the Beatles rushed to complete \"Revolver\" before beginning the first leg of their 1966 world tour. Harrison discussed \"Love You To\" with Shankar when the two musicians met that month, at a social event hosted by the Angadi family. Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had yet to hear \"Norwegian Wood\", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely \"experiments\". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: \"I felt I wanted to walk out of my home that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta. I would even have left Pattie behind in that moment.\"\n\"Revolver\" was released on 5 August 1966, with \"Love You To\" sequenced as the fourth track. In advance of the release, EMI had issued the songs to radio stations throughout July, in increments, to prepare the Beatles' audience for the progression the band had made with their latest work. According to cultural historian Simon Philo, the album represented \"pop's most sustained deployment of Indian instruments, musical form and even religious philosophy thus far – which all came together most notably on ['Love You To']\". By that point, the Beatles' association with Indian music had been firmly established, after, at Harrison's suggestion, the band stopped over in Delhi on the return flight from their concerts in the Far East. During the highly publicised visit, all four members of the group bought musical instruments from Rikhi Ram & Sons in Connaught Place. Bhagwat's name appeared on the LP's back cover, one of the few times that an outside musician received an official credit on a Beatles album.\nAmong commentators recalling the song's release, Barry Miles describes \"Love You To\" as having \"sounded astonishing next to the electrifying pop of the \"Revolver\" album\". Hertsgaard writes: \"what caught most people's interest was the exotic rhythm track. The opening descent of shimmering harplike notes beckoned even those who resisted Indian music, while the lyrics melded the mysticism of the East ... with the pragmatism of the West, and the hedonism of youth culture.\"\n\nIn his 1977 book \"The Beatles Forever\", Schaffner wrote that, next to the dominant Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership, Harrison's three compositions on \"Revolver\" – \"Love You To\", \"Taxman\" and \"I Want to Tell You\" – \"offered ample indication that there were now three prolific songwriting Beatles\". Schaffner also commented that, through his championing of the sitar and Shankar's music, Harrison came to be seen as \"the maharaja of raga-rock\" among Western musicians. In the Beatles' 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", a brief portion of the song is used to introduce Harrison's character, as a guru-like figure, standing on a hill.\n\nIn a joint album review with Peter Jones for \"Record Mirror\", Richard Green enthused about \"Love You To\", saying: \"Starts like a classical Indian recital ... This is great. So different. Play it again! Best [track] so far.\" Allen Evans of the \"NME\" said the song had a \"Kama Sutra-type lyric\" and lauded Harrison's sitar playing as \"stunning\" and \"tremendous\" before concluding: \"Fascinating mixture of minor melody with Indian accompaniment. One of the most striking tracks.\" In his role as guest reviewer for \"Disc and Music Echo\", Ray Davies of the Kinks also admired the performance and suggested that Harrison \"must have quite a big influence on the group now\".\n\nWriting in the recently launched \"Crawdaddy!\", Paul Williams \"heaped praise\" on \"Love You To\", according to Rodriguez, while critic Lester Bangs termed it \"the first injection of ersatz Eastern wisdom into rock\". The majority of contemporary US reviews were lukewarm towards \"Revolver\", however, in reaction to the publication of Lennon's comment to Maureen Cleave that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. An exception was New York critic Richard Goldstein, who praised the album as \"a revolutionary record\", and later wrote that the song's lyrics \"exploded with a passionate sutra quality\". While bemoaning the initial lack of recognition for \"Revolver\", \"KRLA Beat\"s reviewer said that Harrison had \"created a new extension of the music form which he introduced in \"Rubber Soul\"\", and described \"Love You To\" as \"Well done and musically valid. Also musically unrecognized.\"\n\nWriting in the journal \"Asian Music\", ethnomusicologist David Reck has cited \"Love You To\" as being revolutionary in Western culture, adding: \"One cannot emphasise how absolutely unprecedented this piece is in the history of popular music. For the first time an Asian music was not parodied utilising familiar stereotypes and misconceptions, but rather transferred in toto into a new environment with sympathy and rare understanding.\" Reck views it as the first in \"a series of finely crafted Indian-based songs\" by Harrison that would extend through his solo career, and while admiring the range of authentic Hindustani musical elements in the composition, he concludes: \"All of this in a three-minute song!\" Peter Lavezzoli describes \"Love You To\" as \"the first conscious attempt in pop to emulate a non-Western form of music in structure and instrumentation\", while Reck calls it \"the first song in the Euro-American pop music canon that is scored predominantly for Asian musical instruments, [with] sitar, tabla and tambura replacing rock band guitars, keyboards, bass and drums\". Lavezzoli says of the sitar part: \"[Harrison's] playing throughout the song is an astonishing improvement over 'Norwegian Wood'. In fact, 'Love You To' remains the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician.\"\n\n\"Love You To\" has been recognised as a precursor to the world music genre. Through the success of \"Revolver\" in 1966, it was a key factor in the rise in popularity of Indian classical music among contemporary Western youth. In addition, the song inspired other rock musicians to experiment with non-Western instruments and tones, and so helped expand the scope of raga rock, while its mix of Indian instrumentation and distorted electric guitar was highly influential in the development of 1960s psychedelic music.\n\nReviewing Harrison's musical career in a 2002 issue of \"Goldmine\" magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that \"Love You To\" \"opened creative doors through which Harrison's bandmates may not – and [George] Martin certainly would not – have ever dreamed of passing\". \"Rolling Stone\" contributor Greg Kot pairs it with \"Taxman\" as two \"major contributions\" that saw Harrison \"[come] into his own as a songwriter\" on \"Revolver\". Kot describes \"Love You To\" as \"a boldly experimental track\" and \"the first full-scale incorporation of Eastern instruments on a Beatles album\". Writing on his music website \"Elsewhere\", Graham Reid views the song as a \"classic\" due to its standing as \"arguably the first in Western pop ... which owes nothing to pop music traditions. It is an Indian song in its structure and execution.\"\n\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \"Love You To\" to be Harrison's \"first and best foray into Indian music\", while Bruce Eder, also writing for AllMusic, views it as \"exquisite\". In his song review for the same website, Richie Unterberger is unimpressed with the track; while acknowledging that \"Love You To\" was \"Undoubtedly ... another indication of the group's rapidly broadening barriers\", he cites a lead vocal that \"drone[s] on in a rather lugubrious way\", Harrison's slightly \"disheveled\" sitar playing, and lyrics that constitute \"a rather muddled mix of free love advocacy, meditations on the transience of life on Earth, and chip-on-the-shoulder wariness of people out to exploit him\". Although he finds the melody \"sourly repetitious\", Ian MacDonald writes that the track is \"distinguished by the authenticity of its Hindustani classical instrumentation and techniques\", and admires Harrison's understanding of the genre. In a 2009 review for \"Paste\" magazine, Mark Kemp described \"Revolver\" as the album on which the Beatles \"completed their transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers\", and added: \"Harrison's 'Love You To' is pure Indian raga – sitar and tablas punctuated by the occasional luminous guitar riff jolting through the song's paranoid, drug-fueled lyrics like a blinding ray of sun into a dark forest.\"\n\nThe Trypes, an offshoot of the Feelies, covered \"Love You To\" on their 1984 EP \"The Explorers Hold\". A version by Ronnie Montrose, titled \"Love to You\" and including a rare vocal performance by the guitarist, appeared on his album \"Territory\" in 1986. The song was covered by experimental rock band Bongwater in 1988 on their debut album \"Double Bummer\".\n\nMy Morning Jacket singer Jim James performed \"Love You To\" on a banjo for his 2009 EP \"Tribute To\", a collection of Harrison songs that James recorded shortly after the former Beatle's death in November 2001. In 2011, Solid Gold covered the song on the \"Minnesota Beatle Project, Vol. 3\" compilation. The following year, Cornershop recorded it for \"Yellow Submarine Resurfaces\", a multi-artist compilation issued by \"Mojo\" magazine.\n\nAccording to Kenneth Womack and Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

The station is unique in that it does not have its own entrance halls. The north escalator leads to Okhotniy Ryad and the south escalator to Ploshchad Revolyutsii.\n\nPloshchad Sverdlova station opened on September 11, 1938 as part of the second stage of construction of the Moscow Metro system. It was the terminal station of the Zamoskvoretskaya line until the line was extended on January 1, 1943. Teatralnaya's architect was Ivan Fomin. The station is located at a depth of 33.9 meters (111 ft). The central hall has a diameter of 9.5 meters (31 ft), with an 8.5 meter (28 ft) lateral lining of cast-iron tubing.\n\nFrom its opening until 1990, the station's name was Ploshchad Sverdlova, which was named in honor of the prominent Bolshevik, Yakov Sverdlov. In 1990, the city changed the name of the square to Teatralnaya Ploshchad. The name of the station followed accordingly.\n\nTeatralnaya Station has fluted pylons faced with labradorite and white marble taken from the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Crystal lamps in bronze frames attached to the center of the room give the central hall a festive appearance. The vault of the central hall is decorated with caissons and majolica bas-reliefs by Natyla Danko on the theme of theatre arts of the USSR, manufactured by Leningrad Porcelain Factory. These bas-reliefs are a series of fourteen different figures, each representing music and dance from various nationalities of the Soviet Union. Seven male and seven female figures attired in their national costumes are either performing an ethnic dance or are playing a distinctively ethnic musical instrument. The series included Armenia, Byelorussia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Each figure is reproduced four times for a total of 56 figures. Initially, the floor was of black-and-yellow granite patterned as a chessboard; however in 1970, the yellow panels were replaced with gray.\n\nA bust of Yakov Sverdlov, for whom the station was originally named, was located at the end of the platform opposite the escalators. Only the base remains today. A bust of Vladimir Lenin was however, preserved.\n\nFrom this station it is possible to transfer to Okhotniy Ryad on the Sokolnicheskaya Line and Ploshchad Revolyutsii on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2248471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248471", "title": "She Said She Said", "text": "She Said She Said\n\n\"She Said She Said\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1966 album \"Revolver\". Credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was written by John Lennon with assistance from George Harrison. Lennon described it as \"an 'acidy' song\" with lyrics inspired by actor Peter Fonda's comments during an LSD trip in August 1965 with members of the Beatles and the Byrds. \"She Said She Said\" was the last track recorded for \"Revolver\". Due to an argument over the song's musical arrangement, Paul McCartney walked out of the studio and did not contribute to the recording.\n\nIn late August 1965, Brian Epstein had rented a house at 2850 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills, California for the Beatles' six-day respite from their US tour. The large Spanish-style house was hidden within the side of a mountain. Soon their address became widely known and the area was besieged by fans, who blocked roads and tried to scale the steep canyon while others rented helicopters to spy from overhead. The police department detailed a tactical squad of officers to protect the band and the house. The Beatles found it impossible to leave and instead invited guests, including actor Eleanor Bron (their co-star in the film \"Help!\") and folk singer Joan Baez. On 24 August, they hosted Roger McGuinn and David Crosby of the Byrds and actor Peter Fonda.\n\nHaving first taken LSD (or \"acid\") in March that year, John Lennon and George Harrison were determined that Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr should join them on their next experience of the drug. Harrison later said that the heightened perception induced by LSD had been so powerful that he and Lennon had not been able to \"relate\" to McCartney and Starr since then, adding: \"Not just on the one level – we couldn't relate to them on \"any\" level, because acid had changed us so much.\" At the party, the issue of taking LSD thereby became important to maintain band unity. While Starr agreed to try the drug, McCartney refused to partake.\n\nFonda wrote for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine:\n\nAs the group passed time in the large sunken tub in the bathroom, Fonda brought up his nearly fatal self-inflicted childhood gunshot accident, writing later that he was trying to comfort Harrison, who was overcome by fear that he might be dying. Fonda said that he knew what it was like to be dead, since he had technically died in the operating theatre. Lennon urged him to drop the subject, saying \"Who put all that shit in your head?\" and \"You're making me feel like I've never been born.\" Harrison recalls in \"The Beatles Anthology\": \"[Fonda] was showing us his bullet wound. He was very uncool.\" Lennon explained in a 1980 interview:\n\nLennon eventually asked Fonda to leave the party. After this, the gathering settled down as Lennon, Harrison, McGuinn and Crosby sat in the large bathtub discussing their shared interest in Indian classical music. Crosby demonstrated raga scales on an acoustic guitar and recommended that Harrison investigate the recordings of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar. Peter Brown, Epstein's assistant, later wrote that, in addition to inspiring Lennon's 1966 song \"She Said She Said\", the band members' \"LSD experiment\" in August 1965 \"marked the unheralded beginning of a new era for the Beatles\". Author George Case, writing in his book \"Out of Our Heads\", describes the Beatles' subsequent album, \"Rubber Soul\", and its 1966 follow-up, \"Revolver\", as \"the authentic beginning of the psychedelic era\".\n\nLennon began working on \"She Said She Said\" in March 1966, shortly before the Beatles started recording \"Revolver\". On the home recordings he made at this time, the song was titled \"He Said\" and performed on acoustic guitar. Lennon said that the episode with Fonda had stuck with him, and when writing the song, \"I changed it to 'she' instead of 'he.'\" Harrison recalled helping Lennon construct the song from \"maybe three\" separate segments that Lennon had. Harrison described the process as \"a real weld\". In his 2017 book \"Who Wrote the Beatle Songs?\", author Todd Compton credits Lennon and Harrison as the song's true composers.\n\n\"She Said She Said\" is in the key of B Mixolydian, based on three chords: B (I), A (VII), and E (IV). The key centre shifts to E major during the bridge sections by means of an F minor (v) chord, a pivot chord that the Beatles had used to modulate to the subdominant before on \"From Me to You\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". The coda features a canonic imitation in the voice parts, a development of the idea originally presented by Harrison's lead guitar in the verse. Lennon's Hammond organ part consists entirely of one note – a tonic B-flat held throughout and faded in and out.\n\nThe track incorporates a change of metre, following Harrison's introduction of such a musical device into the Beatles' work with his Indian-styled composition \"Love You To\". \"She Said She Said\" uses both 3/4 and 4/4 time, shifting to 3/4 on the line \"No, no, no, you're wrong\" and back again on \"I said …\" The middle part consists of another song fragment that Lennon had penned. At Harrison's suggestion, Lennon used this fragment in the middle of \"She Said She Said\". In this section, the subject of Lennon's lyrics changes from his recollection of the LSD episode with Fonda to a reminiscence of childhood, as Lennon sings: \"When I was a boy everything was right / Everything was right\". According to musicologist Walter Everett, this abstraction is Lennon's refuge from the disturbing sensation that he's \"never been born\", and the change in time signature to 3/4 serves as an appropriate device for the shift in lyrical focus back in time. Musicologist Alan Pollack comments that, typically of the Beatles' work, the song's experimental qualities – rhythm, meter, lyrics, and sound treatment on the official recording – are tempered effectively by the band's adherence to a recognisable musical form. In this case, the structure comprises two verses, two bridge sections separated by a single verse, followed by a final verse and an outro (or coda).<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref>\n\nIn his commentary on \"She Said She Said\", music critic Tim Riley writes that the song conveys the \"primal urge\" for innocence, which imbues the lyric with \"complexity\", as the speaker suffers through feelings of \"inadequacy\", \"helplessness\" and \"profound fear\". In Riley's opinion, the track's \"intensity is palpable\" and \"the music is a direct connection to [Lennon's] psyche\"; he adds that \"at the core of Lennon's pain is a bottomless sense of abandonment\", a theme that the singer would return to in late 1966 with \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\n\"She Said, She Said\" was the final track recorded during the \"Revolver\" sessions. It was also the first composition that Lennon had brought to the band in almost two months, since \"I'm Only Sleeping\". Because of Lennon's lack of productivity, Harrison was afforded a rare opportunity to have a third song, \"I Want to Tell You\", included on a Beatles album. The session took place on 21 June 1966, two days before the Beatles had to leave for West Germany to begin the first leg of their 1966 world tour. It took nine hours to rehearse and record, complete with overdubs, making it the only song on \"Revolver\" to be made in a single session. After the subsequent mixing session, the Beatles' producer, George Martin, said: \"All right, boys, I'm just going for a lie-down.\"\n\nThe creative cooperation among the four Beatles was at its highest during the \"Revolver\" period.<ref name=\"Sheffield/RS 50th\"></ref> There nevertheless remained a philosophical divide between McCartney and Lennon, Harrison and Starr due to McCartney's refusal to try LSD. McCartney took part in the rehearsals for \"She Said She Said\" but did not contribute to the finished recording. He recalled: \"I think we had a barney or something and I said, 'Oh, fuck you!,' and they said, 'Well, we'll do it.' I think George played bass.\" Harrison played a Burns bass guitar, which he had used earlier in the sessions during initial recording for \"Paperback Writer\". Harrison then contributed the lead guitar part, incorporating an Indian quality in its sound and providing an introduction that Riley describes as \"outwardly harnessed, but inwardly raging\". Case describes the recording as \"a metallic spiral of guitar and drums as aggressive as anything by the Who or the Yardbirds\".\n\nIn his 2012 book on the making of \"Revolver\", Robert Rodriguez highlights McCartney's walkout as one of \"a handful of unsolved Beatles mysteries\". When identifying the probable causes for McCartney's uncharacteristic behaviour, Rodriguez cites later comments made by Lennon: specifically that Lennon appreciated Harrison's tendency to \"take it as-is\" whereas McCartney often took a musical arrangement in a direction he himself preferred; and that, given Lennon and Harrison's habit of teasing their bandmate over his refusal to take LSD, McCartney possibly felt alienated by the song's subject matter. Lennon expressed satisfaction with the completed track, adding, \"The guitars are great on it.\"\n\nEMI's Parlophone label released \"Revolver\" on 5 August 1966, one week before the Beatles began their final North American tour. \"She Said She Said\" was sequenced as the last track on side one of the LP, following \"Yellow Submarine\". Actress Salli Sachse, who appeared with Fonda in the 1967 film \"The Trip\", recalled of his reaction to the release: \"Peter was really into music. He couldn't wait until The Beatles' \"Revolver\" album came out. We went to the music store and played it, trying to hear any hidden messages.\" Writing in 2017, Alec Wilkinson of \"The New Yorker\" said that \"She Said She Said\" introduced \"circumstances novel to western awareness\", a theme that had \"no obvious antecedent or reference\" in pop music. As with much of the album, the song confused many of the band's younger or less-progressive fans. According to sociologist Candy Leonard: \"For two and a half minutes they heard John recounting an impassioned conversation about something that seemed very important but totally incomprehensible. And the echoing guitar riff is a full participant in the conversation. Fans were bewildered.\"\n\nThe song was an early example of acid rock, a genre that came to the fore in Britain and America in the wake of \"Revolver\". In his book on the Swinging London phenomenon, Shawn Levy identifies the album's \"trio of tuned-in, blissed-out, spiked and spaced tunes\" by Lennon – \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", \"She Said She Said\" and \"I'm Only Sleeping\" – as especially indicative of the Beatles' transformation into \"the world's first household psychedelics, avatars of something wilder and more revolutionary than anything pop culture had ever delivered before\". \"Rolling Stone\" attributes the development of the Los Angeles and San Francisco music scenes, including subsequent releases by the Beach Boys, Love and the Grateful Dead, to the influence of \"Revolver\", particularly the \"conjunction of melodic immediacy and acid-fueled mind games\" in \"She Said She Said\". The song was much admired by American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. In his 1967 television special \"\", he described it as a \"remarkable song\" and demonstrated its shift in time signature as an example of the Beatles' talent for inventive and unexpected musical devices in their work.\n\nStarr's drumming on \"She Said She Said\" is often included among his best performances. Author and critic Ian MacDonald rated the drumming as \"technically finer than that of [Starr's] other tour-de-force, 'Rain'\". In 1988, home recordings of Lennon developing the song were broadcast on the Westwood One radio show \"The Lost Lennon Tapes\". A cassette containing 25 minutes of these recordings, which Lennon had given to Tony Cox, the former husband of his second wife, Yoko Ono, in January 1970, was auctioned at Christie's in London in April 2002.\n\n\"She Said She Said\" was included on the Beatles' 2012 iTunes compilation \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", which the band's website described as a collection of \"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\". It has been covered by the following acts, among others: Lone Star, Ween, the Black Keys, Matthew Sweet, Gov't Mule, the Feelies, Tom Newman, the Chords, Snake River Conspiracy, Mark Mulcahy, the Walking Seeds and Yeah Yeah Noh. Cheap Trick performed it as part of \"The Howard Stern Show\"s tribute to \"Revolver\" in 2016. In 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked \"She Said She Said\" at number 19 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n\n"}

(), in the People's Republic of China.\n\nWhite Rabbit Creamy Candy is white, with a soft, chewy texture, and is formed into cylinders approximately 3 cm long and 1 cm in diameter, similar to contemporary western nougat or taffy. \n\nEach candy is wrapped in a printed waxed paper wrapper, but within this, the sticky candies are again wrapped in a thin edible paper-like wrapping made from sticky rice. The rice wrapping layer is meant to be eaten along with the rest of the candy and can be found in the list of ingredients in the UK as \"Edible Glutinous Rice Paper (edible starch, water, Glycerin Monostearate)\" along with liquid maltose, white granulated sugar, whole milk powder, butter, food additives (gelatin, vanillin), corn starch, syrup, cane sugar and milk. Each candy contains 20 calories.\n\nWhite Rabbit sweets have been advertised with the slogan, \"Seven White Rabbit candies is equivalent to one cup of milk\" and positioned as a nutritional product in addition to being a sweet. The candies hence accompanied the growth of a generation. Former students of the early Deng Xiaoping era in China (1978 to the early 1990s), have been reported to have taken this slogan literally and made 'hot milk' in their dormitory cooking rings by dissolving the candies in a pan of hot water.\n\nIn addition to the original vanilla flavour, new flavours such as chocolate, coffee, toffee, peanut, maize, coconut, lychee, strawberry, mango, red bean, yogurt, matcha, and fruit have been added. The butter-plum flavour, characteristic of China, was also among the new flavours added through the years.\n\nWhite Rabbit Creamy Candy originated at the ABC Candy Factory of Shanghai in 1943, when a merchant from ABC tried a milk candy from England and thought that the taste of the candy was not bad. After half a year of development, he then manufactured the factory's own brand of milk candies.\n\nThe first ABC milk candies were packaged using a red Mickey Mouse drawing on the label, and were named ABC Mickey Mouse Sweets. As their prices were lower than imported products, they became widely popular among the people.\n\nIn the 1950s, ABC became state-owned during the revolution. Mickey Mouse was seen as a symbol for worshipping foreign countries, so the packaging was redesigned to feature a naturalistically-drawn White Rabbit and an artist's paint palette with Chinese and English hand-lettering in a color scheme of red, blue and black against a white background. The result was a distinctive candy label design that became instantly recognizable around the world. The packaging and brand logo have changed over the years: When the candies were first marketed, the White Rabbit on the outer packaging was lying down; however, this was changed to an image of the rabbit jumping. Currently, the trade mark animal on the outer packaging has been given enormous neotenic, forward-facing eyes in the style of Disney or Japanese anime, while the inner wrapping retains its classic art deco look and naturalistic rabbit.\n\nInitially, production of the candies was capped at 800 kg per day, and they were manually produced. In 1959, these candies were given as gifts for the tenth National Day of the China. In 1972, Premier Zhou Enlai used White Rabbit candies as a gift to American president, Richard Nixon, when he visited China. Today, White Rabbit candies are China's top brand of sweet.\n\nAlthough the White Rabbit brand already had some history, its popularity worldwide has grown with the economy of China. Cities and agricultural villages' demands are increasing, especially during the Chinese New Year period, when many families provide White Rabbit sweets among other candies for visitors. In 2004, White Rabbit candy sales hit 600 million yuan, with sales increasing rapidly by a double-digit percentage yearly. The candies are now exported to more than forty countries and territories, including the United States, Europe and Singapore. On December 2, 2017, Wong's Ice Cream of Toronto, Canada unveiled the first ice cream flavour made from White Rabbit Candy.\n\nThe White Rabbit brand was transferred to Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Co., Ltd. in November 1997. The United States distributor of the candy is Queensway Foods, in San Francisco, California.\n\nIn July 2007, the Philippine Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) said that four imported foods made in China contained formalin and should be recalled. Those listed were White Rabbit Creamy Candy, Milk Candy, Balron Grape Biscuits, and Yong Kang Foods Grape Biscuits. White Rabbit said that counterfeit candies, known to exist in the Philippines, might have been the true culprits, and cited an independent report by the Shanghai affiliate of the Swiss-based SGS Group, the world's largest inspection and testing company, as saying that samples of candy ready to be exported overseas contained no toxic substances. In Singapore, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) also stated after conducting tests that the candy was safe for consumption. However, on July 24, 2007, the local Philippine distributor of White Rabbit bowed to the BFAD recall order. BFAD officials gave the distributor 15 days to implement the recall.\n\nOn July 24, 2007, National Agency of Drug and Food Control of Republic of Indonesia stated that 39 imported foods made in China, including White Rabbit Creamy Candy sold in Jakarta, contained formaldehyde, and sealed them for destruction. It urged the public not to consume these products. On August 9, 2007, Indonesia said samples of White Rabbit Creamy Candy sold in Palembang and Mataram also contained formaldehyde and took similar actions.\n\nIn September 2008, there were more than 52,000 reported cases of children made sick by melamine-tainted dairy products in China. Most of the children were diagnosed with kidney problems. White Rabbit Creamy Candy was listed among the many milk-based food products made in China that were contaminated with melamine and was removed from store shelves. The same form of contamination was responsible for the Chinese melamine pet food contamination scandal in 2007, during which thousands of pet dogs and cats died of kidney failure after eating pet food that contained melamine.\n\nOn September 24, 2008, the UK supermarket chain Tesco pulled all White Rabbit Creamy Candy from their shelves \"as a precaution\" in response to the melamine-contamination reports. The Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety issued an advisory on the product after it tested positive for melamine in their laboratories, with more than six times the legal limit for the chemical.\n\nWhen White Rabbit candy was returned to export in 2009, it also underwent a name change to Golden Rabbit Creamy Candy. Aside from avoiding the marketing stigma associated with the tarnished White Rabbit name, the Golden Rabbit candy is made using milk from Australia instead of China. Original White Rabbit is also being manufactured, with milk coming from New Zealand.\n\n\n"}

It was written mainly by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Leonard Bernstein praised the song for its construction in a 1967 CBS News documentary. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said the song \"radiates optimism and good vibes.\" Ian MacDonald said it is \"superbly sung by McCartney and exquisitely produced by George Martin and his team\" and that it shows the Beatles \"at their effortless best.\"\n\nThe song was recorded on 8 June 1966, with overdubs added the following day. McCartney sang the lead vocal and played piano, accompanied by Ringo Starr on drums, and then overdubbed the bass guitar. Music critic Ian MacDonald was unsure if John Lennon played guitar on the track; in his description of the recording sessions for the song, Mark Lewisohn did not mention a guitar track. Lennon and George Harrison add harmony vocals during the choruses. Lennon can be barely heard repeating \"she feels good\" after McCartney at 1:27. George Martin played the piano solo, recorded with the tape recorder running slower than usual and thus in the released version the solo sounds faster than it was actually played. When it was mixed in mono, the drums accidentally played during the fadeout. The stereo mix repaired the mistake.\n\nLike \"She Said She Said\" the song closes with an imitative canon in the voices.\n\nMcCartney said that he was influenced by the Lovin' Spoonful: the song's \"old-timey vaudevillian feel\" particularly recalls the Spoonful's hit \"Daydream\", to which \"Good Day Sunshine\" bears some harmonic resemblance.\n\n\n\n(*) MacDonald was unsure if Lennon played guitar on the track.\n"}

Population: 33,500 (1968).\n\nIt was previously known as \"Sol-na-Gorodtse\".\n\nIt was founded in 1474 as Sol-na-Gorodtse (). After the Khan of Kazan razed it to the ground in 1536, a wooden fort was constructed to protect the settlement against further Tatar incursions. For the following three centuries, Balakhna prospered as a center of saltworks and grain trade. By the Time of Troubles, it was the twelfth largest city in Russia.\n\nAdam Olearius visited and described the town in 1636. That year several shipwrights from Holstein built the first Russian ships here, thus establishing Balakhna as a foremost center of national river shipbuilding. The people of Balakhna were also reputed for their skills in knitting and making colored tiles, which were used for decoration of the Savior Church (1668) and other local temples. Balakhna is one of the few Russian cities shown on the (labeled \"Balaghna\").\n\nThe northwestern part of Balakhna is known as Pravdinsk. It used to be a separate urban-type settlement before it was merged into Balakhna in 1993. The settlement was named after the Moscow Pravda newspaper, which at some point may have been the largest consumer of newsprint produced at the local paper mill.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Balakhna serves as the administrative center of Balakhninsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Balakhninsky District as the town of district significance of Balakhna.

Of all the tentlike churches built in brick, this is the nearest approach to their wooden prototypes. Another church, dating from the 17th century, houses a municipal museum. The Nativity church (1675) represents an archaic monumental type of monastery cathedral.

{"id": "2248489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248489", "title": "Doctor Robert", "text": "Doctor Robert\n\n\"Doctor Robert\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released in 1966 on their album \"Revolver\", apart from in North America, where it instead appeared on their \"Yesterday and Today\" Album. The song was written by John Lennon (and credited to Lennon–McCartney), although Paul McCartney has said that he co-wrote it. The Beatles recorded the track in seven takes on 17 April 1966, with vocals overdubbed on 19 April.\n\nAccording to musicologist Walter Everett, the lyrics to \"Doctor Robert\" \"contained the most overt drug references of any published Beatles song\" up to 1966, and he adds that in their recording of the song, the band \"found musical ways to portray the doctor as a saint\". The character is in keeping with the idea of a \"Dr. Feelgood\", a physician who prescribed drugs such as amphetamines under the guise of legitimate medical practice. Lennon recalled that McCartney might have helped him write the \"Well, well, well\" bridge; despite this, according to music journalist Robert Fontenot, \"most agree the song is almost all John's brainchild.\"\nIn his book \"Beatles '66\", author Steve Turner says that Lennon was possibly encouraged to write about a drug supplier after discussing \"Mother's Little Helper\" – a song from the Rolling Stones' just-released \"Aftermath\" album – with Mick Jagger, when the latter had attended a recent session for \"Revolver\". Turner cites Donovan's 1965 track \"Candy Man\" as another song that might have served as an example for Lennon. According to his friend Pete Shotton, when Lennon played him the acetate of \"Doctor Robert\", \"he seemed beside himself with glee over the prospect of millions of record buyers innocently singing along.\"\n\nMultiple theories have circulated about the identity of the real Dr Robert. Author Barry Miles identified him as Dr. Robert Freymann, a New York doctor known for dispensing vitamin B-12 shots laced with amphetamines to wealthy clientele. Aged around 60 in 1966, Freymann was a German-born Manhattan physician known to New York's artists and wealthier citizens for his vitamin B-12 injections, which also featured liberal doses of amphetamine. Freymann bragged that he could rattle off 100 names of his celebrity patients (reportedly including Jackie Kennedy) \"in 10 minutes\".\n\nTurner, who also identifies Freymann as Dr. Robert, writes that \"some in the Beatles' circle thought Dr. Robert was a reference to Robert Fraser\" – an art gallery owner, \"reliable source of pot and cocaine for London's hip set\", and friend of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In a 1980 interview that Fontenot says \"muddied the issue further\", Lennon said the song was \"Mainly about drugs and pills\" but: \"It was about myself. I was the one that carried all the pills on tour.\"\n\nIn a 2009 article for the \"Spinner\" website, James Sullivan listed three other people who were speculated to be the real-life Dr Robert:\n\n\"Doctor Robert\" uses the keys of A major and B major, and its melody is in the Mixolydian mode based on B. The musical arrangement has staggered layering, with backing vocals starting in the second verse, the lead guitar entering just before the bridge, and the bridge itself featuring added harmonium and extra vocals. Lennon's lead vocal is automatically double tracked with each of the two slightly-out-of-phase tracks split onto separate stereo channels; creating a surrealistic effect supporting the lyric about drug use. An interesting feature is the suitably \"blissful\" modulation (on \"Well, well, well, you're feeling fine\") to the key of B on the bridge via an F pivot chord (VI in the old key of A and V in the new key of B).\n\nThe extended jam that lasts 43 seconds at the end was recorded, but it was removed and replaced with a fade-out. In the US mono mix of the song, as released on \"Yesterday and Today\", Lennon appears to say \"OK, Herb\" at the very end of the track.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Doctor Robert\" during the early part of the \"Revolver\" sessions. The session for the song took place on 17 April 1966 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. It was a relatively straightforward track to record, compared to the more experimental songs such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Rain\". The band achieved a satisfactory basic track after seven takes, with a line-up comprising Lennon on rhythm guitar, McCartney on bass, Harrison on maracas, and Ringo Starr on drums. Harrison then overdubbed lead guitar, treated with automatic double tracking (ADT) and fed through a Leslie speaker to enhance the sound, and Lennon added harmonium over the two bridges. McCartney played a piano part, although it was not retained on the finished recording.\n\nVocals were added to the track at the group's next session, on 19 April. These consisted of Lennon's lead vocal and McCartney's high harmony part, and Harrison supplying a third voice over the bridges. Lennon's vocal was also treated with ADT. The song was mixed in mono for its US release on 12 May and in stereo on 20 May. It was subsequently remixed in mono on 21 June.\n\n\"Doctor Robert\" was one of the three songs from the \"Revolver\" sessions, all written by Lennon, that were given to Capitol Records in early May 1966 for inclusion on the US release \"Yesterday and Today\". In other countries, it appeared on \"Revolver\", where it was sequenced as the fourth track on side two of the LP, between \"For No One\" and \"I Want to Tell You\". The album was released on 5 August, shortly before the Beatles commenced their final concert tour, in Chicago. Author Shawn Levy describes \"Revolver\" as pop music's \"first true drug album\" rather than merely a \"record with some druggy insinuations\", and he attributes this especially to Lennon's contributions.\n\nIn November, artist Alan Aldridge created a cartoon illustration of \"Doctor Robert\" and three other \"Revolver\" tracks to accompany a feature article on the Beatles in \"Woman's Mirror\" magazine. The illustration depicted Lennon dressed in a black cape that was partly drawn aside to reveal a set of shiny surgical instruments, although Aldridge's original design – which was overruled by the magazine's management for fear of offending potential advertisers – instead showed human limbs hanging inside the cape. Impressed with the artist's work, Lennon bought the original picture and proudly displayed it at his home. According to Aldridge, Lennon told him that he had \"got it wrong, though\" in depicting Dr Robert as a physician concerned with the human anatomy; instead, he was a \"New York doctor who sold speed\".\n\nIn his review of \"Revolver\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls \"Doctor Robert\" Lennon's \"most straightforward number\" on the album, when compared to his other \"Revolver\" compositions \"And Your Bird Can Sing\", \"She Said She Said\", \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". Richie Unterberger, in his review of the song for AllMusic, complimented the song's guitar pattern, being a possible influence from bands such as the Who. Unterberger also praises the vocal performances, particularly McCartney's high harmonies during the verses. Writing in his book \"Revolution in the Head\", Ian MacDonald says that although the song is only a \"minor\" Beatles track, it is among the band's \"most incisive pieces\". He highlights the combination of Lennon's \"caustic vocal\", McCartney's \"huckstering harmony in fourths\" and Harrison's \"double-tracked guitar, with its unique blend of sitar and country-and-western\".\n\nReviewing the album for \"Mojo\" in 2002, Charles Shaar Murray grouped \"Doctor Robert\" with \"And Your Bird Can Sing\", \"She Said She Said\" and \"I Want to Tell You\" as guitar-based tracks that \"glisten\" with \"glorious cascades of jangle\". He identified this jangle quality as the Beatles' response to \"what The Byrds had done with the Fabs' own proto-folk-rock sound on \"A Hard Day's Night\"\".<ref name=\"CSM/Mojo\"></ref> When \"Mojo\" released \"Revolver Reloaded\" in 2006, part of the magazine's series of CDs of Beatles albums covered track-by-track by modern artists, \"Doctor Robert\" was covered by Luke Temple.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, except where noted:\n\n\n"}

It can grow up to tall. Its leaves have a clove-like aroma with a hint of peppery taste; they are used for culinary and medicinal purposes. It is thought to have been one of the major sources of the medicinal plant leaves known in classic and medieval times as malabathrum (or malobathrum).\n\nThe leaves, known as \"tējapattā\" or \"tejpatta\" (तेजपत्ता) in Hindi, \"tejpat\" (तेजपात/তেজপাত) in Nepali, Maithili and Assamese, \"tejpata\" (তেজপাতা) in Bengali, \"vazhanayila\" () in Malayalam, and \"tamalpatra\" (तमालपत्र) in Marathi and in original Sanskrit, are used extensively in the cuisines of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, particularly in the Moghul cuisine of North India and Nepal and in \"tsheringma\" herbal tea in Bhutan. It is called \"biryani aaku\" or \"bagharakku\" in Telugu.\n\nThe Lepcha of Sikkim call it .\n\nIt is often used in kumbilappam or chakka-ada (ചക്ക അട), an authentic sweet from Kerala, infusing its characteristic flavor to the dumplings. They are often labeled as \"Indian bay leaves,\" or just \"bay leaf\", causing confusion with the leaf from the bay laurel, a tree of Mediterranean origin in a different genus; the appearance and aroma of the two are quite different. Bay laurel leaves are shorter and light- to medium-green in color, with one large vein down the length of the leaf, while \"tejpat\" leaves are about twice as long and wider, usually olive green in color, with three veins down the length of the leaf. There are five types of \"tejpat\" leaves and they impart a strong cassia- or cinnamon-like aroma to dishes, while the bay laurel leaf's aroma is more reminiscent of pine and lemon.\n\n\nThe bark is sometimes used for cooking, although it is regarded as inferior to true cinnamon or cassia. Methanolic extract of \"C. tamala\" leaves fed at 10 mg/kg to alloxan-induced diabetic rats for 15 days resulted in significant reduction in blood glucose level, blood glycosylated haemoglobin, LPO, serum AST, and ALT, and significant increase in the antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GSH, and SOD. \"C. tamala\" could be used as an adjunct therapy in diabetes.\n\nMalabar had been traditionally used to denote the west coast of Southern India that forms the present-day state of Kerala and adjoining areas. The word \"mala\" or \"malaya\" means \"mountain\" in the Tamil and Malayalam languages, as also in Sanskrit. The word \"malabathrum\" is thought to have been derived from the Sanskrit \"tamālapattram\" (तमालपत्त्रम्), literally meaning \"dark-tree leaves\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2248504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248504", "title": "I Want to Tell You", "text": "I Want to Tell You\n\n\"I Want to Tell You\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1966 album \"Revolver\". It was written and sung by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. After \"Taxman\" and \"Love You To\", it was the third Harrison composition recorded for \"Revolver\". Its inclusion on the LP marked the first time that he was allocated more than two songs on a Beatles album, a reflection of his continued growth as a songwriter beside John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nWhen writing \"I Want to Tell You\", Harrison drew inspiration from his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed \"the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit\". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The recording marked the first time that McCartney played his bass guitar part after the band had completed the rhythm track for a song, a technique that became commonplace on the Beatles' subsequent recordings.\n\nAmong music critics and Beatles biographers, many writers have admired the group's performance on the track, particularly McCartney's use of Indian-style vocal melisma. Harrison performed \"I Want to Tell You\" as the opening song throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton. A version recorded during that tour appears on his \"Live in Japan\" album. At the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, the song was used to open the Western portion of the event, when it was performed by Jeff Lynne. Ted Nugent, the Smithereens, Thea Gilmore and Melvins are among the other artists who have covered the track.\n\nGeorge Harrison wrote \"I Want to Tell You\" in the early part of 1966, the year in which his songwriting matured in terms of subject matter and productivity. As a secondary composer to John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the Beatles, Harrison began to establish his own musical identity through his absorption in Indian culture, as well as the perspective he gained through his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). According to author Gary Tillery, the song resulted from a \"creative surge\" that Harrison experienced at the start of 1966. During the same period, the Beatles had been afforded an unusually long time free of professional commitments due to their decision to turn down \"A Talent for Loving\" as their third film for United Artists. Harrison used this time to study the Indian sitar and, like Lennon, to explore philosophical issues in his songwriting while preparing to record the band's next album, \"Revolver\".\n\nIn his autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison says that \"I Want to Tell You\" addresses \"the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit\". Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc cite the song, along with \"Rain\" and \"Within You Without You\", as an early example of the Beatles abandoning \"coy\" statements in their lyrics and instead \"adopt[ing] an urgent tone, intent on channeling some essential knowledge, the psychological and/or philosophical epiphanies of LSD experience\" to their listeners. Writing in \"The Beatles Anthology\", Harrison likened the outlook inspired by his taking the drug to that of \"an astronaut on the moon, or in his spaceship, looking back at the Earth. I was looking back to the Earth from my awareness.\"\n\nAuthor Robert Rodriguez views the song as reflecting the effects of Harrison's search for increased awareness, in that \"the faster and more wide-reaching his thoughts came, the greater the struggle to find the words to express them\". As reproduced in \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison's original lyrics were more direct and personal, compared with the philosophical focus of the completed song. The latter has nevertheless invited interpretation as a standard love song, in which the singer is cautiously entering into a romance. Another interpretation is that the theme of miscommunication was a statement on the Beatles' divergence from their audience, during a time when the group had tired of performing concerts before screaming fans.\n\n\"I Want to Tell You\" is in the key of A major and in a standard time signature of 4/4. It contains a low-register, descending guitar riff that music journalist Richie Unterberger describes as \"circular, full\" and \"typical of 1966 British mod rock\". The riff opens and closes the song and recurs between the verses. Particularly over the introduction, the rests between the riff's syncopated notes create a stammering effect. The metric anomalies suggested by this effect are borne out further in the uneven, eleven-bar length of the verse. The main portion of the song consists of two verses, a bridge (or middle eight), followed by a verse, a second bridge and the final verse.\nAccording to Rodriguez, \"I Want to Tell You\" is an early example of Harrison \"matching the music to the message\", as aspects of the song's rhythm, harmony and structure combine to convey the difficulties in achieving meaningful communication. As in his 1965 composition \"Think for Yourself\", Harrison's choice of chords reflects his interest in harmonic expressivity. The verse opens with a harmonious E-A-B-C#-E melody-note progression over an A major chord, after which the melody begins a harsh ascent with a move to the II7 (B7) chord. Further to the off-kilter quality of the opening riff, musicologist Alan Pollack identifies this chord change as part of the disorientating characteristics of the verses, due to the change occurring midway through the fourth bar, rather than at the start of the measure. The musical and emotional dissonance is then heightened by the use of E79, a chord that Harrison said he happened upon while striving for a sound that adequately conveyed a sense of frustration. With the return to the I chord for the guitar riff, the harmonic progression through the verse suggests what author Ian MacDonald terms \"an Oriental variant of the A major scale\" that is \"more Arabic than Indian\".\n\nThe middle eight sections present a softer harmonic content relative to the strident progression over the verses. The melody encompasses B minor, diminished and major 7 chords, together with A major. The inner voicings within this chord pattern produce a chromatic descent of notes through each semitone from F to C. Musicologist Walter Everett comments on the aptness of the conciliatory lyric \"Maybe you'd understand\", which closes the second of these sections, as the melody concludes on a perfect authentic cadence, representing in musical terms \"a natural emblem for any coming together\".\n\nPollack views the song's outro as partly a reprise of the introduction and partly a departure in the form of \"a one-two-three-\"go!\" style of fade-out ending\". On the Beatles' recording, the group vocals over this section include Indian-style gamaks (performed by McCartney) on the word \"time\", creating a melisma effect that is also present on Harrison's \"Revolver\" track \"Love You To\" and on Lennon's \"Rain\". Further to Harrison's drawn-out phrasing over the first line of the verses, this detail demonstrates the composition's subtle Indian influence.\n\nThe lyrics to \"I Want to Tell You\" address problems in communication and the inadequacy of words in conveying genuine emotion. Writing in 1969, author Dave Laing identified \"serene desperation\" in the song's \"attempt at real total contact in any interpersonal context\". Author Ian Inglis notes that lines such as \"My head is filled with things to say\" and \"The games begin to drag me down\" present in modern-day terms the same concepts regarding interpersonal barriers with which philosophers have struggled since the pre-Socratic period.\n\nMacDonald cites the lyrics to the first bridge – \"But if I seem to act unkind / It's only me, it's not my mind / That is confusing things\" – as an example of Harrison applying an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as \"contradictions between different levels of being\". In Laing's interpretation, the entities \"me\" and \"my mind\" represent, respectively, \"individualistic, selfish ego\" and \"the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time\". In \"I, Me, Mine\", however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of \"me\" and \"my mind\" should be reversed, since: \"The mind is the thing that hops about telling us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind.\"\n\nFurther to Laing's reading of the song's message, author and critic Tim Riley deems the barriers in communication to be the boundaries imposed by the anxious, Western concept of time, as Harrison instead \"seeks healthy exchange and the enlightened possibilities\" offered outside such limitations. According to Riley, \"the transcendental key\" is therefore the song's concluding lines – \"I don't mind / I could wait forever, I've got time\" – signifying the singer's release from vexation and temporal restrictions.\n\nUntitled at the time, \"I Want to Tell You\" was the third Harrison composition that the Beatles recorded for \"Revolver\", although his initial submission for a third contribution was \"Isn't It a Pity\". It was the first time he had been permitted more than two songs on one of the group's albums. The opportunity came about due to Lennon's inability to write any new material over the previous weeks.<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> Exasperated by Harrison's habit of not titling his compositions, Lennon jokingly named it \"Granny Smith Part Friggin' Two\" – referring to the working title, derived from the Granny Smith apple, for \"Love You To\". Following Lennon's remark, Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' recording engineer, named the new song \"Laxton's Superb\" after another variety of apple.\nThe Beatles taped the main track, consisting of guitars, piano and drums, at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. The session took place on 2 June 1966, the day after Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar for the first time and secured Shankar's agreement to help him master the sitar. The band recorded five takes of the song before Harrison selected the third of these for further work. After reduction to a single track on the four-track master tape, their performance consisted of Harrison on lead guitar, treated with a Leslie effect, McCartney on piano and Ringo Starr on drums, with Lennon adding tambourine. The group then overdubbed vocals, with McCartney and Lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside Harrison's lead vocal. Further overdubs included maracas, the sound of which Pollack likens to a rattlesnake; additional piano, at the end of the bridge sections and over the E79 chord in the verses; and handclaps.\nCreated during a period when the Beatles had fully embraced the recording studio as a means of artistic expression, the recording added further to the message behind the song. Like \"Eight Days a Week\", the completed track begins with a fade-in,<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref> a device that in combination with the fadeout, according to Rodriguez, \"provided a circular effect, perfectly matching the song's lack of resolution\". Everett similarly recognises McCartney's \"clumsy finger-tapping impatience\" on the piano over the E79 chord as an apt expression of the struggle to articulate.\n\nThe final overdub was McCartney's bass guitar part, which he added on 3 June. The process of recording the bass separately from a rhythm track provided greater flexibility when mixing a song, and allowed McCartney to control the harmonic structure of the music by defining chords. As confirmed by the band's recording historian, Mark Lewisohn, \"I Want to Tell You\" was the first Beatles song to have the bass superimposed onto a dedicated track on the recording. This technique became commonplace in the Beatles' subsequent work. During the 3 June session, the song was temporarily renamed \"I Don't Know\", which had been Harrison's reply to a question from producer George Martin as to what he wanted to call the track. The eventual title was decided on by 6 June, during a remixing and tape-copying session for the album.\nEMI's Parlophone label released \"Revolver\" on 5 August 1966, one week before the Beatles began their final North American tour. \"I Want to Tell You\" was sequenced on side two of the LP between Lennon's song about a New York doctor who administered amphetamine doses to his wealthy patients, \"Doctor Robert\", and \"Got to Get You into My Life\", which McCartney said he wrote as \"an ode to pot\". For the North American version of \"Revolver\", however, Capitol Records omitted \"Doctor Robert\", together with two other Lennon-written tracks; as a result, the eleven-song US release reinforced the level of contribution from McCartney and from Harrison.\n\nAccording to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Harrison's \"Revolver\" compositions – \"Taxman\", which opened the album, the Indian music-styled \"Love You To\", and \"I Want to Tell You\" – established him as a songwriter within the band. Recalling the release in the 2004 edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\", Rob Sheffield said that \"Revolver\" displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from the Beatles' \"prettiest music\" to \"their scariest\", among which \"I Want to Tell You\" represented the band at \"their friendliest\". Commenting on the unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a Beatles album, Harrison told \"Melody Maker\" in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator, as Lennon and McCartney were to one another. He added: \"when you're competing against John and Paul, you have to be very good to even get in the same league.\"\n\nIn a contemporary review for the \"NME\", Allen Evans wrote that \"The Beatles' individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear\" and he admired the song's combination of guitar and piano motifs and vocal harmonies. In their combined album review in \"Record Mirror\", Richard Green found the track \"Well-written, produced and sung\" and praised the harmony singing, while Peter Jones commented on the effectiveness of the introduction and concluded: \"The deliberately off-key sounds in the backing are again very distinctive. Adds something to a toughly romantic number.\"\n\nIn America, due to the controversy there surrounding Lennon's remark that the Beatles had become more popular than Christianity, the initial reviews of \"Revolver\" were relatively lukewarm. While commenting on this phenomenon in September 1966, \"KRLA Beat\"s reviewer described \"I Want to Tell You\" as \"unusual, newly-melodic, and interesting\" and lamented that, as with songs such as \"She Said She Said\" and \"Yellow Submarine\", it was being denied the recognition it deserved.\n\nWriting in \"Rolling Stone\"s Harrison commemorative issue, in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore recognised his incorporation of dissonance on \"I Want to Tell You\" as having been \"revolutionary in popular music\" in 1966. Gilmore considered this innovation to be \"perhaps more originally creative\" than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and incorporated into the Beatles' work over the same period. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the E79 chord that Harrison introduced in the song became \"one of the most legendary in the entire Beatles catalogue\". Speaking in 2001, Harrison said: \"I'm really proud of that as I literally invented that chord … John later borrowed it on I Want You (She's So Heavy): [over the line] 'It's driving me mad.'\"<ref name=\"Garbarini/GW\"></ref>\n\nIn his overview of \"I Want to Tell You\", Alan Pollack highlights Harrison's descending guitar riff as \"one of those all-time great ostinato patterns that sets the tone of the whole song right from the start\". Producer and musician Chip Douglas has stated that he based the guitar riff for the Monkees' 1967 hit \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\" on that of the Beatles' song. Neil Innes of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band (and later the Rutles) recalls being at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles were recording \"I Want to Tell You\" and his band were working on a 1920s vaudeville song titled \"My Brother Makes the Noises for the Talkies\". Innes said he heard the Beatles playing back \"I Want to Tell You\" at full volume and appreciated then, in the words of music journalist Robert Fontenot, \"just how far out of their league he was, creatively\". Innes has since included his recollection of this episode in his stage show.\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald cites the song as an example of Harrison's standing as \"[if] not the most talented then certainly the most thoughtful of the songwriting Beatles\". He comments that, in keeping with the lyrics' subtle Hindu-aligned perspective, Harrison's embrace of Indian philosophy \"was dominating the social life of the group\" a year after its release. Jonathan Gould considers that the track would have been a highlight of any Beatles album before \"Revolver\" but, such was the standard of songwriting on their 1966 album, it \"gets lost in the shuffle of Lennon and McCartney tunes on side two\". Simon Leng writes that, aided by the \"fertile harmonic imagination\" evident in \"I Want to Tell You\", \"Revolver\" \"changed George Harrison's musical identity for good\", presenting him in a multitude of roles: \"a guitarist, a singer, a world music innovator … [and] a songwriter\".\n\nIn his review of the song for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger admires its \"interesting, idiosyncratic qualities\" and the group vocals on the recording, adding that McCartney's singing merits him recognition as \"one of the great upper-register male harmony singers in rock\". Similarly impressed with McCartney's contribution, Joe Bosso of MusicRadar describes the incorporation of vocal melisma as \"an affectionate nod to Harrison's Indian influences\" and includes the track among his choice of Harrison's ten best songs from the Beatles era. In a 2009 review of \"Revolver\", Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound said that Harrison's presence as a third vocalist \"fits perfectly in contrast with some of the bigger aspects of the [album's] psychedelic sounds\", and added: \"In a song like 'I Want To Tell You', the sinister piano and the steady, near-tribal drum line combine effortlessly with his voice to make for a song that is as beautiful as it is emotionally impacting and disturbing.\"\n\nTed Nugent covered \"I Want to Tell You\" on his 1979 album \"State of Shock\",<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> a version that \"Billboard\"s reviewer said was \"probably enough to sell the album\". Nugent's recording was also released as a single that year, and later appeared on his 1998 compilation \"Super Hits\". The Lambrettas and Mike Melvoin are among the other artists who have recorded the song. The Grateful Dead included \"I Want to Tell You\" in their live performances in 1994, before which Jerry Garcia had occasionally performed it live with his long-running solo project, the Jerry Garcia Band.\nAlthough \"I Want to Tell You\" had been the least well-known of Harrison's three tracks on \"Revolver\", it gained greater renown after he began performing it live in the early 1990s. A live version from his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton opens Harrison's \"Live In Japan\" album, released in 1992. Harrison said that, even before rehearsals, he had chosen \"I Want to Tell You\" as the opening song for the tour, which marked his first series of concerts since 1974, and his first visit to Japan since the Beatles had played there during their 1966 world tour. On this live version, he and Clapton extend the song by each playing a guitar solo. \"I Want to Tell You\" was also Harrison's opener at the Natural Law Party Concert, held at London's Royal Albert Hall in April 1992, which was his only full-length concert as a solo artist in Britain. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne performed \"I Want to Tell You\" at the Concert for George tribute, where it served as the first song of the main, Western-music portion of the event. Lynne was backed by a large band, including Clapton and other musicians who had supported Harrison on the 1991 tour and at the Natural Law Party Concert.\n\nBlue Cartoon covered the song in the power pop style for the Harrison tribute album \"He Was Fab\", released in 2002. The following year, the Smithereens contributed a recording to another Harrison tribute album, \"\". The band also included the track on the 2005 deluxe edition of \"God Save the Smithereens\". Thea Gilmore recorded the song during the sessions for her 2006 album \"Harpo's Ghost\", a version that appeared on \"Mojo\" magazine's \"Revolver Reloaded\" CD celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Beatles' album. The Melvins covered \"I Want to Tell You\" on their 2016 album \"Basses Loaded\", with Steven Shane McDonald on bass. While Pitchfork Media's reviewer dismisses the Melvins' performance as a throwaway version of a \"Beatles classic\", Jared Skinner of PopMatters describes it as \"solid proof of their ability to make loud, gleeful rock 'n' roll\".\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

Launched in support of the group's 1997 album \"Pop\", the tour's concerts were performed in stadiums and parks in 1997 and 1998. Much like the band's previous Zoo TV Tour, PopMart was elaborately staged. Its lavish stage design had a LED screen, a golden arch, and a large mirror-ball lemon. As with the Zoo TV tour, the band delivered an image and performance that were ironic and self-mocking, deviating from its earnest performances of the 1980s; the band performed in costumes that, along with the PopMart stage design, poked fun at the themes of consumerism and pop culture.\n\nThe PopMart Tour's five legs and 93 shows attracted about 3.9 million fans. The tour took U2 to South America, South Africa and Israel for the first time. The tour was booked while the band were still completing \"Pop\", which was planned for release in the 1996 holiday season. However, the recording sessions went long, delaying the release until March 1997 and cutting into rehearsal time for the tour. PopMart, although the second-highest-grossing tour of 1997, was marred by technical difficulties and mixed reviews from critics and fans particularly in the United States. The tour was depicted on the concert film \"\".\n\nU2 stage designer Willie Williams and stage architect Mark Fisher began developing the PopMart Tour in late 1995. U2 re-entered their Dublin recording studio in October 1995, shortly before releasing an experimental/ambient album with Brian Eno, entitled \"Original Soundtracks 1\", under the pseudonym \"Passengers\". The band started to work on their ninth studio album, which was set to be finished by mid-1996 and released later that year prior to the Christmas and holiday season. Around the same time, in late 1995, Williams began developing concepts for the band's next tour. Among the proposed themes for the tour was a concept based on the end of the millennium titled \"U2000\", and a discothèque concept involving a large mobile disco. Lead vocalist Bono became interested in one of Williams' designs that resembled a supermarket, which was inspired by facades of American post-war suburban outlet stores. Bono who believed that the symbol of a supermarket, with its large number of choices and temptations, could be used as a metaphor for U2's songs, which often deal with the struggle between desire and faith. With the help of Fisher, Williams designed a fantasy \"entertainment outlet\", and decided to create a tour with a consumerism theme.\n\nWhile still in the recording studio, U2 began scheduling tour dates in early 1996, along with band manager Paul McGuinness. U2's stadium performances from the Zoo TV Tour received much positive reception, therefore McGuinness decided that the entire tour should take place in large stadiums, as opposed to beginning the tour in smaller arenas, despite the fact that the band did not feel another stadium tour was necessary. After risking bankruptcy by self-financing the Zoo TV Tour, U2 decided to seek outside sources to finance the cost of taking the PopMart Tour around the world. Initially, the band announced they were looking for sponsors to support the tour, but they later decided to instead use a single promoter for financial assistance. Bids were made with five separate parties, and eventually a deal was made with Toronto-based concert promoter Michael Cohl for $100 million. Cohl expected a total five to six million attendees at over 100 concerts, beginning in April 1997. He also expected the tour to gross $260 million, almost $20 million more than the Rolling Stones' Voodoo Lounge Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour in history at the time, and also organized by Cohl.\n\nAs the recording sessions on the new album progressed, U2 decided they would not be ready to finish their album for the mid-year production deadline, and pushed back the release date by several months. To get the album ready for its March 1997 release, the album's recording sessions had to be finished by the end of December. Within one month of the production deadline, the album was still untitled and had much work left before it could be completed. Because the dates for the tour had already been booked, the album's release could not be delayed any further. Eventually, the album was titled \"Pop\", and Williams dubbed the title \"PopMart\" for the tour. The album's recording sessions were finished in time for the March 1997 release date, but the band felt they still needed another month to fully complete the album. Bono later stated that letting McGuinness book the tour before the album was finished was the worst decision that U2 ever made because it forced them to finish up the album sooner than they had wanted.\n\nAfter producing the band's previous tour, Zoo TV, which featured a complex setup involving 36 different video screens, Williams did not want to produce another video-based show unless it was going to be completely different from its predecessor. His initial proposals to U2 featured physical designs, including a center stage surrounded by a racetrack with circling trucks and motorbikes. Fisher researched one of the first LED screens to be imported into the United States. (It was built for the State Fair of Texas in 1995). Fisher proposed to make a much larger LED screen by spacing the pixels further apart, thus creating a lower resolution image. A prototype was built with LED pixels placed 75 mm (3 in) apart on a cargo net. It worked successfully and served as a basis for the proposal of the design. The idea for producing another video-based tour gained much interest when Fisher and Williams were determined to create the largest video screen in existence at that time. When the idea for the screen was proposed to U2, they decided to take the risk of creating a show based on an undeveloped technological experiment, and invested US$7 million to develop the screen.\n\nFisher proposed the idea of creating an LED screen on a flexible fabric sheet that could be draped over the stadium seats behind the stage. It was later decided that it would be easier to build the screen if it was hung in its own frame, so a sloped frame was added to the screen. Several months were spent experimenting with and demonstrating the capabilities of LED video. The screen designed for the show was ten times larger than all 36 Zoo TV screens put together, with a total size that ranged between 150–170 feet (46–52 metres) wide and 50–56 feet (15–17 metres) tall, approximately the same size as the backdrop used during the band's Lovetown Tour in 1989. The screen was created with the help of three separate companies, each of whom manufactured different components. The screen contained 150,000 pixels, each of which contained eight separate LEDs of various colors. The pixels were manufactured by SACO Technologies, a Montreal-based company, which specialized in manufacturing control systems and panels for nuclear and hydrogen power stations. U2 was SACO's first client, and prior to the PopMart Tour, the company had no experience with video technology. Each of the pixels were mounted onto 4,500 separate aluminium tubes, which were then broken down into 187 foldable panels, spread across 22 columns, which would easily fit into two trucks.\n\nThe set's public address (PA) system was initially designed by Fisher who proposed a monophonic system with speakers mounted on top of two large antler-like structures in front of the video screen. While discussing the structure to support the centralized PA system, Williams recalled a statement Bono made on the Zoo TV Tour about having a \"secret fantasy to play a show underneath a set of gigantic golden arches\". So the design was changed to feature a 100-foot (30-m) parabolic arch supporting the PA in the center of the stage. To further develop the concept, Fisher drew a version of the concert stage transformed into a supermarket, which later appeared in the \"Pop\" album artwork.\n\nWhile the set's overall design consisted of simply an arch in front of a sloped video screen, Williams wanted to incorporate a mirrorball into the set, which had previously been featured on both The Joshua Tree and Zoo TV Tours. Bono proposed that the mirrorball should be used as a vehicle in which the band would travel over the audience and onto the B-stage during the show, while making reference to the Parliament-Funkadelic spaceship. Williams took Bono's idea seriously, and suggested that the mirrorball should be lemon-shaped, a reference to U2's song \"Lemon\" from their album \"Zooropa\". Fisher designed a 40-foot (12 m) motorized lemon mirrorball, which was placed on the right side of the stage. The final additions to the set included a 12-foot-wide (3.8-m) olive mounted onto a 100-foot (30-m) cocktail stick.\n\nGoing along with the tour's satirical theme of consumerism, U2 announced their tour on 12 February 1997 by holding a news conference at a Kmart discount store in New York City. Hundreds of reporters from record companies, radio stations, television networks, newspapers, and magazines were in attendance at the conference, whose location was not revealed until the night before. Upon their arrival at the store, U2 got up on the stage assembled in the store's lingerie department, and performed \"Holy Joe\", a B-side from the \"Discothèque\" single, which had been released nine days prior. The entire event was broadcast live through various sources on television, radio, and the Internet. Following the performance, the band answered questions for a half hour. On why retail was the primary theme of the tour, Bono said, “I can’t quite recall how it got to the idea of taking a supermarket on the road...I remember it making a lot of sense at the time. As I’m sitting here, I’m trying to think what that [reason] is.\" It was announced that the beginning of the PopMart Tour was to feature stadium shows in 62 cities throughout North America and Europe, beginning in Whitney, Nevada, on 25 April, and ending in Seattle, Washington, on 12 December. They would tour an additional 12 cities in 1998 throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. Tickets went on sale for the announced dates several days after the tour's announcement, and were priced at an average of $50 worldwide. Due to the lack of sponsors for the tour, ticket prices were almost 50% higher for this tour than Zoo TV. In markets where the average income was low, tickets were sold for a lower price, which was enough for the band to break even, but not lose any money in the process.\n\nBefore the tour, various markets distributed singles to promote ticket sales. A double 12-inch single of U2 remixes was distributed in Canada, and a CD single of various songs taken from U2's studio albums was released by a radio station in Mexico. In Europe, U2's remix of \"Pop Muzik\" used to open the PopMart shows, was released as a single on both 12-inch and CD formats. While the first single from \"Pop\", \"Discothèque\", was released in January 1997, \"Staring at the Sun\" became the second single from the album, and was released in April 1997 to coincide with the beginning of the tour.\n\nOn 26 April 1997, American television network ABC aired a one-hour prime time special about \"Pop\" and the PopMart Tour, titled \"U2: A Year in Pop\". Narrated by actor Dennis Hopper, the documentary featured footage from the \"Pop\" recording sessions, as well as live footage from the opening PopMart show in Whitney, which took place the night before. The program received poor reception, ranking at 101 out of 107 programs aired that week, according to Nielsen ratings, and became the lowest rated non-political documentary in the history of the ABC network. Despite the low ratings, McGuinness appreciated the opportunity for the band to appear on network television in the first place, stating that the small audience for the television special was still a large audience for the band, as it was much larger than any audience that could be obtained by MTV.\n\nDuring the middle of the tour's first leg, MSN launched U2's first official website, U2popmart.MSN.com. The website was updated constantly throughout the tour, featuring images and audio clips from various concerts, as well as live webcasts during select performances.\n\nOut of the 93 concerts performed during the PopMart Tour, each show had a similar setlist, with 21–24 songs performed by the band at each show. The concerts began with U2's remix of M's \"Pop Muzik\" played through the PA system. During the song, the band members would walk through the crowd with bodyguards, similar to the beginning of a boxing match. The band would then walk onto the end of the B-stage, heading towards the main stage, where they would begin the show.\n\nEach concert opened with a performance of \"Mofo.\" Following \"Mofo\" at every show, the band performed \"I Will Follow\", \"Even Better Than the Real Thing\", \"Gone\", \"Last Night on Earth\", and \"Until the End of the World\". As the group performed, the audience was bombarded with images and colors, all designed towards the show's ironic embrace of tackiness and \"pop\"-ular culture.\n\nEach show featured \"Staring at the Sun\" during the middle of the set, and many shows featured \"New Year's Day\" and \"All I Want Is You\". \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\", and \"Bullet the Blue Sky\" (often preceded by \"Miami\") were also played at every show. Those songs were often followed by an \"Edge Karaoke\" slot, in which The Edge would sing The Monkees' \"Daydream Believer\" or a similar song against a cheap karaoke CD, complete with lyrics shown on the giant screen. The end of each main set featured \"Please\", which segued into \"Where the Streets Have No Name\".\n\nAt the end of the main set, before the first encore, the giant lemon moved to the middle of the stage. There a sheet fell off exposing a huge disco ball that lit up the stadium in spinning lights while the Perfecto Mix of \"Lemon\" played over the PA. The band then would walk out of the giant lemon onto the B stage to perform \"Discothèque\".\n\nThe rest of the first encore typically consisted of \"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\" and \"With or Without You\". After another brief break, the band would return to perform \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\", their single from 1995 for the \"Batman Forever\" soundtrack, followed by \"Mysterious Ways\". \"One\" always followed, ending a handful of shows, but otherwise it was followed by one more song. \"Unchained Melody\", \"Wake Up Dead Man\", and \"MLK\" were variously performed to close the show. On a handful of occasions, the show ended with another song, such as \"Rain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" (during which the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo were brought on stage in Buenos Aires), \"40\", or \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". \"She's a Mystery to Me\" and \"Staring at the Sun\" each ended a single show, as well.\nA total of 55 different songs were played throughout the tour and 17 of the 55 songs were played at all PopMart shows. Out of the 12 songs on \"Pop\", each song was played in full at least once, with the exception of \"The Playboy Mansion\", which was only featured as a snippet several times at the end of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". \"Do You Feel Loved\" was only performed during the first six shows, and \"If God Will Send His Angels\" was performed once by the full band, plus about 20 other times solely by Bono and The Edge. \"Bad\" and \"Desire\" were also played at a handful of shows.\n\nThis set list is representative of the tour's average setlist as conducted by Setlist.fm, which represents all concerts for the duration of the tour.\n\nEncore\n\n2nd Encore\nDuring the Zoo TV Tour, U2 aired controversial satellite link-ups to Sarajevo. The link-ups were arranged by aid worker Bill Carter, who interviewed ordinary people about their experiences of the ongoing War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of the satellite broadcasts, U2 promised to play in Sarajevo. The Sarajevo show had to wait until the PopMart Tour, when U2 became the first major band to perform in the city after the war had ended. The highly emotional concert was among the highlights of the PopMart Tour. 45,000 people attended and effort was made to make sure all the ethnic groups were present. Also in attendance were several hundred members of the international \"Stabilisation Force\" (SFOR) who were tasked at that time with upholding the Dayton Agreement. During the encore, Brian Eno got on stage for the band's first ever live performance of \"Miss Sarajevo.\" Luciano Pavarotti, who was guest vocalist on the original recording was not in Sarajevo. However, his vocal was retained. An old style phonograph, complete with amplifying horn, was brought on stage for the song and its stylus was moved into position by Brian Eno to coincide with the tenor's vocal contribution. Unfortunately, the performance of this song did not go as well as planned as the band's timing was off and Bono was having difficulty with his voice. It was in this context that Bono chose to apologize to the audience for the band not being able to \"fucking play it.\" After the Sarajevo show in 1997, \"Miss Sarajevo\" was not played again until the second leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2005.\n\nThis concert was also the first time the band had performed \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" in more than four years. It was performed solo by The Edge who frequently introduced the song during the final legs of the tour by stating that the band had \"rediscovered\" it in Sarajevo. Larry Mullen also played the leading drumbeat from the song as part of the second half of \"Please\".\n\nDespite the subpar performance, a news story said, \"For two magical hours, the rock band U2 achieved what warriors, politicians and diplomats could not: They united Bosnia.\" Trains ran for the first time since the war to enable people to see the concert, though they were stopped again afterward. Bono later called the Sarajevo show \"one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life.\" \nLarry Mullen, Jr. called it \"an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.\"\n\nAlthough the extravagance of the tour was visually and technically impressive, the early dates of PopMart were, on occasion, marred by subpar performances. The band had booked the tour before the album was finished, and with the planned November 1996 release pushed back until March 1997 to finish the album, valuable tour rehearsal time was lost. This lack of preparation manifested itself in the shows, particularly during the poorly received opening night in Las Vegas. There was intense pressure for the band, especially with several journalists and celebrities in attendance. The band lost their timing on the song \"Staring at the Sun\", stopped playing partway through, and then started over. During \"Discotheque\", the crew filled the stage with too much dry-ice; the Edge could not see his guitar pedal in the midst of the smoke and had to kneel down to find it by touch.\n\nNonetheless, the quality of the performances improved greatly as certain new songs were dropped or reworked, old crowd favourites re-introduced and the setlist evolved into a more coherent order during the first two months. At the Giants Stadium dates, \"Staring at the Sun\" was performed acoustically by Bono and the Edge. Becoming one of the show's highlights, it would be performed this way for the rest of the tour.\n\nBy the second leg in Europe, the performances had vastly improved as evidenced by the \"Popheart\" EP that featured three songs from the first European show in Rotterdam.\n\nThe band had some difficulty filling stadiums in the southern and Midwestern US, yet there were multiple night sellouts in Chicago, New York and Boston. It was however better received by Europeans and in particular, South American audiences. It was the first time U2 had toured South America and Bono remarked that the rapturous fan response they received there helped U2 regain their confidence and appreciation for playing together.\n\nDespite its cleverness and positive critical response, many fans felt alienated by the shows; certain material from the \"Pop\" album didn't go down as well as U2 might have hoped and many people just didn't seem to get the joke. U2 had dressed as the Village People in the \"Discothèque\" video, and this willingness to mock their serious image continued during PopMart. (At the Los Angeles Coliseum show on 21 June, tribute was paid to the original \"Prefab Four\" with a guest appearance by Davy Jones of The Monkees to perform his signature song, \"Daydream Believer\".) But U2's irony-drenched \"big shtick\" failed to satisfy many critics and fans seemingly confused by the band's new image and elaborate sets.\nOne \"NME\" critic later recalled a \"ludicrous hullabaloo\" that was a departure from \"Planet Reality.\"\n\nDisrupting a few shows, technical problems also arose throughout the tour. As the band was about to walk out of the giant mechanical lemon for the encore of a show in Oslo, the lemon malfunctioned, trapping the band inside and forcing them to escape through a small hatch at the back. This incident was later listed as one of \"Rock 'n' Roll's 15 Most Embarrassing Stage Antics\" by AOL's Spinner.com.\nThe lemon malfunctioned again at a show in Sydney, and was not used at all, \nand also malfunctioned in Osaka, Japan, where the band was again trapped inside, but was unable to escape through the back. In addition to the issues with the mechanical lemon, the large LED video screen became damaged in Washington, D.C. by a rain storm during a concert. The video screen required time for repairs which ended up causing an entire concert in Raleigh, North Carolina to be cancelled.\n\nLike the band's previous Zoo TV Tour, PopMart was another huge success in terms of revenue, grossing US$171,677,024. On 20 September 1997, the band performed in front of over 150,000 people in Reggio Emilia, Italy, and set a new world record for having the most attendees at a concert for a single performer.\n\nMore than a decade after PopMart, despite the criticism and mishaps, Bono said that he considered the tour to be their best. \"Pop(Mart) is our finest hour. It's better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought.\" He later added \"When that show worked, it was mindblowing.\" The Edge said that he was \"very proud of [\"Pop\"] by the end of the tour. We finally figured it out by the time we made . It was an amazing show that I'm really proud of.\"\n\nIn April 1998, one month after the PopMart Tour had ended, U2 appeared as guest stars on the 200th episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Trash of the Titans.\" The episode featured U2 performing a PopMart concert in Springfield Stadium where Homer Simpson disrupted the show during a performance of \"Pride (In the Name of Love).\" The four members of the band and entire PopMart stage were shown in animated form. Bono, The Edge, and Adam Clayton had voice appearances in the episodes, as well as the band's manager, Paul McGuinness, and McGuinness' assistant, Susie Smith. Larry Mullen, Jr. was not present for the studio recordings, therefore he appeared in a non-speaking role. The band even had a small part in a musical number. U2's guest appearance was later featured on \"The Phoenix\"'s list of \"\"The Simpsons\" 20 Best Guest Voices of All Time.\"\n\nIn December 1997, the two PopMart Tour concerts in Mexico City were filmed for various future video and audio releases. In November 1998, PolyGram and Island Records released the video \"\" on VHS and Video CD. The video combined footage from the two concerts, and featured all 25 songs performed at both shows. \nThe VHS and Video CD releases have since been out of print; however, a DVD version was released for the first time in September 2007.\nIn 2000, the album \"Hasta la Vista Baby!\" was released exclusively to members of U2's fan club, which featured 14 of the 25 songs from Mexico City on one CD.\nReleased around the same time were the various \"Beautiful Day\" singles, which featured the live versions of \"Discothèque\", \"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\", and \"Last Night on Earth,\" the latter of which was also featured on the \"Elevation\" single.\nThe live video of \"Last Night on Earth\" appeared on the Australian \"Beautiful Day\" single, and the live video of \"Gone\" appeared on \"The Best of 1990–2000\" video releases.\n\nIn addition to the recordings from Mexico City, live versions of \"Please\", \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", and \"Staring at the Sun\" from Rotterdam, as well as \"With or Without You\" from Edmonton, were released internationally on the \"\", and later on the \"Please\" single in the United States.\nA live video of \"Please\" filmed in Helsinki, known as the \"Live Mural Cut\", was featured on the bonus DVD of the special edition release of the album, \"The Best of 1990–2000\".\n\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Breeding is confined to stagnant water, usually in peat bogs. Although not resident in the United Kingdom it occasionally migrates there in some numbers. Such 'Invasion Years' occurred in 1906, 1926, 1945, 1953, and 1995. On each occasion a small breeding colony appeared, but they have invariably died out after a few years.\n\nAn almost unmistakable darter, red-bodied in the male, with both sexes having large amounts of saffron-yellow colouration to the basal area of each wing, which is particularly noticeable on the hind-wings. Other \"Sympetrum\" species may have limited yellow-orange colouration near the extreme wing-bases, especially in females, but never so extensively as in this species.\n\nSites which are likely to attract this species have thick rushy margins. The yellow-winged darter tends to make quite short flights when settled at a site, and frequently perches quite low down on vegetation.\n\nThe yellow-winged darter has bred but is not established in the UK. It has occurred in Cumbria as single individuals on very few occasions. The most recent record was at Killington Reservoir in August 1995.\n\nIn Southern Europe, the nymphs of this dragonfly live in oligotrophic lakes with submerged vegetation, at high altitudes. Temperature and vegetation of these habitats are likely to be altered by Climate Change. As an abundant predator the species has an important role in food webs of high altitude lakes. Its disappearance will lead to changes in food webs.\n"}
{"id": "2248543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248543", "title": "Canvas X", "text": "Canvas X\n\nCanvas X is a drawing, imaging, and publishing computer program from Canvas GFX for personal computers.\n\nCanvas GFX's origins date back to 1987. The original idea for Canvas came from Jorge Miranda, one of the founders of Deneba Systems Inc. of Miami Florida, for Apple's Macintosh computers—part of the wave of programs that made the desktop publishing revolution.\n\nThe first version was unique in many ways; not least because it was released as both an application and a desk accessory. In the latter form, it could be used while another program, e.g. PageMaker, was running simultaneously; very handy in that time of single-program operation.\n\nCanvas provides tools for creating and editing vector and raster graphics. It is used for illustration, page layout, animation, presentations, and publications in printed and World Wide Web formats.\n\nFrom its inception, Canvas differed from other graphics applications because it combined tools and file formats for both vector graphics (line art) and raster images (photographic and other pixel-based), along with word-processing and page-layout features such as multiple-page documents and master pages. The user works in a window, which is the familiar \"page on a pasteboard\" analog used by many DTP and vector graphics programs, but in that window, which might be a single illustration page or one page of a multi-page magazine, book, web site, animation or presentation, the user can create or edit and layout text, vector graphics and raster images. Canvas also emphasized technical drawing in addition to artistic illustration features.\n\nWith Version 3.5, Deneba went cross-platform, releasing a version with file-format compatibility for Macintosh and Windows computers. \nAt Version 5, Canvas was completely rewritten for both platforms and included a QuickDraw palette for creating 3D primitives and renderings. \nVersion 7 of the software saw an internal extrusion engine being used instead of QuickDraw.\n\nAt version 8, it was the first of the complex graphics programs to be \"Carbonized\" to run on both Classic and Mac OS X. \n\nIn April 2003, Deneba Systems was acquired by ACD Systems of Victoria, BC, Canada, the developers of Windows image editing and handling software such as ACDSee, before the release of version 9. Canvas development continued in Miami, under the aegis of ACD Systems of America.\n\nWith the introduction of Canvas 11, support for the Macintosh platform was dropped, making the application Windows-only.\n\nCanvas is available in a standard and extended version. The once-optional Scientific Imaging module is now integrated into Canvas and provides enhanced input-output filters for file formats commonly used in science and engineering visualization. The geographic information system (GIS) module provides tools for use in mapping and GIS-based data analysis.\n\nFollowing the release of the Windows-only Canvas X 16, Canvas Draw for Mac was released, reviving Macintosh support (though on a separate roadmap from the Windows version) after a decade-long hiatus.\n\nWhile Canvas started out as a prosumer program in the general graphics/DTP market and continues to be the first (even only) tool of many professionals in such fields as graphics design, advertising, marketing, and DTP, it is less known in the consumer/prosumer market today than programs marketed by larger companies, such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and CorelDRAW. It has been better known in academic and commercial enterprises.\n\nThe Canvas software is used by engineers to document and share complex objects and systems. Some of the largest companies in the aerospace, defense and manufacturing markets use Canvas as an integral part of their documentation workflow. Canvas is fully committed to continue to develop our product line to meet the ever-changing requirements of our major customers.

Closely related to the Carolingian dynasty, it consisted of a Burgundian and a Swabian group. It has not been definitively clarified, however, whether the two groups formed one dynasty or whether they shared the same name by coincidence only. While the Elder House became extinct in the male line with the death of Duke Welf of Carinthia in 1055, his sister Kunigunde married into the Italian House of Este and became the ancestor of the (Younger) House of Welf.\n\nAccording to a family tradition, the ancestry of the Welfs can be traced back to the Skirian prince Edeko (d. 469), a confidant of King Attila the Hun, and to his son Odoacer, King of Italy from 476. Nevertheless, an early ancestor may have been the Frankish nobleman Ruthard (d. before 790), a count in the Argengau and administrator of the Carolingian king Pepin the Younger in Alamannia.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Welf\" (also \"Guelph\", from ) has not been conclusively established. A late medieval legend first documented in 1475 referred to a (non-historical) Duke Balthazar of Swabia, whose marriage had remained childless and who represented as his own heir and successor Bundus, the newborn son of one of his hunters. When Bundus came of age and was betrothed to a duchess of Guelders, his mother secretly informed him of the circumstances of his birth. The shocked young man waived both the duchess' hand and rule in Swabia. Retired, he spent the rest of his life at the Altdorf monastery. Only on his deathbed did he reveal the truth about his descendance and become known thenceforth as \"Herzog Wolf\" (Duke Wolf). Another popular version refers to the eleven (\"elf\") sons of one Count Isenbart of Altdorf, whose mother wanted them to be drowned and years later was faced with those among them who escaped death.\n\nThe older of the two groups was the Burgundian group. Its oldest known member was Welf, the first Count of Altdorf. He was mentioned in 819 as father of Empress Judith. The younger sons of the first count of Altdorf, Conrad and Rudolf accompanied their sister to the court of her husband, Louis the Pious, where their ambitious spirit maintained their hereditary rank, and where they shared the happy, as well as the adverse fortunes of that sister. When Judith was surprised and confined by her stepsons, her brothers were shaven as monks but claimed and obtained permission to stand beside the throne. Judith's sister Hemma (* 808 † 876) later married Judith's stepson Louis the German and became Queen of the Franks.\n\nConrad had two sons: Conrad II, who succeeded him; and Hugh, from his church preferment, styled \"the Abbot\". He is traditionally given a third son, Welf I of the Swabian group.\n\nConrad II succeeded his father as Count of Paris, and recovered the Burgundian estates of his grand-uncle Otkarius. He left an only son Rudolph who assumed the royal crown at the abbey of St Maurice en Valais in 888, who confirmed his independence with two victories over Arnulf, and was then acknowledged emperor in a general diet of the empire. His son, Rudolph II succeeded to this new-formed state, which included the French or western part of Switzerland, Franche-Comté, Savoy, Dauphiné, Provence, and the country between the Rhine and the Alps, and was known as the kingdom of Burgundy. He twice attempted the conquest of Italy, and for a period of three years governed that kingdom.\n\nHis son and successor, Conrad III, reigned more than fifty-six years from 937 to 993 and enjoyed the friendship and support of the Saxon emperors. Otto I married his sister Adelaide, who was the mother of Otto II, and the grandmother of Otto III. Conrad was succeeded by his son Rudolph III, surnamed \"the Lossy\". When Rudolph III died childless in 1032 without issue the sovereignty of the kingdom of Burgundy devolved as a fief or legacy to his nephew Conrad of Swabia, who was elected emperor in 1024. With Rudolph, this branch became extinct in the male line.\n\nThe last member of the Burgundian group was King Rudolph III of Burgundy, who died childless in 1032.\n\n\nThe oldest known member of the Swabian group was Welf I, a count in Swabia who was first mentioned in 842. According to legend, Welf I was a son of Conrad, son of Welf, count of Altdorf, the ancestor of the Burgundian group. This relationship is considered probable because both Conrad and Welf I were counts of Linzgau and Alpgau. The relationship between Welf I and all later members of the Swabian group (Welf, Duke of Carinthia, and his relatives, who were counts of Altdorf) is, again, known only through legend.\n\nThe Elder House of Welf became extinct when Welf, Duke of Carinthia, died childless in 1055. The property of the House of Welf was inherited by the elder branch of the House of Este that came to be known as the younger House of Welf, or House of Welf-Este.\n\n\n"}

He played as a catcher for thirteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1937 and 1954 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, and Boston Red Sox.\n\nIn a thirteen-season major league career, Owen posted a .255 batting average with 14 home runs and 378 RBI in 1209 games.\n\nOwen was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1935 and later on made his major league debut in 1937, appearing in 80 games, spending the next three full seasons in St. Louis before being traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers for catcher Gus Mancuso, a minor league player and $60,000.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Owen averaged 46 RBI a season for the Dodgers and played for the Brooklyn team which faced the New York Yankees in the 1941 World Series. During that championship season, he set a then-record for most consecutive errorless fielding chances by a catcher (508) and finished with a .995 fielding average. Yet, ironically, Owen is most remembered in baseball lore today for a costly mistake that he committed during that year's World Series. The Yankees held a 2-games-to-1 lead entering Game 4 on October 5 at the Dodgers' home field, Ebbets Field. With the Dodgers leading 4–3 and 2 outs for the Yankees in the top of the ninth inning and the count 3–2 on Tommy Henrich, Henrich swung and missed at strike 3, which would have been the final out of the game, but the ball eluded Owen and went to the backstop, allowing Henrich to make it safely to first base. The Yankees then rallied and scored four runs in the remainder of the inning and won the game 7–4. Instead of the series being tied, the victory gave the Yankees a 3–1 lead. The next day, they beat the Dodgers 3–1 in Game 5 and won the World Championship. The Dodgers did not return to the World Series until 1947 and didn't win the series until 1955.\n\nA four-consecutive All-Star from 1941 to 1944, in 1942 Owen became the first player to pinch-hit a home run in an All-Star game, and during the 1944 regular season, he became the third National League catcher to ever record an unassisted double play. Owen played for Brooklyn until the end of the 1945 season. He then served in the Navy at the end of World War II.\n\nAfter his discharge from the military in 1946, Owen expected to return to Brooklyn, but he failed to reach an agreement with the Dodgers and signed a contract to be a player-manager in the Mexican League. There were several other big leaguers who fled to Mexico, including Alex Carrasquel, Danny Gardella, Max Lanier, Sal Maglie, Luis Olmo and Vern Stephens, attracted by very good salaries. In retaliation for the defections, Commissioner Happy Chandler sought a lifetime suspension for all of them although his initial penalty was later reduced to three years.\n\nOwen returned to the majors in 1949 with the Chicago Cubs and played for them through the 1951 season. He finished his major league playing career with the Boston Red Sox in 1954.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Owen spent two seasons (1955–56) as a Red Sox coach, then worked for the Cubs as a scout.\n\nHe returned to the Ozarks and founded the Mickey Owen Baseball School on Route 66 near Miller, Missouri, in 1959. Owen sold the school in 1963, but remained an instructor until the 1980s. Notable alumni include Michael Jordan, Joe Girardi, Scott Siman and Charlie Sheen.\n\nIn 1964, Owen ran for Greene County sheriff and won. He also won three more elections, serving in office until 1981. Owen ran for Lt. Governor of Missouri in 1980 and finished third with 13% and 79038 votes. Owen was still playing in old timers' games in the 1980s.\n\nOwen lived the last years of his life in the Missouri Veterans Home in Mount Vernon. He died in Springfield, Missouri at age 89.\n\nIn his 1942 book \"Many Happy Returns: An Unofficial Guide to Your Income Tax Problems\", Groucho Marx — a lifelong Dodgers fan — referenced Owen's infamous World Series error: \n, or Retrosheet\n"}

It is a private club and therefore closed to guests not accompanied by a member. The golf course was designed by Robert Trent Jones and opened in 1962.\n\nHazeltine also hosts functions other than golf. The clubhouse has a ballroom and two restaurants.\n\nTotton P. Heffelfinger, a former president of the United States Golf Association, saw the opportunity to build a new championship golf course after The Minikahda Club in Minneapolis (where Chick Evans won the 1916 U.S. Open) was threatened by the development of a freeway. After that club rejected plans for a new course, Heffelfinger met with Robert Trent Jones to design the golf course.\n\nThe course was originally named \"The Executive Golf Club\" and was initially intended to be part of a series of Executive Golf Clubs around the country. However, the name was not favorable and the other clubs did not materialize. The founders decided to call the new course Hazeltine National Golf club in honor of the adjoining Lake Hazeltine. The course opened for play to club members in 1962. Heffelfinger's ultimate goal was to have major championships played at Hazeltine. He got that wish when the 1966 U.S. Women's Open was played at Hazeltine; Sandra Spuzich won with a score of 297 (nine over par) on a course set to .\n\nHazeltine hosted the U.S. Open in 1970 and the course received much negative press as many big names and nearly half the field didn't break 80 the first day. The weather had been very cool and windy. After his round on Friday, Dave Hill said that the only thing Hazeltine was missing was \"80 acres of corn and a few cows.\" Tony Jacklin (that year's reigning Open Championship winner) won the tournament with a seven-under-par 281. The course played to and Hill placed second.\n\nAfter that, the club faced severe financial troubles, and it looked unlikely that the club would host a major championship again. The club almost secured a deal to host a PGA Championship, but ultimately lost the opportunity. However, the course was awarded the U.S. Women's Open for 1977. This was the first year that Nancy Lopez played in the championship as a professional, and she placed second. Hollis Stacy won the event with a four-over-par score of 292 on a course set at .\n\nOver the next few years, the course received a series of renovations. A number of dogleg holes were straightened. The par three sixteenth hole was abandoned and a new par four was laid out along Hazeltine Lake. The par four seventeenth was converted to a par three, keeping the original green site. The 1983 U.S. Senior Open was held at the redesigned course. Billy Casper and Rod Funseth were tied after four rounds with scores of four-over-par 288 (the course played as a par 71). After he and Funseth were still tied at the end of an 18-hole playoff, Casper made a birdie on the first hole of sudden death to win. The course played to .\n\nThe course was awarded the 1991 U.S. Open in January 1986. Rees Jones, the son of Robert Trent Jones, made more changes to the course in preparation for the U.S. Open. The U.S. Open was remembered primarily for two things. One was the dramatic duel between Payne Stewart and Scott Simpson, who both finished at six-under-par 282. In the 18-hole playoff, Stewart was two strokes behind coming to the 16th hole. Then, as he had on Sunday, he rallied and won the U.S. Open for his second major championship win (and the first of his two U.S. Opens). Stewart made 57 pars during the 72 holes of regulation.\n\nThe 1991 U.S. Open is also remembered because of lightning that struck on Thursday, June 13, the first day of the championship. The day started out with bright blue skies, but a rainstorm soon came in. Spectators left the course or stood under trees for shelter. Six spectators stood under a tree near the famous sixteenth hole when lightning struck, with one fatality.\n\nIn 1994, the course hosted the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship, one of the major events in amateur golf. In that competition, Tim Jackson defeated Tommy Brennan with a final score of one up (the Mid-Amateur final is held at match play). The course measured at for that championship. In 2001 another amateur event, the USGA Men's State Team Championship, was held at Hazeltine. John Carlson, Jered Gusso, and John Harris comprised the Minnesota team which won that event with an even-par score of 432. The course played at .\n\nHazeltine also hosted the 1999 NCAA Division I Men's Championship. The Georgia Bulldogs won the team tournament with a twenty-seven-over-par score of 1179. Northwestern Wildcats golfer Luke Donald won the individual championship with a four-under-par score of 284. The course played to .\n\nRees Jones lengthened tees and added several new bunkers in preparation for the 84th PGA Championship in 2002. The course played at as a par 72. Rich Beem was the winner of the championship, with a score of ten-under-par 278, holding off a surging Tiger Woods, who birdied the last four holes. The course's competitive course record was set in the 2002 PGA Championship as Beem, Robert Allenby, and Justin Leonard all shot 66 (six-under-par) during the second round.\n\nIn 2006 the course hosted the U.S. Amateur, which was won by Richie Ramsay of Scotland by defeating John Kelly of USA with a score of 4 & 2.\n\nHazeltine again played host to the PGA Championship in 2009. The tournament was won by Y.E. Yang of South Korea. Yang prevailed by three strokes over Tiger Woods, who had led by two going into Sunday. Yang's victory was significant, as it was the first men's major won by a golfer born in Asia. It also marked the first time that Woods had lost a major after holding at least a share of first after 54 holes.\n\nThe 2016 Ryder Cup was awarded to Hazeltine in 2002 and was scheduled for September 27 – October 2. On February 24, 2015, Davis Love III was named captain for Team USA with Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke captaining Team Europe. The United States' 17–11 victory was their first victory in the event since 2008 at Valhalla and tied the record for the biggest American margin of victory on home soil set in 1979 at The Greenbrier, which was the first year that Great Britain and Ireland included continental Europe to create the current European team. \n\nOn March 26, 2018, Hazeltine National was announced as the host of the 2028 Ryder Cup. It will be the first American venue to host a second Ryder Cup.\n\nIn late June 2019, the club hosted, for the first time, the KPMG Women's PGA Championship. This event, established in the mid-1950s, is the second-oldest of the LPGA Tour's five major championships, and is conducted by the PGA of America.\n\nBolded years are major championships on the PGA Tour\n\nThe golf course is hilly, and it has narrow fairways and small greens. Nine of the holes have water hazards. The signature hole at Hazeltine is the par four sixteenth. The tee shot on the sixteenth must carry 220 yards (201 m) over Hazeltine Lake. The green is a raised peninsula which falls off on all sides, including into the hazard in the back and on the right.\n\nThe seventeenth is a long par three that used to be a short par four. Four bunkers and two water hazards guard the green, which is one of the most undulating on the entire course. The finishing hole is a long, well-bunkered par four.\n\nKeeping with the club's goal of improving the golf course as needed, a number of changes were made in the fall of 2005, including adding new tees (which will increase the length from the championship tees) and bunkers. The course was re-rated in 2006.\n\nPrior to the changes, from the championship tees, the course measured and had a rating of 77.0/153. From the blue tees, the course measures and has a rating of 75.4/150. From the gold tees, the course measures and has a rating of 73.7/146. From the white tees, the course measures and has a rating of 71.8/142 for men and 77.2/144 for women. From the red tees, the course measures and has a rating of 74.3/138 for women.\n\nDuring the 2008 summer, the club made many significant changes to the golf course in preparation for the 2009 PGA Championship. Some of these changes included adding bunkers onto the Par 4 2nd Hole; adding a new tee box on Hole 12, a par 4 which then played at almost ; and lengthening the course to . The rating was 78.0, and the slope was listed as 155.\n\n"}

He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1832 in Florence, Ohio. He was one of the members of Zion's Camp. He helped build the Kirtland, Nauvoo, Salt Lake, and Saint George temples. He served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ in England in the early 1840s. He led three wagon trains of pioneers from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley (1850, 1855, and 1861). He was a Bishop (Church of Jesus Christ) in Nauvoo, a Stake President in St. Louis, a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, and was serving as a Patriarch at his death.\n\nIn 1854, Andrus recommended that a new outfitting site for emigrants going to Utah be situated four miles west of the soon-to-be-town of Atchison, Kansas. Cholera at previous outfitting sites necessitated this new location. It was called Mormon Grove and was near the Missouri River and Atchison. Atchison needed laborers to build, and the emigrants needed work to earn money to outfit themselves for the overland trip to Utah—so this was a good place for an outfitting site. Milo Andrus oversaw the site in 1855. One hundred-sixty acres were obtained and a sod fence was built around it. Thirty to forty acres were planted so that the incoming emigrants would have food. The planted acreage was called the Perpetual Emigration Farm and soon Mormon Grove became a tent city. That year 2,041 people and 337 wagons left for Utah with Andrus leading one of the wagon trains. While in St. Louis, he preached many sermons. Among those who joined the church due to his preaching was Heinrich Eyring, who would later become a long-serving president of the Indian Territory Mission in Oklahoma, and who was the grandfather of the chemist Henry Eyring.\n\nAndrus was a major in the Nauvoo Legion during the Utah War and was a chaplain of the Utah State Legislature. He built many roads in Utah and Southern Idaho.\n\nLike many early Latter-day Saints, Andrus was a polygamist; he had eleven wives and fifty-seven children.\n\n\n"}

Chartered in 1877 and opened in 1878, it served as an outlet for coal trains on the Syracuse, Geneva and Corning Railroad to reach the main line of the New York Central. The Fall Brook Coal Company, which operated the Syracuse, Geneva and Corning, and the Lehigh Valley Railroad both used the line to deliver coal to Lyons. A branch of the New York Central since its completion, the Geneva and Lyons was formally absorbed by the New York Central in 1890.\n\nChartered on October 5, 1877, the Geneva and Lyons was built to improve the connections between the New York Central and the Syracuse, Geneva and Corning Railroad. The latter line was leased by the Fall Brook Coal Company, a major supplier of coal to the New York Central. The Fall Brook already connected to the Auburn Road of the New York Central at Geneva, but the new railroad allowed trains to run through Geneva directly to the main line of the New York Central at Lyons. This allowed the rerouting of coal traffic which was overloading the single track of the Auburn Road.\n\nConstruction of the Geneva and Lyons was underway by the spring of 1878. The first passenger train over the railroad ran on November 11, 1878, and was operated by the Fall Brook, continuing south to Corning. While the new railroad was owned and operated by the New York Central, which had advanced the funds for its construction, the Fall Brook continued to operate trains over the Geneva and Lyons and the Northern Central Railway also arranged for trackage rights over the railroad in 1878. George J. Magee, of the Fall Brook, was also a director of the Geneva and Lyons.\n\nCoal trestles or chutes were built for the New York Central's locomotives at Lyons, and in August 1879, of coal per day were shipped over the Geneva and Lyons to the trestles there. About were used to fuel locomotives at Lyons and the remainder shipped elsewhere on the New York Central system. By 1886, this amount had increased to in a month, both bituminous coal from the Fall Brook's mines and anthracite from connections southward. At the time, it was reported that the Lehigh Valley Railroad, was also running over the Geneva and Lyons to deliver coal. In January 1887, the coal shipments had increased again, to daily. In August 1881, work began to double-track the line. By April 1882, the double track had been finished from Geneva to Bennett's and from Lyons to Thompson's. However, the complete double-tracking was still unfinished in 1893. of the line, which totaled , had been double-tracked as of 1914.\n\nThe Geneva and Lyons was absorbed by the New York Central, which had operated it as a branch. The line was leased by the Fall Brook in 1893, but was itself taken over by the New York Central in 1899.\n\n"}

{"id": "2248622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248622", "title": "Mask of Agamemnon", "text": "Mask of Agamemnon\n\nThe Mask of Agamemnon is a gold funeral mask discovered at the ancient Greek site of Mycenae. The mask, displayed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, has been described by Cathy Gere as the \"\"Mona Lisa\" of prehistory\".\n\nGerman archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered the artifact in 1876, believed that he had found the body of the Mycenaean king Agamemnon, leader of the Achaeans in Homer's epic of the Trojan War, the \"Iliad\", but modern archaeological research suggests that the mask dates to about 1600 BC, predating the period of the legendary Trojan War by about 400 years.\n\nSchliemann found the mask in 1876 in a burial shaft designated Grave V at the site \"Grave Circle A, Mycenae\". The mask is one of five discovered in the royal shaft graves at Mycenae—three in Grave IV and two in Grave V. The faces and hands of two children in Grave III are covered with gold leaf, one covering having holes for the eyes. The mask was designed to be a funeral mask covered in gold.\n\nThe faces of the men are not all covered with masks. That they are men and warriors is suggested by the presence of weapons in their graves. The quantities of gold and carefully worked artifacts indicate honor, wealth and status. The custom of clothing leaders in gold leaf is known elsewhere. The Mask of Agamemnon was named by Schliemann after the legendary Greek king of Homer's \"Iliad\". This mask adorned one of the bodies in the shaft graves at Mycenae. Schliemann took this as evidence the Trojan War was a real historical event.\n\nThe mask of Agamemnon was created from a single thick gold sheet, heated and hammered against a wooden background with the details chased on later with a sharp tool. Following his discoveries at the site, Schliemann notified King George of Greece. He is supposed to have told the king in a telegraph, \"I have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon\". Schliemann later named his son after the legendary king. Close to the end of his life, the archaeologist accepted doubts as to the mask's true owner and is quoted as saying, \"So this is not Agamemnon ... these are not his ornaments? All right, let's call him Schulze.\"\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, the authenticity of the mask has been formally questioned, primarily by William Calder III and David Traill. \"Archaeology\" magazine has run a series of articles presenting both sides of the debate. By the time of the excavation of the Shaft Graves, the Greek Archaeological Society had taken a hand in supervising Schliemann's work (after the issues at Troy), sending Panagiotis Stamatakis as \"ephor\", or director, of the excavation, who kept a close eye on Schliemann.\n\nProponents of the fraud argument center their case on Schliemann's reputation for salting digs with artifacts from elsewhere. The resourceful Schliemann, they assert, could have had the mask manufactured on the general model of the other Mycenaean masks and found an opportunity to place it in the excavation.\n\nThe defending advocate(s) point out that the excavation was closed on November 26–27 for Sunday holiday and rain. It was not allowed to reopen until Stamatakis had provided the work with credible witnesses. The three other masks were not discovered until the 28th. The Mask of Agamemnon was found on the 30th.\n\nA second critique is based on style. The Mask of Agamemnon differs from three of the other masks in a number of points: it is three-dimensional rather than flat, one of the facial hairs is cut out, rather than engraved, the ears are cut out, the eyes are depicted as both open and shut, with open eyelids, but a line of closed eyelids across the center, the face alone of all the depictions of faces in Mycenaean art has a full pointed beard with handlebar mustache, the mouth is well-defined (compared to the flat masks), the brows are formed to two arches rather than one.\n\nThe defense presented prior arguments that the shape of the lip, the triangular beard and the detail of the beard are nearly the same as the mane and locks of the gold lion-head rhyton from Shaft Grave IV. Schliemann's duplicity, they claim, has been greatly exaggerated, and they also claim that the attackers were conducting a vendetta.\n\nModern archaeological research suggests that the mask is genuine but predates the period of the Trojan War by 300–400 years. Others date the contents of the find even earlier, to approximately 2500 BC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248623", "title": "Sulfone", "text": "Sulfone\n\nA sulfone is a chemical compound containing a sulfonyl functional group attached to two carbon atoms. The central hexavalent sulfur atom is double-bonded to each of two oxygen atoms and has a single bond to each of two carbon atoms, usually in two separate hydrocarbon substituents.\n\nSulfones are typically prepared by organic oxidation of thioethers, often referred to as sulfides. Sulfoxides are intermediates in this route. For example, dimethyl sulfide oxidizes to dimethyl sulfoxide and then to dimethyl sulfone.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a convenient and widely used source of the sulfonyl functional group. Specifically, Sulfur dioxide participates in cycloaddition reactions with dienes.\nThe industrially useful solvent sulfolane is prepared by addition of sulfur dioxide to buta-1,3-diene followed by hydrogenation of the resulting sulfolene.\n\nSulfones are prepared under conditions used for Friedel–Crafts reactions using sources of RSO derived from sulfonyl halides and sulfonic acid anhydrides. Lewis acid catalysts such as AlCl and FeCl are required.\n\nSulfones have been prepared by nucleophilic displacement of halides by sulfinates: \n\nSulfone is a relatively inert functional group, being weakly basic (compared to sulfoxides). They are non-oxidizing. In the Ramberg–Bäcklund reaction and the Julia olefination, sulfones are converted to alkenes by the elimination of sulfur dioxide.\n\nSulfolane is used to extract valuable aromatic compounds from petroleum.\n\nSome polymers containing sulfone groups are useful engineering plastics. They exhibit high strength and resistance to oxidation, corrosion, high temperatures, and creep under stress. For example, some are valuable as replacements for copper in domestic hot water plumbing. Precursors to such polymers are the sulfones bisphenol S and 4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone.\n\nExamples of sulfones in pharmacology include dapsone, a drug formerly used as an antibiotic to treat leprosy, dermatitis herpetiformis, tuberculosis, or pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Several of its derivatives, such as promin, have similarly been studied or actually been applied in medicine, but in general sulfones are of far less prominence in pharmacology than for example the sulfonamides.\n\n"}
{"id": "2248626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248626", "title": "Ed Sullivan Theater", "text": "Ed Sullivan Theater\n\nThe Ed Sullivan Theater is a theater located at 1697–1699 Broadway, between West 53rd and West 54th, in the Theater District in Manhattan, New York City. The theater has been used as a venue for live and taped CBS broadcasts since 1936.\n\nIt is historically known as the home of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and the site of both Elvis Presley's second and third appearances on it (his first appearance was filmed remotely at CBS Studio Center in Hollywood,) as well as The Beatles' debut performance in the United States. Since 1993, it has been home to CBS' late night talk show, \"The Late Show.\" CBS began using the theater during David Letterman's tenure as host, and Stephen Colbert retained it when he took over the show in 2015. It is on the National Register of Historic Places, and the interior has been designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nThe 13-story, brown brick and terra cotta office building with a ground-floor theater was designed by architect Herbert J. Krapp. It was built by Arthur Hammerstein between 1925 and 1927, and was named Hammerstein's Theatre after his father, Oscar Hammerstein I. The neo-Gothic interior contains pointed-arch stained-glass windows with scenes from the elder Hammerstein's opera productions. The first production at the theater was the three-hour musical \"Golden Dawn\", the second male lead of which was Cary Grant, then still using his birth name, Archie Leach. Arthur Hammerstein went bankrupt in 1931, and lost ownership of the building.\n\nIt later went by the name Manhattan Theatre, Billy Rose's Music Hall, and the Manhattan once again. In the 1930s, it became a nightclub. After CBS obtained a long-term lease on the property, the radio network began broadcasting from there in 1936, moving in broadcast facilities it had leased at NBC Studios in Radio City. Architect William Lescaze renovated the interior, keeping nearly all of the Krapp design but covering many walls with smooth white panels, his work earning praise from the magazine \"Architectural Forum\". The debut broadcast was the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\". The theater had various names during the network's tenancy, including Radio Theater #3 and the CBS Radio Playhouse. It was converted for television in 1950, when it became CBS-TV Studio 50. In the early and mid-Fifties, the theater played host to many of the live telecasts of \"The Jackie Gleason Show.\"\n\nNewspaper columnist and impresario Ed Sullivan, who had started hosting his variety show \"Toast of the Town\", soon renamed \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", from the Maxine Elliott Theatre (CBS Studio 51) on West 39th Street in 1948, moved to Studio 50 a few years later. The theater was officially renamed for Sullivan at the end of his \"20th Anniversary Celebration\" telecast on December 10, 1967.\n\nIn the 1960s, Studio 50 was one of CBS' busiest stages, used not only for Sullivan's program but also for \"The Merv Griffin Show\", as well as several game shows. In 1965, Studio 50 was converted to color, and the first color episode of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" debuted from the theater on October 31, 1965. (The program originated from CBS Television City in color for the previous six weeks while the color equipment was installed. One earlier color episode of the program originated from Studio 72 at Broadway and 81st on August 22, 1954.) \"What's My Line?,\" \"To Tell the Truth\" and \"Password\" also called the studio home after CBS began broadcasting regularly in color; previously, they had been taped around the corner at CBS-TV Studio 52, which later became the disco Studio 54. The first episode of regular color telecasts of \"What's My Line?\" was broadcast live on September 11, 1966. \"Line\" and \"Truth\" remained at Studio 50 even after they moved from CBS to first-run syndication in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe Ed Sullivan Theater was also the first home for \"The $10,000 Pyramid,\" with its huge end-game board set at the rear of the stage, in 1973. Other short-lived game shows produced at the Ed included \"Musical Chairs\" with singer Adam Wade (1975), \"Shoot For The Stars\" with Geoff Edwards (1977) (which was an NBC show), and \"Pass the Buck\" with Bill Cullen (1978).\n\nThe CBS lease on the building expired in 1981 and it became a Reeves Entertainment teletape facility. As such it hosted the sitcom \"Kate & Allie\", which ran from 1984 to 1989 (as it happened, on CBS), as well as the early Nickelodeon talk show \"Livewire\". In 1990, David Niles/1125 Productions signed onto the lease, with the theater to house his HDTV studio and new Broadway show \"Dreamtime\". On October 17, 1992, an NBC special celebrating Phil Donahue's 25 years on television taped in the theater. The following month, NBC News used the theater for its November 1992 election night coverage.\n\nWhen David Letterman switched networks from NBC to CBS, CBS bought the theater in February 1993 from Winthrop Financial Associates of Boston for $4.5 million, as the broadcast location for his new show, \"Late Show with David Letterman\". The existing tenant, Niles' \"Dreamtime\", was given four weeks to vacate. Due to the economics of moving the show and the lack of a comparable available Broadway theater, \"Dreamtime\" closed. The quick sale and vacancy of the building earned the realtor the Henry Hart Rice Achievement Award for the Most Ingenious Deal of the Year for 1993.\n\nThe theater was reconfigured into a studio, with lighting and sound adjustments; the number of seats was reduced from 1,200 to 400. During the renovation the stained glass windows were removed and stored by CBS in an arrangement with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; the window openings were covered with acoustic material. The architectural firm that did the work, Polshek Partnership, notes on its web site that \"to preserve the architectural integrity of the landmark, all interventions are reversible.\"\n\nIn 2005, it took nearly four months to retrofit the theater with the cabling and equipment necessary to broadcast high definition television.\n\nLetterman's production company Worldwide Pants had its offices in the theater's office building from 1993 until shortly after the conclusion of Letterman hosting \"Late Show\" in 2015.\n\nLetterman's successor, Stephen Colbert, continues to broadcast \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" from the Ed Sullivan Theater, although extensive renovations were made between the two hosts' tenures. Removal of the Letterman set took place only a few hours after his last show, on May 20, 2015. Letterman's marquee was also removed, and was temporarily replaced by a banner promoting the Angelo's Pizza restaurant adjacent to the theater, featuring Colbert posing with a slice of pizza.\n\nThe theater underwent a full restoration to its original 1927 splendor, including the exposure of the theater's dome, which had been covered up by air ducts and sound buffers, the re-installation of the original stained-glass windows, which had been removed and placed in storage during the Letterman era, and the restoration of a wooden chandelier with individual stained-glass chambers that house its bulbs. The restoration was made possible due to advances in technology that allowed less sound and video equipment to cover up the auditorium's architectural details. CBS executive Richard Hart explained that Colbert was initially hesitant to use the theater, but called for the restoration after he was informed about the dome while touring the facility.\n\nColbert described his new set as being \"intimate\"; it features a multi-tier design, with extensive use of LED lighting and video projection backdrops, and a larger desk area than that of Letterman. Exposed for the new show, the Sullivan's dome is lit up with a digital projection system which is used to display images above the theater, such as a kaleidoscopic pattern featuring images of Colbert's face and the CBS logo. New, larger audience seats were installed, reducing the overall capacity from 461 to 370 . The theater's new marquee was designed to have a \"glitzy\" appearance appropriate for Broadway; CBS late-night executive Vincent Favale joked that Colbert's marquee made the new rear marquee installed at 30 Rockefeller Plaza for \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" as part of the re-signage from the GE Building to the Comcast Building look like a mall kiosk in comparison.\n\nThe theatre served as a stage for \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" for a week of shows in October 1996 when several eighth-floor studios at NBC's 30 Rockefeller Center headquarters experienced complications from an electrical fire.\n\nThe theatre has hosted most of the New York-based finales for the reality game show \"Survivor\". The Ed Sullivan Theater was first used for \"\" (as a contingency plan due to rain scrubbing plans for a live finale outdoors in Central Park) and was subsequently used for every even-numbered season from \"\" to \"\".\n\nIn the 21st century, the theater has hosted roof-top or marquee-top concerts by a few musicians:\n\nOn February 9, 2014, the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' first \"Ed Sullivan\" performance, CBS News hosted a roundtable discussion at the theater. Anthony Mason moderated the panel, which consisted of Pattie Boyd, Neil Innes, Mick Jones, Tad Kubler, John Oates, Andrew Oldham, Nile Rodgers and Julie Taymor. A replica of the marquee to the theater as it looked the night of the original performance also covered up the Late Show with David Letterman marquee over the weekend. David Letterman interviewed Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in the theater as part of a related Grammy tribute special which aired on CBS around the same time.\n\n\"CBS This Morning\" temporarily relocated to the Ed Sullivan Theater on March 19, 2020, utilizing a portable desk located center stage away from Colbert's desk set and the band's setup; its normal facilities at the CBS Broadcast Center were shut down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, after several CBS News staffers tested positive for the novel coronavirus. \"The Late Show\" was in production hiatus at the time due to the pandemic; \"Late Show\" executive producer Chris Licht had earlier served the same role for \"CBS This Morning\". An earlier incarnation of \"CBS This Morning\" broadcast a week of shows from the theater in May 1995, while \"Late Show\" was taping in London.\n\n"}

Meise presented his review to the Eighth International Ornithological Congress (IOC) in Oxford. The review listed 600 new species' names described in that period. Meise was of the opinion that between 135 and 200 represented good species.

Two species are currently recognized: \"U. anceps\" from the United States during the Early to Middle Eocene (56-38 million years ago) and \"U. insperatus\" of Middle to Late Eocene (48-34 million years ago) China.\n\n\"Uintatherium\" was a large browsing animal. With a length of about 4 m (13 ft), a height of 1.70 m (5.6 ft), and a weight up to 2 tonnes, it was similar to today's rhinoceros, both in size and in shape, although they are not closely related. Its legs were robust to sustain the weight of the animal and were equipped with hooves. Moreover, a Uintathere's sternum was made up of horizontal segments, unlike today's rhinos, which have compressed vertical segments.\n\nIts most unusual feature was the skull, which is both large and strongly built, but simultaneously flat and concave: this feature is rare and, apart from some brontotheres, not regularly characteristic of any other known mammal. Its cranial cavity was exceptionally small due the walls of the cranium being exceedingly thick. The weight of the skull was mitigated by numerous sinuses permeating the walls of the cranium, like those in an elephant's skull.\n\nThe large upper canine teeth might have served as formidable defensive weapons, and superficially resembled those of saber-toothed cats. Sexually dimorphic, the teeth were larger in males than in females. However, they also might have used them to pluck the aquatic plants from marshes that seem to have comprised their diet.\n\nThe skulls of the males bore six prominent knob-like ossicones that grew from the frontal region of the skull. The function of these structures is unknown. They may have been of use in defense and/or sexual display.\n\nThe fossils of \"Uintatherium\" are among the largest and most impressive of the finds at the excavation of Fort Bridger in Wyoming, and were a focal point of the Bone Wars between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Between them, Marsh and Cope claimed the discovery of \"U. anceps\" specimens as discoveries of new species on twenty-two separate occasions (and therefore, originally gave these specimens many different names aside from \"Uintatherium anceps\").\n\nFossils of \"U. anceps\" have been found in the Bridger and Wakashie rock formations, in the states of Wyoming and Utah near the Uinta Mountains, which are commemorated in the generic name. An almost intact skull of \"U. insperatus\" was found in the lower part of the Lushi Formation of the Lushi Basin in Henan Province, China.\n\nA cast of a \"Uintatherium\" skeleton is on display at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park. The skeleton of \"Uintatherium\" is also on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n\n"}

The gang and Cathy mention to Steed that the bikes also failed and mention two old sisters, Cynthia and Ermyntrude Peck, living in an old watermill, who warn the gang away from the area and threaten to cast a spell on them. Steed organizes a rally cross at night with a £25 prize. The two old ladies in hearing the noisy bikes then appear to do something with a jamming device which makes the bikes fail and again make reference to their witchcraft. The sisters catch a large mouse and put it in a bag as Steed arrives to visit them, claiming to be an \"inspector of the National Distrust\" and inspects the place.\n\nSteed meets with the operator of the atomic plant who mentions that he believes the sisters to be the daughters of a late nuclear scientist of considerable renown. The daughters investigate the \"National Distrust\" in their directories and realize Steed is a spy. Steed revisits and battles with an assailant outside the mill and discovers the body of the atomic plant operator. Later, Dave, a gang member, tells Cathy that he has investigated the mill and has discovered the lock on one of the side doors is faulty which gives Steed and Cathy a chance to investigate whilst the sisters are at church. As Steed is about to leave the bar to visit the mill he is chatted up by a woman who offers him a whisky and drugs it and asks why he is interested in the old mill. Steed detects that it has been drugged, pours it behind his back and pretends to be knocked out, and then departs when the woman leaves the room. Cathy and Dave arrives at the mill first and enter and discover the jamming device. At that moment \"Dave\" removes his helmet and is discovered to be an imposter. Dave is later found tied up in the barn in which the motorcycle gang have been partying. The woman who attempted to drug Steed arrives with another accomplice and when the sisters return it appears that it is a gang attempting to steal their secret jamming system. Steed arrives as Cathy fends off the gang who flee leaving a distraught Cynthia who has to come to terms with the gang taking her \"mousestrap\" which she had spent all her life perfecting, only to then find the trap subdues the leader of the gang as he attempts to leave and is returned safely to her.\n\n\nProduction for the episode was completed on 28 August 1963.\n\nDoug Pratt describes the episode as \"an enjoyable blend of absurd components\".\n\n"}

Despite World War II the station was opened on time. Later in 1978 the platform was lengthened. This part is in a more modern style than the rest of the station.\n\nThe station honors the Soviet fighting men with its heavy ornamentation. The architects, I. Taranov and N.

Frolov on the theme of wartime industry and bas-reliefs running along the base of the ceiling (by artists N.V. Tomsky, A.E. Zelensky, S.M. Rabinovich, and N.M. Shtamm) depicting the soldiers of the Red Army in combat. The pink and white marble pylons are also decorated with cast-bronze portraits of Russian war heroes like Mikhail Kutuzov and Alexander Nevsky. Floor lamps, long since replaced with more up-to-date lighting in other Metro stations, still give Novokuznetskaya an atmosphere of brooding shadow.\n\nThere is an urban legend that the station's ornate benches were made of Carrara marble taken from the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour just before it was demolished (in 1931), but it is not true, and the marble was from Ural, not Italy.\n\nNovokuznetskaya's round entrance vestibule is located off Pyatnitskaya Street, north of the intersection with Klimentovsky Street.\n\nFrom this station it is possible to transfer to Tretyakovskaya, a cross-platform station serving both the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line and the Kalininskaya Line.\n\n"}
{"id": "2248653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248653", "title": "Cardinals–Cubs rivalry", "text": "Cardinals–Cubs rivalry\n\nThe Cardinals–Cubs rivalry, also called the Route 66 rivalry and The I-55 rivalry, refers to the rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs of the National League (NL), one of the most bitter rivalries in Major League Baseball and in all of North American professional sports. The Cardinals have won 19 NL pennants, while the Cubs have won 17. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to World Series success, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. Games between the two clubs see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis's Busch Stadium or Chicago's Wrigley Field. When the NL split into two divisions in , and later three divisions in , the Cardinals and Cubs remained together.\n\nThe Cubs lead the regular season series 1,237–1,180–19. The teams' lone MLB playoff meeting occurred in the 2015 National League Division Series, which the Cubs won, 3–1.\n\nIn May 2019, MLB announced that the Cubs and Cardinals would play a two-game series in London in June 2020, as the 2020 MLB London Series. On April 1, 2020, MLB announced the series was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his book, \"Before They Were Cardinals\", Jon David Cash speculates that the economic trade rivalry between the cities of Chicago and St. Louis led to the formation of the St. Louis Brown Stockings in 1875 to compete with the Chicago White Stockings. The Brown Stockings would later fold and reemerge in 1882 when the Cardinals (as the Browns), met the Cubs (as the White Stockings), in a pair of pre-World Series matchups between American Association champion St. Louis and NL champion Chicago.\n\nThe first series meeting between the two teams was actually played in four cities – not only St. Louis and Chicago, but also Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. On October 15, Browns manager Charles Comiskey pulled his team off the field in the 6th inning in protest of umpire Dave Sullivan's call. The White Stockings were in the lead at the time 5-4 and were declared a winner on forfeit. Behind pitcher Dave Foutz, St. Louis defeated Chicago 13-4 in Game 7. The Browns claimed the Game 2 forfeit didn't count and therefore claimed the championship. The two clubs split the $1000 prize.\n\nThe first series played in 1885 ended in dispute with no winner making the rematch a year later more heated. Game 2 saw the Browns win in a 12-0 romp. Bob Caruthers pitched a one-hitter, and left fielder Tip O'Neill smacked two inside-the-park home runs. It was the first two-home-run game by a player in a World Championship game. Despite the win, the White Stockings had won Games 1 and 3 and took the series lead into St. Louis. Oddities happened in Game 5. With Jim McCormick and Jocko Flynn lame and John Clarkson tired‚ Chicago tried to use a minor league recruit in the pitcher's box‚ only to be refused by the Browns. Shortstop Ned Williamson and right fielder Jimmy Ryan ended up having to pitch. The Browns won easily 10-3. The sixth and final game began at an earlier time of 2:18 PM, so the full nine innings could be played. Pitching his fourth game in six days‚ Clarkson held St. Louis hitless for six innings as Chicago built a 3-0 lead. However, in the 8th, the Browns finally got to Clarkson to tie the game at 3, with Arlie Latham hitting a 2-run triple. In the 10th, Curt Welch scored on the \"$15‚000 slide\" after a wild pitch to win it in front of a fired-up St. Louis home crowd.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the American Association, the Browns franchise moved to the National League in 1892 and become known as the Cardinals in 1900. (The Browns name was later used by an AL team that had previously been known as the Milwaukee Brewers, and is now the Baltimore Orioles.) St. Louis would not achieve much success in its early years in the NL. On the other hand, the Cubs won three straight pennants from 1906–1908 and two World Series during that time. The Cubs would also go on to win seven more pennants from then until 1945.\n\nThe Cardinals would eventually put together a team to win the pennant and World Series in . It would be their first National League pennant and first championship since defeating the White Stockings. Although the Cubs would also win a few pennants, their championship run stopped in . Eventually, the Cubs' pennant wins would also stop in 1945, and they did not win another until , when they also won the World Series. The Cardinals have won the World Series 11 times, the most of any National League team and second New York Yankees (27) in all of MLB.\n\nCubs' Slugger Hack Wilson had a combative streak and frequently initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a riot broke out in the ninth inning at Wrigley Field when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in Wilson's favor.\n\nOne game in particular was cited for putting Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, as well as the 1984 Cubs in general, \"on the map\", a NBC national telecast of a Cardinals–Cubs game on June 23, . The Cubs had been playing well throughout the season's first few months, but as a team unaccustomed to winning, they had not yet become a serious contender in the eyes of most baseball fans.\n\nSandberg had played two full seasons in the major leagues, and while he had proven himself to be a top-fielding second baseman and fast on the basepaths (over 30 stolen bases both seasons), his .260-ish batting average and single-digit home run production were respectable for his position but not especially noteworthy, and Sandberg was not talked about outside Chicago. The \"Game of the Week\", however, put the sleeper Cubs on the national stage against their regional rival, the St. Louis Cardinals. Both teams were well-established franchises with a strong fan base outside the Chicago and St. Louis area.\n\nIn the ninth inning, the Cubs trailed 9–8, and faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, Bruce Sutter. Sutter was at the forefront of the emergence of the closer in the late 1970s and early 1980s: a hard-throwing pitcher who typically came in just for the ninth inning and saved around 30 games a season. (Sutter was especially dominant in 1984, saving 45 games.) However, in the ninth inning, Sandberg, not yet known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer. Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. As Cubs' radio announcer Harry Caray described it: \n\nThe Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning. The Cardinals' Willie McGee (who had hit for the cycle that day) had already been named NBC's player of the game before Sandberg's first home run. As NBC play-by-play man Bob Costas (who called the game with Tony Kubek) said when Sandberg hit that second home run, \"\"Do you believe it?!\"\" The game is sometimes called \"The Sandberg Game\". The winning run for the Cubs was driven in by a single off the bat of Dave Owen.\n\nIn 1998, the teams were connected by the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race, credited by many with revitalizing the sport following the players' strike which cancelled the 1994 World Series and the first part of the 1995 season.\n\nIn early September the teams met for a two-game series in St. Louis. In the first game, McGwire hit his record-tying 61st home run off pitcher Mike Morgan in the first inning as part of a 3–2 Cardinals victory. The following day, McGwire broke the record with #62 off Steve Trachsel in the fourth inning as part of a 6–3 victory. In a show of sportsmanship, Sammy Sosa embraced and congratulated his rival and on-field opponent after McGwire rounded the bases. McGwire would finish the year with 70 home runs and Sosa with 66. However, the Cubs won the National League wild card, making the playoffs for the first time in nine years, while the Cardinals missed the playoffs. Sosa eventually became the NL MVP that season.\n\nSosa dedicated each of his 66 home runs that season to the memory of Cubs (and former Cardinals) broadcaster Harry Caray, who died in February that year.\n\nA somber showing of acknowledgment between the two teams happened in when Cubs catcher Joe Girardi addressed the fans at Wrigley Field in a choked up way that the game between the two teams had been cancelled and that the fans should pray for the St. Louis Cardinals family. However, there were fans who booed. Later, a press conference was held where an emotional Girardi addressed the death of Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kile. Girardi, who played for both the Cubs and the Cardinals, addressed the fans in a regional broadcast on Fox.\n\nIn 2005, Cubs first basemen Derrek Lee Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols were locked in an MVP race. Lee led the NL in hits and batting average and bested Pujols in home runs. For his part, Pujols led the league in runs scored and had the edge on Lee in RBIs. Lee was awarded both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger as the best NL first baseman on both defense and offense, respectively. However, with the Cardinals winning 100 games and the division and the Cubs finishing 21 games back in fourth place, Pujols won the MVP honors.\n\nOn June 4 and 5, Pujols, in his final season with the Cardinals, won back to back games against the Cubs with walk-off home runs.\n\nIn recent years, tragedies in the Cardinals organization have caused two games between these teams to be postponed. In 2002, after Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kile was found dead in a Chicago hotel room, a game between the teams in Wrigley Field was postponed. Then in 2007, another Cardinals pitcher, Josh Hancock, was killed in a car crash while driving intoxicated, causing a game in St. Louis to be postponed.\n\nFormer Cubs shortstop Ryan Theriot, who was acquired by the Cardinals on November 30, 2010, told a St. Louis radio station that he was \"finally on the right side of the Cardinals-Cubs rivalry\" and that he was happy to be with an organization that emphasized winning World Series championships instead of being \"an afterthought\". Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano called him \"the enemy now.\" The Cardinals won the World Series that season.\n\nThe two clubs played each other in the postseason for the first time in the 2015 National League Division Series, as a result of the Cubs' 4–0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL Wild Card Game. The Cubs defeated the Cardinals 3–1 to advance to the National League Championship Series.\n\nThe rivalry was further heated after John Lackey and Jason Heyward signed with the Cubs after the 2015 season and Dexter Fowler signed with the Cardinals after the Cubs' 2016 championship season.\n\nPrior to the regular season, Allstar Kris Bryant made controversial comments about the city of St. Louis saying \"Who would want to play in St. Louis? So boring.\" Catcher Yadier Molina responded on Twitter by verbally attacking Bryant directly.\n\nWhen the Tribune Company bought the Cubs, they immediately started pressing for night baseball, threatening to abandon Wrigley Field otherwise. Night baseball was finally added in 1988, and after some further negotiations with the city, in the winter of 2005–2006 they expanded Wrigley's bleachers for the first time since 1938.\n\nWrigleyville, a part of the Lakeview neighborhood, surrounds the Cubs' stadium, and comprises middle- and upper-middle-class housing, as well as many restaurants, bars and music venues for fans to visit before and after games.\n\nBusch Stadium (also referred to informally as \"New Busch Stadium\" or \"Busch Stadium III\") is the home of the St. Louis Cardinals. The stadium has a seating capacity of 43,975, and contains 3,706 club seats and 61 luxury suites.\n\nThe ballpark opened on April 4, 2006 with an exhibition between the minor league Memphis Redbirds and Springfield Cardinals, both affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals, which Springfield won 5-3 with right-hander Mike Parisi recording the first win. The first official major league game occurred on April 10, 2006 as the Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 6–4 behind an Albert Pujols home run and winning pitcher Mark Mulder.\n\nA commercial area, dubbed Ballpark Village, is adjacent to the stadium over the remainder of the former stadium's footprint.\n\nIn his book \"Three Nights in August\", Buzz Bissinger compared the Cardinals–Cubs rivalry to another famous rivalry in MLB: \"\"The Red Sox and Yankees is a tabloid-filled soap opera about money and ego and sound bites. But the Cubs and Cardinals are about... geography and territorial rights.\"\"\n\nOne of the \"territories\" in question is central Illinois, which receives both radio broadcasts of Cardinals games on KMOX, while WGN radio & WGN television,(including WGN-TV's superstation) broadcasts Cubs games. Both KMOX and WGN radio are traditional \"clear channel\" AM radio stations, and both teams fought for fans in the Western states prior to Major League expansion. Also prior to Major League expansion, the Cardinals traditionally claimed huge parts of the Lower Midwest and the South in their territory, while the Cubs claimed the Upper Midwest.\n\nLoyalties to the two teams divided friends, families, and co-workers, and shaped the locals in various ways, as George Will noted in a 1998 commencement address at Washington University in St. Louis: \"\"I grew up in Champaign, Illinois, midway between Chicago and St. Louis. At an age too tender for life-shaping decisions, I made one. While all my friends were becoming Cardinals fans, I became a Cub fan. My friends, happily rooting for Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst, and other great Redbirds, grew up cheerfully convinced that the world is a benign place, so of course, they became liberals. Rooting for the Cubs in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I became gloomy, pessimistic, morose, dyspeptic and conservative. It helped out of course that the Cubs last won the World Series in 1908, which is two years before Mark Twain and Tolstoy died. But that means, class of 1998, that the Cubs are in the 89th year of their rebuilding effort, and remember, any team can have a bad moment.\"\"\n\nThe rivalry between the two teams is an important regionalism in the Netflix show Ozark. In order to establish Jason Bateman's character, Marty Byrde, as a Chicago native now moved to Lake Ozark, Missouri, the show writers included several references to the rivalry through the first seasons. This often manifests as negative comments from Byrde to a southern Missouri Cardinals fan. One says to him \"I was raised to hate the Cubs,\" to which he fires back \"And I was raised to hate the Cardinals.\" \n\nMany players have played for both teams, including Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby, who holds several single season hitting records for both clubs. Notably, Hall of Famer Lou Brock was traded from the Cubs to the Cardinals early in his career for pitcher Ernie Broglio. This is widely considered one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history. Other Hall of Famers who played/managed with both clubs include Grover Cleveland Alexander, Clark Griffith, Burleigh Grimes, Bruce Sutter, Roger Bresnahan, Dizzy Dean, Dennis Eckersley, Rabbit Maranville, Hoyt Wilhelm, and Leo Durocher.\n\nLegendary announcer Harry Caray began his career in St. Louis, broadcasting on KMOX radio for 24 seasons, before moving to Chicago in 1971, announcing 11 seasons for the White Sox before moving to the North Side and becoming a staple of WGN radio and television broadcasts for the Cubs from 1982 until his death before the 1998 season.\n\nThe rivalry between the two clubs intensified following the hiring of Dusty Baker to manage the Cubs following in 2003. In 2002, when Baker was managing the San Francisco Giants, he and Cardinals manager Tony La Russa had run-ins during that year's National League Championship Series, with the animosity carrying over to Baker's tenure with the Cubs. According to Baker, part of the intensity stems from the close relationship of the two. \"\"It's very intense...When you play 18 times against a team that's had a long-time rivalry, and my former manager and my former confidant, that just increases things.\"\" Baker played for La Russa in 1986 as a member of the Oakland Athletics.\n\nSome say that the feud between the two managers added to the rivalry between the two teams. \"\"Both managers are fiercely protective of their players. Both believe in old-school baseball protocol. Neither will sit by idly and watch an opponent show up their team. Both are fierce competitors with enormous pride…. Fans don’t usually buy tickets to watch managers manage . . . but this tactical showdown added something to the Cubs-Cards series.\"\"\n\nAfter the Cubs fired Baker in 2006, they replaced him with Lou Piniella. Coincidentally, Piniella and La Russa both grew up in Tampa and faced each other in the 1990 World Series as managers of the Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics, respectively.\n\n\"As of the beginning of the 2019 MLB Season\"\n\n\"As of the beginning of the 2019 MLB Season\"\n\n\"Cardinals\" – \"(12)\"\n\n\"Cubs\" – \"(12)\"\n\n\n"}

Although the motorcycle has a sporty appearance, it offers a more standard, upright riding position with greater comfort and versatility. It provides a combination of performance and low operating costs, which has made it a favorite as a first motorcycle with new riders and popular with experienced riders on a budget. 2009 was the last model year for the Ninja 500.\n\nGiven that it was Kawasaki's best-selling sporty bike for a number of years, the EX500 is a popular mount for road racing, offering low price and availability of spare parts. It also offers a wide but forgiving performance envelope suitable for new riders or even veteran club racers, eschewing the significantly higher expense of campaigning 600 cc or larger supersport machines. In its latter years, the long-running (now-defunct) Production Twins class of the LRRS racing organization in New Hampshire was composed primarily of essentially stock EX500's. The United States Classic Racing Association retains a similar class, and in 2014 CCS Racing created the 500 SuperSport class, which has a competitive class for relatively stock EX500's to race against similar machinery.\n\nIts marketing name was changed in 1994 from \"EX500\" to \"Ninja 500\"; the \"R\" suffix was added in 1998. In Europe it was sold as the \"GPZ500S\".\n\nA partial redesign of the 500 was done in 1994. The changes made include the following:\n\n\n\nThe EX500 and Ninja 500 have been reviewed by motorcycle magazines, separately and in comparison to other motorcycles, from time to time. Upon its introduction, the EX500 was reviewed in the January 1987 issue of \"Cycle\" magazine. With a manufacturer's suggested retail price, as of October 1, 1986, of $2899, the EX500 led \"Cycle\" to pronounce, \"[o]n price alone, the EX is peerless.\"\n\nIn February 1992, \"Cycle World\" magazine, in an article titled \"Bargain Blasters,\" compared the EX500 to the Yamaha Seca II, the Suzuki Bandit, and the Suzuki GS500. The Seca II came in first, with the Bandit, the EX500, and the GS500 following in that order.\n\nIn April 1994, in an article titled \"Bargain Hunters,\" \"Cycle World\" compared the then-new Ninja 500 to the Suzuki GS500E, the Suzuki Katana 600, the Yamaha FZR600, and the Yamaha Seca II. Cycle World concluded of the EX500, \"it's our pick as the best overall deal in this group,\" though each bike had its virtues.\n\n\n"}

The Parish of Winscombe and Sandford, centred on the Parish Church of Church of St James the Great, includes the villages/hamlets of Barton, Hale, Oakridge, Nye, Sidcot and Woodborough.\n\nWinscombe has a few shops and businesses focused in the centre of the village, along Woodborough Road and Sandford Road. There is a doctor's surgery in the village, a vet and two dentists.\n\nWest of the village is the Max Bog biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name means a valley belonging to a Saxon named Wine.\n\nThe parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred.\n\nWinscombe was the subject of a historical and archaeological study led by Professor Mick Aston, published in the \"Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society\".\n\nFrom 1894 to 1974 Winscombe was part of the Axbridge Rural District. When this was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 it became part of the Woodspring district in the new county of Avon. In 1996 this became the North Somerset unitary authority, which remains part of the ceremonial county of Somerset.\n\nThe MP for the Weston-super-Mare parliamentary constituency is John Penrose of the Conservative Party, who first won the seat in the 2005 General Election and has retained it subsequently.\n\nSlader's Leigh is a local nature reserve. It is a wildflower meadow with plants including devil’s-bit scabious, cowslip, betony, common spotted orchid and tormentil which provide a habitat for a range of butterflies.\n\nWinscombe grew in the 19th century with the arrival of a branch of the Great Western Railway, opened in 1869. This was the Cheddar Valley line, also known as the Strawberry Line, which ran from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. The railway was closed in 1963, and today the route is a public footpath and cycle track; the site of the former Winscombe railway station is now the Millennium Green. It is possible to walk, or cycle, from the railway station to the coast at Clevedon via Sandford, Congresbury and Yatton, and in the opposite direction through the railway tunnel at Shute Shelve Hill to Axbridge and Cheddar.\n\nThe railway station was originally named Woodborough, that being the part of the parish of Winscombe where it was; Winscombe was originally the settlement up by the church. The railway station was soon renamed Winscombe to avoid confusion with another railway station in Wiltshire named Woodborough. The railway station was closed in 1963 as part of the Beeching cuts to rail services. Part of the original track can still be seen from a platform by the Millennium Green.\n\nThe village is on the A371 and A38 roads.\n\nThere are two schools in the village, as well as community and sports facilities. State secondary education is provided at nearby Churchill Community School. Sidcot is a nearby fee-paying independent school run by the Society of Friends.\n\nMuch of the village was built on land originally belonging to the Quakers, and so there is only one pub in the centre of the village, called the Woodborough Inn.\n\nThere is also the local Headquarters of the Royal British Legion located near to the centre of the village in Sandford Road, opposite the village bowls club. It houses the Winscombe Club.\n\nThe Wine Shop of Winscombe, located next to the library offers regular monthly wine tasting events, in addition to hosting the annual Somerset Wine Fair.\n\nThere is a very well-established recreational ground a short distance from the centre of Winscombe, which accommodates a variety of different sports, including cricket, tennis, hockey, bowls, football (Winscombe AFC) and a rugby union team (Winscombe RFC).\n\nThe rugby club hosts three annual tournaments for mini and junior players: a mini rugby tournament for local schools; a regional championship for under 8s; and the Mendip Sevens rugby sevens tournament for ages under 13s–under 16s.\n\nThe Church of St James has origins from the 12th century. The church is in the middle of the original hamlet of Winscombe. The church has 13th-century origins but the present building dates mainly from the 15th century, with restoration and a new chancel in 1863. It is designated as a Grade I listed building. The bells of St James have long called people to worship, the original bells being cast in 1773 by local founders the Bilbie family. Two newer bells were added in 1903 by Taylors Founders. The eight bells are in the key of E flat and the tenor weighs 18-1-8 – 18 hundredweight, 1 quarter of a hundredweight and 8 lb (930 kg). St James holds regular services on Sundays, with bell ringing being provided for both the morning service and evensong.\n\nThe former railway station site now hosts an annual May fair, on the Saturday closest to May Day, and has a variety of activities, entertainments and stalls selling various products and promoting many local charities and organisations.\n\nIn September, the village hosts the annual Michaelmas fair in the community centre, a chance for villagers to show their handiwork, handicraft and produce.\n\nThe former British headquarters of Moose International forming Moose International in Great Britain could be found at Kildare house in the village.\n\n\n"}

For example, when a skater executes a forward outside 3 turn, the skater begins on a forward outside edge and finishes on a backwards inside edge. There are eight 3 turns in all: one for each possible combination of direction (forward or backward), skating foot (left or right), and edge (inside or outside).\n\nThe turn is named for the tracing that it makes on the ice. Each edge makes a curve, and the change of edge in between them is marked by a point. It looks roughly like the number three.\n\n3 turns are considered basic turns in figure skating. Along with mohawk turns, they are the first one-foot turns (where only one foot is on the ice during the entry, exit and turn) learned by beginning skaters, and the most common way for skaters to change direction. 3 turns can also be used as the common entrance to a toe loop jump and the flip jump.\n"}

The term is often expanded to \"also\" include, particularly in international waters, any nation with vessels flying their flag that engage in exploitation (e.g. hunting, fishing, capturing) of that species. Countries in which a species occurs only as a vagrant or ‘accidental’ visitor outside of its normal range or migration route are not usually considered range states. \n\nBecause governmental conservation policy is often formulated on a national scale, and because in most countries, both governmental and private conservation organisations are also organised at the national level, the range state concept is often used by international conservation organizations in formulating their conservation and campaigning policy. \n\nAn example of one such organization is the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS, or the “Bonn Convention”). It is a multilateral treaty focusing on the conservation of critically endangered and threatened migratory species, their habitats and their migration routes. Because such habitats and/or migration routes may span national boundaries, conservation efforts are less likely to succeed without the cooperation, participation, and coordination of each of the range states. \n\n \n"}

It is applied as a topical cream, ointment, lotion or gel (Diprolene) to treat itching and other minor skin conditions such as eczema.\n\nBrand names include Alphatrex, Beta-Val, Diprolene, Diprolene AF, Diprosone, Eleuphrat and Luxiq.\n\nMinor side effects include dry skin and mild, temporary stinging when applied.\n\nBetamethasone dipropionate is a \"super high potency\" corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory skin conditions such as dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis. It is a synthetic analog of the adrenal corticosteroids. Although its exact mechanism of action is not known, it is effective when applied topically to cortico-responsive inflammatory dermatoses.\n\nAlthough the absorption of betamethasone dipropionate is small, when used for prolonged periods of time (periods exceeding two weeks), or across a large surface area (total use greater than 50 grams per week), it can have adverse effects. One such effect is the ability of the corticosteroid to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. This can lead to a depression in the release of adrenal hormones such as cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH. Symptoms of HPA axis suppression are often subtle and variable, but can often be detected using simple blood or urine tests such at ACTH stimulation test or urinary free cortisol. Those at increased risk for HPA axis suppression are those who are more likely to absorb more of the steroid through the skin. These groups include: \n\nHPA axis suppression is preventable by supplementation with glucocorticosteroids. If HPA axis suppression occurs, it is often reversed shortly after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nAbsorption of topical corticosteroids depends on several factors such as the vehicle, or delivery system used by the drug, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and whether or not an occlusive bandage is used in combination with the drug.\n\nThe absorption of topical betamethasone dipropionate is theoretically minuscule; however, if absorbed it follows the same pharmacokinetic profile that is typical of systemic corticosteroids. It is metabolized primarily by the liver by hydrolysis to its metabolites B17P (primary) and betamethasone and the 6β-hydroxy derivatives of those metabolites, and it is excreted primarily by the kidneys.\n\nBetamethasone dipropionate is a white to almost white crystalline powder.\n\nBetamethasone dipropionate was patented by Merck in 1987, as an augmented cream/lotion, Diprolene in the U.S., and Disprosone in Europe. These patents expired in 2003 and 2007 respectively leading to generic production of betamethasone dipropionate. During this time other topical corticosteroids such as triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate also became available as generic creams. Merck filed for \"pediatric exclusivity\" in 2001 launching a clinical trial to prove betamethasone dipropionate's safety and efficacy for use in pediatrics.\n\nBetamethasone has also been used in the formulation of combination products such as Luxiq, Lotrisone and Taclonex.\n\n"}

{"id": "2248699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248699", "title": "Sulfoxide", "text": "Sulfoxide\n\nA sulfoxide is a chemical compound containing a sulfinyl (SO) functional group attached to two carbon atoms. It is a polar functional group. Sulfoxides are the oxidized derivatives of sulfides. Examples of important sulfoxides are alliin, a precursor to the compound that gives freshly crushed garlic its aroma, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a common solvent.\n\nSulfoxides feature relatively short S–O distances. In DMSO, the S–O distance is 1.531 Å. The sulfur center is pyramidal; the sum of the angles at sulfur is about 306°.\nSulfoxides are generally represented with the structural formula R−S(=O)−R', where R and R' are organic groups. The bond between the sulfur and oxygen atoms is intermediate of a dative bond and a polarized double bond. The double-bond resonance form implies 10 electrons around sulfur (10-S-3 in N-X-L notation). The double-bond character of the S−O bond may be accounted for by donation of electron density into C−S antibonding orbitals (\"no-bond\" resonance forms in valence-bond language). Nevertheless, due to its simplicity and lack of ambiguity, the IUPAC recommends use of the expanded octet double-bond structure to depict sulfoxides, rather than the dipolar structure or structures that invoke \"no-bond\" resonance contributors. The S–O interaction has an electrostatic aspect, resulting in significant dipolar character, with negative charge centered on oxygen.\n\nA lone pair of electrons resides on the sulfur atom, giving it tetrahedral electron-pair geometry and trigonal pyramidal shape (steric number 4 with one lone pair; see VSEPR theory). When the two organic residues are dissimilar, the sulfur is a chiral center, for example, in methyl phenyl sulfoxide. The energy barrier required to invert this stereocenter is sufficiently high that sulfoxides are optically stable near room temperature. That is, the rate of racemization is slow at room temperature. The enthalpy of activation for racemization is in the range 35 - 42 kcal/mol and the corresponding entropy of activation is -8 - +4 cal/mol-K. The barriers are lower for allylic and benzylic substituents.\n\nSulfoxides are typically prepared by oxidation of sulfides, using oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of thioanisole can be effected with periodate. In these oxidations, care is required to avoid over oxidation to form a sulfone. Dimethyl sulfide is oxidized to dimethyl sulfoxide and then further to dimethyl sulfone. Unsymmetrical sulfides are prochiral, thus their oxidation gives chiral sulfoxides. This process can be performed enantioselectively.\n\nDiaryl sulfoxides can be prepared by two Friedel–Crafts arylations of sulfur dioxide using an acid catalyst:\n\nBoth aryl sulfinyl chlorides and diaryl sulfoxides can be also prepared from arenes through reaction with thionyl chloride in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as BiCl, Bi(OTf), LiClO, or NaClO.\n\nSulfoxides undergo deoxygenation to give sulfides. Typically metal complexes are used to catalyze the reaction, using hydrosilanes as the stoichiometric reductant. The deoxygenation of dimethylsulfoxide is catalyzed by DMSO reductase, a molybdoenzyme:\n\nSulfoxides can be oxidized to sulfones using peroxide:\n\nThe α-CH groups of alkyl sulfoxides are susceptible to deprotonation by strong bases, such as sodium hydride:\n\nIn the Pummerer rearrangement, alkyl sulfoxides react with acetic anhydride to give migration of the oxygen from sulfur to the adjacent carbon as an acetate ester. The first step of the reaction sequence involves the sulfoxide oxygen acting as a nucleophile:\n\nSulfoxides, especially DMSO, form coordination complexes with transition metals. Depending on the hard-soft properties of the metal, the sulfoxide binds through either the sulfur or the oxygen atom. The latter is particularly common.\n\nDMSO is a widely used solvent.\n\nThe sulfoxide functional group occurs in several drugs. Notable is esomeprazole, the optically pure form of the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole. Another commercially important sulfoxides include armodafinil.\n\nMethionine sulfoxide forms from the amino acid methionine and its accumulation is associated with aging. The enzyme DMSO reductase catalyzes the interconversion of DMSO and dimethylsulfide.\n"}

The mascot is a comet and the school colors are dark green and white.\n\nJames Lick High School opened its doors in 1950 at the base of the East Foothills of San Jose; orchards and open land surrounded the established residential area. Its reach included homes in the Foothills overlooking the entire breadth of Santa Clara Valley. The land had been part of a proposed site for the city's airport in 1928. The school was named for James Lick benefactor of the Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, east. \n\nJames Lick was the first of eleven comprehensive, traditional high schools in the East Side Union High School District, and it quickly became the standard for educational quality in the emerging district. The school built a tradition of excellence in the classroom and on the athletic fields. For many years after its opening, James Lick was viewed as the \"jewel\" at the base of the foothills.\n\nThe community surrounding James Lick changed much in the subsequent decades, as orchards were replaced with apartment complexes and single family homes. As the community changed, so did the makeup of its student body. After decades as a recognized leader among comprehensive high schools, James Lick entered a period of decline. In the 1990s, a high rate of turnover developed in the school's population. During this time, standardized scores declined precipitously.\n\nIn 1999, James Lick was declared \"an underperforming school.\" Many families, concerned over academic quality and issues of school safety, removed their students by way of the \"No Child Left Behind\" legislation. The surrounding area, during the economic decline of recent years, became a haven for families seeking affordable places to live. Concurrently, many first-time homeowners found themselves in the county's epicenter of foreclosure. Even after some easing of that housing crisis, the neighborhood of James Lick High School still held Santa Clara County's top foreclosure rate - #1 out of 226 neighborhoods in 2012. The region surrounding James Lick offers few buffers from the booms and busts of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe number of students participating in James Lick High School's athletic programs has grown, along with their success on the field. James Lick offers a total of 14 distinct sports: Cross Country, American Football, Boys & Girls Volleyball, Boys & Girls Soccer, Boys & Girls Basketball, Wrestling, Softball, Baseball, Badminton, Track & Field, Swimming and Diving.\n\nIn the 2011–12 school year, 458 students participated in a sports program - 273 males and 185 females. This reflects the increased number of on-site coaches, improved sports and locker room facilities for girls, and the presence of an Athletic Director keen on improving the professionalism and performance of its athletes and coaches.\n\nIn the 2013–14 school year, Boys Soccer made team history, winning the League Title for the first time since 1967. Showing immense skill and dedication, Boys Soccer advanced into the quarter-finals of the CCS championships, defeating Greenfield High School 2–1 in overtime. Their historic run continued until the Boys finally lost to the #1 seed, Half Moon Bay High School. The Boys & Girls Basketball programs also saw success this school year - both advancing to CCS. This was the Basketball Girls' first visit to the CCS level of competition since 2008.\n\nAPI (Academic Performance Index) scores have drastically improved from 588, during the 2006–07 school year, to 674 during the 2011–12 school year. Today, consistent with James Lick's recovered vision of moving all students forward to success, its ongoing focus is on all learning communities—to meet them where they are and move them toward greater achievement.\n\nCrucial to James Lick's rise in recent years are the specific steps it has taken, developing a college-going culture –– emphasizing graduation and A-G compliance as preparation for post-high school study. A continuing effort has been made to increase both the number of AP classes and the number of students enrolled in upper division courses.\n\nAccording to the US News & Self-Report, the AP participation rate is 46%. The AP participation passing rate is 64%. The average number of exams per test taker is 3.1, according to data reported to the government and presented on U.S. News & World Report.\n\nFor the 2018–2019 school year, James Lick High School offered the following Advanced Placement Courses:\n\nStudent performance on the California High School Exit Exam has improved notably at James Lick High School. Students are prepared via support classes, after-school supports, and targeted instruction to CAHSEE standards in order to test proficient on the exam as sophomores. In 2011–12, 76% of students taking the Math portion of the CAHSEE passed, a 16% increase from the 2006–07 passing rate of 60%. Among students taking the English portion of the CAHSEE, 74% passed in 2011–12, a 14% increase from the 2006–07 passing rate of 60%.\n\nJames Lick High School's Fire Service Pathway prepares participants for entry-level positions in the fire protective industry: fire fighter, emergency medical technician, paramedic, fire inspector, fire investigator, and other fire service related careers. After successful completion of the fire service pathway and graduation, students will have the opportunity to:\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nJames Lick High School serves the working class and predominantly low-income, first and second-generation immigrant families. In 2011–12, 46% of students submitted qualifying applications for the free and reduced lunch program –– although the actual percentage of low-income families is much higher. Stigmas regarding free and reduced lunch status, as well as concerns regarding \"documentation\" reporting affect this reported percentage. Demographics are not \"destiny.\" \n\nBetween year 2006-07 and 2011–12, enrollment grew from 1055 to 1416; and student achievement leapt from 588 to 674 API points –– confirming that just as a community changes over 60 years, so can a school enhance its instructional delivery and services, honoring the demands and goals of those it serves. The James Lick staff continues to embrace this challenge.\n\nIn the 2006–07 school year, out of 1055 students, 77.10% of all students were of Hispanic descent, 8.30% White, 7.40% Asian, 4.10% Filipino, 2.10% African American, and 0.50% American Indian.\n\nIn the 2011–12 school year, out of 1416 students, 74% of all students were of Hispanic descent, 7% White, 15% Asian, 2% African American, and 1% American Indian.\n\nIn April 2018 the school proposed cutting the school's Physics science program for the 2018–2019 school year and letting students interested in taking that class look at other high schools. This would jeopardize Lick High School graduates from being accepted to University of California colleges that recommend students have three years of core science (physics, chemistry and biology). A petition to reverse the school's decision was started by members of \nthe Northern California/ Nevada Section of the American Association of Physics Teachers. \n\nThe emphasis on graduation and moving on to post-high school success has increased, along with the percentage of seniors who graduate. 2012 was the first year since 2004 when over 200 seniors graduated. The number of students meeting A-G requirements hit a new high in 2011–12 with 93 students eligible—73 of whom applied and were accepted by four-year colleges and universities.\n\nWhile the percentage of seniors graduating from James Lick High School has increased, the one- and four-year dropout rates for students must be acknowledged. Since the 2007–08 school year, ever-fewer students have dropped out. In 2009–10, the one-year dropout rate was 3.30%; the four-year rate was 16.40%. Credit recovery programs, scheduling supports, and summer programs allow students to earn additional credits during the last two years of their enrollment at James Lick.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248720", "title": "African Meeting House", "text": "African Meeting House\n\nThe African Meeting House, also known variously as First African Baptist Church, First Independent Baptist Church and the Belknap Street Church, was built in 1806 and is now the oldest black church edifice still standing in the United States. It is located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, adjacent to the African-American Abiel Smith School. It is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nBefore 1805, although black Bostonians could attend white churches, they generally faced discrimination. They were assigned seats only in the balconies and were not given voting privileges.\n\nThomas Paul, an African-American preacher from New Hampshire, led worship meetings for blacks at Faneuil Hall. Paul, with twenty of his members, officially formed the First African Baptist Church on August 8, 1805. In the same year, land was purchased for a building. The African Meeting House, as it came to be commonly called, was completed the next year. At the public dedication on December 6, 1806, the first-floor pews were reserved for all those \"benevolently disposed to the Africans,\" while the black members sat in the balcony of their new meeting house.\n\n\nIn the early 1800s, Primus Hall had established a school in his home. He sought funding from the community, including African-American sailors, to pay for expenses to run the school. Unsuccessful in attempts to establish a public school with the city of Boston in 1800, he moved his school to the African Meeting House by 1806. Hall continued fund-raising to support the African-American school until 1835.\n\nBesides inspiring Boston's African Americans to pursue justice and quality in education, the school offered them opportunities for employment and economic growth, which in turn provided funds for future generations of African-American Bostonians to pursue higher education.\n\nThe Abiel Smith School was built in 1834 following the donation of $2,000 by Abiel Smith. The primary and grammar school was the first building built as a public school for African Americans in the country. In 1835, all black children in Boston were assigned to the Smith school, which replaced the basement school in the African Meeting House.\n\nThe African Meeting House became known as the \"Black Faneuil Hall\" during the abolitionist movement. On January 6, 1832, William Lloyd Garrison founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society here. During the Civil War, Frederick Douglass and others recruited soldiers here for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Regiments.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, when the black community began to migrate to the South End and Roxbury, the building was sold to a Jewish congregation, Anshei Lubavitch. They were the new immigrants in the city and living on Beacon Hill and in the North End. It served as a synagogue until 1972, when it was acquired by the Museum of African American History and adapted as a museum.\n\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974.\n\nThe African Meeting House houses the Museum of African American History, which is a museum \"dedicated to preserving, conserving and accurately interpreting the contributions of African Americans in New England from the colonial period through the 19th century,\" according to the Museum's website. The African Meeting House is open to the public. This site is part of Boston African American National Historic Site.\n\nAdjacent to the African Meeting House, is the Education and Technology Center. The Trust for Public Land assisted in the acquisition of the building when the museum needed space to expand.\n\nFunds for the African Meeting House were raised in both the white and black communities. Cato Gardner, a native of Africa, was responsible for raising more than $1,500 toward the total $7,700 to complete the meeting house. A commemorative inscription above the front door reads: \"Cato Gardner, first Promoter of this Building 1806.\" Scipio and Sylvia Dalton also helped organize and raise money to build the church.\n\nAlthough the building committee was able to secure $2,500 for the church, the congregation and the committee were compelled to ask the Massachusetts legislation for funds to complete construction. This funding request required an accounting of persons who worked on and supplied materials to the construction project and documents that both African-American and white laborers contributed to it. This accounting lists, for example, that the white carpenter Amos Penniman worked on the African Meeting House. This research has not yet located this document, but it does substantiate that Abel Barbadoes did masonry work on the building, as Chloe Thomas, then a resident of the Home for Aged Colored Women, told George Ruffin in 1883:\n\nI heard from the lips of some of our most honored fathers, Cato Gardner, Father Primus Hall, Hamlet Earl, Scipio Dalton, Peter G. Smith, G.H. Holmes, that George Holmes made the first hod to carry bricks and mortar that was ever used in Boston. He invented it for the purpose of carrying bricks and mortar to build our meeting house with as he was a mason and calculated to do his part to the best of his ability. And Boston Smith, father of P.G. Smith, with the rest of his devoted brothers, was anxious to do all in his power. As Boston Smith was a master builder, he led the carpentry department...Abel Barbadoes, being a master mason also assisted. He was the father of Mrs. Catherine Barbadoes at 27 Myrtle Street.\n\nThe façade of the African Meeting House is an adaptation of a design for a townhouse published by Boston architect Asher Benjamin. In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings. The African Meeting House was remodeled by the congregation in the 1850s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248728", "title": "Jewel House", "text": "Jewel House\n\nThe Jewel House is a vault housing the British Crown Jewels in the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) at the Tower of London. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 and refurbished in 2012. Regalia have been kept in various parts of the Tower since the 14th century after a series of successful and attempted thefts at Westminster Abbey.\n\nA Keeper of the Crown Jewels was appointed in 1207. Over the subsequent centuries his title varied, from Keeper of the King's Jewels, Master of the Jewel House, Master and Treasurer of the King's Jewels and Plate, or Keeper of the Jewel House. He was also Treasurer of the Chamber, a division of the Royal Household of the monarch. In this position he was also called Keeper of the Court Wardrobe, Keeper of the Privy Wardrobe, or Receiver of the Chamber. In this capacity, he represented the Lord Treasurer's interests in the regalia, and the wardrobe and privy wardrobe. Because of this, the Receiver of the Chamber exercised delegated authority over the Crown Jewels, especially those kept at the Tower of London (these two positions were separated in 1485).\n\nAlthough a treasury had been located in the Tower of London from the earliest times (as in the sub-crypt of St John's Chapel in the White Tower), from 1255 there was a separate Jewel House for state crowns and regalia, though not older crowns and regalia, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. This Jewel House stood by the now-demolished Wardrobe Tower.\n\nIn 1378, the keeper gained control over at least a part of the royal jewels, and had a box in which he kept them, with two keys: one for himself and the other for the Lord Treasurer. This was the beginning of the Jewel House Department. The royal treasure was usually kept in the Tower of London, and at the Great Treasury, Westminster. Additionally, coronation regalia was, over the centuries, kept in the Chamber of the Pyx in Westminster Abbey. From the foundation of the abbey in until 1303, the Chamber of the Pyx also held the general royal treasury. Most crowns were kept in the Tower of London from the time of Henry III, as were coronation regalia from 1643, except for some items which were in the abbey during the time of James II.\n\nFollowing Richard de Podnecott's attempted robbery of the Chamber of the Pyx in 1303, some regalia were moved to the Tower of London for safekeeping. A new Jewel House was built near the White Tower in 1378, and by the 1530s the reserve of jewels and plate was brought together in the rebuilt Jewel House, on the south side of the White Tower. Regalia were kept on the upper floor and plate on the lower floor. The coronation regalia would remain at Westminster Abbey until the 17th century.\n\nThe first keeper (however styled) after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Sir Gilbert Talbot, was the last to exercise day-to-day control over the Jewel House. At that time, he was styled as Master and Treasurer of the Jewels and Plate. Spare plate was kept at the Palace of Whitehall, and later, probably, at St James's Palace. Very large quantities of spare plate were melted down and sold in 1680, and thereafter the Jewel House held comparatively little besides the items held at the Tower of London, though much of it was out on loan.\n\nFrom 1660, as the Privy Wardrobe was no longer at the Tower of London, a caretaker was appointed as watchman for the Master of the Jewel House. He later became known as the Keeper of the Regalia or Keeper of the Jewel Office at the Tower. From this appointment, a separate branch of the Jewel House Department developed. When the latter was closed down, the Tower of London Jewel House alone remained. From 1665, the regalia were on show to the public, and over time this activity of the Jewel House became increasingly important.\n\nIn 1669, the regalia were moved to a new chamber in the Martin Tower. A custodian named Talbot Edwards showed the jewels to visitors for a small fee. At first, this was a very informal arrangement, with Edwards taking the regalia out of a locked cupboard to show it. The arrangement was ended in 1671, when Colonel Thomas Blood overpowered the custodian, tied him up and, with the help of three accomplices, made off with the Crown Jewels. All the items were recovered, though some had been damaged; St Edward's Crown had been crushed with a mallet, and the Sovereign's Orb took a dent.\n\nDrastic changes followed: an armed guard was provided, the collection was put behind bars in a windowless room, and the first guidebook to the Crown Jewels was published, formally establishing it as a visitor attraction. People were locked inside the tower during their visit and only permitted to see the jewels from a distance. For a small fee, they could reach through the bars and touch some of the jewels.\n\nIn 1782, as part of a wider rationalisation of the Royal Household, the Department of the Jewel Office, under the Master of the Jewel Office, who was generally a senior politician, was abolished, and the Lord Chamberlain's Office took over the accounting functions, with an official called the Officer of the Jewels and Plate. From 1782 until 1814, there was only a resident caretaker to guard the regalia and other jewels at the Tower of London. In 1814, a Keeper of the Jewel House was appointed. He had a servant as \"Exhibitor\" (renamed Curator in 1921), responsible for the day-to-day custody of the jewels.\n\nIn 1815, a female visitor (later found insane) grabbed the State Crown and pulled it to bits, causing more than £10 worth of damage. This and the poor quality of the keeper's live-in accommodation led to an overhaul in 1816. A rail was installed to keep the public at a distance from the jewels, and the repaired State Crown and Exeter Salt were put in glass cases on revolving tables. The whole collection was lit by six powerful argand lamps.\n\nBy now, the Jewel House was a very lucrative business and, in the 1830s, the keeper earned £550 a year. When he lowered the entrance fee in 1838 in a bid to attract more visitors, his income soared to £1,500. Aghast, the Treasury, which received no money from the enterprise but paid for the upkeep of the jewels, began to make new arrangements. In 1840, they drew up plans for the construction of a new building in the Tower of London to house the collection, opened in 1842.\n\nThe Crown Jewels were displayed in glass cases in the middle of a room with large windows so that people could walk around them and see them more clearly. In 1852, the keeper was formally recognised as a member of the Royal Household and paid a fixed salary. Unfortunately, the new Jewel House building was judged to be a fire hazard, and so a new chamber was constructed on the upper floor of the Wakefield Tower in 1868 by the architect Anthony Salvin. Apart from their temporary removal during war, and for ceremonial use, the Crown Jewels remained there until 1967.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the 19th century Jewel House was inadequate both in terms of security and public access. At peak times, 1,500 visitors a day were coming to see the jewels. The 1967 Jewel House was built in the west wing of the Waterloo Barracks at a cost of £360,000 and it was designed to cater for up to 5,000 visitors a day. An underground vault extending out under the lawns in front of the barracks housed the priceless coronation regalia, while the State Trumpets, maces and plate were displayed on the ground floor. Visitors walked down 49 steps to enter the concrete vault, said to be able to protect the Crown Jewels against a nuclear attack, and the regalia were in a large star-shaped case designed by the architect Alan Irvine, around which visitors proceeded clockwise under the supervision of wardens. A raised gallery 2 metres (7 ft) from the case allowed people to view the collection at a more leisurely pace.\n\nAn assistant curator had been appointed in 1963, and a second in 1968, when a new independent body of wardens and senior wardens was created to replace the former detail of Yeomen Warders of the Tower of London who had been responsible for the outward protection of the jewels. The post of Keeper of the Jewel House was combined with that of the Resident Governor of the Tower of London in 1968, and a Deputy Governor assumed much of his responsibilities. In 1990, the Jewel House and the Tower of London became the responsibility of the new Historic Royal Palaces agency.\n\nBy the 1980s, up to 15,000 people a day were visiting the jewels, causing queues up to an hour long. The display had also begun to look old-fashioned; according to David Beeton, then CEO of Historic Royal Palaces, \"they were displayed as if they were in a jeweller's shop window\". In 1992, it was decided to bring the coronation regalia out of the underground vault and build a new Jewel House with larger capacity on the ground floor of the building at a cost of £10 million. Inspiration for the layout and presentation was taken from Disneyland, the Seville Expo and jewel houses across Europe.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II opened the new Jewel House on 24 March 1994. It occupies almost the entire ground floor of the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) and is designed to allow up to 20,000 people a day to see the collection of more than 100 priceless objects and 23,578 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires. They were lit by state-of-the-art fibre optics and rested on French velvet.\n\nHowever, critics derided the experience as \"just an exercise in crowd management, beautifully lit and presented but literally mechanistic\", a reference to the six-inch-thick, two-tonne steel doors, and the use of a travelator at peak times.\n\nIn 2012, the exhibit was given a £2.5 million revamp to include a new introduction area with a video showing the history of the Crown Jewels and explaining how they are used in the coronation ceremony. The jewels themselves are displayed in the order they are used in the ceremony, and Handel's coronation anthems can be heard as visitors tour the exhibition. Brighter lights were installed to present the jewels in a more natural way, and a new lift provides disabled access to the viewing platform. The Princess Royal officially reopened the Jewel House on 29 March 2012.\n\nThe underground vault built in 1967 is home to 25,000 architectural drawings of historic royal palaces.\n\nThe Crown Jewels are protected by bombproof glass, and visitors to the tower are closely watched by more than 100 hidden CCTV cameras. The security of the Tower of London as a whole is provided by the 22-strong Tower Guard which has been at the Waterloo Block since 1845. They are on detachment from the British Army and \"operate under orders agreed with the Ministry of Defence to ensure the security of the Crown Jewels\".\n\nThe 38 Yeomen Warders, ex-military personnel employed by Historic Royal Palaces, also provide security, though their daytime role is more concerned with managing the large number of visitors. Unlike the soldiers of the Tower Guard, who rotate, the Yeomen Warders are permanent and live in the tower itself. The present body dates from 1485, and they wear similar uniforms to the Sovereign's bodyguards, the Yeomen of the Guard, of which they have been extraordinary members since 1550.\n\nThe jewels are removed on the authority of the Lord Chamberlain, head of the Royal Household, exercised by his deputy the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. He signs a voucher on receipt of the items from the Deputy Governor. Only the Crown Jeweller can handle the regalia. It is customary for armed police officers to be present at all times. In 2011, Colonel Richard Harrold was appointed as the Keeper of the Jewel House. The Chief Exhibitor of the Jewel House is Keith Hanson, and the Deputy Chief Exhibitor is Lyn Jones.\n\n"}

He has been referred to as a Tartan Noir author. His debut novel was \"Quite Ugly One Morning\" and subsequent works have included \"One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night\", which he said \"was just the sort of book he needed to write before he turned 30\", and \"All Fun and Games until Somebody Loses an Eye\" (2005). Between April 2008 and December 2015, he was the President of Humanist Society Scotland.\n\nBrookmyre was born in Glasgow and raised and schooled in Barrhead, attending St. Mark's Primary School and St. Luke's High School, before attending the University of Glasgow. Brookmyre is married to an anaesthetist with whom he has a son, and supports St Mirren F.C., references to Scottish football ('fitba') frequently featuring in his books. Brookmyre has also been a guest on BBC Scotland's Sportscene Results programme during the football season.\n\nEight of Brookmyre's novels (\"Quite Ugly One Morning\", \"Country of the Blind\", \"Boiling a Frog\", \"Be My Enemy\", \"Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks\", \"Dead Girl Walking\", \"Black Widow\" and \"Want You Gone\") centre on the investigative journalist Jack Parlabane. Parlabane also stars in the short stories \"Bampot Central\", \"Place B.\" and \"The Last Day of Christmas\" with the latter serving as a short prelude to \"Dead Girl Walking\". Parlabane also appears in \"Fallen Angel\"\n\nThree of Brookmyre's novels feature the character of counterterrorism officer Angelique de Xavia: \"A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away\", \"The Sacred Art of Stealing\", and \"A Snowball in Hell\". \"A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away\" and \"A Snowball in Hell\" pit Xavia against international terrorist-for-hire Simon Darcourt. \"A Snowball in Hell\" was originally due to be titled \"The Great Grease-Tailed Shaven Pig Hunt\".\n\nThree of Brookmyre's novels feature the characters Jasmine Sharp, a private detective, and Catherine McLeod, a police investigator: \"Where the Bodies Are Buried\", \"When the Devil Drives\", and \"Flesh Wounds\". Catherine McLeod also features in the short story \"Siege Mentality\", and has minor roles in \"Dead Girl Walking\" and \"Black Widow\", with a minor reference in \"Fallen Angel\".\n\n\"Bedlam\" was released in 2013. The book has been turned into a video game, also written by Brookmyre.\n\nIn 2018, Brookmyre wrote \"The Way of All Flesh\" with his wife, Dr. Marisa Haetzman. It was published under the pseudonym Ambrose Parry.\n\n\nBrookmyre has said that the inspiration for Jack Parlabane was Ford Prefect from Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series; he said \"I always adored the idea of a character who cheerfully wanders into enormously dangerous situations and effortlessly makes them much worse.\" The name Parlabane is taken from the works of Robertson Davies as are the names of several other characters in Brookmyre's works, indicating another of the author's influences.\n\nMusic is heavily featured in several books. \nQuite Ugly One Morning is taken from Warren Zevon's album Mr Bad Example - the last chapter title continues the song's chorus.\nZevon and Bruce Springsteen feature in the second novel, Country of the Blind.\n\nArt Alexakis of the band Everclear has been thanked by Brookmyre inside the front cover of two of his books - \"Be My Enemy\" and \"The Sacred Art Of Stealing\". Brookmyre has said that \"Sacred Art\" was inspired by the Everclear song 'Unemployed Boyfriend' from the album \"\". This is the song which the lead character, Zal Innez, discusses with Angelique De Xavia. De Xavia is stated by her brother to spend her evenings alone \"drinking supermarket merlot and listening to that depressing Mogwai rubbish\" in \"The Sacred Art of Stealing\". The first name for Innez, as well as the inspiration for the costumes worn by his gang of bank robbers, are taken from Zal Cleminson, guitarist for The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, who always wore Pierrot makeup on stage. Parlabane is a fan of Skids and Big Country and Jasmine Sharp goes to see Twin Atlantic perform live in one of her books. \n\nThe character Jane Fleming in All Fun and Games until Somebody Loses an Eye visits King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow, witnessing a performance by Afghan Whigs frontman Greg Dulli's side-project The Twilight Singers which references lines from the Twilight Singers' song \"Teenage Wristband\". Dulli is also the rock-star on whose NME-emblazoned face Matt Black signs an autograph in One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night.\n\nIn 2003, \"Quite Ugly One Morning\" was dramatised in two parts by ITV, with the lead played by Irish actor James Nesbitt. None of Brookmyre's other novels have been adapted for television, but his short story \"Bampot Central\" was rewritten as a radio play by the author for BBC Radio 3.\n\nIn 2004, actor David Tennant narrated the audiobook of \"Quite Ugly One Morning\".\n\nIn 2007, actor Billy Boyd narrated the audiobook of \"Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks\".\n\nWith the possible exceptions of \"Pandaemonium\" and \"Bedlam\", Brookmyre's books are all set in the same \"universe\" and contain a number of recurring characters, especially the appearance or mention of major characters (such as Parlabane) in incidental roles in other stories.

Statistically its own urban area since 2006, it is often still considered part of Aalborg, sometimes the name Greater Aalborg (\"Stor-Aalborg\") is used to describe the concept.\n\nThe city is connected to Aalborg by Limfjordsbroen, which is a road bridge, and an iron railway bridge, as well as a motorway (E45) passing it to the east and running under the Limfjord.\n\nNørresundby is the site of the Lindholm Høje settlement and burial ground from the Germanic Iron Age and Viking times. There is also a museum on the site.\n\nNørresundby has many sports clubs, most notably Lindholm IF, whose highest ranking football team as of the 2013–14 season play at the fourth-highest Danish level, \"Danmarksserien\".\n\nIn 1865 a pontoon bridge by the name of Christian IX´s pontoon bridge was built. Six years later in 1871 a railroad bridge was built, which still stands today. In 1933 the pontoon bridge was removed and a new bridge, called the Limfjords bridge (Limfjordsbroen), was built in its place. Five years later on 29 May 1938 Aalborg Airport opened. \n\nThrough 1958-1960 the Limfjords bridge was expanded and in 1969 the Limfjords tunnel (Limfjordstunnelen) east of Nørresundby was opened.

He followed his coach, Darren Sunkett, to East Saint Louis High School for his senior year. He finished his career with 5,395 rushing yards and 85 rushing touchdowns as well as 1,160 passing yards and 10 passing touchdowns.\n\nHe was a track star in high school and ran the 100 meter dash in 10.3 seconds.\n\nDamien was recruited for football by the University of Missouri, but attended Coffeyville Community College in Coffeyville, Kansas before transferring to the University of Missouri.

{"id": "2248743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248743", "title": "Conservatory of Flowers", "text": "Conservatory of Flowers\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers is a greenhouse and botanical garden that houses a collection of rare and exotic plants in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California. With construction having been completed in 1879, it is the oldest building in the park. It was one of the first municipal conservatories constructed in the United States and is the oldest remaining municipal wooden conservatory in the country. For these distinctions and for its associated historical, architectural, and engineering merits, the Conservatory of Flowers is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Places. It is a California Historical Landmark and a San Francisco Designated Landmark.\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers is an elaborate Victorian greenhouse with a central dome rising nearly high and arch-shaped wings extending from it for an overall length of . The building sits atop a gentle slope overlooking Conservatory Valley. The structural members are articulated through one predominant form, a four-centered or Tudor arch.\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers consists of a wood structural skeleton with glass walls set on a raised masonry foundation. The entire structure has a shallow E-shaped plan that is oriented along an east-west axis. The central high pavilion is entered through a one-story, glassed-in vestibule with a gable roof on the south side of the pavilion. Flanking the rotunda to the east and west are one-story, symmetrical wings framed by wood arches. Each wing is L-shaped in plan, with cupolas adorning the intersection of the two segments.\n\nThe octagonal pavilion supports an arched roof that is, in turn, surmounted by a clerestory and dome. The clerestory is supported by eight free-standing, wood-clad, cast-iron columns located within the rotunda and grouped in pairs. Projecting from the pavilion roof on the east, west, and south elevations are dormer windows with peak roofs. Between major arched structural framing members are wood muntins that hold the glass lights on their sides. The lights lap one over one another like shingles and follow the curve of the arches.\n\nThe construction of each arch is aesthetically appealing in its simplicity, but also structurally clever in that it takes maximum advantage of wood as a building material while overcoming its inherent structural shortcomings. From a structural perspective, the arch design utilizes the mechanical properties of the material. Wood is strongest along the length of the grain and weakest along the end grain. The use of short arch components with shallow radii minimized the amount of weaker-end grain exposed to structural forces. The assembly of the arch with several small pieces of wood, the shapes of which are identical from arch to arch, was efficient. It allowed the fabricator to set machines with guides and templates so that cutting the multiple-arch components was a simple task. Furthermore, the design required little material, since each individual arch component has only a shallow radius. Moreover, by using relatively narrow widths of lumber, the chance of warping was minimized. Finally, there was an efficiency realized in transportation, as the small size of the arch components allowed them to be easily stored and shipped.\n\nThe structural wood arches and their method of construction, along with the decorative woodwork and unique lapped glazing, define the character of the conservatory. The major character-defining elements consist of ornamental and structural woodwork, including the method of fabrication used for the arches, the lapped glazing system, the ventilation system, and the building's siting and exterior landscaping.\n\nThe conservatory kit was bought by James Lick, an eccentric businessman, piano maker, and successful real estate investor who was a patron of the sciences. It was intended for the City of San Jose, where Lick had built a mansion surrounded by exotic plants imported from South America and around the world. Lick died in 1876 before constructing the conservatory on his estate, and it was put up for sale by his trustees. The kit was then purchased by a group of prominent San Franciscans, including Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, who offered it as a gift to the City of San Francisco for use in Golden Gate Park. The Parks Commission accepted the gift and hired Lord & Burnham, a greenhouse manufacturing company from New York, to supervise the erection of the structure. Once open, it contained a large variety of rare and tropical plants, including a giant water lily, Victoria regia, which at the time was the only known specimen in the United States.\n\nIn both Europe and America, the 19th century brought increased urbanization and industrialization. In response, city governments began providing open spaces and natural settings for public use. The profession of Landscape Architecture expanded during the later part of the 19th century, and park design became a large part of this new profession's repertoire. In addition, a significant outgrowth of the need for natural surroundings in urban contexts was an increase in the study of plant sciences during this period, both by professionals and amateurs. A building type called the glasshouse or conservatory took shape, in which the city-dweller could view masterpieces of the plant world otherwise unavailable in urban environments. Municipalities and individuals spent a great deal of time and money to construct these building types, which became known as \"theaters of nature.\"\nSimilar conservatories were constructed across Europe, starting in the early 19th century. Perhaps the best known of these is the Palm House in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. These structures were enjoyed by a broad cross-section of the public. Following European fashions, wealthy Americans began to construct conservatories in the mid-19th century on private estates.\n\nThe 19th-century glasshouse grew out of the city-dweller's desire to bring nature and the natural into urban life. These structures became popular in urban, public, and semi-public settings. As these structures gained popularity in Europe, greenhouses began to be constructed on larger scales and of stronger materials. One engineer, Joseph Paxton (1803–1865), had an enormous effect on the development of the conservatory building type. His structures called for a system of glass and metal roof construction, whereas past structures had typically been constructed of wood and glass. His choice of materials allowed designs for glasshouses of substantially larger scales. His best known example is the Crystal Palace at the world's first International Exhibition in 1851. Elsewhere in Europe, Hector Horeau designed several conservatories of glass and iron, such as the Lyons Conservatory in France of 1847. In Germany, August von Voit designed the Great Palm House in the Old Botanical Gardens in Munich in 1860.\nThe increased use of glass and iron as building materials also impacted the development of the glasshouse. The decades following the construction of the Crystal Palace saw a decline in the use of wood structural members for the construction of large European greenhouses or conservatories. Many manufacturers had found that the humid heat necessary to successfully propagate numerous plant varieties often destroyed wood structural members in short periods of time.\n\nConservatories were popular throughout California's early history. Structures of various shapes and sizes were built in Victorian California, ranging from an attached and glassed-in wing for a residence, to a great domed or compartmentalized, detached glasshouse. Examples of wealthy Californians who built conservatories in their private estates include: A.K.P. (Albion Keith Paris) Harmon, for his Oakland Lake Merritt Estate (which later became Lakeside Park); Frederick Delger; Frank M. Smith; Darius Ogden Mills (Millbrae); and Luther Burbank, for his own experiments with plant germination (Santa Rosa). This is not surprising, as agriculture was fast becoming an important part of the state's economy and horticulture an important aspect of the gentleman's education. In each of these cases, wood was substituted for metal as the framing members. This posed special challenges for the ongoing maintenance and repair of the greenhouses in the long term.\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers was constructed of wood rather than iron, as was common in the later part of the 19th century, because wood was plentiful in the west. Cast-iron greenhouses do not appear to have been widely manufactured in America until the 1880s.\n\nOther known American wood conservatories of this period included Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, New York. The Lyndhurst Conservatory, constructed in 1869 of wood by the estate's first owner George Merritt, was destroyed by fire in 1880. The estate's second owner, Jay Gould, rebuilt the conservatory in 1881, hiring the firm of Lord & Burnham to manufacture his greenhouse. The 1881 Lord & Burnham structure was composed primarily of cast iron and glass. The Gould Conservatory at Lyndhurst is credited with being the first conservatory of iron in the United States and with inspiring subsequent structures of the same material. After their success with the Gould Conservatory of 1881, Lord & Burnham and other conservatory manufacturers apparently produced few large conservatories of wood.\n\nLord & Burnham and other manufactures of conservatories found that the humid heat necessary to successfully propagate numerous plant varieties often destroyed wood structural members in short periods of time.\n\nIt is widely believed that the building was fabricated in England and shipped around Cape Horn to California. However, different sources have stated that it originated in England, France, or Ireland, but no primary records have confirmed these statements. Materials analysis suggests that the structural wooden members were constructed of indigenous California Coast Redwood.\n\nDespite its prominence as a San Francisco landmark, no primary source has been found that clearly identifies the origin of the Conservatory of Flowers. Contributing to the confusion is erroneous information, based upon misunderstanding of the building or a cursory review of historic documentation that has appeared in print. Some historic documentation infers that the building was imported. Since it was common for conservatories to be shipped far from the place of manufacture, one could be led to conclude that this was the case with the Conservatory of Flowers. However, there is no historic information to substantiate the importation of the structure.\n\nDespite a range of published information to the contrary, physical evidence suggests that the Conservatory of Flowers was constructed originally of redwood and milled on the West Coast. This hypothesis is supported by the historical data concerning California manufacturing capabilities during the 1870s. This data indicates that other buildings of equal complexity were being manufactured from redwood during this period.\n\nAs part of the architectural investigation conducted by Architectural Resources Group in 1998, wood samples were taken from various locations throughout the building, and the majority found were coastal redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\"). The samples that were not redwood came from window sash and areas of the building known to have been repaired previously with Douglas fir. In addition, through visual inspection, it was determined that there was a significant amount of redwood in the building despite the various repair campaigns that occurred throughout the years.\n\nNo primary document has been uncovered to indicate the architect of the Conservatory of Flowers. It is possible that the plans uncovered at Lick's estate were produced by Lord & Burnham, the major manufacturer of greenhouses at the time. The Conservatory of Flowers bears resemblance to many of Lord & Burnham's other contemporary structures, one of which was purchased by D.O. Mills, a trustee of James Lick, in 1872. Numerous printed articles described the conservatory as \"modeled after those in the Kew Gardens, London.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Public Library also holds a document entitled \"Information about Samuel Charles Bugbee\", written by a relative, Arthur S. Bugbee, in 1957. It indicates that the architect, Samual Charles Bugbee, whose works included the homes of Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker and the Mendocino Presbyterian Church, also included the Conservatory of Flowers. Unfortunately, there are no primary source materials that have been uncovered that confirm Bugbee's involvement in the design process.\n\nThere is direct evidence that the New York firm of Lord & Burnham was contracted by the Park commissioners to construct the Conservatory of Flowers. Although Lord & Burnham supervised construction of the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, no primary evidence has been found to suggest or confirm their involvement in the manufacture of the building.\n\nThe Conservatory of Flowers was an indirect gift of philanthropist James Lick. There is little surviving evidence that details the construction of the Conservatory of Flowers. Records indicate the construction costs were roughly $30,000.\n\nThe conservatory has 16,800 window panes. The upper dome of the conservatory weighs 14.5 tonnes.\n\nLangley's \"San Francisco Directory for the Year Commencing April 1879\" discussed the construction of the Conservatory of Flowers:\n\nThe whole building required in its construction twenty-six thousand square feet of glass weighing twenty-five tons, and two tones of putty. It is a marvel of architectural beauty, surpassing in this respect any similar construction in the United States, and is only equaled in size by the Government Conservatory of in the Horticultural Gardens at Washington.\n\nThrough its life, the Conservatory of Flowers has undergone several repair campaigns. The Palm Room, located in the center of the building, was seriously damaged in a fire in 1883. Its dome was completely reconstructed at this time. It sustained little damage following the 1906 earthquake. After a second fire damaged the structure in 1918, repairs were made as needed but were not thoroughly documented. No significant documented repairs to the building took place again until sometime after World War II, when certain portions of the wood work, including structural elements, were replaced. In 1959, wood windows at the base of the glazed walls at the building's perimeter were infilled with concrete panels that were cast to match the profiles of the original construction. In 1964-65, the clerestory of the Palm Room underwent reconstruction. The columns, lintels, and sills in this area were replaced by pressure-treated redwood. Five hundred lineal feet of the exterior cap molding, which covers the arches, was replaced at this time as well. Between 1978 and 1982, major repairs were performed on deteriorated woodwork. The areas that were repaired during this time did not overlap the 1960s' repairs to the clerestory.\n\nIn general, it appears that after 1914 most maintenance work was undertaken only when conditions presented a safety hazard, mechanical systems were in need of repair, or the building became extremely unsightly. Lack of scheduled maintenance affects the performance of building materials. Wood, in particular, requires proper maintenance of paint coatings to control the development of rot. In this building, it is important to maintain the condition of the interior, as well as exterior, coatings because of the humid indoor environment. Also necessary is the maintenance of waterproofing details, such as flashing, to prevent water from accumulating in concealed areas. It is therefore not surprising that rot developed in the building, and significant repairs to the wood elements of the building were necessary over time, given its somewhat irregular maintenance history.\n\nIn the first years after the conservatory was constructed, ongoing maintenance was necessary for both the structure and its collection. This included repairing the boilers in the furnace room, the installation of ventilators, and the installation of a cement floor. At this point, the conservatory held over 9,000 plants of various kinds.\n\nIn January 1883, the conservatory caught fire, with the main dome sustaining the heaviest damage. Evidence suggests the fire started as the result of intense heat generated by the furnace. Charles Crocker donated $10,000 toward the repair fund. The reconstructed dome included the addition of a clerestory. The original dome was saucer-shaped, while the replacement dome was more classically domical in its appearance. The other major change was the finial, which prior to the fire consisted of an eagle figure, whereas the replacement feature is a traditional turned finial of wood. This has been the only major change in the overall form of the building during its lifetime.\n\nRecords indicate ongoing maintenance included painting in 1887-1889 and repainting again in 1890. In 1894, the conservatory's surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations in preparations for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. The grooves in the floor were intended to carry off the surplus water and make a visit to the conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.\n\nThe San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 did little damage to the Conservatory of Flowers. The structure is visible in a number of photographs of refugees living in Golden Gate Park after the disaster. However, records indicate that reconstruction costs ensued to the surrounding landscape from refugees living in the park.\n\nMinor repairs were made to the Conservatory of Flowers in 1912 and 1913, including carpentry, cement setting for plant benches, and other small repairs. In 1918 a fire, commencing in the furnace room, caused damage to the conservatory's Potting Room and adjacent Dome Room. Repairs were made as needed.\n\nDuring the Depression, the Conservatory of Flowers, due to apparent lack of maintenance, was in poor condition. The Park commissioners instructed the superintendent of Parks to close the Conservatory of Flowers in 1933 and construct proper barricades to prevent possible injury to citizens. The woodwork, foundations, girders, posts, and various structural members became rotted and decayed to such an extent that certain portions of the conservatory were reported to be in danger of falling and potentially causing great injury.\n\nIn August 1946, the Conservatory of Flowers was painted and reglazed. A new electrical system, which allowed automatic control of the heating system for all of the conservatory, was installed in 1948. New piping was installed in 1949. A new water supply was installed in 1956.\n\nIn 1959, the original doors at the wing entrances were replaced with plate-glass windows and concrete panels. That same year, the lower ventilators at the building's perimeter were removed, and concrete panels, cast in the profile of the ventilators, were installed. This unfortunately seriously compromised the building's natural ventilation system. A few minor repairs were made in 1962 and 1965.\n\nA major rehabilitation project took place between 1978 and 1981. Work included the removal of all interior and exterior caps of the arches for visual inspection and probing, in order to detect pockets of wood rot. The portions of arches showing surface wood rot were treated with 'Git-Rot', a wood preservative. The caps that remained in good condition were salvaged and reinstalled.\n\nBuilding evidence suggests that the exterior surfaces of the arches were originally fitted with copper flashing. The flashing was secured onto the arches and covered by the wood caps. In most locations that were inspected, the flashing had been removed, leaving only short remnants at random locations. The flashing was rolled up and taken away during the 1982 restoration effort. The flashing was an effective method of preventing moisture from entering the joints in the arch assembly, and its removal hastened deterioration. During this restoration as well, various deteriorated wood elements were replaced with pressure-treated, glue-laminated members.\n\nDuring the winter of 1995-1996, a series of large storms exacerbated the ongoing deterioration of the wood structure. The 100 mph (161 km/h) winds blew out 30,000 fogged white glass panes in the conservatory, shattered the white glass dome, and weakened the structure. In addition, 15 percent of the plant collection was lost due to exposure to the cold, wintry air and flying glass. After covering the holes with tarp and plywood and bringing in heaters, the conservatory contemplated farming out hundreds of plants to other institutions while the building was repaired. Some specimens however were too big or too old to move. The most challenging plant was the 112-year-old Brazilian philodendron that inhabited the shattered dome. A greenhouse was built to house the philodendron and other plants during renovation and afterwards used for expansion and keeping more exotic plants.\n\nThe conservatory was placed on the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. The Fund aimed to encourage repair rather replacement of the original fabric, and provided funding from financial services company American Express. In 1998, the National Trust for Historic Preservation adopted the conservatory into its Save America's Treasures program, launched as part of First Lady Hillary Clinton's Millennium Council projects. The publicity from these efforts eventually led to a fundraising campaign to raise the $25 million needed for rehabilitation, restoration, and stabilization of the conservatory. The construction lasted from 1999 until 2003. On September 20, 2003, the restored conservatory was once again opened to the public.\n\nBetween November 1996 and January 1997, on-site surveys were conducted by a project team consisting of Tennebaum-Manheim Engineers and Architectural Resources Group. Surveyors included architects, materials conservators, architectural historians, structural engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers. The architectural and materials condition survey included a close-range visual inspection of all of the wood members in the building to determine locations of deteriorated wood, an analysis of the types of wood species occurring in the building, a study of the building's construction details, glazing, and a photographic survey. The structural survey included measuring the deflection of each of the arches and studying the probable lateral and vertical load paths to determine areas of weakness.\n\nThe deterioration of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, such as the exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building's natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from the exterior of the building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.\n\nDue to the level of deterioration and concerns relating to the building's long-term maintenance, a scheme was used to restore the wood structure. This involved disassembling the structure, repairing salvageable materials, and replacing materials deteriorated beyond repair with old-growth redwood that had fallen naturally or had been left behind by loggers. This was possible due to the original method used to fabricate the structure.\n\nThe construction sequence was as follows. First, temporary protection for those plants that could not be moved was provided. Then, the glass was carefully removed from the building, and historic glazing was salvaged. Structural wood elements of the building (arches), as well as muntins that held the glazing, were disassembled. The location of each element was recorded for reinstallation. The lead-based coatings were stripped from the wood members. Each wooden piece was then tested for its strength and determined if repair or replacement was appropriate.\n\nToday, the conservatory contains approximately 1,700 plant species. Representative plants from its collections include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2248748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248748", "title": "Shinsei Bank", "text": "Shinsei Bank\n\nShinsei Bank is the successor of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which had a government monopoly on the issuance of many long-term debt securities. Following the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1989, the bank was riddled with bad debts: the government nationalized it in 1998, and it was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. After several proposed mergers with domestic banks, LTCB was sold to an international group led by US-based Ripplewood Holdings in March 2000 for ¥121 billion, the first time in history that a Japanese bank came under foreign control. Investor Christopher Flowers also played a major role in the buyout syndicate and remains a key shareholder of the company until August 2019, when the Japanese government acquired the shares held by his fund.\n\nAs part of the deal, the Japanese government insisted that LTCB maintain existing loan accounts for at least three years. The final purchase agreement included a to the effect that Shinsei could demand within the next three years that the government purchase any claims which had fallen by twenty percent or more from book value. A similar provision was afforded Aozora Bank, the successor of LTCB's similarly beleaguered sister company Nippon Credit Bank.\n\nLTCB was relaunched as \"Shinsei Bank\" (literally \"Newborn\" or \"New Life\" Bank) in June 2000, with new management and services. Many of Shinsei's managers had previous experience working for foreign financial institutions in Japan, such as CEO Thierry Porte (formerly of Morgan Stanley) and CIO Jay Dvivedi (formerly of Citibank). Shinsei continued to use the Long-Term Credit Bank SWIFT code (LTCBJPJT).\n\nShinsei used the defect warranty provision to dispose of all the worst debts owed to the bank. Several companies which had used LTCB as their primary bank went bankrupt as a result, including Sogo (July, 2000) and the Dai-Ichi Hotel. This created a furor in Japan: politicians especially criticized Goldman Sachs, which advised on the sale of LTCB, for not warning the government of the risks inherent in the defect security provision.\n\nShinsei then raised ¥230 billion in an IPO on February 20, 2004. The purchase of Shinsei thus turned a profit of over ¥100 billion within four years. The success of the IPO intensified criticism of Shinsei, however: the government was estimated to have lost ¥4-5 trillion on the deal between lost investments and forced purchases of bad debt, and the profits from the deal even escaped Japanese taxation through the use of a foreign investment partnership. In April 2004, the bank exchanged its long-term credit banking license for a standard commercial banking license.\n\nThe Financial Services Agency issued an improvement order to Shinsei on June 29, 2007 after the revenues of the company fell dramatically below targets.\n\nOn April 25, 2009, it was announced that Shinsei Bank and Aozora Bank have entered into negotiations to integrate their operations in the summer of 2010, with an eye toward an eventual merger, however the talks collapsed in May 2010 amid disputes over capitalization and business strategy, as well as the abatement of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn 2010, the bank sold its headquarters building near Hibiya Park and its operations center in Meguro in order to avoid falling below targets again due to investment writedowns during the subprime crisis in the United States. Shinsei moved its headquarters to the Nihombashi area of Chuo City in January 2011.\n\nShinsei Bank divides its business into three components: retail banking, institutional banking and consumer/commercial finance.\n\nShinsei offers a number of unique services as part of its basic \"PowerFlex\" savings account, including:\n\n\nThe Shinsei banking system is based on the FLEXCUBE software developed by Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd. Formerly i-flex solutions.\n\nShinsei also gears many of its services toward resident foreigners in Japan, with English-language online banking and telephone support, as well as no requirement for a personal seal in order to open an account.\n\nShinsei combines its commercial and investment banking operations into an \"Institutional Banking\" division which engages in a broad range of commercial lending and equity investment. The IB division is affiliated with four subsidiary companies: Shinsei Investment Management, Shinsei Securities, Shinsei Servicer and Shinsei Trust and Banking. Shinsei also does considerable investment business in Europe through subsidiaries in London and Frankfurt.\n\nShinsei operates many of its services in this field through its subsidiaries APLUS (consumer finance), Shinki (owner of the NoLoan consumer finance company), Showa Leasing (commercial and consumer leasing), Shinsei Business Finance (unsecured lending) and Shinsei Property Finance (mortgages).\n\n\n"}

Following the \"Velvet Revolution\" and the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, it was decommissioned and sold, and was used as a prop in the making of the 1995 film \"Richard III\" in London. On completion of the film, it was bought in 1995 by Russell Gray, who lives locally, for £7,000 as a present for his son. He had previously failed to secure planning permission from Southwark Council to redevelop a vacant plot of land that he owned; and so, in an act of humorous protest, he placed the tank on the site, with its gun turret turned towards the council offices. He had previously allegedly obtained permission for the installation of a \"tank\" there, assumed by council officials to mean a septic tank.\n\nThe tank is regularly repainted, and its colour scheme changed, often by local graffiti artists.

{"id": "2248762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248762", "title": "Careless Whisper", "text": "Careless Whisper\n\n\"Careless Whisper\" is a pop ballad written by George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley of British music duo Wham!. It was released on 24 July 1984 on the Wham! album \"Make It Big\". \n\nThe song features a prominent saxophone riff, and has been covered by a number of artists since its first release. It was released as a single and became a huge commercial success around the world. It reached number one in nearly 25 countries, selling about 6 million copies worldwide—2 million of them in the United States.\n\nThe song was the third Wham! song to be written, in 1981 before the band (or band name) had been fully formed. Along with \"Wham Rap!\" and \"Club Tropicana\", it was one of the three demo tracks recorded in Ridgeley's front room, which secured them their record deal with Innervision. Unlike most of the later Wham! singles, the song was co-written by Michael and Ridgeley. \n\nRidgeley came up with the chord sequence on his Fender Telecaster he had received for his 18th birthday. They continued to work together on the song and lyrics both at Michael's house in Radlett, and Shirlie Holliman's aunt's basement flat in Peckham where Ridgeley was living at the time.\n\nMichael explained in his autobiography, \"Bare\", that much of the song's content is based on events from his childhood. Michael wrote, \"With 'Careless Whisper' I remember exactly where it first came to me, where I came up with the sax line... I remember I was handing the money over to the guy on the bus and I got this line, the sax line...\"\n\n\"When I was twelve, thirteen, I used to have to chaperone my sister, who was two years older, to an ice rink at Queensway in London,\" he detailed. \"There was a girl there with long blond hair whose name was Jane. I was a fat boy in glasses and I had a big crush on her - though I didn't stand a chance. My sister used to go and do what she wanted when we got to the skating rink and I would spend the afternoon swooning over this girl Jane.\"\n\n\"A few years later, when I was sixteen, I had my first relationship with a girl called Helen\", Michael continued.\n\nIt had just started to cool off a bit when I discovered that the blonde girl from Queensway had moved in just around the corner from my school. She had moved in right next to where I used to stand and wait for my next-door neighbour, who used to give me a lift home from school. And one day I saw her walk down the path next to me and I thought – now where did SHE come from? She didn't know it was me. It was a few years later and I looked a lot different. Then we played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me. By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing – and eventually I started seeing her. She invited me in one day when I was waiting for my lift and I was ... in heaven.\n\nMichael observed that after he stopped wearing glasses, he began getting invited to parties. \"And the girl who didn't even see me when I was twelve invited me in\", he noted.\n\nSo I went out with her for a couple of months but I didn't stop seeing Helen. I thought I was being smart – I had gone from being a total loser to being a two-timer. And I remember my sisters used to give me a hard time because they found out and they really liked the first girl. The whole idea of \"Careless Whisper\" was the first girl finding out about the second – which she never did. But I started another relationship with a girl called Alexis without finishing the one with Jane. It all got a bit complicated. Jane found out about her and got rid of me ... The whole time I thought I was being cool, being this two-timer, but there really wasn't that much emotion involved. I did feel guilty about the first girl – and I have seen her since – and the idea of the song was about her. \"Careless Whisper\" was us dancing, because we danced a lot, and the idea was – we are dancing ... but she knows ... and it's finished.\n\nThe song went through at least two rounds of production. The first was during a trip Michael made to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he went to work with producer Jerry Wexler at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. Michael was unhappy with the original version produced by Wexler, and decided to re-record and produce the song himself; the second version was the one ultimately released as a single.\n\nAfter the backing track and George's vocal had been recorded, Wexler had booked the top saxophone player from Los Angeles to fly in and do the solo. \"He arrived at eleven and should have been gone by twelve\", recalled Wham! manager Simon Napier-Bell. \"Instead, after two hours, he was still there while everyone in the studio shuddered with embarrassment. He just couldn't play the opening riff the way George wanted it, the way it had been on the demo. But that had been made two years earlier by a friend of George's who lived round the corner and played sax for fun in the pub.\"\n\nWhile the saxophonist appeared to be playing the part perfectly, Michael told him, \"No, it's still not right, you see...\" and he would lower his head to the talkback microphone and patiently hum the part to him yet again. \"It has to twitch upwards a little just there! See...? And not too much.\"\n\nNapier-Bell consulted with Wexler over Michael's dispute with the sax sound. \"Is there really something George wants that's different from what the sax player is playing?\" Napier-Bell asked.\n\n\"Definitely!\" replied Wexler.\n\nI've seen things like this before. There's some tiny nuance that the sax player is somehow not getting right. Although you and I can't hear what it is, it may be the very thing that will make the record a hit. The success of pop records is so ephemeral, so unbelievably unpredictable, we just can't take the risk of being impatient. But this sax player's not going to get it, is he!\n\nThe version Wexler produced was released later in the year, as a (4:41) B-side \"Special Version\" on 12\" in the UK and Japan.\n\nThe record label Innervision were going to put out the Wexler version of \"Careless Whisper\" after the Club Fantastic Megamix as far back as 1983. Song publisher Dick Leahy said that while he could not stop the release of the Club Fantastic Megamix, he could stop the release of this single on the basis that as a publisher they \"have the right to grant the first license of the recording of a tune of which he controls the copyright\". He was unable to do anything about the Club Fantastic Megamix because it was already released material. He said: \"We knew how big that song could be, so it was necessary to upset a few people to stop it.\"\n\nMichael later went back to London's Sarm West's Studio 2 to rework the track. According to English jazz musician Dan Forshaw, saxophonist Steve Gregory had received a call to re-record the song's distinctive solo; he was the eleventh saxophone player to record the solo, for Michael was determined to get the sound he wanted. \"Session musicians do not have much idea what they are going to be recording until they arrive, and this was the case for Steve and another saxophonist who was ahead of him in the (queue)\", Forshaw recalled.\n\nAs usual there was a lot of waiting around and the guy in front of Steve threw in the towel saying, 'it's only going to be some crappy B side anyway so I'm off'. Steve waited and then discovered that the solo wasn't that easy to play in the written key, as his old Selmer Mark VI tenor didn't have a top F♯ key. So, the engineer slowed the tape down so that Steve could record the solo a semitone lower than intended. Once the tape was put back to the normal speed, a 'unnatural' saxophone sound was created that sounded a bit like an Alto in the Paul Desmond vibe, but lacking a bit more depth and darkness to the sound. George Michael had just arrived at the studio and said 'that's the one, that's the sax solo I want'. This could be down to that whole 80s synth concept where sounds became increasingly 'manufactured', or just that George never recognized it was 'wrong'.\n\nThe officially released single was issued in August 1984, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 12. Within two weeks it was at number one, ending a nine-week run at the top for \"Two Tribes\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It stayed at number one for three weeks, going on to become the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom; outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood tracks, \"Two Tribes\" and \"Relax\", Stevie Wonder with \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\", and Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\". The song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, including the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States in February 1985 under the credit \"Wham! featuring George Michael\", Spending three weeks at the top in America, the song was later named \"Billboard\"s number-one song of 1985. The song was #1 on the smooth radio top 500 songs of all time chart – proving its iconic status. \n\nDespite the success, Michael was never fond of the song. He said in 1991 that it \"was not an integral part of my emotional development ... it disappoints me that you can write a lyric very flippantly—and not a particularly good lyric—and it can mean so much to so many people. That's disillusioning for a writer.\"\n\nThe official music video (which uses the shorter single version instead of the full album version and was directed by Duncan Gibbins, who previously directed \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\") shows the guilt felt by a man (portrayed by Michael) over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner (Lisa Stahl) is going to find out. It was filmed on location in Miami, Florida, in 1984 and features such locales as Coconut Grove and Watson Island. The final part of the video shows Michael leaning out of a balcony at the last floor of Miami's Grove Towers.\n\nA first original version of the video was edited with the Jerry Wexler 1983 version, and featured Andrew as a cameo, handing over a letter to a dark-haired George. This version had a more detailed storyline, but was then re-edited later.\n\nAccording to producer Jon Roseman, production of the video was \"A fucking disaster\". According to Michael's co-star Lisa Stahl, \"They lost footage of our kissing scene so we had to reshoot it, which I didn't complain about ... Then George decided he didn't like his hair so he flew his sister over from England to cut it and we had to reshoot more scenes.\" \n\nAs the band felt they had \"screwed up\" the video, further footage of Michael singing the song onstage was later shot at the Lyceum Theatre, London.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the Extended Mix's liner notes.\n\n!scope=\"row\"| Japan (RIAJ)\n\n\"Careless Whisper\" has been covered by many other artists.

The play premiered Off-Broadway in 1968, and was revived on Broadway for its 50th anniversary in 2018. The play revolves around a group of gay men who gather for a birthday party in New York City, and was groundbreaking for its portrayal of gay life. The play has been called \"A true theatrical game-changer, \"The Boys in the Band\" helped spark a revolution by putting gay men's lives onstage, unapologetically and without judgment, in a world that was not yet willing to fully accept them.\" It was adapted into a feature film in 1970, likewise one of the first focusing on the lives of gay men.\n\nThe play is set in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and the backgrounds of characters are revealed in the course of a birthday party.\n\n\nThe party is given by Harold's six closest friends:\n\nDuring the party, the humor takes a nasty turn, as the nine men become increasingly inebriated. The party culminates in a \"game\", where each man must call someone who he has loved and tell them about it. Michael, believing that Alan has finally \"outed\" himself when he makes his call, grabs the phone from him and discovers Alan has called his wife. The audience never learns what Alan intended to discuss with Michael in the end.\n\n\"The Boys in the Band\" was written by American playwright Mart Crowley. In 1957 Crowley had started working for a number of television production companies, before meeting Natalie Wood on the set of her film \"Splendor in the Grass\" while working as a production assistant. Wood hired him as her assistant, primarily to give him ample free time to work on his gay-themed play \"The Boys in the Band\". Wood, Crowley's close friend, inspired him to move from New York to Hollywood. According to Crowley's friend Gavin Lambert, Wood sympathized with Hollywood's gay scene, and financially supported Crowley so he would be free to write his play. Crowley worked as an assistant for Wood and her husband Robert Wagner for many years.\n\nAfter several Hollywood film productions he was helping on were canceled, his wealthy friend Diana Lynn hired him to housesit. He lived in the Hollywood Georgian Mansion where he only had to \"throw dinner parties and drink myself into oblivion.\" He began writing instead of drinking, and began working on \"The Boys in the Band.\" According to Crowley, he had a droll friend he periodically would take wry comments from, and based the character of Michael on.\n\nCrowley told Dominick Dunne about the title: \"It's that line in \"A Star is Born\" when James Mason tells a distraught Judy Garland, 'You're singing for yourself and the boys in the band.'\"\n\nAccording to Crowley, his motivation in writing the play was not activism, but anger that \"had partially to do with myself and my career, but it also had to do with the social attitude of people around me, and the laws of the day.\" He says he \"wanted the injustice of it all — to all those characters — known.\" Crowley has also stated, \"I was not an activist, then or now. I didn't know what hit me. I just wrote the truth.\"\n\nCrowley reminded himself of Michael, describing him as \"a complex person who is aware of what is politically correct but has a sort of contempt for it.\" He called Donald \"a foil for Michael\" and inspired by Crowley's friend. In the 1995 documentary \"The Celluloid Closet\", Crowley explained, \"The self-deprecating humor was born out of a low self-esteem, from a sense of what the times told you about yourself.\"\n\nWhile Crowley was pitching the script, early agents stayed away from the project, and it was championed by playwright Edward Albee and Richard Barr, who at the time was head of the Playwrights Units in New York. For the production, it proved \"nearly impossible to find\" actors willing to play gay characters. An old college friend of Crowley's, 33-year-old Laurence Luckinbill, agreed to play Hank despite warnings from his agent that it would end his career, even though the agent was herself a lesbian. It was proved hard for Crowley to find producers and theater owners who were interested.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway on April 14, 1968, at Theater Four, and closed on September 6, 1970, after 1,001 performances. Directed by Robert Moore, the cast included Kenneth Nelson as Michael, Peter White as Alan McCarthy, Leonard Frey as Harold, Cliff Gorman as Emory, Frederick Combs as Donald, Laurence Luckinbill as Hank, Keith Prentice as Larry, Robert La Tourneaux as Cowboy, and Reuben Greene as Bernard. The play was one of the first works to present a story centered on homosexuals. In 1968, although only originally scheduled to run for five performances at a small venue off Broadway, it was a fast success and was moved to a larger theater. It went on to have a run in London as well. According to \"The New York Times\", the premier's actors such as Laurence Luckinbill drilled a hole in the set so they could spy on whoever was in the house's best seats, and in the initial weeks, saw Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev, and New York mayor John Lindsay. Despite the success of the play, all the gay members of the original company stayed in the closet after the premiere. Between 1984 and 1993, five of the gay men in the original production (as well as director Robert Moore and producer Richard Barr) died in the ensuing AIDS epidemic.\n\nThe play was revived Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in 1996, running from August 6 to October 20.\n\n\"The Boys in the Band\" was presented by the Transport Group Theater Company, New York City, from February 2010 to March 14, 2010, directed by Jack Cummings III.\n\nIn 2002, Crowley wrote \"The Men from the Boys\", a sequel to the play, which takes place 30 years after the original. \"The Men from the Boys\" premiered in San Francisco in 2002, directed by Ed Decker, and was produced in Los Angeles in 2003.\n\nA revival went on stage in London in October 2016, as the first revival in two decades. It received a positive review from \"The Observer\". It starred Mark Gatiss as Harold.\n\nA Broadway production of \"The Boys in the Band\", directed by Joe Mantello, opened in previews at the Booth Theatre on April 30, 2018, officially on May 31, and ran until August 11. This production, staged for the 50th anniversary of the play's original premiere, starred Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto and Andrew Rannells, as well as Charlie Carver, Brian Hutchison, Michael Benjamin Washington, Robin de Jesús, and Tuc Watkins. Quinto portrayed Harold, whose birthday sets the premise. All of the actors who were in the 2018 production are openly gay.\n\nThis production won the 2019 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.\n\nThe play was adapted into a feature film of the same name by Cinema Center Films in 1970, directed by William Friedkin.\n\nRyan Murphy will adapt the play for Netflix with the 2018 Broadway revival cast.\n\nWhen \"The Boys in the Band\" premiered in 1968, mainstream audiences were shocked. The play was profiled in the William Goldman book \"\", an account of the 1967-68 season. In the same year, a two-disc, vinyl LP set was released, containing the full dialogue of the play voiced by the original actors. Crowley wrote the sequel \"The Men from the Boys\".\n\nIn 2002, Peter Filichia from \"Theater Mania\" contended that the play's original production helped inspire the 1969 Stonewall riots and gay rights movement.\nIn 2004, David Anthony Fox from \"Philadelphia City Paper\" praised this play, its one-liners, and its live performance in Philadelphia. He rebutted criticism that the play portrayed \"urban gay men as narcissistic, bitter, shallow\".\n\nIn 2010, Elyse Summer in her review for \"CurtainUp\" called it a \"smart gimmick\" full of dated \"self-homophobic, low self-esteem characters\". In the same year, Steve Weinstein from the \"Edge\" website called it \"Shakespearean\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2248779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248779", "title": "Constitution of Mississippi", "text": "Constitution of Mississippi\n\nThe Constitution of the State of Mississippi, also known as the Mississippi Constitution, is the governing document for the U.S. state of Mississippi. It describes and enumerates the structures and functions of the Mississippian state government and lists the rights and privileges that are held by the state's residents and citizens. It was adopted on November 1, 1890.\n\nSince becoming a state, Mississippi has had four constitutions. The first one was created in 1817, upon Mississippi's ascension from a U.S. territory to that of a U.S. state. It was used until 1832, when the second constitution was created and adopted. It ended property ownership as a prerequisite for voting, which was limited to white men in the state at the time. The third constitution, adopted in 1868 and ratified the following year, was the first Mississippian constitution to be approved and ratified by the people of the state at large and bestowed state citizenship to all of the state's residents, namely newly freed slaves. The fourth constitution was adopted in November 1890 and was created by a convention consisting mostly of Democrats in order to prevent the state's African-American citizens from voting. The provisions preventing them from voting were repealed in 1975, after the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s had ruled them to have violated the tenets of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe current Mississippian state constitution has been amended and updated several times in the more than twelve decades since its original adoption in November 1890, with some sections being changed or repealed altogether. The most recent modification to have been made to the state's constitution occurred in June 2013.\n\nA few months before the start of the American Civil War in April 1861, Mississippi, a slave state located in the southern U.S., declared that it had seceded from the United States and joined the newly formed Confederacy, and it subsequently lost its representation in the U.S. Congress. Four years later, with the victory of the Union at the end of the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery via the newly enacted Thirteenth Amendment, a new Mississippian state constitution was created in 1868, to bestow citizenship and civil rights upon newly freed slaves in the state. Mississippi regained its congressional representation after it was fully readmitted back into the United States in February 1870.\n\nThe 1868 state constitution, which was the third constitution that the State of Mississippi had ever had, lasted in effect for 22 years, until 1890, when, after the Compromise of 1877 and a lengthy campaign of terrorist violence to establish Democratic rule in the state succeeded, a constitutional convention composed mainly of white Democrats created and adopted the fourth and current constitution to specifically disenfranchise, isolate, and marginalize the state's African American population. Unlike the 1868 constitution, the 1890 one did not go to the people of the state at large for their approval and ratification. The convention created, approved, and ratified it all on its own initiative, as was done in the case of the 1817 and 1832 state constitutions.\n\nThe fourth and current state constitution, created in 1890 for the expressed purpose of discriminating against freed slaves and their descendants, was utilized by the Democrats and the state government, in conjunction with terrorist violence, to marginalize and prohibit black Mississippians from participating in the state's civil society for eight decades. Unlike the 1868 constitution it replaced, the 1890 one was not sent to the people of the state at large for approval and ratification, but rather, was completely approved, adopted, and ratified by the very convention that created it in the first place. Mississippi was not the only U.S. state at the time that created a new constitution specifically for the purpose of disenfranchising their African American voters; other ones did as well, such as South Carolina in December 1895, which, under its Democratic governor, replaced its 1868 state constitution, just as Mississippi had done five years prior. As with Mississippi's current 1890 constitution, the 1895 South Carolinian constitution is still in use today.\n\nFor the next eight decades after its adoption, the 1890 constitution effectively granted the Democrat-controlled Mississippian state government free rein to prevent most African Americans from voting and casting ballots, in addition to forcing them to attend separate schools, almost always deliberately of substandard quality, forbidding them to marry people of other ethnic groups, or to bear arms for self-defense. In the 1950s and 1960s, following investigations by the United States government, these discriminatory provisions were ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court to have violated the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the tenets of the U.S. Constitution, thus rendering them legally unenforcable. However, it would take a couple more decades to formally remove them from the state's constitution, which was done when they were finally repealed in the 1970s and 1980s by the state government, nearly a century after they were enacted.\n\nThere were legislative efforts to replace the Mississippian constitution that was adopted in 1890 with a new one, notably in the 1930s and 1950s, but ultimately, such efforts were not successful. Several state governors and Mississippian politicians have opined in favor of a replacement of the 1890 constitution, on the grounds that it is morally repugnant due to its discriminatory history and contains clauses detrimental to the state's monetary commerce and businesses, enacted by Democrats to prevent private companies from out of state hiring African American workers in Mississippi, vestiges of the segregationist era. However, despite these efforts, the 1890 constitution, with its subsequent modifications and amendments, still remains in effect today.\n\nThe 1817 constitution was the first constitution Mississippi had ever had as a U.S. state, having been created when the state joined the federal Union in 1817. It was replaced in 1832 by a new state constitution, which then was used until 1868.\n\nThe 1832 state constitution was in effect until 1868, and removed the requirement that voters must own property to cast ballots. However, the right to vote and run for elected office was restricted to white men only. Women and African Americans were still prohibited from voting in the state or being elected into office under this constitution.\n\nThe 1832 constitution was the last state constitution of Mississippi that was used while slavery was still legal in the United States. It was superseded in 1868, three years after the abolition of slavery, when it was replaced by a new constitution.\n\nThe constitution changed how judges were chosen, with them being elected and no longer appointed, as defined in Article IV.\n\nDueling, which was a somewhat common occurrence in the early 19th century United States, such as the one between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr that resulted in the death of the former, was now outlawed under the 1832 state constitution. The new constitution even required politicians to deliver an affirmation that they would not engage in a duel:\n\nTerm limits were set for elected offices under the 1838 constitution.\n\nThe 1832 constitution, like the 1817 one that preceded it, prohibited the Mississippian state legislature from passing any laws designed to set free people from slavery, unless the slave had committed a \"distinguished\" deed to the benefit of the state, or had the consent of the owner, who was to be monetarily compensated for the emancipation of the slave:\n\nThis retaining of this clause from the 1817 to the 1832 constitution reflected the course of southern popular opinion at the time, in which laws that restricted state legislatures from ending slavery in their states, by making it impossible without the full consent of slave-owners, were passed or retained, or laws that made it more difficult for slave-owners to set their slaves free were also passed. As noted by future Republican U.S. president Abraham Lincoln in an 1857 speech regarding the \"Dred Scott\" decision:\n\nThis represented a shift in ideology regarding the moral nature of slavery after the Missouri Compromise of 1820, in which many people began to see slavery not as a \"great evil\" as they did in the late 18th century, but rather, in the words of 19th century South Carolinian Democrat John C. Calhoun, a \"positive good\". As a result of this shift, laws began to be passed throughout southern slave states that restricted the emancipation of slaves, something that was somewhat common during the late 18th century around the time of the American Revolution, where slave owners such as Edward Coles and Robert Carter freed their slaves using the American Enlightenment principles of the colonial revolutionaries as their inspiration. Abraham Lincoln noticed this shift in ideology, writing in an 1855 letter to a friend that:\n\nThis shift in opinion hardened southerners and Democrats' actions in the defense of the institution of slavery, ultimately culminating in the American Civil War, which would end slavery in the United States forever.\n\nThe 1868 constitution was adopted on May 15, 1868, and approved and ratified by the people of the state a year later on December 1, 1869. This was unlike the 1890 constitution that replaced it 22 years, for that constitution was completely created and approved by a convention.\n\nIn use for 22 years, the 1868 constitution was the first in the history of the state to have been approved by popular consent, when it was sent to the people at large for their ratification. It was also the first state constitution of Mississippi to have been created by both African American and white delegates. The 1868 constitution banned slavery, which had been legal under the two previous state constitutions, extended citizenship, the right of voting and bearing arms to black men, established public schools for all children in the state for the first time in its history, prohibited double jeopardy in legal proceedings, and protected the rights of property ownership for married women.\n\nDespite this, southern Democrats, supported by the northern Democratic Party, were vehemently opposed to any basic civil rights for black Mississippians, and indeed, for black southerners in general, regardless of their level of education or professional credentials. However, they acquiesced to the enactment of the 1868 constitution on the grounds that the U.S. Army's occupation of Mississippi, which prevented a violent Democratic takeover of the state, would end following a Democrat ascending to the U.S. presidency later in the year. However, this assumption proved inaccurate, as the Republican candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the U.S. presidential election of 1868 and 1872.\n\nWhen Mississippi was fully readmitted back into the United States in February 1870, it did so on the prerequisite, specified by the U.S. Congress in the 1870 \"Act to admit the State of Mississippi\", that the state not change or replace its 1868 constitution for the purpose of disenfranchising segments of its voting population, such as freed slaves. However, this agreement eventually went unheeded. In 1876, the Democrats gained the governorship of Mississippi, and 14 years later, in 1890, the 1868 constitution was replaced by a new constitution by a convention consisting overwhelmingly of white Democrats, 22 years after it was adopted. This effectively disenfranchised African American voters in the State of Mississippi for the next eight decades.\n\nThe very first article of the post-war 1868 constitution was Article 1, also known as the Bill of Rights. Borrowing many tenets from the United States Bill of Rights, it specified the rights that all residents of the state held.\n\nThe 1868 constitution's preamble stated the purpose of the constitution's creation and adoption, which was given as, the establishment and perpetuation of \"justice\", \"public order\", \"right\", \"liberty\", and \"freedom\":\n\nThis differed from the wording of the 1890 state constitution that replaced it, in which any and all references to \"justice\", \"public order\", \"liberty\", \"right\", and \"freedom\" were completely and utterly removed from the preamble by the convention's delegates. The words \"in Convention assembled\" appear after \"the people of Mississippi\", to represent the fact that the constitution was not sent to the people of the state at large for their approval and ratification, whereas the 1868 one was:\n\nThe very first section of the state constitution's Bill of Rights section determined who was a citizen of the state. The section declared that \"all persons\" who lived within the borders of the State of Mississippi were its citizens. This extended citizenship to all persons who lived in the state, regardless of their gender or color:\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy at the hands of the Union in the American Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified to outlaw slavery throughout the United States. As a result, the 1868 constitution of Mississippi was the state's first one to ban slavery throughout the state:\n\nThe current constitution of Mississippi was adopted on November 1, 1890, having replaced the 1868 constitution that had been adopted and ratified following the end of the American Civil War to bestow freedoms and civil rights upon newly freed slaves.\n\nFollowing the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Mississippian elections were wrought with deadly violence and voter intimidation as white supremacist terrorist organizations such as the \"Red Shirts\" used armed force and violent terrorism in order to prevent black voters and their white allies opposed to the Democrats, from casting ballots for the Republicans. Many Republicans, black Mississippians, and their white allies, such as Print Matthews, were lynched and murdered by armed Democratic paramilitaries as a result.\n\nAlthough slavery may have been legally ended by the Thirteenth Amendment, the ideology that the Confederates and Democrats had used to justify it did not, with it now being used by them as the rationale to deny the freed slaves and African Americans basic civil rights and freedoms. As former abolitionist Frederick Douglass noted in a December 1869 speech delivered in Boston, Massachusetts:\n\nIn the years following the American Civil War, forces of the U.S. Army were stationed in the readmitted southern U.S. states, protecting the lives and rights of African Americans and freed slaves. The Democrats were vehemently opposed to the presence of the U.S. military being there, for it prevented a violent Democratic takeover of said states. However, there were not enough army soldiers to be everywhere at all times, and as such, although they could supervise voter registration to be fair and impartial, they could not protect freedmen as they went to and from the voter registration office to register, and as such, many freedmen were lynched. With violence against freedmen increasing, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was signed into law by Republican U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant to protect them. However, that law would be short-lived, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1883.\n\nIn August 1877, former U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant, who had left office several months prior and was embarking on a tour of the world, wrote in a letter from London to U.S. Navy officer Daniel Ammen after the Compromise of 1877, about the contradictions of the Democrats in their vocal support for using overwhelming military force to quell workers' strikes, but objecting when it was used to defend the rights of African American voters from being infringed upon. He stated that the U.S. government should protect the rights of all its citizens from being infringed upon, regardless of their color:\n\nBy 1890, following years of terrorism and paramilitary violence, African Americans had \"largely disappeared from the arena of Southern politics\". The Democrats had wrested control of Mississippi state's government to rid it of the Republican Party's influences, with the state's last 19th century Republican governor, Adelbert Ames, resigning from office in 1876 due to threats of impeachment by a hostile legislature. The previous year, in November 1875, terrorists and Democrats had forcibly kept many black and Republican voters from going to the state's polls in a fraud-wrought election, using armed violence. This resulted in the Democrats gaining control of the Mississippian state legislature.\n\nWith the ascension of Rutherford B. Hayes to the U.S. presidency and the subsequent Compromise of 1877, a southern Democrat was appointed to the U.S. cabinet and the U.S. Army's forces were withdrawn from public and confined to their bases, leaving 1,155 soldiers by 1879. This effectively removed the last obstacle preventing the Democrats from violently taking over said states and disenfranchising African American voters and marked the effective end of the Republican Party in the states of the former Confederacy for nearly a century.\n\nThe state government of Mississippi, now controlled mostly by the Democrats, decided to bring to an end their campaigns of terrorist violence designed to disenfranchise the black voting population of the state, by using other methods to do so. However, rather than using solely terrorism to disenfranchise black voters and their white allies, the Democrats decided to use the law to do so, by enshrining into the state constitutions provisions that would allow them to do just that. They set their sights on replacing the 1868 constitution of Mississippi, which legally guaranteed freedoms, citizenship, enfranchisement, and other human rights to black citizens, which both northern and southern Democrats were vehemently opposed to.\n\nOriginally containing 14 articles upon its adoption on November 1, 1890, Mississippi's 1890 state constitution enlarged the powers of the state government and was longer than the 1868 one it replaced, which only had 13 articles.\n\nOn February 5, 1890, the Democrat-dominated Mississippi state legislature voted to call a convention to replace the state's 1868 constitution. On March 11, 1890, Mississippi's Democratic governor, John M. Stone, declared that July 29, 1890 was to be the date when an election was to be held to select delegates to attend the constitutional convention, which would begin in August 1890. However, as the state government was solidly controlled by the Democrats by this point, the result of the delegate election was that of the constitutional convention's 134 delegates that were elected, 133 were white, and only one was African American, despite the state having a majority African American population of 58 percent.\n\nDuring the convention, which took place in Jackson and began on August 12, 1890, running through November 1, 1890, several issues were discussed, ranging from the construction of levees in the flood-prone Mississippi Delta to the regulations of railroads. However, the most important issue, indeed, the primary cause, catalyst, and reasoning for why the convention had been called into being in the first place, were the implementation of \"literacy tests\" and \"poll taxes\" as prerequisites for voting, the intended subjective enforcement of which would disenfranchise virtually nearly every African American in the state for decades. This was something that did not exist under the 1868 constitution. Although the wording mandating the tests ostensibly implied that they were to be applied equally to all persons, the convention desired to subjectively enforce these literacy tests and poll taxes to prevent African Americans voters from casting ballots. According to the convention's delegates, some of whom were former Confederates, black suffrage was an effort to \"pull down civilization\".\n\nIndeed, according to the president of the 1890 constitutional convention, Solomon Saladin \"S.S.\" Calhoon, a Mississippian judge from Hinds County, the convention was called specifically to disenfranchise the state's African American voters, restrict their rights, and to isolate and segregate them from the rest of society. He unabashedly stated that a constitution not doing this was unacceptable to the convention's members:\n\nAnother delegate, a Bolivar County planter by the name of George P. Melchior, reiterated this view, stating:\n\nOne delegate, a lawyer from Adams County named Will T. Martin, continued this train of thought of the convention's members, stating:\n\nThe primary reasoning behind the desire of white Democrats in Mississippi, and the Democrats in other southern U.S. states, to disenfranchise their black voting populations was due to their voting overwhelmingly for Republican candidates and installing them into office, a result which Democrats referred to pejoratively as \"the menace of Negro domination\" or \"Negro supremacy\". During the time, the official policy of Democrats throughout the country was to implement patriarchal white supremacy as much as and as far as possible, using as its party slogans, \"This is a White Man's Country: Let the White Man Rule!\" and \"This is a White Man's Government!\" As one South Carolinian politician said in 1909, the Democratic Party existed for \"one plank and only one plank, namely, that this is a white man's country and the white men must govern it.\" It even referred to itself as \"The White Man's Party\".\n\nDue to Mississippi's large African American population, which comprised nearly 58 percent of the state's total population at the time, many Republican candidates would have been elected into office in most elections, were they free and fair and held without outside interference from white supremacist terrorists and Democrat-sponsored paramilitaries. The second reason for the desire of the Democrats to disfranchise and marginalize black Mississippians was due to the profound ideology of virulent bigotry and prejudice that the Democrats held towards African Americans, whom they looked upon in contempt and held in low regard. The Democrats justified their bigoted views regarding African Americans using a mixture of pseudo-scientific racism and a discredited alternative misinterpretation of the Christian Holy Bible.\n\nDuring the convention, one delegate, A.J. Paxton, suggested adding a clause into the new state constitution that African Americans be explicitly forbidden from holding office in the state at all, by adding into the constitution a clause stating that \"No negro, or person having as much as one-eighth negro blood, shall hold office in this State.\" However, since this would have been a blatant and overt violation of the United States Constitution, it was not included in the final draft. The convention decided to use more subtly-worded methods to effectively obtain that result.\n\nAnother delegate, T.V. Noland, a lawyer from Wilkinson County, suggested introducing into the constitution a clause forbidding marriages between a \"white or Caucasian\" person with a person of that of the \"Negro or Mongolian race\". He stated that they add into the constitution that \"the intermarriage of a person of the white or Caucasian race, with a person of the negro or Mongolian race, is prohibited in this State.\" A slightly modified version of this proposed clause was included into the completed constitution, with \"Mongolian race\" being replaced with that of a person having \"one-eighth or more of negro blood\".\n\nIn an 1896 ruling, the Mississippi Supreme Court, of which the 1890 convention's president later became a member, delivered a legal opinion regarding the justification and reasoning the Democrats had used for the adoption of the 1890 constitution in \"Ratliff v. Beale\", and how it came to be. The court stated that the purpose of the 1890 convention was to \"obstruct the exercise of the franchise by the negro race\". In the comments, the court admitted that the provisions of the Mississippian state constitution had violated the United States Constitution, but did not order that they be removed or modified. Instead, the court praised the 1890 constitution, saying that it was morally and legally justified and necessary due to the \"peculiarities\" that all African Americans allegedly held, which it went on to describe. The court stated that African Americans were \"criminal members\" who were prone to committing \"furitive offenses\" and thus, should not be allowed to vote in the state. The court also praised the terrorist violence that resulted in the Democrats taking control of the state, saying it justified and necessary because the Democrat members of \"the white race\" were \"superior in spirit, in governmental instinct, and in intelligence\":\n\nDue to their profound bigotry and prejudice, Mississippian Democrats viewed the concept of African Americans, whom they considered to be profoundly ignorant and immoral and incapable of improvement, voting, as being detrimental to their party's interests and the well-being of the state. In addition, the Democrats did not want to adjust their policies to better suit the interests of the state's African American constituents, nor did they desire to abandon their bigoted views and see them treated with dignity and respect on an equal footing. As a result, total and massive African American disenfranchisement was the only option that the state's Democrats saw as being preferable to their party's interests.\n\nAs J.B. Chrisman, a Mississippian judge from Lincoln County, remarked, in salutatory praise of the 1890 constitution, marginalizing and disenfranchising African Americans was seen as a kind of social badge of honor for southern Democratic men:\n\nThe State of Mississippi was not alone at the time for creating adopting entirely new constitutions specifically for the purpose of disenfranchising and marginalizing African American voters. Other southern U.S. states, such as South Carolina, under its Democratic governor Benjamin Ryan Tillman, created and adopted a new state constitution in 1895, five years after Mississippi did the same. As with Mississippi's 1890 constitution, the South Carolinian constitution of 1895 is still in effect today. Oklahoma, which was not a state until 1907 but where slavery had been practiced before the Thirteenth amendment, adopted similar laws upon statehood.\n\nThe convention that created the 1890 constitution consisted of 134 men, of which, 133 were white delegates. There was only 1 black delegate in the entire convention. This was in stark contrast with the state population of Mississippi, which consisted of nearly 58 percent African American residents.\n\nThe convention's president was Solomon Saladin \"S.S.\" Calhoon, a Mississippian judge from Hinds County who was a member of the state's supreme court. Born in January 1838, Calhoon had been a newspaper editor before the American Civil War started. When the war broke out over the expansion of slavery into western U.S. territories, Calhoon joined the Confederate army and ultimately became a lieutenant colonel. Like most former Confederates and Democrats at the time, Calhoon was a fervent believer in patriarchal white supremacy and was vehemently opposed to any basic civil rights for African Americans. In 1890, Calhoon wrote a pamphlet entitled \"Negro Suffrage\", where he outlined his opinions regarding African American voting in the state. Regarding African Americans, Calhoon stated his conviction that they had:\n\nRegarding African Americans voting in elections, Calhoon stated his firm opinion that:\n\nDuring the convention, Calhoon reiterated the views he had written in his pamphlet in an oratory delivered to the convention's members, saying that allowing African Americans to vote would lead to the \"ruin\" of the state, for they were allegedly \"unfit to rule\":\n\nDue to his prominent judicial position on the state's supreme court, any judicial challenges to the 1890 constitution that could have been brought forth to the court would have been rejected by him. Calhoon died in November 1908.\n\nThe convention consisted overwhelmingly of white Democrats, who were determined in their efforts to restrict and infringe upon the rights of black Mississippians. Marsh Cook, a white Republican from Jasper County who supported African American voting, attempted to join the convention, despite receiving death threats for attempting to do so. For supporting the right of black Mississippian citizens to vote in the state's elections, Cook was lynched and killed on a remote rural road, a common fate for many who were opposed to the Democrats at the time.\n\nThe only black member of the 1890 constitutional convention was a man from Mound Bayou named Isaiah Montgomery, whom white Democrats allowed into the convention because he was willing to support their desires of total African American voter disenfranchisement. Montgomery, who had been a former slave of Confederate president Jefferson Davis' brother, delivered a speech at the convention advocating black disenfranchisement, to the approval of the Democrats, but much to the outrage of his black peers, who labelled him a \"traitor\" and likened him to Judas Iscariot.\n\nThe 1890 convention considered the portions of its new constitution that instituted literacy tests and poll taxes as being the most important. Indeed, the implementation of these measures was the reason for the convention's very existence.\n\nThe portion of the 1890 constitution that would specifically allow the state to prevent black voters from casting ballots was Article 12's Section 244, which required that after January 1, 1892, any potential voter prove that they were literate. One method to determine their literacy was for the voter to describe, to a registrar, a \"reasonable interpretation\" of the state constitution. This was one form of the state's literacy tests, in which the constitution mandated that voters be \"literate\". Sample questions to determine \"literacy\" were made intentionally and overtly confusing and vague when applied to African Americans, such as questions inquiring as to the exact number of bubbles in a bar of soap.\n\nThe exact wording of Article 12's Section 244, from its enactment in November 1890 to its repeal in December 1975, was as follows:\n\nAlthough the wording of the 1890 constitution itself regarding voting was not explicitly discriminatory, the desired intent of the 1890 constitution's framers was that a state registrar, who would be white and politically appointed by Democrats, would deny any potential African American voter from being enrolled by rejecting their answers to a literacy test as erroneous, regardless of whether or not it actually was. The 1890 constitution also imposed a two dollar poll tax for male voters, to take effect after January 1, 1892.\n\nAfter legal challenges to these laws survived U.S. judicial review, such as in 1898's \"Williams v. Mississippi\", thanks to their race-neutral language, other southern U.S. states, such as South Carolina in 1895, and Oklahoma by 1907, emulated this method to disenfranchise their black voter base, known as \"The Mississippi Plan\", in which a law's seemingly un-discriminatory and vague wording would be applied in an arbitrary, subjective, and discriminatory manner by the authorities charged with enforcing them.\n\nDespite the 1890 constitution's seemingly un-discriminatory wording on the surface on the subject of voting, Mississippian governor James K. Vardaman, a staunch Democrat, boasted about its enabling of the state government to implement the disenfranchising of black voters. He unabashedly stated that the 1890 constitution's framers had created the constitution precisely to disenfranchise black voters, having desired to prevent black voters from casting ballots, not for any shortcomings they may or may not have had as voters, but for simply being black:\n\n\"The Clarion-Ledger\" newspaper in Jackson reiterated the views of Governor Vardaman and the 1890 convention, stating that:\n\nIn a veiled threat, Governor Vardaman stated that were the 1890 constitution fail in its explicit intent to disenfranchise the state's African American voters, the state would utilize other methods to disenfranchise them:\n\nGovernor Vardaman, like most southern Democrats at the time, was an outspoken proponent of using lynchings and terrorism as methods to marginalize and deter African American voters:\n\n\"The Clarion-Ledger\" newspaper, known for its vocal partisan support of the state's Democrats, also delivered a justification and rationale for the 1890 constitution's disenfranchising of black voters, expressing the white supremacist view that the framers of the 1890 constitution held, that even the most ignorant and uneducated white voter was preferable to the most well-educated and intelligent black voter:\n\nThe effects of the new constitution were profound. In 1890, there were 70,000 more African American voters in Mississippi than there were white ones. By 1892, that number had dropped to 8,615 black voters out of 76,742 eligible voters.\n\nAfter World War I, Sidney D. Redmond, a black lawyer from Jackson and the chairman of the Mississippian Republican Party, attempted to investigate the disenfranchising of black voters in Mississippi. He wrote letters of inquiry to several Mississippian counties, which went unanswered. He then inquired via telephone, and many of the counties responded to his inquiries by telling him that they did not \"allow niggers to register\" to vote.\n\nSeveral decades later, following an investigation by the United States government into the discriminatory voting practices of southern U.S. states, the U.S. Supreme Court would declare that methods employed by state governments to disenfranchise African American voters and prevent them from casting ballots were direct violations of the precepts United States Constitution. As a result, Section 244 was rendered effectively null and void under the rulings of U.S. court decisions such as \"Harper v. Virginia\" and the section was formally repealed by the state on December 8, 1975, 85 years after it was created.\n\nIn addition to disenfranchising black voters, the 1890 constitutional convention placed into the state constitution, for the first time, the explicit ability of the state government to explicitly restrict the right of people to bear arms across the state. It did this in Article 3's Section 12, by shifting the right of bearing arms from the broad definition of \"all persons\" to the more restrictive term of \"citizen\" only, who were intended to be limited to white men only by the 1890 constitution's framers. By granting to the state government the power to enact laws restricting the carrying of concealed weapons by the state's residents, it gave the state a newly enumerated power it did not have under the state's three previous constitutions.\n\nDuring the late 19th century and well into the early 20th century, there was a growing trend among the governments of southern U.S. states, controlled by Democrats, in implementing stricter and more stringent regulations restrictions on the right of firearms ownership. This was done in order to prevent African Americans from being able to bear arms for the purpose of defending themselves against the ever-growing threat of lynchings, terrorism, and extrajudicial paramilitary violence at the hands of Democrats and white supremacists, designed to prevent black voters from electing Republicans. Mississippi was no stranger to such restrictive laws; an 1817 law even forbade an African American person from being in possession of a canine. As with the sections of the 1890 constitution that disenfranchised black voters, the laws regarding weapons ownership used ostensibly non-discriminatory wording, but were enforced by the state government in an arbitrarily and subjective discriminatory manner, as in many southern U.S. states at the time.\n\nRegarding the right to bear arms, the 1890 constitution marked a departure from the spirit of the 1868 constitution, and indeed, from the 1817 and 1832 ones as well, all of which granted the people, rather than citizens, of the state the right to bear arms for self-defense and did not explicitly grant the state government the power to regulate said ownership. The 1890 law's wording further restricted the right to bear arms to the \"citizen\" for \"his\" defense, rather than the 1868 constitution's general-neutral \"all persons\".\n\nThe differences between the 1868 and 1890 constitutions regarding the right of the state's people to bear arms are as follows:\n\nUnlike other sections of the 1890 constitution that would later be repealed or modified by the state, such as the sections regarding marriages, education, and prisons, Article 3's Section 12 has remained unchanged, with the wording being exactly the same as it was in 1890, as Article 15's Section 273 prohibit the modification or repeal any of the sections contained in Article 3. To do so, an entirely new constitution would have to be created and adopted by the state.\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, laws in southern slave states, and even in some in northern free states, prohibited marriages between African Americans and those who were not, to assist in the solidification of the institution of slavery by discouraging contact between the two groups. However, after the Union defeated the Confederacy in 1865 and abolished slavery in the U.S., these laws were removed in the former Confederate slave states when they adopted new constitutions, which Mississippi did in 1868. However, Democrats, who objected fervently to any marriages between African Americans and those who were not, reinstated these laws when they violently took control of the states from Republicans in the 1880s and 1890s, instituting Jim Crow and segregation shortly thereafter. These laws then lasted for decades, being declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967, though they remained codified in law until they were formally removed in the late 20th century.\n\nUnlike the outgoing 1868 constitution, which contained no such restriction or prohibition, the 1890 constitution criminalized, across the state, the marriage of a \"white person\" to a \"negro\", \"mulatto\", or any person who had \"one-eighth or more of negro blood\" and mandated that the state refuse to recognize such marriages:\n\nIn 1967, after nearly 77 years of the law being in effect, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in \"Loving v. Virginia\" that laws such as the Mississippian state constitution's Section 263 violated the United States Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, the law became legally unenforceable after 1967. However, it took until December 4, 1987, 20 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, for the section to be formally repealed from the state's constitution. Other U.S. states with similar laws, such as South Carolina and Alabama, took until 1998 and 2000 to formally repeal them from their state constitutions, which was done in popular referendums that passed with slim majorities.\n\nUnlike the 1868 constitution, which did not grant the state the power to do so, the 1890 constitution explicitly granted to the state government, in Section 225, the power to separate \"white\" and \"black\" convicts \"as far as practicable\":\n\nThe wording granting the state the power to implement the \"separation of the white and black convicts as far as practicable\" would later be repealed, although the section prescribing the \"constant separation of the sexes\" is still in effect.\n\nUnlike the 1868 constitution, which contained no such requirement, the 1890 constitution introduced for the first time and mandated, in Section 207, that \"children of the white and colored races\" attend separate schools. Unlike Section 225, which merely granted the state the ability to segregate \"white and black convicts\", Section 207, created on October 7, 1890, specifically mandated that schools be segregated between \"the white and colored races\":\n\nThe result of the establishment of separate schools for students of \"the white and colored races\", which did not exist under the 1868 constitution, was that students of the latter race were forced to attend schools that were, in almost every instance, deliberately of substandard quality when compared to the schools attended by white students:\n\nThis patriarchal white supremacist view held by the Democrats, who sought to limit educational and economic opportunities for African Americans, differed greatly from the views of that of the Republicans in the 1870s and 1880s, who believed that African Americans should be allowed to vote, own land and property, attend high-quality schools, and own firearms, believing that doing so was morally right and would improve the strength and well-being of the country:\n\nIn 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that laws such as Section 207 violated the United States Constitution, and as such, the law became legally unenforceable. However, it took until December 22, 1978 for the section to be modified to not violate the U.S. Constitution, 24 years after the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court that deemed it illegal. During this period, Mississippi's politicians considered altering the constitution to abolish public schools entirely, and, amongst some politicians, to give white and negro children funds to attend separate private schools. However, the fact that Mississippi lacked the tradition of private schools present in the Northeast and Midwest made them feel this was impractical.\n\nThe Mississippian state constitution that was adopted in 1890 is still in effect today, although many of its original tenets and sections were modified or repealed later in the 20th century, mainly in response to U.S. Supreme Court rulings such as \"Harper v. Virginia\", that declared said sections to have violated segments of the United States Constitution.\n\nIn the decades since its adoption, several Mississippian governors have advocated replacing the constitution, however, after heated debates in the legislature in the 1930s and 1950s, such attempts to replace the constitution proved unsuccessful.\n\nMississippian politician Gilbert E. Carmichael, a Republican, has opined on moral and economic grounds that Mississippi adopt a new state constitution to replace the 1890 one, stating that it was detrimental to the success of business and commerce, and represented an age of immoral bigotry and hatred.\n\nThe organization of the current Mississippi Constitution is laid out in a Preamble and 15 Articles. Each Article is subdivided into Sections. However, the Section numbering does not restart between Articles; Sections 1 and 2 are in Article 1 while Article 2 began with Section 3 (since repealed). As such, newly added Sections are given alpha characters after the number (such as Section 26A in Article 3)\n\nWe, the people of Mississippi in convention assembled, grateful to Almighty God, and involving his blessing on our work, do ordain and establish this Constitution.\n\nArticle 1 defines the separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial.\n\nArticle 2 formerly defined the state boundaries; after the 1990 repeal of section 3, the legislature holds the power to define the state boundaries.\n\nMost of the rights defined in Article 3 are identical to the rights to those that are found in the United States Bill of Rights.\n\nUnique additions to the 1890 Mississippian constitution include Section 7 (denying the state the ability to secede from the United States, carried over from the 1868 constitution), Section 12 (explicitly permitting regulation of concealed carry weapons, which was not included in the 1868 constitution) and Sections 26, 26A, and 29 (on conditions for grand jury and bail necessitated by the War on Drugs).\n\nSection 12 allows for the ownership of weapons by the state's residents, however, the state government is given the power to regulate and abridge the carrying of concealed weapons. This differs from the 1868 constitution, which did not explicitly grant the state the power to restrict that right. The section states:\n\nSection 15, carried over verbatim from the 1868 constitution, forbids slavery or involuntary servitude within the state, except when done as a punishment for a crime:\nSection 18 discusses freedom of religion. It prohibits religious tests as a qualification for officeholders. It also contains a unique clause which states that this right shall not be construed as to exclude the use of the \"Holy Bible\" from any public school:\n\nSection 19 originally banned duelling:\n\nHuman life shall not be imperiled by the practice of dueling; and any citizen of this state who shall hereafter fight a duel, or assist in the same as second, or send, accept, or knowingly carry a challenge therefor, whether such an act be done in the state, or out of it, or who shall go out of the state to fight a duel, or to assist in the same as second, or to send, accept, or carry a challenge, shall be disqualified from holding any office under this Constitution, and shall be disenfranchised.\n\nThe repeal of Section 19 was proposed by Laws of 1977, and upon ratification by the electorate on November 7, 1978, was deleted from the Constitution by proclamation of the Secretary of State on December 22, 1978.\n\nSections 33–39 define the state Senate and House of Representatives while Sections 40–53 define qualifications and impeachment procedures.\n\nAn extensive portion of the article (Sections 54–77) is devoted to the rules of procedure in the legislature, particularly in regards to appropriations bills.\n\nSections 78–86 list a series of laws that the Mississippi Legislature is \"required\" to pass, while Sections 87–90 list requirements and prohibitions involving local and special laws. Sections 91–100 list additional laws which the Legislature may not pass (Section 98, which prohibited lotteries, was repealed in 1992).\n\nSection 101 defines Jackson, Mississippi as the state capital and states that it may not be moved absent voter approval.\n\nSections 102–115 contain a series of miscellaneous provisions, including a unique section (106) dealing with the State Librarian. Section 105 was repealed in 1978.\n\nSections 116–127 and 140–141 deal with the office of the Governor of Mississippi. Section 140 establishes a system of 'electoral votes' with each state House district having one electoral vote, with a candidate who receives a majority of both the popular and electoral vote being elected governor. Section 141 states that, if no candidate receives a majority of both the popular and electoral vote, then the Mississippi House of Representatives shall choose the Governor from the two candidates with the most votes. This Section came into play only one time in the state's history; in the 1999 gubernatorial election Ronnie Musgrove had the most votes, but not the majority needed to win the election outright; the House selected Musgrove.\n\nSections 128–132 deal with the office of the Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, while Section 133 deals with the Secretary of State, Section 134 with the State Treasurer and Auditor of Public Accounts. Section 143 states that all state officers shall be elected at the same time and in the same manner as the Governor.\n\nSections 135–139 deal with county and municipal officers (Section 137 was repealed in 1990).\n\nSection 142 states that, if the House of Representatives chooses the Governor under the provisions of Section 141, then no member of the House is eligible for state appointment.\n\nSection 144 states that the judicial power of the State is vested in the Mississippi Supreme Court and in such other courts as provided for in the Constitution.\n\nSections 145–150 (and Section 151 until its repeal in 1914) discuss the number, qualifications, and terms of the Supreme Court's judges (as they are called). Each judge serves an elected eight-year term (Section 149). In an odd series of provisions, Section 145 states that the number of Supreme Court judges shall be three with two forming a quorum, amended by Section 145A which states that it shall be six (\"that is to say, of three judges in addition to the three provided for by Section 145 of this Constitution\") with four forming a quorum, then further amended by Section 145B which states that it shall be nine (\"that is to say, of three judges in addition to the six provided for by Section 145-A of this Constitution\") with five forming a quorum.\n\nSections 152–164 discuss the establishment, qualifications, and terms of the circuit and chancery court judges. All such judges serve elected four-year terms (Section 153).\n\nSection 166 places a prohibition against reducing the salary of any judge during his/her term in office.\n\nSection 167 states that all civil officers are conservators of the peace.\n\nSection 168 discusses the role of the court clerks.\n\nSection 169 discusses how all processes are to be styled, that prosecutions are to be carried on in the name and by the authority of the \"State of Mississippi\", and requires that any indictment be concluded with the phrase \"against the peace and dignity of the state.\"\n\nSection 170 states that each county shall be divided into five districts, with a \"resident freeholder\" of each district to be elected, and the five to constitute the \"Board of Supervisors\" for the county. Section 176 further enforces the requirement that a Supervisor be a property owner in the district to which s/he is elected. (A 1990 proposed amendment to these sections was rejected.) It is not known whether the provisions are enforceable.\n\nSection 171 allows for creation of justice courts and constables in each county, with a minimum of two justice court judges in each county. All judges and constables serve elected four-year terms.\n\nSection 172 allows the Mississippi Legislature to create and abolish other inferior courts.\n\nSection 172A contains a prohibition against any court requiring the state or any political subdivision (or any official thereof) to levy or increase taxes.\n\nSection 173 discusses the election of the Mississippi Attorney General while Section 174 discusses the elections of the district attorneys for each circuit court. All such officials serve elected four-year terms.\n\nSection 175 allows for the removal of public officials for willful neglect of duty or misdemeanor, while Section 177 allows for the Governor to fill judicial vacancies in office subject to Senate approval.\n\nSection 177A creates a commission on judicial performance, which has the power to recommend removal of any judge below the Supreme Court (however, only the Supreme Court can order such removal), and also has the power to remove a Supreme Court judge upon 2/3 vote.\n\nSections 178–183 and 190–200 deal generally with corporations and related tax issues. Section 183 prohibits any county, town, city, or municipal corporation from owning stock or loaning money to corporations.\n\nSections 184–188, 193, and 195 deal with railroads (Sections 187, 196, and 197 also dealt with railroads and similar companies, but were later repealed).\n\nSection 198A, added in 1960, declares Mississippi to be a right-to-work state (though several other states have similar provisions, this is one of only five such provisions included in a state Constitution).\n\nSections 201–212 discuss the State Board of Education, the State and county school board superintendents, and generally the establishment and maintenance of free public schools, including those for disabled students. Sections 205 and 207, as well as later-added 213B, were later repealed. Section 207 required schools to be racially segregated, but was repealed on December 22, 1978, 24 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such laws to violate the U.S. Constitution. There were 85,738 persons, or just under 30% of those voting, who favored retaining the provision in the Constitution.\n\nSections 213 and 213A discuss higher education.\n\nSections 214–222 discuss the Mississippi National Guard.\n\nSections 224 and 225 allow the State to require convicts to perform labor, either in state industries or by working on public roads or levees (but not to private contractors). Section 225 also granted the state the power to separate \"white\" and \"black\" convicts, however this power was later repealed. Section 226 prohibits convicts in county jails from being hired outside the county.\n\nSection 223 was repealed in 1990.\n\nSections 227–239 generally discuss the creation of levee districts within the State. The text discuss the two levee districts which were created prior to the adoption of the current Constitution – the district for the Mississippi River and the district for the Yazoo River.\n\nSections 240–253 discuss matters related to voting.\n\nSection 214 required an elector to be a president of the state and county for at least one year prior to an election, and 6 months resident within the municipality they desired to register to be an elector. These were later determined to be unconstitutional by a US FederalCircuit Court in Graham v. Waller, as they served no compelling state interest, and a 30-day residency requirement was instituted in the same judicial order on a temporary basis. Subsequent statutes passed by the legislature kept the 30 day residency requirement.\n\nSections 241A, 243, and 244 were later repealed; all three were designed in some part to disenfranchise minority voting (241A required that a person be \"of good moral character\", 243 instituted a poll tax, and 244 instituted a literacy test).\n\nThis article consists of a single section (254) which states how the State will be apportioned into State Senatorial and State Representative districts after every Federal census, and that the State Senate shall consist of no more than 52 Senators and the State House shall consist of no more than 122 Representatives.\n\nSections 255 and 256 were later repealed.\n\nSections 257 through 272A contain miscellaneous other provisions not related to other Articles.\n\nSection 263, made illegal the marriage of a \"white person\" to a \"negro\" or \"mulatto\". It was ruled to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967 and was formally repealed in December 1987.\n\nSection 263A, enacted in 2004, defines marriage as between a male and female. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that such laws violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSection 265 prohibits any person who \"denies the existence of a Supreme Being\" from holding state office. This requirement, as well as similar provisions in several other state constitutions, violates the First Amendment prohibition on establishment of religion, as well as the prohibition on any kind of religious test located in Article 6 of the federal constitution.\n\nSections 269, 270, and 272 were repealed.\n\nAmendments may be made by either the Mississippi Legislature or by initiative, according to Section 273.\n\nFor Legislature-proposed amendments, 2/3 of each house must approve plus a majority of the voters.\n\nThe number of signatures required for an initiative-proposed amendment must be at least 12 percent of the total votes cast for Governor of Mississippi in the most recent gubernatorial election.

The narrative of the \"Historia Compostelana\" spans the years 1100 – 1139, the years of Gelmírez' tenure, in three books. Its twofold central agenda is to extol the Archbishop's doings, while establishing the foundation and rights of Santiago de Compostela, including its founding legend, which provided apostolic connections with Saint James the Great. The bishopric had been transferred from Iria Flavia to Compostela as recently as 1095.\n\nFrom a Galician perspective the \"Historia\" recounts the reigns of the contemporary sovereigns of Castile: Alfonso VI (until 1109), Urraca (1109–1126) and Alfonso VII (from 1126). \"A very complex work of multiple authorship, it must be used with care, for it is essentially an episcopal gesta of Diego Gelmírez, bishop and then archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, and very partisan in its commentary,\" is the assessment of the major historian of this period, Bernard F.

{"id": "2248824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248824", "title": "Picture frame", "text": "Picture frame\n\nA picture frame is a simultaneously protective and decorative edging for a picture, such as a painting or photograph. It makes displaying the work safer and easier and both sets the picture apart from its surroundings and aesthetically integrates it with them.\n\nA picture frame protects the art and presents it to good advantage.\n\nTraditionally picture frames have been made of wood, and it remains very popular because wood frames can provide strength, be shaped in a broad range of profiles, and allow a variety of surface treatments. Other materials include metals, e.g. silver, bronze, aluminum, and stiff plastics such as polystyrene. A frame surface may be of any color or texture. Both genuine gilding and imitation gold remain popular, although many other surfaces are to be found in most framing establishments. Some picture frames have elaborate molding, which may refer to the subject matter. Intricate decorations are often made of molded, then gilded plaster over a wood base. Picture frame mouldings come in a wide variety of profiles, generally in some sort of L shape with an upward \"lip\" and a horizontal rabbet. The rabbet functions as a shelf to hold the frame glazing (if any is to be used), some sort of spacer or mat/matte to keep the object safely behind the inner surface of the glazing, the object itself, and backing boards to protect the object from physical damage and environmental pollutants. The lip extends a proportionate distance up from the edge of the rabbet. It restrains materials in the frame and can be used to help set off or reveal the picture aesthetically.\n\nThe picture frame may contain a protective \"glazing\" of picture framing glass or acrylic sheet, e.g. Acrylite or Plexiglas. If the art in the frame is considered dispensable or if the exhibition environment is highly controlled, no glazing may be used. Since the 1980s significant advances have been made in the manufacture of picture glazings, creating a much broader range of options in both glass and acrylic products. Choosing which to use requires taking into account a variety of each object's characteristics: size, media used, condition of media, perceived value of object, anticipated use of the object, e.g. extended exhibition periods or travel. It is wise to consult an experienced art framer or conservator for help in making the better choice. Now, both picture framing glass and acrylic sheet are available with anti-reflective coatings to make the glazing virtually invisible under most lighting conditions. Except for pictures of only temporary interest, a glazing should incorporate a filter to block almost all ultraviolet radiation (a UV filter) from penetrating the glazing. This filter slows the photocatalytic degradation of organic materials in the picture. Both glass and acrylic glazings are available with built-in anti-static properties. This option is necessary for objects with friable or degraded media, which would be pulled off the object and onto the glazing by static electric forces. \nExcept for the most disposable or temporary displays, the glazing must be held off the surface of the picture in order to prevent the object from becoming adhered to the underside of the glazing, acquiring irreversible color changes due to compression of the media, and/or developing mold growths that otherwise would not occur. This distancing is accomplished with a mat, \"spacers\" tucked behind the glazing and hidden from view by the lip of the moulding, shadowboxing, sandwiching the glazing between two mouldings, and similar methods. Relieving the glazing is also necessary in order to prevent loose media, such as charcoal or pastel, from becoming smudged.\n\nThe treatment of the back of the framed artwork also varies widely. All frame packages should incorporate some sort of stiff, dense board to protect against physical blows and the ingress of dirt, insects, moisture, and pollutants. Except for temporary displays of expendable objects, the backboard(s) should be made from good archival-quality material, such as matboard. Archival-quality corrugated boards, both paper and plastic, are sometimes used, and foam-core boards that are described as being archival quality are also used. As with many details of good framing, the advice of an expert is valuable.\n\nBehind the backing board(s), retaining clips or brads hold the package in place, mirroring the restraint provided by the lip of the moulding at the front of the frame. A dust seal (usually sturdy archival-quality paper) is adhered, over the back of the moulding. While these are almost invariably simply functional, there are examples of works in which they have been decorated and considered part of the artwork. Finally, hanging loops or similar attachments are securely screwed to the left and right sides of the molding.\n\nPlique-à-jour picture frames, made of enamel by Bulushoff, are among the most expensive frames in the world.\n\nPicture frames are generally square or rectangular, though circular and oval frames are not uncommon. Frames in more unusual shapes such as football shapes, stars, hearts can be hand carved by a professional wood carver or carpenter (or possibly molded out of wood pulp). There are also picture frames designed to go around corners. A popular design is the scoop, an indent in the frame adding depth.\n\nThe earliest frames are thought to be those that surrounded fayum mummy portraits. The stucco frames may have been used to hang the portraits in the owner's home until the time of death, at which point the portrait would have been placed over the mummy. Another theory is that the portraits were painted close to death and were carried around the city in a funeral procession before the body was taken to the embalmer. \n\nAlthough framing borders in ancient art were used to divide scenes and ornamentation by ancient Egyptian and Greek artists in pottery and wallpaintings, the first carved wooden frames as we know them today appeared on small panel paintings in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe. According to a historical series published in \"Picture Frame Magazine\", these early \"framed panel paintings were made from one piece. The area to be painted was carved out, leaving a raised framing border around the outside edge, like a tray. The whole piece was then gessoed and gilded. Painting the image on the flat panel was the last thing to be done.\"\n\nWhen it was realized this method of producing a frame and the image within in one slab of wood was too costly, \"a more efficient method was eventually developed which used mitred moulding strips. These strips were attached to a flat wooden panel which produced a similar result to the carved panel, but were more cost effective. This type of frame is known as an engaged frame. The early ones were made of simple wooden moulding strips attached to the outside edge of a wooden panel.\"\n\nThroughout the 14th and 15th centuries, most European frames were church-commissioned and largely unmovable as they were altarpieces and a large part of the church's architecture. The frames were ornamented with architectural elements mimicking the exteriors of the great cathedrals. However, the Italian Renaissance of the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of arts patrons extending beyond the church. Wealthy nobles such as the Medici family could now bring art and frames into their estate by commissioning allegorical, devotional and portrait paintings. This was the advent of the portable or moveable frame.\n\nUnder the reign of Francis I, France's first Renaissance monarch from 1515 through 1547, art came to the forefront of daily life and flourished along with picture frames. Many workers came from Italy to the arts trade, including Leonardo da Vinci, whom \"Francis convinced to leave Italy in the last part of his life.\" Frames were now designed by furniture builders rather than the artist, sculptor or architect as in the past. Books on furniture and interior design were published and in distribution to a wider market than ever before.\n\nFrom 1610 to 1643, under the reign of Louis XIII in France, the influence of court and refinement took center stage in frame designs. The profiles became thinner than their Italian predecessors, and continuous design such as egg-and-dart, ribbon and flow of leaves, and pronounced low relief corner designs appeared. This paved the way for Baroque design in picture framing, and \"Spanish, Flemish, and Italian influences were all at work to produce a curious intermingling and exchange of ideas.\"\n\nPictures frames as art were highly developed in Orthodox countries (e.g., Russia, Serbia) and used to cover icons in churches. The earliest American frames, known as American Empire Style Frames, are very spare and utilitarian. They are similar to the simple cove or scoop in wall molding found in colonial architecture.\n\n\"L\"-style frames are a simple variety that are constructed with a single L-shaped border of wood, with the bottom part of the L, or rabbet, at the front of the frame to hold in the glass, object and backing, which are secured in from the back\n\nA photo cube is a special type of picture frame, often used to show members of a family, a vacation, or a timeline of someone's life.\n\nOther styles are clip frames (not really a frame at all), box frames and shadow boxes. A digital photo frame is an example of the changing technology of the 21st century.\n\nMacaroni picture frames are a popular craft project for children. Uncooked pasta in various shapes are glued to a frame in a pattern. Sometimes the entire frame is painted.\n\nSome contemporary painters and photographers who work on canvas \"gallery-wrap\" their artwork, i.e. extend the image around the edges of the stretched canvas, thereby precluding use of a traditional frame. In those instances, the object may be mounted so it floats visually within the protective surround. Joan Miró once made a work specifically in order to frame it with a flea market frame.\n\nAs good picture frames can be expensive, some people find previously-used frames, remove the pictures within, and reuse the frames.\n\nBlock mounting is a cheap alternative to framing. The technique (also known as display mounting, photo mounting or art mounting) involves sealing high quality photographic prints onto a wooden MDF board.\nThe process of creating one is as follows:\n\n\n"}

The Gears existed for five seasons and part of one other, from 1994 to December 19, 1999.\n\nOne of the charter franchises of the UHL (then known as the Colonial Hockey League), the club began in 1992 and originally played in Chatham, Ontario as the Chatham Wheels. In 1994, the team moved to Saginaw, Michigan and became the Saginaw Wheels, then the Saginaw LumberKings in 1996. After two poor seasons under the LumberKings monicker, new owner Khaled M. Shukairy decided to re-name the club the Saginaw Gears, after the former IHL team in Saginaw. Attendances remained flat, however, with small crowds coming to see the Gears at Wendler Arena in the Saginaw Civic Center (now known as The Dow Event Center) in downtown Saginaw. Local fans were not encouraged by the Gears poor play, with a 20-46-8 record in 1998-99.\n\nOn December 20, 1999, with the Gears again in last place at 7-17-3, the Gears abruptly left town in the middle of the night (\"a la\" the Baltimore Colts). Breaking their lease with Wendler Arena (and owing local businesses a reported $72,000), the club moved to Massillon, Ohio to finish the season as the Ohio Gears. The move had the blessing of UHL commissioner Richard Brosal after the city of Massillon announced they were to build a new 6,500-seat arena. Playing at a small community rink in Massillon (capacity: 400) with almost no one in attendance, the Gears completely collapsed on the ice, with a 5-40-5 record for the rest of the 1999-2000 campaign. The franchise went dormant after the season, planning on returning in the 2001-02 season when the new arena in Massillon was built. The arena never happened, forcing the team to remain mothballed for another year. In the end, the Gears folded without playing another game, after an unsuccessful resurrection attempt as the Arctic Xpress.\n"}

{"id": "2248844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248844", "title": "Bucket seat", "text": "Bucket seat\n\nA bucket seat is a car seat contoured to hold one person, distinct from a flat bench seat designed to fit multiple people. In its simplest form it is a rounded seat for one person with high sides, but may have curved sides that partially enclose and support the body in high-performance automobiles.\n\nBucket seats first appeared after World War II, making their debut in small European cars with floor-mounted shifter and parking brake lever. They are typically standard in front in fast cars to keep drivers and other passengers in place when turning at speed. Rear \"bucket seats\" are typically hybrids of bench and true bucket seats, being contoured generally like the latter but fixed in place, even when divided by a center console, and thus lacking a free-standing bucket seat's front-rear and backrest angle adjustability.\n\nSince their inception American cars were equipped with bench seats, which permitted three-passenger seating. As European cars became more accessible to Americans following World War II, bucket seats became associated with sports performance and luxury. Bucket seats then spread to American manufacturers, beginning as \"sporty trim packages\" in the late 1950s and later appearing as a standard feature.\n\nBy 1962, more than 1 million U.S. built cars were factory equipped with bucket seats; often, these were fitted with a center console containing a gear shifter and other features such as ash trays, cigarette lighter, storage compartment, and power window controls between the seats. Large luxurious front bucket seats (and contoured \"bucket-style\" rears) made their debut in American personal luxury cars with the debut of the 1963 Buick Riviera in late 1962 as a 1963 model. The popularity of standard bucket seats exploded with the advent of sporty compact cars (known as \"pony cars\" pioneered by the hugely popular Ford Mustang in 1964. With the introduction of subcompact automobiles in the U.S. in the early 1970s, such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, bucket seats were used due for the same reasons they had originally appeared: lack of seating room and floor-mounted levers for the gear shifter and parking brake.\n\nWhile bucket seats continued to gain popularity among compact and sporty cars, the bench seat remained the preferred front seating arrangement in larger cars and trucks until the late 1990s. Increasingly, mid- and full-size domestic cars, as well as trucks, offered front bucket seating options for customers who wanted a sporty image or more personalized car. In the following decades this trend spread, with the last sedan to come with a standard front bench seat being the 2011 Lincoln Town Car, and the last to offer it as an option the 2013 Chevrolet Impala. SUVs spread widely during this time, universally with bucket seats in front. As of 2015, only some pickup trucks and SUVs retain the front bench seat.\n\nAlthough rear seating in automobiles largely utilizes bench seats, some 2+2 cars have bucket-style seats in the rear. Long-wheelbase variants of full-size luxury cars, such as the Lexus LS 460L have an \"executive seating package\" option that reduces the rear to two passengers but provides them with more amenities. The Porsche Panamera offers only bucket seats as the rear configuration despite its large size.\n\nIndividual bucket-style seats are also used in passenger vans and minivans, although they are not always referred to as such. Unlike those in cars, bucket seats in vans can be configured in different ways or even removed for more cargo storage. In the typical minivan configuration, the front and middle rows have two bucket seats each, while the third-row seat has a three-person bench, for a total of seven passengers. Honda Odyssey 2005-2010 models (except for the base trim) adds a stowable \"PlusOneSeat\" between the middle row bucket seats. The Australian Mazda MPV has three seats in the middle and two in the last row.\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica was a luxury crossover SUV where all three rows were bucket seats.\n\nA sport seat is an improved version of a bucket seat with advanced lateral support and ability to accommodate racing harnesses. Sport seats are designed according to the shape of a human body to provide advanced lateral support and weight distribution, which helps the driver withstand g-force while cornering. Sport seats come with special openings for 3-point, 4-point, or 5-point racing harnesses to increase safety in extreme driving conditions. These seats often are lighter in weight compared to stock bucket seats, which is vital for any sport car. They are universal and technically can be installed in any vehicle using model specific or universal bolt-on seat mounting brackets.\n\nA suspension seat is a variation of a sport bucket seat designed for off-road vehicles. Unlike seats for sports cars, it is equipped with additional springs or suspension components that give extra shock absorption for bumps and jumps, making it softer and relatively more comfortable for the driver. While suspension seats provide more comfort for passengers, they are not considered safer than the static bucket seats used in motorsports.\n"}

{"id": "2248859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248859", "title": "Yoix", "text": "Yoix\n\nIn computer programming, Yoix is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. The Yoix interpreter is implemented using standard Java technology without any add-on packages and requires only a Sun-compliant JVM to operate. Initially developed by AT&T Labs researchers for internal use, it has been available as free and open source software since late 2000.\n\nIn 1998, Java technology was still emerging: the Swing toolkit was an add-on package; interruptible I/O, regular expressions, and a printf capability were not yet features; nor had Java Web Start been developed. Moreover, Java scripting languages were largely non-existent at that time: Groovy and JRuby had not yet been invented and Jython had just been created in late 1997. Browsers in 1998 had limited feature sets, were too unstable for production use in an 8-hour shift and were still fighting skirmishes in the Browser Wars. In this environment, Yoix technology was created in response to a pressing need for a reliable, easy to distribute and maintain, GUI front-end for a mission-critical application being developed within AT&T, namely its Global Fraud Management System, which to this day monitors and tracks fraud activity related to voice traffic on AT&T's expanding networks: wireline, wireless, and IP. Yoix technology was first released to the public in late 2000 under the Open Source Initiative Common Public License V1.0.\n\nThe Yoix name came about partially from the fox hunting cry of encouragement to the hounds, partially to echo another familiar four-letter name that ends in \"ix\", and partially to avoid too many false-positives in a Google search.\n\nYoix technology provides a pure Java programming language implementation of a general purpose dynamic programming language developed by researchers at AT&T Labs. Its syntax and grammar should be easy to learn for those familiar with the C programming language and Java. To an end-user, a Yoix application is indistinguishable from a Java application, but to the application developer Yoix should provide a simpler coding experience than working in Java directly, much like writing Perl code can be simpler than writing C code.\n\nThe Yoix language is not an object oriented language, but makes use of over 165 object types that provide access to most of the standard Java classes. Because the Yoix interpreter is built entirely using Java technology, it means that Yoix applications are cross-platform, GUI-capable and both network and thread friendly, yet Yoix developers find themselves insulated from the more complex and error-prone parts of coding the same functionality directly in Java. It does not use reflection to access Java functionality and thus adds value by not only simplifying access to that functionality, but also improving application reliability by coding through both Java glitches and complicated Java features one-time, behind-the-scenes. The Yoix language includes safe pointers, addressing, declarations, and global and local variables. In addition to supporting native user functions, users can add their own builtin functions written in Java.\n\nThe two central elements in the Yoix design are borrowed from the PostScript language: dictionaries as language components and permissions-protected dictionaries as exposed system components. Homage to the Tcl language and its exposure philosophy should also be given, though it did not have a direct influence.\n\nAnother key Yoix design element involves pointers and addressing. Pointers and pointer arithmetic in the Yoix language is syntactically similar to what is found in the C language, but the Yoix implementation prevents using a pointer outside its bounds. In addition, the address operator always produces a valid, usable result.\n\nOverall, the Yoix design attempted to make the language easy to learn by programmers experienced with the C and Java languages.\n\nThe Yoix distribution includes the Yoix Web Application Instant Template (YWAIT), a software framework for building a Yoix web application. A Yoix web application resides on a web server and is downloaded piecemeal at run-time on an as-needed basis by Yoix interpreters running on client machines. This model, analogous to the familiar model of client web browsers downloading a website piecemeal as-needed at run-time, permits simple, efficient distribution and maintenance of applications and relies only on the ubiquitous web server and the Yoix interpreter. Building a web application using the YWAIT framework requires just a few standard Unix tools available in most modern operating systems, such as Linux or Mac OS X, or under Microsoft Windows with the help of add-on packages such as U/Win. The client side of a YWAIT-based application relies only on the Yoix interpreter and is thus platform independent, running wherever Java runs. Because the Yoix software development philosophy aims to keep things simple by eschewing the popular tendency for multiple embedded specialized languages and the YWAIT framework permits easy, incremental screen development in a simple, logical source tree hierarchy, development of a Yoix web application is reduced to the basics: a command prompt and a text editor. IDE enthusiasts may be nonplussed, but this \"Small Is Beautiful\" approach to software development has been highly effective in practice at AT&T.\n\nIn addition to its role as a tool for building GUI applications, Yoix technology supports several modes of data visualization.\n\nA data visualization module called YDAT (Yoix Data Analysis Tool) has been included in the public Yoix distribution since release 2.1.2. YDAT uses a data manager component to coordinate data display and filtering among its several visualization components that include an event plot, a graph drawing pane, histogram filters and tabular detail. YDAT is able to display graphs generated by the GraphViz graph drawing and layout tool, which is another open source tool freely available from AT&T Labs. YDAT is highly configurable at the Yoix language level. The image below is a screenshot of a Yoix YDAT instantiation, which in this example is being used to analyze vehicle auction transactions.\n\nYoix technology provides good support for graph drawing. In addition to graph display mentioned above as part of the YDAT module, data types in the Yoix language support building, manipulating and traversing graph structures. Native Yoix functions support the DOT language output and a built-in DOT language parser to facilitate interaction with the GraphViz layout engines.\n\nThe YChart data visualization toolkit was added to the Yoix distribution with release 2.2.0. YChart allows one to organize and display cells of data. Two interactive YChart applications contained in the Yoix distribution are a Periodic Table of the Elements and a Unicode Chart. A program to demonstrate using YChart with variable width cells, as might occur with a schedule, is also available in the Yoix distribution.\n\nThe Yoix distribution also includes a Yoix package, called \"Byzgraf\", for rendering basic data plots such as line charts, histograms and statistical box plots.\n\nAs currently implemented, the Yoix language is interpreted, which means that, for example, it is probably not the right choice for computationally intensive applications unless one codes those computations in a Java module extension. Similarly, excessive looping will also display the limitations of this interpreted language. The focus of the language is interactive standalone or client/server GUI and data visualization applications.\n\nYoix technology is free software licensed under the Open Source Initiative Common Public License.

{"id": "2248864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248864", "title": "The Winning Hand", "text": "The Winning Hand\n\nThe Winning Hand is a collaborative compilation album by Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and Brenda Lee. It was released on November 1, 1982, by Monument Records. The album was produced by Fred Foster, founder and chairman of the board of Monument, and contains some newly-recorded material as well as catalog material with new instrumental tracks. The album spawned two singles, the Parton and Nelson duet \"Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way)\" and \"You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning\" by Lee and Nelson. The album also inspired a television special of the same name hosted by Johnny Cash, who had written the album's liner notes. The special featuring all four performers aired in over 150 markets in March and April 1985.\n\nThe album was announced in the September 4, 1982 issue of \"Billboard\" as the first release by Monument Records through a new distribution deal with CBS.\nThe album was released on November 1, 1982. Monument Records launched a major radio, retail and advertising campaign budgeted at $100,000 to carry the album to country, pop and adult contemporary audiences. The album's cover art depicts the four artists as kings and queens on a deck of cards. This artwork was utilized on posters, promotional decks of cards and other point-of-sale materials spotlighting the album's theme. Monument printed approximately 5,000 decks of promotional \"Winning Hand\" cards, with Nelson and Kristofferson as the kings, Lee and Parton as the queens. They were sent to pop, adult contemporary and country radio stations and a limited quantity was sent to retail locations nationally. Two weekends in November 1982 were designated as \"Winning Hand Weekends\" at key radio stations, including more than 60 country stations. The participating stations received 25 copies of the album and first single for giveaways. Additionally, Monument used the album's cover graphics to make a series of four-color 12-by-24-inch posters. Each poster was limited to 3,500 copies against red, green or blue backgrounds for in-store display. Along with the posters, retailers received promotional flats of the album with easel backs for display, and an eight track \"mini LP\" with four duet and four solo tracks from the album to be played in-store. CBS distribution also coordinated a series of retail contests to run from December 1982 to January 1983. Winners won an expense-paid trip to see any act of their choice from \"The Winning Hand\" album in concert in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe or Atlantic City.\n\nAfter writing the liner notes for the album, Johnny Cash suggested that the album be made into a television special with him as the host. Foster, Kristofferson, Nelson, Lee and Parton immediately agreed to both of Cash's suggestions, but it took a couple of years to arrange the schedules of these five superstars for the special to become a reality. The special includes every cut from the album in addition to some \"signature songs\" by each performer. Foster stated that he was humbled that the artists involved were participating in the special for a nominal fee in tribute to him. He went on to say that there wasn't enough money around or a sponsor able to pay for it otherwise. The special aired in over 150 markets in March and April 1985.\n\n\"Billboard\" published a review in the November 13, 1982 issue which said, \"From the ultra-visual packaging to the liner insert penned by Johnny Cash, this is an engaging project involving three former Monument artists and one currently signed to the reactivated label (Kristofferson). The ambitiousness of the undertaking overrides some uneven spots, which can be expected when you're pairing different superstars on nearly every track of a double-record set. Best cuts include \"You Left Me a Long, Long Time Ago\" by Nelson and Lee, \"To Make a Long Story Short, She's Gone\" by Nelson and Kristofferson, and \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\" by Parton and Kristofferson.\"\n\nThe review published in the November 13, 1982 issue of \"Cashbox\" said, \"This is the ace that Fred Foster has been saving to play once Monument finalized its distribution agreement with CBS, and the LP is worth the wait, providing an assortment of duets and solo efforts made possible by adding recently-recorded tracks to existing material from the Monument vaults. Though the combination of this fearsome foursome is in itself a strong suit, the two-record set is enhanced by inspired cover art and thoughtful liner notes by Johnny Cash.\"\n\nThe album peaked at No. 4 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Country LPs chart and No. 109 on the US \"Billboard\" Top LPs & Tape chart.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way)\", a duet by Parton and Nelson, was released in November 1982. It peaked at No. 7 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart, No. 19 on the US \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary Singles chart, and No. 102 on the US \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"You're Gonna Love Yourself in the Morning\", a duet by Lee and Nelson, was released as the album's second single in March 1983. It peaked at No. 43 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.\n\nAlbum\nSingles\n"}

U'Ren promoted and helped pass a corrupt practices act, the presidential primary, and direct election of U.S. senators. As a progressive activist, U'Ren championed the initiative, referendum, and recall systems in an effort to bring about a Georgist \"Single Tax\" on the unimproved value of land, but these measures were also designed to promote democracy and weaken the power of backstage elites. His reforms in Oregon were widely copied in other states. He supported numerous other reforms, such as the interactive model of proportional representation, which was not enacted.\n\nWilliam Simon U'Ren (accent the last syllable) was born on January 10, 1859 in Lancaster, Wisconsin, the son of immigrants from Cornwall, England. Their surname was originally spelled Uren. U'Ren's father, William Richard U'Ren was a socialist who worked as a blacksmith and emigrated to America owing to difficult economic conditions.\n\nIn America, the elder U'Ren lived as a farmer in the Midwest, working also as a blacksmith when possible. He also taught this trade to his son William. The family was both politically radical — following the journalism of Horace Greeley — but also devout albeit unconventional adherents of Christianity.\n\nAt the age of 17 the younger U'Ren left home to make his way in the world, working as a miner in the state of Colorado. U'Ren studied law and business in the evenings. He earned a law degree and was admitted to the Colorado state bar at the age of 21.\n\nU'Ren practiced law for a time in the Colorado towns of Aspen, Gunnison, and Tincup. He also became involved in Republican Party politics and edited a newspaper for a time in Tincup.\n\nA long-time sufferer of asthma, while in Colorado U'Ren contracted tuberculosis, and consequently moved to Hawaii in search of a climate that would make possible his recovery from the frequently fatal illness. It was in Honolulu that U'Ren was exposed to the economic work of Henry George, \"Progress and Poverty,\" which was greatly influential upon his thought.\n\nIn 1889, the 30-year-old U'Ren relocated to the Pacific Northwest, working for a time as a ranch hand for his parents in Eastern Oregon. U'Ren then moved to the western part of the state, settling in the town of Milwaukie, Oregon, just outside Portland, where he established a law practice. There U'Ren became involved both in reform politics and spiritualism — a major intellectual fad of the era — and became involved with the prominent Luelling family, who were actively interested in both pursuits.\n\nIn 1890, he campaigned vigorously for the Australian Ballot, which won in 1891. It was while he was involved in this campaign that he attended a séance, and met Mrs. Laure Durkee.\n\nIn 1892 U'Ren suffered a severe asthma attack and gave up his law practice. Mrs. Durkee knew that the Lewellings, a local fruit growing family, had often offered lodging and care to hard luck cases, such as U'Ren was. His health was slowly restored at the Lewellings farm. Mr. and Mrs. Seth Lewelling were reformers (with one family member writing \"good government being to us what religion is to most people\"). U'ren was already a convert to progressive causes, especially the Single Tax proposed by Henry George. Albert Lewelling gave him a copy of James W. Sullivan's book \"Direct Legislation by the Citizenship Through the Initiative and Referendum\" (1892) and U'ren decided to invest his time and effort in the cause.\n\nU'Ren brought together representatives of the state Farmer's Alliance and labor unions to form the Direct Legislation League, of which he was named secretary. He had an express goal of implementing the three legs of direct democracy – Initiative, referendum, and recall. In 1894 U'Ren was elected chairman at the Populist Party convention, and won approval of an Initiative & Referendum platform plank. In 1896 U'Ren won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives; however, in 1897 the House failed to organize, only holding a short special session in the fall of 1898. U'Ren worked the legislature during his term, without success, to gain approval for initiative and referendum. After his 1897 defeat, U'Ren reorganized the Oregon Direct Legislation League to broaden the base of initiative, referendum, and recall support. The new executive committee included bankers, the president of the state bar association, and \"The Oregonian\" editor Harvey W. Scott.\n\nU'Ren and the Direct Legislation League won passage of an initiative and referendum amendment in 1898. Under the constitution of the time, amendments had to be approved by two successive sessions of the legislature. By 1902 the legislature had approved the amendment and voters had ratified it.\n\nU'Ren associated himself with many initiative efforts, including banning free railroad passes, establishing popular election of U.S. Senators, and creating the first presidential primary in the United States. Two of the more significant early initiatives he sponsored were a 1906 constitutional amendment extending initiative and referendum powers to local jurisdictions, and a 1908 amendment that gave voters power to recall elected officials. In 1912, he proposed an amendment to the Oregon Constitution to essentially weigh each legislator's vote on proposed bills according to the number of votes he received in the last election; this measure failed by a large margin.\n\nIn 1908 U'Ren led the successful effort to amend the Oregon state constitution to accommodate proportional representation that would provide voters with first, second and third choices on the ballot. He said, \"Real representative government is impossible unless all political parties, minorities as well as majorities, are thus fairly represented in the legislature in proportion to the number of supporters that each has among the voters.\"\n\nU'Ren was a strong proponent of the single tax system advocated by Henry George, but was unsuccessful in getting it adopted in Oregon. After his defeat in a 1914 race for Governor on the single tax platform, he largely withdrew from active politics.\n\nHe died of pneumonia at age 90, in Portland, Oregon on March 8, 1949.\n\n\n"}

Such device was always void at English common law, because it was not deemed as a binding trust, in that the testator can change the disposition of the trust at any time and therefore essentially execute changes to the will without meeting the formalities required for the change. \n\nMore recently, however, a number of jurisdictions have recognized the validity of a pour-over will. In the jurisdictions in the U.S. which allow a pour-over will, testators do not usually put all of their assets into trusts for the reasons of liquidity, convenience, or simply because they did not get around to do so before they died. A pour-over clause in a will gives probate property to a trustee of the testator's separate trust and must be validated either under incorporation by reference by identifying the previously existing trust which the property will be poured into, or under the doctrine of acts of independent significance by referring to some act that has significance apart from disposing of probate assets, namely, the revocable living trust (\"inter vivos\" trust). The testator's property is subject to probate until such time as the pour-over clause is applied, and the estate assets \"pour\" into the trust. The trust instrument must be either in existence at the time when the will with the pour-over clause is executed, or executed concurrently with the will to be a valid pour-over gift. However, the trust need not be funded \"inter vivos\". The pour-over clause protects property not previously placed in a trust by pouring it into the previously established trust through the vehicle of the will.\n\n"}

Starring the eponymous superhero with type 1 diabetes, the game sees the player control Captain Novolin on a quest to save the mayor of Pineville from the supervillain Blubberman. It is a part of educational video game series from Raya that also includes \"\", \"Packy and Marlon\", and \"Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus\".\n\nFunding for the game came from Novo Nordisk (makers of the Novolin brand of insulin) and the National Institutes of Health. To promote the game, Novo Nordisk distributed 10,000 free copies to hospitals. During its initial release, the game was positively received by diabetes specialists, as well as children with the condition; but the retrospective reception from video game critics has been poor, and it has been named as one of the worst video games of all time.\n\nThe game uses a 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay. The plot of \"Captain Novolin\" has the titular hero setting out to save Pineville's diabetic Mayor Gooden from aliens and their leader Blubberman, as the mayor only has enough insulin for 48 hours. Before the game starts, a doctor and dietitian give advice on how to manage one's diet and insulin. Throughout the game, Captain Novolin has to avoid the alien invaders, who have the appearance of junk food items, such as \"Cereal Killer\" and \"Larry Licorice\". Meanwhile, Captain Novolin must eat healthy meals to keep his blood glucose within a safe zone. Captain Novolin can die if his blood glucose level goes too high or low. Players can earn points by keeping Novolin's glucose level in the save zone and defeating the enemy aliens, while receiving bonus points by correctly answering questions that relate to diabetes. In addition, the game has a feature whereby a diabetic player can specify the frequency of their real-life insulin injections.\n\n\"Captain Novolin\" was published by Mountain View, California-based company Raya Systems. The President and founder of Raya, Steve Brown, had previously worked with medical companies, supplying them software applications. His interactions with these companies had led him to the conclusion that there needed to be a new way to give children medical information, including about diabetes. The company teamed up with Novo Nordisk to fund the game, as did the National Institutes of Health. Novo Nordisk also helped design the titular character. Sculptured Software developed for the game. Their previous titles included \"Super Star Wars\" and \"NCAA Basketball\".\n\nNovo Nordisk distributed 10,000 free copies of the game to hospitals in the United States. It was also shown at diabetes summer camps across the US. The game was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1992, exclusively in North America. It is the first game about diabetes self-management. Subsequent games promoting self-management include 2003's \"Diabetes Education for Kids\" for computers and Japanese exclusives \"Detective\" and \"Buildup Blocks\" for the Game Boy Advance in 2004. \"Captain Novolin\" is the first entry in Raya Systems' \"Hero Health\" series, with later games focusing on tobacco (\"\"), asthma (\"Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus\"), and diabetes once again (\"Packy and Marlon\").\n\n\"Captain Novolin\" was warmly received among children with diabetes and their parents. In one study, 23 diabetic children (10 boys and 13 girls in the age range of 6 to 16 years) and the parent of one child were interviewed individually. The children were enthusiastic about the game, with several saying that it would be useful when telling their friends about diabetes. A separate evaluation involved a number of diabetic children aged from 8 to 14, along with their respective parents. Participants said that the game could help parents and children to talk about diabetes, as well as helping children talk to their friends about the subject. Former \"Cheers\" cast member John Ratzenberger, a celebrity volunteer for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, thought the game was fun, feeling that it taught children how to manage their diabetes.\n\nThe magazine \"Esquire\" included \"Captain Novolin\" with their “Dubious Achievement Awards of 1992“, mocking the game's concept and sarcastically preferring “Super Prozac Brothers“. Retrospective reception of the game was widely negative; it was called one of the worst video games of all time. Reviewing \"Captain Novolin\" for \"Hardcore Gaming 101\", Charles P. Gill, criticizing its gameplay, graphics, and sound, considered it \"so bad that it's really, really funny\". Matthew Williamson for \"GameSetWatch\" was negative towards the Captain Novolin sprite, saying that it took up one-third of the screen. Williamson also called the Captain “possibly the worst super hero ever“, noting the character could only attack while in mid-air. Writers for \"Diabetes.co.uk\" also found unintentional humor in the game, made funnier, they said, by its US$60 retail price. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Seanbaby placed it as number 4 in his \"20 worst games of all time\" feature. K. Thor Jensen for \"UGO\" called it one of the worst educational games of all time, while Robert Quigley and Susana Polo from \"The Mary Sue\" named it as one of the weirdest. \"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves considered it to be one of the strangest corporate mascots to get their own video game.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248900", "title": "85D/Boethin", "text": "85D/Boethin\n\nComet Boethin (officially 85D/Boethin) was a periodic Jupiter-family comet discovered in 1975 by Leo Boethin. It appeared again in January 1986 as expected. Although the comet was next expected at perihelion in April 1997, no observations were reported, and the comet is thought to have disintegrated. It has not been observed since March 1986.\n\nThe comet was discovered under unusual circumstances. Comet 85D/Boethin was the first comet discovered by an observer in the Philippines. Leo Boethin (1912-1998), who was assigned as Reverend of the Abra province in 1949, had taken advantage of the exceptionally dark skies of Luzon to observe comets and meteor showers. In January 1973, he found his first suspected comet at magnitude 9.5, but he saw it fading after a few nights down to magnitude 13 before he could send a telegram with his observations to Brian Marsden at the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Marsden, sceptical of the report, responded that a short-lived outburst was possible, but that the discovery could not be confirmed.\n\nFollowing his first observations of comet 85D/Boethin on January 4-7, 1975, Boethin sent a Special Delivery letter to Marsden, reporting the discovery of a possible new comet of magnitude 12, using his 8-inch telescope. Before the invention of email, telegrams were expensive, and Boethin had chosen to send a letter this time. The report took ten days to reach Marsden, and by that time the full Moon made observations impossible. Marsden responded that the delay was unfortunate, and that Boethin should try to cable future reports instead of sending letters, which could take weeks to arrive from the remote Abra province. Marsden was not optimistic that the comet could be recovered. Defying the odds, Boethin was able to observe his comet again in late January and early February, and he sent a telegram to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Using the new report, Marsden was able to calculate an ephemeris for the comet, and it was quickly confirmed by other observers.\nMarsden sent his congratulations, saying that the discovery circumstances had been \"quite incredible\" and that such a delay of confirmation was unheard of since the breakdown of international communication in World War II. \n\nComet 85D/Boethin was quite faint for a visual discovery, which had been made possible only by the very dark skies of Abra province. Observers with telescopes much larger than Boethin's had difficulties to see the object. Marsden noted that this was also true for Boethin's earlier reports from 1973, probably contributing to the unsuccessful confirmation in that case. He offered a free subscription to the IAU Circulars, expressing his hope that Boethin could use the money saved from the subscription to pay for telegrams in case of future discoveries. Boethin never found a new comet again.\n\nIn 2003, Gary Kronk and Brian Marsden noticed that the object that Leo Boethin observed in 1973 was actually 104P/Kowal 2, which had not been officially discovered until 1979. From Boethin's report, it was apparent that comet Kowal 2 had been in a short, major outburst in 1973.\n\n85D/Boethin was a Jupiter-family comet with an orbital period of 11.81 years and a moderate inclination of 4.3°. It had been captured in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter for at least the last couple of centuries. At the time of its discovery, it was only the second object known to be in such resonance, after 56P/Slaughter–Burnham. It has been suggested that comets in this resonance might originate from the Jupiter trojans. 85D/Boethin came within 0.63 AU of Jupiter in August 1995.\n\nIt was to be a target of NASA's EPOXI comet-exploration mission in December 2008; however, the comet was not recovered in time to set up the trajectory for the flyby with sufficient accuracy, and EPOXI switched to its backup target Hartley 2. It is thought that 85D/Boethin may have broken into pieces too small for visual detection. As a result, its designation was changed from 85P to 85D on 9 June 2017, signifying that it has been lost and has possibly broken up.\n\n"}

{"id": "2248906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248906", "title": "Vila Real de Santo António", "text": "Vila Real de Santo António\n\nVila Real de Santo António (, ) is a city, civil parish, and municipality in the Algarve, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 19,156, in an area of 61.25 km². It is one of the few municipalities in Portugal without territorial continuity: its territory comprises two parts, with the municipal seat located in the eastern part. Both the city and the municipality are the southeasternmost of Portugal. Vila Real de Santo António was founded after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and largely expanded in 1774 using the same architectural and construction techniques employed in the reconstruction of Lisbon after the disaster.\n\nThe city is situated next to the Guadiana river. Before the construction of the Guadiana International Bridge (in its neighboring upstream municipality of Castro Marim) it used to be the easiest access to Portugal from Andalusia (via ferry from the Spanish city of Ayamonte across the river). Nevertheless, international movement of people and goods is still intense and much visible in the city.\n\nThe history of settlement in the region pre-dates the Pombalinan community of the 18th century. The coastline area of Vila Real was inhabited by Megalithic tribes who constructed beehive tombs in the area around Nora, near Cacela. The Romans, and much later the Arabs, made the settlement of Cacela an important village during their occupation of the territory, constructing fortifications to protect them from invading bands.\n\nIn 1240, Paio Peres Correia, master of the military Order of Santiago established Cacela as his point of departure for the reconquest of the Algarve, during the Reconquista. Small settlements were eventually established near the Cacela, including many medieval fishing villages, such as Santo António de Arenilha along the coast.\n\nIn the 17th century, the \"vila\" (\"town\") of Santo António was an important frontier outpost, controlling commerce and developing the lucrative fishing grounds, there establishing canning and conservation industry. \nVila Real de Santo António was a relatively recent community; the region was sparsely populated prior to its foundation and Cacela was the municipal seat of the existing municipality. For centuries, Castro Marim was the only large town guarding the border with Spain, and the settlements in the region were small and undefended. On 30 December 1773, during the reign of Joseph I, a royal decree ordering the creation of a new town at the tip of the Algarve. The impetus for this decision is unclear, but there was several justifications for enhancing the settlement of the region, which included: increasing the human presence near the Spanish border, to prevent any incursions; to better control duties charged on cross-border activity; to be better defend the region from a full-scale attack; or to provoke Spain with a modern settlement that was easily seen from Ayamonte; or to simply rebuild the nearby town fishing village of Santo António de Arenilha and resettle its population. Santo António de Arenilha was destroyed by the same tsunami that was triggered by the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\nRegardless, the settlement was erected at great speed for the time (in only two years) and completed in 1776 using the latest technologies. The Marquis of Pombal was responsible for its planning, designing the town in a Pombaline orthogonal grid, which he also used during the reconstruction of Lisbon. In a pioneering technique, entire buildings were prefabricated in areas outside the town, and then transported to their final destination to be assembled, which permitted a fast and methodical construction of the town. Along the river, the customhouses (), was one of the first buildings to be completed during the Pombaline reconstruction, to house the offices of the \"Sociedades das Pescarias\" (fishing associations/societies), and dividing the settlement in two. Vila Real de Santo António thrived on the growth of the fishing industry, which included the processing of species of tuna and sardine.\n\nThe new \"Royal Town\" of Santo António () soon became the seat of the municipality, stripping the once important town of Cacela from this status. Cacela had, in the intervening years, gone into a steady decline as a result of the 1755 earthquake and attacks from English pirates and privateers.\n\nIn 1886, it became the first city in the Algarve to have gas lighting installed.\n\nAs the fishing industry went into decline (around the 1960s), tourism quickly took over as the principal economic livelihood for many of its residents. The extensive stretches of sandy beaches attracted both national and international tourists, especially during the warm season. Monte Gordo is particularly visitor-oriented, counting with many hotels, bars and a casino.\n\nThe municipality is bordered to the north by the municipality of Castro Marim and to the west by the municipality of Tavira. It fronts the Atlantic Ocean to the south, and the Guadiana River to the east, along with its frontier border with the Andalusian municipality of Ayamonte (Spain). Due to its Atlantic frontage, the municipality has several kilometers of continuous sandy beaches.\n\nThe topography of the municipality is diverse. Marshes are common, especially north of the city where a section of the salty wetlands became the Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo António Marsh Natural Reserve (established in 1975, this was continental Portugal's first nature reserve). Woodlands cover the planar civil parishes of Vila Real de Santo António and Monte Gordo, while in Vila Nova de Cacela, barren lands and schist hills are more predominant. The easternmost part of the Ria Formosa system of lagoons is located in this civil parish.\n\nThe establishment, in 1975, of the Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo António Marsh Natural Reserve provided a refuge for several species of migratory and marine birds, namely mallards, flamingos, Kentish plovers, little terns, pied avocets, dunlins, stilts, white storks, and spoonbills, while at the same time protecting breeding grounds for local fish and crustaceans. Chameleons, oysters, and jellyfish (of the genus Rhopilema) are among the species that can be found in the region and its coastal waters, while carob trees, gum rockrose, brooms and almond trees mingle within the forests and brush within the interior.\n\nThe climate of the region is Mediterranean: winters are short and mild, while summers are usually very hot. November and December are the rainiest months, although on average, the municipality has around 300 sunny days a year.\n\nVila Real de Santo António is one of the most densely populated municipalities of the Algarve, with a population density above the national average. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nTuna and sardine fisheries continue to be important to the economy of the region. However, the fish industry went into decline in the 1960s and tourism quickly took over as the economic engine of the municipality, attracting both national and international tourists, especially during the warm season. The tertiary sector, particularly administration/government services and support industries are concentrated in the parish of Vila Real. It is common for inhabitants to commute to Spain for work in the Ayamonte area.\n\nVila Real de Santo António station is the eastern terminus of the railway from Faro and Lagos. The Portuguese Railways operate a direct train service (using Diesel multiple units) to Lagos with connections to mainline electric trains at Faro.\n\nThe municipality's close proximity to the main A22 roadway enables easy access west, to other parts of the country, or into Spain. Despite the opening of the Guadiana International Bridge in 1991, the small car ferry across the river still operates.\n\nSeveral artists were born and/or worked in Vila Real de Santo António, providing a rich heritage in literature and visual arts. The native poet António Aleixo was particularly prominent. Xylographer Manuel Cabanas stood out in the city's artistic panorama and was a fierce opponent of the Portuguese dictatorship.\n\nThe Vila Real \"Complexo Desportivo\" is a centre for national- and international-level high-performance training camps, with several sporting clubs using it for athletic preparation. Located near the town of Monte Gordo, it is situated near other sporting facilities and lodgings.\n\n"}
{"id": "2248907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248907", "title": "Appointment to the Order of Canada", "text": "Appointment to the Order of Canada\n\nAppointment into the Order of Canada is the process by which citizens of Canada or certain foreign persons are inducted into the Order of Canada, the second highest civilian honour within the Canadian system of honours. Any living Canadian or foreign national may be nominated for appointment; however, the advisory council of the Order of Canada and the Governor General of Canada make the final decision on appointments. Members of the order may also be elevated within it if he or she has continued to provide service to Canada, or to humanity in general, after their appointment.\n\nParagraph nine of the Constitution of the Order of Canada lists the criteria for appointment to the order. All living Canadians are eligible for any of the three levels of the order, except federal and provincial politicians and judges while they are holding office. Multiple people who have committed the same honourable act or deed are also eligible for induction; for example, all three members of the band Rush (Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart) have been appointed as Officers of the order, the first time a group, rather than an individual, was appointed to the Order of Canada. All three members of the children's group Sharon, Lois & Bram (Sharon Trostin Hampson, Lois Lilienstein, and Bramwell Morrison) have also been made members of the order – although, since Lilienstein is an American citizen, she was made an honorary member.\n\nA new member whose appointment is approved during their lifetime but who dies prior to either the announcement of that appointment or their investiture, may be invested posthumously. The 2005 appointment of journalist Peter Jennings was announced under these circumstances; his daughter, Elizabeth Jennings, accepted the insignia on her father's behalf in October, 2006. The oldest person ever to be invested into the order was Cornelius Wiebe, who was 106 years old at the time of his investiture in 1999.\n\nCommonly, influential political leaders, such as former prime ministers, will be appointed after they leave office. John Diefenbaker was the only living former prime minister not to be appointed to the Order of Canada; after losing the prime ministership to Lester B. Pearson in 1963, Diefenbaker remained a sitting member of parliament and died while still in office in 1979, never becoming eligible. Others, such as former New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent and former Prime Minister Joe Clark, were appointed after exiting politics, only to later return to elected office. There have also been several senators who were appointed to the order prior to taking office; as of 2011 there are 15 senators who belong to the order: Tommy Banks, Roméo Dallaire, Trevor Eyton, Irving Gerstein, Nancy Greene, Serge Joyal, Wilbert Keon, Jean Lapointe, Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, Frank Mahovlich, Donald Oliver, Kelvin Ogilvie, Nancy Ruth, Hugh Segal and Pamela Wallin. Further, in the same vein as prime ministers being appointed after leaving office, every Chief Justice of Canada from Robert Taschereau onward has been made a Companion. Individuals who hold a ceremonial political office (for example a Sergeant-at-arms) are considered public servants and therefore can be invested while serving in that office. There is no rule that Order of Canada members cannot be inducted to any of the Canadian provincial or territorial orders. For example, Gordon Lightfoot is both a Companion of the Order of Canada and member of the Order of Ontario, and Oscar Peterson, who was born in Montreal but resided in Ontario during his later years, was simultaneously a Companion of the Order of Canada, Knight of the National Order of Quebec, and a member of the Order of Ontario.\n\nMedia magnate Conrad Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour, was the only non-honorary member of the Order of Canada who did not hold Canadian citizenship. Black was appointed as an Officer of the order in 1990, and surrendered his Canadian citizenship in 2001 to overcome political hurdles preventing his appointment to the House of Lords. Black was convicted of mail fraud in 2007. It was announced on January 31, 2014 that he will be removed from the Order of Canada by Gov. Gen. David Johnston.\n\nThe Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall, which administers the Canadian honours system, permits anyone to submit nominations for the Order of Canada any time of the year. A form is completed – including notes on the candidate's life and accomplishments, the nominator's and the candidate's information (such as birth, citizenship, address, and occupation), and three supporters of the nomination – and sent to the Chancellery. Once there, the letter is kept in a file unannounced, due to privacy of the nominee and the person who made the nomination.\n\nTo be considered for appointment for the rank of Companion, one must have made \"outstanding achievement and merit of the highest degree, especially in service to Canada or to humanity at large.\" The order's constitution dictates that two people are automatically made Extraordinary Companions to the order: the Governor General, and his or her spouse.\n\nThe Governor General and his or her spouse will each continue to be Companions of the order until they are deceased. If the maximum number of 165 Companions has been reached, no more appointments can be made until a vacancy occurs, which can come due to death, resignation of the Companion, or the removal of the individual from the order. Each year up to 15 people can be either appointed to the grade directly or promoted from the grade of Officer to Companion; however, the four honorary Companions living today do not count towards the 165 total. The ex-officio Companions, which currently comprise Edward Schreyer, Lily Schreyer, Gerda Hnatyshyn, Diana Fowler LeBlanc, Adrienne Clarkson, John Ralston Saul, Michaëlle Jean, Jean-Daniel Lafond, David Johnston, Sharon Johnston and Queen Elizabeth II, are not counted toward the maximum number of Companions. From 1997 until his appointment as Governor General in 2011 David Johnston held a substantive appointment as a Companion.\n\nA person can be appointed to the rank of Officer for \"achievement and merit of a high degree, especially service to Canada or to humanity at large.\" Unlike the rank of Companion, there is no limit on how many Officers can be living at one time, though the Governor General may only appoint up to sixty-four Officers per year, excluding honorary appointments. A person can become an Officer by being promoted from the grade of Member or being appointed directly to the rank.\n\nA person can be appointed to the rank of Member for \"distinguished service in or to a particular community, group or field of activity.\" There is no limit to how many Members can be living at one time, though the Governor General may only appoint up to 136 Members per year.\n\nA non-Canadian can be considered for membership in all three grades; however, the Governor General can only make five of these appointments per year. Honorary members are allowed to use post-nominal letters and wear the insignia in public.\n\nOnce the nomination has been received by the Chancellery of Honours, it will be evaluated by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada. The members of the Council evaluate and vote on each nomination at their meetings. At the end of each meeting, their recommendations will be sent to the Governor General. The Governor General will follow the recommendations and will sign an Instrument appointing the members to the Order.\n\nThe names of inductees into the Order of Canada are announced twice annually, once around New Year's Day (January 1) and again around Canada Day (July 1).\nInduction ceremonies are generally conducted by the Governor General at Rideau Hall in Ottawa or, on rare occasions, by the Queen herself; Elizabeth II performed her first Order of Canada investiture at Rideau Hall in August, 1973. The 2002 ceremony was held at Halifax's Pier 21 to mark the 50th anniversary of Canadian Governors General, but the most common reason for the insignia not being presented at Rideau Hall is the recipient's inability to travel to Ottawa. An early example of this occurred in 1980 when activist athlete Terry Fox was dying of terminal cancer. A more recent example occurred in 2003 with singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot: in 2002, shortly before a concert, Lightfoot suffered a serious abdominal hemorrhage that resulted in his being in a coma for a time and months in hospital recovering. On the news of his near-death condition, Lightfoot was promoted to the rank of Companion. Since his condition left him unable to travel, Adrienne Clarkson flew to Toronto and presented him with the insignia in a private ceremony performed in his hospital room. Similarly, in 2000 Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, at the age of 100, was invested as an Honorary Companion at Clarence House in London. Rather than place the insignia on the Queen Mother, who was recovering from a hip replacement, Clarkson handed Her Majesty her badge. Her Majesty made a point of wearing it around her neck at a special lunch following the private ceremony. Inductions can also be delegated to another individual, such as a Lieutenant Governor, as was the case when Mervyn Wilkinson was inducted into the order by Iona Campagnolo, the then Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, in 2002. Investitures can also be delayed, such as in the case of Wayne Gretzky, who was appointed to the grade of Officer in 1984 for his outstanding contributions to the game of hockey. However, as the ceremonies always conflicted with his hockey schedule, it was not until over 13 years, and two governors general, later that Gretzky could personally be invested into the order. The longest delay between appointment and investiture was the 23-year delay of W. Bruce Hutchison. Hutchison was appointed in July 1967, but did not attend the investiture ceremony until April 1990 \n\nPrior to Clarkson becoming Governor General of Canada, Order of Canada inductions were rarely performed outside of Rideau Hall or the Governor General's secondary residence La Citadelle. Under her tenure Clarkson held entire investment ceremonies in cities like St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Vancouver, British Columbia. She was also noted for delegating the duty to other individuals on certain occasions when it would have been difficult for her or the recipient to travel.\n\nPrior to the 1970s honorary appointments to the order had to be approved by Cabinet. This bureaucratic hurdle resulted in there being no honorary appointments to the order until the 1980s. In 1972 John Grierson was expected to be authorized as the first honorary companion by Cabinet, and notice of his appointment was prepared in advance of cabinet rubber stamping the nomination. However, Grierson died one day before his appointment could be finalized. This incident was a driving force in devolving this procedure from the entire cabinet, to the minister of foreign affairs.\n\nThe appointment process for the Order of Canada is notable for being mostly removed from the active partisan influence normally seen in the British honours system. Unlike in many nations, active federal and provincial politicians cannot be admitted into the order until they exit elected office. Nevertheless, there have been some occasions where the House of Commons has felt it necessary to interfere. The most notable (and perhaps most successful) was Zena Sheardown, the first honorary appointment to the Order. Sheardown sheltered four American diplomats in her house for months during the Canadian Caper. While others involved in the scheme were admitted into the order, Sheardown was not. Her appointment was delayed because she was not a Canadian citizen. Flora MacDonald had to ask for, and receive authorization from the House of Commons that Sheardown deserved membership in the order before her appointment was seriously considered.\n\nIt is also notable that occasionally sitting members of the House of Commons rise to offer congratulations to people in their districts who have been admitted into the order. Some speakers of the House have discouraged this practice because it blurs the line between partisan politics and the apolitical nature of the order.\n\nOn rare occasions, some sitting politicians have been known to comment on controversial appointments to the Order of Canada. When Dr. Henry Morgentaler was appointed a member of the Order of Canada, Maurice Vellacott, a Conservative member of Parliament known for his pro-life views, told \"The Globe and Mail\", \"There are so many deserving Canadians, there was no need to choose somebody like Dr. Morgentaler.\".\n\nThe New Democratic Party called for the Governor-General to remove Conrad Black from the Order following his conviction for obstruction of justice.\n\n"}

It was named after Providence, Rhode Island, where C. A. Stuart and colleagues studied these bacteria at Brown University. \n\nSome species are opportunistic pathogens in humans. \"Providencia stuartii\" can cause urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters or extensive severe burns. Alternatively, \"Providencia rettgeri\" is a common cause of traveller's diarrhoea.\n\nMany strains have been isolated from the haemolymph of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" fruit flies. These strains display different levels of virulence. For example \"Providencia sneebia\" is highly virulent, and infection always results in fly mortality. Alternatively, \"P. rettgeri\" displays an intermediate virulence wherein some individuals survive infection, while others perish. The susceptibility to \"P. rettgeri\" is strongly tied to an allele of the antimicrobial peptide gene Diptericin. Surprisingly, the fly's defence against \"P. rettgeri\" seems to rely almost exclusively on Diptericin, as deletion of Diptericin leads to complete mortality. Meanwhile deletion of multiple other antimicrobial peptides has no effect on \"P. rettgeri\" virulence. Yet defence against \"P. burhodogranariea\" is determined by multiple antimicrobial peptides beyond just Diptericin. Why Diptericin is so specifically important in defence against one species of Providencia is not clear, but could yield insight into how bacterial species evolve resistance or susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds.\n\n"}

From 1975 to 1978 he was barman on Lundy Island \"so that he could act as the Lundy Field Society's unofficial representative and warden in his free time.\"\n\nRogers' reputation among the British birding community was of someone who took the scientific study of birds extremely seriously, and believed that \"serious\" ornithology should take precedence over \"popular\" approaches at all times. As an illustration, following the publication in \"British Birds\" magazine of an account by Robin Chittenden of the finding of a northern parula on the Isles of Scilly in October 1983 (Chittenden 1986), in which Chittenden wrote effusively about his excitement at this find, which was then only the fourth record for Britain, Rogers wrote to the \"British Birds\" letters page criticising both Chittenden for an article consisting of \"60 lines full of irrelevances\", and the journal's editors for \"letting editorial standards slip ... perhaps in an attempt to widen [the journal's] circulation\" (Rogers 1987).

The Gold Sticks, of whom one at any time is on duty as Gold Stick-in-Waiting, were originally entrusted with the personal safety of the Sovereign. Since the reign of Queen Victoria these officers' duties have been mainly ceremonial; they attend all state occasions and take part in the processions for the Coronation and the State Opening of Parliament.

{"id": "2248959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248959", "title": "Alcúdia", "text": "Alcúdia\n\nAlcúdia \n() is a municipality and township of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.\nIt is the main tourist centre in the North of Majorca on the eastern coast. It is a large resort popular with families. Most of the hotels are located in Port d'Alcúdia and Platja d'Alcúdia along the 14 km long beach that stretches all the way to Can Picafort. In Alcúdia the old town is well preserved with houses dating back to the 13th century. The old town is surrounded by a medieval wall.\n\nThe area where Alcúdia is located has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, but it is with the arrival of the Romans that the city makes its entry in the history books. The Romans used the beaches of Alcúdia bay when they captured the island in 123 B.C. Shortly after this the capital Palma was founded and then the city of Pollentia. From Pollentia it was possible to view both the bay of Pollenca and the bay of Alcúdia. Pollentia served as a guard for other invaders. The city was also mentioned in Rome since they here produced excellent fabrics that were used in the most exclusive togas.\n\nAfter Rome lost its position as the dominant power in the western Mediterranean, Pollentia was attacked by pirates and several times by the Vandals. Finally, the city was abandoned, and the remaining population left to create a new town at a more protected location. This town became Pollenca and the area where Pollentia stood was left to ruins.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Moors, a farmstead was created very close to where the ancient village of Pollentia had been. The farm was called Alcúdia, which is Arabic for \"on the hill\". In 1229, the Moors were defeated by King James I of Aragon, who overtook the power of the area. In 1298, King James II of Aragon bought the farmstead Alcúdia and founded the new town. A church, a graveyard, a house for priests, and a square were created in the same year. The construction of the walls was also initiated at the same time and finished in 1362. The city plan that was made at the time remains the same for Alcúdia today. During the Renaissance, walls were reconstructed, and a second wall was constructed outside the first one. This wall has since been torn down and only details show where it once was.\n\nDuring the 16th century pirates attacked the city several times. The population shrank, and there was from time to time a risk that the city would be abandoned totally. In 1779 a decision was taken to support the city by constructing a harbour. This really improved the economy of Alcúdia and the village was saved. But it remained a rather small and poor village.\n\nIn the 1920s the first tourists began to visit Mallorca and also Alcúdia. This was in a very limited scale and the economy of the village stayed weak. In the early '70s it started to be clear that the future of Alcúdia would be in tourism. 15 years later the old harbour of Puerto de Alcúdia had developed into a major resort for European tourism. In the '90s the construction boom calmed down and several regulations were put in place to secure the quality of the resort. The focus is on visitors searching for both relaxation and activity. A golf course has been constructed and both bicycle and hiking trips are commonplace. The old town has been preserved and pedestrianised. It has now become one of the most visited villages in Majorca.\n\nThe old town has a 14th-century wall and it is possible to step up on the wall and follow it almost all around the village. There are remains of a Roman town just outside the medieval town walls, in front of the Church of St. Jaume, belonging to the ancient city of Pollentia (see also the Italian Pollentia). There is also a small Roman theatre. North of the town is a bull ring from the 19th century.\n\nThe old town also hosts a market both on Sundays and Tuesdays all year round. Inside the walls there are several popular restaurants and bistros famous for good home-cooked food in small settings. In Port d'Alcúdia most of the restaurants are located around the marina. Most of these restaurants are only open in the tourist season. Further north and west are some coves and beaches ideal for sunbathing, swimming or snorkeling.\nThe beach at Alcúdia is c. 14 km long and stretches as far as C'an Picafort. Alcúdia joins onto Playa de Muro which is home to S'Albufera; a natural park that is very popular with birders.\n\nAlcúdia celebrates the festival of St. Jaume every summer. It goes on for nine days at the beginning of July. Before the festival starts the town is decorated and each street picks out a theme for that year's look. During the festival several traditional evening festivities are arranged in the old town such as the Night of the Romans where the streets are full of locals dressed in traditional ancient Roman dresses. There are also outdoor theatres, sport tournaments, exhibitions and the traditional bullfight. The fiesta is finished with La Noche de Sant Jaume, a fireworks display and philharmonic concert by the old walls.\n\nAlcúdia hosts also many other fairs and festivals throughout the year. During the summer, there are plenty of al fresco events, with dramatised tours of the old town, and theatre productions in the old Roman amphitheatre. The Alcúdia Jazz Festival starts at the end of August and runs for a month. International sporting events are held down the road at the port, with an Ironman Triathlon twice a year, beach volleyball and beach rugby... There is an agricultural fair in the Autumn at the beginning of October and a nautical fair in April, which features the cuttlefish.\n\nTaking place every three years is the Triennial of Sant Crist, a religious procession where the population slowly walks barefoot through the town in silence, for several hours. The origin of this procession dates back to 1507. According to tradition, the image of Sant Crist sweated blood and water, thus putting an end to a drought. \nAlcúdia is home to UD Alcúdia who plays at Els Arcs, which has a capacity of 1,750.\n\nAlcúdia is home to one of Europe's largest hotel complexes, Bellevue. With 8 swimming pools and 17 apartment blocks the complex is set in 150,000 square meters of gardens.\n\nAlcúdia tourist guide\nThings to see in Alcúdia\n"}

They are also eligible to command the higher echelons of those units, such as destroyer and submarine squadrons, air wings and air groups, and special warfare groups.\n\nAt the flag officer level, URL officers may also command carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, patrol and reconnaissance groups, task forces, and fleet and force commands. URL officers are also eligible to command shore installations, facilities and activities directly supporting the navy's warfare mission.\n\nURL officers include officers from the Surface Warfare, Submarine Warfare, Naval Aviation, and Special Warfare communities, i.e., the Navy's combat communities. In this sense, all URL officers are considered warfare specialists and are designated as either Surface Warfare Officers, Submarine Warfare Officers, Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers, SEAL/Special Warfare Officers, or Special Operations Officers (primarily Diver or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Officer/Diver).\n\nA URL community previously known as \"General Unrestricted Line\" has been phased out and no longer accepting new entrants. Officers in this category were not warfare qualified, nor on track to be warfare qualified, and were typically assigned to administrative and support tasks ashore. General URL officers have been replaced by the expansion of the Restricted Line Officer (RL) community into their former skillsets, with most incumbents laterally transferring into the Restricted Line.\n\nDifferentiated from URL officers are those naval officers whose functions are considered combat support in nature and are designated as either restricted line (RL) officers or staff corps officers. \n\nExamples of RL officers include Engineering Duty Officer, Aeronautical Engineering Duty Officer, Aircraft Maintenance Officer, Intelligence Officer, Cryptologic Warfare (formerly Information Warfare) Officer, Meteorology/Oceanography Officer, Public Affairs Officer, Human Resources Officer, and Foreign Area Officer among others. \n\nExamples of Staff Corps officers include Supply Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Civil Engineer Corps, Judge Advocate General's Corps and Chaplain Corps.\n\nSome RL officers begin their careers as URL officers and transition to RL, the most common examples being Surface Warfare Officers and Submarine Warfare Officers who become Engineering Duty Officers and Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers who become Aeronautical Engineering Duty Officers. Still other URL officers will transition into Staff Corps communities, most often the Medical Corps or the Judge Advocate General's Corps following completion of Navy-funded medical school or law school, while others move into other RL or Staff Corps fields. The remaining officers are directly commissioned as RL or Staff Corps. RL and Staff Corps officers are authorized to command ashore within their particular speciality, but are not eligible for combatant command at sea, which remains strictly within the purview of URL officers.\n\nIn contrast to the U.S. Navy's limited duty officers (LDO) and chief warrant officers (CWO), who are directly accessed from the senior enlisted grades (E-6 to E-9 and W-2 to W-5 for LDO; E-7 to E-9 for CWO), traditional unrestricted line officers are required to possess at least a bachelor's degree and complete some type of formal pre-commissioning accession program, such as:\n\nSome senior URL officers in current service as naval aviators or naval flight officers were also commissioned via the since disestablished Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS), either under traditional AOCS or via its former subset Aviation Reserve Officer Candidate (AVROC) or Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD) programs. AOCS was merged into the current Officer Candidate School in the late 1990s.\n\nThe United States Navy takes most of its traditions, customs and organizational structure from that of the Royal Navy of Great Britain. Based on the Royal Navy model, there were originally two kinds of officers on a naval ship of the line: the commanding officers and their First Officers, who were \"gentlemen\" and commanded the ship; and the warrant officers, who were technical specialists who ran important tasks. In the nineteenth century, with the introduction of steam power, a third group of officers emerged, engineers, who ran the steam plant. As technology developed, the engineers were requesting more rights, including command. This system evolved in similar fashion in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War and in the successor United States Navy into the nineteenth century. Eventually, this dispute led the Department of the Navy to abolish the differences between the groups, amalgamating them into Unrestricted Line Officers in 1899. This fact can lead to confusion with non-American naval personnel, lacking the division between the two groups. The Russian Navy is an example of one with a difference between Deck and Engineer officers.\n\n"}

The term \"Bloggernacle\" was coined by individuals within the LDS blogging community as a play on the name of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; however, not all LDS-themed bloggers like or use the name Bloggernacle, or even consider their blog to be part of it. Furthermore, not all bloggers within the Mormon blogosphere are Mormons themselves.\n\nIt was on November 23, 2002, that the Mormon blogging community became a distinct entity with the founding of the blog Metaphysical Elders. Some component blogs from the Mormon blogosphere's first two years were short lived, however one of its first bloggers, Dave Banack, began his longstanding Mormon Inquiry blog on August 19, 2003. On January 1, 2003, a multi-author blog Mormon Momma launched – a spin-off from the original \"Circle of Sisters\" column from \"Meridian Magazine\". By the next two years, many multi-author blogs were launched, including Times and Seasons, By Common Consent, Feminist Mormon Housewives, Millennial Star. On March 23, 2004, due to an article in \"The Revealer\", the writer Kaimi Wenger at the LDS blog Times and Seasons noticed that the Jewish and Catholic blogging communities had adopted names for themselves. In a blog post titled \"The Nameless Mormon Blogosphere\", Wenger sought to remedy this situation and asked for suggestions for a name. Christopher Bradford posting under the name \"Grasshopper\" suggested \"Bloggernacle Choir\", the shortened version of which gained wide approval. \"Bloggernacle\" is a term that has been used commonly by LDS bloggers.\n\nThe Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research features an LDS-apologetics website and blog; Jeff Lindsay writes a Mormon apologetic blog entitled Mormanity, as well. A Mormon \"litblog\" named \"A Motley Vision\" was founded in 2004 by William Morris. During 2005, several LDS-themed podcasts entered the Bloggernacle to augment LDS blogging with audio programming; these included podcasts produced by church affiliated sources and an independent series, Mormon Stories Podcast, produced by John Dehlin (who has also founded the blog Stay LDS and the group blog Mormon Matters).\n\nStay-at-home mothers who are LDS and who blog are known to comment occasionally upon their religion; two such writers whose blogs have become popular with non-Mormon audiences are Stephanie Nielson, of the blog the NieNie Dialogues, C. Jane Kendrick of CJane Enjoy It, and Jana Mathews who blogs at \"Momlogic\" as \"The Meanest Mom\". (A spoof on this genre of blog is the blog \"Seriously, so Blessed!\", written by an anonymous Utah woman.) In 2009, the religious news site \"Religion Dispatches\" ran a story about the phenomenon of Mormon mommy blogging, which its author believed arose in part in response to Elder Ballard's 2007 commencement address at Brigham Young University–Hawaii, which had lauded efforts by Mormon faithful to share their beliefs through such means as blogging, citing an online post by \"Bookslinger\" (pseudonymous author of the blog \"Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon\").\n\nMormon videographer Seth Adam Smith began blogging in 2004. Some of the Bloggernacle's more prominent blogs are named after defunct Latter Day Saint publications. For example, \"Messenger and Advocate\", a blog written by Guy Murray, was named after the LDS publication of the same name published 1834–1837 in Kirtland, Ohio. \"Keepapitchinin\", a Mormon history blog written by \"Salt Lake Tribune\" columnist and independent historian Ardis Parshall that she founded in 2008, was named after a sporadically published humorous newspaper published 1867–1871 and pseudonymously written by three sons of LDS apostles, George J. Taylor, Joseph C. Rich, and Heber John Richards. The blog \"Millennial Star\" was named after \"The Latter-day Saints' Millennial Star,\" published in England 1840–1970; and the LDS history blog \"The Juvenile Instructor\"'\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah's \"The Deseret News\" began producing a separate, LDS-themed newspaper insert on January 10, 2008 named \"Mormon Times.\" The website version of this insert features readers' feedback. The \"Mormon Times\" reporter covering the Bloggernacle is Emily W. Jensen. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' own Internet presence is substantial; and Church spokesman Michael Otterson's blogging contributions feature prominently in the LDS blogosphere as well. \"Linescratchers,\" an LDS contemporary music scene blog, also debuted in 2008.\n\nNeylan McBaine founded \"The Mormon Women Project\" in 2010.\n\n, the Latter-day Saint church has sponsored a blog at its LDS Newsroom's website, churchofjesuschrist.org.\n\nFrom May 30, 2005 until just before Halloween of the same year, six bloggers carried out an elaborate and, ultimately very controversial prank through a fake blog called \"Banner of Heaven\", a name derived from part of the name of a book of non-fiction by Jon Krakauer. Those involved in the prank were eventually exposed through a Bloggernacle-wide contest hosted at \"9 Moons\", another group blog. Although many people found the content on \"Banner of Heaven\" to be humorous, others found the deception to be very off-putting, and the Mormon blogging community engaged in multiple bouts of debate and protest over the ramifications of such a hoax. After seeing the extreme negative reaction, the perpetrators posted public apologies, although some of these were not well received by the community. , the \"Banner of Heaven\" hoax continued to elicit strong debate whenever the subject was broached, and the hoax constituted one of the most important or defining events in the history of Mormon blogging.\n\nBecause of the controversy, the \"Banner of Heaven\" weblog was taken down and made not accessible until Scott B. of \"By Common Consent\" initiated a resurrection of the blog in order to conduct a five-year retrospective on the scandal. The blog is now permanently hosted by MormonMentality.org, a group blog founded by David K. Landrith, one of the perpetrators behind the hoax.\n\nMany blogs, including group blogs with multiple authors and solo blogs with a single author (many of which have also contributed material to group blogs) have played a role in the development and expansion of the Bloggernacle.\n\n\nNumerous blog aggregators, or portals, have been constructed by participants in the Bloggernacle. The most prominent and widely recognized portal is the Mormon Archipelago (or MA), which was created in 2005 \"to be a useful central place to see what's going on at all of the best blogs in the Bloggernacle.\" The MA displays LDS-themed blogs, grouped together in various boxes or \"islands\", with the newest content in each blog on top, with sidebars displaying links to recent comments around the Bloggernacle. Over time, the location with the MA, removal of blogs, or addition of blogs has resulted in disputes over the role the MA plays in Mormon blogging.\n\nIn addition to the MA, other LDS Blog Aggregators include:\n\nFor many, these online networks focusing on religion and sexual orientation function as a family of choice—a committed relationship network bound by friendship rather than blood. Sociocultural psychologists Chana Etengoff and Colette Daiute suggest that online family of choice structures are characterized by members' access to and awareness of other individual members, dialogues about positive and negative experiences, empathy and relatedness, as well as unconditional group membership. Establishing supportive and validating systems of nonbiological relations is often imperative for LGBTQ persons as this can help facilitate relational resilience (i.e., providing and receiving social support), thereby buffering the impact of minority stress (i.e., tensions between majority and minority culture) and family of origin (birth) rejection. It is important to note that such online mental health benefits seem to be LGBTQ specific; indeed, in contrast, many media scholars report that online engagement is generally associated with increases in anxiety, loneliness, and social isolation. It is possible that LGBTQ persons are more likely to benefit from online communications than heterosexual persons, as LGBTQ social networking is more focused on redefining cultural narratives and identity development. However, further research is still needed to determine if these online communication goals generalize to all members of the LGBTQ community or across online communication systems (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).\n\nSince 2005, the Mormon blogging community has given out \"Niblet Awards\" (or just \"Niblets\") to recognize outstanding contributions to the bloggernacle. These awards have typically been awarded on the basis of open nominations and voting, while the location of the awards and voting has varied from year to year. The term \"Niblet\" is an homage to Hugh Nibley, one of the most distinguished and beloved Mormon scholars. Categories for the awards include \"Best Big Blog\", \"Best Individual/Solo Blog\", \"Best Post\", \"Best Humorous Post\", \"Best Blog Design\", \"Best Overall Blogger\", and numerous other categories. The Niblets often cause arguments and disputes within the bloggernacle, as there are frequently disagreements over which blogs should properly be considered members of the \"bloggernacle community\" and which blogs are simply Mormon-themed. Consequently, in 2011 there were no awards. In 2013 Wheat and Tares created the Wheaties and Tareific awards, picking up where the Niblets left off.\n\nThe host site for the 2009 Niblet awards, \"Mormon Matters\", compiled records of past winners as part of the awards. Among the winners were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Several other species in the genus \"Withania\" are morphologically similar. Although commonly used as a medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine, there is no conclusive clinical evidence that it is effective for treating any ailment.\n\nThis species is a short, tender perennial shrub growing tall. Tomentose branches extend radially from a central stem. Leaves are dull green, elliptic, usually up to 10–12 cm (4 to 5 in) long. The flowers are small, green and bell-shaped. The ripe fruit is orange-red.\n\nThe species name \"somnifera\" means \"sleep-inducing\" in Latin. The name, \"ashwagandha\", is a combination of the Sanskrit words \"ashva\", meaning horse, and \"gandha\", meaning smell, reflecting that the root has a strong horse-like odor.\n\n\"Withania somnifera\" is cultivated in many of the drier regions of India. It is also found in Nepal, China and Yemen. It prefers dry stony soil with sun to partial shade. To propagate it can be grown from seed in the early spring, or from greenwood cuttings in the later spring.\n\n\"Withania somnifera\" is prone to several pests and diseases. Leaf spot disease caused by \"Alternaria alternata\" is the most prevalent disease, which occurs in a severe form in Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. A decline in the concentration of its secondary metabolites occurs by leaf spot disease. A treehopper feeds on the apical portions of the stem, making them rough and woody in appearance and brown in colour.\n\nThe carmine red spider mite (\"Tetranychus urticae\") is the most prevalent pest of the plant in India. In recent years, this plant has been serving as a new reservoir host for an invasive mealybug species \"Phenacoccus solenopsis\".\n\nThe main phytochemical constituents are withanolides – which are triterpene lactones – withanolides, withaferin A, alkaloids, steroidal lactones, tropine, and cuscohygrine. Some 40 withanolides, 12 alkaloids, and numerous sitoindosides have been isolated. Withanolides are structurally similar to the ginsenosides of \"Panax ginseng\", leading to a common name for \"W. somnifera\", \"Indian ginseng\".\n\nThe plant, particularly its root powder, has been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine. Mainly due to the poor quality of clinical research, there is no high-quality evidence that it provides any medicinal benefit and may cause adverse effects if taken together with prescription drugs. Dietary supplements containing ashwagandha are marketed in the U.S., but there is no evidence they have any effect.\n"}
{"id": "2248978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248978", "title": "Metallic K.O.", "text": "Metallic K.O.\n\nMetallic K.O. is a live recording by American hard rock band The Stooges. In its original form, the album was purported to contain the last half of a performance at the Michigan Palace in Detroit, on February 9, 1974—the band's final live performance until their reformation in 2003. The performance was notable for the level of audience hostility, with the band being constantly pelted with pieces of ice, eggs, beer bottles and jelly beans, among other things, in response to Iggy Pop's audience-baiting.\n\nSubsequent investigation of the master tapes and the May 1988 release of the double album \nMetallic 2X K.O. reveals that the original album contained the last half of the February 9, 1974 show, but opened with the first half of an earlier show (from October 6, 1973) at the same venue. The \"2X K.O.\" version features the full shows from both dates.\n\nIn 1998, the album was re-released under the original title with a reverse show order, (mostly) expanded track lengths and even more complete set-lists.\n\nThe album was recorded on a reel-to-reel tape machine by Michael Tipton, later obtained by Stooges guitarist James Williamson. Considering Williamson's involvement, and the endorsement of Iggy, it was considered a \"semi-official\" bootleg, when released on the Skydog label in 1976.\n\nThe album is mostly composed of previously unreleased material. Studio demo and rehearsal recordings of some of the songs would later turn up on similarly semi-official posthumous Stooges compilations.\n\nThe album proved popular, due to its release in the first era of punk rock and The Stooges' growing legend as protopunks. \"Metallic K.O.\" outsold The Stooges' major label official releases, selling over 100,000 copies in America as an import in its first year alone.\n\nThe album is notable for Iggy Pop's vulgar rendition of \"Louie, Louie\", which deviates wildly from the song's original lyrics. Overall, the playing on the album is ragged, and during \"Rich Bitch\" the band go out of time with each other, having to be coached back into the song by Iggy - \"Gimme just the drums! It's the only way you're ever gonna get it right, take it down to the drums!\". He then counts the other players back into the beat. In addition to long-time Stooges members Pop, Ron Asheton (bass guitar), Scott Asheton (drums), and Williamson (guitar), the line-up on the album features Scott Thurston on piano, who had become an official member of the band by this point.\n\nIn the essay \"Iggy Pop: Blowtorch in Bondage\" critic Lester Bangs calls the album a \"documentation of the Iggy holocaust at its most nihilistically out of control.\" He describes the Stooges concert he attended that immediately preceded the \"Metallic K.O.\" performances:\nAll songs written by Iggy Pop and James Williamson, except where noted.\n\nThere have been many wildly varying releases of \"Metallic K.O.\" over the years on many different labels. This track listing is based on the first release, the 1976 Skydog LP.\n\nAll tracks were recorded in Detroit's Michigan Palace. Side one was recorded on October 6, 1973; side two was recorded on February 9, 1974. The 1974 show was the final Stooges show until the band's reunion in 2003.\n\n\n\nThis expanded version of the album includes the complete shows from both 1973 and 1974. The 1973 show is presented on sides one and two; the 1974 show is presented on sides three and four. The track times are taken from the original, vinyl release and do not include Iggy's audience baiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Jungle Records re-released the album with a reverse show order, (mostly) expanded track lengths and more complete set-lists.\n\n\n\n"}

It ran both off-Broadway and on Broadway in 1999–2002. It consists of three separate one-act dance plays.\n\n\"Contact\" premiered at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, on September 9, 1999 (after 1999 workshop productions of parts of the show), then moved to Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, on March 30, 2000 and played for 1,010 performances there.\n\nThe show was received with critical acclaim and won the 2000 Tony Award for Best Musical (among others). The award was controversial because \"Contact\" contains no original music or live singing, and in response, a new award for Best Special Theatrical Event was introduced the following year.\n\nA West End production opened at the Queen's Theatre in October 2002, and closed on May 10, 2003. The \nmusical toured from May 2001 to June 2002, and started again in November 2002 in Toronto.\n\nThe original cast album was released on March 6, 2001. PBS included the show's final performance in its program Live from Lincoln Center on September 1, 2002. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Classical Music-Dance Program.\n\nAmong regional productions, the musical was presented by the Virginia Stage Company (Norfolk, Virginia) in April 2006. This was the first regional theater in the US to present \"Contact\" after the Broadway, national tour and London productions and was directed by Tome Cousin, an original cast member (who was chosen by Stroman to direct).\n\nThe show was produced at the North Shore Music Theatre (Beverly, Massachusetts) in June 2008, with Jarrod Emick and Naomi Hubert and directed by Tomé Cousin. In conjunction with the Sarasota Ballet, the Asolo Repertory Theatre's October 23 – November 22, 2009 at the Mertz Theatre in Sarasota, Florida starred Shannon Lewis, Feltcher McTaggart, Sean Ewing, Nadine Isenegger, Ariel Shepley, Steven Sofia, and Wilson Mendieta.

It closed on May 10, 2003.\n\nThe musical was produced in Lodz, Poland at the Opera Lodz in 2010.

Both versions starred Joo Won Kim, Homin Kim, Kyoung Hoon Choi, Ji Sun Kim, Dong Ju Kang, and Sam Jin Lee. Directed by Tome' Cousin\n\nThe idea that \"Contact\" was initially developed, researched, and written by Mike Ockrent's (Stroman's husband) development executive and assistants during his brief production deal at Warner Bros, is more than likely untrue. According to \"Playbill\" in a 1999 article, the musical was inspired by an experience that Stroman had \"... when she visited a dance club in the Meat Market district. There she witnessed a fascinating woman in a yellow dress who took turns dancing with different partners throughout the night. Watching from the sidelines, Stroman thought, 'she's going to change someone's life tonight' .\" \n\nRobin Pogrebin wrote in \"The New York Times\" in 1999 of Stroman visiting a swing club and noticing a dancer in a yellow dress. \"The woman would step up to the dance floor as a song was beginning and nod or shake her head at the various men asking to be her partner. Then, after holding everyone's attention with her nervy grace, she would disappear into the crowd. What came out of this was \"Contact...\" \"\n\nThe same origin was related in an article in \"The New Yorker\", written by John Lahr in 2014: “ 'Into this sea of dark fashion stepped a girl in a yellow dress,' Stroman recalled. 'You couldn’t help but notice her: it was a very bold color to wear at night—lemon yellow—the same color you find on a traffic light. When she wanted to dance, she would step away from the bar and some man would ask her to dance.'\"\n\n\"Contact\" is made up of three separate dance pieces, each set to pre-recorded music, including from Tchaikovsky, Stéphane Grappelli, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Royal Crown Revue, and The Beach Boys. In each story, the central character expresses a longing to make a romantic connection.\n\nAll three stories concern \"contact\", or its lack.\n\n\nSources:Amazon.com;\nInternet Broadway Database\n\n\nSource: Internet Broadway Database\n\n\nMary Ann Lamb (replacement)\n\n\nBen Brantley, in his review in \"The New York Times\" of the production at the Newhouse, wrote: \"...Stroman... aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble of dancing actors and acting dancers, has created the unthinkable: a new musical throbbing with wit, sex appeal and a perfectionist's polish. Brimming with a sophistication that is untainted by the usual fin-de-siecle cynicism, \"Contact\" restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. It's the kinetic equivalent of Rodgers and Hart.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248986", "title": "Trash (video game)", "text": "Trash (video game)\n\nTrash is a real-time strategy computer game developed by Inhuman Games for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was released on September 20, 2005.\n\nThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where, after the great nuclear war of 2015, peace treaties were signed, nuclear weapons were destroyed, and civilization was slowly rebuilt. However, 8 years after treaties were signed, a fleet of alien ships appeared outside Earth's atmosphere. Several super weapons were fired from the largest of the alien spacecraft, the resulting explosions causing major alterations to Earth's geography. Fearing for the lives of every human on earth, the United States Government unleashed its hidden nuclear arsenal on the alien ships. The resulting explosions rained down onto the planet, causing buildings to be destroyed and the air to be poisoned by radiation. As a result, in 10 hours, 5 of the 9 billion humans on Earth were killed.\n\nThe remaining smaller alien ships traveled into Earth's atmosphere, but never landed due to resistance by the remaining humans on earth.\n\nAfter the alien ships left, mutants slowly began to appear, initially doing nothing more than raiding human settlements for building materials and kidnapping humans. As these incidents were few and far between, and by now many people had lost much of their families and other social contacts, most of these went unnoticed.\n\nHowever, the mutants had their own plans. The mutants were hybrids of the aliens that came to conquer Earth. They injected captured humans with their own DNA, causing them to mutate. Eventually, the mutants' forces were strong enough to take on the humans. The mutants deployed their forces, and the war between the humans and mutants began.\n\nTrash consists of two species: Humans and Mutants. A machine race is to be added in a sequel, but for now this has been left out as Inhuman Games is a very small team, and want to focus their efforts on the humans and mutants.\n\nThe gameplay is focused mostly on multiplayer skirmishes. There are now single player campaigns, although they are still in beta mode, and there is an AI for single player skirmishes though it is not highly advanced. One integral feature is that if a human and a mutant are allied then they are able to benefit from each other's technology; something that most games do not allow. This does somewhat contradict the game story, but the story is not a central focus of the gameplay.\n\nThe main resource in the game, used by both races, is trash. Trash is used as a building material for almost every unit in the game. It must be collected by Dump Trucks or Thralls, which are the collection and building units for humans and mutants respectively. Both of these units are collectively referred to as peons.\n\nThere are two other resources in the game, Gas and People. Gas is used as a resource only by humans, while people are as a resource only used by mutants. Gas is gathered by building a refinery on top of a gas site. The refineries in trash, unlike such buildings in other games such as \"StarCraft\", do not require continuous collection. People are acquired from unarmed huts, and must be collected by thralls.\n\nIn addition to that, there are special building sites in the game. Most core buildings can be built without the need of a special site. Such buildings mainly include unit-producing buildings and resource buildings. There are three types of sites in Trash, they are: toxic waste sites, precious metal sites, and gas sites. Every race has upgrades for units or special structures which can only be built on such sites. Destroying a structure built on such a site does not destroy the site however the site can be destroyed by a military unit, unless it is a gas site. Gas sites, however, must be discovered through special detection and are generally rather more scarce than the other sites.\n\nStructures in trash must be connected together by pipe. Pipe is an inexpensive structure that is built together, and forms the basis of logistics in \"Trash\". Unlike other RTS games where resources seem to magically pop from one place to another where needed, in \"Trash\" they must travel through pipe. This also applies to technologies which are researched. Technology can be shared with an allied player by constructing a pipe to link your pipe system with your ally's. If the pipe between two bases of the same player is broken, the two bases become effectively isolated, as a result, the resource indicator is divided into two in order to show readings for each base. Then the player can only use the resources available on one pipe network for building on that network, unless the pipe is rebuilt.\n\nInitially the game was dominated by great players such as XBurguer, TratorzinBR, Arkansas & 7FANG. Later on, players like StrontiumDog, FlameOut and Knallie lifted the game up to a whole new level. The last couple of years were dominated by players such as Amenth/Shady (the first and only player making it to the 'Hall of Fame' twice), DaHOOD and Shadow.\n\nAlthough the game has always had a very close and warm community, the game has barely got any active players during the last couple of years. Many consider the famous '2010' hack, performed by Sebas&Sebas, the main cause for the game's activity going downhill. Important to note is that the game makes a 'summer comeback' every now and then; meaning that a lot of players pop-up to play a couple of games. Often on basis of a Facebook announcement at the official Trash RTS page.\n\nMultiplayer games are organised via a central game lobby, where gamers meet to chat and play games. Unlike most RTS games, \"Trash\" has a client–server architecture for networking, so people behind a firewall can host games. This also dramatically reduces lag, especially if both players are on dial-up.\n\nThe game was given the 2005 Multiplayer Game of the Year award by GameTunnel.\n\n"}

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals (1928, 1930–32, 1941–42), New York Giants (1933–38, 1942–44), Chicago Cubs (1939), Brooklyn Dodgers (1940) and Philadelphia Phillies (1945).\n\nMancuso was known for his capable handling of pitching staffs and for his on-field leadership abilities. He was a member of five National League pennant-winning teams, and played as the catcher for five pitchers who were eventually inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mancuso was regarded as one of the top defensive catchers of the 1930s.\n\nMancuso was born in Galveston, Texas to the son of a Sicilian immigrant and the daughter of German immigrants. His father died in his forties and his mother continued to support the family by working as a midwife. Mancuso first began to play baseball as a nine-year-old. After graduating from high school, he went to work as a teller at a bank although, he was hired more for his talent as a baseball player than as a teller, playing as a member of the bank's baseball team. He eventually caught the attention of the President of the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League, and began his professional baseball career with them in 1925.\n\nIn 1927, he hit for a .372 batting average for the Syracuse Stars in the International League. He made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals at the age of 22 on April 30, 1928, and stayed with them until July, when he was sent to the Minneapolis Millers in the American Association. He spent 1929 with St. Louis's American Association farm club, the Rochester Red Wings and with Houston.\n\nThe Cardinals returned Mancuso to the major leagues in 1930, primarily because of a contract dispute with Branch Rickey that made Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis void Mancuso's minor league contract. He served as a reserve catcher to Jimmie Wilson who Mancuso considered one of the best catchers of the era.\n\nAlthough they competed for the same job, the veteran Wilson provided Mancuso with valuable help in learning the intricacies of catching in the major leagues. Mancuso became a student of the game, learning to study the daily box scores to learn the strengths and weaknesses of opposing teams. On September 12, Wilson sprained his ankle and would not play for the rest of the season. Mancuso rose to the occasion, ending the season with a .366 batting average during a hitters' year when the league average was above .300 for the first and only time.\n\nThe Cardinals won the National League pennant but, eventually lost to Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in the 1930 World Series.\n\nIn 1931 Mancuso was once again the reserve catcher to Wilson, leading the league with a 54.3% caught stealing percentage as the Cardinals won their second consecutive National League pennant.\n\nThe 1931 World Series was a rematch with the Athletics as the Cardinals were victorious in a seven-game series. Mancuso only had one plate appearance during the series as a late-inning pinch hitter. During the 1932 season, Wilson turned 32 years old and shared the catching duties with Mancuso who caught 82 games to Wilson's 75 and hit for a .284 average.\n\nMancuso was traded to the New York Giants before the 1933 season where new manager Bill Terry was rebuilding the team after the resignation of longtime manager John McGraw. Terry wanted to build his team around speed, defense and pitching. He replaced the slow-footed Shanty Hogan and installed the agile Mancuso as the Giants' starting catcher. Terry allowed Mancuso to be in charge of the Giants' pitching staff that included; Carl Hubbell's sharp-breaking screwball, Hal Schumacher's diving sinker ball, Freddie Fitzsimmons' knuckleball and Roy Parmelee who threw a variety of different pitches.\n\nUnder Mancuso's guidance, the Giants' pitching staff led the National League in earned run average as the team won their first pennant in nine years. Although Mancuso led National League catchers in errors and passed balls, he also led in games played, baserunners caught stealing, putouts and, finished second in assists and in range factor. The Giants went on to defeat the Washington Senators in the 1933 World Series. Terry credited Mancuso as a major factor in moving the Giants from sixth place in 1932 to World Series champions in 1933.\n\nIn an Associated Press poll of sportswriters, Mancuso finished second to the Yankees' Bill Dickey as the majors league's all-star catcher based on his ability to handle pitchers so skillfully. Mancuso ranked sixth in voting for the 1933 National League Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn 1934, the Giants finished in second place, two games behind the eventual world champion St. Louis Cardinals, as Mancuso had an off-year with his batting average dropping almost twenty points along with 10 fewer runs batted in.\n\nIn 1935 Mancuso improved to hit for a .298 batting average with five home runs, and 56 runs batted in. He also earned a spot as a reserve for the National League team in the 1935 All-Star Game.\n\nHe had his best season in 1936, hitting for a .301 batting average with career-highs of nine home runs and 63 runs batted in as the Giants once again claimed the National League pennant. He led the league's catchers in putouts, baserunners caught stealing, finished second in assists and, once again guided the Giants' pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league. The Giants would go down in defeat against the powerful New York Yankees in the 1936 World Series. Mancuso finished the year ranked eighth in voting for the 1936 National League Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn 1937, Mancuso was hitting for a .283 average at mid-season to earn his second berth as a reserve for the National League team in the 1937 All-Star Game. A few days after the All-Star Game, a foul tip broke the ring finger on Mancuso's right hand. Harry Danning replaced him and played well enough that, when Mancuso was healthy again, the two shared the catching duties for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Giants clinched their second consecutive National League pennant and, once again faced the New York Yankees in the 1937 World Series. Mancuso started the first two World Series games but, when he went hitless, Danning took over as the Yankees went on to win the series in five games. Danning took over as the Giants' starting catcher for the 1938 season with Mancuso hitting a respectable .348 with a .411 on-base percentage in 52 games.\n\nThe Giants traded Mancuso to the Chicago Cubs before the 1939 season where he shared catching duties with 38-year-old player-manager Gabby Hartnett. He ended the season with a .231 batting average with only two home runs and 17 runs batted in. With the shortage of major league players due to the Second World War, Mancuso saw his career extended for another four years. He played the 1940 season with the Brooklyn Dodgers before the Cardinals brought him back to St. Louis for the 1941 season. Mancuso helped develop the Cardinals' rookie catcher and future star, Walker Cooper but, when Cooper was injured, Mancuso caught the majority of the Cardinals' games in 1941. He was credited with helping the Cardinals to a second-place finish due to his work with rookie pitchers Ernie White (17-7) and Howie Krist (10-0), but only managed to post a .229 batting average.\n\nMancuso returned to the Giants in 1942 as a backup catcher and pitching coach. When Harry Danning was drafted into the United States Army, Mancuso became the club's starting catcher at age 37, sharing the job with 35-year-old future Hall of Fame member, Ernie Lombardi for the 1943 and 1944 seasons.\n\nAt the end of the 1944 season, one month before his 39th birthday, he was released by the Giants. Former teammate Freddie Fitzsimmons was managing the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945 and, convinced Mancuso to play one more season as a catcher and full-time pitching coach. He caught 70 games while sharing catching duties with Andy Seminick but, when Fitzsimmons was fired, Mancuso left the club before the end of the season, playing his final game on September 11 at the age of 40.\n\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Mancuso played in 1,460 games, accumulating 1,194 hits in 4,505 at bats for a .265 career batting average along with 53 home runs, 543 runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .328. He retired with a .977 fielding percentage. A two-time All-Star, he led National League catchers three times in putouts, and twice in baserunners caught stealing and in range factor. His 50.69% career caught stealing percentage ranks 10th all-time among major league catchers. Mancuso was a member of five pennant-winning teams. He caught for five pitchers who were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame (Carl Hubbell, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Dizzy Dean, Burleigh Grimes and Jesse Haines). In his book, \"The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", baseball historian Bill James ranked Mancuso 74th all-time among major league catchers.\n\nIn 1946, Mancuso became the player-manager of the minor league Tulsa Oilers and in 1948 he took over as manager of the San Antonio Missions. In 1950, he was hired as the pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nMancuso began a career as a broadcaster in 1951 with his hometown Houston team in the Texas League. He later moved to St. Louis where he worked with play-by-play announcer Harry Caray on the Cardinals' radio network until 1954. He then served as a scout for the St. Louis Cardinals and the Houston Colt .45s. His younger brother, Frank Mancuso, also was a major league catcher in the mid-1940s. In 1962 Mancuso was seriously injured in a traffic accident which killed his wife, Lorena Mancuso.\n\nMancuso was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1984. Mancuso contracted emphysema and died in 1984 at the age of 78 in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n"}

The railroad's date of organization was March 4, 1853, and construction began that June.\n\nTerrain made the Warren expensive to build, requiring a large amount of excavation, three large bridges, and two tunnels.\n\nDL&W began operating on the railway on May 28, 1856, from Delaware, New Jersey, to Hampton, and continuing over CNJ to Jersey City. DL&W formally leased the Warren Railroad in October 1857.\n\nThe tracks were originally gauge, continuous with the DL&W's Pennsylvania tracks. A third rail was added to CNJ's track.\n\nWhen the railroad opened in 1856, the Van Nest Gap Tunnel was not yet completed, and a temporary track was used. The tunnel was completed in September 1862, and the temporary track removed.\n\nMerger talks between the DL&W and CNJ broke down and on December 10, 1868, the DL&W signed a lease for the Morris & Essex Railroad (M&E), effective January 1, 1869. The DL&W then shifted their mainline off of CNJ to the M&E with a new junction at Washington, New Jersey. While the Warren Railroad was straight from the DL&W's former terminus at the Delaware River to the CNJ, its route to the M&E was circuitous. Additionally, the section between the Washington and Hampton (later called the Hampton Branch) was deemed useless.\n\nThe M&E was originally built to a gauge of , but was converted to in July 1866. After the DL&W lease, a third rail was added for from Washington eastward to Hoboken from 1869-1870. DL&W's tracks from Scranton to Washington were converted to on May 27, 1876. The unused third rail on the M&E was subsequently removed.\n\nThe Lackawanna Cut-Off was built to minimize grades and curves, and to avoid the operational problems of the Warren Railroad. The Cut-Off was completed in 1911, becoming the new mainline of the DL&W. This relegated the Warren Railroad and the M&E line west of Port Morris Junction to a branch line known as the Lackawanna Old Road, starting the railroad's decline.\n\nIn 1945, DL&W officially bought the Warren Railroad. In 1955 revenue freight service ended on the Hampton Branch; the last train to operate on the line was a work train in 1956. The line was officially abandoned in 1958. The grand Changewater truss bridge and Route 31 bridge in Hampton were removed in April 1959. Trackage remained intact until 1963 when Erie Lackawanna removed all of it. \n\nHurricane Diane caused extensive damage to the line at Delaware and Manunka Chunk in 1955. The PRR junction was soon abandoned. The Old Road Branch was then single tracked from Washington to Delaware. \n\nStorm damage in 1968 near Oxford, New Jersey, led to the railroad's demise. All remaining trackage was removed by April 1970 between Washington and Delaware. Track remained in Delaware for some time after the line south to Washington was torn up because it was needed for coal train back ups from the Portland power plant. Track was later shortened to the truss bridge over the Delaware River by 1980. Until recently coal trains still backed out on the truss bridge.\n\nTwo connections from other railroads were made to the Warren Railroad.\n\nThe Blairstown Railway opened in 1877, from a connection to the Warren Railroad in Delaware to Blairstown. While the Blairstown Railway was a partial thoroughfare for the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad and the Lehigh & New England Railroad, the section from Delaware to Hainesburg was just a vestigial branch line known as the Delaware Branch, which was abandoned in 1928.\n\nThe Belvidere Delaware Railroad (Bel Del) was extended north from Belvidere, New Jersey, to form a junction with the Warren Railroad at Manunka Chunk, which opened on May 16, 1864. The Pennsylvania Railroad operated to East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, via trackage rights. Passenger service ceased in 1953, and the tracks north of Belvidere to the junction were washed out by Hurricane Diane in 1955.\n\nThe Lehigh and Hudson River Railway crossed beneath the Warren Railroad south of Bridgeville, without an interchange.\n\n"}

It was so faint that it had already passed perihelion about a month before its discovery, and only a close pass by the Earth had made it bright enough for discovery. Otto Wilhelm von Struve reported that the comet was visible to the naked eye at the end of November. It remained visible for smaller telescopes until 10 January 1844 and was finally lost to larger telescopes on 10 April 1844.\n\nIn 1844, Thomas James Henderson computed that the comet was a short period comet; by May, its period had been calculated to be 7.43 years. Urbain Le Verrier computed the positions for the 1851 apparition, predicting perihelion in April 1851. The comet was found close to his predicted position on 28 November 1850 by James Challis.\n\nThe comet was missed during its apparitions in 1903 and 1918 due to unfavorable observing circumstances.

{"id": "2249053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249053", "title": "Rumble (noise)", "text": "Rumble (noise)\n\nA rumble is a continuous deep, resonant sound, such as the sound made by heavy vehicles or thunder. In the context of audio reproduction rumble refers to a low frequency sound from the bearings inside a turntable. This is most noticeable in low quality turntables with ball bearings. Higher quality turntables use slide bearings, minimizing rumble.\n\nSome phono pre-amplifiers implement a rumble filter, in an attempt to remove the noise. A heavier platter can also help dampen this.\n\nRumble measurement is carried out on turntables (for vinyl recordings) which tend to generate very low frequency noise originating from the centre bearing and from drive pulleys or belts, as well as from irregularities in the record disc itself.\n\nIt can be heard as low-frequency noise and becomes a serious problem when playing records on audio systems with a good low-frequency response. Even when not audible, rumble can cause intermodulation, modulating of the amplitude of other frequencies. The ‘unweighted’ response curve is intended for use in assessing the level of inaudible rumble with such intermodulation in mind.\n\nOne way to reduce rumble is to make the turntable very heavy, so that it acts as mechanical damper or low-pass filter, but even with the best turntables a lot of rumble tends to be generated by warped records or pressing irregularities sometimes visible as ‘bobbles’ in the surface. An important factor affecting rumble is low-frequency resonance resulting from pickup arm mass bouncing against stylus compliance. This resonance is usually in the 10–30 Hz region, and will increase rumble as well as reducing tracking ability if not well-damped. Some pickup arms incorporate viscous damping aimed at eliminating such resonance.\n\nBecause these effects generate a mostly vertical component at the stylus, which corresponds to a difference signal in stereo reproduction, the incorporation of a high-pass filter operating only on the channel difference can be very effective in reducing rumble without loss of bass. Such a filter merges the two channels to mono at very low frequencies, which is not generally considered to have any effect on stereo perception, though it can change the sound balance (often for the better) by altering the way in which resonant room modes are stimulated (reducing corner to corner stimulation). The original circuit was designed in 1978 by Jeff Macaulay and featured as a circuit idea in \"Wireless World\". Most so-called rumble filters work by simply rolling off the low-frequency response, which is detrimental to sound quality.\n\nThough several standards exist that define how rumble should be measured, they all have a common basis, and use the weighting curves shown here.\nDIN 45539 (1971) and IEC98-1964 both cover rumble measurement.\nBS4852: Part 1 (1972) is specific in requiring that a slow rectifier be used, which shall reach 99% of its steady indication in 5s +-0.5s with not more than 10% overshoot.\n\n"}

It is found from Ontario, Minnesota, and Vermont south to southern Florida, and west as far as southeastern South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas. There have been reports of isolated populations (very likely naturalized) in New Mexico, Idaho, and British Columbia.\n\nCommon in the United States, it is listed as an endangered species in Canada, and is susceptible to hybridization with the invasive white mulberry (\"M. alba\"), introduced from Asia.\n\nRed mulberry is a deciduous tree, growing to tall, rarely , with a trunk up to in diameter. It is a small to medium-sized tree that reaches a height of 70 feet and lives up to 125 years. \n\nThe leaves are alternate, long (rarely to ) and broad (about twice as big as the white mulberry's leaves), simple, broadly cordate, with a shallow notch at the base, typically unlobed on mature trees although often with 2-3 lobes, particularly on young trees, and with a finely serrated margin. Unlike the leaves of white mulberry (\"M. alba\") which have a lustrous upper surface, the red mulberry leaf upper surface is noticeably rough, similar in texture to fine sandpaper, and the underside is densely covered with soft hairs. The leaf petiole exudes milky sap when severed. The leaves turn yellow in Autumn. Red mulberry is hardy to subzero temperatures, relatively hardy to drought, pollution, and poor soil, though the white mulberry is hardier.\n\nThe flowers are relatively inconspicuous: small, yellowish green or reddish green and opening as leaves emerge. Male and female flowers are usually on separate trees although they may occur on the same tree.\n\nThe fruit is a compound cluster of several small achenes surrounded by a fleshy calyx, similar in appearance to a blackberry, long. It is initially pale green, ripening to red or dark purple.\nThe berries are widely sought after by birds in spring and early summer in North America; as many as 31 species of birds have been recorded visiting a fruiting tree in Arkansas.\n\nThe berries are edible and very sweet.\nThe first English colonists to explore eastern Virginia in 1607 mentioned the abundance of both mulberry trees and their fruit, which was eaten (sometimes boiled) by the native Powhatan tribes.\nToday, mulberries are eaten raw, used in the fillings of pastries, and fermented into wine.\n\nThe wood may be dried and used for smoking meats with a flavor that is mild and sweet.\nChoctaw people wove clothing from the inner bark of young \"Morus rubra\" and similar shoots.\n"}

In the U.S. Navy, this school was previously under the auspices of Naval Aviation Schools Command at NAS Pensacola, Florida. It is now known as the LDO/CWO Academy under the auspices of Officer Training Command at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nLDOs perform similar tasks as those of warrant officer (WO), but the formal definition differences are subtle and focus on the degree of authority and level of responsibility, as well as the breadth of required expertise. The term \"limited duty\" refers not to an LDO's authority, but rather the LDO's career progression and restrictions. Historically an LDO, prior to World War II, could only advance as far as lieutenant (O-3E) in the Navy and captain (O-3E) in the Marine Corps. In later years, an LDO could be promoted to commander (O-5) and, in the Marine Corps, the senior LDO rank remains lieutenant colonel (O-5). In the 1990s, the ceiling in most U.S. Navy LDO communities was raised to captain (O-6).\n\nThe LDO/CWO motto is \"\"sursum ab ordine\"\" which means \"up from the ranks\" to underline a distinction between LDOs and CWOs and those Naval and Marine Corps officers commissioned directly from collegiate programs such as the United States Naval Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, Naval ROTC and Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class, and similar post-collegiate pre-commissioning officer candidate programs of the Navy and Marine Corps such as Officer Candidate School and the since-disestablished Aviation Officer Candidate School.\n\nUnlike their unrestricted line officer (URL) brethren, most LDOs in the U.S. Navy cannot aspire to command a major warship, combat aviation squadron, or auxiliary vessel, although for a select few in the right communities, command is now a possibility, particularly command of shore installations and technical training schools. In the U.S. Marine Corps, some military occupational specialties (MOS) permit LDOs to be commanding officers. Many LDOs have qualified for command ashore of certain shore activities, ranging from activities such as small to medium-size Navy Operational Support Centers (formerly \"Naval Reserve Centers\") and Naval Support Activities at the lieutenant commander and commander level, to large activities such as the Naval Air Technical Training Center at the captain level. In other words, LDOs may succeed to command activities which have a primary function corresponding to the Navy officer designator or Marine Corps MOS of the officer concerned.\n\nLDOs are experts and leaders in the Navy enlisted rating or Marine Corps enlisted MOS from which they came. LDOs are considered more the officer and less the technician than the chief warrant officer (CWO). LDOs will only be assigned to billets that are in their designator or MOS and that are designated as LDO billets. LDOs may not be assigned to billets designated for U.S. Navy unrestricted line officers or their U.S. Marine Corps counterparts. This does not preclude an LDO from being assigned additional duties as deemed appropriate, including Joint duty.\n\nIn the U.S. Marine Corps, CWOs must serve a minimum of 8 years from the day they were initially promoted to WO in order to be eligible for the LDO program. Applicants must have less than 20 years of active duty service in order to be eligible for the LDO program. When selected, the Marine is appointed a Captain (O-3E). Appointment to LDO also requires the completion of 10 years of commissioned service before being eligible for retirement. This program is managed within the Recruiting Command because it is not a promotion board, but rather an accession board.\n\nIn the U.S. Navy, LDOs and CWOs are former enlisted technicians (petty officers 1st class or chief petty officers for LDO and chief petty officer for CWO). They are experts and leaders in the technical specialty enlisted rates from which they came. In the Navy, first class petty officers (E-6) eligible for promotion to chief petty officer, and chief petty officers (E-7) and senior chief petty officers (E-8) with more than 8 but less than 14 years of service are eligible for the LDO program, while chief petty officers with 14-20 years of service, senior chief petty officers, and master chief petty officers are usually selected for the CWO program. However, CWOs can, and do, move into the LDO program, but do so as a lieutenant junior grade (O-2E).\n\n"}

Elliott\n\nEliot Valens Elliott, also known as Vic Elliott, (12 September 1902 – 26 November 1984) was a trade union leader of the Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA) from 1941 to 1978.\n\nBorn in Huntly, New Zealand, Elliott left school at the age of 15, briefly worked on the New Zealand railways, before becoming a merchant seaman and travelling the world.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Elliott moved to Australia to live and work as a seafarer. He was a shipboard delegate during the Seamen's Strike of 1925, which severely disrupted trade between Britain, South Africa and Australasia. By 1935 Elliott had become recognised as a leader of Australian seamen and was prominent in a bitter strike against an unsatisfactory Award and poor working conditions that lasted from December 1935 to February 1936. The strike failed with the union left divided and crippled. Recognised by his peers as a skilled and militant trade unionist, he was elected leader of the Queensland Branch of the Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA) in 1936 and also joined the Communist Party of Australia that year. In 1941, he was elected Federal Secretary of the union, a position he was to hold continually until his retirement in 1978.\n\nUnder Elliot's leadership, the SUA contributed significantly to the war effort during World War II, and over the years, the harsh and dangerous working conditions of rank and file Australian seamen greatly improved. Elliott adopted a policy of as much face-to-face contact with the rank and file as possible and established a journal, \"The Seamen's Voice\", which allowed for significant debate and contributions from members and emphasised the importance of unity, solidarity and internationalism among seamen and maritime workers.\n\nIn recognition of his organisational capabilities, in 1949, he was elected Vice President of the Seamen's and Dockers Trade Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions, with Australian-born American longshoreman Harry Bridges elected President.\n\nElliott supported the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and he was a founding member of the Socialist Party of Australia in 1971. While many labelled him a \"Stalinist\", he was a dynamic leader of the Seamen's Union, who used every opportunity to advance the interests of his members including strong advocacy for the Australian merchant fleet.\n\nWith the advancement of shipbuilding in the 1960s and containerisation, Elliott and the union's policy making body, the National Committee of Management (COM), met over four days in June 1968 and hammered out a historic document formulating the union's attitude to technological change on the basis of social progress that was subsequently unanimously adopted at meetings of seamen around Australia. Over the next 20 years, a substantial amount of this policy of fundamental improvement of working conditions was achieved. Elliott said in 1968 that seamen had \"to take advantage of technological developments\" and that \"the future belongs to us if we learn how to grasp and hold it\". He explained, \"We believe men are more important than machines and new ships.\"\n\nThe \"Seamens' Union of Australia\", which amalgamated with the \"Waterside Workers Federation\" in 1993 to form the Maritime Union of Australia, was also renowned in the Australian labour movement for its involvement nationally and internationally in political issues like the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and in protests against the Vietnam War, motivated by the necessity of social progress in work and society on a national and international scale.\n\nSome of the ashes of Elliott were scattered on the sea south east of Sydney Heads at a mariner's funeral service held on the morning of 12 April 1985.\n\n"}

In 1947 he was among the founding members of the Forma 1 group of artists, who advocated both Marxism and structured abstraction.\n\nConsagra was born on 6 October 1920 in Mazara del Vallo, in the province of Trapani in south-western Sicily, to Luigi Consagra and Maria Lentini. From 1931 he enrolled in a trade school for sailors, studying first to become a mechanic, and later to become a captain. In 1938 he moved to Palermo, where he enrolled in the \"liceo artistico\"; despite an attack of tuberculosis, he graduated in 1941, and in the same year signed up at the Accademia di Belle Arti, where he studied sculpture under . After the Invasion of Sicily and the Allied occupation of Palermo in 1943, Consagra found work as a caricaturist for the American Red Cross club of the city; he also joined the Italian Communist Party. Early in 1944, armed with a letter of introduction from an American officer, he travelled to Rome. There he came into contact with the Sicilian artist , and through him with Renato Guttuso, who was also Sicilian and who introduced him to the intellectual life of the city and to other artists such as Leoncillo Leonardi, Mario Mafai and Giulio Turcato. Consagra signed up at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma in September 1944 and studied sculpture there under , but left before completing his diploma.\n\nIn 1947, with Carla Accardi, Ugo Attardi, Piero Dorazio, Mino Guerrini, , and Giulio Turcato, Consagra started the artist's group Forma 1, which advocated both Marxism and structured abstraction.\n\nSteadily Consagra's work began to find an audience. Working primarily in metal, and later in marble and wood, his thin, roughly carved reliefs, began to be collected by Peggy Guggenheim and other important patrons of the arts. He showed at the Venice Biennale eleven times between 1950 and 1993, and in 1960 won the sculpture prize at the exhibition.\n\nDuring the 1960s he was associated with the \"Continuità\" group, an offshoot of Forma I, and in 1967 taught at the School of Arts in Minneapolis. Large commissions allowed him to begin working on a more monumental scale, and works of his were installed in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry in Rome and in the European Parliament, Strasbourg. His work is found in the collections of The Tate Gallery, London, in Museo Cantonale d'Arte of Lugano and the Museum of Modern Art, Paris, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..\n\nConsagra returned to Sicily where he sculpted a number of significant works during the 1980s. With Senator Ludovico Corrao, he helped created an open-air museum in the new town of Gibellina, after the older town had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1968. Consagra designed the gates to the town's entrance, the building named \"Meeting\" and the gates to the cemetery, where he was later buried.\n\nIn 1952 Consagra published \"La necessità della scultura\" (\"the need for sculpture\"), a response to the essay \"La scultura lingua morta\" (\"sculpture, a dead language\"), published in 1945 by Arturo Martini. Other works include \"L'agguato c'è\" (\"the snare exists\", 1960), and \"La città frontale\" (\"the frontal city\", 1969). His autobiography, \"Vita Mia\", was published by Feltrinelli in 1980.\n\nIn 1989 a substantial retrospective exhibition of work by Consagra was shown at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome; in 1993 a permanent exhibition of his work was installed there. In 1991 his work was shown in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. In 2002 the Galerie der Stadt Stuttgart opened a permanent exhibition of his work.\n"}

The show premiered on September 27, 1996, on ABC to over 17 million viewers in its \"T.G.I.F.\" line-up.\n\nThe show stars Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman, an American teenager who, on her sixteenth birthday, discovers she has magical powers (a departure from the \"Archie Comics\", where she has known of her magic powers since an early age as revealed in the \"Sabrina – That Cute Little Witch\" storylines in many \"Little Archie\" comic books). She lives with her 600-year-old aunts, witches Hilda (played by Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (played by Beth Broderick), and their magical talking cat, Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay), at 133 Collins Road, in the fictional Boston suburb of Westbridge, Massachusetts through most of the series.\n\nThe series' first four seasons aired on ABC from September 27, 1996, to May 5, 2000; the final three seasons ran on The WB from September 22, 2000, to April 24, 2003.\n\nThe unofficial pilot of the series was the 1996 TV movie \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" in April. The movie, produced by Viacom and Hartbreak Films and aired on Showtime, starred Melissa Joan Hart as the title character, Sabrina Sawyer, and Charlene Fernetz and Sherry Miller as Sabrina's aunts Zelda and Hilda, respectively. When the television series debuted on ABC later that year, Hart became Sabrina Spellman, and Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick replaced Fernetz and Miller. In 2000, the show was dropped by ABC and picked up by The WB. When viewership began to wane, the show was canceled after seven seasons.\n\nThe television series was produced by Hartbreak Films and Viacom Productions with Finishing the Hat Productions being there for season 1 only. Later it was syndicated through Paramount Domestic Television on reruns. Paramount Network Television absorbed Viacom Productions in 2004, and two years later, Paramount's TV operations were renamed to CBS Paramount Television (now CBS Television Studios), whose name is seen on the season 1, 2, and 3 DVDs. Then in 2007, the syndication arm was renamed from CBS Paramount Domestic Television to CBS Television Distribution, whose name is on the season 4, 5, 6, and 7 DVDs. The official copyright holder for the series (as with all series originally produced by Viacom Productions) is CBS Studios Productions, LLC.\n\nThe opening titles of the first three seasons shows Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with four different costumes and outfits as the cast members' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen. The first three outfits are always the same, but the fourth one changes from episode to episode. At the end, Sabrina would say something that is related to the last costume (often a pun or a joke related to the costume or the content of the episode), and then magically disappear from head on down.\n\nThe opening sequence for the fourth season is completely redone, featuring a completely new theme and the show's main characters, starting with Sabrina, floating in bubbles while their names are displayed in gold letters and a voice chants \"Secret\" in the background.\n\nThe opening credits for the final three seasons are accompanied by a new vocal theme song and feature Sabrina at various locations around Boston: Harvard Bridge, Boston Common, Union Oyster House, Massachusetts State House, Quincy Market, Newbury Street, Harvard University, Tufts University, and Beacon Hill. In the credits of seasons five and six, after leaving Newbury Comics on Newbury Street, Sabrina walks down a flight of stairs and computer graphics morph Sabrina into her room, lying on her bed next to Salem. In the final season, however, the computer graphics morph Sabrina arriving at \"Scorch\". Upon pushing the door open, she is revealed to be walking into her house to greet Roxie, Morgan, and Salem.\n\nThe actual house photographed and filmed to depict Spellman Manor is a Victorian mansion located at 64 E. Main St. in Freehold, New Jersey. The exteriors for Westbridge High School, which Sabrina attended, were Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nThe show went through many cast changes, the first major change being the unexplained departure of Sabrina's best friend Jenny Kelly (Michelle Beaudoin) at the end of the first season.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth season, Valerie departs the show permanently along with Libby. Valerie's character moves away to Alaska with her family, while Libby transfers to a boarding school.\n\nWhen the series finished its fourth season, several secondary characters left the show, including Martin Mull and Nate Richert. Richert, who played Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey since the first season, was cut in order to give the show a more \"grown-up look\" as Sabrina was about to attend college. The decision was later rescinded, and Richert appeared in three episodes of season five and then returned as a series regular in season six and seven.\n\nAfter the series' sixth season, Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick, who portrayed Sabrina's aunts from the show's premiere, decided to leave the show. When the character of Sabrina started to attend college, the role of her aunts became less important. Broderick felt that the role of Zelda had nothing more to offer, while Rhea landed her own syndicated talk show, \"The Caroline Rhea Show\".\n\nTrevor Lissauer, who played Sabrina's housemate Miles, left the show after appearing in seasons five and six. Producers felt that his character wasn't well received by fans and also had to make some budget cuts for the show's seventh and final season. Miles was never properly written out, leaving open what really happened to him.\n\nSabrina's love interest Josh, played by David Lascher, left for Prague after appearing from seasons four to six. Lascher reportedly wanted to pursue other projects. In order to fill the void, producers brought in Aaron, played by Dylan Neal, as Sabrina's love interest in the show's final season.\n\nThe show chronicles the adventures of Sabrina Spellman (played by Melissa Joan Hart), a girl who discovers on her sixteenth birthday that she is a witch. As a novice witch, her spells often go awry. Her aunts Hilda and Zelda Spellman (played by Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick, respectively, until 2002) counsel her on the proper use of her magic and give her moral advice. Additionally, Hilda and Zelda must take care of Salem Saberhagen (voiced by Nick Bakay), a witch, turned into a cat for trying to take over the world. \"Sabrina\"'s basic premise and \"genial loopiness\" earned the show comparisons to the 1960s television series \"Bewitched\".\n\nThe show included contemporary pop cultural references, with Sabrina often saying she liked Britney Spears and No Doubt. It also mentioned human history alongside witches, such as the Salem witch hunt, which Zelda tells Sabrina was not a hunt for real witches. Hilda mentions to Sabrina in Episode 1 that \"For two months a bunny ruled all of England\" causing the witches council to turn back time, as if to say mortals are ignorant at the most. One episode also suggests that Jerry Springer is a witch when he hosts \"The Jerry Springer Show\" in the other realm.\n\nWhereas the comic book series was set in the fictional Greendale, the TV show was set in the fictional Boston suburb of Westbridge, Massachusetts.\n\nUltimately, the show covered a span of seven years over seven seasons, though each season was not a year.\n\nThe pilot episode opens with Sabrina asleep on her 16th birthday, levitating above her bed. In the morning, her aunts reveal to her that she is a witch, but Sabrina does not believe them until she has a magical talk with her father from inside a book, where her father reveals that he is a witch and her mother is mortal. It is also revealed that Sabrina cannot see her mother, who is in Peru for two years, or her mother will be transformed into a ball of wax. After a rough day at school, Sabrina accidentally turns Libby Chessler, the most popular girl in school, into a pineapple. Fearing that she will appear \"weird\" to her crush, Harvey Kinkle, Sabrina asks the Witches Council to let her relive that day. The first season follows Sabrina as she tries to keep the balance between being a teenager and having magical powers. Sabrina's friend Jenny Kelley and her teacher, Mr. Pool, both exit the series without explanation after this season.\n\nAt the beginning of the second season, Sabrina turns seventeen and learns that she must earn her witch's license or otherwise lose her magic. However, she neglects her aunts' warnings to study for the test to obtain the license and consequently fails it. She then has to attend witch boot camp to earn the chance to take a makeup test. She passes the makeup test, but only receives a learner's permit. Her aunts explain that she will be able to earn her license when she turns eighteen (\"when she can pay for the insurance\") and that she will be tested throughout the year by a Quizmaster, a witch whose job is to instruct witches earning their licenses. Also introduced during the second season are Sabrina's neurotic friend Valerie and the new school vice principal Mr. Kraft, who finds Sabrina to be very odd and has a crush on Hilda.\n\nAt the beginning of the third season, Sabrina earns her license, but then learns that in order to use her license, she must solve her family's secret. Throughout the season, family members visit her and provide clues. At the end of the season, she solves the family secret (\"Every member of the Spellman family is born with a twin\"). Both Valerie and Libby exit the series after the end of the third season.\n\nAt the beginning of the fourth season, Sabrina is assigned to be a mentor, which is like a Quizmaster, except \"Quizmasters get paid\". Sabrina's charge is Dreama, a witch newly immigrated from the Other Realm. A new student, Brad Alcero, who is also Harvey's best friend, transfers to Sabrina's school. Because Brad has a witch-hunter gene (which allows him to turn a witch into a mouse if the witch reveals his/her magic), Sabrina must keep herself and Dreama from using magic in front of Brad. Also, Sabrina begins working at Bean There, Brewed That, a coffee shop, where she meets and is attracted to Josh (played by David Lascher), a college student who is the manager of the shop, which leads to her kissing him and thus cheating on Harvey, who ends their relationship, but they soon get back together. Both Dreama and Brad are written out of the series without explanation over the course of the season. At the end of the season, Harvey reaches his \"spell quota\" (meaning that no spells can be used on him anymore) and discovers that Sabrina is a witch, and later breaks up with Sabrina off screen and is written out of the show prior to the start of the next season.\n\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, Sabrina starts college at Adams College and moves out of her aunts' house and into a house with other students at Adams. Her roommates are Morgan Cavanaugh, a shallow girl (played by Elisa Donovan); Roxie King (played by Soleil Moon Frye), a social feminist; and Miles Goodman (played by Trevor Lissauer), a geek who is obsessed with science fiction and the paranormal. Hilda and Zelda, feeling lonely since Sabrina moved out, find ways to stay close to her. Hilda buys the coffee shop where Sabrina works and Zelda becomes a professor at Adams and starts dating Sabrina's English professor. The season ends with Sabrina and Josh giving into their feelings and sharing a passionate kiss.\n\nAt the beginning of the sixth season Josh and Sabrina get together but soon face a tough decision when Josh is tempted to move abroad to work as a photographer. Things are made even more complicated between them when Sabrina's ex-boyfriend from high school, Harvey, reappears, this time dating Sabrina's roommate Morgan. At the end of the sixth season, Sabrina agrees to sacrifice true love in order to save Hilda after the latter literally falls to pieces after Sabrina sabotages her relationship. Hilda recovers and is married, but Sabrina then falls to pieces when Josh, Harvey, and an attractive waiter announce they are all moving away and will never see her again.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh and final season, Sabrina is put back together after her Aunt Zelda sacrifices her adult years to save Sabrina. At this point, Zelda, Hilda, Miles, and Josh are written out of the show and Morgan and Roxie move into Hilda and Zelda's old house. Sabrina gets a job as a writer for the entertainment magazine \"Scorch\", but this storyline and all the associated characters are dropped midway through the season. Sabrina then meets Aaron, the man to whom she becomes engaged. In the series finale Sabrina calls off her wedding with Aaron and runs off with Harvey, her soul mate, at 12:36, which is the time of day they first met and is a plot point in the season one episode \"As Westbridge Turns\". In the last scene of the series, Sabrina and Harvey ride off on his motorcycle to the song ‘Running’ by No Doubt, Sabrina's favorite band.\n\nDuring its four-year run on ABC, \"Sabrina\" was the highest-rated series among the network's TGIF line-up. In the 2000–2001 season, the show moved to The WB after a negotiation dispute with ABC. While ABC was willing to renew the show for a fifth season, the network was not willing to pay the reported $1.5 million per episode that Viacom Productions, which produced the show, wanted. The WB then picked up the show for a mere $675,000 per episode, but agreed to commit to 66 episodes.\n\nWhen The WB network picked up the series after ABC canceled it, local stations (usually WB or UPN affiliates, with a couple of \"Big 4\" network affiliates as well) also picked up the rights to air reruns.\n\nThe series formerly aired reruns on ABC Family, Nick at Nite, TeenNick, MTV2, Hub Network, and Logo TV. It currently airs on Antenna TV and is available for streaming on Hulu and Amazon Prime.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Sabrina\" previously aired on ITV and Nickelodeon. It began airing on Pop Girl, a free-to-air children's channel, in July 2012, which previously broadcast the first two seasons and the two subsequent movies before shutting down in October 2015.

{"id": "2249253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249253", "title": "Cavalry in the American Civil War", "text": "Cavalry in the American Civil War\n\n\"'The American Civil War\"... ' saw cavalry tactics move largely away from the offensive towards the defensive, with the emphasis on screening, reconnaissance, raiding and harassment. Development of the rifled musket had also rendered the cavalry charge impractical.\n\nIn the first half of the war, the Confederates enjoyed the advantage in cavalry, as southern men were more accustomed to the riding and shooting life, and most of the experienced cavalry officers from the regular army had chosen to side with the Confederacy.\n\nBy the second half, from 1863 onward, the Union Army had gained an equal cavalry capability, through Benjamin Grierson's brilliant deception tactics in the Mississippi valley, and Philip Sheridan's aggressive movements, while in command of the Army of the Shenandoah at the end of the war in Virginia.\n\nCavalry units proved highly expensive to maintain, and unscrupulous agents would often exploit shortages by supplying defective animals at exorbitant prices.\n\nThere were four types of mounted forces prevalent in the Civil War.\n\n\nAt the time of the Civil War, the cavalry had five major missions, in rough priority:\n\n\nThis represented a change from previous eras, in which offensive action was the primary mission. In the Napoleonic Wars, for instance, there were instances of massive cavalry charges used for tactical envelopments of infantry formations. The technology of the rifled musket, which emerged in the 1850s, put an effective end to this practice. While swiftly moving cavalry could overwhelm infantry whose weapons fired accurately only 100 yards, the infantryman with a rifled musket (accurate to 300 yards or more) could fire multiple rounds in the time it took the cavalry to reach his position. A horse and rider were easy targets for these shots.\n\nOffensive actions were certainly not unknown, however, but they were more frequently employed against enemy cavalry than against infantry. Examples of offensive actions include the Battle of Brandy Station and the Battle of Yellow Tavern; cavalry versus cavalry examples include the First Battle of Bull Run and Elon J. Farnsworth's ill-fated charge on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nReconnaissance was the key to effective cavalry, as it remains today in modern armies (although modern cavalrymen use light armored vehicles or helicopters instead of horses). The cavalry serves as the \"eyes\" of the army. Reconnaissance was a crucial component in the Gettysburg Campaign, where cavalry under Union General Alfred Pleasonton attempted to find the wide-ranging Army of Northern Virginia on its invasion of the North, and Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart effectively employed counter-reconnaissance to screen passes in the Blue Ridge Mountains and hide Robert E. Lee's movements.\n\nLong-distance raids were the most desirable mission for cavalrymen, primarily because of the fame that successful raids would bring, but they were often of little practical strategic value. Jeb Stuart became famous for two audacious raids on the Union Army of the Potomac in 1862; in his third such attempt, during the Gettysburg Campaign, he squandered much of the cavalry forces of the Army of Northern Virginia and deprived Robert E. Lee of adequate reconnaissance at the beginning of the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the principal reasons for the Confederate defeat there. Union attempts at strategic raids had mixed success. George Stoneman's raid in the Battle of Chancellorsville was a failure; Benjamin Grierson's raid in the Vicksburg Campaign was a strategic masterpiece that diverted critical Confederate forces away from Ulysses S. Grant's army; James H. Wilson's massive 1865 raid in Alabama foreshadowed the armored warfare maneuvers of World War II. In general, strategic raids were used more effectively in the Western Theater of the war.\n\nDefensive actions by the cavalry were critical in the retreat from Gettysburg. Pursuit and harassment of enemy forces were often neglected (particularly by the Union after Gettysburg and Antietam), but can be seen in their finest form in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee during the Appomattox Campaign.\n\nUntil the nomenclature changed in the early 1880s, cavalry regiments were organized into companies (later, \"troops\") authorized at up to 100 men, ten companies made up a regiment (increased to twelve post-war). Two or more companies might be organized into ad hoc battalions (later, \"squadrons\"), two \"wings\" of six companies each was used through the Indian Wars. Civil War regiments were rarely near authorized strength so that they were commonly brigaded with two to four other regiments. Two to four brigades were combined into divisions. By the end of the war, 272 cavalry regiments were formed in the Union Army and 137 in the Confederate Army.\n\nEarly in the war, most cavalry regiments were dispersed to be under the command of infantry formations, such as divisions or corps. As commanders realized the importance of long-range reconnaissance and raiding, the organizations changed to consolidate more of the regiments into larger units controlled separately. Eventually the Union Army of the Potomac included a Cavalry Corps, which had three divisions. The Army of Northern Virginia, earlier to consolidate under J.E.B. Stuart, organized its force as a cavalry division.\n\nIn both armies, the cavalry was accompanied by batteries or battalions of horse artillery, as well as its own train of ammunition and supply wagons.\n\nThe principal item of equipment for a cavalryman was the horse and one of the reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster-issued animals obtained through public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory.\n\nUnion army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed.\n\nCavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed.\n\nOn both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.\n\nHorses gave the cavalry forces significant mobility. In some operations, forces were pushed to the limit (such as Jeb Stuart's raid on Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in 1862, where his troopers marched 80 miles (130 km) in 27 hours). Such excesses were extremely damaging to the readiness of the units and extensive recovery periods were required. Stuart, during the Gettysburg Campaign the following year, resorted to procuring replacement horses from local farmers and townspeople during his grueling trek northward around the Union army. In York County, Pennsylvania, following the Battle of Hanover, his men appropriated well over 1,000 horses from the region. Many of these untrained new mounts proved a hindrance during the subsequent fighting at East Cavalry Field during the battle of Gettysburg.\n\nSome mounted forces used traditional infantry rifles. However, cavalrymen, particularly in the North, were frequently armed with three other weapons:\n\n\n\n\nA Southerner was, on average, considered a superior horseman to his Northern counterpart, especially early in the war. Roads in the rural South were generally poor, and horses were used more for individual transportation than they were for the carriages and streetcars of the urbanized North, where many of the early Federal cavalry regiments were formed. Furthermore, Southern society was more stratified, which made the soldiers more accustomed to a hierarchy of command and were generally considered more suited to the martial lifestyle. Additionally, the strong militia tradition in the antebellum South and the requirements for local 'slave catcher' patrols led to the development of mounted units prior to 1861.\n\nConfederate soldiers owned their horses and were compensated on a monthly basis. If a soldier's horse was sick, injured, or killed, the soldier was responsible for returning home and replacing the horse at his own expense. The general rule was that the soldier had 60 days to return with a new horse or he was forced to become an infantryman, which was considered to be an ignominious fate.\n\nThe first prominent Confederate cavalry leader was J.E.B. Stuart, who achieved success in the First Battle of Bull Run against infantry. He was a flamboyant dresser and an audacious commander, wildly popular with the Southern public for his escapades in twice encircling the Army of the Potomac. These long-range reconnaissance missions accomplished little of military value but boosted Southern morale. After Stuart's death in 1864, he was replaced by Wade Hampton, who was a more mature, and arguably more effective, commander. Another Eastern commander of note was Turner Ashby, the \"Black Knight of the Confederacy\", who commanded Stonewall Jackson's cavalry forces in the Valley Campaign; he was killed in battle in 1862.\n\nIn the Western Theater, the most fearless, and ruthless, cavalry commander was Nathan Bedford Forrest, who achieved spectacular results with small forces but was an ineffective subordinate to the army commanders he was supposed to support, resulting in poorly coordinated battles. Much of the same issues could be said of Forrest's counterpart in the Army of Tennessee, John Hunt Morgan. In the Eastern Theater, the Partisan Ranger John Singleton Mosby succeeded in tying down upwards of 40,000 Federal troops defending rail lines and logistical hubs with only 100-150 irregulars. In the Trans-Mississippi Theater, John S. Marmaduke and \"Jo\" Shelby became prominent.\n\nThe Union started the war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was initially reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could take as long as two years, and the conventional wisdom that the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being so different from that of Western Europe, would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.\n\nThe Union cavalry was disadvantaged at the start of the war because Northern soldiers allegedly had less comparative equestrian experience than their Southern counterparts, and the Union army did not institute an examination in basic horsemanship before a recruit was mustered into service until August 1862. In addition, over half (104 out of 176) of the experienced U.S. Army cavalry officers had resigned their commissions to fight for the Confederacy. One advantage the Union horseman had over his opponent was the centralized horse procurement organization of the army, relieving him of any responsibility for replacing an injured horse. Commanders often tried to procure specific breeds for their men, with the Morgan being a particular favorite within the Army of the Potomac. Famous Morgan cavalry mounts from the Civil War included Sheridan's \"Rienzi\" and Stonewall Jackson's \"Little Sorrel\".\n\nEarly in the war, Union cavalry forces were often wasted by being used merely as pickets, outposts, orderlies, guards for senior officers, and messengers. The first officer to make effective use of the Union cavalry was Major General Joseph Hooker, who in 1863 consolidated the cavalry forces of his Army of the Potomac under a single commander, George Stoneman.\nHalfway into the war, during the summer of 1863, the Union cavalry came into its own. Widely regarded as inferior to its Southern counterpart up until then, the Battle of Brandy Station, although tactically indecisive, is recognized as the point at which it was acknowledged to have comparable competence.\n\nIn 1864, Philip Sheridan was given command of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and he deployed his horsemen in a more effective, strategic way than his predecessors. Despite the reluctance of his superior, Major General George G. Meade, Sheridan convinced General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant to allow him to deploy the cavalry in long-range raids, the first of which, at Yellow Tavern, resulted in the death of Confederate commander Jeb Stuart. He later employed his cavalry force effectively in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 and the Appomattox Campaign, in pursuit of Robert E. Lee.\n\nIn the Western Theater, two effective cavalry generals have not achieved the fame of their Eastern counterparts: Benjamin Grierson's dramatic raid through Mississippi was an integral part of Ulysses S. Grant's Vicksburg Campaign; James H. Wilson was invaluable in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and in his 1865 Alabama raid.\n\nThe following are Civil War battles, campaigns, or separate raids in which cavalry forces played a significant role.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her parents later moved to Cawker City, Kansas when she was two years old. She attended Washburn Preparatory Academy in Topeka, Kansas from 1906 to 1907, she graduated at 15, and after a year at Broadway High School in Seattle, Washington, returned as a student in the Fine Arts Department at Washburn College. Intent on further refining her daughters' education and position in society, Rosella and her daughters returned to Seattle in the fall of 1910. On July 14, 1913, Ola was chosen for the role of Empress during the lavish musical production of \"Jappyland\". While living in Seattle, Ola met David Willis Bowes and the intense relationship continued by correspondence after Mr. Bowes' return to Denver. Soon a June wedding was planned, but en route back to Kansas, Ola secretly married Mr. Bowes on May 13, 1914, in Denver, Colorado. The union resulted in the birth of a son, David Willis Bowes Jr., on September 9, 1916, but the couple soon went their separate ways. Bowes officially filed for divorce on September 14, 1920. She moved to California to be reunited with her parents who had recently retired. Seeking a way to support herself and baby son, Ola took the advice of a friend and quickly found employment at the movie studios. Initially receiving only bit parts, she was soon spotted by Lois Weber, a highly regarded and influential director and producer of silent films for Paramount Pictures. Weber immediately signed Windsor to a contract. \n\nClaire Windsor's film debut was in the 1920 release of Lois Weber's \"To Please One Woman\" which was only a modest success. To promote the nascent starlet, Paramount Pictures often paired Windsor with the newly divorced actor Charlie Chaplin in publicity photographs, leading the tabloid press to give mention to the young actress in print. In 1921, Windsor costarred with Louis Calhern in Weber's \"The Blot\" (1921). The publicity paid off; in 1922 the newly formed Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers (WAMPAS) began their annual WAMPAS Baby Stars awards and she was named, along with Bessie Love, Lila Lee, Mary Philbin and Colleen Moore, as the year's most promising starlets. That same year Claire signed a contract with Goldwyn Pictures Corporation. She would appear in \"Broken Chains\" with fellow WAMPAS Baby Star Colleen Moore.\n\nIn 1923, the former Ola Cronk officially began using the more matinee-friendly \"Claire Windsor\" as a moniker. Throughout the 1920s, Windsor established herself as highly regarded leading lady in film. As her career progressed, she was often typecast as the \"upscale society girl\", often playing the part of a princess, or monied socialite. Critics lauded her elegant fashion sense, and Windsor became a noted trend-setter of 1920s fashion.\nIn 1924, Windsor was one of the top stars at the newly formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio. Later, at Tiffany Pictures, \"Souls for Sables\" (1925), co-starring Eugene O'Brien, was a box-office hit for Windsor.\n\nWindsor was frequently romantically linked to her leading male co-stars. She had a well-publicized affair with actor Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, and in 1925 married matinée idol Bert Lytell. The couple divorced in 1927, however. Windsor never remarried, but a few notable love affairs with men caused minor scandals in the press, including once being sued by the young wife of a Boston broker in an \"Alienation of Affection\" lawsuit, in which the broker's wife contended that Windsor had \"stolen her husband\".\n\nBy the late 1920s, Claire Windsor (like so many of her acting peers) found it difficult to move into talkies. She made several talkies throughout the 1930s but could never recapture the success of her earlier years as a silent screen actress. She had a brief stint on a road tour with Al Jolson in the production of \"The Wonder Bar\" and occasionally took stage parts. In her later years, Windsor devoted herself to painting.\n\nOn April 12, 1943, Windsor legally changed her name to Claire Windsor, and her son took the name of William Willis Windsor.\n\nClaire Windsor died of a heart attack on October 24, 1972, at the age of 80 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, California. (Windsor's age at death is reported as 74 in Sidney D. Kirkpatrick's 1986 book \"Cast of Killers\"). She was buried at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery.\n\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Claire Windsor was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood, California on February 8, 1960.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2249267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249267", "title": "Tallaght Stadium", "text": "Tallaght Stadium\n\nTallaght Stadium () is an association football stadium in the Republic of Ireland based in Tallaght, South Dublin. The club Shamrock Rovers originally announced details of the stadium in July 1996. The stadium is now owned and operated by South Dublin County Council with Shamrock Rovers as the anchor tenants.\n\nThe main stand holds home supporters, away supporters, club officials and press. A second stand on the opposite (east) side of the ground, was completed in August 2009. This stand holds the stadium's TV gantry and has brought the seating capacity to 6,000. Both stands are covered. A temporary south stand was constructed over a short period in early September 2011 for Rovers's games in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage. Refreshment stalls are located at the southern end as is a stadium control room.\n\nIn June 2013 a scoreboard was added to the stadium control room.\n\nTemporary seating has been constructed at the stadium three times—once for a club friendly against Real Madrid, which gave the ground a temporary capacity of 10,900 again before the 2009 FAI Cup Final, giving the ground a temporary capacity of 8,500 and for Rovers' games in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage.\n\nLocated behind the main stand is the Shamrock Rovers Megastore. Though previously run by kit supplier, Umbro, it is now fully operated by Rovers. The Megastore was expanded in March 2011 to include the Rovers Café. Within the Café is a large collection of memorabilia and trophies from the Club's foundation in 1901 to the present day that have been donated to the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust and have been placed on public display. For the 2013 League of Ireland season the cafe was replaced with a Customer service area.\n\nThe Glenmalure Suite in Tallaght Stadium is an exclusive bar area open to club members only on match days.\nClub members can visit the Glenmalure Suite 60 minutes before kick off, at half time, and after the game for 30 minutes. Occasional post match Q&A with the manager and players are held in the suite.\n\nThe following chronology is taken from the Judgement from the High Court on the Judicial Review.\n\nOn 10 February 1997 South Dublin County Council passed a resolution to lease land comprising approximately at Whitestown Way for the construction of a Stadium for Shamrock Rovers F.C. On 14 January 1998 planning permission was granted and on 24 March 2000 the lease was granted to Mulden International Limited. On 20 October 2000 Mulden International Limited transferred their lease to Slonepark Company Limited to build the stadium and work commenced in October 2000. Work ceased at the site in November 2001 with the pitch and drainage laid, the main stand almost complete and other buildings in various states of completion.\n\nFollowing a prolonged period where no work was carried out at the stadium and a refusal by the Planning Authority in December 2004 to extend the lease the Council terminated the lease on 4 January 2004.\n\nAn examiner was appointed to Shamrock Rovers F.C. on 11 April 2005 and the council engaged in discussions with the examiner regarding the completion of the stadium and its use by Shamrock Rovers Football Club when completed. Following the examinership process a supporters group, the '400 Club' took control of Shamrock Rovers and run the club today as the Shamrock Rovers Members Club.\n\nA public consultation process began on 18 July 2005 to complete the soccer stadium at Sean Walsh Memorial Park. Thomas Davis CLG participated fully in the public consultation process. A county Managers report was presented to the Council on 12 December 2005 which provided for the increase of playing area to accommodate senior Gaelic games and other uses subject to allocation of funds from the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism. The council then informed the Department of the resolution and request clarification regarding funding from the Department.\n\nA reply was received from the Department on 24 January 2006 stating that the Minister could not agree to make funding available for the modified development.\n\nActing on the Ministers response the Council voted in favour of proceeding with the original plans on 13 February 2006.\n\nThomas Davis GAA club instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that the decision of the council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture'. However the stadium, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium's dimensions. It was only senior GAA games that would not have been facilitated.\n\nThe disagreement had several low points that were played out in the media. Some Shamrock Rovers fans unveiled a banner at a league game showing their contempt for Thomas Davis's actions in taking the matter to court. And contrary to the GAA policy of being apolitical Thomas Davis GAA club made it known that the Minister of State Conor Lenihan TD, the local Dáil representative, was no longer welcome at the club because of his support for Minister John O'Donoghue's stance and called for the clubs members to make the stadium a General Election issue.\n\nThe judicial review began on 20 April 2007 and concluded on 14 December 2007. In the High Court decision Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy found in favour of South Dublin Co. Council and Shamrock Rovers. He found that Thomas Davis had no financial or proprietary interest in the development site having had no agreement with SDCC for its use and noted the extensive facilities they had already been given by the council. And so Thomas Davis was not prejudiced by the decision being made in February rather than late January. The resolution to change the stadium was conditional on additional funding from the Department in the absence of this funding the resolution could not stand or, more properly, could not be implemented. The court concluded that \"it would be wrong of the respondent to commit itself to unbudgeted expenditure or to delay the implementation of its resolution of 13 February 2005. The court, accordingly, refuses the relief sought by Thomas Davis.\"\n\nAn application by Thomas Davis for leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme court was refused by Judge Murphy on 25 January 2008. Building commenced on the stadium on 6 May 2008, six and a half years after work had first stopped.\n\nThe first game in the new stadium was held on 13 March 2009. Rovers made a winning start to life in Tallaght as they saw off the challenge of Sligo Rovers 2-1 in front of a sell-out crowd of 3,000. Gary Twigg had the honour of being the first man to score at the new stadium.\n\nThe stadium was officially opened on Saturday 27 June.\n\nOn 20 July 2009, Shamrock Rovers played Real Madrid at Tallaght Stadium as part of a \"festival of football\" which also included games against Newcastle United and Hibernian. Temporary seating was installed taking capacity up to 10,900. Real Madrid won the game by one goal to nil with a late goal. The match was notable for the debut appearance of Cristiano Ronaldo for Real Madrid.\nThe second (east) stand was opened for a game against Dundalk on 22 August, which attracted over 4,500 fans. The stadium was sold out the following week, albeit with capacity restrictions (meaning a crowd of about 5,400) for a derby with St Patrick's Athletic. Its first full house with the new capacity came against Bohemians on 2 October 2009, when tickets, 6,000 of which were issued, were sold out a week in advance.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team played Georgia on 9 October in Tallaght stadium, drawing 1-1. The 2009 FAI Cup Final was held at the stadium. Sporting Fingal were winners over Sligo Rovers before 8,105 people.\n\nThe Setanta Sports Cup Final has been held on three occasions at Tallaght Stadium, in 2010, 2011 and the 2013. In the latter final, on 13 May 2013, Shamrock Rovers defeated Drogheda United 7-1.\n\nTallaght Stadium won the 2010 Airtricity League Pitch of the Year award. It also won the 2010 Airtricity League Pitch of the Year award.\n\nThe biggest league attendance since Rovers moved to Tallaght was a 0-1 loss to Bohemians in front of a crowd of 6,414 on 23 April 2019. That attendance figure was topped later that season with 7,021 attending a Rovers-Bohemians derby in which Shamrock Rovers were victorious 1-0 on 30 August 2019. The following season Rovers beat Dundalk 3-2 in front of a record Tallaght crowd of 7,522 on 28 February 2020.\n\nThe first European game in the stadium was held in July 2010 when Rovers drew with Bnei Yehuda of Tel Avivin the UEFA Europa League.\n\nAfter Rovers eliminated the Israelis the next round draw saw Juventus play at the stadium in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nThe stadium hosted its first UEFA Champions League game in July 2011 and hosted Rovers' games in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage.\n\nIn order to comply with UEFA criteria for participating in the group stages of the UEFA Europa League, a south stand was constructed over a short period in early September 2011. Although constructed with temporary style construction techniques & materials the new stand was passed fit by UEFA inspectors as fulfilling the criteria for permanent seating. The inclusion of the new south stand brought the stadium capacity above the minimum of 8,500 seats needed to be classified as a Category 4 Stadium as laid out in the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations.\n\nAfter the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League group stage the seats were removed to bring the capacity of the stadium back to 6,000.\n\nDue to seating restrictions at Richmond Park, St Patrick's Athletic played a 2011–12 UEFA Europa League home game against Karpaty Lviv at Tallaght Stadium, and a 2012–13 UEFA Europa League game against Hannover 96.\n\nRovers played FK Ekranas in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League in July 2012.\n\nThe stadium hosted Dundalk's home match against BATE Borisov in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, and later their home Europa League group stage matches in 2016–17, after their home ground, Oriel Park, did not meet UEFA standards for hosting matches at either stage.\n\nThe main stand runs the length of the west side of the pitch and was the first stand to open in the stadium. One corner of the main stand is used to house away supporters. The main stand also houses the dressing rooms. The club's superstore is situated behind the stand.\n\nThe east stand runs the length of the east side of the pitch and is the most recent stand to open in the stadium. The ultras within the club's support base currently congregate in the east stand. In July 2010 a control room was constructed at the car park end of the east stand.\n\n2010 Rugby League European Championship\n\nIreland played their last match in the 2010 European Cup against Scotland losing 42-22. http://www.rlef.eu.com/european_cup/report?RLE00000026\n\n2014 Rugby League European Championship\n\nAs part of the 2014 Rugby League European Cup, Tallaght Stadium hosted the match between Ireland and France on 17 October, kick off at 8 pm.\n\nTallaght stadium also hosted the match between Ireland and Scotland on 25 October, kick off at 2pm.\nhttp://www.rli.ie/article/12192/european-championships-announced\n\nThe stadium hosted its first rugby international game when a crowd of over 4,000 saw the Ireland A national rugby union team defeat their Argentinian counterparts in November 2009.\n\nThe first club rugby game was held in August 2012 as 2011–12 Heineken Cup winners Leinster Rugby beat Gloucester Rugby in a pre season friendly.\n\nThe 2010 Shamrock Bowl, the final of the Irish American Football League was held on 7 August 2010. Dublin Rebels defeated the University of Limerick Vikings 15-0. The final was expected to be played in Tallaght again in 2011, should a Dublin-based team reach the final however Morton Stadium was selected over Tallaght Stadium to host the 2011 Final.

The town found its prosperity in the mid-19th century. Located near Rolla on the Ozark Plateau, the only remaining business at Arlington was a RV park that closed permanently in 2008.\n\nArlington was originally called Little Piney. It was manned at times by troops form the 5th Missouri State Militia Cavalry. Originally settled by Thomas Harrison and James Harrison and later established as a township by General Fremont \"circa\" 1867, the town was renamed for the former Robert E. Lee plantation (later a cemetery) at Arlington, Virginia, Folk etymology maintains the name honors Arlie, the wife of a local merchant. Arlington was once a popular resort served by the Pacific Railroad. Located on the last section of U.S. Route 66 in Missouri to be paved, in 1931, the tiny community served fishermen on the Gasconade and Little Piney Rivers.\n\nStony Dell Resort capitalised on Route 66 and the nearby Fort Leonard Wood military base to grow in the 1930s and early 1940s from a small group of tourist cabins to a popular oasis which included a stream-fed swimming pool, a restaurant, service station and bus stop, offering tennis, dancing, boating and fishing.\n\nBy 1946, the town was in decline due to re-routing of a widened US 66; the town site was purchased that year by R. E. Carney. The original 1923 US 66 road bridge, bypassed when the road was widened to four lanes in 1952, was demolished when Interstate 44 bypassed the town in 1966-1967, leaving the original two-lane US 66 a dead end. Most of the Stony Dell Resort was lost to demolition during freeway construction; the restaurant, archway, the fish pond, the gas, food, and gift store, some of the classic stone work, and a handful of cabins remain, now abandoned. Even the 1952 four lane bridge was demolished and replaced as part of a 2005 alignment of I-44.\n\nThere are no remaining businesses, the caravan park (Arlington River Resort, 13003 Arlington Road) closed permanently in 2008. The only road access to the townsite is I-44 to Newburg then back on what remains of the original two-lane US 66 roadway (Arlington Outer Road, a dead-end). No longer easily accessed by rail and road, Arlington is now merely a small group of private residences. Arlington is currently composed of more than 20 people; albeit, it is no longer its own township and is now a part of Newburg.\n"}

She was stabbed 27 times by an armed forces death squad (allegedly trained at the School of the Americas) because she had criticized the government for its human rights abuses of the indigenous Mayan communities. \n\nHer sister, mother and associates took up her case, determined to win justice for her death. Following the Peace Accords and end of the overt civil war, Guatemala was beginning to take actions to document abuses during the civil war, with testimony collected by the National Commission. Her sister Helen Mack filed a case with the Inter-American Human Rights Commission in Washington, DC and later with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. In 1993 she set up the Fundación Myrna Mack to support the prosecution and to do other work for human rights.\n\nOn November 25, 2003, the court ruled that Mack had been killed by government forces. In April 2004, following the judgment issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Guatemalan government publicly acknowledged that its agents had committed the killing of Myrna Mack. It provided her next-of-kin with a financial compensation package as part of the court settlement.\n\nHer sister Helen Mack was honored with a Right Livelihood Award in 1992 \"for her personal courage and persistence in seeking justice and an end to the impunity of political murderers.\" She continues to work for human rights and has received other recognition for it.\n\n\n\n"}

Fatehabad district was later created as well.\n\nHisar is a divisional headquarters of the Hisar division Divisional Commissioner and also the headquarters of Police Range. It is also a battalion headquarters of B.S.F. 3rd Bn. H.A.P. and commando force. In order to accommodate all of these departments, a five-storey District Administrative Complex was built, with the offices transferred in 1980. It adjoins the new Judiciary Complex, which is also made functional. This administrative and judiciary complex is the largest in Haryana; as a district headquarters it may be one of the largest in the country.\n\nIt is one of the five cities belonging to Sarasvati Valley Civilization while its name is cited in the history books in the context of Indus civilization and in general knowledge books as the location of Banawali, one of five sheep farms.\nAs of 2011 it is the second most populous of the 21 districts of Haryana, after Faridabad.\n\nHisar is also known as the steel city because of the Jindal Stainless Steel Factories. It is also the largest producer of galvanized iron in India.\n\nThe district suffered famine in 1783-84 (Chalisa famine), 1838, 1860-61, 1896-97 and 1899-1900.\n\nHisar continued to be the District Headquarters of the largest District in the state until its reorganization in 1966 when parts were carved out to create the new Jind District. The Tehsil Bhiwani and Loharu estate were later transferred to Bhiwani district on its creation in 1974. It was further bifurcated when Sirsa district was created entirely out of Hisar District. Fatehabad district has now been carved out of this district.\n\nAt present Hisar district consists of the eight tehsils of Adampur, Agroha, Barwala, Hisar, Hansi-1, Hansi-2, Narnaund and Uklanamandi, <br> two Sub-Tehsils of Balsamand and Bass. Vehicle registration numbers for Hisar district are: Hisar HR 20 and HR 39 (commercial no), Hansi HR 21 and Barwala HR 80.\n\nHisar is a divisional headquarters of the Divisional Commissioner and also the headquarters of the Police Range. It is also a battalion Headquarters of Border Security Force, 3rd battalion of Haryana Armed Police and police commando force. All these departments are now housed in a five storied District Administrative Complex completed in 1980, which adjoins the new Judiciary Complex.\n\nThe district has seven Vidhan Sabha constituencies, namely, Adampur, Uklana, Narnaund, Hansi, Barwala, Hisar and Nalwa. All of these are part of Hisar Lok Sabha constituency\n\n the district had a population of 1,743,931, roughly equal to the nation of The Gambia or the US state of Nebraska. This gave it a ranking of 276th in India out of a total of 640 districts.\nThe district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 13.38%. Hisar has a sex ratio of 871 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 73.2%.\n\nAt the time of the 2011 Census of India, 96.08% of the population in the district spoke Hindi and 3.11% Punjabi as their first language.Haryanvi is the most spoken dialect in the district.\n\nHisar is 98% Hindu, only about 40,000 are Muslims, rest are mostly Jain and Sikhs.\n\nThe important social groups in the district are Jats, Bishnois, Brahmins, Sainis, Banias, Ahirs, Gujjars, Kumhars, Aroras, Chamars and Balmikis. Jat is the largest social group in the city. They are of two types, Deswalis and Bagris. Bishnois have migrated from Rajasthan. There are three sections of Brahmins in the district, i.e., Gaur, Bias and Khandelwal. Most of the Aroras are migrant from West Punjab after the partition of the country in 1947. Banias are divided into Aggarwals, Oswals and Maheshwaris. The Aggarwals are said to be the descendants of the inhabitants of Agroha. They hold Agroha in great reverence. Oswals and Maheshwaris trace their origin to the Rajasthan. The Gujjars of Hisar trace their origin to Rajasthan.\n\nNorth Hisar district falls in doab between Ghagghar river flowing through fatehabad district and paleo channel of Dhrishadvati river flowing through the Narnaul tehsil. Eastern, central and south-eastern Hisar district falls in doab between Dhrishadvati river and Yamuna river. Western Hisar district is part of bagar tract. The regions of the \"doabs\" near the rivers consist of low-lying, flood-prone, but usually very fertile \"khadir\" and the higher-lying land away from the rivers consist of \"bangar\", less prone to flooding but also less fertile on average. For the purpose of irrigation, Hisar district has been classified into 5 circles, namely barani (low rain area where rain-fed dry farming is practiced which nowadays are dependent on tubewells for the irrigation), bagar (dry sandy tract of land on the border of Rajasthan state adjoining the states of Haryana and Pujab) nahri (canal-irrigated land), nali or naili (fertile prairie tract between the Ghaggar river and the southern limits of the Saraswati channel depression in northern Hissar district of Haryana that gets flooded during the rains), and Rangoi tract (an area irrigated by the Rangoi canal made for the purpose of carrying flood waters of Ghagghar river to dry areas).\n\nHisar has fertile alluvial soil interspersed with highly permeable very sandy tracts in bagar tract several with water table more than 100 feet below ground containing brackish water usually unfit for human consumption, where dust storms frequent during the warm summer months from April till the end of July when monsoon arrives. Previously, Hisar was solely based on the rain and irrigation was possible only in the \"nali\" region where the season Ghaggar river flows in North Hisar. After the opening of Bhakra Nangal Dam canal system in 1963 as well as the earlier Western Yamuna Canal now irrigate most of Haryana including all of the Bagar region falling in Haryana on its western border. Opening of Indira Gandhi Canal in 1983 (specially Hansi Butana branches) brought the water of Sutlej and Beas rivers to the fields of Rajasthan including its Bagar tract stabilizing the sand dunes and soil erosion by preventing the expansion of desert.\n\n\nThere are 10 govt degree colleges in Hisar.\n\n\nHisar also has several renowned schools including Leading Angel Public School, Hisar (LAPS), Indus Public School, Hisar (IPS), Army Public School, Hisar (APS), Thakur Dass Bhargava Senior Secondary Model School and Vidya Devi Jindal School.\n\nOver the past three centuries Hisar had been the birthplace of individuals including Sardar Ishri Singh, Sardar Harji Ram and Rai Bahadur Sardar Nau Nihal Singh who were honorary magistrates in pre-Independence Hisar. Noteworthy individuals include the Lala Lajpat Rai (freedom fighter, elected member of Hisar municipal committee, founder of Hisar district congress (1986), Arya samaj (1986) and district bar council), Captain Abhimanyu Sindhu (entrepreneur, journalist, BJP national spokesperson and Minister in Haryana from Narnaul assembly constituency), late Dr. Gopi Chand Bhargava (First Chief Minister of joint Punjab), Om Prakash Jindal (former chairperson of Jindal Industries and Minister in Haryana government) and his wife Savitri Jindal (chairperson of Jindal Industries and Minister in Haryana government), Subhash Chandra (Chairman of Essel Group and Zee Network and BJP MP in Rajya Sabha), Amit Munjal, founder and CEO of and Former CFO of Citi Holdings, Yash Tonk (Bollywood actor), Manish Joshi Bismil (theatre director), General V.K.

{"id": "2249310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249310", "title": "Aether theories", "text": "Aether theories\n\nIn physics, aether theories (also known as ether theories) propose the existence of a medium, a space-filling substance or field, thought to be necessary as a transmission medium for the propagation of electromagnetic or gravitational forces. Since the development of special relativity, theories using a substantial aether fell out of use in modern physics, and are now joined by more abstract models.\n\nThis early modern aether has little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed. The assorted theories embody the various conceptions of this medium and substance.\n\nAlbert Einstein sometimes used the word \"aether\" for the gravitational field within general relativity, but this terminology never gained widespread support. \n\nQuantum mechanics can be used to describe spacetime as being non-empty at extremely small scales, fluctuating and generating particle pairs that appear and disappear incredibly quickly. It has been suggested by some such as Paul Dirac that this quantum vacuum may be the equivalent in modern physics of a particulate aether. However, Dirac's aether hypothesis was motivated by his dissatisfaction with quantum electrodynamics, and it never gained support from the mainstream scientific community.\n\nRobert B. Laughlin, Nobel Laureate in Physics, endowed chair in physics, Stanford University, had this to say about ether in contemporary theoretical physics:\n\nLouis de Broglie stated, \"Any particle, ever isolated, has to be imagined as in continuous \"energetic contact\" with a hidden medium.\"\n\nIsaac Newton suggests the existence of an aether in the Third Book of \"Opticks\" (1st ed. 1704; 2nd ed. 1718): \"Doth not this aethereal medium in passing out of water, glass, crystal, and other compact and dense bodies in empty spaces, grow denser and denser by degrees, and by that means refract the rays of light not in a point, but by bending them gradually in curve lines? ...Is not this medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun, stars, planets and comets, than in the empty celestial space between them? And in passing from them to great distances, doth it not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?\"\n\nIn the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light (electromagnetic radiation). However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been carried out in the late 1800s like the Michelson-Morley experiment in an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed aether-dragging theories could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. Joseph Larmor discussed the aether in terms of a moving magnetic field caused by the acceleration of electrons.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell said of the aether, \"In several parts of this treatise an attempt has been made to explain electromagnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action transmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the space between them. The undulatory theory of light also assumes the existence of a medium. We have now to show that the properties of the electromagnetic medium are identical with those of the luminiferous medium.\"\n\nHendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald offered within the framework of Lorentz ether theory a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, Albert Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether at all. This led most physicists to conclude that this early modern notion of a luminiferous aether was not a useful concept. Einstein however stated that this consideration was too radical and too anticipatory and that his theory of relativity still needed the presence of a medium with certain properties.\n\nFrom the 16th until the late 19th century, gravitational phenomena had also been modelled utilizing an aether. The most well-known formulation is Le Sage's theory of gravitation, although other models were proposed by Isaac Newton, Bernhard Riemann, and Lord Kelvin. None of those concepts are considered to be viable by the scientific community today.\n\nAccording to the philosophical point of view of Einstein, Dirac, Bell, Polyakov, ’t Hooft, Laughlin, de Broglie, Maxwell, Newton and other theorists, there might be a medium with physical properties filling 'empty' space, an aether, enabling the observed physical processes.\n\nAlbert Einstein in 1894 or 1895: \"The velocity of a wave is proportional to the square root of the elastic forces which cause [its] propagation, and inversely proportional to the mass of the aether moved by these forces.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein in 1920: \"We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an Aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without Aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this Aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.\"\n\nPaul Dirac wrote in 1951: \"Physical knowledge has advanced much since 1905, notably by the arrival of quantum mechanics, and the situation [about the scientific plausibility of Aether] has again changed. If one examines the question in the light of present-day knowledge, one finds that the Aether is no longer ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be advanced for postulating an Aether ... We have now the velocity at all points of space-time, playing a fundamental part in electrodynamics. It is natural to regard it as the velocity of some real physical thing. Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics [vacuum filled with virtual particles] we are rather forced to have an Aether\".\n\nJohn Bell in 1986, interviewed by Paul Davies in \"The Ghost in the Atom\" has suggested that an Aether theory might help resolve the EPR paradox by allowing a reference frame in which signals go faster than light. He suggests Lorentz contraction is perfectly coherent, not inconsistent with relativity, and could produce an aether theory perfectly consistent with the Michelson-Morley experiment. Bell suggests the aether was wrongly rejected on purely philosophical grounds: \"what is unobservable does not exist\" [p. 49]. Einstein found the non-aether theory simpler and more elegant, but Bell suggests that doesn't rule it out. Besides the arguments based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bell also suggests resurrecting the aether because it is a useful pedagogical device. That is, many problems are solved more easily by imagining the existence of an aether.\n\nEinstein remarked \"God does not play dice with the Universe\". And those agreeing with him are looking for a classical, deterministic aether theory that would imply quantum-mechanical predictions as a statistical approximation, a hidden variable theory. In particular, Gerard 't Hooft conjectured that: \"We should not forget that quantum mechanics does not really describe what kind of dynamical phenomena are actually going on, but rather gives us probabilistic results. To me, it seems extremely plausible that any reasonable theory for the dynamics at the Planck scale would lead to processes that are so complicated to describe, that one should expect apparently stochastic fluctuations in any approximation theory describing the effects of all of this at much larger scales. It seems quite reasonable first to try a classical, deterministic theory for the Planck domain. One might speculate then that what we call quantum mechanics today, may be nothing else than an ingenious technique to handle this dynamics statistically.\" In their paper Blasone, Jizba and Kleinert \"have attempted to substantiate the recent proposal of G. ’t Hooft in which quantum theory is viewed as not a complete field theory, but is in fact an emergent phenomenon arising from a deeper level of dynamics. The underlying dynamics are taken to be classical mechanics with singular Lagrangians supplied with an appropriate information loss condition. With plausible assumptions about the actual nature of the constraint dynamics, quantum theory is shown to emerge when the classical Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for constrained dynamics is applied to the classical path integral [...].\"\n\nLouis de Broglie, \"If a hidden sub-quantum medium is assumed, knowledge of its nature would seem desirable. It certainly is of quite complex character. It could not serve as a universal reference medium, as this would be contrary to relativity theory.\"\n\nIn 1982, Ioan-Iovitz Popescu, a Romanian physicist, wrote that the aether is \"a form of existence of the matter, but it differs qualitatively from the common (atomic and molecular) substance or radiation (photons)\". The \"fluid aether\" is \"governed by the principle of inertia and its presence produces a modification of the space-time geometry\". Built upon Le Sage's \"ultra-mundane corpuscles\", Popescu's theory posits a finite Universe \"filled with some particles of exceedingly small mass, traveling chaotically at speed of light\" and material bodies \"made up of such particles called \"etherons\"\".\n\nSid Deutsch, a professor of electrical engineering and bioengineering, conjectures that a \"spherical, spinning\" \"aether particle\" must exist in order \"to carry electromagnetic waves\" and derives its diameter and mass using the density of dark matter.\n\nA degenerate Fermi fluid model, \"composed primarily of \"electrons and positrons\"\" that has the consequence of a speed of light decreasing \"with time on the scale of the age of the universe\" was proposed by Allen Rothwarf. In a cosmological extension the model was \"extended to predict a \"decelerating expansion of the universe\"\".\n\n\n"}

The song was released on March 1, 2005 as the third single from her debut album, \"Goodies\". The downtempo Crunk&B song features hip-hop elements and a heavy bassline, and can be seen as an anthem to her hometown, Atlanta, Georgia. Ciara sings about the many things the city has to offer, while Ludacris raps the third verse.\n\nThe song was well received by music critics, who praised the song's beat, specifically noting its radio-friendliness. It won an award at the 2006 ASCAP award shows for \"Most Performed Songs\" with the two previous singles from \"Goodies\", \"Goodies\" and \"1, 2 Step.\" The song also took home the award for \"Choice Music Make-Out Song\" at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards and for \"Coolest Collabo\" at the 2006 Vibe Awards. The song was listed at number 127 on \"Pitchfork Media\"'s top 500 songs of the 2000s. The song was placed at number 72 on \"Slant\"'s The 100 Best Singles of the Aughts. It, along with other songs on \"Goodies\", helped earn Ciara the nomination for Best New Artist at the 48th Grammy Awards.\n\nThe single was a commercial success, peaking at number two in the United States, becoming her third consecutive top three hit. It also peaked within the top ten of charts in many international markets, including Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum in the US and gold in Australia. The song was accompanied by a music video, which showed the singer dancing with friends in the streets of Atlanta, as well as in an arena and a parking garage.\n\nIn 2004, Ciara was in the recording studio with Dre & Vidal. She decided to take the beat back to Atlanta, Georgia. It took Ciara one week to complete the lyrics for the love song to Atlanta. She quoted, \"I didn't waste time and just write to any beat. If I don't like a beat, I won't work with it.\" Also she recalled, \"I wanted to make sure that we were actually talking about Atlanta\".\n\nWhile composing the lyrics, Ciara spoke to her management to get Ludacris on the track and he agreed. She said, \"I think Ludacris is perfect\".\n\n\"Oh\" received positive reviews from music critics. \"Pop Matters\" described the track as \"dark\" and \"infectious\", \"whose beat approximates the David Banner-constructed \"Rubber Band Man\" banger.\" Musicomh.com opined that \"Oh\" is \"far and away the album's best track\" and the \"ultimate cruising tune.\" Virgin Media wrote that it was \"the album's standout track\". One negative review of the song, published by \"The Situation\", said the song was \"not as strong\" as other songs on the album, \"as Luda's raspy vocals overpower Ciara's sweet tone.\"\n\n\"Oh\" went on to win an award at the 2006 ASCAP award shows for \"Most Performed Songs\" with the two previous singles from \"Goodies\", \"Goodies\" and \"1, 2 Step.\" The song also took home the award for \"Choice Music Make-Out Song\" at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards and for \"Coolest Collabo\" at the 2006 Vibe Awards.

The song debuted at number 75 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 the week of March 25, 2005, and became Ciara's third top five single. Eventually \"Oh\" became Ciara's second song in a row (after \"1, 2 Step\") to reach a peak of number two on the chart, being stuck for a single week behind Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\". It also peaked at two on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, stuck for two weeks behind Bobby Valentino's \"Slow Down\", and number one on the Rhythmic Top 40 and Hot 100 Airplay. The song spent a total of 33 weeks on the chart. The song also peaked number six on the Pop 100, Pop 100 Airplay, and Top 40 Mainstream. It was a minor sales hit, peaking at fifteen on the Hot Digital Songs. \"Oh\" was commissioned dance remixes. The song appeared on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart, peaking at number 20. The \"DJ Volume South Beach\" remix appears on the bonus CD of \"\". The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million digital copies in the United States.\n\nAlso, \"Oh\" was a hit outside the US. The song debuted and peaked at number four in the United Kingdom and number five for two weeks in New Zealand. The song also peaked at number seven in Australia, Germany, and Ireland. It was also a top twenty hit in Finland and Switzerland.\n\n\"Oh.\" was listed at number 21 on the Top Hot 100 Hits of 2005.\n\nThe music video for \"Oh\" was directed by the Fat Cats. It begins with Ciara sitting with \"little\" Ciara watching a video player. The camera zooms into the video player and reveals an overview of Atlanta and scenes of Ciara and her friends at a block party in an alley. She performs the first verse and first chorus in the middle of the street, while she is surrounded by guests and their cars. There are dance sequences throughout the remainder of the video and a scene with Ciara performing on top of a car as Ludacris raps. Ciara is also \"ridin' slow\" in a classic model Oldsmobile. There is also a cameo by Gucci Mane and Boyz n da Hood.\n\nCiara described the choreography as \"the real star\" and \"very intense\". Also, Ciara quoted that she and her choreographer tried \"to find the best moves that we can\". The video was choreographed by Devyne Stephens.

It made its first broadcast on 19 July 1955.\n\nEesti Televisioon (\"Estonian Television\") was launched on 19 July 1955. Before that, television broadcasts in Estonia could only be received from Moscow. The very first Estonian-language TV presenter was Ofelia Mikk, whose debut was in the 19 July 1955 test broadcast. Her tenure in television was cut short, because she misspoke out of nervousness.\n\nThe first tenured presenter for the nascent ETV was Ruth Peramets-Püss (1927–2005). To find a presenter, a casting competition was held in 1955, but no suitable person was found. By chance, a film in which she starred, was aired on ETV on the day of the competition, and so she was hired.\n\nKalmer Tennosaar began as a presenter on 1 January 1956, and subsequently worked as an editor and fellow of music programmes (1957–1962, and then after 1968). He became very popular as the host of a children's songs show \"Entel-tentel\". Tennosaar later continued his career as a singer.\n\nOn 1 January 1993, ETV was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). From the restoration of independence in 1991 to 31 December 1992, it was a member of the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT).\n\nETV stopped showing commercials in 1998–1999, and has again ceased doing so since 2002: its low-cost advertising rates were damaging the ability of commercial broadcasters to operate. The introduction of a system of broadcast receiver licences, payable by viewers, was considered, but ultimately rejected in the face of public opposition.\n\nIn 2002, ETV hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2002.\n\nOn 9 January 2006, ETV launched an Internet news service called ETV24. Broadcasting news on Internet, teletext, and on ETV at night.\nPursuant to the new Estonian National Broadcasting Act passed by the Estonian Parliament on 18 January 2007, ETV controversially merged with Eesti Raadio (Estonian Radio Service, \"ER\") on 1 June 2007 to form the Estonian Public Broadcasting service, or Eesti Rahvusringhääling (ERR). During the consolidation, the \"ETV24\" news service was replaced with \"ERR Uudised\" (ERR News). However, ETV retained its original name, and continues broadcasting with it.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Estonia completed its transition to digital terrestrial television, discontinuing all analogue services. An informational on-screen message indicating this was visible on the old ETV frequencies until 5 July 2010.\n\nThe bulk of ETV's funding comes from government grant-in-aid, around 15% of which is in turn funded by the fees paid by Estonian commercial broadcasters in return for their exclusive right to screen television advertising. ETV itself is editorially fully independent.\n\nThe Estonian Public Broadcasting Act regulates ERR's activities in Estonia through the Estonian Broadcasting Council (Estonian: Ringhäälingunõukogu, EHR for short).\n\nThe Broadcasting Council is the highest management body of ERR.\n\nThe first Chair of ERR is Margus Allikmaa.\n\nThe more well known journalists of ETV include Tõnu Aav, Maire Aunaste, Anu Välba, Katrin Viirpalu, Reet Linna, Monika Tamla, Kadri Hinrikus, Astrid Kannel, Margus Saar, Peeter Kaldre, Mati Talvik, Marko Reikop, Urmas Vaino, Jim Ashilevi, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He then studied at FAMU in Prague, but did not finish the course. He began his career as an assistant director on Ladislav Helge's \"Velká samota\".\n\nLater he collaborated with his friend Forman on all of Forman's Czech films, including \"Loves of a Blonde\" (1965) and \"The Firemen's Ball\" (1967), both of which Passer co-wrote and which were nominated for Academy Awards.

{"id": "2249388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249388", "title": "Dimethyl sulfide", "text": "Dimethyl sulfide\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS) or methylthiomethane is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH)S. Dimethyl sulfide is a flammable liquid that boils at and has a characteristic disagreeable odor. It is a component of the smell produced from cooking of certain vegetables, notably maize, cabbage, beetroot, and seafoods. It is also an indication of bacterial contamination in malt production and brewing. It is a breakdown product of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and is also produced by the bacterial metabolism of methanethiol.\n\nDMS originates primarily from DMSP, a major secondary metabolite in some marine algae. DMS is the most abundant biological sulfur compound emitted to the atmosphere. Emission occurs over the oceans by phytoplankton. DMS is also produced naturally by bacterial transformation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) waste that is disposed of into sewers, where it can cause environmental odor problems.\n\nDMS is oxidized in the marine atmosphere to various sulfur-containing compounds, such as sulfur dioxide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulfone, methanesulfonic acid and sulfuric acid. Among these compounds, sulfuric acid has the potential to create new aerosols which act as cloud condensation nuclei. Through this interaction with cloud formation, the massive production of atmospheric DMS over the oceans may have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. The CLAW hypothesis suggests that in this manner DMS may play a role in planetary homeostasis.\n\nMarine phytoplankton also produce dimethyl sulfide, and DMS is also produced by bacterial cleavage of extracellular DMSP. DMS has been characterized as the \"smell of the sea\", though it would be more accurate to say that DMS is a component of the smell of the sea, others being chemical derivatives of DMS, such as oxides, and yet others being algal pheromones such as dictyopterenes.\n\nDimethyl sulfide also is an odorant emitted by kraft pulping mills, and it is a byproduct of Swern oxidation.\n\nDimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide have been found among the volatiles given off by the fly-attracting plant known as dead-horse arum (\"Helicodiceros muscivorus\"). Those compounds are components of an odor like rotting meat, which attracts various pollinators that feed on carrion, such as many species of flies.\n\nDimethyl sulfide is normally present at very low levels in healthy people, namely <7nM in blood, <3 nM in urine and 0.13 – 0.65 nM on expired breath.\n\nAt pathologically dangerous concentrations, this is known as dimethylsulfidemia. This condition is associated with blood borne halitosis and dimethylsulfiduria.\n\nIn people with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis), high levels of dimethyl sulfide may be present the breath, leading to an unpleasant smell (fetor hepaticus).\n\nDimethyl sulfide has a characteristic smell commonly described as cabbage-like. It becomes highly disagreeable at even quite low concentrations. Some reports claim that DMS has a low olfactory threshold that varies from 0.02 to 0.1 ppm between different persons, but it has been suggested that the odor attributed to dimethyl sulfide may in fact be due to di- and polysulfides and thiol impurities, since the odor of dimethyl sulfide is much less disagreeable after it is freshly washed with saturated aqueous mercuric chloride. Dimethyl sulfide is also available as a food additive to impart a savory flavor; in such use, its concentration is low. Beetroot, asparagus, cabbage, corn and seafoods produce dimethyl sulfide when cooked. \n\nDimethyl sulfide is also produced by marine planktonic micro-organisms such as the coccolithophores and so is one of the main components responsible for the characteristic odor of sea water aerosols, which make up a part of sea air. In the Victorian era, before DMS was discovered, the origin of sea air's 'bracing' aroma was attributed to ozone.\n\nIn industry dimethyl sulfide is produced by treating hydrogen sulfide with excess methanol over an aluminium oxide catalyst.\n\nDimethyl sulfide has been used in petroleum refining to pre-sulfide hydrodesulfurization catalysts, although other disulfides or polysulfides are preferred and easier to handle. It is used as a presulfiding agent to control the formation of coke and carbon monoxide in ethylene production. DMS is also used in a range of organic syntheses, including as a reducing agent in ozonolysis reactions. It also has a use as a food flavoring component. It can also be oxidized to dimethyl sulfoxide, (DMSO), which is an important industrial solvent.\n\nThe largest single commercial producer of DMS in the world is Gaylord Chemical Corporation. The Chevron Phillips Chemical company is also a major manufacturer of DMS. CP Chem produces this material at their facilities in Borger, Texas, USA and Tessenderlo, Belgium.\n\nDimethyl sulfide finds a niche use as a displaceable ligand in chloro(dimethyl sulfide)gold(I) and other coordination compounds. Dimethyl sulfide is also used in the ozonolysis of alkenes, reducing the intermediate trioxolane and oxidizing to DMSO, an important polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. .\n\nThe process: alkene + ozone + DMS → aldehyde(1) + aldehyde(2) + DMSO\n\nDimethyl sulfide is highly flammable and an eye and skin irritant. It is harmful if swallowed. It has an unpleasant odor at even extremely low concentrations. Its ignition temperature is 205 °C.\n\n\n"}

Throughout the history of Africa, Africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. In some cases, broader regional styles can be identified, such as the Sudano-Sahelian architecture of West Africa. A common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.\n\nAfrican architecture has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. Western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.\n\nAfrican architecture uses a wide range of materials, including thatch, stick/wood, mud, mudbrick, rammed earth, and stone. These material preferences vary by region: North Africa for stone and rammed earth, the Horn of Africa for stone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.\n\nProbably the most famous class of structure in all Africa, the Pyramids of Egypt remain one of the world's greatest early architectural achievements, regardless of practicality and origins in a funerary context. Egyptian architectural traditions also favored the building of vast temple complexes.\n\nLittle is known of ancient architecture south and west of the Sahara. Harder to date than the pyramids are the monoliths around the Cross River, which have geometric or human designs. The vast number of Senegambian stone circles is also evidence of an emerging architecture. \n\nEgypt's achievements in architecture included temples, enclosed cities, canals, and dams.\n\nThousands of pre-Christian tombs were left by the Berbers, whose architecture was unique to northwest Africa. The most famous was the Tomb of the Christian Woman in western Algeria. This structure consists of columns, a dome, and spiral pathways that lead to a single chamber.\n\nMassive Amazigh pisé mudbrick buildings date from 110 BCE. A common feature of Amazigh architecture is the \"agadir\", or fortified granary. Cities such as Ceuta, Chellah, and Volubilis were influenced by Phoenician and Roman architecture.\n\nNubian architecture is one of the most ancient in the world. The earliest style of Nubian architecture includes the speos, structures carved out of solid rock under the A-Group culture (3700-3250 BCE). Egyptians borrowed and made extensive use of the process at Speos Artemidos and Abu Simbel. A-Group culture led eventually to the C-Group culture, which began building using light, supple materials—animal skins and wattle and daub—with larger structures of mudbrick later becoming the norm.\n\nThe C-Group culture was related to that of the city of Kerma, which was settled around 2400 BC. It was a walled city containing religious buildings, large circular dwellings, a palace, and well-laid-out roads. On the east side of the city, a funerary temple and chapel were laid out. It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most enduring structures was the Deffufa, a mudbrick temple, on top of which ceremonies were performed.\n\nBetween 1500 and 1085 BC, Egypt conquered and dominated Nubia, which brought about the Napatan phase of Nubian history: the birth of the Kingdom of Kush. Kush was immensely influenced by Egypt and eventually conquered Egypt. During this phase, we see the building of numerous pyramids and temples. Gebel Barkal, in the town of Napata, was a significant site, where Kushite pharaohs received legitimacy.\n\nThirteen temples and two palaces have been excavated in Napata, which has yet to be fully excavated. Sudan contains 223 Nubian pyramids, more numerous but smaller than the Egyptian pyramids, at three major sites: El Kurru, Nuri, and Meroe. The elements of Nubian pyramids, built for kings and queens, included steep walls, a chapel facing east, a stairway facing east, and a chamber accessed via the stairway. The Meroe site has the most pyramids and is considered the largest archaeological site in the world. Around AD 350, the area was invaded by the Kingdom of Aksum and the Napatan kingdom collapsed.\n\nAksumite architecture flourished in the Ethiopian region, as attested by the numerous Aksumite influences in and around the medieval churches of Lalibela, where stelae (\"hawilt\"s) and, later, entire churches were carved out of single blocks of rock. Other monumental structures include massive underground tombs often located beneath stelae. Other well-known structures employing monolithic construction include the Tomb of the False Door, and the tombs of Kaleb and Gebre Mesqel in Axum.\n\nMost structures, however—such as palaces, villas, commoner's houses, and other churches and monasteries—were built of alternating layers of stone and wood. Some examples of this style had whitewashed exteriors and/or interiors, such as the medieval 12th-century monastery of Yemrehanna Krestos, which was built in Aksumite style. Contemporary houses were one-room stone structures, two-storey square houses, or roundhouses of sandstone with basalt foundations. Villas were generally two-to-four storeys tall and had sprawling rectangular plans (cf. Dungur ruins). A good example of still-standing Aksumite architecture is the monastery of Debre Damo from the 6th century.\n\nTichitt Walata is the oldest surviving collection of settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone-base settlement south of the Sahara. It was built by the Soninke people and is thought to be the precursor of the Ghana empire. It was settled by agropastoral people around 2000–300 BCE, which makes it almost 1000 years older than previously thought. One finds well-laid-out streets and fortified compounds, all made out of skilled stone masonry. In all, there were 500 settlements.\n\nNok culture artifacts—located on the Jos Plateau in Nigeria, between the Niger River and Benue River—have been dated as far back as 790 BCE. The excavation of the Nok settlement in Samun Dikiya shows a tendency to build on hill tops and mountain peaks. However, Nok settlements have not been extensively excavated.\n\nSao civilization sites of walled-cities are in the Lake Chad region, along the Chari River; the oldest site—at Zilum, Chad—dates to at least the first millennium.\n\nGobarau Mosque is believed to have been completed during the reign of Muhammadu Korau (1398–1408), the first Muslim king of Katsina. Originally built as the central mosque of Katsina town, it was later also used as a school. By the beginning of the 16th century, Katsina had become a very important commercial and academic center in Hausaland, and Gobarau Mosque had grown into a famed Islamic institution of higher learning. Gobarau continued to be Katsina's central mosque until the beginning of the 19th century AD.\n\nSeveral societies in pre-colonial Nigeria built structures from earth and stone. In general, these structures were primarily defensive, repelling invaders from other tribes, but many settlements put spiritual elements into their construction. These defensive structures were primarily constructed from earth, occasionally plastered. \n\nDump ramparts consist of an outer ditch and inner bank and can span from 1/2 meter to 20 meters across in the largest settlements such as Benin and Sungbo's Eredo. Coursed mud walls in the Guinea and Sudan savannas were laid in layers of mud. Each layer of mud would be held in place by wooden framing, allowed to dry, and built on top of. At the most significant settlement in Koso, these walls averaged 6 meters in height, tapering from 2 meters thick at the base to 1/2 meter thick at the top. Tubali walls in northern Nigeria have two components: sun-dried mud bricks held together with mud mortar. Walls in this style have a tendency to deteriorate in wetter climates.\n\nThese mud constructions were usually plastered with mud mixed with other materials. The defensive purpose of this was to create a smoother, unscalable surface to help repel attackers. However, some plaster has been found with blood, bone remains, gold dust, oil, and straw mixed in. Some of these materials were functional, adding strength, while others had spiritual meanings, possibly to defend against evil spirits.\n\nBenin City in particular had sophisticated house and urban planning. Houses had several rooms and were usually roofed, enclosing private quarters, sacred spaces, and rooms for receiving guests. Usually, multiple houses would enclose a shared courtyard. When it rained, the house roofs would collect water into a space in the courtyard for later use. Houses would have public frontage along long, straight roads. The city had markets and the chief's palace in the center of the city, with dominant and subordinate roads leading outwards. HM Stanely, quoted in Asomani-Boateng, Raymond (2011-11), described the roads as \"...fenced with tall [water cane] neatly set very close together in uniform rows...\" possibly for privacy.\n\nMore sophisticated construction methods include stone and brick constructions, with and without mortar, plaster, and accompanying defensive structures. Fired brick constructions were observed in settlements in northeast Nigeria, such as historic Kanuri buildings. Many of the bricks have since been removed for new constructions. Laterite block walls with clay mortar were found in northwest Nigeria, possibly inspired by Songhai constructions. Walls built from stone without mortar have been found where societies could obtain sufficient stone, most notably in Sukur. None of these constructions have been observed with additional plastering.\n\nThe Sukur World Heritage Site is especially significant, with extensive terraces, walls, and infrastructure. Walls separate homes, animal pens, and granaries, while terraces often include spiritual items such as sacred trees or ceramic shrines. Early iron foundries were also present, usually placed close to the homes of their owners.\n\nBroadly, three styles of residential architecture can be identified in indigenous Nigerian architecture, relating to the people groups which developed them.\n\n\nThese elements are believed to affect present-day residential house design, especially when designating spaces as public, semi-public, semi-private, or private. \n\nThe Islamic conquest of North Africa saw the development of Islamic architecture in the region, including such famous structures as the Great Mosque of Kairouan or the Cairo Citadel. The \"sahn\" is a prominent early feature of Islamic architecture.\n\nAround 1000 AD, cob (tabya) first appears in the Maghreb and al-Andalus.\n\nIslamic architecture developed in Morocco under the Idrisid dynasty, with structures such as the University of al-Qarawiyyin. The Almoravid dynasty united northwest Africa and Iberia under one empire, and brought Andalusi architects to North Africa. Some features of Moroccan Islamic architecture are the \"riad\", square-based minarets, \"tadelakt\" plaster, and decorative features such as arabesque and zellige.\n\nUnder the Saadi dynasty, Marble from Carrara, bought with Moroccan sugar, was used in the furnishing of palaces and mosques.\n\nSomali architecture has a rich and diverse tradition of designing and engineering different types of construction, such as masonry, castles, citadels, fortresses, mosques, temples, aqueducts, lighthouses, towers and tombs, during the ancient, medieval, and early modern periods in Somalia. It also encompasses the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Western designs in modern times.\nIn ancient Somalia, pyramidical structures known in Somali as \"taalo\" were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these dry stone monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of dressed stone similar to the ones in Ancient Egypt, and there are examples of courtyards, and large stone walls, such as the Wargaade Wall, enclosing settlements.\n\nThe peaceful introduction of Islam in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from Arabia and Persia, which stimulated a shift in construction from dry stone, and other related materials, to coral stone, sun-dried bricks, and the widespread use of limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs, such as mosques, were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.\nThroughout the medieval period, the monolithic influences of Aksumite architecture persisted, with its influence felt strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially during the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially in the northernmost region of Tigray, which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as Adadi Maryam (15th century), about south of Addis Abeba.\n\nThe most famous examples of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Although later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous king Lalibela (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and \"Ethiopisant\" David Phillipson postulates that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 AD, originally as a fortress but later turned into a church.\n\nAt Kumbi Saleh, locals lived in dome-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by al-Bakri), one of which was for Friday prayer. The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long and forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase, with paintings on the walls and chambers filled with sculpture.\n\nSahelian architecture initially grew from the two cities of Djenné and Timbuktu. The Sankore Mosque, constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the Great Mosque of Djenné.\n\nAshanti architecture from Ghana is perhaps best known from the reconstruction at Kumasi. Its key features are courtyard-based buildings, and walls with striking reliefs in brightly painted mud plaster. An example of a shrine can be seen at Bawjiase in Ghana. Four rectangular rooms, constructed from wattle and daub, lie around a courtyard. Animal designs mark the walls, and palm leaves cut to a tiered shape provide the roof.\n\nThe Yoruba surrounded their settlements with massive mud walls. Their buildings had a similar plan to the Ashanti shrines, but with verandahs around the court. The walls were of puddled mud and palm oil. The most famous of the Yoruba fortifications, and the second largest wall edifice in Africa, is Sungbo's Eredo, a structure that was built in honour of a traditional oloye by the name of Bilikisu Sungbo, in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. The structure is made up of sprawling mud walls among the valleys that surrounded the town of Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State. Sungbo's Eredo is the largest pre-colonial monument in Africa, larger than the Great Pyramids or Great Zimbabwe.\n\nKanem-Bornu's capital city, Birni N'Gazargamu, may have had a population of 200,000. It had four mosques, which could hold up to 12,000 worshippers. It was surrounded by a wall more than in circumference. Many large streets extended from the esplanade and connected to 660 roads. The main buildings were built with red brick. Other buildings were built with straw and adobe.\n\nThe important Hausa Kingdoms city state of Kano was surrounded by a wall of reinforced ramparts of stone and bricks. Kano contained a citadel near which the royal court resided. Individual residences were separated by earthen walls. The higher the status of the resident the more elaborate the wall. The entrance-way was maze-like to keep women secluded. Inside, near the entrance, were the abodes of unmarried women. Further on were slave quarters.\n\nThe rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. Benin City, destroyed during the Benin Expedition of 1897, was a large complex of homes in coursed mud, with hipped roofs of shingles or palm leaves. The palace contained a sequence of ceremonial rooms and was decorated with brass plaques. The Walls of Benin City were the world's largest man-made structure. Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:\n\nWith a population of more than 30,000, Mbanza Congo was the capital of the Kingdom of Kongo. The city sat atop a cliff, with a river running below through a forested valley. The king's dwelling was described as an enclosure, a mile-and-a-half in extent, with walled pathways, courtyard, gardens, decorated huts, and palisades. An early explorer described it as looking like a Cretan labyrinth.\n\nThe capital of the Kuba Kingdom was surrounded by a fence. Inside the fence were roads, a walled royal palace, and urban buildings. The palace was rectangular and in the center of the city.\n\nThe Luba tended to cluster in small villages, with rectangular houses facing a single street. \"Kilolo\", patrilineal chieftains, headed the local village government, under the protection of the king. Cultural life centered around the \"kitenta\", the royal compound, which later came to be a permanent capital. The kitenta drew artists, poets, musicians and craftsmen, spurred by royal and court patronage.\n\nMusumba the capital of the Kingdom of Lunda, was from the Kasai River, in open woodland, between two rivers apart. The city was surrounded by fortified earthen ramparts and dry moats. The compound of the \"Mwato Yamvo\" (sovereign ruler) was surrounded by large fortifications of double-layered tree, or wood, ramparts. Musumba had multiple courtyards with designated functions, straight roads, and public squares. Its cleanliness was noted by European observers.\n\nThe Eastern Lunda dwelling of the Kazembe was described as containing fenced roads a mile long. The enclosing walls were made of grass, 12 to 13 span in height. The enclosed roads led to a rectangular hut opened on the west side. In the center was a wooden base with a statue on top of about 3 span in height.\n\nThe Maravi people built bridges (\"uraro\") of bamboo because of changing river depths. Bamboo was placed parallel to each other and tied together by bark (\"maruze\"). One end of the bridge would be tied to a tree. The bridge would curve downward.\n\nEngaruka is a ruined settlement on the slopes of Mount Ngorongoro in northern Tanzania. Seven stone-terraced villages comprised the settlement. A complex structure of stone channels along the mountain's base was used to dike, dam, and level surrounding river waters for irrigation of individual plots of land. Some of these irrigation channels were several kilometers long. The channels irrigated a total area of .\n\nBurundi never had a fixed capital. The closest thing to it was a royal hill. When the king moved, his new location became the \"insago\". The compound itself was enclosed inside a high fence and had two entrances. One was for herders and herds. The other was to the royal palace, which was itself surrounded by a fence. The royal palace had three royal courtyards, each serving a particular function: one for herders, one as a sanctuary, and one encompassed by kitchen and granary.\n\nNyanza was the royal capital of Rwanda. The king's residence, the Ibwami, was built on a hill. Surrounding hills were occupied by permanent or temporary dwellings. These dwellings were round huts surrounded by big yards and tall hedges to separate the compounds. The \"Rugo\", the royal compound, was encircled by reed fences encompassing thatched houses. The houses for the king's entourage were carpeted with mats and had clay hearths in the center. For the king and his wife, the royal house was close to 200-100 yards in length and looked like a huge maze of connected huts and granaries. It had one entrance that lead to a large public square called the \"karubanda\".\n\nIn western Uganda, there are numerous earthworks near the Katonga River. These earthworks have been attributed to the Empire of Kitara. The most famous, Bigo Bya Mugenyi, is about . The ditch was dug by cutting through of solid bedrock and earth. The earthwork rampart was about high. It is not certain whether its function was for defense or pastoral use. Little is known about the Ugandan earthworks.\n\nInitially, the hilltop capital, or \"kibuga\", of Buganda would be moved to a new hill with each new ruler, or \"Kabaka\". In the late 19th century, a permanent kibuga of Buganda was established at Mengo Hill. The capital, 1.5 miles across, was divided into quarters corresponding to provinces, with each chief building dwellings for his wife, slaves, dependents and visitors. Large plots of land were available for planting bananas and fruits. Roads were wide and well maintained.\n\nThe Christianization of Nubia began in the 6th century. Its most representative architecture consists of churches, whose design is based on Byzantine basilicas, but which are relatively small and made of mud bricks. Vernacular architecture of the Christian period is scarce. Soba is the only city that has been excavated. Its structures are made of sun-dried bricks, the same as today, except for an arch. During the Fatimid phase of Islam, Nubia became Arabized. Its most import mosque was the Mosque of Derr.\n\nFarther south, increased trade with Arab merchants, and the development of ports, saw the birth of Swahili architecture. An outgrowth of indigenous Bantu settlements, one of the earliest examples is the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, lying west of Kilwa, built about 1245. As with many other early Swahili buildings, coral rag was the main construction material, and even the roof was constructed by attaching coral to timbers. The palace at Kilwa Kisiwani was a two-story tower, in a walled enclosure. Other notable structures from the period include the pillar tombs of Malindi and Mnarani in Kenya and elsewhere, originally made of coral rag, and later from stone. Later examples include Zanzibar's Stone Town, with its famous carved doors and the Great Mosque of Kilwa.\n\nCape Dutch architecture is traditional Afrikaner architecture and is one of the most distinctive types of settler architecture in the world. It was developed during the century-and-a-half that the Cape was a Dutch colony. Even by the end of that period, the early 19th-century, the colony was inhabited by fewer than fifty thousand people, spread over an area roughly the size of the United Kingdom. The Cape Dutch–style buildings showed a remarkable consistency and were clearly related to rural architecture in northwestern Europe but equally clearly having its own unmistakable African character and features.\n\nMapungubwe is considered the most socially complex society in southern Africa and the first southern African culture to display economic differentiation. The elite lived separately in a mountain settlement made of sandstone. It was the precursor to Great Zimbabwe. Large amounts of dirt were carried to the top of the hill. At the bottom of the hill was a natural amphitheater, and at the top an elite graveyard. There were only two pathways to the top, one following a narrow steep cleft along the side of the hill of which observers at the top had a clear view.\n\nGreat Zimbabwe was the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. It was constructed and expanded for more than 300 years in a local style that eschewed rectilinearity for flowing curves. Neither the first nor the last of some 300 similar complexes located on the Zimbabwean plateau, Great Zimbabwe is set apart by the large scale of its structures. Its most formidable edifice, commonly referred to as the Great Enclosure, has dressed stone walls as high as extending for approximately , making it the largest ancient structure south of the Sahara. Houses within the enclosure were circular and constructed of wattle and daub, with conical thatched roofs.\n\nKhami was the capital of the Torwa State. It was the successor to Great Zimbabwe and where the techniques of Great Zimbabwe were further refined and developed. Elaborate walls were constructed by connecting carefully cut stones to form terraced hills.\n\nSotho–Tswana architecture represents the other stone-building tradition of southern Africa, centered in the transvaal, highveld north and south of the Vaal. Numerous large stonewalled enclosures and stone-house foundations have been found in the region. Tswana, the capital of the \"Kwena\" (ruler), was a stone-walled town as large as the capital of Eastern Lunda.\n\nZulu Architecture was constructed with more perishable materials. Dome-shaped huts typically come to mind when one thinks of Zulu dwellings, but later on their design evolved into dome over cylinder-shaped walls. Zulu capital cities were elliptical in plan. The exterior was lined with a durable wood palisade. Domed huts, in rows of 6 to 8, stood just inside the palisade. In the center was the kraal, used by the king to examine his soldiers, hold cattle, or conduct ceremonies. It was an empty circular area at the center of the capital, enclosed by a less durable interior palisade, compared to the exterior. The entrance to the city was opposite to the fortified royal enclosure called the \"Isigodlo\".\n\nThe Southeast Asian origins of the first settlers of Madagascar are reflected in the island's architecture, typified by rectangular dwellings topped with peaked roofs and often built on short stilts. Coastal dwellings, generally made of plant materials, are more like those of East Africa; those of the central highlands tend to be constructed in cob or brick. The introduction of brick-making, by European missionaries in the 19th century, led to the emergence of a distinctly Malagasy architectural style that blends the norms of traditional wooden aristocratic homes with European details.\n\nThe fortress of ǁKhauxaǃnas, built by the Oorlam in southeastern Namibia, included a wall that was in length and in height. It was built with stone slabs and displays features of both the Zimbabwean and Transvaal-Free-State styles of stone construction.\n\nIn the early modern period, Ethiopia's absorption of diverse new influences—such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian styles—began with the arrival of Portuguese Jesuit missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in its fight against Adal, and the Jesuits came hoping to convert the country.\n\nSome Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during Ethiopia's war with the Ottoman Empire (see Habesh), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally hard to defensible because of its numerous ambas or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, gained little tactical use from these structures, in contrast to advantages they bestowed when placed on the flat terrain of Europe and other areas; and so Ethiopia had not nurtured the tradition. Castle building, especially around the Lake Tana region, began with the reign of Sarsa Dengel; and subsequent emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the \"Fasil Ghebbi\" (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital, Gondar (1635).\n\nEmperor Susenyos (r. 1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication. During this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), Jesuit and local masons, some of whom were Beta Israel, and adopted their styles. With the reign of his son Fasilides, most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, especially, and influenced modern 19th-century-and-later styles.\n\nEarly European colonies on the West African coast built large forts, as can be seen at Elmina Castle, Cape Coast Castle, Christiansborg, Fort Jesus, and elsewhere. These were usually plain, with little ornamentation, but with more adornment at Dixcove Fort. Other embellishments were gradually accreted, with the style inspiring later buildings such as Lamu Fort and the stone palace of Kumasi.\n\nBy the late 19th century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European eclecticism and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles. Examples of colonial towns from this era survive at Saint-Louis, Grand-Bassam, Swakopmund, Cape Town, Luanda. A few buildings were pre-fabricated in Europe and shipped over for erection. This European tradition continued well into the 20th century, with the construction of European-style manor houses, such as Shiwa Ng'andu in what is now Zambia, or the Boer homesteads in South Africa, and with many town buildings.\n\nThe revival of interest in traditional styles can be traced to Cairo in the early 19th century. This had spread to Algiers and Morocco by the early 20th century, from which time colonial buildings across the continent began to consist of pastiches of traditional African architecture, the Jamia Mosque in Nairobi being a typical example. In some cases, architects attempted to mix local and European styles, such as at Bagamoyo.\n\nThe effect of modern architecture began to be felt in the 1920s and 1930s. Le Corbusier designed several never-built schemes for Algeria, including ones for Nemours and for the reconstruction of Algiers. Elsewhere, Steffen Ahrends was active in South Africa, and Ernst May in Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\nElie Azagury became the first Moroccan modernist architect in the 1950s. The —at first led by Michel Écochard, director of urban planning under the French Protectorate—was active building public housing in the Hay Mohammedi neighborhood of Casablanca that provided a \"culturally specific living tissue\" for laborers and migrants from the countryside. Sémiramis, (Honeycomb), and Carrières Centrales were some of the first examples of this Vernacular Modernism. The French-Moroccan architect Jean-François Zevaco also built experimental modernist works in Morocco.\n\nItalian futurist architecture heavily influenced the designs of Asmara. Planned villages were constructed in Libya and Italian East Africa, including the new town of Tripoli, all utilising modern designs.\n\nAfter 1945, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew extended their work on British schools into Ghana, and also designed the University of Ibadan. The reconstruction of Algiers offered more opportunities, with Sacred Heart Cathedral of Algiers, and universities by Oscar Niemeyer, Kenzo Tange, , and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. But modern architecture in this sense largely remained the preserve of European architects until the 1960s, one notable exception being in South Africa, which built homes inspired by Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier.\n\nA number of new cities were built following the end of colonialism, while others were greatly expanded. Perhaps the best known example is that of Abidjan, where the majority of buildings were still designed by high-profile non-African architects. In Yamoussoukro, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro is an example of a desire for monumentality in these new cities, but Arch 22 in the old Gambian capital of Banjul displays the same bravado.\n\nExperimental designs have also appeared, most notably the Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe. With an advanced form of natural air-conditioning, this building was designed to respond precisely to Harare's climate and needs, rather than import less suitable designs. Neo-vernacular architecture continues, for instance with the Great Mosque of Niono or Hassan Fathy's New Gourna.\n\nOther notable structures of recent years have been some of the world's largest dams. The Aswan High Dam and Akosombo Dam hold back the world's largest reservoirs. In recent years, there has also been renewed bridge building in many nations, while the Trans-Gabon Railway is perhaps the last of the great railways to be constructed.\n\n\n"}

It offers a level of detail not afforded by the standard feature-film screenplay format. This makes it especially useful for describing short film, animation and short sequence ideas.\n\nIts structure is focused on action rather than thought. This allows screenwriters to organise their narrative ideas in a concise manner that is conducive to screen presentation. It prevents authors from describing non-tangible, subjective elements that are unable to be effectively represented in screen form.\n\nBeatscripts are used as the starting-point for generating storyboards and shooting-scripts. While beats are used to describe action, shots are used to describe the visual screen presentation of action.\n\nThe relationship between individual beats and shots is not direct. In situations, where an event is significant in a sequence, a single beat might equate to a single shot (and is likely to be framed as a close-up). Whereas a series of beats might describe a general idea, these beats might collectively equate to a single shot (which is likely to be framed as a long-shot). The specific visual treatment of beatscript ideas is usually determined by the cinematographer or director (which on small projects is usually the same person).\n\n"}
{"id": "2249398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249398", "title": "Space Stars", "text": "Space Stars\n\nSpace Stars is a 60-minute Saturday morning animated program block produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and broadcast on NBC from September 12, 1981, to September 11, 1982.\n\n\"Space Stars\" was narrated by Keene Curtis and featured five cartoon segments each week:\n\nThe cartoons would occasionally cross over into one another. \"Space Ghost\" and \"The Herculoids\" both had their own respective series in the 1960s. \"Teen Force\" and \"Space Ace and the Space Mutts\" are both new segments, although the Astro character was the family dog from \"The Jetsons\".\n\nThe opening title narration was provided by Michael Rye and consisted of the following:\n\nA total of 22 episodes were produced for \"Space Ghost\" (two segments aired each week), featuring a new assortment of villains including an evil version of Space Ghost called Space Spectre (who came from an alternate universe). The Phantom Cruiser and its Scout Ship were also given sleeker and more modernized looks. Space Ghost often came to the aid of the Herculoids and vice versa (as in the original \"Space Ghost\" series' \"Council of Doom\" storyline, where they met once). They also frequently crossed paths with the Teen Force, and it appeared that Jan and Teen Force member Kid Comet were dating as well. Elektra made several appearances as well. Gary Owens reprised his role as Space Ghost, but Tim Matheson was replaced by Steve Spears as the voice of Jace, Ginny Tyler was replaced by Alexandra Stoddart as the voice of Jan, and Don Messick was replaced by Frank Welker as the vocal effects for Blip.\n\nAs a departure from the original series, this incarnation of \"The Herculoids\" had its roots in science fiction and had story direction and content similar to \"Jonny Quest\" and \"Space Ghost\". This series takes place on a far-away planet named Quasar in the land of Amzot (the planet was only named as such in this series, though Amzot was first mentioned by name in \"The Time Creatures\", an episode of the original series). Eleven episodes were produced. Mike Road and Virginia Gregg reprised their roles as Zandor and Tara, respectively. Ted Eccles was replaced by Sparky Marcus as Dorno. Mike Road and Don Messick also reprised their roles as the voices of the Herculoids.\n\n\"Teen Force\" focused on three superhumanly gifted young students who hail from an unknown alternate universe which is located beyond the confines of the mysterious Black Hole X, which serves as a gateway into the universe in which the other main characters from \"Space Stars\" exist.\n\nThe Teen Force consists of Kid Comet, who possesses tremendous levels of superhuman speed, enabling him move at speeds exceeding the speed of light, and can even move quickly enough to travel through time; Moleculad, who can control his molecular structure for various effects; and Elektra, who possesses the psionic disciplines of telepathy, telekenesis, and teleportation. Accompanying them are a pair of diminutive blue-skinned aliens named Plutem and Glax, also known as the Astromites. Their principal enemy in the series is Uglor, a mutant native and tyrannical ruler of the planet Uris (whose inhabitants are a race of evolved simians) in Galaxy Q-2. Uglor's mutation granted him bird-like wings and the ability to generate destructive energy blasts from his bionic eyes, which allowed him to see through Space Ghost's Inviso-Power and Elektra's telepathic illusions.\n\n\"Space Ace and the Space Mutts\" features Astro, the family dog from \"The Jetsons\". He teams up with two other dogs named Cosmo and Dipper, led by their human leader Space Ace. Together, the trio act as galactic police officers and travel through outer space. Don Messick reprised his role as Astro.\n\n\"Space Stars Finale\" was the last segment where Space Ghost, the Herculoids, the Teen Force and Space Ace and the Space Mutts team up to battle the scourges of the universe.\n\nIn syndication as a 30-minute series, USA Network had one segment each of \"Space Ghost\", \"Teen Force\" and \"The Herculoids\", but the \"Space Ace and the Space Mutts\" segments were never shown.\n\nThe \"Space Ghost\", \"The Herculoids\" and \"Space Ace and the Space Mutts\" segments have been seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang, but not the \"Teen Force\" segments. Furthermore, the series has never been shown in its entirety on Cartoon Network or Boomerang. Currently, these shorts are only broadcast on occasion as an interstitial segment between shows on Boomerang.\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Warner Archive released \"Space Stars: The Complete Series\" on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2249399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249399", "title": "Metro Rapid", "text": "Metro Rapid\n\nMetro Rapid is a local express bus service in Los Angeles County, California with bus rapid transit characteristics. It operates in mixed traffic environments and has fewer stops than the Metro Local service. The system is mainly operated by Metro. Two routes are operated by Big Blue Bus, one by Culver CityBus and one by Torrance Transit. The Rapid program speeds up travel time for passengers, complementing the Metro Local bus network operated by the Metro as well as other bus routes operated by smaller agencies.\n\nMetro Rapid buses are distinguished by their prominent red color. Based on availability of equipment, units in non-Metro Rapid livery may be placed into service on lines that normally use Metro Rapid buses.\n\nTo speed up travel times, buses are equipped with special transmitter devices that send a signal to traffic lights, which cause them to favor the bus by holding green lights longer and shortening red lights. Metro Rapid buses also stop less frequently than Metro Local buses, with Rapid stops located only at major intersections and transfer points. The frequency of Metro Rapid buses is increased as well, as more buses on a line translates to less wait time at each station. All Metro Rapid buses are low-floor CNG buses for faster boarding and alighting.\n\nAs a result of a recent federal court consent decree ruling, beginning in June 2006 almost all Rapid routes began operating from at least 5 am to 9 pm, five days a week, with a maximum of 10-minute peak headways and 20-minute midday and evening headways. Some Rapid routes operate on weekends as well.\n\nThe Metro Rapid Program was implemented in June 2000-December 2002 with the goal of improving bus speeds within urbanized Los Angeles County. Lines 720 (Wilshire), 745 (Broadway), 754 (Vermont) and 750 (Ventura) were the pilot routes of the program. Metro claims travel times were reduced by as much as 29%.\n\nMetro Rapid buses are distinguished by their red and silver livery. Some Rapid stops are equipped with \"NextBus\" technology which indicates the wait time before the next bus arrives. NextBus displays were installed mostly at stops on Lines 720 and 750.\n\nMetro Rapid Lines 720, 770 and 780 are the only lines that complement multiple lines (the 720 runs alongside the 18 and 20; 770 runs alongside 68 and 70; and the 780 runs alongside the 180, 181 and 217); Lines 720 and 780 are the longest routes in the Metro Rapid system. They take roughly 2 hours from start to end during rush hours. Also, line 720 is the most frequent of all Rapids. In the morning rush hour, the Rapid 720 ranges from every 2–10 minutes.\nA year after Metro introduced SmartBus technology on most of their buses, marquees were modified on most Metro Rapid buses in which the \"STOP REQUESTED\" portion scrolls across the marquee instead of staying in place and \"PLEASE USE REAR EXIT\" scrolls slowly. Months later, marquees were switched back to their original format.\n\nThe fare is the same as other Metro bus and rail service. Routes are numbered in the 700 series (7xx).\n\nOn February 2020, Metro announced their NextGen Bus Plan that proposed an elimination of the majority of the Metro Rapid lines and merge them into their Metro Local counterpart. All Metro Rapid routes, except for Lines 720 and 754, will be discontinued, while the remaining Rapid lines will serve as rush hour routes and Line 761 will return with a new terminal to Sylmar Metrolink Station.\n\nCritics see the Metro Rapid system as not sufficient to meet Los Angeles' growing transit needs. Limited funds, they say, would be better spent on extending the region's rail network. Rapid buses do not have the capacity or efficiency of light- or heavy-rail technology.\n\nOther critics claim that Metro Rapid is a triumph of marketing over substance. For many years, Metro and its predecessor, the SCRTD, operated \"limited\"-stop routes, which were similar to Metro Rapid service in the middle of their routes (serving only transfer points and major stops), but made local stops at each end. Rapid buses do not change traffic signals outside of the City of Los Angeles because only the City has tied the transponders to the signal network. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works is working on rectifying the problem for all the other cities where Rapid buses pass through, but individual signals have to be reprogrammed to give signal priority to Rapid buses. In addition, only Rapid-branded buses have transponders, which causes problems when not enough Rapid buses are available (or conversely, when Rapid-branded buses are used on Local service).\n\nAnother complaint concerns the placement of Local and Rapid stops at separate locations at the same intersection. This was done to eliminate the backing up of buses at stops, but has resulted in a dangerous move called the \"\"Rapid Bus Shuffle\"\", in which a rider waiting at a Local stop runs to a Rapid stop, or vice versa, if the other bus arrives first. In response, some Rapid stops are placed adjacent to Local bus stops.\n\nIn addition, civil rights organizations like the Bus Riders Union complain about cutbacks in Local service required to implement Rapid service. Generally, between 25 and 50% of Local service is cut and replaced by Rapid service. Thus, riders not living or working near a Rapid stop must walk a longer distance to an intersection with both Local and Rapid stops, or wait longer for a Local bus. The Special Master of the consent decree between Metro and the BRU has ordered that no more than 33% of the resources for Rapids come from Local service.\n\nMetro staff has never considered Metro Rapid a substitute for rail service, but is instead a pragmatic interim measure given current budgetary constraints.\n\nAnother major complaint is the lack of Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service on several of its high-volume routes like the 705, 710 and 740 where many patrons commute from inner-city suburbs, Downtown LA, or the South Bay to major cities for their jobs and local shopping.\n\nThe Metro Rapid fleet consists exclusively of low-floor buses manufactured by both North American Bus Industries, and New Flyer.\n\nFoothill Transit's Silver Streak made its debut on March 18, 2007, using the El Monte Busway and the San Bernardino Freeway. This route is not part of the official Metro Rapid program.\n\n"}
{"id": "2249409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249409", "title": "Chickenman (radio series)", "text": "Chickenman (radio series)\n\nChickenman was an American radio series created by Dick Orkin that spoofs comic book heroes, inspired by the mid-1960s \"Batman\" TV series. The series was created in 1966 on Chicago radio station WCFL, and was then syndicated widely, notably on Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War. According to public radio show, \"This American Life\", \"\"Chickenman\" first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969; nearly every day there would be a new episode. The episodes are each about one or two minutes in duration. The program’s distribution spread to over 1,500 radio stations. According to the people who syndicate \"Chickenman,\" it has been translated into German, into Dutch, into Swedish.\"\n\nIn the series, Benton Harbor, a shoe salesman at a large downtown Midland City department store, spends his weekends striking terrific terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere as that fantastic fowl, Chickenman. Or, at least, that's what he tells everyone. In reality, he mostly hangs around the Police Commissioner's office and irritates the Commissioner's secretary, Miss Helfinger.\n\nEach episode begins with an overly-dramatic theme, a four-note trumpet sound echoed with Benton Harbor's \"Buck-buck-buck-buuuuuck\" chicken call, which is followed by a rousing cry of \"\"Chicken-mannnn!\"\" and voices shouting, \"He's everywhere! He's everywhere!\" This tagline became a memorable catchphrase, especially because it's repeated again at the end of each episode, two and a half minutes later.\n\nMidway through the series, in 1973, Orkin added special weekend episodes called \"Chickenman vs. the Earth Polluters\". In 1976, a special LP was created by Orkin and Bert Berdis: \"Chickenman Returns\", and an updated radio show in 1977, \"Chickenman Returns for the Last Time Again.\"\n\nChickenman was created in 1966 by Dick Orkin, at the time a production director at WCFL in Chicago. WCFL's Program Director, Ken Draper, was inspired by the success of the \"Batman\" TV show, and asked Orkin to put together a two-and-a-half-minute comedy feature with a similarly \"camp\" sensibility.\n\nIn a 1996 article, Orkin explained, \"I was never clear about what 'camp' meant, except that I guess it had something to do with the sacredness of absolute values that, when extended to irrational limits, became just plain silly... Thank God I hadn't known 'camp' was later considered a literary technique, or that would have killed the doing of it for me.\"\n\nOrkin's \"Chickenman\" series was part of the late morning show hosted by Jim Runyon. Orkin played the male characters, including Benton Harbor and Police Commissioner Benjamin Norton. In a 1992 interview, Orkin admitted that Benton's character was \"a little cardboardy,\" and refuted the rumors that Benton roughly resembles Orkin's own character: \"This is, of course, nonsense. The resemblance is not even close to rough. It's precise.\"\n\nThe female characters on the show were performed by Jane Roberts, a Chicago theater actress who worked at WCFL as the traffic reporter. \"She would listen to municipal traffic channels and coordinate the information for airing on WCFL,\" Orkin recalls. \"She would put on a rather husky, sexy voice and play herself off as Trooper 36-24-36. Jane was the only 'female' talent I had available to me. And she was the best at what she did.\" Roberts' characters included the almost-unflappable Miss Helfinger, Chickenman's mother Mildred Harbor, his mother's oldest friend Emma Leckner, and Emma's attractive-and-still-single daughter Sadye.\n\nRunyon performed the narration, including a closing tag for each episode that memorably began with an astonished \"Well-l-l-l-l.\" According to Orkin, \"Jim was incredible, he would adlib an ending for each episode. Jim made the work enjoyable and fun — because we never knew what he was going to come up with. His big goal was to break us up at the ending and make us laugh.\"\n\nChickenman's rogues gallery includes the Choker, the Hummer, the Chicken-Plucker, the Dog Lady, Big Clyde Crushman, the Bear Lady, the Very Diabolical Rodney Farber (a childhood playmate who never forgave Benton Harbor for breaking his red wagon one Christmas Day), and the Couple From SHTICK (Secret Henchmen To Injure Crime Killers). Benton Harbor is prone to spoonerisms, such as \"I shall not rest while rime runs crampant in the streets of Midland City.\"\n\nChickenman roams Midland City seeking criminals in his yellow crime-fighting car, appropriately known as the Chicken Coupe. He has a secret headquarters, the Chicken Cave, accessible through a trap door in his bedroom closet. His armaments include the Geshtunkana Ray Gun, which is not lethal but makes the target \"geshtunkana\" for 24 hours. When Chickenman is busy, his mother Mildred fills in as \"the Maternal Marauder\", sometimes known as \"the Masked Mother\".\n\nAs the popularity of the show grew, Orkin created a production company: \"I only intended the Chickenman series to run for a period of two weeks — but obviously it lasted much longer — it went on for four or five months. Suddenly, a syndication company from Texas came in and asked if they could distribute the program nationally. Naturally, we said \"yes.\" It was then that we formed an actual company, at the station, to continue producing the series. Chickenman was produced under the station's production banner for the next five years, then I bought the show just prior to leaving WCFL in the early 1970s. I continued to produce and syndicate it on my own.\"\n\nThere was a follow up series named \"Amazon Ace\" produced under the name Camp Associates but also distributed by SPOT Productions which had distributed \"Chickenman\".\n\nIn 1973, Orkin's production company revived the series as \"Chickenman vs. the Earth-Polluters\", an ecology series in which the \"Fearless Feathered Fighter\" battles pollution in Midland City, organizing the BEAK (Beautiful Earth & Air Keepers) Patrol. A total of 52 episodes were recorded.\n\nIn 1977, Orkin produced \"Chickenman Returns for the Last Time Again\". The \"Wonderful White-Winged Warrior\" feels that time had passed him by and he decides to open a crime-fighting school to carry on his crusade. However, there is only one student: Leon Cablemouth (played by Orkin's then-partner, Bert Berdis). Orkin and Rich Koz co-authored several of the episodes, which numbered 65.\n\nIn 1995, Orkin brought Chickenman out of retirement for a 30th anniversary tribute episode on \"Poultry Slam 1995\", Episode 3 of the WBEZ public radio program \"This American Life\" (then called \"Your Radio Playhouse\"). In \"Chickenman Challenges a Fate Named Frank,\" Benton Harbor realizes that he's getting older, and goes to the doctor, who tells him that his cholesterol is high and he should stop being a crime-fighting superhero. Chickenman goes to an employment agency, but all of the available jobs are even more physically strenuous than fighting crime, except for a napkin-folder in a nouveau Italian-Chinese restaurant. He tries a geriatric counselor, who recommends he move to a superhero retirement community. Faced with those disappointing options, Chickenman chances it all and challenges the fates. The story was repeated in the next year's \"Poultry Slam 1996\", when \"This American Life\" was syndicated nationally.\n\n\"Chickenman\" episodes are regularly played on the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), especially on stations broadcasting to service personnel outside the continental United States. It first appeared on AFRTS during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe show can be heard daily on 101.1 The River WVRE in Dubuque, Iowa, at 7:15 am, and 5:15 pm, XM Radio's Channel 151, Laugh USA, and was formerly played on XM Radio Channel 6 before it merged with Sirius Satellite Radio.

She played the role of Nikki Spencer on the popular Australian TV soap opera \"E Street\", from September 1990 to May 1993. During the early 1990s she had a solo music career, performing mononymously as Melissa, and had top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart with \"Read My Lips\" (Number One, June 1991), \"Sexy (Is the Word)\" (No. 3, September) and \"Skin to Skin\" (No. 16, April 1992). \"Read My Lips\" also became a Number One hit in Sweden. Her debut album, \"Fresh\", was released in June 1992 and peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart.\n\nAfter her stint on \"E Street\", Tkautz has appeared on \"Paradise Beach\" (1993–94), \"Pacific Drive\" (1996–98), \"All Saints\" (2001–02, 2004), \"Swift and Shift Couriers\" (2008, 2011) and \"Housos\" (2011). Her modelling career has included early child modelling, then as a teen in various pop entertainment magazines and from 1996 on fashion and men's magazines. On 4 December 2005, she issued her second solo album, \"Lost & Found\", which provide a single, her cover version of \"The Glamorous Life\", which appeared in the top 40. In August 2011 she issued a compilation album, \"The Hits & More\". In February 2009 Tkautz married a finance businessman, Kwesi Nicholas, her partner of five years; outside her performance career she uses her married name, Melissa Nicholas.\n\nTkautz released a single \"The Key\" on 26 May 2017.\n\nTkautz was born in Sydney in 1974. According to Tkautz \"I had very strict parents ... I wasn't allowed to do anything\". Her father, Stefan Tkautz, is from Austria and her mother's family are Maltese. As a young child she studied drama, dance and singing; she began modelling and appearing in commercials. By the age of 17, she had appeared in over 160 television and print commercials. Some of these included ads for Qantas and Cadbury. She started modelling and then began acting in TV soap operas, \"Richmond Hill\" and \"Home & Away\" in the late 1980s. In 1989 she entered the Miss Teen Australia contest.\n\nIn September 1990, at the age of 16 years, Tkautz was cast in the role of Nikki Spencer on the popular Australian soap opera, \"E Street\". She described her role, \"Nikki is everything I don't want to be ... She smokes and she's really the sort of girl most parents would be horrified to have their daughters associating with\". Tkautz soon became one of the show's main stars due to the popularity of her character. During this time, she attended the Australian Academy of Dramatic Art in Sydney, graduating in 1991. During that year she appeared on numerous Australian editions of magazine covers including \"Vogue\", \"Cosmopolitan\", \"TV Week\", \"Smash Hits\" and \"Dolly\". In 1991 readers of \"TV Hits\" voted her as the Hottest Woman on Earth. Tkautz also had a supporting role in the mini-series, \"The Girl from Tomorrow\" (1992).\n\nDue to her popularity, the producers of \"E Street\" decided to have Tkautz record a song, which would be used in the show as part of a dream sequence, where her character imagines she is a pop star. This resulted in a recording career for Tkautz, she later recalled \"I loved singing and I had trained as a singer, but everything happened so quickly, it was just a crazy whirlwind. One minute I'm watching \"E Street\" in my lounge room, the next minute I’m starring in \"E Street\" and I've got a number one single in the charts\". However, in November 1991, due to the pressures of juggling two full-time careers, and a conflict with the producer, Forrest Redlich, Tkautz left \"E Street\" to concentrate on her music career. At the \"TV Week\"-sponsored Logie Awards she was nominated for Most Popular New Talent in 1992. By November 1992 Tkautz had returned to \"E Street\". However, the network decided to axe the series in May 1993.\n\nIn 1993 and 1994, Tkautz appeared on \"Paradise Beach\", playing Vanessa Campbell, the manipulative ex-girlfriend of Sean Hayden (played by Ingo Rademacher). Tkautz described her character \"[s]he's a bit of a psycho, a real bitch ... She is nothing like Nicki in \"E Street\". This one's a real troublemaker\". In 1995, she had a role in \"Echo Point\". In 1996, Tkautz joined the series \"Pacific Drive\", where she played a model, Bethany Daniels. This role had a major effect on Tkautz, who played the first long-term HIV positive character on Australian TV. She described how \"I did a lot of research on the role and a lot of charity work with HIV [patients], especially young kids who had contracted the disease\". The series later gained a cult following. When \"Pacific Drive\" was cancelled in 1998, Tkautz joined the cast of \"Medivac\" (1998) as Nurse Evie Morrison. Tkautz later appeared in the series, \"All Saints\" (2001–02, 2004).\n\nFrom 1996, Tkautz modelled for fashion and men's magazines \"Black+White\", \"Australian Playboy\", \"Ralph\" and \"FHM\". In 2001 she appeared on the Myer Intimacy Apparel runway, modelling underwear, and followed with a stint at the Australian Fashion Week, that year.\n\nIn late 2008, Tkautz starred in \"Swift and Shift Couriers\" (created by the same crew that created \"Fat Pizza\"), which aired on SBS ONE. Filming took place in early 2008, with some episodes being shot in Thailand and Egypt. The first season had eight episodes that aired on TV during October–November 2008. She returned for a second season in 2011. Tkautz was also a guest star in controversial comedy series, \"Housos\" (from October 2011) and residents of housing commission units wanted the show banned. In May 2012, Tkautz was interviewed by Sonia Kruger and David Campbell on \"Mornings\" and described her career after \"E Street\" in the segment, \"Where Are They Now?\".\n\nOn 22 July 2016, it was announced Tkautz would be one of seven women appearing on the first season of \"The Real Housewives of Sydney\".\n\nTkautz was signed to Westside Records, a label created by \"E Street\"s producers, and recorded her debut single, \"Read My Lips\". Redlich described why Tkautz was chosen ahead of her fellow actresses \"I thought it was too raunchy for Toni Pearen and too teeny-bopper for Alyssa-Jane Cook\". It was promoted via the show and released in May 1991, which reached the number-one position on the ARIA Singles Chart in July. The track was written by Tony King and Roy Nicolson, and was produced by Leon Berger. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 it won Highest Selling Single for the previous year. The song was parodied by Gina Riley on the comedy TV series, \"Fast Forward\", as \"Pout Your Lips\". The single's B-side is \"Say Goodbye\" and was written by Berger, Alston Koch and Doug Henderson. Since 1991, Tkautz has re-recorded \"Read My Lips\" twice: the first version as the \"Read My Lips (Electro Pushers Remix)\", which was to be included as a bonus track on her proposed third album, \"Glamorous Life\"; and the second version as the \"Read My Lips (Neon Stereo Remix)\", which was performed live by Tkautz on Channel 7's \"The Morning Show\".\n\nTkautz' second single from her debut album, \"Sexy (Is the Word)\", was issued in September 1991 and peaked at No. 3. It was written by Berger, King and Nicholson and produced by Berger, Koch and Henderson. She performed the track at the 1991 Rugby League Grand Final. At the end of that year Tkautz toured nationally as a support act on American dance-pop and hip hop group, C+C Music Factory's Australian Tour. Her third single, \"Skin to Skin\", appeared in April the next year, which reached No. 16, and was written and produced by the same team as \"Sexy (Is the Word)\". In June that year, having left \"E Street\", Tkautz released her debut album, \"Fresh\", which peaked at No. 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Tkautz promoted the album by a national tour, a further single, \"Is It...?\", was issued in July 1993 and reached the top 40, but a proposed second album was shelved and Tkautz refocused on her acting career.\n\nIn September 2005, Tkautz released a new single, a cover version of \"The Glamorous Life\", a 1984 song by Sheila E and written by Prince, which peaked at No. 31 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Her second album, \"Lost & Found\", was issued on 4 December that year. Also that year, she re-recorded \"Sexy (Is the Word)\", which was included as a bonus track on \"Lost & Found\". Tkautz travelled to Sweden in early 2006 to work with 2N and while there she recorded her next single, \"Easily Affected\", and \"Not Enough\". Her version of \"The Glamorous Life\" had some success internationally. It was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, Russia, Dubai and UAE, and Canada. In February 2008 she performed \"Easily Affected\", \"True Love\", \"Read My Lips (Neon Stereo Remix)\" and her new single, \"I Want Your Love\" at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Fair Day.\n\nIn January 2012 Australian comedian, Sam Kekovich, released a music video as an ad for Australian lamb meat, which was a rendition of Aqua's hit \"Barbie Girl\"; it featured vocals by Tkautz and an appearance by hip-hop dance and pop music group, Justice Crew. Meat and Livestock Australia's marketing manager, Andrew Cox, declared \"[i]t's the most successful lamb campaign ever in terms of lamb sales ... people were able to share our 'Barbie Girl' song on Facebook and Twitter\". In August that year Tkautz issued a compilation album, \"The Hits & More\", and followed with a tour promoting its appearance.\n\nIn 2015 British producers 7th Heaven Productions announced via their website that they have remixed Melissa's track Not Enough - and stated this was an upcoming single release by Tkautz. Nothing has eventuated since this announcement and no bootleg or preview of the track has been released as yet. Fans are hoping that this will be released in the future.\n\nIn December 2017 during an interview, Melissa revealed she would be heading into the recording studio in January to record her next single. She states the new single is a duet with another famous singer. No release dates or information on this project has been officially released as of 30 January 2018.\n\nIn 1999 her father, Stefan, died of cancer, she co-wrote the track, \"Goodbye Daddy\" (with Paul Wiltshire), from \"Lost & Found\" in his honour. In December 2006 Tkautz told \"Woman's Day\" that she had been in love with her \"E Street\" co-star, Simon Baker, the relationship ended as \"she wanted a long-term commitment but he was not at that stage of his life\"; and then with Marcus Graham who \"betrayed her after four months\". Baker had also appeared in the music video for her debut single, \"Read My Lips\". In February 2009 Tkautz married a finance businessman, Kwesi Nicholas, her partner of five years. She uses her married name, Melissa Nicholas, outside her professional career. Together they have two kids.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2249426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249426", "title": "WSAV-TV", "text": "WSAV-TV\n\nWSAV-TV, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 16), is a dual NBC/CW+-affiliated television station licensed to Savannah, Georgia, United States, serving southeastern Georgia's Coastal Empire and southern South Carolina's Lowcountry. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WSAV-TV's studios are located on East Victory Drive/US 80/SR 26 in Savannah's Live Oak section, and its transmitter is located on Little Neck Road in unincorporated northwestern Chatham County, near Pooler. The station can also be seen on various cable systems including Hargray, Comcast Xfinity and Charter Spectrum; WSAV-DT2 is also available through cable and DirecTV.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on VHF channel 3 on February 1, 1956 and was co-owned with WSAV-AM 630 (now WBMQ) after a long legal battle over the frequency with the owners of WJIV-AM 900. It initially aired an analog signal from a transmitter on top of a bank building on Broughton Street in Downtown Savannah. The flashing WSAV sign was a landmark on the street for many years. WSAV-AM had long carried NBC Radio programming, so WSAV-TV took the NBC television affiliation.\n\nIt shared ABC with CBS affiliate WTOC-TV (channel 11) until WJCL-TV (channel 22) started operations in 1970, when it became a full-time ABC station. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. WSAV briefly had an FM station using an antenna atop the middle of three AM towers at the transmitter facility on Oatland Island. However, without many listeners to the simulcast programming, the FM operation was ended in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1960, WSAV-AM-TV moved into a brand-new facility on Victory Drive, where WSAV-TV still is located today. A new tower was built at the site boosting its signal to many of the surrounding counties in Georgia and South Carolina. The current tower near Pooler was built in 1976. In the same year, WSAV-AM was sold. In 1982, the station swapped affiliations with WJCL and became an ABC affiliate. That network had become number one in the country and was searching for stronger affiliates. However, WSAV returned to NBC a mere three years later in 1985, one year before that network became number one again.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, like many other commercial television stations in the United States, WSAV was sold several times. At the beginning of that decade, the station was owned by a subsidiary of the News-Press & Gazette Company, who sold its entire broadcasting group of the time to the first incarnation of New Vision Television in 1993. Ellis Communications bought the New Vision stations in 1995. In 1996, Ellis was sold to Retirement Systems of Alabama who merged it with AFLAC's former broadcasting division to form Raycom Media.\n\nSince Aflac had owned rival WTOC, Raycom could not keep both channels due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations at the time forbidding common ownership of two stations in the same market; this rule would be partially repealed in 2000 when the FCC allowed common ownership of two stations in the same market provided that both of them are not the four highest-rated stations in a market with eight unique station owners. Savannah had only six full-powered stations at the time of the merger, which was too few to permit a duopoly in any case. As a result, Raycom opted to keep the higher-rated WTOC and sell WSAV. In early 1997, Raycom traded WSAV and two other stations to Media General in return for WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia. In the 2000s, this station acquired the local rights to the syndicated game shows \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\". Both were previously shown on rival WJCL for almost two decades.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, WSAV celebrated its 50th anniversary. To commemorate the event, Savannah Mayor Otis Johnson officially announced the date as \"WSAV Day\" and lauded the station for its many achievements over the decades. Its continued service to its viewers being always \"On Your Side\" whenever a viewer needs to get a story out was also recognized.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned ABC affiliate WJCL and operated Fox affiliate WTGS (channel 28), the companies were required to sell either WSAV or WJCL and its SSA with WTGS to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements. On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would keep WSAV and sell WJCL to Hearst Television, with WTGS going to Sinclair Broadcast Group. The sale was completed on December 19, and Hearst closed on its purchase of WJCL and Birmingham-based WVTM-TV (the latter of which was acquired due to an ownership conflict with WIAT) three days later.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definite agreement to be acquired by Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $4.6 billion. The combined company would be known as Nexstar Media Group, and own 171 stations (including WSAV-TV). The deal closed one year later, in January 2017. In December 2018, Nexstar announced that it would acquire Tribune Media (which owned WTVR-TV, which was subsequently sold to the E. W. Scripps Company in a separate deal); the deal would close in September 2019.\n\nWSAV was known for an unusual practice on its newscasts from the 1950s to the 1970s. Channel 3 was home to \"Captain Sandy,\" who was something of a hybrid between a weatherman and children's show host. The character gave the weather on the weeknight news working with puppet sidekicks \"Wilbur the Weather Bird,\" \"Arthur Mometer\" (the thermometer), and \"Calamity Clam.\" Captain Sandy would appear on the news set wearing a vaguely nautical cap and blazer, as a nod to the region's dependence on the Atlantic Ocean. The comedy elements of the forecast included the thermometer and the clam. Captain Sandy's big thermometer was temperamental and would fidget before revealing the next day's high and low temperatures. When Captain Sandy opened Davy Jones' Locker to get the tide information (a crucial component of any weather forecast in the region) out of Calamity Clam, the puppeteer always tried to bite the captain's hand.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, new station ownership found Captain Sandy's routine embarrassing (and likely anachronistic since most television stations had discontinued local children's shows years before) and the owners made the Captain finally conform to convention, prescribing him a suit and tie like other newscasters. The owners also fired the puppets shortly after, to the almost-certain sorrow of area children. One of the personalities behind the Captain Sandy character was smooth-voiced Joe Cox, who later left WSAV to become weatherman at cross-town rival WJCL, where he also hosted an evening radio program on WJCL-FM 96.5. The original Captain Sandy from 1956 was played by Norm Strand.\n\nWSAV-DT2 is the primary CW+ and secondary MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel of WSAV-TV, broadcasting in 720p high definition on UHF channel 16.2 (or virtual channel 3.2 via PSIP).\n\nWhat is now WSAV-DT2 began on September 21, 1998 after WSAV entered into a partnership with The WB 100+, a national programming service operated by The WB for television markets ranked greater than 100, and cable systems in the Savannah area. Prior to 1998, The WB's programming was available in Savannah via WGN-TV's national feed or local WB affiliate WATL in Atlanta. It was a cable-exclusive station, and as a result, used the call sign \"WBVH\" (standing for \"The WB Sa-V-annaH\") in a fictional manner for identification purposes. WSAV-TV provided local advertisement opportunities and performed promotional duties for the outlet.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom after 2005) and Warner Bros. Television (the company which owned The WB) announced they then would cease operating the UPN and The WB networks and combine their resources to create a programming service entitled The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of the new network's respective corporate parents.\n\nOn September 18 of that year, The CW officially launched nationwide at which point WGCW-LP started to simulcast \"WBVH\" and allowing non-cable subscribers access to the new network; WGCW-LP was, in turn, relayed over the second subchannel of WSCG, until becoming exclusive to WSCG-DT1/DT2 on May 2, 2012 when WGCW-LP had suddenly fallen silent (with the \"WGCW\" call letters remaining as a part of this CW+ affiliate's branding, although at that point a fictitious call sign that was no longer recognized by the FCC). With its over-their-air launch, \"WBVH\" began using WGCW as its official calls and became part of The CW Plus, a successor to The WB 100+.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, it was announced that WSAV-DT2 would assume the CW affiliation from WSCG-DT1/DT2 on September 12 of that year, thus shifting MyNetworkTV and MeTV to WSAV-DT3 (replacing the station's weather radar). Shortly thereafter, WSAV-TV added Laff as a new fourth digital subchannel. After the move of MeTV to WJCL-DT2 in the fall of 2019, the third subchannel was replaced with Court TV, and MyNetworkTV's schedule was shifted onto WSAV-DT2 to overlay the national late night paid programming carried as part of The CW Plus schedule.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWSAV-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 39. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3.\n\nSyndicated programming on the station includes \"Jeopardy!\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Judge Judy\", and \"Maury\".\n\nFor most of its history, WSAV has been a solid, if distant, runner-up to longtime dominant WTOC. While WSAV and WJCL made a serious threat in the 1970s, WTOC has won every timeslot since 1980 often garnering more viewers than its rivals combined. The CBS outlet airs more than seven hours of news a day, a considerable amount for a station in the 97th market and far more than any other television station in Savannah. In 1976, as part of a major expansion of its news department, WSAV moved to a former insurance office that is next door to its original East Victory Drive studios.\n\nUnlike most NBC affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone, WSAV does not offer midday newscasts during the week. The most recent addition to local news on this outlet occurred on June 21, 2010 when it added a broadcast weeknights at 5:30. As well, WSAV recently added a 5:00 newscast to the lineup. Before this point in time, WTOC had been the area's only station to air local news in those time slots.\n\nIn 2009, WSAV-DT2 launched a two-person bureau to produce a newscast weeknights at 7 called \"My Lowcountry News\", this production is specifically targeted to the South Carolina side of the market featuring coverage from throughout the Lowcountry and the state. Some stories originated from Media General's three stations in South Carolina.\n\nThere is a weather forecast targeted towards Hilton Head and Beaufort in addition to South Carolina sports headlines.\n\nWSAV does maintain a bureau on Assembly Street/SC 48 covering the Capitol in Columbia. The operating expenses are shared among Media General's television stations in South Carolina. WSAV became the last Savannah station to upgrade newscasts to high definition level on March 8, 2011. However, since WSAV-DT3 only transmits in standard definition digital, \"My Lowcountry 3\" was not included in the change. After switching to MeTV, that broadcast was reduced to a half-hour. News and weather updates from this station can be heard on WEAS-FM 93.1, WIXV-FM 95.5, WJCL-FM 96.5, WBMQ-AM 630, and WJLG-AM 900. All news anchors also serve as reporters. In early October 2013, the half-hour 7:00 newscast was moved to 10:00 p.m. (now called \"WSAV News 3 at 10:00\"), it remained a half-hour broadcast and was also shown on \"Savannah's CW 13\" (WGSA).\n\nThe station made national headlines after reporter Alex Bozarjian, who was reporting live on the Savannah Bridge Run, was slapped on her buttocks by a runner during the broadcast. Bozarjian, who kept her composure, later tweeted that the runner \"violated, objectified, and embarrassed me. No woman should EVER have to put up with this at work or anywhere!!\" The runner, later identified as Thomas Callaway, was banned from participating in future races. Callaway apologized in an interview to WSAV in which he stated, \"I'm thankful for this opportunity to share my apology to her and to her family, her friends and her co-workers. It was an awful act and an awful mistake.\"\n\nOn December 9, 2019, Bozarjian filed a sexual battery report with the Savannah Police Department against Callaway.\n\n\n"}

It was developed between 1890 and 1920 as an upper-class streetcar suburb. The early phases of the neighborhood were designed by Edward Bouton and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.\n\nJarvis and Conklin, a Chicago investment firm, purchased of land near Lake Roland in 1891 and founded the Roland Park Company with $1 million in capital. Not long after, the Panic of 1893 forced Jarvis and Conklin to sell the Roland Park Company to the firm of Stewart and Young. Despite the dire economics after 1893, Stewart and Young continued investment in the development.\n\nThe Roland Park Company hired Kansas City developer Edward H. Bouton as the general manager and George Edward Kessler to lay out the lots for the first tract. They hired the Olmsted Brothers to lay out the second tract, and installed expensive infrastructure, including graded-streets, gutters, sidewalks, and constructed the Lake Roland Elevated Railroad. The company consulted George E Waring, Jr. to advise them on the installation of a sewer system. Bouton placed restrictive covenants on all lots in Roland Park. These included setback requirements and proscriptions against any business operations. Bouton and the Roland Park Company initially intended to include covenants to exclude blacks from the development, but on advice of counsel did not include them in the deeds. The Roland Park Company would later insert these covenants into deeds in Guilford, Homeland and Northwood.\n\nIt was a modern development, electricity for lighting throughout the neighborhood as well as gas for cooking and lighting. Water came from artesian wells dug up to , nearly of water mains were constructed, in addition to of roadways, and of sidewalks.\n\nBouton and some Baltimore investors purchased the interests of Roland Park and reorganized the company in 1903.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, Jr. cited Roland Park as a model residential subdivision to his Harvard School of Design students. Duncan McDuffie, developer of St. Francis Wood in San Francisco, called Roland Park \"an ideal residential district.\" Jesse Clyde Nichols had found inspiration in Roland Park when he was planning the Country Club District of Kansas City. Nichols continued to refer to Roland Park as an ideal residential development when he counselled other residential developers.\n\nRoland Park Shopping Center is a single building strip of stores which opened in 1907 to serve the community, located at the corner of Upland Road and Roland Avenue. It has been credited by Guinness World Records as the world's first shopping center (though some editions of Guinness incorrectly date it to 1896). Since it had only six stores, despite it being an important milestone, larger shopping centers such as the Country Club Plaza (1923) in Kansas City, Missouri have received more attention as being \"first,\" depending on what definition is used.\n\nThe neighborhood is within the bounds of Baltimore City Public Schools and is assigned to Roland Park Elementary/Middle School, a K-8 school that earned the Blue Ribbon for Academic Excellence from the state department of education in 1997 and 1998.\n\nThere are several private schools in the neighborhood: Friends School of Baltimore, Gilman School, Roland Park Country School, the Bryn Mawr School, Cathedral School, and Boys' Latin School of Maryland. In addition, St. Mary's Seminary and University is located in Roland Park.\n\nThere is also a branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Roland Park.\n\nThe Baltimore Light Rail's Cold Spring Lane Station is within walking distance of much of the neighborhood, just across the Jones Falls Expressway to the west.\n\n"}

Its main use is in cooking, where its high smoke point makes refined corn oil a valuable frying oil. It is also a key ingredient in some margarines. Corn oil is generally less expensive than most other types of vegetable oils.\n\nCorn oil is also a feedstock used for biodiesel. Other industrial uses for corn oil include soap, salve, paint, erasers, rustproofing for metal surfaces, inks, textiles, nitroglycerin, and insecticides. It is sometimes used as a carrier for drug molecules in pharmaceutical preparations.\n\nAlmost all corn oil is expeller-pressed, then solvent-extracted using hexane or 2-methylpentane (isohexane). The solvent is evaporated from the corn oil, recovered, and re-used. After extraction, the corn oil is then refined by degumming and/or alkali treatment, both of which remove phosphatides. Alkali treatment also neutralizes free fatty acids and removes color (bleaching). Final steps in refining include winterization (the removal of waxes), and deodorization by steam distillation of the oil at under a high vacuum.\n\nSome specialty oil producers manufacture unrefined, 100%-expeller-pressed corn oil. This is a more expensive product since it has a much lower yield than the combination expeller and solvent process, as well as a smaller market share.\n\n\n\n"}

The area lies adjacent to the southwest corner of the Glacier Peak Wilderness, northwest of Stevens Pass on U.S. Highway 2 and northeast of the town of Skykomish, Washington. Wild Sky Wilderness is located immediately southwest of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. While the wilderness straddles the Cascade Mountain Range, most of it is in the westside ecotype. The wilderness lies in parts of Snoqualmie, Mount Baker, and Wenatchee national forests.\n\nThe Henry M. Jackson Wilderness was created by the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act and named after former U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington. Senator Jackson was instrumental in the designation of many of the state's wildernesses, and this \"forest\" of fabled peaks recalls his efforts.\n\nCross-Cascade Indian trails paralleled the Little Wenatchee River and provided routes for later exploring parties such as the 1860 E.F. Cady party for whom Cady Pass and Cady Creek were named. The area is rich in mining history with several acres of patented mining claims within its borders.\n\nThe terrain is rugged, with steep slopes, and finger ridges dissected by small intermittent or permanent drainages. Streams in the northern portion of this area drain into the Sauk River, while the southern portion drains into the Skykomish River. Main features of this area include Cady Creek Ridge and Cady Creek, as well as the Beckler River's tributary the Rapid River, the true source of the South Fork Skykomish River.\nThe Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail traverses the southern portion of the wilderness.\n\nThe Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail winds down the high heart of the area for about 32 miles. Other trails snake up from the east and west to join the PCT. The Blanca Lake Trail leads 3.5 miles to Blanca Lake, and five short pathways approach the center of the northwest section and fade to bushwhacking terrain.\n\nThe wilderness area contains approximately 30 lakes which receive moderate fishing. One of the most popular of these lakes is Blanca Lake due to its beautiful turquoise green color.\n\nA tall forest covers the lower elevations, then thins out and changes in species to eventually open into broad meadows on many ridge tops.

{"id": "2249459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249459", "title": "Piste", "text": "Piste\n\nA piste () is a marked ski run or path down a mountain for snow skiing, snowboarding, or other mountain sports.\n\nThis European term is French (\"trail\", \"track\") and synonymous with 'trail', 'slope', or 'groomed run' in North America. The word is pronounced using a long \"e\" sound so that it rhymes with \"beast\".\n\nIncreasingly, North Americans employ its common European antonym, 'off piste', to describe backcountry skiing, especially when referring to skiing outside officially approved areas of a ski resort.\n\nPistes are usually maintained using tracked vehicles known as snowcats to compact or \"groom\" the snow to even out trail conditions, remove moguls, and redistribute snow to extend the ski season. Natural snow is often augmented with snow making machines early in the season or when the snowpack is low.\n\nTypically, grading is done by the resort, and grades are relative to other trails within that resort. As such, they are not classified to an independent standard; although they are likely to be roughly similar, skiers should be cautious about assuming that grades in two different resorts are absolutely equivalent.\n\nIn North America, Australia and New Zealand, a color–shape rating system is used to indicate the comparative difficulty of trails (otherwise known as slopes or pistes).\n\nThe steepness of ski trails is usually measured by grade (as a percentage) instead of degree angle. In general, beginner slopes (green circle) are between 6% and 25%. Intermediate slopes (blue square) are between 25% and 40%. Difficult slopes (black diamond) are 40% and up. However, this is just a general \"rule of thumb\". Although slope gradient is the primary consideration in assigning a trail difficulty rating, other factors come into play. A trail will be rated by its most difficult part, even if the rest of the trail is easy. Ski resorts assign ratings to their own trails, rating a trail compared only with other trails at that resort. The resort may take into consideration the width of the trail, sharpest turns, terrain roughness, and whether the trail is groomed regularly.\n\nIn Europe, pistes are classified by a color-coded system. The actual color system differs in parts for each country, although in all countries blue (easy), red (intermediate) and black (expert) are used. Shapes are often not used, sometimes all ratings are circles as being defined in the basic rules of the German Skiing Association DSV. The three basic color codes of the DSV have been integrated into the national standards DIN 32912 in Germany and ÖNORM S 4610 f in Austria. \n\nSlopes marked green, blue or red are groomed in all countries; blacks are groomed in Italy, Austria and Switzerland, while in France most black slopes are not groomed, but some are. All other classifications are generally not groomed. Sometimes slopes are marked on piste maps as dotted or as dashed lines, this also signifies that the slope is not groomed.\n\nThe ratings are:\n\nAlpine slope classification in Europe is less rigidly tied to slope angle than in North America. A lower angle slope may be classified as more difficult than a steeper slope if it requires better skiing ability because, for example, it is narrower, requires carrying speed through flatter sections or controlling speed through sharp hairpin turns, or features off-camber slope angles or exposed rock.\n\nJapan uses a color-coded system, but shapes do not usually accompany them. Some resorts, mainly those catering to foreigners, use the North American or European color-coding system, adding to the confusion. The usual ratings are:\n\nJapan has more than 1000 ski areas (115 in Nagano Prefecture alone), many of them small and family-oriented, so comparisons between slope classifications in Japan and \"equivalent\" slopes in Europe or North America are minimal.\n\n"}
{"id": "2249461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249461", "title": "Irish clans", "text": "Irish clans\n\nIrish clans are traditional kinship groups sharing a common surname and heritage and existing in a lineage based society prior to the 17th century. A clan (or \"fine\" in Irish) included the chief and his agnatic relatives; however clans also included unrelated clients of the chief.\n\nThe Irish word \"clann\" is a borrowing from the Latin \"planta\", meaning a plant, an offshoot, offspring, a single child or children, by extension race or descendants. For instance the O'Daly family were poetically known as \"Clann Dalaigh\", from a remote ancestor called Dalach.\n\nClann was used in the later Middle Ages to provide a plural for surnames beginning with \"Mac\" meaning \"Son of\". For example, \"Clann Cárthaigh\" meant the men of the MacCarthy family and \"Clann Suibhne\" meant the men of the MacSweeny family. Clann was also used to denote a subgroup within a wider surname, the descendants of a recent common ancestor, such as the \"Clann Aodha Buidhe\" or the \"O'Neills\" of Clandeboy, whose ancestor was Aodh Buidhe who died in 1298. Such a 'clan', if sufficiently closely related, could have common interests in landownership, but any political power wielded by their chief was territorially based.\n\nFrom ancient times Irish society was organised around traditional kinship groups or clans. These clans traced their origins to larger pre-surname population groupings or clans such as Uí Briúin in Connacht, Eóghanachta and Dál gCais in Munster, Uí Neill in Ulster, and Fir Domnann in Leinster. Within these larger groupings there tended to be one \"sept\" (division) who through war and politics became more powerful than others for a period of time and the leaders of some were accorded the status of royalty in Gaelic Ireland. Some of the more important septs to achieve this power were Ó Conor in Connacht, MacCarthy of Desmond and Ó Brien of Thomond in Munster, Ó Neill of Clandeboy in Ulster and MacMorrough Kavanagh in Leinster.\n\nThe largely symbolic role of High King of Ireland tended to rotate among the leaders of these royal clans. The larger or more important clans were led by a Taoiseach or Chief who had the status of royalty and the smaller and more dependent clans were led by Chieftains. Under Brehon Law the leaders of Irish clans were appointed by their kinsmen as custodians of the clan and were responsible for maintaining and protecting their clan and its property. The clan system formed the basis of society up to the 17th century.\n\nScholars sometimes disagree about whether it is better to use the terms \"sept\" or \"clan\" when referring to traditional Irish family groups. Historically, the term 'sept' was not used in Ireland until the nineteenth century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated. It is often argued that the English word 'sept' is most accurate referring to a sub-group within a large clan, especially when that group has taken up residence outside of their clan's original territory (O'Neill, MacSweeney, and O'Connor are examples). Related Irish septs and clans often belong to larger groups, sometimes called tribes, such as the Dál gCais, Uí Néill, Uí Fiachrach, and Uí Maine. Recently, the late Edward MacLysaght suggested the English word 'sept' be used in place of the word 'clan' with regards to the historical social structure in Ireland, so as to differentiate it from the centralised Scottish clan system.[1] This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate. Brehon Law, the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, which collapsed after the Tudor Conquest. The Irish, when speaking of themselves, employed their term 'clan' which means \"children of the family\" in Irish, though in Northern Irish the word has come to mean 'family'; this latter is \"teaghlach\" in Standard Irish, the other Irish dialects and in Scotland.\n\nIn the 16th century English common law was introduced throughout Ireland, along with a centralised royal administration in which the county and the sheriff replaced the 'country' and the Clan Chief.\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Ireland was created in 1541, the Dublin administration wanted to involve the Gaelic chiefs into the new entity, creating new titles for them such as the Earl of Tyrone, or Baron Inchiquin. In the process they were granted new coats of arms from 1552. The associated policy of surrender and regrant involved a change to succession to a title by the European system of primogeniture, and not by the Irish tanistry, where a group of male cousins of a chief were eligible to succeed by election. This change to the inheritance system was also taken up by the Scottish clans in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe early 17th century was a watershed in Ireland. It marked the destruction of Ireland's ancient Gaelic aristocracy following the Tudor re-conquest and cleared the way for the Plantation of Ulster. In 1607 the senior Gaelic Chiefs of Ulster left Ireland to recruit support in Spain but failed, and instead eventually arrived in Rome where they remained for the rest of their lives (see: Flight of the Earls). After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established real control over all of Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native clans and their lordships.\n\nHowever, despite the loss of their traditional lands and forced emigration into the service of Catholic monarchs across Europe, the spirit of the Irish clans remained. The growing influence of the Gaelic League at the turn of the 20th century rekindled an interest in Gaelic culture and prompted a cultural revival.\n\nIn the 1940s Edward MacLysaght, the Chief Herald of Ireland, drew up a list of over 240 Irish clans. The first modern Irish \"clans\" were reformed in the latter half of the 20th century. Today such groups are organised in Ireland and in every continent around the world.\n\nIn 1989 an independent organisation, Clans of Ireland, was formed under the leadership of Rory O'Connor, Chieftain of the \"O'Connor Kerry Clan\", with the purpose of creating and maintaining a Register of Clans, which can be consulted on the organisation's website.\n\n\n\n"}

Due to their ocean proximity, they had a greater reliance on seafood than other tribes. \nThe tribe was one of the first to be visited by European seafarers, whose abduction of tribal members for slavery and introduction of diseases reduced the Nauset population even before large-scale colonization of New England. The pilgrims' first contact with the Nauset was during their landing near present-day Provincetown, when they discovered a deserted village, the Nauset being away at their winter hunting grounds. Desperately low on supplies, the pilgrims helped themselves to a cache of maize, though they left a note (in English) promising to pay for what they had stolen. The promise was eventually kept when the Nauset returned months later. The Nauset also returned a small boy who had wandered away from the colony and become lost, an act which greatly improved relations with the colonists.\n\nIn subsequent years, the Nauset became the colonists' closest allies. Most became Christianized and aided the colonists as scouts and warriors against the Wampanoag during King Philip's War. Their numbers, always small, were reduced, but the addition of other American Indian tribes after King Philip's War and intermarriage with other settlers preserved Indian lineage. Although no longer distinct as a tribe, most of the Mashpee Wampanoag band are descended from Nauset people, who currently number 1,100 people and are federally recognized (as Wampanoag).\nNot only does their bloodline live on in some self-identified Wampanoag tribal members, Hyannis and the Wianno section of Osterville are named after the Nauset sachem Iyannough.\n\n\n"}

The Romans rebuilt the road as \"via XVIII\" or \"Via Nova\" and refounded the Celtiberian port as \"Iria Flavia\" (\"Flavian Iria\") to compliment Roman emperor Vespasian.\n\nKing Juan Carlos of Spain granted the illustrious resident, writer Camilo José Cela, the title of \"Marqués de Iria Flavia\".\n\nNo later than 561, perhaps from 400 AD, Iria was the seat of a bishopric, also known in Latin as Locus Sancti Iacobi ('place of Saint James', in Spanish Santiago), that became a suffragan of the (Portuguese) Metropolitan of the Archdiocese of Braga and shared its seat with (Santiago de) Compostela, which developed into Iberia's major pilgrimage destination (rivalling Rome and Jerusalem) then moved there in 1095. The modern city on the site of Iria Flava is Padrón.\n\nThe followers of the executed bishop Priscillian of Avila were deeply embedded in the culture of Iberia's northwest. To restore Catholic orthodoxy in the Visigothic marches that were recovered from the Kingdom of the Suebi (Galicia) in a series of campaigns during the years leading up to 585, nine dioceses were established in Galicia, including Iria Flavia, mentioned in the document \"Parroquial suevo\" (ca 572–582); the \"Parroquial\" divides the region into dioceses and marks the first definitive integration of this zone in the monarchy of the Visigoths, who had been catholicized from Arianism in 587 (Quiroga and Lovell 1999). The list of the bishops of Iria present at councils and noted in other sources begins in the sixth century with an Andreas and gains historic credibility in the seventh . No commercial or political rationale for siting a bishop at Iria Flavia seems to present itself, though excavations have identified a cult sanctuary dating to the second half of the sixth century (Quiroga and Lovelle 1999). The relics that were identified with Saint James the Greater and which were transferred to Compostela may originally have determined the location of the diocese at Iria, to control the already sanctified site.\n\nAt any rate, otherwise unidentified considerations dictated that the new bishopric take the place of the older bishopric at \"Aquae Celenae\" (modern Caldes De Reis), which was a Roman \"municipium\" and administrative center that was formerly of considerably more importance than isolated Iria.\n\nUnder Adaulfus (Ataulf) II, the city was destroyed by Norse pirates, and bishop and chapter took refuge behind the strong walls of Compostela. Soon they petitioned Ordoño II of León and Pope Nicholas I to permit them (c. 860) to transfer the see from Iria to Compostela, near the sepulchre and church of St James (founded c. 835). Both pope and king consented, on condition that the honour of the see should be divided between the two places. From the second half of the ninth century the bishops of this see are known as \"Irienses\" or \"Sancti Jacobi\", even \"ecclesiae apostolicae sancti Jacobi\"—though no apostolic succession was possible—and finally as \"Compostellani\" (\"Catholic Encyclopedia\").\n\nIn 1024 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Tui, only to lose it back in 1069 to (re)establish the Diocese of Tui.\n\nIn 1095, through reverence for the body and the sepulchre of St James, Urban II, by a Bull of December 5, withdrew from Iria its episcopal rank and transferred the see in its entirety to Compostela, in favour of the Cluniac bishop, Dalmatius, present at the Council of Clermont that year. At the same time Urban exempted it from the authority of the metropolitan and made it immediately subject to the Holy See.\n\nAbout the year 1100 Diego Gelmírez, bishop of Compostela, rebuilt the former cathedral church, Santa Maria Adina, which had been destroyed by Almanzor. Excavations have revealed that the site was built on Roman foundations. A Roman votive figure of a bull has been found, published in \"Corpus Artis Gallaeciae\" .\n\nAs the legend of Saint James the Greater having proselytized in Hispania spread, Iria Flavia came to be accounted the first site of his preaching.\n\n\"(possibly missing earlier incumbents)\n\n In 1969 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Iria Flavia (also Curiate Italian) / Irien(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nSo far it had only one incumbent, of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :\n\n"}

{"id": "2249520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249520", "title": "Diego Gelmírez", "text": "Diego Gelmírez\n\nDiego Gelmírez or Xelmírez (Latin \"Didacus Gelmirici\") (ca 1069 – ca 1140) was the second bishop (from 1100) and first archbishop (from 1120) of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, modern Spain. He is a prominent figure in the history of Galicia and an important historiographer of the Iberia of his day. Diego involved himself in many quarrels, ecclesiastical and secular, which were recounted in the \"Historia Compostelana\", which covered his episcopacy from 1100 to 1139 and serves as a sort of \"gesta\" of the bishop's life.\n\nHe was probably born at Catoira, where his father, Gelmiro or Xelmirio, was the custodian of the castle. He received an education at the court of Alfonso VI of Castile. In 1092, Raymond, count of Galicia, named him his notary and secretary and in 1093 he was the administrator of the Compostelan church. In 1094, Dalmatius was appointed the first bishop of Compostela. Dalmatius died the next year (1095) and the people of the see requested the king nominate Diego administrator again during the vacancy. In 1099, the pope authorised a new episcopal election and Diego was chosen the next year. He was anointed the second bishop of Compostela in 1101. During his tenure, he was given secular rule of the city by Alfonso and he strove to make Compostela a major pilgrimage destination, which he did. He increased the prestige of his see and the volume of pilgrims on the road to Compostela.\n\nIn 1107 Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, the guardian of the heir, Alfonso Raimúndez, rebelled against Queen Urraca and her new husband, Alfonso the Battler. According to the \"Historia\", he was opposed by a \"brotherhood\" (\"germanitas\") led by the knight Arias Pérez and Diego Gelmírez, who had known each other since childhood. Diego Gelmírez had accepted the leadership of the brotherhood late in 1109 or early in 1110. In 1110 a truce between Pedro and the brotherhood was broken when the former took over the south Galician fortress of Castrelo de Miño and installed a garrison there under his wife Urraca and the young Alfonso. Arias promptly besieged it, and Pedro came to defend it. The besieged called on Diego to negotiate terms of surrender, which he did, but the brotherhood had grown suspicious of him and when a deal was struck Arias had Diego, Pedro, and Alfonso all arrested. In exchange for the castles of Oeste and , they were all soon released and Diego went over to the separatists. In 1111, Diego crowned Alfonso Raimúndez King of Galicia in opposition to Urraca and her husband.\n\nLate in 1113, when the royal court was in Galicia, Arias was inciting Urraca against Diego. Urraca deprived him of his secular authority at the request of the people, who agitated for communal rights, but she reinstated him in his temporal powers within a year and even exempted him from all military service to the crown and extended his charge over the whole diocese.\n\nIn 1120, Pope Callixtus II elevated Diego and his see to archiepiscopal rank and appointed him papal legate to Spain. That same year, according to the \"Historia\", Urraca ordered the leading men (\"principes\") of Galicia, including Arias Pérez, to do homage (\"hominium\") to Diego Gelmírez as \"their lord, their patron, their king and their prince, saving their fealty to the queen\" and recognise his rule (\"dominio\"). In 1121, however, after Diego had renewed his alliance with the Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, his power appeared to threaten that of the queen. In the summer of 1121 she had Diego arrested at Castrelo in collaboration with Arias Pérez. Diego was imprisoned for a while, but the support of the people, which he had been cultivating, compelled his release. Sometime in 1121 Munio Peláez built an \"adulterine\" (i.e. illegal) castle on the river Iso near Compostela. The \"Historia Compostelana\" calls it a \"den of robbers and bandits\", and Diego managed to raze it to the ground soon after it was built.\n\nIn the spring of 1126, shortly after Urraca's death and the accession of Alfonso, Arias led a rebellion in Galicia. Diego Gelmírez and Gómez Núñez of Toroño or perhaps Gutierre Vermúdez were charged \"per litteras\" (\"by letter\") with putting it down. Diego besieged Arias in Lobeiro and, with siege engines, in Tabeirós, forcing him to surrender. Diego's opinion of Arias was such that he said to him: \"I fear, therefore, that if such that you are you leave this world, you will lose eternal life and incur the perpetual condemnation of your soul.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2249533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249533", "title": "Festive Fifty", "text": "Festive Fifty\n\nThe Festive Fifty was originally an annual list of the year's 50 (though the exact figure varied above and below this number) best songs compiled at the end of the year and voted for by listeners to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. It was usually dominated by indie and rock songs which did not fully represent the diversity of music played by Peel but rather the majority opinion among his listeners. After Peel's death the tradition of the Festive Fifty was continued, first by other Radio 1 DJs and then (when Radio 1 decided to discontinue it) by the Internet radio station Dandelion Radio.\n\nThe first Festive Fifty was broadcast in 1976 and differed in format to later charts in that it was not restricted to songs from that year. It was topped by Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", first released in 1971, and also contained many older songs. The following year, Peel's producer suggested that instead of taking a poll (which might simply be a retread of 1976's list), Peel should simply compile a list of his favourite songs of the year. Long thought lost, this list of the \"Forgotten Fifty\" (consisting of 61 songs) was finally pieced together from rare archive materials for the 2007 BBC book \"The Peel Sessions\". The following years returned to a listener poll and listed mostly contemporary songs - \"Anarchy in the UK\" by the Sex Pistols topped three consecutive charts from 1978 and came second in the 1981. This marked a period of domination of the upper reaches of the chart by punk artists as the genre was embraced by Peel and his listeners, though other genres were represented further down the list, and the continuing presence in the list of \"Stairway to Heaven\" until 1979 showed that the older generation of Peel listeners had not completely abandoned the show. \n\nIn 1982 the shift to a strictly annual chart was made. In the early 1980s post-punk records by bands such as Joy Division and The Cocteau Twins featured heavily in the chart. In the mid and later 1980s indie bands began to gain recognition with The Smiths making many appearances, including a record eleven entries in the 1987 list, but by this time Peel was beginning to become disillusioned with his listeners' tastes, complaining that there were too many \"white boys with guitars\" and not enough diversity. This trend of popular music continued in the early 1990s, despite Peel's championing of emerging rave and dance acts on his show. In 1991 Peel didn't get around to compiling the Fifty until the following year, and didn't broadcast it until 1993, where he played one song from it once a week. This 1991 chart, which became known as the \"Phantom Fifty\", was not the only year to feature an anomaly. In 1997 Peel decided that he didn't have enough time on-air around Christmas to do a countdown, and it was only from listener pressure that he agreed to do a 'Pretty Festive 31', which was topped by Cornershop's \"Brimful of Asha\". Despite this, the later 1990s and 2000s the list featured a more diverse range of acts, such as The Delgados and The Cuban Boys, who were favourites of Peel and his listeners. \n\nAfter John Peel died in 2004, the chart for that year was played by Rob Da Bank and was topped by The Fall - Peel's favourite band and prolific session guests. Huw Stephens from Radio 1's One Music strand, the original replacement for Peel's show, joined fellow One Music presenter Rob Da Bank for the chart for 2005.\n\nIn 2006, after One Music was removed from the Radio 1 schedule, the Festive Fifty was discontinued. Peel's former production team, however, invited the internet radio station Dandelion Radio to take up the compilation and broadcast of the Festive Fifty, which they have done since 2006.\n\nThe Festive Fifty began as an all-time chart. (1976, 78, 79, 80 and 81 were all-time charts.) Two all-time charts have been compiled in addition to yearly charts, once in 1982 and again in 2000 (to celebrate the millennium). The 1982 chart focused heavily on punk and post-punk artists. It was topped by the Sex Pistols, with Joy Division, The Clash, New Order and Siouxsie and the Banshees all making numerous appearances. The 2000 chart was a more diverse affair. It still contained many of the same songs - three of the top five were the same - but newer bands (such as Pavement and Stereolab) had been assimilated and also older artists from a wider variety of genres made appearances (such as Nick Drake and The Beach Boys.)\n\nNote 1: All-time list\n\n"}

{"id": "2249553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249553", "title": "Kraków Old Town", "text": "Kraków Old Town\n\nKraków Old Town is the historic central district of Kraków, Poland. It is one of the most famous old districts in Poland today and was the center of Poland's political life from 1038 until King Sigismund III Vasa relocated his court to Warsaw in 1596.\n\nThe entire medieval old town is among the first sites chosen for the UNESCO's original World Heritage List, inscribed as \"Cracow's Historic Centre\". The old town is also one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomnik historii\") chosen in the first round, as designated September 16, 1994, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.\n\nThe Old Town is known in Polish as \"Stare Miasto\". It is part of the city's first administrative district which is also named \"Stare Miasto,\" although it covers a wider area than the Old Town itself.\n\nMedieval Kraków was surrounded by a 1.9 mile (3 km) defensive wall complete with 46 towers and seven main entrances leading through them. The fortifications around the Old Town were erected over the course of two centuries. The current architectural plan of Stare Miasto – the 13th-century merchants' town – was drawn up in 1257 after the destruction of the city during the Tatar invasions of 1241 followed by raids of 1259 and repelled in 1287. The district features the centrally located Rynek Główny, or Main Square, the largest medieval town square of any European city. There is a number of historic landmarks in its vicinity, such as St. Mary's Basilica (\"Kościół Mariacki\"), Church of St. Wojciech (\"St. Adalbert's\"), Church of St. Barbara, as well as other national treasures. At the center of the plaza, surrounded by \"kamienice\" (row houses) and noble residences, stands the Renaissance cloth hall Sukiennice (currently housing gift shops, restaurants and merchant stalls) with the National Gallery of Art upstairs. It is flanked by the Town Hall Tower (\"Wieża ratuszowa\").\n\nThe whole district is bisected by the Royal Road, the coronation route traversed by the Kings of Poland. The Route begins at St. Florian's Church outside the northern flank of the old city walls in the medieval suburb of Kleparz; passes the Barbican of Kraków (\"Barbakan\") built in 1499, and enters Stare Miasto through the Florian Gate. It leads down Floriańska Street through the Main Square, and up Grodzka to Wawel, the former seat of Polish royalty overlooking the Vistula river.\n\nIn the 19th century most of the Old Town fortifications were demolished. The moat encircling the walls was filled in and turned into a green belt known as Planty Park.\nThe first mention of Kraków dates back to the second half of the 9th century. By the end of 10th century the city was incorporated into the Polish state under the rule of Piast dynasty. The episcopal bishopric was awarded to Kraków in 1000 and around that time, it became the residence of Polish kings for centuries to come. The history of the old city of Kraków revolves mainly around its Old Town District of today. Here, the regalia were stored and, back in early Middle Ages, a cathedral school was erected.\n\nAround 700 A.D., local tribes initiated the process of forming the Vistulan State by uniting with each other. Numerous remains of a once massive earth embankment encircling Wawel Hill survived till this day. A chest with 4,200 iron axes weighing about 4 tons was found in a basement of a house at Kanoniczna 19 street. These axes were commonly known under the name of \"płacidłos\" which is a word derived from the Polish verb \"płacić\" – to pay. As it happens the axes were a main legal tender in the neighboring Great Moravian State. The value of the treasure chest is the greatest to be discovered thus far and testifies to Kraków's significant wealth and power in the region. At Wawel's foot, in the place where now Kanoniczna, Grodzka and other neighboring streets are located, remains of a Vistulan settlement called Okół were found. This settlement, the beginnings of which can be dated at least back to the early 9th century, was surrounded by an enormous oak palisade and, in the place where now the Straszewska and St. Gertrude's streets run, by one of Vistula's arms. Near Main Market Square – specifically near Church of St. Wojciech and Church of St. Mary and Bracka street - another discovery was made. Found were the relics of craft workshops and of dwelling houses which were originally raised near Vistula. What is more, under St. Wojciech's Church parts of a wooden temple were discovered. In those days Vistula had many arms which in turn formed several little islands in Kraków's center. Kazimierz was one of such islands. It is also possible that Okół, Wawel and the Main Market Square were islands separated from the main land by moats or Vistula's arms. Also, many structures were found on Wawel but it is extremely difficult to establish when they were built.\n\nThe bishops residing at Wawel and the prince's court provided a strong intellectual atmosphere. Since the 14th century, Kraków was the site of royal coronations. Under Casimir III the Great the Jagiellonian University, one of Europe's oldest institutions of higher learning, was founded.\n\nIn 1386 the Polish throne was entrusted to Lithuanian prince Władysław Jagiełło, husband of Queen Jadwiga. Jagiełło founded the next Polish dynasty, the Jagiellon dynasty. Kraków instantly became the capital of a large monarchy which propelled the city's political and cultural development. Many great artists did their work in Kraków at that time.\n\nThe Old Town saw considerable development during the Renaissance. It was then when, for instance, Wawel Cathedral was rebuilt to include the architectural features of the Italian Reneissance. Bona Sforza, the second wife of Sigismund I of Poland, asked Bartolommeo Berrecci, Francisco the Florentian, Giovanni Maria Padovano, Santi Gucci and others to do this task. As a result, Kanoniczna Street became a part of the Old Town. It carries many features that are typical for that period. With the passing of the last Jagiellon king, the political life of Poland began to move to Warsaw.\n\nThe Baroque Era emerged in the beginning of the 17th century. In Poland Sigismund III became a prominent patron of the arts. Under his direction, architect Giovanni Trevano worked in Kraków and redesigned the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in a Baroque style. During that period the Old Town was destroyed twice during a Swedish invasion. Towards the end of the 17th century, the Church of St. Anne was built as was the Church of St. Casimir the Prince, known for its catacombs.\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, some outstanding works of art were created by fine architects including Kacper Bażanka and Franciszek Placidi. The culture of the Baroque era left a lasting mark on this part of the city. Gothic churches were converted into the spirit of the Baroque era and were fitted with new altars, sculptures, and paintings.\n\nIn 1794, the armies of Tadeusz Kościuszko rallied to defend Poland against foreign partitions. The Kościuszko Uprising ended with their defeat, and in 1795 Poland underwent its final partition, after which Kraków became a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In spite of these political developments, Kraków in a sense remained important for Polish patriots. The city's many cultural monuments became national memorials and the only representation of national identity for the next century.\n\nIn the 19th century, Austrian Emperor Franz I decided to liquidate the long neglected city fortifications. The liquidation was carried out during the time of the Duchy of Warsaw. Thanks to the efforts of Professor Feliks Radwański, the northern part of the walls were saved, including the Barbican, the Florian Gate and three towers which once marked the starting point of the Royal Road along which a new monarch would parade to the place of his coronation at Wawel Cathedral. The Planty Park was created in the place of the destroyed fortifications.\n\nDuring this period the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre was constructed. It is located at Holy Ghost Square. The theatre was built in place of an old hospital that was run by the Order of the Holy Ghost. The building is an example of the Polish Eclectic architectural style. In 1850 a fire spread through the city and caused substantial damages.\n\nIn 1876 prince Władysław Czartoryski gave the city some of his artistic and patriotic collections. Three years later, the National Museum in Kraków was established. Kraków became the centre of museology in Poland. Famous artists such as Jan Matejko and Stanisław Wyspiański worked in the Old Town, which was also the place where numerous political independence movements were born.\n\nOn September 6, 1939, German forces entered Kraków. The city became the capital of the General Government. The oppression of Jews began and a concentration camp was created in Plaszow. The Old Town was plundered and many works of art were stolen. Museums, schools and theatres were closed. Professors were arrested. Jewish synagogues were devastated, despoiled of ceremonial objects and turned into storehouses for ammunition, firefighting equipment and Nazi general storage sites.\nOn January 18, 1945 the Soviet forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Front under the command of Marshal Ivan Konev entered Kraków and forced the German army to withdraw. Kraków emerged as a city in the newly established People's Republic of Poland.\n\nToday the Old Town attracts visitors from all over the world. The historic centre is one of 14 places in Poland that are included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The architectural design of the Old Town has survived many cataclysms of the past and has retained the original form that was established in medieval times.\n\nThroughout the year the Old Town is lively and crowded. There are many tourists, indefatigable florists, and lined up horse-drawn carriages waiting to give a ride. The place is always vibrant with life especially in and around the Main Market Square, one of the biggest squares in Europe, which came into existence when the city was given Magdeburg Rights in 1257. Tourist attractions such as the Town Hall Tower, the Sukiennice (also known as the Cloth Hall), old tenements with fine shops, and Adam Mickiewicz Monument are all located there. While near the monument, one can listen to the heynal, which is played each hour from the highest tower of St. Mary's Church.\n\nThere are many cafes, pubs and clubs, which are located in medieval basements and cellars with vaulted ceilings. The most famous places include \"Wierzynek\" Restaurant and Club \"Pod Jaszczurami\". Numerous events, concerts and exhibitions are organized there.\n\n\"Obwarzanki krakowskie\", or twisted ring-shaped breads, are undoubtedly a symbol of Kraków. On the Square there is a \"obwarzanki\" seller every few steps. Traditional \"obwarzanki\" are sprinkled with poppy-seeds. Today, sellers offer a whole variety of them; apart from poppy-seed there are also sesame seed, rock salt and even pizza sprinkles. One can eat them while strolling or in a horse-drawn carriage while cruising around and glancing at yet another symbol of the old city, namely Kraków pigeons. One can also come across various buskers and mimes.\n\nNumerous legends purport to explain the presence of numerous pigeons on the Main Square. According to one legend, Henry IV Probus, who tried to take over the Senioral Province during the period of regional disintegration of Poland, attempted to go to Rome with financial offerings in order to gain papal approval for his coronation. However, a certain enchantress turned his knights into pigeons. They pecked out some pebbles from the walls of St. Mary's Church, which then turned into gold. With these riches the prince set off to Vatican, but while on his way he lost everything and never managed to reach his destination. He returned to Kraków. None of his knights ever regained a human form.\n\nThe Old Town district of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art. Its rich variety of historic architecture includes Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, stained glass, paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.\n\nMany renowned points of interest in the Old Town, drawing constant stream of visitors, include galleries as well as departments of the National Museum in Kraków such as the Sukiennice Museum, the Jan Matejko Manor, Stanisław Wyspiański Museum at 11 Szczepanska, Czartoryski Museum with Arsenal at 19 Św. Jana Street, as well as the Historical Museum of Kraków (\"Rynek Główny 35\") with its departments: the Barbican, the House under the Cross housing History of Theatre museum, Hippolitow House, Town Hall Tower, Archdiocesean Museum and Archeological Museum. There are also: the Pharmacy Museum, Collegium Modicum at Jagiellonian University, the Old Theatre Museum and the renowned Collegium Maius Museum of the Jagiellonian University, including the Palace of Bishop Erazm Ciołek (on Kanoniczna). Two major theatres are also located there: the Old Theatre, and the most famous Juliusz Słowacki Theatre.\n\nThe extended list of Catholic churches in the Old Town include: Church of St. Andrew, Church of St. Ann, Church of St. Barbara, Church and Monastery of Franciscans, Church of St. Giles, St. John's The Baptist and St. John's The Evangelist Church, Reformatory Church of St. Casimir, Church of Our Lady of Snows, Church of St. Martin, Church of St. Mary, Church of St. Marc, St. Peter's and Paul's Church, Pijary Church, Church of St. Tomas, St. Trinity Church (Dominican Church) and Church of St. Wojciech.\n\nThe Old Town district has a profusion of bronze statues and marble monuments. The most pronounced is the Monument of Adam Mickiewicz situated at the Main Marketplace between the St. Mary's Church and the eastern side of Sukiennice. It was unveiled for the centenary of Adam Mickiewicz's birth. The poet is surrounded by four lower groups which symbolize: Homeland i.e. Poland (from the face of the monument), Science – an old man with a boy (from the side of Florianska Street), Poetry (from the side of the Church of St. Wojciech), and Patriotism and Valour (facing Sukiennice). The monument was designed by Teodor Rygier, cast in Rome, and ceremonially unveiled on 16 June 1898. It is a key part of the Market Square panorama and a place of meetings for many young people.\n\nOther well known monuments include: the monument commemorating the poet Józef Bohdan Zaleski at Basztowa Street, showing harpist with a guide boy, made in 1886 by Pius Welonski; the Monument of Jagiello and Jadwiga at Planty Park, made by Tomas Oscar Sosnowski and raised in 1886 in celebration of the quincentenary of the Union between Poland and Lithuania; and the Monument of Lilia Weneda at Planty Park, erected to commemorate poet Juliusz Słowacki showing a character from the poet's drama playing a harp, made by Alfred Daun in 1884. Across from the Palace of Art stands the Monument of Artur Grottger made by Waclaw Szymanowski in 1901. Monument of Piotr Skrzynecki is in front of the Vis-á-vis café on the Main Market Square. The monument of Jozef Dietl on the All Saints’ Square was made by Ksawery Dunikowski in 1938 and erected in honor of the first president of Kraków. The monument to Aleksander Fredro is featured in front of the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre, near the Planty Park. It was made by Professor Cyprian Godebski in 1900.\n\nAlong Planty – near the Collegium Novum – is the monument to astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus depicting him as an established scholar. It was made by Godebski in 1900. Grażyna Monument at Planty Park presents characters from Adam Mickiewicz's novel entitled \"Grażyna\" (\"Grażyna and Litawor\"). It was made by Alfred Daun in 1884. Monument of Florian Straszewski also at Planty Park is an obelisk erected in honor of co-originator of the Park and made by Edward Stehlik in 1874. The bust of comedy writer Michał Bałucki made by Tadeusz Błotnicki in 1911 is located behind the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre. The Soviet Soldiers’ Graveyard monument situated near the Barbican till 1997 was later moved to Rakowicki Cemetery. Monument to Unknown Soldiers who fell during the Kraków's liberation in 1945 was made by Karol Muszkiet and Marcin Bukowski in 1945. Sculpture entitled \"Polonia\" near the Church of Franciscans presents the mother, holding a baby in her arms, with a weasel and two dogs. It was made by Genowefa Nowak in 1968. Monument of Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, a friend of Stanisław Wyspiański, stands near the exit from Poselska Street. It was made by Edward Krzak in 1980. The monument of Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha stands in front of the Church of St. Franciscans. It was made from August Zamoyski's 1976 design. Monument of Tadeusz Kościuszko sculptured by Leonardo Marconi and Antoni Popiel is featured at Wawel. It was cast in bronze in 1900 and erected around 1920 by the newly established Tadeusz Kościuszko Society to celebrate the return of Poland's independence. New sculpture \"Eros Bendato\" made by Igor Mitoraj is situated on the Main Market Square, near the Town Hall Tower.\n\nAmong the best known places to visit in and around the Old Town is Wierzynek restaurant at the Main Market Square. Its name refers to townsman Mikołaj Wierzynek and a feast held by him in the 14th century. The artistic café, Jama Michalika, boasts over a hundred years of literary traditions. Here the Zielony Balonik Cabaret has come into being and the Spirit of Young Poland has arisen. At the Main Market Square there is also the Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret, created by renowned local artists, and a students’ club Pod Jaszczurami. The club is a legend in academic cultural circles. It is a popular place of meetings for the academic environment of Kraków where visitors are always welcome.\n\nMoreover, the Square in the city center is a place where many famous people and many important events were and are commemorated. There are plaques dedicated to the oath of Tadeusz Kościuszko in 1794, to Prussian Homage in 1525, and to supporting the renovation of Main Market Square from 1964.\n\n\n"}

It was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. \"Girl\" was the last complete song recorded for that album. \"Girl\" is one of the most melancholic and complex of the Beatles' earlier love songs.\n\nThe song's instrumentation has specific similarities to Greek music, as with \"And I Love Her\" and \"Michelle\". As for the inspiration of the song's lyrics, Lennon stated that the \"girl\" was an archetype he had been searching for and would finally find in Yoko Ono. He said: \"'Girl' is real. There is no such thing as the girl, she was a dream, but the words are all right. It wasn't just a song, and it was about that girl – that turned out to be Yoko, in the end – the one that a lot of us were looking for.\" In an interview for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 1980, Lennon said of his song \"Woman\": \"Reminds me of a Beatles track, but I wasn't trying to make it sound like that. I did it as I did 'Girl' many years ago. So this is the grown-up version of 'Girl'.\"\n\nMcCartney claimed that he contributed the lines \"Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure\" and \"That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure.\" However, in a 1970 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Lennon explained that he wrote these lines as a comment on Christianity, which he was \"opposed to at the time\". Lennon said: \"I was just talking about Christianity, in that – a thing like you have to be tortured to attain heaven ... – be tortured and then it'll be alright, which seems to be a bit true but not in their concept of it. But I didn't believe in that, that you have to be tortured to attain anything, it just so happens that you were\".\n\nAuthor Ian MacDonald describes \"Girl\" as \"Lennon's answer to McCartney's 'Michelle': another Euro-song, replacing his partner's suave mock-French with a decadent German two-step crossed with Mikis Theodorakis's music for \"Zorba the Greek\"\". Performed by Lennon and George Harrison, the acoustic guitars on the track were played with capos, lending an extra brightness to their sound. Musicologist Walter Everett comments that one of Harrison's guitar parts has the capo positioned so high up the neck and is played by him in a manner that creates a \"nasal, sitar-like 'bouzouki' sound\".\n\nLennon's lead vocals were initially overdubbed and featured a characteristic unheard before on a Beatles song. In McCartney's description: \"My main memory is that John wanted to hear the breathing, wanted it to be very intimate, so George Martin put a special compressor on the voice, then John dubbed it. … I remember John saying to the engineer (Norman Smith) when we did 'Girl,' that when he draws his breath in, he wants to hear it.\" Following the Beatles' request, the engineer added more treble to the vocal, which, in Everett's description, matches the sound and timbre of the brushed cymbal played by Ringo Starr. In the song's middle eight sections, McCartney and Harrison sing the word \"tit\" repeatedly as vocal harmony. McCartney stated that this part of the vocal arrangement was influenced by the Beach Boys. He recalled: \"The Beach Boys had a song out where they'd done 'la la la' and we loved the innocence of that and wanted to copy it, but not use the same phrase.\"\n\nIn early 1966, \"Girl\" was issued as the B-side of \"Michelle\" in several European countries. It was also released as the A-side of a single in Italy, backed by \"Nowhere Man\".\n\nIn November 1977, Capitol Records scheduled the United States release of \"Girl\" backed with \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" as a single (Capitol 4506) to accompany the release of \"Love Songs\", a Beatles' compilation album that contains both of these songs. However, the single was cancelled before it was issued. Promotional copies, which featured \"Girl\" on both sides—one in stereo, the other mono, along with a picture sleeve, were issued. (All copies of this promotional single were pressed on black vinyl.)\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, except as noted:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2249566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249566", "title": "I'm Looking Through You", "text": "I'm Looking Through You\n\n\"I'm Looking Through You\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album \"Rubber Soul\". It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. McCartney wrote the song about English actress Jane Asher, his girlfriend for much of the 1960s, and her refusal to give up her stage career and focus on his needs. The line \"You don't look different, but you have changed\" reflects his dissatisfaction with their relationship. The lyrics also refer to his changing emotional state: \"Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight\".\n\nDuring October and November 1965, the Beatles recorded three versions of \"I'm Looking Through You\". Take 1 was recorded on 24 October and was slower than the version released on \"Rubber Soul\", having a tempo of 132 beats per minute. It had a significantly different rhythm and lacked the \"Why, tell me why …\" middle eight of the final version. Take 1 was eventually released in 1996 on the \"Anthology 2\" compilation. Take 1 also featured an electric twelve-bar blues jam, and a pitch centre in the key of G.\n\nThe Beatles recorded the first remake of the track on 6 November, towards the end of the \"Rubber Soul\" sessions, but were again dissatisfied with the result. Take 4, the final version, was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November. This version is in the key of A and features a bridge passage based on a descending major scale, extending a ninth from 6 down to 5. The same melodic structure was later used by McCartney in the verse of \"Penny Lane\", the chorus of \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", and in instrumental sections of \"Hello, Goodbye\" and \"Lady Madonna\". \n\nThe North American stereo version of the song contains two false guitar starts, which were cut from the other mixes. Allegedly, the engineers at Capitol Records thought the false start was intentional, and left it in.\n\nThe album sleeve and other sources indicate that Ringo Starr played Hammond organ on this track. Starr plays quick two-note vamps in the choruses.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref> Mark Lewisohn reported that Hammond organ was not listed on the session tape box.\n\nIn his contemporary review of \"Rubber Soul\" for the \"NME\", Allen Evans said that \"I'm Looking Through You\" sounded \"like earlier Beatles numbers\", adding: \"A quiet, rocking song about a girl who has changed after letting her boy down. Ringo on organ!\" \"Record Mirror\"s reviewer recognised Starr's unfamiliar role as an example of the album's \"spirit of everybody having a go at everything\". The writer admired the song's rhythm, McCartney's singing, and George Harrison's \"top-notch guitar-work\". Nikki Wine of \"KRLA Beat\" described the track as a \"really swingin' cut\" and \"Wonderful fun\", with an \"almost-bluesy sound\".\n\nThomas Ward of AllMusic calls \"I'm Looking Through You\" one of the \"finest\" songs on \"Rubber Soul\" and one of the \"minor gems of the Beatles canon\". He highlights McCartney's lyrics, describing them as one of the most \"mature\" of the period, and praises his lead vocal.\n\nAccording to authors Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin except where noted:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2249575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249575", "title": "In My Life", "text": "In My Life\n\n\"In My Life\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album \"Rubber Soul\". It was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who later disagreed over the extent of their respective contributions to the song. Lennon credited the harmony and bridge to McCartney, while McCartney claimed the entire musical structure. George Martin contributed the piano solo bridge, which was sped up to sound like a harpsichord.\n\nAccording to Lennon, \"In My Life\" was his \"first real major piece of work\" because it was the first time he penned personal lyrics about his own life. The original version of the lyrics was based on a bus route he used to take in Liverpool, naming various sites seen along the way, including Penny Lane and Strawberry Field. Lennon discarded this lyrical idea in favour of a more generalized meditation on his past. He and McCartney later revisited those original references with their respective songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\".\n\n\"In My Life\" inspired more pop music producers to use harpsichords in their arrangements. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked \"In My Life\" number 23 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", as well as fifth on their list of the Beatles' \"100 Greatest Songs\". The song placed second on CBC's 50 Tracks. \"Mojo\" magazine named it the best song of all time in 2000. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 160th most celebrated song in popular music history.\n\nIn a 1980 interview, Lennon referred to this song as his \"first real major piece of work\" because it was the first time he penned personal lyrics about his own life. According to Lennon, the song's origins can be traced to when the English journalist Kenneth Allsop made a remark that Lennon should write songs about his childhood. Afterwards, Lennon wrote a song in the form of a long poem reminiscing on his childhood years. The original version of the lyrics was based on a bus route he used to take in Liverpool, naming various sites seen along the way, including Penny Lane and Strawberry Field.\n\nLennon later thought the original lyrics were \"ridiculous\", calling it \"the most boring sort of 'What I Did On My Holidays Bus Trip' song\". He reworked the words and replaced the specific memories with a generalized meditation on his past. \"Very few lines\" of the original version remained in the finished song. According to Lennon's friend and biographer Peter Shotton, the lines \"Some [friends] are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all\" referred to Stuart Sutcliffe (who died in 1962) and to Shotton. \n\nRegarding composition of the music, Lennon's and McCartney's recollections differ. Referring to McCartney, Lennon said \"his contribution melodically was the harmony and the middle-eight itself.\" In 1977, when shown a list of songs Lennon claimed writing on for the magazine \"Hit Parader\", the only entry McCartney disputed was \"In My Life\". McCartney said he set Lennon's lyrics to music from beginning to end, taking inspiration for the melody from songs by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. In 1976, he commented: \"I liked 'In My Life'. Those were words that John wrote, and I wrote the tune to it. That was a great one.\"\n\nA 2018 study that used bag-of-words modelling, conducted by artificial intelligence researchers at Harvard University, reported that there was a .018% probability of McCartney writing the entire song. Lennon was given an 81.1% certainty of writing the verses, while McCartney was given a 43.6% certainty of writing the bridge. The analysts stated: \n\nThe song was recorded on 18 October 1965, and was complete except for the instrumental bridge. At that time, Lennon had not decided what instrument to use, but he subsequently asked George Martin to play a piano solo, suggesting \"something Baroque-sounding\". Martin wrote a Bach-influenced piece that he found he could not play at the song's tempo. On 22 October, the solo was recorded with the tape running at half speed, so when played back at normal pace the piano was twice as fast and an octave higher, solving the performance challenge and also giving the solo a unique timbre, reminiscent of a harpsichord.\n\nPer Ian MacDonald\n\n\n"}

The game was produced by Beam Software and published by Acclaim Entertainment under their LJN label.\n\nWhen Doc takes Marty to the year 2015 to prevent his future son from committing a crime, old Biff takes the \"Gray's Sports Almanac\" and travels back to 1955 and gives the book to his younger self. Over the next three decades, young Biff uses the information to win money on the outcome of each sporting event he bets on, making him the richest and most powerful man in the world by 1985A. To ensure that no one else gets their hands on the almanac, Biff travels through time and collects various items and puts them behind locked doors in three different periods. This action has caused a disruption in time, and now the space-time continuum is falling apart. With Hill Valley in ruins, Marty must now travel to all three periods, then find and return all the items back to their original places in order to retrieve the almanac and destroy it.\n\nAfter Marty returns all items to their rightful places and burns the almanac, lightning strikes the DeLorean and sends Doc back in time, leaving Marty stranded in 1955 once again. At the same time, Marty receives a letter from Doc via a courier that was written in 1875 (although 1885 in the film). According to the old letter, Doc has become stranded in the past and must be rescued or else this will start another time-ripple effect. Now, with the help from 1955 Doc, Marty must go back in time in order to rescue the present-day Doc with the aged but repaired DeLorean. Before they can return to 1985, Marty must find and return ten more items to their rightful location. To impede his progress, outlaw Buford Tannen has other plans.\n\nThe player controls Marty and attempts to defeat enemies by jumping on or throwing projectiles at them. The player must also collect fuel for the time machine and junk food for extra lives as they progress through each timeline. \n\nScattered and hidden throughout each timeline are Object Rooms (containing objects which must later be returned to other locations) and alleyways used to navigate street to street within the timeline. Some alleyways appear in all three timelines while others appear in one or two but not all three. At other points the player must use the DeLorean to navigate large chasms that appear on different timelines.\n\nAs the player progresses through the level they obtain keys by killing certain enemies. These keys are used to unlock the various object rooms throughout each level. Within each object room the player must obtain one of the items ostensibly scattered by Biff. The rooms appear as locked doors in \"Part II\" and caves or various buildings in \"Part III\". \n\nTo retrieve the items Biff scattered, the player must participate in a mini-game within the object room involving collecting a certain number of stop watches in 60 seconds while avoiding enemies and obstacles such as cacti, quicksand and falling pellets.\n\nPuzzle rooms are hidden throughout each level and found in various drainage pipes and manholes. Each puzzle room contains the scrambled name of the object that belongs there. The player must unscramble the word and select the proper item from their inventory. Correctly choosing the item that belongs within the room reveals one section of a picture puzzle. However, if the player chooses the wrong item, the item is removed from their inventory and returned to the object room in which it was previously located, forcing the player to complete the challenge within that room to re-obtain the object.\n\nIn \"Part III\", puzzle rooms are located under rocks that the player must break open by jumping on them a few times.\n\nAfter finding the remote control to summon the DeLorean, players can time travel between 1955, 1985 and 2015. However, adequate fuel must be collected before being able to time travel using the DeLorean. \n\nAdditionally, each time the player time travels a clone of Marty is created in that year which, when touched, will instantly kill the player.\n\nSome platforms are out of reach in certain areas which need to be accessed to progress through the level. A player can plant an acorn in 1955 and then revisit that same location in 1985 or 2015 where a full-grown tree appears, allowing the player to access the previously unattainable space.\n\nStan Stepanic of Gamefreaks365.com gave \"Back to the Future II & III\" positive remarks in regards to similarities with \"The Goonies II\", but gave it a largely negative review due to the lack of a password or save feature coupled with its notorious length, although there was a code to skip to the second half of the game. Stan stated that it took him roughly six hours just to map it, and he spent so much time trying to finish it he actually turned it off out of boredom.\n"}

He won a Tony Award.\n\nBorn Abram Solman Borowitz in New York City, Burrows graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and later attended both City College and New York University. He began working as a runner on Wall Street while at NYU, and he also worked in an accounting firm. After he met Frank Galen in 1938, the two wrote and sold jokes to an impressionist who appeared on Rudy Vallée's radio program.\n\nHis radio career gained strength when he collaborated with Ed Gardner, the writer and star of radio's legendary \"Duffy's Tavern\". The two created the successful series after Gardner's character, Archie, premiered on \"This Is New York\", an earlier radio program. Burrows was made the show's head writer in 1941, and he credited his experience with inventing the Runyonesque street characters he fashioned for \"Guys and Dolls\". \"The people on that show,\" Burrows once said about \"Duffy's Tavern\", \"were New York mugs, nice mugs, sweet mugs, and like (Damon) Runyon's mugs they all talked like ladies and gentlemen. That's how we treated the characters in \"Guys and Dolls\".\"\n\nBurrows also wrote for Danny Kaye's short-lived mid-1940s radio comedy show, helping head writer Goodman Ace fashion material for Kaye and co-stars Eve Arden and Lionel Stander. He quit \"Duffy's Tavern\" in 1945 to work at Paramount Pictures but soon returned to radio. As a guest on \"Here's Morgan\" in 1947, Burrows performed \"I'll Bet You're Sorry Now, Tokyo Rose, Sorry for What You Done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he became a popular guest on the Hollywood party circuit, performing his own satirical songs (\"Darling Why Shouldn't You Look Well Fed, ‘Cause You Ate Up a Hunka My Heart?\" and \"The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes\"). Such informal performances led to a nightclub act and regular appearances as a performer on CBS radio programs, and to his eventually hosting his own radio program, \"The Abe Burrows Show\", (CBS) from 1947 to 1949. As he recalled years later, his show came about while he was scripting a radio show for Joan Davis when George Jessel asked him, \"When the hell are you gonna become a professional?\" Burrows continued as Davis' head writer while doing his own show.\n\nMixing comic patter (\"I guess I could tell you exactly what I look like, but I think that's a lousy thing to say about a guy\") with his clever comic songs, \"The Abe Burrows Show\" was popular with listeners and critics but not with its sponsor, Lambert Pharmaceutical, then the makers of Listerine mouthwash, but promoting a Listerine toothpaste on the show. Lambert, according to Burrows, complained that the show wasn't selling much of the toothpaste. \"It seems that my fans were being naughty,\" he wrote. \"While they were laughing at my jokes, they were sneering at my toothpaste.\"\n\nBoth of Burrows' radio shows originated from KNX, CBS's Los Angeles affiliate, whose program director Ernie Martin encouraged Burrows, who had done some film work, to think about writing plays. \"I told him I felt my funny stuff was okay for radio, but I didn't think people would pay theater prices to hear it,\" Burrows recalled.\n\nBurrows credited his success in the theatre to his work under the theatre legend George S. Kaufman. In the Kaufman biography by Howard Teichmann, Burrows is quoted as saying that what he said (as a director, to his cast) was what he heard Kaufman say in their collaboration on \"Guys and Dolls\".\n\nEventually, Burrows wrote, doctored, or directed such shows as \"Make a Wish\", \"Two on the Aisle\", \"Three Wishes for Jamie\", \"Say, Darling\", \"Guys and Dolls\", \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", \"Cactus Flower\", \"Four on a Garden\", \"Can-Can\", \"Silk Stockings\", \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", \"Good News\" (1974 revival), and many others. With his collaborator Frank Loesser, Burrows won a Pulitzer Prize for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.\"\n\nBurrows wrote and directed the first Broadway musical version of a Jane Austen novel, \"First Impressions\", a rewriting of \"Pride and Prejudice\". The show, which ran for 84 performances in 1959, is widely described as a flop. Burrows thought that critics panned the show because they wondered why a comedy guy was taking on \"tired period drama,\" but the script shows some unusual choices. Burrows had his version of heroine Elizabeth Bennet decide to join forces with her marriage-hungry mother in order to snag hero Mr. Darcy.\n\nBurrows also became a famous script doctor, enough so that the desperate remark of a producer, \"Get me Abe Burrows!\", remained for many years Broadway shorthand for a script that needed repair. Yet Burrows himself downplayed that role in his memoir, and discussed his fixing of \"Make a Wish\":\n\n\"Guys and Dolls\" was apparently selected as the winner for the Pulitzer Prize in Letters. However, because of Burrows' troubles with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), no Pulitzer for Letters was awarded in 1951, as the Trustees of Columbia University had the right of veto.\n\nBurrows wrote the screenplay for \"The Solid Gold Cadillac\" in 1956 as well as produced a television series \"Abe Burrows' Almanac\" (1950) and \"The Big Party\" (1959).\n\nIn 1980, he published his memoir, \"Honest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?\", in which he recalled the meat of his career. His mentored several comedy writers, including future \"M*A*S*H\" writer Larry Gelbart (who was once a \"Duffy's Tavern\" writer), Nat Hiken, Dick Martin and Woody Allen, the latter a distant cousin of Burrows.\n\nOver three decades, Burrows appeared as a panelist on such programs as \"This Is Show Business\", \"What's My Line?\", \"To Tell the Truth\", and \"Match Game 77\", all on CBS.

{"id": "2249590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249590", "title": "If I Needed Someone", "text": "If I Needed Someone\n\n\"If I Needed Someone\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist. It was released in December 1965 on their album \"Rubber Soul\", except in North America, where it appeared on the 1966 release \"Yesterday and Today\". The song reflects the reciprocal influences shared between the Beatles and American band the Byrds. On release, it was widely considered to be Harrison's best song to date. A recording by the Hollies was issued in Britain on the same day as \"Rubber Soul\" and peaked at number 20 on the national singles chart.\n\nHarrison wrote the song for Pattie Boyd, the English model whom he married in January 1966. The lyrics convey an ambivalent tone, however, and have invited interpretation as a message to a casual love interest. Harrison based the song's jangly guitar riff on a riff used by Roger McGuinn in the Byrds' adaptation of \"The Bells of Rhymney\". \"If I Needed Someone\" features prominent three-part harmony vocals and Rickenbacker twelve-string electric guitar – the instrument that the Byrds had adopted to replicate Harrison's sound in the 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". The song's use of drone and Mixolydian harmony also reflected Harrison's nascent interest in Indian classical music. Following its inclusion in the set list for the Beatles' 1965 UK tour, it became the only Harrison composition performed live by the group.\n\nThe Hollies' success with the song gave Harrison his first chart hit as a songwriter, although his criticism of their performance led to a terse exchange in the press between the two groups. Several other artists covered the track in the first year after its release, including the American bands Stained Glass and the Kingsmen. A live recording by Harrison, taken from his 1991 tour with Eric Clapton, appears on the album \"Live in Japan\". Clapton also performed the song at the Concert for George tribute to Harrison in 2002, while McGuinn released a cover version on his 2004 album \"Limited Edition\".\n\nIn addition to reflecting George Harrison's interest in Indian classical music, \"If I Needed Someone\" was inspired by the music of the Byrds, who in turn had based their sound and image on those of the Beatles after seeing the band's 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". According to music journalist David Fricke, the composition resulted from \"a remarkable exchange of influences between the Beatles and one of their favorite new bands, the Byrds\". The two groups formed a friendship in early August 1965, when the Byrds were enjoying international success with their debut single, a folk rock interpretation of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and Harrison and John Lennon attended their first shows in London. Although the concerts received unfavourable reviews in the British music press, Harrison lauded the band as \"the American Beatles\". In late August, the Byrds' Jim (later Roger) McGuinn and David Crosby met up with the Beatles in Los Angeles, where they discussed with Lennon and Harrison the music of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar and American Indo-jazz pioneer John Coltrane. The meeting led to Harrison introducing the sitar on Lennon's song \"Norwegian Wood\", and to Crosby and McGuinn incorporating Indian influences into the Byrds' \"Why\" and \"Eight Miles High\".\nHarrison likened \"If I Needed Someone\" to \"a million other songs\" that are based on a guitarist's finger movements around the D major chord. The song is founded on a riff played on a Rickenbacker 360/12,<ref name=\"Williamson/Uncut\"></ref> which was the twelve-string electric guitar that McGuinn had adopted as the Byrds' signature instrument after seeing Harrison playing one in \"A Hard Day's Night\". When McGuinn told him this in Los Angeles, Harrison was appreciative of the recognition, particularly as his contributions to the Beatles were often overshadowed by those of Lennon and Paul McCartney. In late 1965, Harrison acknowledged the Byrds' influence on \"If I Needed Someone\" when he sent a copy of the Beatles' new album, \"Rubber Soul\", along with a message for McGuinn and Crosby, to Derek Taylor, the Byrds' publicist. In his note, Harrison said that the riff was based on the one McGuinn had played on the Byrds' adaptation of \"The Bells of Rhymney\", and that the rhythm was based on the drum part in \"She Don't Care About Time\". McGuinn later recalled: \"George was very open about it. He sent [the record] to us in advance and said, 'This is for Jim' – because of that lick [in 'The Bells of Rhymney'].\"\n\nWriting in \"The Beatles Anthology\", Harrison commented on the difficulties he faced as a nascent songwriter during the \"Rubber Soul\" period, relative to Lennon and McCartney, both of whom had been writing \"since they were three years old\". He said he wrote \"If I Needed Someone\" as a love song to Pattie Boyd, the English model whom he married soon after the song's release. The lyrics have nevertheless invited interpretation as being about a groupie or, in the words of music journalist Robert Fontenot, \"some other attempt by the singer to juggle two affairs at once\". Author Peter Doggett comments on Harrison's inspiration, in the context of the Beatlemania that continually encroached on the band's lifestyle: \"'If I Needed Someone' may be the first pop song written from the jaded, though not quite exhausted viewpoint of a man who had women lined up outside his hotel door in every city of the world.\"\n\nAs recorded by the Beatles, \"If I Needed Someone\" is in the key of A major, over the verses, and B minor in the middle eights (or bridges). The time signature throughout is 4/4. After its introduction, the composition consists of two verses, a bridge, three verses (the second of which serves as an instrumental break), followed by a repeat of the bridge, a further verse, and an outro. The song is in the folk rock style, but incorporates aspects of Indian music through the suggestion of drone over the main musical phrase and its partly Mixolydian harmony. Harrison uses a capo on the guitar's seventh fret, thereby transposing the D major chord shape to sound as A major.\n\nThe Mixolydian melody in the verses comprises the notes A, G, B, C and D, partly mirroring the riff, and is delivered in the same syncopated phrasing. On the fifth bar of each verse, a B melody-note sounds over a VII triad – a chord that musicologist Dominic Pedler terms a G/A \"slash\" polychord, similar to that used at the start of \"A Hard Day's Night\". The implied drone, or pedal point, in A continues under this new chord, aided by the arpeggiated bass line remaining in A. The verses retain an ascendant melodic quality due to the syncopated delivery, the three-part harmonies in the vocal arrangement, and the constant bass figure.\n\nOver the bridges, the new key is set fully in the minor mode, avoiding the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At the end of each bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.\n\nAuthor Jonathan Gould describes \"If I Needed Someone\" as \"a rueful rain check of a love song\" and \"an exercise in hypothetical romance\". He comments that the melody's phrasing on the off-beat and the \"drastically arpeggiated\" bass line mirror the lyrical theme of \"right person at the wrong time\". As with much of the Beatles' songwriting on \"Rubber Soul\", the lyrics reflect Dylan's influence, in terms of tone and content. Further to the message of the song title, Harrison offers his love only if he should happen to need \"someone\", and on the condition that time allows for such a relationship; he conveys his feelings in matter-of-fact terms. In Fontenot's description, the lyrics \"are representative of the change in the Beatles' outlook and also of its era: tender but ambivalent\". Harrison invites the woman he addresses to \"Carve your number on my wall\", yet offers only the possibility that he will contact her in the future.\n\nOver the two bridges, Harrison presents a more engaged perspective. He states that he's \"too much in love\", but had he and his lover met \"some other day\", the outcome might have been different. Fontenot cites these lyrics as the reason why some commentators attach an alternative meaning to the song, whereby the singer is already in a committed relationship and is addressing another woman, with the prospect of continuing a casual encounter. In author Andrew Grant Jackson's reading, \"[Harrison] was heading towards marriage with Pattie Boyd, so the lyrics address all the women of the world, saying that had he met them earlier, it might have worked out, but now he was too much in love (but give me your number just in case).\" While considering that Harrison appears to be \"playing his options, albeit gently\", author John Kruth deems the line \"Carve your number on my wall\" to be \"one of \"Rubber Soul\"s most enigmatic lyrics\" and an evocation of the imagery in \"Norwegian Wood\".\n\nGeorge Martin, the band's producer, described \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the first album to present a new, growing Beatles to the world\". Throughout the project, the Beatles increasingly experimented with sound textures. In the case of \"If I Needed Someone\", as with \"Girl\", a Lennon composition recorded at the end of the sessions, the use of a guitar capo midway along the instrument's neck introduced a brighter tone to the group's guitar sound. Their use of three-part harmonies on the song was also typical of the warmer, more mature sound they achieved on \"Rubber Soul\".\n\nThe Beatles taped the rhythm track of \"If I Needed Someone\" at EMI Studios in London, in a single take, on 16 October 1965. The recording took place just before midnight at the end of a session dedicated to their next single, \"Day Tripper\". Harrison played his new, 1965 Rickenbacker 360/12 on the song. According to musicologist Walter Everett, the sound of Harrison's chiming guitar, combined with that of Lennon's Fender Stratocaster rhythm part, produced \"the Beatles' brightest guitar sound yet\", and so served as \"a fitting tribute to the Byrds\". Using his new Rickenbacker 4001S bass, McCartney inaugurated an ostinato-heavy style that would feature prominently on the band's 1966 recordings, particularly the song \"Rain\".\n\nThe group carried out their vocal overdubs during the afternoon of 18 October. Over the instrumental break and the outro, the harmonies consist of McCartney singing a third above and Lennon a tenth below Harrison's double-tracked lead vocal. During the same session, Ringo Starr added a tambourine part. Although some Beatles authors credit Martin as having played harmonium, Fontenot says this contribution is inaudible on the completed track.<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> Jackson writes that the sound on \"If I Needed Someone\" was \"so transcendent\", in its combination of elements from the two Byrds songs and the Beatles' \"soaring harmonies\" and treble-rich guitar parts, that Lennon chose to use it for his \"Rubber Soul\" track \"Nowhere Man\". A mono mix of the song was made on 25 October, and a stereo mix on 26 October – the day the Beatles collected their MBEs from Buckingham Palace.\n\nEMI's Parlophone label released \"Rubber Soul\" on 3 December 1965, with \"If I Needed Someone\" sequenced as the penultimate track. In the United States – where Capitol Records typically altered the content of the Beatles' albums, reducing the number of songs and using single A- and B-sides to create further album releases – the track instead appeared on the North American album \"Yesterday and Today\" in June 1966. The song was widely considered to be Harrison's best composition to date; according to music critic Richie Unterberger, \"If I Needed Someone\" and \"Think for Yourself\", which also appeared on the UK version of \"Rubber Soul\", were the first Harrison-written songs \"to really make people sit up and notice\". In his review for the \"NME\", Allen Evans described it as \"a quick-tempo up-beater\" and a \"more-ish track\". McCartney later said he considered \"If I Needed Someone\" to be the first of Harrison's \"landmark\" songs for the group.\n\nBeginning with the band's UK tour in December 1965, \"If I Needed Someone\" replaced \"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\", written by Carl Perkins, as Harrison's lead vocal spot in the Beatles' live shows. \"If I Needed Someone\" thereby became the only Harrison composition that the Beatles played in concert during their touring years of 1963–66.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> In addition, with the group finding it increasingly difficult to replicate their studio recordings in concert, it was one of only two \"Rubber Soul\" tracks that they performed live, the other being \"Nowhere Man\". In their 1966 concerts, McCartney introduced Indian-style melisma into his singing on \"If I Needed Someone\", similar to the vocal ornamentation he had used on the recording of Harrison's \"Revolver\" track \"I Want to Tell You\". In a segment subtitled \"Beatlemania goes sour\", the 1982 documentary \"The Compleat Beatles\" used a clip from the Beatles' ragged performance of the song, at the Budokan Hall in Tokyo, as an illustration of the growing division between the band as recording artists and live performers.\n\nIn November 1995, \"If I Needed Someone\" was issued as the B-side of \"Norwegian Wood\" on a jukebox single, pressed on green vinyl. The release was part of a series of Beatles jukebox singles issued by Capitol's CEMA Special Markets division. The song was also one of the Beatles tracks that Capitol included on the compilation album \"The Best of George Harrison\", released in 1976 following the expiration of Harrison's contract with EMI.\n\nIn late October 1965, the Hollies were brought a demo of \"If I Needed Someone\" by their producer, Ron Richards, who had received the demo from George Martin. At this stage of their career, most of the Hollies' singles were written by outside writers,<ref name=\"Larkin/Hollies\"></ref> yet the band were divided about whether to record a Beatles song, given the traditional rivalry between the two groups' hometowns, Liverpool and Manchester. With Graham Nash and Allan Clarke keen to record the song, the Hollies accepted it as the follow-up to their recent hit \"Look Through Any Window\". The group recorded their version in three takes on 17 November 1965, in the same studio as the Beatles. Backed by the Clarke–Hicks–Nash composition \"I've Got a Way of My Own\", the single was released by Parlophone on 3 December, the same day as \"Rubber Soul\".\n\"If I Needed Someone\" was the first Harrison composition to become a chart hit, as a result of the Hollies' cover. Their version peaked at number 20 in Britain, but by their standards at the time, it was one of their least successful singles. Many listeners perceived the song as the Hollies attempting to align themselves with the Beatles. In one of his articles covering the Beatles' concurrent UK tour, Alan Smith of the \"NME\" quoted Harrison as saying that the Hollies' version was \"rubbish\"<ref name=\"Smith/OnTour\"> Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).</ref> and that \"the way they do their records, they sound like session men who've just got together in a studio without ever seeing each other before. Technically good, yes. But that's all.\" Lennon also criticised their treatment of the song, having long disliked the Hollies' sound. These comments incensed Nash, who responded by saying that he was tired of Lennon's continual insults and would \"back any of us boys against the Beatles musically any time\". In January 1966, at a press conference following his and Boyd's wedding, Harrison laughed off a reporter's question as to whether he had invited the Hollies to the ceremony, adding that the issue had \"just got out of hand\".\n\nAlthough he and Harrison later became \"great friends\", Nash attributed the single's relatively low chart position to Harrison's derision of the group's performance. Author Ian Inglis writes that the formation of Crosby, Stills & Nash – comprising Crosby from the Byrds, Nash from the Hollies, and ex-Buffalo Springfield guitarist Stephen Stills – brought the connections behind \"If I Needed Someone\" \"full circle\". Everett comments that the three-part parallel harmony singing, for which Crosby, Stills & Nash were \"revered\", suggests the influence of \"If I Needed Someone\".\n\nWriting in \"Rolling Stone\" in January 2002, Greg Kot described \"If I Needed Someone\" as Harrison's \"finest tune to date\" by 1965. In the same publication, David Fricke included it in his list of the \"25 Essential Harrison Performances\". Fricke described the track as, variously, a \"folk-rock diamond\" and \"the ultimate compliment\" to the Byrds in its \"striking blend of cool dismissal ... and crystalline riffing\". Writing for \"Q\" magazine, John Harris recognised \"Rubber Soul\" as marking Harrison's \"first decisive stride forward\" as a songwriter, with \"If I Needed Someone\" suggesting for the first time that he could match the standard of Lennon and McCartney's work. Bruce Eder of AllMusic identifies the song as a \"near-classic\" written by Harrison during a period when his association with the Rickenbacker guitar had helped define the folk rock sound of groups such as the Byrds. In a 2002 review of \"Rubber Soul\", for \"Mojo\", Richard Williams admired the track as \"a little gem, an early classic of power pop which lasts not a second too long\".\n\nDoug Collette of All About Jazz describes \"If I Needed Someone\" and \"Think for Yourself\" as \"his most stylish tunes\" and examples of Harrison's rise within the Beatles, although he highlights the guitarist's use of sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" as a more creatively important contribution. In his article celebrating the 50th anniversary of \"Rubber Soul\", Rob Sheffield identifies the album as the work on which the Beatles became true recording artists. He cites \"If I Needed Someone\" as one of the tracks that, in their focus on modern, independent-thinking women, presented \"complex and baffling females, much like the ones the Beatles ended up with in real life\".\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald recognises the song as having been influenced \"far more\" by Indian classical music than by the Byrds. While he views it as Harrison's \"most successful song\" up to 1965, MacDonald considers that the lack of contrast between the verses and the bridges renders the track \"monotonous\", revealing an \"obstinate quality\" that typifies much of Harrison's writing. Tim Riley disagrees, instead recognising that the bridge \"sets things in motion\" compared to the verse's \"ebb and flow\". In addition to admiring the group's performance, particularly the restraint Starr employs to resolve the tension created by the VII chord change, Riley describes \"If I Needed Someone\" as \"every guitarist's hook-bound fantasy\". Writing in Barry Miles' book \"The Beatles Diary\", Peter Doggett considers it to be Harrison's best song \"by far\" up to that point, and he describes the group's harmony singing as \"stunning\" and \"the tightest they'd yet achieved on record\". In 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"If I Needed Someone\" at number 51 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\".\n\nAside from the Hollies, several artists covered \"If I Needed Someone\" soon after the Beatles recorded it. Stained Glass released the song as their first single – a version that \"Billboard\" magazine described as an \"impressive debut\" and \"an exciting off-beat ballad\". Having struggled to maintain their relevance against British Invasion bands, the Kingsmen recorded the song with an arrangement that authors Stuart Shea and Robert Rodriguez recognise as \"a prototypically American response to British folk\". This version, which failed to chart in the US when issued as a single, later appeared on the group's 1966 album \"Up and Away\". Other artists who recorded it in 1966 include the Cryan' Shames, for their debut album, \"Sugar and Spice\", and Hugh Masekela, who released it on \"Hugh Masekela's Next Album\" and went on to collaborate with the Byrds on their January 1967 single \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\".\nHarrison performed \"If I Needed Someone\" throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton, a version from which appeared on the 1992 album \"Live in Japan\". When discussing his choice of material for the tour, which was Harrison's first since his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, he told \"Billboard\" that the song was an obvious inclusion, given that the Beatles had played it during their only visit to Japan, in 1966. On this 1991 live version, in Inglis' description, Clapton's \"looping guitar solos\" complement Harrison's vocal, which is more prominent than on the Beatles' original and sung in the style of Dylan. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George, held at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\nAccording to press announcements prior to the release in December 2002, Roger McGuinn recorded \"If I Needed Someone\" for inclusion on the multi-artist Harrison tribute album \"\". The song did not appear on that release, but in 2004 McGuinn issued it as the opening track of his album \"Limited Edition\".<ref name=\"Griffith/News&Review\"></ref> In his book on the making of \"Rubber Soul\" and its legacy, Kruth describes McGuinn's cover as \"a supersonic reading\" from the \"master of the Rickenbacker twelve-string chime\". In interviews to promote \"Limited Edition\", McGuinn recalled Harrison's adaptation of the \"Bells of Rhymney\" riff as being \"kind of a cool cross-pollination\" and said that it was \"a great honor to have in some small way influenced our heroes the Beatles\".\n\nOther artists who have covered \"If I Needed Someone\" include James Taylor and the doom metal band Type O Negative. The latter included it with \"Day Tripper\" and \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" as part of a Beatles medley on their 1999 album \"World Coming Down\". In 2005, Nellie McKay recorded the song in the lounge jazz style for the multi-artist compilation \"This Bird Has Flown: A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles' Rubber Soul\". The English folk duo Show of Hands have also covered the song, incorporating Eastern instruments such as the tabla. Their version appeared on the 2006 compilation \"Rubber Folk\".\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, the line-up on the Beatles' recording was as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2249594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249594", "title": "The Nature of the Judicial Process", "text": "The Nature of the Judicial Process\n\nThe Nature of the Judicial Process is a legal classic written by Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and New York Court of Appeals Chief Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo in 1921. It was compiled from The Storrs Lectures delivered at Yale Law School earlier that year.\n\nThe central question of \"The Nature of the Judicial Process\" is how judges should decide cases. Cardozo's answer is that judges should do what they have always done in the Anglo-American legal tradition, namely, follow and apply the law in easy cases, and make new law in hard cases by balancing competing considerations, including the paramount value of social welfare. Cardozo identifies four leading methods of legal analysis: (1) the method of logic (or “analogy,” or “philosophy”), which seeks to extend legal principles in ways that preserve logical consistency; (2) the method of history (or “evolution”), which adverts to the historical origins of the legal rule or concept; (3) the method of custom (or “tradition”), which views social customs as helpful guides to community values and settled expectations; and (4) the method of sociology, which looks to considerations of reason, justice, utility, and social welfare. Each of these methods may have their “preponderating value” in particular cases. No simple test or rigid formula can decide which method should prevail in a given case. But in difficult cases where a legal rule is outmoded or the law contains “gaps” that must be filled, judges should frankly play the role of legislators and let “the welfare of society fix the path.”\n\nCardozo admits that there are risks in judicial lawmaking. To minimize these, he points to a number of factors that significantly limit judicial discretion. First, judges may make new law only “interstitially,” that is, when the law contains gaps or a legal rule is clearly obsolete. Second, judges in their exercise of judicial review should never strike down a law unless it is “so plainly arbitrary and oppressive that right-minded men and women could not reasonably regard” it otherwise. Finally, when judges invoke norms such as “reason,” “justice,” or “social advantage” when employing the method of sociology, they should look to community standards rather than to their own personal values. In the Anglo-American system of law, Cardozo remarks, a judge “is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness.” In the final balance, a judge's freedom to innovate is insignificant “compared with the bulk and pressure of the rules that hedge him on every side.”\n\nIn claiming that judges do and must make law, Cardozo was siding with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Roscoe Pound, John Chipman Gray, and other American “proto-realists” of his day who were challenging the traditional “oracular” or “mechanical” or “formalist” view of judicial reasoning. On that view, judges never make law, they simply discover pre-existing law and apply it. According to strict formalists, there are no hard cases where the law is silent, or ambiguous, or vague, or contradictory, or couched in broad generalities. Rather, the law is clear, consistent, and complete; all legal questions have a single correct answer; and judges are (in Blackstone's phrase) “living oracles” who deduce inexorable legal conclusions from indisputable legal axioms.\n\nFormalism was not Cardozo's only target in \"The Nature of the Judicial Process\". He also attacked radical critics of formalism, such as John Chipman Gray, who claimed that judges have immense freedom and rejected the very idea of law as a set of binding rules. Gray and other proto-realists of the time tried to demystify law and view it with hard-headed pragmatism. They argued that since judges are the ultimate arbiters of law, “law” in the final analysis is whatever judges say it is (or what they predictably will say it is in the future). Cardozo argued that this isn't an “analysis” of law, but a denial that any true law exists. The proto-realists confuse right with power. Judges may have the power to ignore settle legal standards, but they do not have the right. Moreover, the attempt to identify law with judicial rulings ignores the fact that the great majority of legal questions have clear, uncontroversial answers that guide everyday conduct and are never litigated in courts.\n\n\"The Nature of the Judicial Process\" established Cardozo “as one of the leading jurists of his time” and “has become a classic of legal education.\" Its continuing appeal is due, in part, to its self-effacing tone, its lapidary prose, and its attempt to strike a happy medium between legal formalism and radical realist theories that wholly reject traditional views of law, legal reasoning, judicial restraint, and the rule of law.\n\nThe great success of Cardozo's \"The Nature of the Judicial Process\" created demand for further reflections on the law. In two later works, \"The Growth of Law\" (1924) and \"The Paradoxes of Legal Science\" (1927), Cardozo refined, deepened, and to some extent modified the views of law laid out in \"The Nature of the Judicial Process\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was written primarily by John Lennon, though credited to Lennon–McCartney.\n\nThe song's lyrics establish a threatening tone towards the singer's unnamed girlfriend (referred to throughout the song as \"little girl\"), claiming \"I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man.\" The line was taken from an early Elvis Presley song, \"Baby Let's Play House\" (written by Arthur Gunter).\n\nLennon revisited this theme in a more apologetic fashion with his post-Beatles song \"Jealous Guy\".\n\n\"Run for Your Life\" was the first song recorded for \"Rubber Soul\", on 12 October 1965; \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" was also recorded later that day. The song has only one section, a verse-refrain combination, with the guitar duet introducing a six-bar blues. As with most other songs on \"Rubber Soul\", McCartney sings the higher register of the three-part harmony.\n\n\"Rubber Soul\" was released on 3 December 1965, with \"Run for Your Life\" sequenced as the album's closing song. Since release, the song has garnered a mixed response from music critics. Lennon designated it as his \"least favorite Beatles song\" in a 1973 interview and later said it was the song he most regretted writing. He also stated that it was one of George Harrison's favourites on \"Rubber Soul\" at that time, despite Lennon's dislike of it. Ian MacDonald criticised the vocal performance and added these comments about the guitar: \"The guitar-work, some of which is badly out of tune, is similarly rough, the piercingly simplistic blues solo suggesting that the player was not Harrison but Lennon himself.\" Thomas Ward of AllMusic similarly criticised the song, calling it \"arguably the weakest\" on \"Rubber Soul\", and one of the \"lesser items in the entire Lennon–McCartney songbook.\" Ward further criticised the song's lyrics, calling them \"trite\", and the melody, calling it \"bland and uninteresting.\" While he did compliment Lennon's vocal performance and Harrison's \"lovely\" guitar part, they can't rescue the song from being \"one of the Beatles most dispensable items.\"\n\n\nA 1966 version of \"Run for Your Life\" performed by Nancy Sinatra was released on her album \"Boots\". Although it did not chart nationally, this version experienced regional success at such stations as WPTR in Albany, New York.\n\nThe song was also recorded by Gary Lewis & the Playboys on their album \"She's Just My Style,\" which was released in March 1966. Johnny Rivers also released the song in 1966 on his live album \"...And I Know You Wanna Dance\". Thee Headcoatees also covered it on their album \"Girlsville\" in 1991.\n"}

Three different versions were developed to suit three different platform capabilities, each with a markedly different gameplay. The Amiga/Atari ST version was released in 1991, as was the ZX Spectrum/Amstrad CPC version, while the Nintendo Entertainment System version was released in 1992.\n\nThe NES version of the game has five levels, each of which are divided into two different types of stages. The first stage involves controlling the international teen heroes (Planeteers) flying their Eco-Jet to an enemy fortress, while trying to avoid the instant death that occurs by touching any of the scenery or getting hit by the various projectiles or birds. The second stage involves controlling Captain Planet himself as he fights his way to an ecovillain from the TV series.\n\nThe NES version features levels set in the Yellowstone National Park, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa and Antarctica.\n\nThe Amiga/Atari version has five stages, one for each Planeteer, and a final stage in which Captain Planet could be controlled. Each Planeteer stage has at least one objective, while some had two: to clean up pollution using the Planeteer's magic ring power, and/or to rescue a particular type of animal with the aid of one of the Planeteer vehicles.

The final level allows the player to control Captain Planet, who must be navigated to the end of the stage by using and swapping powers held in bubbles throughout the level, before defeating one of the ecovillans, which is either Hoggish Greedly, Dr. Blight and her computer MAL, Looten Plunder and his assistant Argos Bleak, or Duke Nukem.\n"}
{"id": "2249628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249628", "title": "Self (novel)", "text": "Self (novel)\n\nSelf is a novel by Yann Martel. It tells the story of a traveling writer who wakes up one morning to discover that he has become a woman. It was first published by Knopf Canada in 1996.\n\nThe narrator, at first male, explains various events from his early childhood, living with a traveling family who finally settle in Ottawa, Ontario. He goes on to explain events from his years in private school (including his parents' death), until he graduates and travels to Portugal, where he, on his eighteenth birthday, wakes up as a female.\n\nSurprisingly unfazed by her transformation, the narrator concludes her trip and begins university back in the fictional Roetown. She begins writing, and keeps travel in her life, eventually visiting such places as Spain and Thailand, to name a few. She shares romances with a select few — males and females alike. Eventually she gets published, and after graduating, moves to Montreal, where she gets a job as a waitress while continuing to write. At her job she meets Tito, her final love. But as the novel is nearing a conclusion, she is suddenly raped by a vicious neighbour in her secluded apartment and her body reverts to being a male again.\n\nMartel described \"Self\" as the crucible of a thematic interest in religious faith that later informed his second work, \"Life of Pi\". Martel also reported in interviews that in writing the book's rape scene he contemplated the relationship between religion and evil: \"It made me think about how people live with evil. What interested me in religion is its claim to go beyond the bounds of human existence.\" Some reviewers noted an autobiographical strand in the book, whose hero is, like Martel, the child of Canadian diplomats and a writer achieving recognition at a young age. It is set partly in Peterborough, Ontario, where Martel was a student at Trent University.\n\n\"Self\" was Martel's first novel, and followed the publication in 1993 of \"The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios\", his first collection of short stories. The novel, in Martel's own words, initially \"vanished quickly and quietly\", though it was shortlisted for the 21st Chapters/Books In Canada First Novel Award, then Canada's most valuable first-novel award with a prize of 5,000 Canadian dollars.\n\nMore critical attention fell upon the book when Martel's second novel, \"Life of Pi\", won the 2002 Man Booker Prize. A reviewer for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", noting that Martel himself had called the novel \"terrible\" and expressed a wish that it \"disappear\", agreed that the work suffered from a \"serious crisis of identity\", and lacked the power of \"Life of Pi\". The \"Montreal Mirror\" went further, calling \"Self\" \"lame... A pastiche of autobiography and post-modern plot twists, it was haunted by an off-putting tone of smug precociousness.\" The \"Toronto Star\" reviewer objected to \"Self\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s protagonist's \"self-satisfied air\", but praised the work for its deft touch and compelling narrative. A writer in \"The Independent\" described the book's handling of gender change as \"crude confusion\", while \"The Hindu\" described the book as \"interesting ideas juxtaposed against not-so-inspiring writing\".\n\nMartel received in 1991 a grant of $18,000 from the Canada Council to write \"Self\", which was published in Canada in 1996, with a British launch the same November.\n\n"}

It ceased operations in early 2008.\n\nNew College's main campus was housed in several buildings in the Mission District in San Francisco. The offices at 777 Valencia, and companion buildings across the street, were home to its Humanities-based programs, including the Humanities BA, Mathematics, Poetics, Writing and Consciousness, Media Studies, Graduate Psychology, Experimental Performance Institute, Women’s Spirituality MA, as well as a broadcast studio and administration offices. New College of California School of Law was located at 50 Fell Street in the city's Civic Center. The North Bay Campus in Culture Ecology and Sustainable was housed in Santa Rosa, California, in a building owned by the Arlene Francis Foundation, a private foundation run by Peter Gabel, former president of New College and Arlene Francis's son. The Science and Math Institute classes were held at the Southern California University of Health Sciences in Whittier, California, within of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThis concentration of power in the hands of a small group—characterized by the absence of democratic governing structures and the lack of effective oversight by the Board—was an important factor in the Western Association of Schools and Colleges', or WASC's, decisions to impose sanctions on the college through much of the school's history. WASC actions and criticism periodically resulted in short-lived reforms that were invariably dismantled by the administration after the accrediting agency eased its scrutiny—a pattern that was repeated several times during the school's history. The pattern itself was criticized by WASC when it sanctioned the college in July 2007, months prior to the revocation of accreditation.\n\nThroughout the college's history, groups of faculty, students, alumni and staff mounted challenges to the school's autocratic governance systems, but these efforts failed to achieve lasting change. Numerous campaigns by faculty groups seeking democratic reform, often based in specific academic programs, had no more than limited, short-term influence. Unionization by the staff and some faculty—initially by the college's staff and the Law School core faculty in 1996, followed by the Humanities BA and Poetics MA faculties several years later—led to modest economic gains, but had no significant influence on college governance. Several waves of student organizing over the course of the college's history, addressing a variety of issues at different times, were consistent in seeking a greater voice for students in college governance. Student efforts, which sometimes included complaints to WASC, were also unable to achieve lasting change.\n\nWhen WASC imposed severe sanctions against the college in July 2007, the core faculty tried to move the school toward greater democracy and accountability by forming a college-wide Faculty Council, an effort that drew praise from the accrediting agency. WASC credited the Faculty Council and the school's new academic leadership for making improvements in the academic affairs of the college. Adjunct faculty, students and alumni also formed new organizations seeking democratic change.\n\nIn the end, the school's financial collapse undermined possibilities of democratic reform—and sealed the fate of the college. New College lost its accreditation in February 2008 and was declared \"closed\" by the California Department of Education effective December 20, 2007.\n\nDuring the week of July 16, 2007, New College held a school-wide faculty meeting. The full-time faculty formed a Core Faculty Council, which met and gave a vote of no confidence in President Martin Hamilton. The part-time faculty formed an Adjunct Faculty Council, and the students formed a Student Council. Alumni and alumnae decided to form an Independent Alumni/ae Association. On August 5, 2007, President Martin Hamilton resigned.\n\nIn August 2007, Luis Molina, a former Board member with no other experience in leading educational institutions, was made Acting President of the college. Expectations that the Board would hire a new Interim President never materialized. Francisco Leite, a former university administrator from Brazil who Martin Hamilton met while contracting an exchange program with UNAES, became Chief Financial Officer. Though initially Martin Hamilton remained on the Board after he was forced to resign as President, he, along with Peter Gabel, was ultimately forced out. The interim administrators hired an educational consultant and team (including director of financial aid and registrar), whose efforts drew praise from the accrediting body and the faculty, to help bring the college into compliance with accreditation standards of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).\n\nIn October 2007, without any notice, the administration stopped paying faculty and staff. Faculty continued teaching out the semester without pay. Law School faculty continued teaching through the spring semester based on false promises that pay would be forthcoming at the start of the semester. The College presently owes its faculty and staff millions of dollars in back pay. In July 2008, the college acknowledged its debts in agreements it signed to settle wage claim disputes filed with the Department of Industrial Relations. A number of creditors of the college have prevailed in lawsuits.\n\nAccreditation was revoked in February 2008 by WASC for numerous violations, including lack of proper governing structure, failure to keep proper student records, and lack of oversight by the Board. WASC is the accrediting body for colleges and universities in California.\n\nAt the end of 2007, after discovering improprieties in the financial aid office, the Department of Education placed the college on \"heightened cash monitoring\" which meant that federal financial aid funds would only be disbursed after New College's paperwork passed a review. The financial aid staff hired by Molina and Leite were unable to fix the files, which were in complete disarray, to conform to DOE standards, and DOE investigation also revealed that the school failed to keep required records and could not account for large amounts of federal financial aid funds. As a result, DOE revoked New College's eligibility to receive federal financial aid funds.\n\nStudents of the New College of California School of Law transferred to John F. Kennedy University Law School in April 2008.\n\nThe Women’s Spirituality MA program transferred to the Institute if Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto in May 2008.\n\nThe North Bay Campus' Green MBA moved to Dominican University of California in March 2007.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2249633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249633", "title": "The Flying Saucer", "text": "The Flying Saucer\n\nThe Flying Saucer is a 1950 independently made American black-and-white science fiction spy film drama, written by Howard Irving Young, from an original story by Mikel Conrad who also produced, directed, and stars with Pat Garrison and Hantz von Teuffen. The film was distributed in the United States by Film Classics Inc. \"The Flying Saucer\" was re-released in 1953 in the U.S. by Realart Pictures Inc., as a double-feature with \"Atomic Monster\", the retitled-reissue of \"Man Made Monster\", originally released in 1941 by Universal Pictures.\n\n\"The Flying Saucer\" is the first feature film to deal with the (then) new and hot topic of flying saucers. Flying saucers, or alien craft shaped like flying disks or saucers, were first identified and given the popular name on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported nine silvery, crescent-shaped objects flying in tight formation. A newspaper reporter coined the snappy tagline, \"flying saucers\", which captured the public's imagination. The film has no relationship and should not be confused with the later Ray Harryhausen science fiction film \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\", released by Columbia Pictures.\nAmerican Intelligence officials learn that Soviet spies have begun exploring a remote region of the Alaskan Territory in search of answers to the worldwide reports of \"flying saucers\". A wealthy American playboy, Mike Trent (Mikel Conrad), who was raised in that remote region, is recruited by intelligence officer Hank Thorn (Russell Hicks) to assist a Secret Service agent in exploring that area to discover what the Soviets may have found.\n\nTo his pleasant surprise, Mike discovers the agent is an attractive woman named Vee Langley (Pat Garrison); they set off together and slowly become mutually attracted to each other. Their cover story is that Mike is suffering from a nervous breakdown and she is his private nurse. At Mike's family's wilderness lodge, they are met by a foreign-accented caretaker named Hans (Hantz von Teuffen), new to the job.\n\nMike is very skeptical of the flying saucer reports until he spots one flying over the lodge. Assorted complications ensue until Mike and Vee finally discover that Hans is one of the Soviet agents who is trying to acquire the flying saucer. It turns out that the saucer is an invention of American scientist Dr. Laughton (Roy Engel). But Turner (Denver Pyle), Laughton's assistant, is a communist sympathizer and has other ideas; he tries to make a deal to sell the saucer to the Soviets for one million dollars.\n\nMike's trip to Juneau to see old friends, including Matt Mitchell (Frank Darrien), is ill-advised; when Vee tracks him down he is in the company of a bar girl, named Nanette (Virginia Hewitt). Matt gets mixed up with the Soviet agents who are trying to obtain control of the saucer. When he tries to strike a bargain with ring leader Colonel Marikoff (Lester Sharpe), at the spy's headquarters, Matt is knocked unconscious.\n\nHe is able to escape and seeks out Mike, but they are attacked by the Soviets, who kill Matt. Before he dies, however, Matt reveals the location of the saucer: Twin Lakes. Mike rents an aircraft and flies to where the saucer is hidden at an isolated cabin. After flying back to his lodge, he tries to find Vee, who has tried to spirit Lawton away; the trio are captured by the turncoat Taylor and a group of Soviet agents. The Soviets lead their prisoners through a secret tunnel hidden under the glacier; an avalanche begins and wipes them out. Mike, Vee, and Lawton escape the tunnel just in time to see Turner fly off in the saucer; it suddenly explodes in mid-air, due to a time bomb that Lawton had planted on board for such an eventuality. Their mission now accomplished, Mike and Vee embrace and kiss.\n\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Flying Saucer\" took place from late September to early October 1949 at Hal Roach Studios. Additional B-roll photography was shot in Alaska on location where, according to a September 21, 1949 article in the \"Los Angeles Examiner\", Mikel Conrad claimed to have obtained footage of actual flying saucers while shooting \"Arctic Manhunt\" in Alaska in the winter of 1947.\n\nThe opening prologue appears before the onscreen credits and states: \"We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of those in authority who made the release of the 'Flying Saucer' film possible at this time.\" The message obliquely alluded to some authorized government films of flying saucers. None of that footage was actually included in \"The Flying Saucer\".\n\n\"The Flying Saucer\" did not rise above its B film origins; its low budget production doomed it to the bottom end of theater playbills and drive-ins. \"The New York Times\" film critic Bosley Crowther observed: \"A film called 'The Flying Saucer' flew into the Rialto yesterday and, except for some nice Alaskan scenery, it can go right on flying, for all we care. In fact, it is such a clumsy item that we doubt if it will go very far, and we hesitate, out of mercy, to fire even a critical shot at it\".\n\nAll rights to \"The Flying Saucer\" have been owned worldwide and in perpetuity since 1977 by Wade Williams. Copyright was renewed on November 29, 1977 (R 677308), Library of Congress Copyright Office.\n\n\n"}

His early work preceded both the M1 Garand (of 1933), and the later M1 Carbine, AK-47, and M16 series.\n\nBorn in 1894 in Fedotovo, Simonov began work in a foundry immediately after completing his elementary school studies. By the end of World War I, after completing a basic technician's course of instruction, he began working on a pioneering automatic rifle designed by Vladimir Grigoryevich Fyodorov, the Federov Avtomat. After the Russian Revolution, Simonov continued further at the Moscow Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1924 to work at Russia's giant Tula Arsenal. By 1926 he had become a quality-control inspector at Tula, and by 1927, had been promoted into the Soviet Design and Development Department where he worked directly under Fyodorov. The Simonov AVS-36, which entered service in the 1930s would see service in the early part of World War II, up to about 1940 or so where it was replaced by other semi-automatic designs.\n\nDuring World War II, Simonov designed some firearms of his own; a submachine gun which did not enter production, and a self-loading anti-tank rifle, the 14.5×114mm PTRS, which went on to form the basis — in scaled-down form - of the SKS. An earlier semi-automatic rifle, the AVS-36, was hindered by official insistence on using the powerful 7.62×54mmR, which was at that point standard amongst Russian rifles. Unfortunately, as had been demonstrated with the Fedor Tokarev's SVT-40, the rim of the 7.62×54mmR was detrimental to the rapid, reliable function of a semi-automatic rifle. The design was proven with the 14.5×114mm PTRS-41 ammo. The SKS could have been scaled to fire the 7.62×54mmR. The power just wasn't needed.\n\nBy 1943, advances in thinking - and confirmed data showed engagements took place between 100 meters to 300 meters — led to the adoption of a shorter, less powerful round, the 7.62×39mm M1943 (also known as \"7.62 Soviet\" or \"7.62 short\" to differentiate it from several other rounds in 7.62 mm calibre). Field trials of the new rifle proved the weapon and, in 1944 a pre-production run of the SKS went to the Belorussian Offensive for battlefield trials. After some tweaking, it was officially adopted and designated the \"7.62 Samozaryadnyi Karabin Sistemy Simonova Obrazets 1945 g.\" (translated, \"7.62 Self-loading Carbine System Simonov model year 1945\") or SKS-45, and chosen as the ideal replacement for the SVT-40.\n\n\n\n"}

Reid\n\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989), is a US copyright law and labor law case of a United States Supreme Court case regarding ownership of copyright.\n\nThe Community for Creative Non-Violence, a homeless charity, paid a sculptor called James Earl Reid for a statue that depicted the plight of homeless people for a Christmas pageant in Washington DC, called \"Third World America\". CCNV members visited Reid's Baltimore studio as he made the statue, gave suggestions and directions about its appearance. CCNV paid Reid the final installment on delivery. They had not discussed copyright in the sculpture. They both filed competing certificates.\n\nThe District Court held that CCNV had the copyright, as it was a ‘work made for hire’ under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. § 101, owned exclusively by CCNV under § 201(b). This vests copyright ownership of works for hire in the employer or other person for whom the work is prepared, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, held the sculpture was not a ‘work made for hire’ because Reid was not an employee, but an independent contractor. However it remanded to the lower court to determine if the statue's copyright was co-owned under §201(a)\n\nJustice Thurgood Marshall giving the court's opinion, the Supreme Court held Reid was an independent contractor, not an employee, so the work was not \"made for hire\" under §101, and the copyright belonged to Reid, at least in part.\n\nThe Court determined that Reid's commission was not \"specially ordered or commissioned\" under paragraph 2 of 17 USC 101's \"work made for hire\" definition. It then considered whether Reid was an \"employee\" preparing the sculpture \"within the scope of his employment\", whose work fell within \"work made for hire\", or an independent contract whose work did not fall within \"work made for hire\".\n\nThe Court held that common law agency principles should be applied to decide whether a work is made by an employee or an independent contractor. While the statute was silent on the meaning of \"employee,\" Congress could be inferred to have wanted to incorporate agency law definitions, as it also referred to the term \"scope of employment\" that agency law uses. The general common law of agency must be used over the law of any particular state, in order to create a uniform, nationwide law.\n\nThe Court listed 11 factors in determining whether someone is an independent contractor or an employee. \nIn determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency, we consider the hiring party's right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished. Among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are [1] the skill required; [2] the source of the instrumentalities and tools; [3] the location of the work; [4] the duration of the relationship between the parties; [5] whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party; [6] the extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work; [7] the method of payment; [8] the hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants; whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party; [9] whether the hiring party is in business; [10] the provision of employee benefits; [11] and the tax treatment of the hired party.\n\nBased on these factors, the Court held Reid was an independent contractor. Reid supplied his own tools, was without any extensive supervision and was free in the way he met his deadlines. CCNV could not assign more projects to Reid, and paid him in the normal manner independent contractors are done.\n\nThe case was remanded to determine whether CCNV could still be regarded as a joint author of the sculpture and co-owner of the copyright, if the District Court determined that the parties intended their contributions be merged into a unitary whole.\n\nWhile the case was pending on remand, Mitch Snyder of CCNV died. The parties subsequently filed a “Joint Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment.” The consent judgment has the following terms:\n\n\nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 1991 WL 415523 (D.D.C. 1991).\n\nIn \"Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v.

{"id": "2249670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249670", "title": "Ormonde (horse)", "text": "Ormonde (horse)\n\nOrmonde (1883–1904) was an English Thoroughbred racehorse who won the English Triple Crown in 1886 and retired undefeated. He also won the St. James's Palace Stakes, Champion Stakes and the Hardwicke Stakes twice. At the time he was often labelled as the 'horse of the century'. Ormonde was trained at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. His regular jockeys were Fred Archer and Tom Cannon. After retiring from racing he suffered fertility problems, but still sired Orme, who won the Eclipse Stakes twice.\n\nOrmonde was a bay colt, bred by Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster and foaled in 1883 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. Ormonde's sire was The Derby and Champion Stakes winner Bend Or, also bred by the Duke. Bend Or was a successful stallion, his progeny included Kendal, Ossory, Orbit, Orion, Orvieto, Bona Vista and Laveno.\n\nOrmonde's dam was Doncaster Cup winner Lily Agnes. She was sired by another Derby winner, Macaroni. Lily Agnes began to experience problems with her lungs as a four-year-old, to the extent that jockey John Osborne said he could hear her approaching before he saw her. The problem did not interfere with her racing ability as she continued to win at four and five. She then became a top broodmare also foaling 1000 Guineas winner Farewell, Ormonde's full-brother Ossory and another full-brother Ornament, who produced the outstanding Sceptre, the only racehorse to win four British Classic Races outright.\n\nOrmonde was born at half-past six in the evening of 18 March 1883. The Duke's stud-groom Richard Chapman stated that for several months after foaling, Ormonde was over at the knee. Chapman later said he had never before or since seen a horse with the characteristic so pronounced and that it had seemed impossible for him to ever grow straight. Ormonde did gradually grow out of the problem though and by the time he left the stud to go into training at Kingsclere, trainer John Porter told the Duke he was the best yearling the Duke had sent him. However during the winter of 1884/85, Ormonde had trouble with his knees. The treatment he received for this held his training back considerably, with him only having easy cantering exercises until the summer of 1885.\n\nOrmonde grew into a well-built horse standing with excellent bone and straight hocks. Porter later said his neck \"was the most muscular I ever saw a Thoroughbred possess.\" He had an excellent shoulder and short powerful hindquarters that led some to call him a racing machine. When galloping, he held his head low and had a notably long stride. He had a kind temperament, healthy appetite and strong constitution. Porter stated the horse was fond of flowers and would even eat the boutonniere from the jacket of anyone within reach.\n\nPrior to his racecourse debut, Porter ran Ormonde in a trial against Kendal, Whipper-in and Whitefriar. Kendal, carrying one pound less, won the trial by a length from Ormonde. Kendal had already had a number of races by this point and Ormonde was nowhere near fully fit. By this point he stood 16 hands high and had a very muscular neck and strong back. Porter also noted that when extended, Ormonde had a very long stride. The Duke rode him in a couple of canters and remarked \"\"I felt every moment that I was going to be shot over his head, his propelling power is so terrific.\"\"\n\nAs a two-year-old, Ormonde did not race until October when he won the Post Sweepstakes race at Newmarket. He started at 5/4 with the filly Modwena, who had won eight races out of ten that year, the 5/6 favourite. In the heavy going, Ormonde went on to win by a length from Modwena. Ormonde's next racecourse appearance came in the Criterion Stakes, again at Newmarket, where his opposition included Oberon and Mephisto. Starting at 4/6, Ormonde won easily by three lengths from Oberon, with Mephisto a distant third. He then started the Dewhurst Plate as the 4/11 favourite, ridden by Fred Archer. After an even start, Ormonde was positioned just behind the leader. As they neared the closing stages, Archer let Ormonde go and he quickly pulled away from the field to beat his stablemate, Whitefriar, easily by four lengths. The field also included Miss Jummy, who went on to win the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks. These three victories earned him £3008. 1885 was considered to have had the best group of two-year-olds for many years.\n\nGoing into the 1886 season, Ormonde was one of the favourites for the Derby. He was priced at 11/2, similar to Minting, Saraband and The Bard.\n\nOrmonde started off his three-year-old campaign in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. The race was considered a clash between Ormonde, the unbeaten Middle Park winner Minting and Saraband. In a small field of six, Minting was sent off the 11/10 favourite, Saraband at 3/1 and Ormonde at 7/2. This time Ormonde was ridden by George Barrett, with Fred Archer riding Saraband. The horses ran almost in line in the early stages. Saraband began to struggle and was beaten with two furlongs to run. At this point Ormonde and Minting took over the lead from St. Mirin. Ormonde then went on to record as easy 2 length victory over Minting, with Mephisto a further 10 lengths back in third, who in turn was two lengths ahead of Saraband.\nAfter his Newmarket performance, Ormonde was the favourite for the Derby with Fred Archer back as his jockey. A small field of 9 went to post, with Ormonde the 40/85 favourite and his main opposition, The Bard, at 7/2 who. The Bard was also undefeated and had won many races as a two-year-old. The start was not even, with outsider Coracle almost 6 lengths clear of Ormonde, who was a similar distance clear of the rest. Ormonde and The Bard took over the lead at Tattenham corner and the two raced up the straight. The Bard got a neck in front, but when Archer asked Ormonde for an effort, he pulled in front to win by 1½ lengths from The Bard, with St. Mirin a further 10 lengths back in third.\n\nAt Royal Ascot against just two opponents, Ormonde lined up as the 3/100 favourite for the St. James's Palace Stakes. He won easily by ¾ length from Calais. Three days later he faced a stronger field in the Hardwicke Stakes including 1885 Derby and St Leger winner Melton. Ormonde, the 30/100 favourite, won easily again though, beating Melton by 2 lengths. He then had a break from the racecourse. After Ascot Ormonde was already as short as 1/2 for the St Leger.\n\nWhile Ormonde was galloping one morning shortly before the St Leger Stakes, Porter noticed him making a whistling noise. In spite of this infirmity, Ormonde started the final classic of the year as the 1/7 favourite. Ridden again by Archer, he pulled away half a mile out and won easily by 4 lengths from St. Mirin, without even being asked for an effort. The win made him the fourth winner of the English Triple Crown.\n\nHe next ran in the Great Foal Stakes at Newmarket, again winning easily by three lengths from Mephisto. He then won the Newmarket St Leger in a walkover and the Champion Stakes as the 1/100 favourite by a length from Oberon. Ormonde then entered a free handicap at Newmarket. Starting the 1/7 favourite and carrying 9 st 2 lb, he won by eight lengths from Mephisto, to whom he was conceding 28 lbs. At the same meeting he won a private sweepstakes in a walkover. The sweepstakes was an originally scheduled as a match race between Ormonde, The Bard, Melton and possibly Bendigo, the 1886 Eclipse winner. Bendigo was not nominated from the race in the end. The Bard and Melton were though and both forfeited £500 to Ormonde's connections. Throughout the end of the season, Ormonde's breathing had become progressively louder until he was labelled a roarer.<tbheritage />\n\nOrmonde did not race until June 1887. His return was assisted by an experimental treatment involving \"galvanic shocks\" being applied daily to his chest and throat. His reappearance came at Royal Ascot in the Rous Memorial Stakes, where his opposition included Kilwarlin, who went on to win the season's St. Leger Stakes. Ormonde was conceding 25 pounds to Kilwarin and before the race Kilwarin's owner Captain Machell said to Porter, \"The horse was never foaled that could give Kilwarin 25 pounds and beat him.\" After Fred Archer's suicide, Tom Cannon was now Ormonde's jockey. He led the race throughout and won easily by six lengths from Kilwarlin, with Agave a distant third. Upon seeing Captain Machell in the paddock after the race Porter said, \"Well, what did you think of it now?\" Machell replied, \"Ormonde is not a horse at all; he's a damned steam-engine.\"\n\nHe raced again the next day in the Hardwicke Stakes, where he faced a strong field including Minting and Eclipse Stakes winner Bendigo. Minting's trainer Matt Dawson was confident that his horse could win this time due to Ormonde's breathing problems. As the four runners made their way to the starting post he remarked to Porter \"You will be beaten today, John. No horse afflicted with Ormonde's infirmity can hope to beat Minting.\" Indeed, Porter himself admitted he was not overly confident of victory. During the race George Barrett, aboard Phil, impeded Ormonde and he was made to struggle for the first time in his career. During the closing stages, Ormonde and Minting battled with each other and Ormonde just came out on top, winning by a neck, with Bendigo in third.\n\nIn his final race, he won the 6 furlong Imperial Gold Cup at Newmarket. Starting at 30/100 he made all the running and won by two lengths from Whitefriar.\n\nOrmonde was then retired as the most celebrated horse of his era. He was sent by train to Waterloo Station, then walked to Grosvenor House in Mayfair, where he was the guest of honor at a garden party to celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.\n\nOrmonde is generally considered one of the greatest racehorses ever. At the time he was often labelled as the 'horse of the century'. His achievements are even more impressive considering the strength of some of the other horses foaled in 1883. It is said that both Minting and The Bard were good enough to have won The Derby nine out of ten years. In early 1888 Minting, the horse Ormonde beat easily in the 2000 Guineas, was rated 15 pounds superior to the 1887 Derby winner Merry Hampton and the 1887 St Leger winner Kilwarlin.\n\nOrmonde went to the Duke of Westminster's Eaton Stud in 1888, where he sired seven foals from the sixteen mares he covered, including Goldfinch and Orme. In 1889, he was moved to Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket, but became sick and could only cover a few mares, with only one live foal produced in 1890. He was subsequently returned to Eaton Stud but his fertility never recovered. To the astonishment of many, Ormonde was then sold overseas. Both he and his dam were roarers, and the Duke felt this could weaken English bloodstock. Ormonde was sold to Senor Bocau of Argentina for £12,000, and then in 1893 to William O'Brien Macdonough, of California for £31,250. He stood at the Menlo Stock Farm in California for several years, where he sired 16 foals. including Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale.\n\n\"c = colt, f = filly\"\n\nDespite only siring eight horses in England, Ormonde had a signficant impact at stud. Orme was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland when he sired another Triple Crown winner, Flying Fox, who went on to be a leading sire in France. Orme also sired Epsom Derby winner Orby and 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm. Goldfinch sired 1000 Guineas winner Chelandry. After being sold and moving to California, Goldfinch sired Preakness Stakes winner Old England. In America, his son Ormondale went on to sire Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Purchase.\n\nOrmonde died in 1904 at age 21 at Rancho Wikiup in Santa Rosa, California. His disarticulated skeleton/skull were later returned to the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, London. His male line survives mainly through Teddy, grandson of Flying Fox. Orby does still have a sire line as well.\n\nOrmonde may have been the model for the fictional horse Silver Blaze in Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes short story \"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\" (1892).\n\n\"Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut\"\n\n"}

The original route served as a cutoff to the Sandusky Bay Bridge on SR 2 and SR 12 (modern-day U.S. Route 6).

It is affectionately known as one of the Parks, others including Parkview, Parkwood, Westcliff, Parktown North, Parkhurst and Forest Town. Parktown is one of Johannesburg's largest suburbs, neighbouring Hillbrow, Braamfontein and Milpark to the South; Berea and Houghton to the East; Killarney and Forest Town to the North, and Westcliff, Melville and Richmond to the West. Originally established by the Randlords in the 1890s, Parktown is now home to many businesses, hospitals, schools, churches and restaurants, whilst still maintaining quiet residential areas. It is also home to three of the five campuses of the University of the Witwatersrand including the education campus, medical school and Wits Business School. Parktown is now divided into Parktown and Parktown West with Jan Smuts Avenue forming the dividing line. It is located in Region F of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.\n\nIn 1890 Edouard Lippert bought a substantial tract of the Braamfontein Farm. He rebuilt the farm house located on a ridge and named it \"Marienhof\" after his wife, Marie. The ridge overlooked a massive plain and on this he planted the Sachsenwald Forest to supply the needs of the mines and fast developing city. He saw the promise that the ridge had for development as a township and partitioned the land into plots. In 1892, Lady Florence Phillips rode north from the dusty mining town of early Johannesburg and found the ridge. The view extended from Sachsenwald forest in the West to the Magaliesberg mountains and Pretoria in the North. She persuaded her husband to build a house there and Frank Emley was commissioned to build their mansion, Hohenheim. Parktown quickly became the new elite suburb. Soon, many wealthy entrepreneurs (see Randlord) were building mansions along the ridge, and showing off their newfound affluence with parties, croquet on the lawns, and lavish dinners.\n\nParktown was where many conspirators of the Jameson Raid against the South African Republic were based. Today the suburb is home to many Victorian and Edwardian homes, and a number of designs by Sir Herbert Baker. \n\nIn the late 1960s, 56 of the stately homes were demolished to make way for the Johannesburg College of Education (Now Wits Education Campus). In 1975 many more were demolished and properties reduced for the construction of the M1 motorway, a major artery running North to South through the center of the Northern suburbs of Johannesburg\n\nParktown West is the section of Parktown, West of Jan Smuts Avenue. It is almost entirely residential and famous for its beautiful avenues lined with Jacaranda and Plane trees, also known as the 'itchy ball tree'. Commerce is only permitted along the Western side of Jan Smuts Avenue. Parktown West was being developed as early as 1903 with significant increase in popularity in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn addition to Sir Herbert Baker, many other architects were influential in building this historical suburb, including Frank Emley, James Cope Christie, Francis Fleming and Charles Aburrow. Baker's Parktown houses drew influences from the Cape Dutch revival style, which he had mastered in the Cape and combined this with stone work using \"koppie stone\" which was quarried in the area, often from the grounds of the houses that he built. James Cope Christie's style is eclectic drawing strong influences from Victorian styles and Art Nouveau. Charles Aburrow's designs were strongly Victorian whilst Frank Emley favoured the Edwardian style.\n\nTransnet Freight Rail (previously Spoornet) has its head office in the Inyanda House in Parktown.\n\nThe Parktown Mansions tell many stories of the history of Johannesburg as they were the homes of some of the most influential residents of the early city. Whilst there are a number of mansions still standing in present day Parktown, a vast majority were destroyed during the late 1960s and 1970s to facilitate the construction of the M1 motorway and the increasing popularity of Parktown as a business district.\n\nRemaining Baker mansions in Parktown include Northwards, Villa Arcadia, Bishopskop, The Stonehouse and Brenthurst. Other important mansions include Dolobran designed by J.A. Cope Christie and North Lodge designed by J.H. Aldwyncle.\n\n\n\nModern-day Parktown and its surrounds form a centre of Arts and Culture in Johannesburg. The Linder Auditorium, located on the Wits Education Campus is home to the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Johannesburg's only full-time professional orchestra. Just next door, the Williams Block houses the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra Company. The Johannesburg Children's Theatre is across the Road from the Education Campus, housed in two Parktown mansions and the South African Ballet Theatre and South African Youth Ballet are a few blocks away in Braamfontein on the Johannesburg Theatre's property.\n\nParktown is also home to a diverse range of Churches including a Dutch Reform Church, a beautiful 1904 Baker and Masey Anglican church, St. Georges and the Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Temple Emanuel, one of Johannesburg's last remaining Jewish Reform Synagogues is also located in Parktown.\n\nThe Johannesburg Freemasons' Hall, home to many of Johannesburg oldest masonic lodges is also in Parktown.\n\n\n"}

It lies within the Ordos Plateau of the Yellow River. Although mainly rural, Ordos is administered as a prefecture-level city.\n\nOrdos is known for its large scale government projects undertaken recently including most prominently the new Kangbashi District, an urban district planned as a massive civic mall with abundant monuments, cultural institutions and other showpiece architecture. It was the venue for the 2012 Miss World Final.\n\nWhen it was newly built, the streets of the new Kangbashi district didn't have much activity and the district was frequently described as a \"ghost city\" by several Western media outlets. However, by 2017, Kangbashi had become more populated with a resident population of 153,000 and around one-third of apartments occupied. In a Forbes article, Wade Shepard noted that \"Of the 40,000 apartments that had been built in the new district since 2004, only 500 are still on the market.\n\nThe area had been administered under the Ih Ju League, also spelled Ikh Juu ( \"Yeke Juu ayimaγ\"; ) since the 17th century, and was redesignated a prefecture-level city and renamed to Ordos on 26 February 2001. \"Ordos\" means \"palaces\" in the Mongolian language. Ordos originally referred to a tribe belonging to the \"Yeke Juu\" (\"Ike Chao\" ‘great monastery’) league and later included the tribe's area, hence the Ordos, or Ordus, the area within the big bend of the Yellow River. Mongolian \"ordu\"(\"n\"), \"ord\" ‘court, residence of a ruler; palace; camp’, also for 'camp bodyguards'. According to Ramstedt -\"s\" is a plural suffix; further: \"ordu\", \"orda\"; Turkic \"orta\" ‘a center’; Mongolian > Turkish \"orda\" ‘camp’ > Hindi \"urdū\" > English \"horde.\" \nThe name is sometimes claimed to be related to the eight white yurts of Genghis Khan. Linguistically, the Ordos dialect of Mongolian is quite different from neighboring Chakhar Mongolian.\n\nAt the southern end of the Ordos grassland, there is a river originating from Dingbian County in northwestern Shaanxi, flowing through the Otog Banner and Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, and then flowing from the east of Batuwan Village into the territory of northern Shanxi, after converging with Xiangshui River. It flows into the Wuding River, a tributary of the Yellow River, to the southeast. In the loose Mu Us Sandyland, a “U” shaped river valley is washed out. This river is known as the Sarawusu River. Sara Wusu in Mongolian means thick yellow stream, which means that the river here is yellow all the year round; on both sides of the river is covered with swaying red willows, so people also call this river \"Hongliu River\". It is in this river. In 1922, the French Catholic priest Sang Zhihua first discovered a fossil of the \"Hetao People\" here. Since then, Chinese archaeologists have visited the site many times. A large number of cultural relics have been discovered, and as early as 35,000 years ago, \"Hetao people\" lived here. The material culture created by the “Hetao People” is now called “Salawusu Culture”. After a comprehensive analysis of geology, animal fossils and stone tools, the Sarawusu culture was identified as the late Paleolithic culture.\n\nHetao civilization is the product of the integration of grassland culture and Yellow River civilization. Its long-term development and complex transmutation process, especially the relationship with Urad and Ordos Mongolian culture, also illustrates the relationship between Hetao civilization and Yellow River civilization. Hetao culture is one of the important components of the mainstream culture of the northern grasslands. In the grassland culture, the Hetao culture is both a source and a stream. As a source, Hetao culture has a historical accumulation of symbiosis with the northern grassland culture. As a stream, it is different from the Mongolian classic culture in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, such as Hongshan culture and Khorchin Mongols culture. It has its unique development trend. In the origin of grassland culture, it is a source of the late Paleolithic period, which originated from the prosperity of ancient ethnic minorities. It was formed in the Qin, Han, Ming and Qing Dynasties, and it is a cultural system of modern and contemporary civilization. It is an independent unit culture circle of grassland culture and a complete regional cultural system, which plays an important role in the composition of grassland culture.\n\nBefore the Zhou Dynasty, it was a nomadic area such as the Guifang and Lin Hu. In the Warring States Period, it was the Yunzhong County of the Zhao State Territory, and later belonged to the Qin State. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty, it was the front line of the Xiongnu and Han wars. Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty set up the Shuofang County here. When Emperor Xuan of Han called the Huxie Chanyu to come, he became the residence of the Southern Xiongnu. Later, Hu Han lived in harmony, and the Uprising of the Five Barbarians broke out in the Western Jin Dynasty. Sixteen Kingdoms were the pre-Qin and post-Qin territory. The Northern Dynasties belonged to the Northern Wei Dynasty, the Western Wei Dynasty, and the Northern Zhou Dynasty. In the Sui and Tang Dynasties, they were all territories. In the Tang Dynasty, they were placed in the party, and the famous General Guo Ziyi once held this position. During the Anshi Rebellion, Emperor Suzong of Tang fled to this place.\n\nQin Zhidao was an important military road for Qin Shihuang to be supervised by Meng Tian from 212 BC to 210 BC. Qinzhidao starts from Yunyang Linguang Palace in the Xianyang military site, and goes to Jiuyuan County in the north. Qinzhidao passes through Ordos City, three Banners and one district, the Qinzhidao site protection unit is established in Ordos City. One of the northern border counties of the Han Dynasty, the Sufang County was set up in the Western Han Dynasty. In 127 BC (Yuanshou two years), Emperor Wu sent Wei Qing and Li Xi to send troops to attack the Xiongnu. Soldiers from Yunzhong County, west of Gaochun, and then westward to Fuli (now northern Gansu), regained the Hetao. The jurisdiction of the original Qin Dynasty (commonly known as \"New Qinzhong\"), and the Sufang County in the south of the Yin Mountain, has been identified in the northwestern part of the current Otog Banner.\n\nTongwan City is located at the junction of Ordos City and Jingbian, Shaanxi Province. It was the capital of the Daxia Kingdom during the Northern Dynasties and Sixteen Kingdoms 1500 years ago, In 407 AD, the Xiongnu leader Helian Bobo called himself “Tianwang, Great Chan Yu, occupied and located in the desert. The first year of Helian Bobo's kingdom called \"Fengxiang\", the 100,000 people of all ethnic groups, used the \"steaming dust to build the city\" method to build the capital in the south of the black water in the north of the SuFang (now Hongliu River). The city was built in 7 years. The city is 25 meters thick, with a height of 23.33 meters and a width of 11.16 meters.\n\nThe Chinese translation of \"Ordos\" is \"eight white rooms\". For the sake of easy understanding, it is generally translated as \"a large number of palaces\". When Genghis Khan passed through the present Ordos area in a march, the whip landed, and Genghis Khan sighed that the water and grass here was rich, and he said that he would be buried here after his death. In August 1227, Genghis Khan died on the way to Xixia. Genghis Khan's three sons, Wo Kuotai Khan, placed the coffin and relics of Genghis Khan in a white felt for worship, collectively known as the Eight White Room. When the time came to Kublai Khan, Yuanshizu, he stipulated the ceremonies and ritual rules of the Eighth Room, and promulgated the sacred ceremonies. He held sacrifices throughout the year and became a great sacrifice for the Mongol Empire. In the eight white rooms, Genghis Khan and several ladies' coffins formed three white rooms. Genghis Khan used saddles, bows and arrows, milk buckets, historical materials books and reincarnation white horses that had been sealed by Genghis Khan to form the other five white rooms. And ordered the Darwinites to be guarded by the generation and generation, the Eight White Room is the holy place for the Mongolian people to worship. The Chagan Suluk sacrifice is the big ritual of the Eight White Room in a year. Genghis Khan used the 981 horses to send to the heavens. And reincarnation of the white god horse with white satin hanging and offering. The Eight White Room is a movable hall and a symbol of the power of the Genghis Khan gold family.\n\nIn the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan entered the Central Plains, and the Eight White Room moved to the capital, Khanbaliq. In the 1750s, Mandulu Khan led the Ordos Department into the area south of the Yellow River. Eight white rooms moved to Ordos. Soon, the son of Mandulu Khan came to dominate the grasslands, betrayed the golden family of Genghis Khan, and controlled the eight white rooms in their hands. Until the beginning of the sixteenth century, Genghis Khan's fifteenth generation of Sun Batu Mengke unified Mongolian ministries, and the eight white rooms were re-owned in the Genghis Khan gold family.\n\nIn the town of Ejin Horo Banner, Ordos, Inner Mongolia, a division of the protecting mausoleum, composed of the elite warriors of the army and the ministries of the dynasty, has been guarding the Genghis Khan's spiritual account for 780 years. This team is known as \"Darkhad\" (Chinese means \"the sacred mission\"). From the day of the death of Genghis Khan, an elite division has been selected from the ministries and their descendants who have achieved outstanding achievements and are most loyal to Genghis Khan. They have taken on the mission of guarding and honoring the “God of Devotion”. This special force was later known as the \"Darkhad\" of the Genghis Khan. At present, the Darkhadness have more than 6,000 people. In the main hall, Darkhad, who is involved in the daily and major sacrifices, is called \"Ya Men Te\". They implement hereditary system, there are presiding rituals, playing music, singing and so on. The Darkhadness who work in the Genghis Khan's Mausoleum today receive monthly civil service standard wages.\n\nWang Ai Zhao\n\nWang Aizhao, also known as Yi Kezhao (Da Miao), according to historical records, Wang Aizhao is a grand scale; extremely spectacular temple, the temple covers an area of 50 acres, the temple has about 259 buildings, surrounded by 282 lama houses, The structure of building takes the essence of the two traditional styles of Tibetan and Chinese. Because of the grandeur of Wang Aizhao's architecture, the folks have always been known as the “East Tibet”. It is a pity that the Japanese army invaded Wang Aizhao in 1941, and the treasure was looted and fired to Wang Aizhao. At present, only Wang Aizhao's ruins, \"Wolongtugang\", has a small warehouse. The original classmate Lama Lobson Zimba is unwavering in this religion. He continues to read the Buddha in this small warehouse and concentrate on the practice.\n\nIn the sixth year of Qing Shunzhi (AD 1649), the Qing dynasty divided the Mongolian Ordos tribe into six Banners: the Ordos left-wing middle Banner (formerly the county king Banner), Ordos Left-wing front Banner (now Jungar Banner), the Ordos left-wing Banner (now the Dalat Banner), Ordos right-wing middle Banner (now Otog Banner), Ordos right-wing front Banner (now Uxin Banner), Ordos right wing Banner (now Hanggin), later, the addition of Ordos right wing before the Banner (formerly Zhasak Banner). Later, the Ordos' Six Banners have allied at Wang Ai Zhao, and named the Ikezhao League(Former name of Ordos city).\n\nThe Qing Dynasty was an important period in the history of China's population development. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, through the restoration and development of Kangxi, YongZheng, and Qianlong, three emperors, the population of the Qianlong Dynasty broke through the 300 million mark. The contradiction between people and land is sharp, and a large number of the poor in the Mainland are forced by life pressure. They migrated to the West(Ordos), the Guandong, and the Nanyang(South sea and island of China). \"Zou Xi Kou\" means that thousands of people from Shanxi, Shaanxi and other places have migrated to Ordos, Guihua(Hohhot), Tumut, and Chahar since the Qing Dynasty. \"Zou Xi Kou\" changed Mongolia's social structure, economic structure and way of life. Shanxi people account for a relatively high proportion of immigrants, bringing Shanxi's Jin culture to the central and western regions of Inner Mongolia.\n\nAfter the Republic of China, the special zone of Suiyuan was established, and later it was changed to Suiyuan Province, and Ikezhao League was established. After the Lugou Bridge Incident in 1937, Japan occupied most of northern China. In 1938, Inner Mongolia Bailing Temple, Guisui, Baotou and other places were successively lost. After the Japanese invaders occupied Baotou, they went to Ordos to coerce the princes of all ethnic groups and moved the eight white rooms of Genghis Khan to Baotou. At that time, the Iqzhao League leader Shagdur Zab and the flag princes vowed never to move east. Because the Genghis Khan eight white room is the god of all Mongolian beliefs. At that time, the situation was forced, but in desperation, the eight white room had to move west to the Xinglong Mountain in Gansu. On June 9, 1939, the Eight White Room embarked on a long road to the west. On June 21, the Eight White Room passed through Yan'an, and the Chinese Communist Party presented a wreath to the bier. On the couplet of the mourning hall, the two major ethnic groups of Mongolia and Han are more closely united, inheriting the spirit of Genghis Khan and fighting against the war, and the banner is the world giant. On June 25, the Eight White Room arrived in Xi'an, and along the street, the 200,000 people were welcome. The National Government held a grand national festival in accordance with the customs of the Mongolian nation. On July 1, 1939, the Eight White Room was placed in Xinglong Mountain, Gansu Province. In 1949, due to the chaos of the current situation, the government of the Republic of China moved the Eight White Room to the Qinghai Kumbum Monastery.\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been transferred to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In 1954, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China moved the Eight White Room back to Ejin Hollow. [5]\n\nIn 2001, the State Council approved the withdrawal of Ikezhao League and the establishment of the prefecture-level Ordos City.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, the State Council approved the “Request for the Establishment of Kangbashi District in Ordos City” of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: agreed to set up Kangbashi District, and will be the Habagesh Street, Qingshan Street and Binhe Street in Dongsheng District of Ordos City. It is placed under the jurisdiction of the Kangbash district.\n\nOrdos's prefectural administrative region occupies and covers the bigger part of the Ordos Desert, although the urban area itself is relatively small. It borders the prefecture-level divisions of Hohhot to the east, Baotou to the northeast, Bayan Nur to the north, Alxa League to the northwest, Wuhai to the west, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to its southwest, and the provinces of Shaanxi and Shanxi to the south. The maximal north-south extent is , while from east to west it stretches for .\n\nThe most populous municipality is Dongsheng which had a population of 582,544 inhabitants as of the 2010 census. Another urban area is the conglomeration of Kangbashi District and the adjacent township of Altan Xire. Kangbashi is to the north of the Wulan Mulun River, a tributary of the Yellow River, while Altan Xire is to the south of the same river.\n\nThe area of Ordos Shi can roughly be divided into a hilly area in the east, high plateaus in the west and center, sandy deserts in the north and south, and plains at the southern bank of the Yellow River. The highest elevation, at , is located in the west, the lowest point, at , is in the east.\n\nThere are two large deserts in the territory of Ordos Shi: Kubuqi Desert in the north and the Mu Us (Maowusu) Desert in the south. The Kubuqi Desert occupies 19.2% of Ordos, or , while the Maowusu Desert takes up 28.8% of the area, or .\n\nOrdos features a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSk\"), marked by long, cold and very dry winters; very warm, somewhat humid summers; and strong winds, especially in spring. The annual precipitation is in the eastern part of the city and in the western part. Most of the rain falls between July and September, with very little snow in winter; average annual evaporation reaches . In the city proper, the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . Sunshine duration averages 2,700 to 3,200 hours annually.\n\nOrdos is one the most prosperous regions of China when measured by GDP figures. With a nominal per-capita GDP of US$34,352 and ppp per capita GDP of $65,192 in 2016, it ranks first among prefecture-level divisions in the entire Chinese mainland, and second in the PRC (including Hong Kong & Macau), behind Macau (Nominal GDP per capita: US$67,079; GDP (PPP) per capita: $96,148). It is extremely rich in natural resources, having one sixth of the national coal reserves. The pillars of its economy are textiles (wool), coal mining, petrochemicals, electricity generation, production of building materials, and bitcoin mining. An industrial park in Dalad Banner is home to one of the world's largest bitcoin 'mines' - really a massive server farm - owned by Beijing-based Bitmain.\n\nOrdos Shi is divided into two districts and seven banners:\n\nA large, sparsely inhabited urban real estate development has been constructed from Dongsheng District. Intended to house a million people, it remains mostly uninhabited. Intended to have 300,000 residents by 2010, government figures stated it had 28,000. It has been the subject of several speculative publication, including an illustrated feature series conducted by \"Al Jazeera\" in 2010. The \"Daily Mail\" has documented Ordos/Kangbashi and tried to expose the trend of facile urban developments in China.\n\nIn 2011, a 49,400-square-meter museum, entitled Ordos Museum (), was opened in Kangbashi. The museum, designed by China-based architectural practice MAD Studio, focuses upon the history of the Ordos area, as well as on the culture and traditions of Inner Mongolia.\n\nTravel within Ordos City is primarily made by car or bus, using the city's network roads. Two tolled expressways, the G18 Rongcheng–Wuhai Expressway and the G65 Baotou–Maoming Expressway, provide connections with other towns and cities including Dongsheng.\n\nIn 2016, the in the city opened. The station is on the Beijing-Baotou railway, the Hohhot-Ordos high-speed railway line, and the Baotou-West railway. High speed trains to the provincial capital of Hohhot are run on a daily basis.

{"id": "2249702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2249702", "title": "Strangefolk", "text": "Strangefolk\n\nStrangefolk is a rock-oriented jam band originally from Burlington, VT. Since forming in 1991, the band has released five studio albums, four live albums and one live concert DVD. The band consists of Jon Trafton (\"lead guitar, vocals\"), Erik Glockler (\"bass, vocals\"), Reid Genauer (\"rhythm guitar, vocals\"), and Luke Smith (\"drums\").\n\nOriginally formed at the University of Vermont as an acoustic duo \"Strange Folk\" in 1991 with Trafton and other founding member Reid Genauer, Strangefolk (now one word) added bass and drums within a year and took to playing the bars in and around the vibrant musical community of Burlington, Vermont. After only a couple years of developing their signature sound in and around the Vermont music scene, the band began touring the club and college circuit around the Northeast, quickly gaining momentum and popularity with each tour. Regional tours paved the way for national tours, with the band logging over 100 shows per year. In 1998, Strangefolk signed with Mammoth Records, only to have the record deal collapse when Disney purchased Mammoth in 1999. \"A Great Long While\", which was to be the band's major-label debut and was produced by Nile Rodgers, was released independently in 2000.\n\nIn September 2000, following the band's annual Garden of Eden Festival in New Haven, Vermont, founding member and primary songwriter Genauer left the band to pursue a graduate degree at Cornell University, as well as other personal reasons. He had grown weary of Strangefolk's hectic touring schedule and was discontent with the end of the band's record deal and the direction of the band. In 2002, Genauer formed Assembly of Dust, which continues to tour today.\n\nAfter auditions in New York City in the Fall of 2000, Strangefolk invited Luke \"Patchen\" Montgomery to join the band, along with keyboardist Scott Shdeed. The newly aligned group began touring once again in early 2001. Shdeed was replaced on keyboards in October 2001 by Don Scott. The current line-up was completed when drummer Luke Smith left the band for personal reasons in September 2003. After the band took a brief hiatus from touring, Trey Anastasio Band drummer Russ Lawton joined Strangefolk in April 2004.\n\nIn early 2005, Strangefolk was once again forced to take a break from playing and touring when Jon Trafton was diagnosed with cancer. While Trafton underwent treatment, the other members of the band formed a side project called \"The Windfalls\" with guitarist Steve Jones of the band \"The Boneheads\". Following nearly a year of treatment and overwhelming support from his family, friends, band mates and fans, Trafton is cancer-free and Strangefolk began playing on a more regular basis once again in 2006.\n\nAt their Garden of Eden music festival in September 2006, the band debuted another side project dubbed \"The Tells\". Consisting of all five members of Strangefolk, \"The Tells\" played a late-night two-hour set of music consisting entirely of Led Zeppelin cover songs. The band repeated this performance again in October 2006, opening for themselves under the moniker \"The Tells\" at a concert in Burlington, VT. In September 2007 \"The Tells\" performed a Jack White themed late night set at the StrangeCreek Festival in Greenfield, MA, covering songs by The White Stripes and The Raconteurs.\n\nIn 1997, fans of Strangefolk started a small charitable organization called Strangers Helping Strangers, collecting non-perishable food items at several of the band's concerts throughout New England. Since then, the organization (also referred to as SHS) has expanded to work with hundreds of other bands throughout the US. In 2011, SHS ran food drives at 368 events. In 2012, SHS re-organized with a new board of directors, new organizational structure, and a renewed mission to feed the hungry one concert at a time.\n\nOn January 10, 2012 the band announced a pair of reunion shows (in Burlington, VT on 3/30/12 and Portland, ME on 3/31/12) with founding members Reid Genauer, Jon Trafton, Erik Glockler, and Luke Smith. This was the first time the original lineup has played together formally onstage since their farewell Garden of Eden concert in New Haven, VT in September 2000. The original lineup has performed occasional concerts throughout 2012 and 2013, including two appearances at The Gathering of the Vibes, as well as concerts at venues such as The Paradise Rock Club and the Wilbur Theater in Boston, MA, and The Capital Theater in Port Chester, NY.\n\n\n\n[ Strangefolk at Allmusic.com]\n"}
